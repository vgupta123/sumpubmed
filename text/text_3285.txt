BACKGROUND
embryonic stem cells  are self-renewable and show a pluripotent ability to differentiate into cellular derivatives of all three primary germ layers. they are considered to be a unique biological system for disclosing the mechanisms of pluripotency and lineage commitment, and a useful material for disease modeling, pharmacological screening, and cell therapy.

all-trans retinoic acid , which is a metabolic product of vitamin a , is one of the most important morphogens but with pleiotropic actions - it induces development of several lineages  <cit> . ra is an established signaling molecule involved in neuronal patterning, neural differentiation and axon outgrowth  <cit> . it is of great importance to understand well the mechanism of action of ra on the development of the nervous system. ra is known to be capable of inducing escs to differentiate into neurons within embryoid bodies  in vitro  <cit> . however, the route by which ra influences neural commitment is still obscure. furthermore, it is difficult to dissect and manipulate differentiation within ebs because they are multicellular agglomerations of extra-embryonic endoderm and definitive ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal derivatives  <cit> .

in this study, we used a monolayer culture system of neural induction  <cit>  and treated the cultures with low concentration of ra , which ranged between the physiological  and pharmacological  levels  <cit> . we found that among ra nuclear receptors - retinoic acid receptors  and retinoid × receptors , and ra-metabolizing enzymes , only the mrnas of rarα, rarγ, rxrβ, cyp26a <dig> and raldh <dig> were detectable in mouse escs. upon stimulation with ra, the nuclear receptors and ra-metabolizing enzymes showed dynamic changes in expression. in ra-treated cultures, the specific marker for escs, i.e., oct <dig>  was down-regulated more rapidly, and markers for neural cells were up-regulated sooner than in the other two control groups. we reported that ra-promoted neural differentiation was blocked by the rarα-selective antagonist ro 41- <dig>  which indicates that ra signaling is essential for neural specification in this monolayer culture system, and rarα pathway may play a key role in this effect. furthermore, our data demonstrated that the process of this enhanced neural differentiation involved crosstalk between ra and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  and wnt pathways.

RESULTS
 <dig>  ra causes earlier expression of sox <dig> in escs
to assess whether ra could promote escs entry to the neural lineage in a monolayer culture system, 46c escs were transferred into a differentiation induction regime which comprised an adherent monolayer culture without any exogenous growth factors  <cit> , or with ra or solvent . it is believed that the first conditions are permissive for neural commitment driven by autocrine signaling  <cit> . during experiments, we found that high does of ra  showed an obvious noxious effect on cell survival . therefore, we treated the cultures with low concentration of ra , which was between the physiological  and pharmacological  levels  <cit> .

cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry for sox1gfp expression, which is the earliest known specific marker of neuroectoderm in the mouse embryo  <cit> . 46c escs without treatment with any exogenous growth factors  or after treatment with ethanol  generated green fluorescent protein  positive cells progressively after an initial lag: almost no gfp+ cells were detected after  <dig> h, and only  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  or  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  after  <dig> h. in contrast, 10- <dig> m ra-treated cultures contained about 1% gfp+ cells at  <dig> h, which increased dramatically to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> h .

10- <dig> m ra increased the number of cells in the monolayer culture at the early stage of neural induction . therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that ra can also act after specification to increase the survival and/or proliferation of neural precursors. we cultured cells without ra for  <dig> h, and then treated the adherent cultures with ra. we observed an increase in the number of sox1gfp+ cells after treatment with ra . however, it is still hard to judge whether the increase in sox1gfp+ cells was caused by the survival and/or proliferative effects of ra on neural precursors or by its neural differentiation effects on escs. therefore, we obtained some purified sox1gfp+ cells by culturing cells without ra for  <dig> days and selecting sox1gfp+ cells by treatment with  <dig>  μg/ml puromycin for another  <dig> days. these purified sox1gfp+ cells were treated with or without ra for several days. after treatment with ra, there was a dramatic decrease in sox1gfp+ cells . moreover, cultures at clonal density showed that there were almost no clones that contained gfp+ cells in control and solvent control cultures, while more than 80% of clones contained gfp+ cells in ra-treated cultures . these data suggested that the observed initial increase in frequency of sox1gfp-expressing cells was not caused mainly by the survival and/or proliferative effects of ra on neural precursors but by its neural differentiation effects on escs.

to test further whether ra directly promoted esc differentiation, we examined the cell-density dependence of neural specification. neural induction of escs during monolayer differentiation is strongly inhibited by even modest increases in cell density  <cit> . cells treated with 10- <dig> m ra generated far fewer sox1gfp+ neural precursors at high cell density  than those at low cell density , while in control and solvent control cultures, cells almost completely eliminated neural specification at high density . this suggested that ra affected neural specification of escs also in a cell-density dependent manner.

we also noted a difference in the variability of gfp intensity between cultures. control or solvent control cultures contained a mixture of less intensely gfp+ cells , whereas ra-treated cells showed uniformly moderate gfp expression .

the effects of ra at the onset of esc differentiation were indicated by the kinetics and pattern of gene regulation. one of the key marker genes oct <dig> was examined. oct <dig>  a critical determinant of the pluripotent state, is down-regulated early during somatic differentiation  <cit> . within  <dig> days of leukemia inhibitory factor  and serum withdrawal, oct <dig> mrna decreased dramatically in ra-treated cells, while there was a smaller decrease in control or solvent control cells; after day  <dig>  almost no oct <dig> expression was observed in ra-treated cultures .

in summary, these data indicated that ra acted at the initial stages of esc differentiation to promote the transition into neuroectoderm.

 <dig>  ra facilitates emergence of neural progenitors, neural stem cells and neurons
to ensure that ra indeed accelerated neural specification, we assayed multiple markers of neural progenitors, neural stem cells and neurons by rt-pcr and q-pcr . pax <dig>  and nestin  were detected readily in ra-treated cultures at day  <dig>  while no obvious expression was found in control and solvent control cultures. other markers of neural stem/progenitor cells, such as blbp  , olig <dig>  and musashi , were all expressed earlier in ra-treated cultures. tuj <dig> , ncam   and map <dig>  , were also expressed earlier in ra-treated cultures than in control or solvent control cultures.

we also used fluorescence microscopy and western blot to monitor the expression of markers for neural stem cells, neurons and glia. at day  <dig>  with the rapid disappearance of oct4+ cells, sox1gfp+ and nestin+ cells were found in ra-treated cultures . the expression of tuj <dig> was upregulated at day  <dig> in ra-treated cultures, while  <dig> days later, tuj1+ cells appeared in control and solvent control cultures . with the accelerated emergence of neural stem cells and immature neurons, the expression of neuronal nuclei  and glial fibrillary acidic protein  was also upregulated, and map2+ and gfap+ cells also appeared earlier in ra-treated cultures . at day  <dig>  in control and solvent control cultures, most cells were nestin+ and were in the rosette conformations that is typical of neuroepithelial cells , whereas in ra-treated cultures, although nestin+ cells were still distributed in the rosette pattern, the percentage of nestin+ cells was obviously lower .

these findings indicated clearly that ra actually facilitated the differentiation of neural progenitors and neural stem cells, and as a consequence, neurons and glial cells appeared earlier in ra-treated cultures.

 <dig>  requirement for the ra signaling during efficient neural specification of escs
to assess the potential contribution of the ra pathway to esc fate, we investigated the expression of ra nuclear receptors and ra-metabolizing enzymes in mouse escs. among rars , rxrs  and ra-metabolizing enzymes , only rarα, rarγ, rxrβ, cyp26a <dig> and raldh <dig> were detected readily by rt-pcr of total rna prepared from 46c escs . notably, at the early stage of differentiation, only the expression of rarα, raldh <dig> and cyp26a <dig> showed obvious differences between ra-treated and control cultures . this hinted that these three molecules might play important roles in the promoted neural specification effect of ra. therefore, we used a pharmacological approach to interfere with the rarα pathway.

when 46c escs were exposed to the rarα-selective antagonist ro 41- <dig>  <cit>  during the monolayer differentiation, the majority of cells failed to become sox1gfp+ neural cells. after  <dig> h of differentiation, <10% of inhibitor-treated cells became sox1gfp+ compared with around 40% of cells exposed to dmso vehicle . many inhibitor-treated cells remained oct4+ during this period . ro 41- <dig> also inhibited neural differentiation in the culture without ra .

our observations suggested that blockade of the rarα pathway initially impeded lineage commitment, and ra signaling was required for the efficient neural specification of escs.

 <dig>  ra acts upstream of map kinase/erk kinase  to promote neural specification
in vertebrate embryos, neural induction requires fibroblast growth factor  signaling through the ras-erk pathway  <cit> . this also appears to be true for escs, in which the initial stimulus is most likely provided by autocrine fgf <dig>  <cit> . to test whether ra bypassed this requirement, we used three pharmacological inhibitors . su <dig> inhibits the fgf receptor tyrosine kinase  <cit> ; pd <dig> and pd <dig> are both able to block mek1/ <dig>  upstream of erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . all of these inhibitors are able to block neural specification of escs  <cit> . ra-treated cells remained susceptible to blockade of neural induction by the two mek1/ <dig> inhibitors, pd <dig> and pd <dig>  while they were less susceptible to blockade of neural induction by fgf receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor su <dig> . notably, su <dig> and pd <dig> markedly decreased cell number in ra-treated monolayer cultures, while pd <dig> achieved the same suppressive effect on erk activation as pd <dig>  without the dramatic side effect on cell viability or proliferation . in the presence of su <dig>  most cells lost the oct <dig> marker of escs and differentiated under the driving force of ra. however, in the presence of the two mek1/ <dig> inhibitors, many cells continued to proliferate in an apparently undifferentiated oct4+ state with minimal generation of sox1gfp+ derivatives .

to assess whether ra affected activation of the erk pathway during neural specification, we detected phosphorylation of erk by western blotting. twelve hours after differentiation, a higher level of phosphorylated erk was observed in ra-treated cultures . the expression of the transcription factor elk <dig>  one of the downstream targets of erk  <cit> , was also up-regulated more in the ra-treated cultures than in the other two control cultures before day  <dig> .

these findings indicated that ra acted upstream of mek1/ <dig> in the neural induction cascade. ra may play a role in enhancing erk phosphorylation via mek1/ <dig> or its upstream but not in an fgf-signaling-dependent manner. the exact targets of ra remain to be determined.

 <dig>  wnt signaling is involved in ra-promoted neural specification
wnt signaling has been implicated in regulating neural differentiation of escs. the secreted wnt antagonist secreted frizzled-related protein  <dig>  is up-regulated during neural differentiation of escs, and over-expression of sfrp <dig> enhances neural differentiation. activation of the wnt pathway by treatment with lithium chloride  inhibits neural differentiation of escs  <cit> . to investigate the effect of wnt signaling, we added  <dig> mm licl to ra-treated cultures. almost no gfp+ cells were found in licl and ra co-treated cultures, and most of the cells lost the oct <dig> marker of escs . chir <dig>  a more selective inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>   <cit> , was also used. similar results were gained . q-pcr for the expression of sfrp <dig> showed that it was up-regulated at the early stage of differentiation . the two gsk <dig> inhibitors also inhibited neural differentiation in the culture without ra .

these findings showed that activation of wnt signaling blocked the effect of ra. however, the roles of ra and signaling molecules involved in wnt signaling still remain to be elucidated .

discussion
the pluripotent esc is a valuable in vitro model for studying the effects of various factors on cell lineage decisions in very early embryonic stages of mammalian development. in particular, the effects of ra signaling on the differentiation of escs and neural induction have been studied extensively. in addition to previous studies that have shown that ra promotes neural differentiation of escs  <cit> , the present study demonstrated that ra facilitated the emergence of neural progenitors, neural stem cells and neurons in a monolayer culture. this is a simple system that allows direct observation, analysis and manipulation of the process of neural specification without the confounding influence of cell aggregation, co-culture, uncharacterized media constituents, or cell selection  <cit> . furthermore, these results also demonstrated the novel and more precise molecular mechanisms of action of ra on neural differentiation.

 <dig>  effects of ra on escs differentiation
ra and other retinoids are potent regulators of morphogenesis, growth and cell differentiation. ra, which is abundant in mammalian nervous systems  <cit> , induces neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation from various sources, including escs  <cit> , dorsal root ganglia  <cit> , or neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . ra-induced neuronal differentiation is characterized by the expression of tissue-specific genes, proteins, ion channels, and receptors in a developmentally controlled manner  <cit> .

addition of ra promoted faster differentiation of escs, as indicated by the pattern of oct <dig> expression, which was down-regulated more rapidly in ra-treated cultures, and could not be detected after day <dig>  this is coincident with previous studies  <cit> . the expression levels of markers for undifferentiated neural cells, i.e., sox <dig>  pax <dig>  nestin, blbp, prominin, olig <dig> and musashi, were higher in ra-treated cultures. as a consequence, the expression levels of markers for neurons, i.e., tuj <dig>  map <dig>  and ncam, and glial cells, i.e., gfap were also elevated in ra-treated cultures. these findings are consistent with ra-induced differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the cell aggregation system, as described previously  <cit> .

the initial higher frequency of sox1gfp+ cells in ra-treated cultures is not caused mainly by the enhanced viability or proliferation of neural precursor cells. after treatment with ra, the number of purified sox1gfp+ neural precursor cells decreased dramatically, which indicated that ra could not maintain the sox1gfp+ state. this observation is coincident with the previous studies  <cit> . treatment of adherent cultures with ra after the appearance of the first sox1gfp+ cells increased the number of sox1gfp+ cells. one explanation may be that, in monolayer culture, the speed at which ra induced escs into sox1gfp+ neural precursor cells was faster than the speed of the loss of sox1gfp+ cells.

 <dig>  molecular mechanisms of action of ra on neural differentiation
 <dig>  ra signaling is involved in efficient neural specification of escs
it is proposed that the molecular mechanisms of action of ra during embryogenesis in vivo involve a complex signaling pathway. ra exerts its function by binding to cellular ra-binding proteins that interact with the nuclear ra receptors. ra binds to rars, which normally act as ligand-inducible transcription factors by binding as heterodimers with rxrs to ra response elements located in regulatory regions of target genes  <cit> . during in vitro differentiation of escs into the neuronal lineage, ra might act in the same way as it does in vivo. the hypothesis that in vitro and in vivo pathways are comparable is supported by significant up-regulation of rarα and rarβ mrna, but rapid down-regulation of rarγ and rxrγ mrna during ra-induced neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells  <cit> . this suggests a role for rarα, -β, -γ and rxrγ during neuroectodermal differentiation  <cit> . however, the mechanisms whereby ra induces neural differentiation of escs are not fully understood.

to demonstrate whether ra exerts its effects through ra-related nuclear receptors and to determine which receptors play more important roles in this efficient neural specification, we detected all six isoforms of rars and rxrs by rt-pcr or q-pcr. rarα, rarγ and rxrβ were detected in escs. during differentiation, few differences in the expression of rarγ and rxrβ were observed between the ra-treated and the two control groups, while obviously different expression of rarα was observed. in addition, the expression of rarα was up-regulated more at day  <dig> than at day  <dig>  these observations hint that rarα may play an important role in ra-treated efficient neural specification. adding the rarα-selective antagonist ro 41- <dig> effectively blocked the neural fate of escs, and many ra and ro 41- <dig> co-treated cells remained in an oct4+ state. these findings suggest that ra signaling is indeed involved in promotion of this neural fate, and the nuclear receptor rarα plays a key role in this effect.

 <dig>  ra activates the erk pathway during promoted neural specification
studies in planaria, frog embryos and avian embryos  <cit>  have suggested a primary requirement for fgf signaling in neural specification. fgf <dig> is produced in an autocrine fashion by undifferentiated escs  <cit>  and activates the ras-mek-erk intracellular signaling cascades  <cit> . in our study, fgf receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor su <dig> was used to try to block the neural specification effect of ra. this inhibitor could not significantly block the emergence of sox1gfp+ neural progenitor cells in the ra-treated monolayer cultures, although it had the ability to inhibit the neural specification of escs when ra was absent from the culture . on the other hand, the two inhibitors pd <dig> and pd <dig>  both of which can block mek1/ <dig>  upstream of erk1/ <dig>  were able to block neural specification of escs even in the ra-treated cultures, and some cells remained as oct4+ cells. all of these indicate that ra exerts its effects not through fgf signaling but requiring the activation of mek-erk signaling cascades. previous studies have reported that ra can activate the erk pathway in an unknown manner  <cit> . in our study, we also observed that phosphorylation of erk was up-regulated at the early stage during differentiation of escs in ra-treated cultures, and the transcription factor elk- <dig>  one of the downstream targets of erk  <cit> , was also more up-regulated in the ra-treated cultures than in the two control cultures before day <dig>  activated erk1/ <dig> also mediates phosphorylation of the mapk sites of smad <dig> , which inhibits the inhibitory function of the bone morphogenetic proteins -smad <dig> pathway on neural differentiation  <cit> .

based on the above, we propose that one possible mechanism of how ra promotes neural lineage entry by escs is that it enhances erk phosphorylation via mek1/ <dig> or its upstream but not via a mechanism that is dependent on fgf signaling, and blockade of ra signaling may affect the activation of the upstream of erk1/ <dig>  which leads to failure of neural specification of escs, even with the stimulation of fgf signaling .

 <dig>  wnt signaling also plays a role in ra-promoted neural differentiation
down-regulation of wnt signaling has been shown to be one of the mechanisms involved in ra-induced neural differentiation of mouse escs. up-regulation of sfrp <dig> can inhibit the wnt-β-catenin anti-neural pathway. conversely, adding licl, which inhibits gsk <dig> and partially mimics wnt signaling, can enhance the anti-neural pathway  <cit> . on the other hand, gsk <dig> mediated-smad <dig> phosphorylation can block the inhibitory effect of bmps on neural differentiation  <cit> . therefore, inhibition of gsk <dig> may also make the bmp-smad <dig> pathway become valid for inhibiting neural differentiation. interestingly, β-catenin, which is a key molecule in wnt signaling, has been shown to interact directly with rar, and as a result retinoids decrease activation of t-cell transcription factor  in cultured cells in a dose-dependent manner  <cit> .

in the present study, we found that ra up-regulated the expression of rarα and rarβ at the early stage of differentiation. we also investigated the effect of licl and another gsk <dig> inhibitor chir <dig>  negative effects of wnt pathways on neural differentiation were observed by adding the two inhibitors to ra-treated cultures, and most cells lost the marker of escs. ra also showed its effect on up-regulating the expression of sfrp <dig> 

based on the present and previous studies, ra may exert its effects through the following mechanisms .  ra promotes neural specification by up-regulating sfrp <dig>  the expression of sfrp <dig> is up-regulated by stimulation with ra, which blocks the message passing downstream from wnts  <cit> . upon adding licl or chir <dig>  which stimulates β-catenin and/or bmp signaling through inhibition of gsk <dig>  but not through wnts, the β-catenin pathway and/or bmp signaling can still play a part in suppressing neural specification, even with the stimulus of ra-up-regulated sfrp <dig>   ra may promote neural differentiation by up-regulating rar, which may decrease β-catenin-lymphoid enhancing factor /tcf mediated transactivation.  ra also may enhance the sequestration of β-catenin to suppress the anti-neural effects of the wnt-β-catenin pathway. however, this hypothesis needs further evidence.

CONCLUSIONS
our study showed that ra can promote neural lineage entry by escs in adherent monolayer culture systems. we also found that ra stimulation led to dramatic changes in ra nuclear receptor and ra-metabolizing enzyme expression. further study showed that these effects of ra depended on ra signaling and its crosstalk with the erk and wnt pathways. our study showed a more limpid circumscription of the effects of ra and its pathway on neural lineage choice of mouse escs.
