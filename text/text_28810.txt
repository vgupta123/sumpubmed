BACKGROUND
genomic instability is a hallmark of the vast majority of human cancers. the predominant form of genomic instability in human cancer is chromosome instability , which is characterized by gains or losses of whole chromosomes  and chromosomal structural aberrations  <cit> . recent studies have shown that cin and aneuploidy, a long time considered late progression events to be associated with tumors, indeed represent early molecular changes seen in preneoplastic lesions of human cancers  <cit> .

aneuploidy occurrence could generate in a single step multiple changes required for tumor initiation and progression and is frequently observed in clinical tumor specimens. however, it is still debated whether aneuploidy is the consequence or the cause of tumorigenesis  <cit> . duplicated chromosomes must be equally segregated between the two daughter cells during cell division, and errors in this process can lead to aneuploidy. the presence of chromosomal gains and losses, particularly at early stages of carcinogenesis, has suggested that the impairment of chromosome segregation fidelity might play a central role in the genesis of cancers. however, the mechanism responsible for aneuploidy in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis is poorly understood. at least two possible causes, not mutually exclusive, could be responsible for aneuploidy: mutations in genes encoding mitotic regulators, like spindle assembly checkpoint  proteins, and defects in centrosome homeostasis.

altered expression of genes involved in the sac that monitors the correct alignment and attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, such as bub <dig>  pttg <dig>  mad <dig>  and bub1b, induced aneuploidy in mammalian cells in culture, however, they were rarely found mutated in human tumors  <cit> . further studies provided evidence that reduced expression of some of these genes contributes to defective spindle checkpoint controls. in fact deletion of one mad <dig> allele resulted in a defective mitotic checkpoint in both human tumor cells and murine primary fibroblasts , and bub1b haploinsufficiency in mice resulted in defective mitotic arrest as well as tumors  <cit> . recently, it was reported a hereditary mutation of the bub1b gene in patients with mosaic variegated aneuploidy  a rare genetic disease with increased cancer risk  <cit> . furthermore, mad <dig> overexpression was associated with stable inactivation of the retinoblastoma  gene by specific short hairpin rnas   <cit> .

already in the past century theodor boveri  observed that cells with supernumerary centrosomes mis-segregated their chromosomes through the assembly of multipolar spindles. centrosome amplification  is a frequent event observed in the majority of solid tumors and it has also been detected in leukemia and lymphoma cells  <cit> . moreover, centrosome amplification has been associated with genetic instability observed in prostate  <cit>  and breast cancer  <cit>  as well as in preinvasive cancer lesions  <cit> . then, the correct centrosome number, necessary to assemble a bipolar mitotic spindle, is essential for chromosome segregation fidelity thus preventing cin and aneuploidy.

alterations in the two major tumor suppressors rb and tp <dig> have been reported to affect chromosome stability. overexpression of cyclin-e and mutation of hcdc <dig> gene have been associated with cin and centrosome amplification  <cit> , and recently it has been reported that also p <dig> deficient cells needed cyclin-e overexpression to induce cin and multiple centrosomes  <cit> . halting mitotic progression in human and murine prb deficient primary fibroblasts resulted in supernumerary centrosomes and aneuploidy  <cit> . inactivation of prb in human keratinocytes  <cit>  by expression of the hpv16-e <dig> oncoprotein as well a transient g1/s cell cycle arrest in human fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts  with prb dysfunction also generated multiple centrosomes and aneuploidy  <cit> . therefore, a tightly controlled coupling of centrosome and dna replication and the mitotic cycle is necessary to generate correct segregation for both chromosomes and centrosomes.

to avoid any side effects caused by additional gene alterations present in tumor cell lines, we used imr <dig> human diploid primary fibroblasts to investigate the mechanism by which cells might become aneuploid. to this aim we analyzed the effects of acute loss of the retinoblastoma  gene function on centrosomes and genomic instability by using the rna interference  knockdown methodology. here we show that in addition to supernumerary centrosomes acutely prb-depleted human fibroblasts harbored micronuclei. our results indicate that micronuclei formation caused by aneugenic events leading to chromosome loss, likely originating from erroneous kinetochore attachment, and not spindle assembly checkpoint dysfunctions are the trigger for aneuploidy in prb-depleted primary human fibroblasts.

RESULTS
acute loss of prb in primary human fibroblasts generates supernumerary centrosomes, aneuploidy and changes in expression of genes necessary for centrosome duplication and mitotic progression
previously, we showed that in prb deficient human cells  centrosome amplification triggered aneuploidy  <cit>  and acute loss of prb in mefs caused centrosome amplification and aneuploidy  <cit> . however, because hpv16-e <dig> oncoprotein could have additional cellular effects besides prb inactivation, and murine cells have less stringent checkpoints than human cells, we used primary human fibroblasts to investigate whether prb acute loss by rna interference affected chromosomal stability. conventional rt-pcr and western blotting showed that transfection of sirna oligonucleotides specifically targeting rb reduced both rb transcript and protein levels when compared with cells transfected with control sirna . reduction in gene expression was transient as shown by rb re-expression after additional  <dig> hours in culture .

the immediate early effects of prb transient post-transcriptional silencing  on centrosome homeostasis were revealed by detection of the centrosomal component γ-tubulin . rb acute loss generated supernumerary centrosomes  in 20% of cells in comparison to control cells  that showed only 5% of cells with multiple centrosomes. the number of prb-depleted cells with amplified centrosomes decreased after ten days in culture . supernumerary centrosomes generating multipolar spindle, as revealed after β-tubulin immunostaining, might be responsible for chromosomal missegregation and successive aneuploidy observed after acute loss of prb in human fibroblasts .

then we addressed whether these cells had acquired genomic instability by carrying out conventional cytogenetics analyses. alterations in the normal number of chromosomes were frequently observed in human fibroblasts acutely depleted of prb but not in their wild-type parental counterpart. karyotype analysis done after  <dig> days from sirnas transfection revealed aneuploidy in 50% of analyzed metaphases  and the majority  were hypodiploid . recently, we found that in prb deficient murine cells acute loss of prb induced altered expression of genes involved in centrosome homeostasis and mitosis progression  <cit> . then, we determined whether also in primary human fibroblasts acute loss of prb altered the expression of some genes involved in chromosomal/centrosome dynamics that might be relevant for genomic stability. quantitative real time rt-pcr confirmed that imr <dig> cells at  <dig> hours from transfection had a very low level of rb expression . we found increased transcripts levels of genes necessary for centrosome duplication and mitotic progression as aurora-a and plk <dig> . in addition prb acute loss was associated with decreased mad <dig> transcript levels  a gene belonging to the category of the spindle assembly checkpoint  genes. western blotting  and successive densitometry analysis of western blots confirmed real time rt-pcr results. in particular quantification of western blot band intensity indicated a two-fold increase for aurora-a protein level, about  <dig>  fold change for plk <dig> protein level and a 50% reduction of mad <dig> protein level.

evaluation of the spindle assembly checkpoint involvement in triggering chromosomal instability of rb silenced imr <dig> cells
several lines of evidence implicate that a weakened spindle assembly checkpoint  could be responsible for the generation of aneuploid cells  <cit> . the observed decrease in mad <dig> expression in transient rb silenced imr <dig> cells , resulting in the reduction of a critical sac component, might be consistent with this view. to determine if other mitotic checkpoint genes in addition to mad <dig> were also altered in transient rb silenced imr <dig> cells we extended the real time rt-pcr to other genes involved in cell cycle, centrosome duplication and spindle assembly checkpoint. our analysis showed a marked decrease in the expression of bub1b and cdc <dig> , pttg <dig> and chfr  in prb acutely depleted cells in comparison to control cells . in addition we detected differential expression of genes coding for centromeric proteins namely centromere protein-a  overexpression and centromere protein-f  down-regulation. altogether, the reduced expression levels of these genes suggested a possible sac dysfunction following prb acute loss. to this aim we estimated the number of mitotic cells  in prb-depleted cells after treatment with the mitotic inhibitor colcemid that depolymerizes microtubules and blocks metaphase-anaphase transition by activating the sac. our data indicated that both prb-competent and prb-depleted cells arrested in mitosis exhibiting an increased mitotic index  . furthermore, to determine that prb-depleted cells arrested because of sac activation we looked at kinetochore accumulation of mad <dig>  another crucial sac component, after challenging the checkpoint with colcemid. to this end we looked at mad <dig> localization of both prb-competent and prb-depleted imr <dig> cells, treated with colcemid or left untreated, by immunofluorescence microscopy. as expected after colcemid treatment mad <dig> accumulated at kinetochores of both prb-competent and prb-depleted cells . on the contrary no mad <dig> signals were detected in both prb-competent and prb-depleted untreated cells . these results indicate that human fibroblasts acutely depleted of prb possess a functional sac, suggesting that prb-depleted cells did not undergo a cell cycle arrest before reaching mitosis as revealed by the decrease in gene expression of mitotic genes we observed by real time rt-pcr . therefore, previous findings that tumor cells with mad <dig> haploinsufficiency did not arrest in mitosis and proceed into a subsequent s phase after mitotic poison treatment  <cit> , are likely to be attributed to some additional genetic mutations present in these tumor cell lines tested.

genome instability caused by prb acute loss depends neither on plk <dig> nor on aurora-a overexpression
to investigate the role of aurora-a and plk <dig> overexpression on centrosome amplification and genomic instability we silenced them by rna interference  in acutely prb-depleted cells. real time rt-pcr showed reduced levels of rb, as well as aurora-a and plk <dig> transcripts, in imr <dig> cells subjected to knock-down of both rb and aurora-a or plk <dig> . western blot analysis confirmed protein decrease in post-transcriptionally silenced cells . by immunofluorescence microscopy  we observed that cells with multiple centrosomes were slightly reduced after simultaneous rnai of rb and plk <dig>  in comparison to rb alone post-transcriptionally silenced cells . in contrast post-transcriptional rb and aurora-a silencing caused a marked reduction of supernumerary centrosomes in rb/aurora-a post-transcriptionally silenced cells . these findings suggest that centrosome amplification observed in rb depleted fibroblasts as well in rb/plk <dig> depleted cells might depend on aurora-a overexpression. however, real time rt-pcr done after rb/plk <dig> double knockdown revealed a very low level of aurora-a mrna  suggesting that in these cells centrosome amplification did not depend, at least in part, on aurora-a overexpression. next, we did conventional cytogenetics to evaluate the presence of aneuploidy in rb/plk <dig> and rb/aurora-a post-transcriptionally silenced fibroblasts. we scored an increase in hypodiploid cells both in rb/plk <dig> and rb/aurora-a post-transcriptionally silenced fibroblasts . these findings suggest that prb acute loss could promote genomic instability that depends neither on plk <dig> nor on aurora-a overexpression. alternatively, both up-regulation and down-regulation of these two genes could affect genomic stability in primary prb-depleted cells. in addition the presence of supernumerary centrosomes did not seem the only cause leading to genomic instability in rb post-transcriptionally silenced cells. in the attempt to establish a possible role for the observed plk <dig> or aurora-a overexpression in rb post-transcriptionally silenced cells, we looked at proliferation of these cells in culture. following simultaneous rna interference of rb/plk <dig> and rb/aurora-a, imr <dig> cells showed a delay in cell proliferation already at  <dig> hours, and at ten days from transfection these post-transcriptionally silenced cells underwent a permanent arrest. on the contrary prb alone depleted cells recovered from the initial proliferation delay as soon as two days from transfection . moreover, western blot analyses showed increased levels of p21cip <dig> in cells with knock-down of both rb and aurora-a or plk <dig> but not in rb alone depleted cells, suggesting a possible arrest of proliferation in a small fraction of cells co-depleted for rb and either plk <dig> or aurora-a. the decreased amounts of cyclin-e and cyclin-a observed in rb/plk <dig> and rb/aurora-a double knocked-down imr <dig> cells in comparison with the rb single knocked-down imr <dig> cells are consistent with a proliferation delay of these cells .

micronuclei generation occurred following rb acute loss in imr <dig> human primary fibroblasts
to investigate a possible mechanism by which rb acute loss participates in the generation of aneuploid cells we did cytogenetics analysis looking for the presence of micronuclei. micronuclei are considered a marker of chromosome damage  formed during mitosis and identified in interphase as small bodies of extra chromatin in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. we found the presence of micronuclei in prb-depleted cells  as well as in both rb/plk <dig>  and rb/aurora-a  double knockdown cells . to determine whether micronuclei harbored acentric chromosomal fragments or whole chromosomes we investigated the presence of centromeres in these micronuclei. immunofluorescence microscopy conducted using an anti-centromere antibody  showed that micronuclei contained centromeres suggesting the presence of whole chromosomes therein . the control wild type cells did not show the presence of micronuclei by fluorescence microscopy . in addition immunofluorescence microscopy showed the presence of more than one centromeric signal in micronuclei of rb silenced cells suggesting the loss of more than one chromosome per cell, that is consistent with the hypodiploid phenotype displayed by prb-depleted cells. micronuclei might originate by the presence of lagging chromosomes observed during anaphase in human fibroblasts after rb acute loss . this result suggests that micronuclei, which remain separate from the nucleus after nuclear division, might be the most likely way by which prb-depleted cells become hypodiploid.

discussion
chromosomal instability plays an important role in the initiation, progression and aggressiveness of cancer cells. unlike point mutations that affect only some genes, gains or losses of chromosomes  altering dramatically gene expression could generate in a single step multiple changes required for tumor initiation and progression. an aneuploid cell will usually have a higher number of chromosomes  and will not divide properly, resulting in two cells with different numbers of chromosomes. the mechanisms implicated in the formation of aneuploid cells are still not fully understood. both alterations in genes controlling centrosome homeostasis and defects in genes encoding mitotic checkpoint proteins could trigger aneuploidy. the presence of supernumerary centrosomes is considered a possible cause of both chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. supernumerary centrosomes have been associated with p <dig> and prb dysfunction caused by the presence of hpv16-e <dig> and -e <dig> oncoproteins  <cit> . however, we showed that prb but not p <dig> deficient human cells resulted in aneuploid cells by allowing dna re-replication associated with centrosomes amplification  <cit> .

in mammalian cells dna replication and centrosome duplication must be completed successfully before mitosis and are tightly regulated by a control network in which prb plays a crucial role. previously, we showed that centrosome amplification and aneuploidy occurred only after a prolonged g1/s arrest in mefs stably devoid of prb. in addition the presence of these alterations in prb acutely depleted mefs highlighted the importance of prb in the control of genetic stability  <cit> .

here we demonstrate for the first time that rb acute loss triggers centrosome amplification and aneuploidy in human primary fibroblasts. we observed reduced expression of crucial spindle assembly checkpoint  components suggesting that this checkpoint might be weakened in these cells and in turn it might be responsible for the observed aneuploidy. however, though fibroblasts acutely depleted of prb showed mad <dig> reduction, they did not show premature sister chromatid separation  that is a hallmark of tumor cells with reduced levels of mad <dig> and mitotic checkpoint dysfunction  <cit> . in addition when prb acutely depleted imr <dig> cells were treated with the mitotic poison colcemid they accumulated in mitosis indicating activation and functionality of the sac checkpoint. altogether these findings suggest that aneuploidy might not be triggered by sac dysfunction in human primary fibroblasts acutely depleted of prb.

recently, it was reported that mad <dig> up-regulation because of stable prb depletion by short hairpin rnas  led to chromosomal instability in human cells  <cit> . the explanation for this effect of overexpressed mad <dig> was that part of the population adapted to the activated checkpoint and entered the cell cycle as polyploid cells that in turn could cause chromosome missegregation in the subsequent mitoses. on the contrary our results indicated that acute loss of rb in normal human fibroblasts did not cause mad <dig> overexpression. our findings suggest that the previously observed mad <dig> overexpression could be a specific feature of cells stably depleted of prb. indeed, we found that mad <dig> was overexpressed in imr <dig> human fibroblasts stably depleted of prb by transfection of a shrna-mir  targeting specifically human rb . we found mad <dig> up-regulation also in prb-depleted hct <dig> cells , where this up-regulation likely depended on overexpression of brca <dig> that binds to the transcription factor oct- <dig> and up-regulates mad <dig> transcription  <cit> . thus, additional genetic changes that occurred during the selection of rb stably depleted cells might be the explanation for up-regulation and to be involved in overriding the mitotic checkpoint if activated.

critical regulators of mitotic progression and centrosome duplication such as plk <dig> and aurora-a that are expressed in a cell cycle dependent manner were also upregulated after rb acute loss. recently, it has been shown that activation of the rb pathway resulted in the repression of plk <dig> promoter activity that depended on the swi/snf chromatin-remodeling complex  <cit> . aurora-a overexpression following prb depletion is consistent with recent finding that this kinase is under the transcriptional control of e2f <dig>  <cit> , a partner of prb in the regulation of cell cycle transitions. also plk <dig> has been reported to be regulated by e2f <dig> in bladder cancer cells in addition to known e2f <dig> targets such as cyclin a and novel targets including pituitary tumor transforming gene  <dig> , and caveolin- <dig>  <cit> . very recently, several findings have outlined the existence of the functional crosstalk between plk <dig> and aurora-a. plk <dig> is activated before mitosis by aurora-a and its cofactor bora  <cit> . furthermore, in mitosis bora degradation is plk <dig> dependent, and plk <dig> is also required for the timely destruction of aurora-a in late anaphase  <cit> . to understand the roles played by plk <dig> and aurora-a overexpression on centrosome amplification and aneuploidy, following prb acute depletion, we did post-transcriptional silencing of rb, plk <dig> and rb, aurora-a simultaneously. only rb/aurora-a silenced human fibroblasts showed a decrease in the percentage of cells with supernumerary centrosomes suggesting that aurora-a over-expression might be necessary for centrosome amplification to occur. however, rb/plk <dig> silenced cells showed low transcript levels for aurora-a suggesting that aurora-a overexpression could be in part responsible for centrosome amplification.

on the other hand conventional cytogenetics analysis showed the presence of aneuploidy  in both rb/aurora-a and rb/plk <dig> silenced fibroblasts, suggesting that neither aurora-a nor plk <dig> over-expression could account for chromosome instability observed in these prb-depleted cells. in this scenario it seems that aurora-a and plk <dig> over-expression affects primarily cell proliferation following prb depletion in human primary fibroblasts. in fact simultaneous post-transcriptional silencing of rb/aurora-a and rb/plk <dig> resulted in delayed cell cycle progression consistent with the decreased cyclin -e and -a levels, the reduced mitotic index as well as the increased p21cip <dig> level. surprisingly, we observed that aneuploid cells induced by prb depletion were mostly hypodiploid. the unexpected finding that aneuploidy in prb-depleted human normal cells is characterized by a unbalanced number of cells with chromosome loss relative to gain, is consistent with what has been recently reported for cenp-e+/- mice, where hypodiploid cells are better tolerated than hyperdiploid cells in vivo  <cit> . a molecular mechanism underlying this phenotype might involve lack of attachment or erroneous kinetochores attachment to the mitotic spindle. merotelic kinetochore attachment that occurs when a kinetochore binds mitotic microtubules from both spindle poles could explain hypodiploidy generation  <cit> . chromosomes with merotelic orientation that are not detected by the sac because they do not expose unattached centromeres, could result in lagging chromosomes that persisting until anaphase onset would originate micronuclei upon nuclear envelope reconstitution at the end of mitosis  <cit> . micronuclei are considered a possible cause of chromosome loss during mitosis resulting in the generation of hypodiploid cells that lack few chromosomes. indeed immunofluorescence microscopy performed in prb-depleted cells and in rb/aurora-a and rb/plk <dig> knockdown cells showed the presence of micronuclei containing whole chromosomes. an alternative hypothesis might be that micronuclei originate in rb silenced cells by defects in kinetochore assembling that generates dysfunctional centromere unable to contact correctly mitotic microtubules. then, altered expression and dosage of some centromere components by promoting defects in kinetochore assembling could trigger micronuclei generation resulting in unfaithful chromosome segregation during mitosis. expression studies have suggested a correlation between altered expression of several centromere proteins and cancer. accordingly, in acutely prb-depleted human primary fibroblasts we found altered expression of genes coding for two centromere proteins: namely cenp-a that was overexpressed and cenp-f that was underexpressed. cenp-a overexpression might cause a spreading of centromere heterochromatin which might interfere with the correct kinetochore complex assembling and then cause cin as reported in colorectal cancer tissues  <cit> . cenp-f  associates preferentially with kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes and is degraded upon completion of mitosis, both its overexpression and underexpression has been reported in cancer  <cit> . altogether, our results suggest that prb plays a critical role in regulating chromosome stability in human primary fibroblasts and its deficiency triggers defects in chromosome segregation via micronuclei formation. in fact prb depleted primary human fibroblasts did not show sac dysfunction despite decreased expression of some sac genes. thus, micronuclei could represent a mechanism underlying chromosome instability following rb acute loss and they could explain maintenance of hypodiploidy also after that rb expression will be restored.

CONCLUSIONS
here we show for the first time that rb acute loss triggers centrosome amplification and aneuploidy in human primary fibroblasts. even though prb acutely depleted human fibroblasts showed mad <dig> reduction they did not show spindle assembly checkpoint  dysfunction when challenged with a mitotic poison.

our observation that prb-depleted cells were mostly hypodiploid suggests that micronuclei, likely caused by mis-attached kinetochores which in turn triggered chromosome segregation errors, are a possible cause of chromosome loss during mitosis resulting in the generation of aneuploid cells that lack few chromosomes. altogether, our results suggest that prb plays a critical role in regulating genomic stability in human primary fibroblasts and its deficiency induces defects in chromosome segregation via micronuclei formation and not by sac dysfunction.
