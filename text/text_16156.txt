BACKGROUND
from a physiological point of view, metals fall into three main categories, namely essential and non-toxic ; essential, but harmful at high concentrations , and toxic   <cit> . however, at high concentrations, both essential and nonessential metals can be harmful to the cell, damaging the cell membrane, the structure of dna, or changing the specificity of enzymes  <cit> . the microorganisms have developed homeostasis systems in order to maintain an optimal intracellular concentration of metals. this is achieved through controlling the processes of transport, intracellular trafficking, efflux and conservation, ensuring its bioavailability to cellular processes and preventing damage to cellular components  <cit> .

studies support a role for horizontal gene transfer  in the evolution of metal homeostasis in proteobacteria, along with the identification of putative genomic islands , with examples in cupriavidus metallidurans, pseudomonas putida kt <dig> and comamonas testosteroni s <dig>  <cit> . in fact, many microorganisms have genes located on chromosomes, plasmids, or transposons encoding specific traits conferring resistance to a variety of metal ions  <cit> .

efflux is one of the main approaches used by bacteria to control internal metal ion concentrations, and several efflux systems have been described in bacteria. the p-type atpases use atp hydrolysis to promote ion transport and have been identified in efflux of both mono- and divalent cations from the cytoplasm  <cit> . the cation diffusion facilitator  are chemiosmotic ion/proton exchangers that present six transmembrane helices and are involved in the efflux of divalent metal cations  <cit> .

in gram-negative bacteria, the resistance-nodulation-division superfamily  includes systems that confer resistance to antibiotics and metals, and it is composed of a tripartite protein complex: an rnd protein, located in the cytoplasmic membrane, a periplasmic membrane fusion protein  and an outer-membrane channel protein   <cit> . these components form a channel that spans both membranes and the periplasmic space  <cit> . based on the nature of their substrate, the rnd superfamily was divided into seven families, of which the hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux , and the heavy-metal efflux  have been extensively studied  <cit> . nies further subdivided the hme-rnd proteins into sub-groups, according to the substrate they transport: hme <dig> , hme <dig> , hme3a , hme3b , hme <dig>  and hme <dig>   <cit> .

the cytoplasmic membrane rnd proteins have  <dig> transmembrane alpha helices , among which tmh iv contains amino acid residues that are conserved in most rnd proteins  <cit> . the hme1-rnd and hme2-rnd have the same motifs, dfg-dga-ven, present in proteins czca  or cnra and ncca   <cit> . both aspartate residues and the glutamate residue in tmh iv of czca are required for proton/substrate-antiport, suggesting that they are probably involved in proton translocation  <cit> . a model for cation transport by an hme-rnd was recently proposed for the copper transporter cusa, in which the metal ion moves along a pathway of methionine residues, causing significant conformational changes in both the periplasmic and transmembrane domains  <cit> . these systems are proposed to promote the efflux of both cytoplasmic and periplasmic substrates, transporting of the substrate either via the rnd protein or in some cases via the membrane fusion protein with the aid of periplasmic metal chaperones  <cit> .

the best characterized rnd heavy metal efflux systems are mainly those from cupriavidus : czccba  from ralstonia metallidurans ch <dig>  <cit> ; cnrcba  from ralstonia eutropha <cit> ; ncccba  from alcaligenes xylosoxidans 31a  <cit> . however, other systems such as pseudomonas aeruginosa czr   <cit> ; and helicobacter pylori czn  were also studied  <cit> .

in order to better understand the role of the rnd efflux systems in the export of divalent cations in other proteobacteria, we investigated the role of two hme-rnd systems present in the alphaproteobacterium caulobacter crescentus. a previous bioinformatics analysis made by nies  through comparison of the genomes of  <dig> prokaryotes  with the genome of c. metallidurans, identified seven orfs encoding putative rnd proteins in c. crescentus cb <dig> of which two, cc <dig>  and cc <dig> , belong to the hme subgroup. previous works from our group  <cit>  identified that the czrcba locus is involved in resistance to cadmium and zinc and is induced by these cations, and other reports  <cit>  confirmed that this operon is induced by cadmium.

in this work, we have characterized both of these systems by constructing null mutant strains of the respective rnd-encoding genes and evaluating their resistance to cadmium, zinc, cobalt and nickel. we have also studied the pattern of gene expression of both operons in response to each metal. the results showed that the two proteins have different responses to metals both in resistance and in expression, suggesting distinct but somewhat overlapping roles for each protein. moreover, a phylogenetic analysis showed that these proteins belong to two distinct clusters, and that each group presents distinctive amino acid signatures.

RESULTS
comparative analysis of czr and ncz clusters
in an extensive analysis of putative heavy-metal exporters in microbial genomes, nies  <cit>  performed a blast search against the czca from r. metallidurans, confirming with multiple alignments and checking for the presence of specific signatures, to assign proteins into the rnd family. this global search identified seven rnd proteins in the genome of c. crescentus but only the proteins encoded by the ccna_ <dig> gene  and the ccna_ <dig> gene  contained the conserved motifs dfg-gad-ven, belonging to subgroup hme-rnd  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  these genes belong to two putative operons containing the czccba-related genes. in both czccba-related operons analyzed, no regulatory genes are found in the vicinity, in contrast to what was described for the cnr operon of r.metallidurans ch <dig> , czc of r. metallidurans and a. eutrophus  and ncc of a. xilosoxidans 31a   <cit> .

amino acid alignments showed that these paralogous share very low overall identity: ccna_ <dig> and ccna_ <dig> , 36% identity; ccna_ <dig> and ccna_ <dig> , 28% identity; and ccna_ <dig> and ccna_ <dig>  56% identity. moreover, the czr locus contains three additional genes encoding putative hypothetical proteins . orhtologues of ccna_ <dig> are found in this locus in phenylobacterium zucineum and in stenotrophomonas maltophilia, but no orthologs of ccna_ <dig> are found in this locus outside of the caulobacteraceae. the ccna_ <dig> is a putative atp-binding conserved protein that possesses a domain of unknown function. the low similarity among proteins encoded in these two loci suggests that they have diverged substantially, and that they may have acquired specialized roles in maintaining metal homeostasis.

identification of czr and ncz promoter regions
the putative orf ccna_ <dig> is separated from czrc by 57 bp, which raised questions as to the location of the promoter region for the czrcba operon. in order to identify the czrcba and nczcba promoter regions and perform gene expression analysis, transcriptional fusions to the lacz reporter gene in the prklacz <dig> vector were constructed. the fusions were constructed as folows: pnczc ; pczr  ; and pczr* . c. crescentus na <dig> carrying each transcriptional fusion were used in β-galactosidase activity assays . the results showed that pnczc/lacz fusion generated β-galactosidase activities of  <dig> and  <dig> miller units at exponential and stationary phase, respectively. pczr/lacz fusion generated β-galactosidase activities of  <dig>  and  <dig>  miller units; however, the pczr*/lacz construct generated only the same activity as the vector alone . the results indicate that the intergenic region between ccna_ <dig> and czrc genes lacks a promoter, and the czrcba operon expression is driven by a promoter upstream of ccna_ <dig>  in fact, a global analysis in search for c. crescentus metal-inducible promoters identified transcription start sites upstream of ccna_ <dig> and ccna_ <dig>  but none were detected upstream of czra, czrb or czrc <cit> . moreover, transcription from both these sites increased upon cadmium treatment, and a putative sequence motif  was identified in the region upstream of ccna_ <dig> that is conserved upstream of other cadmium-induced genes  <cit> .

to confirm that ccna_ <dig> belongs to the czrcba operon, an rt-pcr analysis was carried out using primers within the predicted coding regions of ccna_ <dig> and czrc . the results confirmed that there is a transcript encompassing ccna_ <dig> and czrc. since there are no gaps between czrc-czrb and czrb-czra , we conclude that at least these genes belong to putative operons. we cannot exclude the possibility that ccna_ <dig>  is co-transcribed with czrcba, although the distance between ccna_ <dig> and ccna_ <dig> is 63 bp. these results agree with the results reported previously that transposon insertions into either ccna_ <dig>  ccna_ <dig> or ccna_ <dig> caused a similar phenotype of increased sensitivity to cadmium  <cit> .

determination of gene expression in response to metals
to determine whether expression driven by pczr and pncz varied in response to different divalent cations, cultures of c. crescentus na <dig> harboring each transcriptional fusion were grown in pye medium up to an od600 =  <dig> , and were divided into equal aliquots. each aliquot was then added of the corresponding metal . β-galactosidase activity was determined at several time points after metal addition, and expression was evaluated relative to expression at the same points without metal addition . the results are shown in figure  <dig>  in the presence of cdcl <dig> the ncz operon was not induced at all times tested, in contrast to the czr operon, which is induced  <dig> -fold after 24 h. in the presence of zncl <dig> both operons showed a small induction at the 24 h time point: ncz  <dig> -fold, and czr  <dig> -fold. interestingly, in the presence of cocl <dig> and nicl <dig> the ncz operon demonstrated a rapid and greater induction at all times tested, reaching  <dig> -fold  and 3-fold . nevertheless, the czr operon showed modest induction at 24 h of exposure to metal .

these results suggest that these two rnd efflux systems have different roles in response to metal. the czr operon seems to be important mainly for the response to cadmium and zinc, whereas the ncz operon for the response to cobalt and nickel, since it was highly and quickly induced by these metals. a whole-genome transcriptional analysis upon heavy metal stresses  showed that the cluster ccna_02806-ccna_ <dig>  is highly induced in response to cadmium  <cit> . in our previous work, β-galactosidase assays using the lacz gene from the inserted transposon showed an induction of all genes by cadmium after 24 h  <cit> . the present work confirmed previous data for the czr regulation by zinc and cadmium, and further demonstrated that it is also induced by nickel and cobalt to a minor degree. this is also the first determination of the ncz operon induction by cobalt and nickel.

roles of each hme-rnd system in metal resistance
in order to study the effect of metal ions on bacterial growth, the parental strain na <dig>  as well as the single Δczra and Δncza and double ΔczraΔncza mutant strains were grown in pye medium with or without each individually added metal. all cultures started at the same optical density, and after 24 h growth of the strains was determined by measurement of the od <dig> nm . in comparison to the control , the na <dig> strain showed a small reduction in growth only in the presence of 40 μm cdcl <dig>  or 300 μm nicl <dig> , being only slightly sensitive to the other metal concentrations tested. the Δczra strain showed a severe reduction in growth in the presence of 40 μm cdcl <dig>  and 100 μm zncl <dig> , exhibiting an intermediate sensitivity to 100 μm cocl <dig>  and resistance to 300 μm nickel  comparable to the parental strain. on the other hand, Δncza had a more pronounced reduction in growth in 100 μm cocl <dig> , 40 μm cdcl <dig>  and 100 μm zncl <dig>  and showed a 48% reduction in growth with 300 μm nicl <dig>  however, it showed higher resistance to cdcl <dig> and zncl <dig> than the Δczra strain. as expected, the ΔczraΔncza strain had growth severely affected in the presence of all metals tested.

these data, taken together with the expression profile of each operon, indicate that czra is responsible mainly for cadmium and zinc efflux and has a secondary role in resistance to cobalt, whereas ncza is responsible mainly for nickel, and cobalt efflux with a secondary role in resistance to zinc and cadmium. to confirm the involvement of czra and ncza in metal resistance, complementation analyses were performed for each gene. the strains harbouring the empty vector or the vector with the complementing copy of each gene were grown in pye-kanamycin medium supplemented with  <dig> % xylose and addition of the metal tested for gene induction. figure 4b shows that complemented strains were able to grow similarly to na <dig> strain, whereas Δczra strain did not grow in cdcl <dig> and zncl <dig>  and the Δncza strain presented reduced growth in the presence of zncl <dig>  cocl <dig> and nicl <dig> 

the presence of two related transport systems in the genome suggests that they would improve the capacity of c. crescentus to resist to high concentration of metals, agreeing with the notion that they are complementary in function.

characterization and distribution among proteobacteria
the ccna_02805- <dig> cluster is located at the end of a 60-kb genomic island, identified in the annotation of the corresponding strain c. crescentus cb <dig> genome  <cit> , indicating that at least one of these c. crescentus rnd efflux system may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. this confirms a common association of these genes to mobile genetic elements, as discussed for other bacteria  <cit> .

to investigate the origins of these two c. crescentus hme-rnd proteins, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of czra and ncza, including in the analysis sequences from orthologs with at least 55% identity to either protein. the complete list of protein sequences used can be found in additional file 1: table s <dig>  this criterion was chosen given the fact that they both share this percentage of identity, but one must take into consideration that the analysis did not include all the sequences of members of the hme-rnd family in the databases, although we believe that most of the protein sequences belonging to group b have been included. the analysis showed that they group into two very distinct branches, along with orthologs from other proteobacterial groups . interestingly, the two branches present a remarkable difference in the number and variety of genera included. the czra orthologs group in a branch  composed mainly of members from the alphaproteobacteria, and at the base of this branch are sequences from parachlamidia and micavibrio. on the other hand, the larger a branch is composed of sequences from much more diverse genera, including members of the alpha, beta and gamma, and a single sequence from delta-proteobacteria. we also observed that the presence of multiple paralogs is a common trend among alphaproteobacteria, with many genera containing representatives from both groups. interestingly, hme-rnd proteins previously identified in the cupriavidus group also clustered separately, with the hme1-rnd proteins in the a branch and the hme2-rnd proteins emerging in a branch within the alphaproteobacteria in the b branch. this, together with the fact that the hme2-rnd genes from cupriavidus and other beta and gamma-proteobacteria are also found in plasmids  <cit> , clearly indicate the acquisition of these genes by lateral transfer.

we observed no correlation between the two phylogenetic groups a and b and the response to different types of metals of the rnd proteins already characterized. c. crescentus ncza, which is important for nickel and cobalt resistance, clustered in group a with c. metallidurans ch <dig> czca, which is involved in cd2+/zn2+/co2+ resistance  <cit> . similarly, c. crescentus czra, important for cd2+/zn2+ resistance, clustered in group b with cnra from c. metallidurans ch <dig>  which confers resistance to ni2+ and co2+, and with ncca from a. xylosoxidans 31a which confers ni2+/co2+/cd2+ resistance  <cit> . it must be noticed, however, that we observed two separate branches within group a , which include different genera of the gamma-proteobacteria and only one contains protein sequences from beta-proteobacteria . we cannot exclude the possibility that these two sub-groups could show some correlation with metal specificity, but more experimental work with representative proteins from each group is necessary to clarify that.

a previous search for domain signatures for the hme subfamilies identified the consensus sequence dfgx3dgax3ven as characteristic of hme <dig> and hme <dig>  <cit> . we used our alignment of c. crescentus czra and ncza orthologs in order to identify other possible motif signatures for each group . the analysis of the amino acid conservation profile within the czra and ncza orthologous groups showed five main different motif signatures  . in czra these motifs are: mi - xlxpxx, mii-ngf, miii -not conserved, miv- not conserved and mv- cf. in ncza these motifs are: mi - gy/fsple, mii - ygl, miii- pgq, miv - yw and mv- xl. a large loop contains the signature motif gxpgxqxdgx3tx2gx2l, whereas the small loop has motif ax4g. the complete analysis of the amino acid conservation for czra and ncza is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

in order to localize the identified signatures in the czra protein structure, we performed a homology modeling analysis utilizing the structure of e. coli cusa as model , since it is the only metal-transporting rnd protein structure so far available in the data bases. all of the motifs described above, with the exception of mv, are located in the periplasmic domain of czra structural model . mv is located in tm <dig> in czra , which in e. coli cusa suffers a significant conformational change when it binds cu+ or ag+, and was proposed to be involved in transmembrane signaling and in initiation of proton translocation across the membrane  <cit> . mi and mii are located in two close loops in the sub-domain pn <dig>  miii is located in the sub-domain dn and miv is located in the sub-domain-pc <dig> . the pc <dig> sub-domain in e. coli cusa was proposed to move, creating a cleft between pc <dig> and pc <dig> when cusa binds to cu+ or ag+ <cit> .

the most conspicuous difference between the czra and ncza groups is the length of the loop located in pn <dig>  called here large loop for czra and small loop for ncza. the periplasmic pn <dig> region is involved in the interaction between e. coli cusa and one molecule of the cusb dimer  <cit> . when we superimpose the czra model on the cusab <dig> complex structure , the results suggest that the large loop could affect the interaction between czra and the adaptor protein . the predicted adaptors for the c. crescentus hme-rnd systems, czrb and nczb, share no significant amino acid sequence identity with cusb  <cit> . nevertheless, most of the interface residues at the sub-domain dc in cusa involved in the interaction with one molecule of the cusb dimer are conserved in the czra and ncza orthologs, although the two residues located in pn <dig>  d <dig> and r <dig>  are not conserved in members of either group. we have to take into consideration the fact that the structures of the two partners have not been experimentally determined, and therefore one cannot infer how the interaction between the adaptors and the rnd proteins takes place.

the metal transport by the cusa efflux pump is mediated by a methionine channel built of four methionine pairs, m410-m <dig>  m486-m <dig>  m391-m <dig> and m755-m <dig> and a fifth cluster made up of three more essential methionines, m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  <cit> . in the czra-like and ncza-like ortholog families, methionine is only found at one of the positions that correspond to the methionines responsible for cu+/ag+ transport in cusa  <cit> . in proteins of both families these positions are occupied by other hydrophobic residues . moreover, of the three residues important for the proton-relay network in e. coli cusa, d <dig>  e <dig> and k <dig>  <cit> , only one is conserved in the czra and ncza orthologs . this observation raises the question about whether members of these families use methionine pairs/clusters to bind and export metal ions in a manner similar to that described for cusa. one possibility is that the methionine pairs are constituted by other methionines positioned differently in the c. crescentus hme-rnd structure. czra and ncza have  <dig> and  <dig> methionine residues, respectively. we therefore attempted to correlate these methionines in the czra structure model . there is no methionine pair close to the m271-m <dig> pair from cusa, but a possible m227-m <dig> pair exists close to the periplasmic region in the czra model. the three essential methionine cluster made up of m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> in cusa could be correlated with the m <dig> and m <dig> pair from czra. furthermore, m <dig> is in the same structural core than another pair, m141-m <dig>  suggesting that the three essential methionines could be replaced with two methionine pairs, m695-m <dig> and m141-m <dig>  the m1009-m <dig> and m403-m <dig> pairs in cusa could be correlated with m1020-m <dig> and with a cluster of three methionines  respectively, in the czra model. all of these methionines are located in the transmembrane domain of cusa/czra. nevertheless, there does not seem to be a methionine pair in czra that corresponds with m410-m <dig> in cusa. methionine pairs in the czra transmembrane region with sδ-sδ distances greater than 11 Å are m977-m <dig>  m1000-m <dig> and m472-m <dig>  all of these potential methionine pairs showing some spatial correlation with the cusa methionine pairs/clusters do not form an obvious channel in the czra model . this could be due to errors in the model which is based on the cusa structure with which it shares only 33% identity and 54% similarity. another possibility is that members of the czra family bind and export divalent ions in a different manner than members of cusa family transport cu+ and ag+ monovalent ions. this could be a reflection of a divergent evolutionary process in which members of cusa and czra evolved separately achieving different mechanisms and specificities for metal ions. however the degree of similarities and differences in the transport mechanisms of these two families remains to be established.

athe numbers correspond to the positions in c. crescentus czra and ncza proteins, respectively. the correspondence was determined by sequence alignment made using the phyre <dig> program  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we show a comparison of two hme-rnd family efflux systems , where the rnd proteins  have the motif dfg-gad-ven involved in the export of metal divalent cations. gene expression analyses, as well as metal resistance profile of mutant strains, showed that czra is involved mainly in response to cadmium and zinc with a secondary role in response to cobalt, whereas the ncza is involved mainly in response to nickel and cobalt, with a secondary role in response to cadmium and zinc. phylogenetic analysis of these two rnd proteins showed that they group into separate branches, and that czra-like proteins  are mainly found in the alphaproteobacteria, while ncza-like proteins  are more widespread among proteobacteria. signature motifs of each group were identified, but no correlation between phylogenetic distribution and the response to different types of metals was observed.
