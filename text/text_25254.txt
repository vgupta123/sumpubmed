BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  brücher described s. ruiz-lealii brüch. , as a new species from argentina endemic to southern mendoza province  <cit> . hawkes and hjerting  <cit>  considered that s. ruiz-lealii was a natural hybrid between s. kurtzianum bitter et wittm.  and s. chacoense bitter . in a recent report based on the analysis of morphological and molecular  data in natural populations of s. ruiz-lealii and accessions of the putative parental species from a germplasm bank, raimondi et al.  <cit>  suggested that s. ruiz-lealii might not be a recent natural hybrid between s. kurtzianum and s. chacoense but has probably originated by hybridization between s. chacoense and another taxon, or by divergence of s. chacoense. in this study, we provide further evidence of the hybrid origin of s. ruiz-lealii. raimondi et al.  <cit>  reported high morphological similarity between different accessions of s. ruiz-lealii, but also that some plants of this species had notable flower malformations. these malformations could be the result of stable mutations in genes that participate in flower development; however, since both normal and malformed flowers were simultaneously observed in different inflorescences of the same plant and, also, normal and malformed flowers were observed in the same inflorescence, this hypothesis would not be very likely unless variable expression and/or incomplete penetrance of the mutant gene involved are assumed. less irrevocable processes than mutations could be responsible for the abnormalities observed .

in potatoes, grun et al.  <cit>  detected deformed flowers in the progeny of a backcross  × s. chacoense. these deformed flowers either lacked anthers or these were present as rudiments. deformed corollas, slightly shortened styles, and female sterility were sometimes associated with these flowers. it was hypothesized that deformed flowers resulted from the interaction between a single recessive df gene present in certain s. chacoense plants and effective in the sensitive plasmon  of certain s. phureja plants. also, s. chacoense plants with the df allele for normal flower were described  <cit> . later, interactions between hypothetical nuclear genes and cytoplasmic factors, leading to alterations in male fertility and flower development in various species combinations, prompted evolutionary studies in solanum spp.  <cit> , and the first attempts to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying cytoplasmic male sterility  in this genus  <cit> . cms is a maternally inherited loss of male fertility based on flower male organ dysfunctions that range from anthers in a low position or reduction in pollen fertility  to a complete conversion of stamens into other floral organs  <cit> .

mitochondrial genes have been found to be associated with cms traits in most plant species so far examined  <cit> . comparison of chloroplast dna in several potato species suggests that the expression of cms in this group is not controlled by cpdna  <cit> , as also noted in other species like maize, rice, petunia, sunflower, wheat, brassica and phaseolus .

variations in dna methylation patterns can result in phenotypic instability  <cit> . in plant genomes, cytosine methylation of cpg and cpnpg nucleotides varies in frequency along the chromosome and regulates gene expression either at the gene level or, else, regionally, influencing entire chromosome regions  <cit> . ample evidence has been obtained to support this concept, and dna methylation is now recognized as a chief contributor to the stability of gene expression and chromatin structure. global analyses of genetic epigenetic and transcriptional polymorphisms in arabidopsis thaliana suggest a possible relationship between natural cg methylation variation and gene expression variation  <cit> . several studies have recently reported defects in flower development caused by heritable epigenetic alleles  associated with abnormal dna methylation. hypermethylated epialleles of agamous  <cit>  and superman  <cit> , which affect flower structure, and hypomethylated epialleles of fwa  <cit> , which delay flowering time, have been recovered from both mutagenized arabidopsis populations and dna hypomethylated lines such as ddm <dig>  met <dig>  and antisense-cytosine methyltransferase met <dig>  <cit> . natural plant epialleles affecting ecologically important traits, like floral symmetry and fruit ripening, have been described  <cit> . also, a connection between dna methylation and phenotypic instabilities was demonstrated using demethylating agents such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and 5'-azacytidine  <cit> .

the study of nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes as well as dna methylation variability is important for understanding the basis of phenotypic variation and microevolution in natural plant population and, also, for artificial selection in breeding programs. wild tuber-bearing solanum species constitute an important reservoir of genetic diversity and resistance/tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses for potato improvement  <cit> . however, epigenetic variation is often overlooked as a source of phenotypic variation for artificial selection. stokes et al.  <cit>  reported the molecular mechanism underlying a ddm <dig> induced pleiotropic defect, bal, that associates epigenetic regulation and plant pathogen defense responses. in the bal variant, overexpression of one gene in the cluster of nbs-lrr-class disease-resistance-genes stimulates the disease response pathway and causes dwarfing and elevated resistance. also, variation in the methylation status of the patatin gene among plants of synthetic hybrids between s. kurtzianum and s. tuberosum has been reported  <cit> . variation in epigenetic information encoded at the chromatin level rather than at the nucleotide sequence level is commonly thought to be transient and unlikely to underlie stable changes in phenotype. there is considerable evidence, however, that epigenetic changes, particularly those due to alterations in dna methylation, can be inherited through meiosis and mimic traditional mutations  <cit> .

the extent to which epiallelic variation is an important common contributor to phenotypic variation in natural plant populations and its consequences on fitness remain unknown. thus, the purposes of the present study were: a) to explore the possible origin of flower abnormalities in plants of a wild diploid potato species of hybrid origin, s. ruiz-lealii, and b) to evaluate the genetic and epigenetic variability in plants of a natural population. to this end, we examined nuclear and mitochondrial dna variability as revealed by analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphism  and restriction pattern markers, respectively, and the methylation status detected by the methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism  technique in plants with normal and plants with both normal and malformed flowers . neither the mtdna nor the ndna polymorphism explained the flower variability observed. the methylation polymorphism detected was higher than the ndna variability and allowed the grouping of genotypes according their flower phenotype. finally, we aimed at producing an abnormal flower phenotype from a plant with normal flower phenotype, by treatment with 5-azacyitidine .

RESULTS
flower morphology, pollen viability and cytology
the morphology of the leaves, tubers and stolons was normal in all plants studied, but normal and malformed flowers co-existed in each of five plants . pollen viability of normal flowers ranged from  <dig> to 80%; on the other hand, malformed flowers in those same plants bore no pollen. in figure  <dig>  the observed flower phenotypes are presented; the corolla shape of normal plants  <dig> , v <dig> and  <dig>  varied from rotate  to stellate . flower abnormalities found in different plants included: twisted anthers and style and twin flowers ; bilateral symmetry and dissected petals ; rudimentary stamens and petals ; homeotic changes like staminoid petals  and carpelloid stamens .

a no pollen viability was studied in this plant.

meiotic abnormalities were observed in the two plants, with abnormal flower phenotype, that were cytologically analyzed, such as heteromorphic bivalents , bridges and univalents  scattered outside the equatorial plate at metaphase i . many of the univalents observed at metaphase i remained as lagging chromosomes at anaphase i. at anaphase-telophase ii, 16% of the meiocytes observed had between  <dig> and  <dig> laggard chromosomes per cell .

mitochondrial genome analysis
mitochondrial dna of normal and abnormal plants was analyzed to assess whether the latter shared the same mitochondrial genotype. by examining five mitochondrial sequences through pcr amplification and digestion with restriction enzymes of amplified products, it was found that only genes rps <dig>  and rps <dig>  were informative ; the other sequences were not polymorphic among plants. based on the mitochondrial rflp patterns of rps14/ecori and rps10/hindiii, plants were grouped according to four different mitochondrial genotypes . based on this analysis, abnormal plant  <dig>  and normal plant  <dig>  had the mitochondrial a and d genotypes, respectively. the other plants shared the b or c genotypes.

a a, i, n, abnormal, intermediate and normal flower phenotype, respectively.

b  <dig> to  <dig> are codes for different band patterns.

inheritance of abnormal flower phenotype
only normal flowers were observed in five f <dig> interspecific hybrids obtained by crossing genotype  <dig> of s. ruiz-lealii with abnormal flower phenotype with a s. chacoense genotype of accession clalo  <dig> with normal flower phenotype. this could be explained by assuming that  the abnormal flower phenotype was the result of interactions between a recessive nuclear gene that, as an example and following grun's terminology  <cit> , could be designated as df , and a sensitive male sterile cytoplasmic factor, , and  the s. chacoense genotype carried a nuclear restorer gene, df.; therefore, the genotypic constitution of the f <dig> would be  df df. to confirm the presence of a sensitive  plasmon in s. ruiz-lealii and the restorer df gene in the genome of s. chacoense, a cross was performed between s. ruiz-lealii plant  <dig> and the f <dig>  under the previous hypothesis, the backcross progeny was expected to segregate  <dig>  df df :  <dig>  df df  . the backcross progeny did not fit the expected ratio; the segregation was distorted to the normal phenotype since  <dig> of the  <dig> evaluated plants exhibited the normal flower phenotype. of the eight remaining plants, five were classified as having abnormal and three as having intermediate flower phenotypes. because plants with intermediate phenotype presented normal anthers, they were grouped with the normal phenotypes for the x <dig> test. in this analysis, the probability of the null hypothesis for 1: <dig> ratio was p =  <dig> . the data presented here indicate that, with the number of plants analyzed, the segregation of the character abnormal flower in s. ruiz-lealii does not fit to a single mendelian gene inheritance. a larger number of progeny would be required to conclude in this respect. however, the difficulties experienced in the crossing work due to the presence of pre-zygotic barriers prevented us for increasing the number of examined plants.

aflp analysis
the aflp analysis was used to explore the genetic diversity in eight plants and to examine if there was correlation between flower phenotypes and the genetic variability that could be eventually detected. the analysis with eight pairs of primers produced  <dig> amplified fragments of which  <dig>  were monomorphic. the percentage of genetic variability among these plants varied between 1% and 15% . for example, two plants,  <dig> and  <dig>  shared  <dig> out of  <dig> fragments analyzed. in the cluster analysis, plant v <dig> separated from the other seven, which constituted a group with a genetic similarity of above 88% . in the phenetic analysis, in which plants with normal and abnormal flower phenotypes grouped together with moderate to high bootstrap support, no correlation between ndna variability and flower phenotype was detected.

methylation analysis
to test if the methylation patterns were correlated with flower abnormalities, the global methylation status of the same eight genotypes was analyzed. for msap analysis, six pairs of primers were used and a total of  <dig> fragments were analyzed . the msap bands were separated as methylation-sensitive and methylation-insensitive, to ensure that the scored epigenetic polymorphism was due to alterations in methylation and not to genetic changes at the ccgg sites.

one-hundred and seven fragments  did not show differences in digestibility in hpaii and mspi. the presence of fragments is an indication of non-methylated ccgg restriction sites whereas their absence could be due to either variations in the ccgg nucleotide sequences or their full methylation. anyway, these were considered as "methylation-insensitive polymorphisms" and were used, as the aflp analysis, to survey the genetic diversity among the studied plants. of the  <dig> fragments analyzed,  <dig>  were monomorphic. the genetic variability among the studied plants varied between 4% and 16% .

on the other hand,  <dig>  of the  <dig> msap fragments, which differed in presence/absence of ecori/hpaii and ecori/mspi patterns in at least one genotype, were considered as "methylation-sensitive polymorphisms" and were used to estimate the epigenetic variability.

thirty-three fragments  were monomorphic in the eight plants analyzed. twenty-five of them were present in the amplification from the mspi digest, but absent from the hpaii digest. the remaining fragments were present in the hpaii digest, but absent in the mspi digest.

the epigenetic variability detected by the "methylation-sensitive polymorphism" analysis was higher that the genetic variability detected by the aflp analysis and also by the "methylation insensitive polymorphism" analysis. the variability in the methylation of the ccgg sequences among the plants studied varied between 28% and 53% . in fact, genotype pairs such as 9- <dig> and 6– <dig> , with 96–99% and 96–98% of genetic similarity , had 72% and 61% of epigenetic similarity , respectively.

in the cluster analysis, based on the presence/absence of ecori/hpaii and ecori/mspi fragments, plants were arranged into two groups. one group contained plants with abnormal flower phenotypes with  <dig>  bootstrap value, whilst the second included plants with normal flower phenotype plus plant  <dig>  with intermediate flower phenotype, with  <dig>  bootstrap value .

in the analysis of the repetitive sequence 2d <dig>  plant  <dig> , which develops normal flowers as previously described, was included. using the enzyme hpaii, polymorphisms were observed for three fragments of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb . the smallest fragment was shared by all plants. the  <dig>  kb fragment was present in abnormal plant  <dig> , in the intermediate plant  <dig> and in all normal plants. however, the  <dig>  kb fragment was found exclusively in plants with some type of flower abnormality, since it was only seen in abnormal plants  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and in the intermediate plant  <dig>  digesting the samples  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , v <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  with the mspi enzyme , only a monomorphic fragment of  <dig>  kb was observed , showing that this fragment is originated from the digestion of a ccgg site present in the fragment of  <dig>  kb. in addition, the presence of the  <dig>  kb fragment in all the samples digested with mspi, confirms that the polymorphism observed with hpaii is epigenetic.

demethylation of a plant with normal flower phenotype
in the first season, three tubers of the normal plant  <dig>  were treated . the three plants derived from the treated tubers grew normally but one of them did not flower. the two plants that flowered,  <dig> t- <dig> and - <dig>  developed seven and nine inflorescences, respectively. six to  <dig> flowers per inflorescences were analyzed. only one flower of plant  <dig> t- <dig> was different from the flowers of the untreated control plant,  <dig> . in this flower, homeotic transformations  and one leaf joined to the receptacle were observed. petals, stamens and the gyneceum were normal. plant  <dig> t- <dig> produced only normal flowers. the treated plants exhibited no other morphological differences respect to the untreated control and tuberized normally.

in the second season, the experiment was repeated using both, tubers of the treated  <dig> t- <dig> plant and tubers of the control plant harvested in the previous season. one treated plant had flower phenotypes not observed in the control plants. abnormal and normal areas for flower phenotype appeared on the same plant and only six out of  <dig> inflorescences presented only normal flowers. in the ten remaining inflorescences, new flower phenotypes were observed respect to the control plants. the phenotypic novelties observed were: a) change in corolla color, with light purple in the abaxial side of the petals of some flowers ; b) flowers with dissected petals that resembled plants with abnormal flower phenotype ; c) flowers with twisted anthers ; d) organ fusion: fused sepals, fused petals, anther-style fusion, and petal-anther fusion ; e) flowers with twisted and bifurcated style ; f) flowers with longer sepals than the control . in the control plants, a total of  <dig> inflorescences were evaluated, which developed only normal flowers. in addition, the  <dig>  plant is maintained by vegetative reproduction and only normal flowers have been observed since  <dig>  to date.

to verify that the azac affected genome methylation in treated genotypes, the msap patterns were compared in treated and control plants. differences in banding patterns were observed : i) fragments present in the treated plant but absent in the control plant and ii) fragments present in the control plant but absent in the treated. these results indicate that the treated plant had altered methylation patterns respect to the control plant. the hypermethylations observed could be explained by the fact that the genome of solanum is able to respond to chemical treatment with azac.

discussion
in a previous work, genetic and epigenetic changes were reported in synthetic diploid hybrids obtained by artificial crosses between a haploid of s. tuberosum and the wild potato species s. kurtzianum  <cit> . those synthetic hybrids presented flower abnormalities such as dissected petals, atrophied anthers and homeotic transformations. in this study, we report similar flower abnormalities associated with epigenetic polymorphism in plants of s. ruiz-lealii. this is another wild diploid potato species of hybrid origin, as supported by the results of raimondi et al.  <cit>  and the low pollen fertility and meiotic abnormalities reported herein. these meiotic abnormalities are not related to the reported flower abnormalities because they were observed in both plants with normal and with abnormal flower phenotypes  <cit> .

the phenotypic flower alterations observed could have their origin in genomic instabilities, as a result of putative incompatibilities between nuclear genes, or between nuclear and cytoplasmic  genes. among the mechanisms that could account for the phenotypic defects in plants of this population, point mutations in specific genes can be ruled out, because normal and abnormal flowers were observed in the same plants at the same developmental stage. no correlation between flower phenotype and ndna variability was observed, as revealed by the aflp analysis, in which plants with normal and abnormal flower phenotypes were grouped together with high bootstrap values . similar results were obtained by analyzing the methylation insensitive polymorphism. however, it is still possible that these analyses did not detect nuclear mutation responsible for the flower abnormalities.

the variability in flower phenotypes could also be attributed to changes in gene expression. differences in gene expression can be established both, between individuals of the same progeny or population, and/or between different cells of the same tissue or organ. thus, the presence of normal and abnormal flowers in the same plant could be interpreted as quantitative variations in a character, which show incomplete penetrance and/or variable expressivity. reduced penetrance and variable expressivity are defined as a combination of genetic and environmental factors that influence the effects of particular genetic changes. most of these factors have not been identified, but it is possible that differences in penetrance and expressivity would turn out to be the result of epigenetic variability.

flower abnormalities could originate by epigenetic changes. arabidopsis mutants at the ddm <dig> and ddm <dig> loci have a reduced overall level of cytosine methylation and display a number of developmental defects  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing an antisense cytosine methyltransferase rna also exhibit abnormalities including a number of flower defects resembling the phenotypes of known flower homeotic mutants  <cit> . two different flower regulatory genes, superman and agamous have been found to be hypermethylated in the antisense-met <dig> arabidopsis plants  <cit> . these experiments suggest a direct cause and effect relation between dna methylation and proper regulation of developmentally important genes. our results of the msap analysis indicate that plants with abnormal flower phenotype had a similar global status of cytosine methylation, which was different from the status of the plants with normal flower phenotype. this differential methylation status between normal and abnormal phenotypes was confirmed by studying the methylation of a pericentromeric repetitive sequence, where we found that plants with  abnormal flowers shared one epiallele absent in plants with normal flowers. in order to obtain more data about the participation of dna methylation in the origin of flower abnormalities, we reproduced the flower abnormalities observed in nature by altering chemically the methylation patterns of a plant with normal flower phenotype. in this way, a connection between dna methylation and flower phenotype is strongly suggested by the data. altogether, these results are consistent with the epigenetic basis of flower abnormalities in the hybrid s. ruiz-lealii.

differences in methylation levels can lead to differences in gene expression, and can include variation in transcriptional levels that confer phenotypic effects  <cit> . remodeling of dna methylation and phenotypic and transcriptional changes have been reported in unstable genomes, as in synthetic arabidopsis allotetraploids  <cit> . in a recent study, we showed that interspecific solanum hybrids and their bc1progenies presented changes in methylation patterns  <cit> . in addition we observed flower abnormalities in those hybrids similar to the ones in s. ruiz-lealii. also, in another natural diploid hybrid, s. × rechei, we observed the same type of abnormalities . changes in dna methylation induced by hybridization and/or polyploidization were reported in brassica, triticum, oryza and spartina  <cit> . our results indicate that these observations could be extended to the tuber-bearing solanum, in which case, interspecific hybridization among potato species triggers genetic and epigenetic changes that induce phenotypic alterations, affecting principally the regulation of flower development. this raises the possibility that dna methylation may normally play a role in the regulation of flower development genes in interspecific hybrids, and that the differences in methylation can cause misregulation of this system.

however, we cannot rule out the possibility of cytoplasmic-nuclear interactions. homeotic-like flower morphologies in plants with cytoplasmic male sterility  are maternally inherited and associated with rearrangements in the mitochondrial dna  <cit> . based on our analysis of the mitochondrial sequences, we could not detect any pattern shared exclusively by plants with abnormal flower phenotypes, which could have been linked to the presence of a mutation in the mtdna responsible for cms. it is also possible that normal and abnormal plants sharing the same mitochondrion could have different nuclear complements. cytoplasmic homeosis affects flower morphology via altering the expression of homeotic genes . however, detailed mechanisms of cytoplasmic homeosis are still unclear. our hypothesis to integrate flower development with a particular mtdna composition is that mitochondrial dysfunction could induce epigenetic changes affecting the transcriptional activity of homeotic genes. bereterbide et al.  <cit>  studied the fusion of the stamens with the pistil in nicotiana tabacum with the cytoplasm of n. repanda. they showed that the phenotype was partially restored by ectopic expression of the arabidopsis superman gene and that the expression of the putative tobacco superman gene was significantly lower in an alloplasmic male sterile line compared with the male fertile tobacco line. these authors discussed that the impairment in gene expression might result from an epigenetic modification of ntsup sequence.

the plants used in our study are genetically closed as revealed by the aflp analysis and confirmed by the methylation insensitive polymorphism analysis. on the other hand, we report an important level of natural variation in methylation profiles of anonymous ccgg restriction sites. similarly, keyte et al.  <cit>  exploring the methylation polymorphism at ccgg sites in  <dig> accessions of cotton found a high level of methylation polymorphism that exceeded the polymorphism obtained with rflp markers. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work where the global methylation variability is evaluated in a tuber-bearing species of the genus solanum. interestingly, the epigenetic variability found in the natural plant population used in this study would be associated with a particular phenotype with evolutionary significance. there is an important reproductive aspect to be considered that is strongly related to flower abnormalities and the role in sexual isolation. bumblebees, the only insects that pollinate tuber-bearing solanum species, do no visit plants with aberrant flowers  <cit>  that are, consequently, isolated from the breeding point of view. comparing genetic and epigenetic  variability, we found that plants that presented less than 4% of genetic variability  had a divergence in the methylation patterns of about 28%. this suggests that related plants may begin to differentiate first in their methylation patterns. also, we observed a wide difference between genetic and epigenetic variability in plants  <dig>  and  <dig>  the flower morphology of these plants was also different. plant  <dig> had rotate normal flowers and some flowers with the abnormalities described. on the other hand, plant  <dig>  presented only normal stellate flowers, instead of rotate. the methylation variability among these genetically related genotypes could explain the phenotype differences observed.

in a similar study, cervera et al.  <cit>  found 24–34% of differences in the methylation of the ccgg sites among different ecotypes of arabidopsis thaliana. however they found a minimal variation  when comparing the methylation patterns among plants of the same ecotype. in our study, we can consider that the plants of s. ruiz-lealii examined belong to the same ecotype, since they were collected in the same area and the morphology of the plants was similar except for the flower abnormalities described  <cit> . in contrast to the results with arabidopsis, we found 53% of intra-ecotype methylation changes. this source of variability, unexplored in the genus solanum, could indicate higher plasticity in the solanum versus the arabidopsis genome. in this sense, salmon et al.  <cit>  to explain the phenotypic variability reported in brassica species proposed that the high methylation level and polymorphism founded in this species could be related with the high structural genome plasticity.

CONCLUSIONS
this work contributes to extend previous observations of dna methylation changes  <cit>  induced by hybridization and/or polyploidization to species of tuber-bearing solanum. analyzing the methylation status of the natural homoploid hybrid solanum ruiz-lealii by msap technique and southern blot, we found association between methylation patterns and abnormal flower phenotypes. chemical demethylation of a normal plant reproduced the abnormal phenotypes observed in hybrid plants with similar methylation patterns. furthermore, this analysis showed that the epigenetic variability was higher than the genetic variability measured by aflp analysis. to assess the importance of the epigenetic variation in the microevolutionary process of s. ruiz-lealii, the inheritance and stability of the epialleles should be established. the association between flower abnormalities and epigenetic variation found in the natural population of s. ruiz-lealii studied is important for potato taxonomists for two reasons. the first is the origin of new morphological types better explained by epigenetic variability . the second reason relates to the origin of new species by interspecific hybridization. flower abnormalities can act as an isolating mechanism influencing the mating among solanum species and their hybrids. because methylation changes are potentially reversible and can regulate the degree of gene expression, after the hybrids are stabilized through several generations of clonal propagation, the fertility of the incipient species could be restored.
