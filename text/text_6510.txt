BACKGROUND
leptospirosis in dogs may manifest with a wide range of symptoms, from fever to liver and kidney failure, jaundice and bleeding. it is a widespread life-threatening disease with zoonotic potential, particularly in tropical areas  <cit> , where characteristics such as climate, topography and also regularity of veterinary assistance affect the prevalence of the disease  <cit> .

the early diagnosis becomes a priority for allowing therapeutic incursions and more effective control measures  <cit> . however, the most employed serological method for the diagnosis of leptospirosis – the microscopic agglutination test  - may not present adequate sensitivity, particularly in detecting early disease. additionally, it requires specific laboratory facilities and is too laborious, offering risk to the operator  <cit> . the mat detects agglutinating antibodies and paired serum samples with an interval of at least 10 days are needed to diagnose acute infection  <cit> . due to these limitations, recent studies have applied proteomic approaches in order to identify novel protein antigens for the development of alternative diagnostic tests  <cit> . currently, a variety of alternative methods based on recombinant proteins are under development, such as elisas and immunoblotting assays, and have shown encouraging results  <cit> .

several reported serodiagnostic assays target the leptospiral immunoglobulin-like  proteins as antigen  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the lig genes are highly conserved among different leptospiral species and present exclusively among pathogenic leptospires  <cit> . besides, the lig proteins are exposed on the surface of the bacterium and have been identified not only as diagnostic markers during early leptospirosis but also as potential candidates for vaccine development  <cit> . additionally, lipl <dig> is also a protein with remarkable importance in this context, since it is the most abundant outer membrane lipoprotein of leptospires and seems to be highly immunogenic  <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to identify immunodominant proteins of leptospires that are recognized by sera from healthy or diseased dogs, which can be employed in the development of a novel diagnostic test for canine leptospirosis.

RESULTS
according to the mat results, reactions against members of serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae  were the most common, representing  <dig> %  of all seroreactive samples. seroreactivity against serogroups pomona  and grippotyphosa  were also detected.

the purified recombinant proteins used for printing the mapia strips were analyzed by sds page  <dig> % and showed high homogeneity . the mapia densitometry results showed that, in general, group n <dig>  had lower igm background against the recombinant proteins than groups n <dig>  and n <dig>  and group p <dig>  had a stronger igm reactivity . the reactivity detected for group p <dig>  against ligb  l. kirschneri gryppotyphosa, ligb  l. interrogans canicola and lipl <dig> l. interrogans copenhageni were the most intense, with a higher median reactivity when compared to the control groups .figure  <dig>

using a cut-off of  <dig>  standard deviations above the average reactivity of the control samples, we were able to establish sensitivity and specificity values for each of the recombinant proteins studied when comparing the seropositive group  with each of the control groups . the results are summarized in table  <dig>  the specificity did not vary significantly when analyzing the different control groups. conversely, sensitivity varied considerably, showing lower values when group n <dig>  was the considered group. even though sensitivity is strictly related to the number of true positive samples, that is, reactivity among the reference samples in group p <dig>  the use of different control groups lead to different cut-offs, which may ultimately influence the sensitivity. indeed, background reactivity was higher in group n <dig> , increasing the cut-off value compared to groups n <dig> and n <dig> . in general, lig recombinant proteins  l. interrogans canicola, lig  l. kirschneri gryppotyphosa and lipl 32 l. interrogans copenhageni provided best sensitivity rates, for all control groups, except for group n <dig>  in which lig  l. interrogans copenhageni overpassed lipl <dig> table  <dig>

in order to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the recombinant proteins, individual antigen roc curves were generated and the corresponding auc was determined. antigens were then ranked by decreasing auc and multiple antigens roc curves were generated. figure 3a shows the individual roc curves for each of the recombinant proteins when we compared the seropositive dogs  against all the other groups combined as a single group . the auc values are shown in table  <dig>  lipl <dig> l. interrogans copenhageni provided best accuracy , followed by ligb  l. kirschneri gryppotyphosa  and ligb  l. interrogans canicola . furthermore, when group p <dig> was compared to groups n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> separately, the same antigens showed best performance. the combination of those three antigens improved the diagnostic accuracy when considering all control samples in a single group  and also when group p <dig> was compared to group n <dig> . using group n <dig> as the control group, lipl <dig> and ligb  l. kirschneri gryppotyphosa provided the best performance. when we consider group n <dig>  as control, however, the addition of extra antigens did not impact the diagnostic performance of lipl <dig> .figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study we used three different groups of seronegative samples. group n <dig> was a very well-defined group, with reliable information regarding shelter, immunization and veterinary assistance. although rio de janeiro, as other tropical cities, is an endemic city for leptospirosis and it is not possible to exclude the possibility of previous contact of those dogs with leptospires, those animals present a low epidemiological risk of infection due to smaller chances of direct or indirect contact with rodents. accordingly, higher sensitivity and specificity rates were obtained when the seropositive group p <dig> was compared against group n <dig>  it is also interesting to highlight that all animals in group n <dig> had been vaccinated within 1 year before sample collection and, therefore, the antigens with high diagnostic performance identified when group n <dig> was used as control were actually able to differentiate between a current acute leptospirosis case and a vaccinated non-diseased dog.

conversely, animals from group n <dig>  presented the lower accuracy results. information regarding the epidemiological status of those animals was very scarce, as well as data about previous diseases or immunizations history. therefore, those dogs may have been exposed to many variables, and possible biases cannot be excluded. nevertheless, it is important to note that in the daily practice information may not be available for the practitioner when a decision regarding the diagnostic test must be taken. in that situation, results of group n <dig> represent a non-ideal but very common scenario in veterinary practice, justifying its inclusion in the present study.

noteworthy that in all comparative prospectuses lipl <dig> presented good results and discriminatory abilities. although its potential for diagnosis tests is still controversial, the protein is known to be an immunodominant antigen in leptospirosis, particularly for the acute syndrome of the disease in human beings  <cit> . it has been reported that igm antibodies specific to the c-terminal region of lipl <dig> can be detected during the acute infection, so that lipl <dig> could be effectively used as a diagnostic marker  <cit> . furthermore, it has been successfully employed as an amplification target in molecular diagnosis  in human and animal samples, with excellent specificity, since it is present exclusively in pathogenic leptospires  <cit> .

lipl <dig> alone or associated to ligb  of l. interrogans canicola and/or l. kirschneri gryppotyphosa showed the best discriminatory potential. the fragment ligb  of l. interrogans canicola and/or l. kirschneri gryppotyphosa is encoded by a genetic region  that shares 100% identity with liga. though liga is present only in l. interrogans and l. kirschneri, ligb has been detected in all pathogenic leptospira species  <cit> . furthermore, the fragment ligb  has been described as a highly sensitive marker for leptospirosis in humans, particularly in the first week of the course of infection  <cit> .

our findings for canine leptospirosis are in contrast with recent studies conducted in human beings, in which the ligb  and liga  proteins were the basis of a novel rapid test and showed promising results  <cit> . here, we show that those fragments are not as strongly antigenic in dogs.

the predominance of seroreactivity against serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae detected by mat was expected and agrees with previous studies conducted with clinically suspect brazilian dogs  <cit> . as a consequence, even though it was not the original purpose of this study, the mapia analysis performed here took into account the incidental syndrome of canine leptospirosis. therefore, it is important to highlight that our results may not represent the chronic/subclinical disease that is determined by the host-adapted serovar canicola. it is interesting, though, the fact that ligb  of l. kirschneri gryppotyphosa and l. interrogans canicola presented better results than ligb  l. interrogans copenhageni. although theoretically a protein obtained from copenhageni strains should be more useful for detecting dogs infected by icterohaemorraghiae serogroup, it was not observed in the current study. noteworthy that ligb obtained from l. kirschneri has a 91% identity with respect to l. interrogans serovar copenhageni  <cit> , and the region between amino acids 131-649aa of ligb fragment corresponding to ligb domains 2– <dig> has an even higher identity , which could possibly explain the obtained results.

CONCLUSIONS
mapia identified important immunodominant antigens in canine leptospirosis. lipl <dig> presented the most consistent results in all analysis, and may represent a major candidate for diagnostic tests. alternatively, ligb  of l. interrogans canicola and l. kirschneri gryppotyphosa may increase accuracy when present in a combined antigenic formula for detecting leptospirosis in dogs.
