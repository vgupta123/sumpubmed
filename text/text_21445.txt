BACKGROUND
litchi , one of the most important tropical and subtropical plants in the sapindaceae family was originated in china, where it has been cultivated for more than  <dig>  years  <cit> . the sapindaceae is a relatively large family, including at least  <dig> genera and  <dig>  species, which are widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical areas. being the most widely cultivated fruit crop in this family, litchi becomes a significant contribution to the lives and economies of millions of people in southeast asia. in  <dig>  litchi production in china was  <dig> , <dig> tons from  <dig>  ha  <cit> , providing major employment for the local people. the desirable characteristics of litchi fruit, such as a bright colour, exotic aroma, excellent flavour and rich nutrients, make it very attractive and popular in the international markets  <cit> . despite the economic and commercial importance of litchi, there have been few genomic studies on this crop. this is confirmed by the very few number of litchi gene sequences available in public databases, with only  <dig> nucleotide sequences available in the ncbi genbank as of  <dig> augest  <dig> . the lack of sequence data for the species of the sapindaceae family has greatly hindered their research at the molecular level.

next generation sequencing technology , such as high-throughput paired-end rna sequencing  and digital transcript abundancetag profiling, has greatly facilitated investigation of the functional complexity of transcriptomes for non-model organisms without a reference genome  <cit> . de novo assembly of a transcriptome from rna-seq produces a genome-scale transcription map that contains both the transcriptional structure and expression level for each gene.

even though rna-seq and dta have not yet been performed with the members of the sapindaceae family, they have been widely applied to many other fruit crops for transcriptome analysis, gene discovery and molecular marker development. for examples: more than  <dig> million reads were generated and  <dig>  unigenes were expressed in a stage-specific manner in three different developmental stages of berries in vitis vinifera <cit> ;  <dig>  transcript assemblies were obtained and about  <dig> simple sequence repeat markers were identified in pomegranate   <cit> ;  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of  <dig> bp were de novo assembled and more than  <dig>  unigenes were differentially expressed in three ripening stages in chinese bayberry   <cit> . in siraitia grosvenorii, rna-seq was combined with dta to understand mogroside biosynthesis. about  <dig> million high-quality reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes, in which  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> and  <dig> udp-glucosyltransferase unigenes were identified, and seven and five of these unigenes, respectively, were found to be involved in mogroside biosynthesis  <cit> .

it is well known that litchi trees generally produce many more female flowers than necessary  <cit> . most of the inevitable massive abscission of flowers and fruitlet occurs after pollination, leading to a low fruit set  <cit> . to date, rather than investigating at the molecular level, most biological studies on abscission in litchi have been carried out on the physiological level related to nutrients and hormones  <cit> .

during early fruit development, active sinks such as the growing shoots and fruit compete for limited carbohydrate and nutrient resources  <cit> . artificial shading over the whole canopy is a practical research approach used to induce fruit abscission and investigate its various underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms. shading during this period not only rapidly decreases photosynthesis, reducing the availability of assimilates but further aggravates the competition among these sinks  <cit> . a decrease in the relative growth rates of fruit is apparent within  <dig> days after shading  <cit> . fruit abscission begins at  <dig> to  <dig> days after shading and peaks at  <dig> days  <cit> . therefore, reduction in fruit growth is an earlier response to shading, while fruit abscission is the final effect of shading on fruit. severe fruitlet abscission usually leads to a very low yield and causes significant economic losses for farmers.

during the last few years, several methods have been used to study the transcriptional regulation of fruit abscission, including suppression subtractive hybridization and cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism, as well as microarrays. with suppression subtractive hybridization technology, a total of  <dig> expressed sequence tags were obtained and only  <dig> unigenes were found in the cdna library of fruitlet, in apples , after shading  <cit> . cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism identified  <dig> differentially expressed clones isolated from the seeds, cortices and peduncles of abscising fruitlet and non-abscising fruitlet populations <cit> . because of the limited throughput and high false-positive rate of the two methods mentioned above, microarray was applied to several species to obtain large-scale transcriptional regulation information during organ abscission in apples  <cit> , citrus   <cit>  and tomato   <cit> . recently, gil-amado and gomez-jimenez  <cit>  compared the olive fruit abscission zone transcriptomes at two different stages  using the rna-seq technique;  <dig> mb of sequences  were obtained and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were identified from these two samples. of these  <dig>  differentially expressed genes,  <dig>  were up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated at the abscission stage in the fruit abscission zone  <cit> .

rna-seq is a fast and comprehensive approach for direct sequencing at an extraordinary depth, while dta is based on sequencing serial analysis of gene- expression libraries and generates a digital output proportional to the number of transcripts per mrna  <cit> . over the last few years, studies in marine fish   <cit> , whitefly   <cit>  and siraitia grosvenorii <cit>  have demonstrated that the combination of these two technologies is very suitable for studying transcriptome profiles and provides a good understanding of the complexity of gene expression, regulation and networks. however, none of the techniques mentioned above have been applied in litchi to date, simply because of the lack of genomic sequence information. in this study, the litchi fruit transcriptome was first de novo assembled and annotated using rna-seq and various computation tools, following which large-scale differentially expressed transcripts in response to shading were explored using dta. this information will be very helpful for improving the functional genomics studies in litchi and furthering our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind shade-induced fruit abscission in fruit trees.

RESULTS
paired-end sequencing and de novo assembly
a pooled cdna sample representing diverse tissues and developmental stages of litchi fruit was prepared and sequenced with illumina paired-end sequencing. after a stringent quality check and data cleaning,  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads with a total of  <dig> , <dig>  bp were obtained and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes . the quality of the reads was assessed using the base-calling quality scores from the illumina’s base-caller bustard. in addition,  <dig> % of the clean reads had phred-like quality scores at the q <dig> level . using the soapdenovo software , a total of  <dig>  contigs  with an average length of  <dig> bp,  <dig>  scaffolds  with an average length of  <dig> bp, and  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of  <dig> bp were assembled, respectively . the length distributions of the contigs, scaffolds and unigenes are listed in additional file  <dig>  taken unigenes as an example, the lengths of unigenes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  unigenes  were between  <dig> and  <dig> bp;  <dig>  unigenes  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp; and  <dig>  unigenes  were larger than  <dig>  bp . in addition,  <dig>  scaffolds  and  <dig>  unigenes  showed no gaps .

n <dig> = median length of all non-redundant sequences.

functional annotation and classification
for annotation, the assembled unigenes were first compared against the ncbi non-redundant  and the swiss-prot protein databases using blastx analysis with a cut-off e-value of 10– <dig>  the results indicated that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  unigenes  could be annotated based on sequences in the nr database, while  <dig>  unigenes  were aligned to known proteins in the swiss-prot database . to further analyze the blast results, the e-value and similarity distributions were calculated . statistical analysis of the top hits in the nr database showed that  <dig> % of the mapped sequences had significant homology , and almost  <dig> % of the sequences had alignment identities greater than 80% . as expected, a comparable pattern of e-value and similarity distribution of the top blast hits was found in the swiss-prot database. figure 1b and 1d show that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the mapped sequences, respectively, had significant homologies and similarities higher than 80% in the swiss-prot database.

* proportion of the  <dig>  assembled unigenes.

on the basis of nr annotation, gene ontology  analysis was performed. of the  <dig>  annotated unigenes,  <dig>  sequences were assigned with one or more go terms . these  <dig>  unigenes were categorized into  <dig> go functional groups , which are distributed under the three main categories: molecular function , biological process  and cellular components  . within the molecular function category, genes encoding binding proteins  and proteins related to catalytic activity  were the most enriched. proteins related to metabolic processes  and cellular processes  were enriched in the biological process category. under the cellular components category, the cell , cell part  and organelle  were the most highly represented go terms.

in addition to go analysis, clusters of orthologous groups  analysis was used to further evaluate the function of our assembled unigenes. in total, out of  <dig>  nr hits,  <dig>  hits were aligned with the  <dig> cog classifications . in the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for ‘general function prediction only’  represented the largest group, followed by ‘transcription’  and ‘replication, recombination and repair’ . only a small portion of the unigenes were assigned to ‘nuclear structure’  or ‘cell motility’ . it is worth noting that a large number of genes were assigned to ‘signal transduction mechanisms’ , ‘carbohydrate transport and metabolism’  and ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’  .

to explore the pathways in which these annotated genes were involved, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis with an e-value cut-off less than 10- <dig> was also conducted. a total of  <dig>   annotated unigenes had significant matches with  <dig>  hits in the kegg database and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . among them, about  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to metabolic pathways. as shown in figure 3a,  <dig>  unigenes were clustered into carbohydrate metabolism, followed by enzyme families , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites  and amino acid metabolism , and so on. carbohydrate metabolism can be further classified into  <dig> subcategories ; most of which were mapped to pathways of starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, or galactose metabolism.

evaluation of the dta library and sequencing
to explore the differentially expressed genes induced by shading treatment, dta profiling was conducted for both shaded and non-shaded samples. after data cleaning, a total of  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million high-quality tags, representing  <dig>  and  <dig>  tag entities with unique nucleotide sequences  were generated from shaded and non-shaded libraries respectively. among these,  <dig>  and  <dig>  distinct tags identified in  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes, respectively, were unambiguously mapped to the litchi reference transcriptome database obtained in this study . the distribution of total tags and distinct tags throughout different tag abundance categories showed significantly similar patterns in these two libraries .

differentially expressed unigenes between shaded and non-shaded libraries
to reveal the molecular events behind the dta profiles, we analyzed the differentially expressed unigenes between shaded and non-shaded libraries. in our study, more than 99% of the distinct tag entities showed the expression within a five-fold change between the two libraries . to identify candidate unigenes that are regulated in response to shading, an algorithm developed by audic and claverie  <cit>  was used to compare their transcript abundance profiles. a total of  <dig>  regulated tag entities, which were mapped to  <dig>  unigenes, showed significant differential expression ; among these,  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were up- and down-regulated, respectively . however, only  <dig> unigenes were functionally annotated with go terms  and  <dig> unigenes were identified in the kegg pathway annotation . interestingly, approximately  <dig> % of the unigenes with known function fell into the categories related to carbohydrate metabolism, proteolysis and cell death, hormone response, amino acid metabolism or photosynthesis , suggesting that these pathways or processes might respond to the shading signal.

since go categories and kegg annotation are too general to provide detailed information on the biological mechanisms, additional annotation  was further conducted on all of  <dig>  unigenes with differential expression patterns. these unigenes were divided into  <dig> groups . ten groups  accounted for only about 28% of the differential unigenes; one unknown group consisted of about 37% of the significant unigenes, and the remaining three groups  took up approximately the other 35% of the unigenes.

effects of shading on fruitlet abscission and expression of selected differentially regulated genes between two tda libraries
to uncover the roles of the differentially expressed unigenes mentioned above, the effects of shading on fruitlet abscission and the expression of randomly selected differentially regulated genes between two dta libraries were further studied. the cumulative fruit abscission rates  were calculated and compared among the shaded and non-shaded trees. the cfars showed similar trends , which gradually increased during the first  <dig> days. four days after treatment, the cfar in shade-treated fruits was significantly higher than that in the non-shaded controls. consequently,  <dig> % of the fruit on the shaded trees dropped  <dig> days after treatment, compared with a  <dig> % loss among controls, indicating that shading treatment significantly intensified fruitlet drop.

fourteen genes were randomly selected in order to compare their expression patterns by quantitative real-time pcr  with fruitlet abscission patterns during shading treatment . four genes, encoding β-fructofuranosidase , endo-β- <dig> -glucosidase , invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor  and atp citrate lyase , were related to carbohydrate metabolism, while another four genes, encoding chitinase , mannose/ glucose-specific lectin , thioredoxin-like  <dig>  and peroxidase  <dig> , were involved in pathogen defence and oxidation-reduction reaction. the remaining five genes, encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> , asparagine synthase , indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase , ll-diaminopimelate aminotransferase  and s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase , were involved in ubiquitination, nitrogen metabolism, hormone metabolism, amino acid metabolism and polyamine synthesis respectively. and lastly, the myb family transcription factor  belongs to the transcription factors directly involved in gene expression control. as listed in additional file  <dig>  nine and five unigenes were up- and down-regulated respectively. the qrt-pcr results showed a similar change trend for all tested unigenes in the shaded and non-shaded fruits . the mrna transcript abundance of eight unigenes  constantly increased after treatment, with significantly higher expression compared to the non-shaded control, except for four unigenes  at  <dig> days after treatment. three unigenes  exhibited consistently significant down-regulated expression under shaded treatment, which represented a trend opposite to the fruitlet drop patterns from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after shading. the previously mentioned eleven unigenes might be associated with fruitlet abscission induced by shading. the remaining three unigenes  might not be directly related to fruit shedding, as indicated by their irregular expression patterns between shaded and non-shaded trees throughout the whole experiment.

discussion
first litchi fruit reference transcriptome generated by rna-seq
computer-based de novo assembly tools  have been developed in conjunction with massively parallel sequencing and their usefulness in transcriptome assembly has been demonstrated in previous studies. garg et al. found that transcriptome assembly with velvet followed by oases program was better than that with other programs based on various assessment parameters   <cit> . it was also noted that oases was the most appropriate program for de novo assembly of the wheat  transcriptome, when compared with trans-abyss and trinity  <cit> .

only the soapdenovo program was used for sequence assembly in the current study since many studies have demonstrated that soapdenovo is a powerful tool for annotating transcriptomes for plant species across taxa, including sweet potato   <cit> , chinese bayberry   <cit> , siraitia grosvenorii <cit> , taxus mairei <cit> , hevea brasiliensis <cit> , salvia miltiorrhiza <cit> , citrus  <cit> , momordica cochinchinensis <cit>  and peanut   <cit> . in this study, a total of  <dig> , <dig>  bp were sequenced and assembled into a reference transcriptome of litchi fruit, which is also the first library in the sapindaceae family to be reported. using the soapdenovo software, we generated a total of  <dig>  unigenes , whose average length  was longer than that documented in other studies using similar technology and different research organisms, such as momordica cochinchinensis   <cit> , hevea brasiliensis   <cit> , sweet potato   <cit> , salvia miltiorrhiza   <cit>  and chinese bayberry   <cit> . our results showed that more than 59% of unigenes were matched with functional annotations in the nr database, which is comparable with results from other studies using the same approach . we found that more unigenes are involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathways than in other carbohydrate metabolism pathways that are active in the fruit. these results are consistent with the findings in siraitia grosvenorii <cit> , chinese bayberry  <cit>  and date palm   <cit> . taken together, the litchi fruit reference transcriptome assembled in this study is comprehensive, accurate and useful for future genetic research of litchi fruit.

discovery of more than  <dig>  unigenes differentially regulated in fruit in response to shading using the dta method
fruit is an organ that depends mainly on nutrition imported from elsewhere in the plant, especially photosynthates from leaves  <cit> . shading during early fruit development decreases fruit growth and induces fruit abscission by reducing the availability of assimilates  <cit> . although many researchers have made great efforts to elucidate the mechanisms of shading effects on fruit growth and abscission, the symptomatic molecular events related to this treatment are still largely unknown  <cit> . by employing the method of suppression subtractive hybridization, zhou et al. isolated, from apple fruitlet,  <dig> shade-response unigenes belonging to eight functional categories  <cit> . through the use of apple oligonucleotide microarray,  <dig>  selected genes belonging to  <dig> functional categories, from shade-treated fruit abscission zone, were discovered  <cit> . in this study, we discovered that the expression of  <dig>  unigenes, which fell into  <dig> groups, was impacted by shading.

a reduction in light intensity is thought to be the most direct effect of shading. it has been hypothesized that photosynthetic rates are significantly altered by different levels of shading  <cit> . zhu et al. found that about 6% of shade-response genes are related to photosynthesis and more than 90% of these genes are repressed in the apple fruit abscission zone  <cit> . in the current study, about 2% of litchi unigenes induced by shading were found to be related to photosynthesis, and only 28% of the genes documented were repressed. the repressed unigenes were mainly involved in light harvesting and electron transport for photosystem i, while the remaining up-regulated unigenes included genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, light harvesting and electron transport for photosystem ii, and the chlorophyll dna binding genes. fruit setting and development are highly dependent on the carbohydrate supply. in response to shading,  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes encode enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolisms, such as glycosidases, hydrolases, and transferases, most were up-regulated, which is in agreement with the findings in apples  <cit> . the up-regulated expression of these genes is likely a direct or indirect early response of the fruitlet to the carbohydrate shortage.

shading during early fruit development retards fruit growth by decreasing cell division and expansion  <cit> . reductions in cell division have been associated with coordinated alterations in the expression of some key cell-cycle genes  <cit> . even though the current study found that only cdk inhibitor was up-regulated, it also showed that six cell-cycle-related unigenes were repressed by shading, including cyclin-dependent kinase , cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase  and some cell-division control proteins. these results are also consistent with those from previous studies in apples  <cit> .

some research groups have exploited the fact that dark-induced cell death is usually accompanied by chlorophyll degradation, protein hydrolysis, ros generation, and cell-wall modification  <cit> . in this study, eight unigenes related to cell death were up-regulated by shading, particularly cysteine protease and senescence-associated and autophagy-related genes. shading also had a large impact on protein ubiquitination and degradation; for example, f-box proteins, 26s proteasome subunit proteins, ubiquitin e <dig> ligase complex including cullin and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes were positively regulated in response to shading, which is in agreement with the findings in apples  <cit> . different levels of dark-induced ros production have also been reported during the senescence process  <cit> . only a core nadph oxidase unigene was increased in the shaded litchi fruitlet. in contrast, some unigenes, involving in the cellular response to oxidative stress, were induced such as a glutathione s-transferase, two glutaredoxin and six thioredoxin genes. it has been previously pointed out that shading has an effect on cell-wall loosening and degradation  <cit> . however, in our study, only two cell-wall degradation related genes  were induced after shading treatment. three cellulose synthases, two cell-wall structure genes and a single callose synthase, involved in the secondary cell-wall formation and stress resistance  <cit>  were induced. these results indicated that fruits active cellular oxidation resistance and cell-wall formation in response to low-light stress. more than 92% of the differentially expressed unigenes related to stress response were up-regulated, including a large group of resistant genes against diverse stress conditions in this study.

a complex combination of signalling pathways has been proposed to play important roles in the modulation of fruit development. hormone signalling is key for the coordination of fruit growth, fruit abscission and plant defence  <cit> . as many as  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were hormone-related and involved in the signal transduction pathways of auxins, brassinosteroids, gibberellins, jasmonic acid and polyamine. all of them were up-regulated, except for a single auxin efflux carrier gene, in response to the shading treatment. it is puzzling that no unigene, related to abscisic acid , ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, was found to be significantly changed by shading. in fact, aba and ethylene have been implicated in the regulation of stress-induced senescence. several genes involved in aba and ethylene biosynthesis and signalling were induced in the shading-treated fruit abscission zone in apples  <cit> . however, several groups of transcription factors associated with senescence and stress, such as ap2/erf, nac, wrky and zinc finger  families, were all largely increased in the shaded fruits, which is consistent with the results on leaf senescence in arabidopsis by shading  <cit> . another group of differentially expressed genes involved in atp-binding cassette, calcium binding and membrane transport, as well as those involved in the transportation of sugars, amino acids, nucleosides, proteins, lipids, anions and cations. as previously mentioned above, shading during early fruit development reduces canopy photosynthesis and enhances competition between fruits. this results in the alteration of available carbohydrate and transportation of nutrients in favour of shoot growth and at the expense of fruit development  <cit> . therefore,  <dig> out of  <dig> transcription factors were positively induced by shading in our study, which might reflect the shifting function of the shaded fruitlet, as they become a source tissue for the mobilization of nutrients to other vegetative organs.

differentially regulated genes involved in litchi fruitlet abscission in response to shading
the imposition of shading treatment during early fruit development promotes fruit abscission in several crops including apples  <cit> , peaches  <cit>  and grapes  <cit> . shade is presumed to induce a transient reduction in the supply of carbohydrates to developing fruit during a period when the fruit is sensitive to such a stress. shade-induced fruit abscission begins about  <dig> to  <dig> days after shading and peaks at  <dig> days  <cit> . zhou et al. <cit>  and zhu et al. <cit>  have exploited dark-induced fruit abscission to characterize many altered metabolic pathways and transcript abundance during this senescence process. in our study, shading treatment significantly stimulated fruit drop from  <dig> days after treatment and induced  <dig> % of the fruit to abscise within  <dig> days, compared with a  <dig> % fruit loss within the same time period in the control. fourteen differentially regulated unigenes, between shaded and non-shaded dta-tag profiling libraries, were randomly selected in order to compare their expression patterns with the fruit abscission dynamics during shading treatment. the qrt-pcr results of all the selected up-regulated unigenes obtained on day  <dig> agreed with the expression levels described by dta. it is possible that transcriptional changes in response to shading occurred and exerted their effects at the early stage of the abscission process and thus became less apparent after  <dig> days.

two factors for comparison between expression profiles were considered: whether the mrna transcript abundance continued to be generally increased or decreased after days of treatment; and whether the relative expression ratio in samples undergoing shaded treatment was significantly higher than that in the controls at specific sampling dates, particularly at the early stage  after treatment. according to these two criteria,  <dig> of the selected differentially regulated shading-responsive genes are regarded as being involved in the process of fruitlet abscission. six of these genes are also documented as being related to the shedding of plant organs,including chi <cit> , ffu <cit> , gh <dig> <cit> , samdc <cit> , myb <cit>  and pmei <cit> . the remaining five genes  have not yet been reported in the literature to be involved in organ shedding. the expression of as can be induced in a range of low-carbohydrate situations, such as dark periods and sugar-starved treatment  <cit> . moreover, an as gene promoter has been identified as a potential carbohydrate-responsive element in asparagus <cit> . after shading treatment, the expression of as in litchi fruit was immediately up-regulated and was consistently increased during fruit abscission, indicating that as expression might be a direct effect of the low-carbohydrate conditions. acl catalyzes the atp-dependant reaction of citrate and coenzyme a to form acetyl- coenzyme a and oxaloacetic acid  <cit> . in our study, the expression of acl displayed a down-regulated profile after shading treatment, showing that fruit need more energy to maintain the normal physiological functions under low-carbohydrate conditions. some indirect evidence supported the possibility that ros generation is related to the organ abscission  <cit> . thioredoxin is a ubiquitous small redox active protein in plants that plays a critical role in redox balance regulation through thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. the transcript level of tnl <dig> in this study was found to be significantly increased as shading-induced fruit abscission progressed, suggesting that it might be involved in regulating fruit drop by influencing stress responses. the transcript levels of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme genes  from allotetraploid cotton have been found to increase significantly in leaves and flowers at senescence, indicating that ghubc1/ <dig> may play a role in the degradation of target proteins that function in delaying the senescence program  <cit> . the litchi ubce <dig> unigene in our study was found to be significantly and consistently up-regulated in the shaded fruits, implying that shading-induced fruit abscission induced by shading treatment might be, to some extent, related to the organ senescence and triggered by ubce <dig> up-regulated expression. ll-diaminopimelate aminotransferase, discovered in  <dig>  is a crucial enzyme in the plant lysine biosynthetic pathway, which converts tetrahydrodipicolinate to ll-diaminopimelate in a single step  <cit> . lysine is an amino acid essential for peptidoglycan synthesis. there is information in the literature concerning the relationship between ll-dap-at or peptidoglycan and organ shedding. however, our study showed that the ll-dap-at unigene transcript level in shaded fruit continued to be increased and significantly higher in shaded fruit compared with controls from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after shading treatment, indicating that ll-dap-at might have some role in regulating fruit abscission.

it is not surprising that some of the genes, differentially regulated in response to shading, are involved in fruitlet abscission since shading during early fruit development induces an increase in fruitlet drop. however, our study was carried out when fruitlet abscission was occurring, and the expression-pattern analysis of genes in both dta and qrt-pcr experiments were compared between abscission and increased abscission. this would go some way to making accurate transcriptional changes difficult to measure. thus, comparing between rna samples from abscission induced by shading versus no abscission in the control should be suggested in the future experiments to find out the candidate genes specifically responsible for fruitlet abscission in litchi.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we present the sequencing, de novo assembly and analysis of the fruit transcriptome and provide a global description of transcript abundance profiles in fruits from shaded and unshaded trees using next-generation sequencing technology in litchi chinensis. the transcriptome is described in details in the results section, with an emphasis on annotation using the nr, swiss-prot, kegg and cog databases. we generated more than  <dig> million paired-end reads and assembled  <dig>  unigenes. using the dta method, a total of  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million high-quality tags were obtained from the shaded and non-shaded libraries, respectively. of these high quality tags,  <dig>  regulated tag entities, which were mapped to  <dig>  unigenes, showed significant differential expression, suggesting that these potential regulators might function in response to the shading signal. furthermore, some of shading-induced differentially expressed unigenes were implicated in the fruitlet abscission process in litchi, shedding new light on the molecular mechanisms involved in organ abscission.
