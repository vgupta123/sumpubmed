BACKGROUND
the clinical importance of yeast infections has increased during the last decades, not only because the number of yeast infections has increased, but also because yeast infections have become a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients  <cit> . besides the higher frequency there is also an important change in the spectrum of the species causing clinical infections. whereas candida albicans has long been considered as the clinically most important species of the genus, the occurrence and pathogenic importance of the non-albicans species has been increasing steadily  <cit> . because antifungal susceptibility is differing between the species, rapid and reliable identification of the clinical isolates can contribute to an efficient therapy of the patient  <cit> . the conventional identification of yeast isolates depends on biochemical properties such as assimilation and fermentation reactions and morphology  <cit> , features which are not always stable, which are often not easy to interpret, and which may be time-consuming  <cit> . biochemical identification has been standardized and automated   <cit> , but this approach equally suffers from the limitations of phenotypic identification in general. as a solution for those problems, several pcr-based methods have been described. some of these approaches rely on species-specific probes  <cit>  – being limited to those species for which probes are available, but most of them are based on amplification using universal fungal primers, followed by post-amplification analysis like probe hybridization  <cit> , sequencing  <cit> , restriction analysis  <cit> , temperature gradient gel electrophoresis  <cit>  or – most simply and least laborious – fragment length determination  <cit> . in addition, fingerprinting techniques primarily developed for strain typing are also used for identification: rapd  <cit>  and aflp  <cit> . finally, techniques like real-time pcr  <cit> , pyrosequencing  <cit>  and luminex flow cytometry  <cit>  have been used for identification of yeasts.

the principle of internal transcribed spacer  <dig> -pcr was initially described by turenne et al.  <cit> . amplification of the its2-pcr is followed by capillary electrophoresis for the precise determination of the fragment length, whereby the length of the fragment is used for identification. evaluation, adaptation and expansion of the number of species included has been carried out at our laboratory and has resulted in a publicly available database, listing the its2-sizes for  <dig> yeast species  <cit> . subsequently, an interlaboratory evaluation indicated that the its2-pcr technique and the database could be exchanged between different laboratories, when using the same electrophoresis platform, i.e. abi <dig>   <cit> .

our present aim was to evaluate the interlaboratory exchangeability of the technique between laboratories using different capillary electrophoresis systems, i.e. abi <dig> versus ceq <dig> , for the size determination of the amplified its2-fragments.

RESULTS
construction of an its2-length library using ceq8000
since its2-fragment length determination on ceq <dig> was expected to be different from that obtained on abi <dig>  we determined the length of a set of  <dig> reference strains, representing  <dig> species and subspecies, using the ceq <dig> capillary electrophoresis apparatus. the obtained lengths on ceq <dig> are listed in table  <dig>  and are compared with the lengths obtained on abi <dig>  as reported earlier  <cit> , and with the theoretically expected lengths, as derived from published sequences.

it could be observed that the values obtained on the ceq <dig> were always higher than on abi <dig>  the size differences were in the range of  <dig>  basepairs  for c. neoformans subsp. gattii  to  <dig>  bp for malassezia furfur , with an average of  <dig>  bp . there was no correlation between fragment size and size difference and there was no constant size difference. as illustrated in table  <dig> , we could neither establish a correlation between %gc-content of the its2-region and migration differences as observed on both machines.

the accuracy of fragment length calculation by ceq <dig> seemed to be somewhat higher than that achieved by abi <dig>  since in  <dig> of  <dig> cases the calculated length on ceq <dig> was closer to the theoretical length than that calculated on abi <dig> . although the absolute lengths obtained on ceq <dig> differed from those on abi <dig>  fragment length determination of the amplified its <dig> region on ceq <dig> enabled discrimination between the same species that could be differentiated on the abi <dig>  all species included could be identified to species level, except for the members of the genus trichosporon, for which four of the five tested species had the same its2-fragment length. since none of all other yeast species tested had an its <dig> of this length, the trichosporon species could be identified as a group.

applicability
the obtained its2-fragment lengths for the different species on ceq <dig>  were used as reference values with which its2-lengths of unknowns were compared.

its2-fragment length determination on the ceq <dig> enabled the identification of the yeasts present in the cultures of  <dig> clinical samples, of which  <dig> samples contained different yeast species simultaneously. the following species and mixtures of species were identified: c. albicans , c. albicans + c. glabrata , c. albicans + c. parapsilosis , c. glabrata , c. guilliermondii , c. kefyr , c. parapsilosis , c. tropicalis , c. tropicalis + c. albicans , c. tropicalis + c. albicans + c. glabrata , c. tropicalis + c. glabrata , c. krusei , and ustilago maydis . no misidentifications occurred, compared to phenotypic identification.

exchangeability of data
to evaluate the exchangeability of the technique between two laboratories using a different capillary electrophoresis apparatus, clinical strains were exchanged. laboratory g identified  <dig> clinical isolates from the ghent university hospital on abi <dig> and sent these to laboratory a, where identification was carried out on ceq <dig>  laboratory a identified the clinical isolates from  <dig> cultured samples from the onze lieve vrouw ziekenhuis aalst, using the ceq <dig> and sent these to laboratory g, where identification was carried out on abi <dig>  the results of this comparison are presented in table  <dig> . the identification obtained with its2-pcr in both laboratories was in agreement for  <dig> of the  <dig> cultures. one culture yielded another identification, respectively as c. albicans using the ceq <dig> and as c. krusei by means of the abi <dig>  retesting at laboratory a indicated that the sample contained a mixture of both species, while repeated culture and retesting at laboratory g yielded again only c. krusei.

based on culture results, one sample  was thought to contain a mixture of c. albicans and a non-albicans isolate. both its2-pcr identification systems revealed that the mixture contained in fact three species, namely c. albicans, c. tropicalis and c. glabrata.

during this study, one isolate was misidentified in both laboratories using its2-pcr. an isolate identified biochemically as c. dubliniensis, was identified as c. krusei by means of its2-pcr in both laboratories. its2-sequencing, whereby the obtained sequence was compared to all known sequences in genbank using blast, confirmed the biochemical identification as c. dubliniensis. the its2-sequence showed highest sequence similarity to c. dubliniensis, but contained a 2-bp indel  compared to the its <dig> sequence of the c. dubliniensis reference strains that had been used to construct the its2-length library. genbank contains  <dig> its <dig> sequences of c. dubliniensis, of which  <dig> have the 2-bp indel.

the its <dig> size library lists c. krusei as having a two bp shorter its <dig> size than that of c. dubliniensis and this explains the misidentification. this finding was added to the library, cautioning that in some cases c. dubliniensis strains with an aberrant its <dig> fragment length may occur and thus may result in a misidentification as c. krusei.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
its2-pcr followed by fragment length determination by capillary electrophoresis on abi <dig>  has been shown to be a fast and efficient identification technique for clinically important yeast species  <cit>  and for which data are exchangeable between laboratories using the same capillary electrophoresis system  <cit> . here we evaluated whether comparative discriminatory power could be obtained on another capillary electrophoresis apparatus, in casu on ceq <dig>  and whether identifications obtained in different laboratories using different capillary electrophoresis systems were identical.

since the fragment length estimation differs between different capillary electrophoresis systems, it was found necessary to recreate an its <dig> length library for the ceq <dig>  the different size estimation most probably results from migration differences between different systems, caused by the usage of different fluorescent labels on the primers and of different polymers in the capillaries. also the use of different marker fragments may result in differences between calculated lengths. it was observed that size estimations on ceq <dig> were always higher than on abi <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp differences, without any notable consistency in the observed differences.

however, differences were constant for each species, such that a new library for ceq <dig> could be constructed. it was found that the species that could be differentiated from each other by its <dig> length determination on abi <dig> could also be differentiated by using the ceq <dig> 

its2-pcr was not very useful for differentiation between species of the genus trichosporon. identification of trichosporon species was also impossible by its2-pcr on the abi <dig>  <cit> , and even sequencing of the its <dig> region is not always sufficient for final discrimination between all the species  <cit> . a more reliable identification of trichosporon spp. can be obtained by sequencing a more variable region like igs <dig>   <cit>  or making use of species specific probes and detection of hybridization in the luminex flow cytometer  <cit> .

during this study, both an additional problem and an additional possiblity of its <dig> fragment length determination for the identification of yeast species was encountered.

apparently, strains with aberrant its <dig> lengths occur. here, a strain of which the biochemical identification as c. dubliniensis was confirmed by its2-sequence determination was misidentified by both laboratories as c. krusei, when identification was based on its-length determination. it could be shown that this was the result of a  <dig> bp indel of the its2-region of this strain, an indel which is present in  <dig> of the  <dig> published c. dubliniensis sequences. further research is needed to find out whether the subdivision that can be made on the basis of its2-length corresponds to epidemiological or clinical relevance. an additional advantage of its2-pcr was observed when a mixed culture was studied. in order to identify the separate species present in mixed cultures, isolation of the cultures is necessary when identification is based on biochemical features or on sequencing of genes. however, when using its2-pcr on either ceq <dig> or abi <dig>  the different species present can be identified immediately, since one will obtain an its2-fingerprint composed of several peaks, each with a length corresponding to the respective species present in the mixed sample.

our results obtained on mixed culture samples indicate that its2-pcr could be applied for direct, non culture based, simultaneous detection of different species from a clinical sample. whether this will be possible, will only depend on the strength of the dna-extraction method used.
