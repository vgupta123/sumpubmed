BACKGROUND
acid soils are prevalent in many regions of the world and present a range of stresses to plants. one of the major stresses caused by these soils is aluminum , which is solubilized by the acidity into the soil solution. soluble al exists in its most toxic form as al3+, which can inhibit root growth in many plant species at micromolar concentrations. the resulting reduced and damaged root system limits the capacity of plants to uptake water and nutrients, and increases their susceptibility to other stresses.

the mechanisms by which al inhibits root growth are not well understood, despite extensive physiological investigations. the root apex is the most sensitive part of the root to al because it is the site of cell division and cell elongation  <cit> . since al is so reactive, it can interact with multiple structures in the apoplasm and symplasm of root cells. in the cell wall, al primarily binds to the pectin matrix and thereby alters the physical properties of the cell wall  <cit> . in the symplasm, sites of al interaction include membrane constituents, ion channels, metabolic enzymes, components of signaling pathways, members of the cytoskeleton, and the dna  <cit> . although some of the resulting cellular alterations have been proposed to affect cell division or cell elongation, a recent study conducted in arabidopsis thaliana indicates that it is not al toxicity that is directly responsible for the inhibition of root growth. genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that the cells of the root apex have an atr-controlled mechanism to monitor al-induced dna damage  <cit> . in plants exposed to al, this mechanism activates blockage of cell cycle progression and thus root growth. this active response of roots to al may not protect individual plants, but it may help to safeguard plant populations by preventing the passage of damaged dna to subsequent plant generations  <cit> .

plant species vary considerably in their degree of al tolerance, and even genotypes within the same plant species vary in their ability to cope with al. the mechanisms providing enhanced al tolerance can be classified into external and internal mechanisms  <cit> . the best-documented external mechanism is the efflux of organic acid anions, such as malate, citrate, and oxalate, from the roots in response to al exposure  <cit> . these organic acid anions effectively chelate al and thereby detoxify al in the rhizosphere. other proposed external mechanisms involve secretion of proteins  <cit> , root-mediated increase of the rhizosphere ph  <cit> , and masking al binding sites at the cell wall  <cit> . proposed internal tolerance mechanisms include chelation of al by organic acid anions or phenolic compounds and sequestration of al in the vacuole  <cit> .

the genes responsible for the al-induced efflux of malate and citrate have been recently isolated and demonstrated to represent major genes for al tolerance in several plant species  <cit> . the genes responsible for the efflux of malate belong to the almt  gene family  <cit>  and those involved in the efflux of citrate to the mate  gene family  <cit> . all these genes encode membrane proteins, consistent with their role in facilitating the efflux of organic acid anions. additional genes with putative roles in al tolerance have been identified in al-sensitive mutants of rice  and arabidopsis. the rice mutants star <dig>  and star <dig> were found to be mutated in genes encoding two proteins that form together an atp-binding cassette  transporter  <cit> . this complex mediates the transport of udp-glucose to the cell wall, where the molecule is believed to play a role in masking al binding sites. similarly to star <dig> and star <dig>  the al-sensitive mutants als <dig>  and als <dig> of arabidopsis are mutated in genes encoding abc transporter-like proteins  <cit> . although the substrate of these proteins is not known, the mutant phenotypes and patterns of gene expression have led to the proposal that the two proteins transport and sequester al to confer al tolerance. als <dig> is believed to be involved in the intracellular transport of al to the vacuole  <cit> , whereas als <dig> appears to be necessary for the long-distance transport of al to the aerial parts of the plant  <cit> .

further insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in al toxicity and tolerance come from gene expression analyses. genome-wide transcriptome analyses in roots of arabidopsis have revealed a number of cellular processes that are altered in response to al exposure. examples are cell wall modification, protein metabolism, transport processes, and oxidative stress  <cit> . in maize , wheat , and medicago truncatula, gene expression was analyzed in plant lines with contrasting levels of al tolerance  <cit> . these studies have led to the identification of several candidate genes for al tolerance, including previously identified genes encoding organic acid efflux transporters, genes controlling levels of reactive oxygen species , as well as genes involved in pectin modification and immobilization of al by phosphate.

forest trees generally tolerate high concentrations of al  <cit> . for example, seedlings of norway spruce  and birch  did not show any reduction in root growth at al concentrations below  <dig>  and  <dig> mm, respectively  <cit> . in contrast, al concentrations as low as  <dig> μm tend to affect the root growth of arabidopsis and several crop plants . since many forest tree species grow naturally in acid soils, it appears likely that such species have developed adaptive mechanisms that enable them to tolerate high al conditions. analyses of the root responses to al in forest trees may thus broaden our understanding of al tolerance mechanisms in plants.

in a previous study, we used clonal aspen  to investigate al-induced efflux of organic acid anions from roots  <cit> . the results showed that al concentrations ≥  <dig> μm induced the efflux of citrate, while al concentrations ≥  <dig> μm enhanced the efflux of oxalate. at these concentrations, al did not cause any visible symptoms at the root tips, indicating that the aspen clone examined tolerates high concentrations of al. using the same aspen clone, we investigated temporal patterns of root gene expression under al stress. changes in gene expression were assessed by application of the affymetrix poplar genome array. the expression of selected genes was further analyzed by reverse-transcription pcr.

RESULTS
effect of al on root growth and callose formation
to determine plant treatment conditions suitable for gene expression profiling, we examined the effect of al on root growth. clonal aspen was treated with either no al or increasing concentrations of al up to  <dig> μm for  <dig> d in solution culture . exposure of the roots to  <dig> μm al did not affect their growth . in contrast,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μm al caused a rapid and strong inhibition of root growth, with a reduction in growth rate of ≥ 40% observed after  <dig> h. during prolonged al exposure, the root growth of plants treated with  <dig> and  <dig> μm al partially recovered, while that of plants treated with  <dig> μm further decreased, although not significantly . as a further indicator of al toxicity, we quantified callose, which accumulates in many plant species upon al exposure  <cit> . the content of callose in the root tips increased with al in the medium, with a significant increase observed at al concentrations ≥  <dig> μm .

root growth of plants used for gene expression profiling
based on the results of the dose-response experiment, plants were treated with  <dig> μm al for gene expression profiling. treatment with  <dig> μm was preferred over  <dig> μm, which tended to cause necrotic lesions at the root tips. the time points selected were  <dig> h,  <dig> h , and  <dig> h . the  <dig> h time point marked the rapid al-induced inhibition of root growth. the  <dig> and  <dig> d time points represented the period of root growth recovery. since some plant genes are regulated by a diurnal rhythm and circadian clock, the exact duration of the treatments were designed such that the roots could be sampled at the same time each. during the  <dig> d treatment, the culture medium was exchanged every  <dig> d to maintain a constant al stress. consistent with the results of the dose-response experiment, al induced a rapid inhibition of root growth . the growth of roots treated with al for  <dig> and  <dig> d gradually recovered . al concentrations of the culture medium decreased only slightly during the  <dig> d treatment periods , and the ph remained constant . therefore, the increase in root growth could not be explained by either a possible decrease of al in the culture medium due to the uptake of al by the plants, or altered al speciation due to ph change.

changes in gene expression
gene expression profiles were determined using the affymetrix poplar genome array, interrogating over  <dig>  transcripts and gene predictions. to detect genes that are significantly regulated by al, we employed an approach that allowed an estimation of the false discovery rate  in multiple testing. the q-value, which is a positive fdr analogue of the p-value  <cit> , was set to  <dig> . as a further criterion, we used a two-fold change cut-off. by these criteria and after removing redundant probe sets, a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed. treatment of the roots for  <dig> h resulted in the up-regulation of  <dig> genes and the down-regulation of  <dig> genes . these numbers decreased significantly when the roots were treated for  <dig> d . of the induced genes at this time point,  <dig> were also induced after  <dig> h. treatment of the roots for  <dig> d yielded a similar low number of responsive genes . three genes were induced across all three time points.

validation of microarray data
the microarray data were independently verified by real-time reverse transcription pcr . eight genes were analyzed, displaying a wide range of expression profiles. transcripts were quantified relative to the actin  <dig>  gene, which was isolated and sequenced in this study. the qrt-pcr analyses were performed with rna from the microarray experiment  and with rna from an independent al treatment experiment . six genes were tested with the rna from both experiments. a significant correlation was found between the microarray and qrt-pcr data . the magnitude of the relative changes in transcript abundance did not differ greatly between the two techniques. exceptions were two strongly induced genes encoding a basic pathogenesis-related protein and a family  <dig> sulfate transporter: expression differences measured by qrt-pcr were  <dig> times greater than those measured by microarrays, probably due to the fact that qrt-pcr has a wider dynamic range than microarrays  <cit> . to examine the validity of using act <dig> as a reference gene, absolute qrt-pcr was performed. the analysis showed that the expression of the gene did not change significantly during the  <dig> d treatment .

annotation and functional categorization of al-responsive genes
blastx searches against the arabidopsis protein database allowed  <dig> of the responsive genes to be annotated -value ≤  <dig> × 10-10). additional  <dig> genes had matches to arabidopsis genes with unknown functions, and  <dig> genes had no detectable similarity to arabidopsis proteins . a complete list of the responsive genes is presented in additional file  <dig> 

to identify biological processes, the genes with known functions were classified using the munich information center for protein sequences  functional catalogue  <cit> . the genes present on the microarray were also classified to allow identification of categories whose genes were over-represented compared to the genes present on the microarray. these analyses were carried out for the genes regulated after  <dig> h and for the combined set of genes regulated after  <dig> and  <dig> d. top-level categories and subcategories with an enrichment p-value <  <dig>  and a fdr <  <dig>  were regarded as pertinent to the time points examined. by these criteria, genes assigned to the top-level categories 'metabolism' and 'cell rescue and defense' were enriched after  <dig> h . within the 'metabolism' category, the genes related to 'carbohydrate metabolism' were enriched and included several genes involved in cell wall modification . additional enriched genes related to cell wall modification were assigned to the top-level category 'biogenesis of cellular components'. the top-level category 'cell rescue and defense' included a number of enriched genes related to 'oxidative stress response' and 'detoxification'. an additional major group of enriched genes had functions in 'ion transport'. smaller groups of enriched genes were related to 'cell death' and 'plant signaling molecules'. genes implicated in 'ion transport' and 'carbohydrate metabolism' were also enriched during prolonged al exposure, but their number was small . additional genes enriched during prolonged al exposure were assigned to the top-level categories 'energy' and 'interaction with the environment' .

genes related to cell wall modification
all the genes recorded that are related to cell wall modification were regulated after  <dig> h of al exposure . nine of these genes have functions in the modification of pectin. a pectin methylesterase gene, two pectate lyase genes, and two galacturonosyltransferase genes were down-regulated. of the three pectin methylesterase inhibitor genes identified, two were down-regulated and the other induced. additional genes encoded proteins that target cellulose and xyloglucan. the three endo- <dig> -β-glucanase and three xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase genes recorded showed contrasting patterns of up- and down-regulated expression.

genes related to ion transport
the regulated genes encoding ion transporters included both cation and anion transporters. with the exception of a ferritin gene, all the ion transporters were induced. a two-pore k+ channel gene was closely related to the arabidopsis gene tpk <dig>  which is a key regulator of k homeostasis  <cit> . two genes encoded cora-like mg transporters, belonging to a class of transmembrane proteins that are suggested to function in the uptake and intracellular transport of mg  <cit> . the anion transporters were composed of a family  <dig> phosphate transporter and two family  <dig> sulfate transporter genes. the encoded family  <dig> phosphate transporter was related to the arabidopsis protein pht4; <dig>  proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides  <cit> . one of the encoded sulfate transporters was related to the arabidopsis sultr3; <dig>  a protein functioning in the root-to-shoot transport of sulfate  <cit> .

genes related to oxidative stress
three of the regulated genes related to oxidative stress belong to the network of genes that control levels of ros  <cit> . an alternative oxidase and a fe superoxide dismutase gene were up-regulated, while a glutaredoxin gene was down-regulated. additional genes encoded tau-type glutathione s-transferases and peroxidases. individual members of these gene families showed contrasting patterns of up- and down-regulated expression.

identification of putative al tolerance genes
among the regulated genes encoding transport facilitators, there were two genes that may play a role in al tolerance. one was related to the arabidopsis al tolerance gene als <dig>  <cit> . the other belonged to the mate gene family and was related to the arabidopsis citrate efflux transporter gene mate  <cit>  and to frd <dig> , which encodes a citrate transporter responsible for loading fe into the xylem  <cit> . both aspen genes were induced: als <dig> was up-regulated at all three time points, and mate at  <dig> h and  <dig> d.

to examine whether the genes identified by microarrays are indeed genes related to the arabidopsis als <dig> and mate, rt-pcr was performed and the pcr products were sequenced. in the case of als <dig>  the entire coding sequence was isolated. the predicted protein shared 79% sequence identity with the arabidopsis als <dig>  <cit>  and 71% with star <dig> of rice  <cit> . all of these genes encode the transmembrane domain of abc transporters and lack the atp-binding cassette domain. in the case of mate, approximately 80% was isolated. the predicted protein shared 60% sequence identity with the arabidopsis mate  <cit>  and 62% with frd <dig>  <cit> . similar degrees of sequence identities were found between the aspen mate and mate of sorghum   <cit> , barley   <cit> , and maize   <cit> .

expression of als <dig> and mate
each of the three arabidopsis genes als <dig>  mate, and frd <dig> are characterized by a distinct pattern of expression. under non-stressed conditions, als <dig> is expressed in the phloem throughout the plant and in the root epidermis  <cit> . mate and frd <dig> are primarily expressed in the root  <cit> . exposure to al strongly induces als <dig> and mate in the root, but not frd <dig>  <cit> . to examine whether the expression of the aspen als <dig> and mate is coherent with that of the arabidopsis als <dig> and mate, absolute qrt-pcr was carried out with rna isolated from root, stem, and leaf tissue of a separate set of plants treated with either no al or  <dig> μm al for  <dig> d. the results of the analysis showed that als <dig> is expressed in all three tissues under non-stress conditions with little differences among the tissues . in contrast, mate was more strongly expressed in the root than in the stem and leaves . treatment of the plants with al led to an induction of both genes . als <dig> was strongly induced in the root  and to a lower extent in the stem , while mate was induced both in the root  and in the stem . the expression levels of act <dig> did not differ between the treatments, but did between the tissues, where they were highest in the root . however, the differences in act <dig> expression in the different tissues did not explain the tissue-specific expression of als <dig> and mate, as was shown by plotting transcript levels relative to act <dig> . taken together, expression patterns of the two aspen genes were highly coherent with that of the arabidopsis als <dig> and mate.

to examine whether al induces the two genes in a concentration-dependent way, a separate set of plants were treated with increasing concentrations of al up to  <dig> μm al. plants were also treated with increasing concentrations of lanthanum , which has chemical properties similar to those of al and is known to inhibit root growth  <cit> . root growth measurements showed that la inhibited root growth in a similar way to al, but the inhibition was stronger . absolute qrt-pcr showed that the expression of both genes increased with al in the medium . in contrast, exposure of the roots to la induced mate, but not als <dig> . based on levels of act <dig> expression, it appeared that la concentrations ≥  <dig> μm, affected transcription .

discussion
in this study, we analyzed temporal patterns of root growth and root gene expression in aspen under al stress. two phases of root growth could be distinguished: a rapid al-induced growth inhibition  and a subsequent growth recovery. from our analysis of gene expression at three time points, we found a pronounced decrease in the number of responsive genes from  <dig> to  <dig> between  <dig> h and  <dig> d of al exposure. the number of changes then remained low. similar patterns of root growth and gene expression were observed in an al-tolerant line of medicago truncatula  <cit> . the root growth of this line largely recovered within  <dig> d of al exposure, while that of an al-sensitive line remained inhibited. the number of responsive genes was found to decrease in both lines between  <dig> h and  <dig> d of al exposure, but the reduction was stronger in the al-tolerant line  than in the al-sensitive line . these patterns may reflect the success of roots in activating al tolerance mechanisms and the restoration of the transcriptome to a prestress program, and in the case of the al-sensitive line of medicago the failure to establish an adaptive response.

consistent with the strong al-induced root growth inhibition at the  <dig> h time point, a number of differentially expressed genes can be associated with toxic effects of al. our enrichment analysis identified cell wall modification, ion transport, and oxidative stress as major biological processes operating at this time point. the regulation of cell wall-related genes was not surprising because the cell wall is considered to be a major site of al toxicity  <cit> . physiological studies show consistently that a large portion of the al absorbed by roots is localized to the apoplasm  <cit> . several studies indicate that the al bound to the apoplasm can make the cell wall more rigid, thus reducing its extensibility, which is required for normal cell extension  <cit> . plants are believed to employ several different mechanisms to loosen the cell wall during cell extension. proposed cell wall loosening agents include expansin, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase , endo- <dig> -β-glucanase, and hydroxyl radicals  <cit> . in this study, we recorded several genes encoding xhts and endo- <dig> -β-glucanases, with some of the genes being up-regulated and others being down-regulated. these contrasting responses may reflect the different enzymatic functions that members of the xht and endo- <dig> -β-glucanase protein families can fulfill  <cit> . although the exact function of the xht and endo- <dig> -β-glucanase genes identified is not known, it appears likely that these genes play a role in minimizing the toxic effects of al on the cell wall. a number of physiological studies demonstrate that al strongly interacts with membrane channel proteins, resulting in the disruption of the uptake and homeostasis of cations, such as ca, mg, and k  <cit> . in our study, we recorded up-regulation of a two-pore k+ channel gene and two cora-like mg transporter genes, indicating that al interferes with k and mg homeostasis in aspen roots. mg transporters have so far not been found to be al inducible. nevertheless, two lines of evidence indicate that mg transporters play an important role in al toxicity. the activity of a cora-like mg transporter of arabidopsis was shown to be blocked by micromolar concentrations of al  <cit> . in addition, the same cora-like mg transporter alleviated al toxicity when overexpressed in planta  <cit> . although oxidative stress is commonly regarded to be a major component of al toxicity, we recorded only a small number of genes belonging to the ros network of genes. a fe superoxide dismutase and a mitochondrial alternative oxidase gene were up-regulated. while fe superoxide dismutases are responsible for ros scavenging  <cit> , alternative oxidases serve to lower mitochondrial ros formation  <cit> . induction of the alternative oxidase is entirely in agreement with the finding that al can induce ros formation in mitochondria  <cit> .

based on information from arabidopsis and crop plants, three differentially expressed aspen genes may play a role in al tolerance mechanisms. two genes were closely related to the arabidopsis al tolerance genes als <dig> and mate. patterns of expression in different plant organs and in response to al strongly suggest that the two aspen genes are homologs of the arabidopsis als <dig> and mate. the exact function of the arabidopsis als <dig> is not known. mutant als <dig> seedlings grown in al-containing medium exhibit a severe arrest of root growth and inhibited leaf expansion  <cit> . based on this phenotype and patterns of tissue-specific expression, als <dig> has been proposed to mediate transport of al away from sensitive root tissues to aerial parts of the plant for sequestration or exudation  <cit> . the arabidopsis als <dig> is expressed in the phloem throughout the plant and is strongly induced by al in the root cortex  <cit> . our aspen als <dig> gene was expressed in the root, stem, and leaves, and was strongly induced by al in the root. in addition, the aspen als <dig> was inducible by al, but not by la. this is consistent with the finding that the arabidopsis mutant als <dig> is not affected by la  <cit> . based on information from arabidopsis, it appears likely that the aspen gene identified is functioning in internal al tolerance. the predicted aspen als <dig> also shared significant sequence identity with star <dig> of rice, which has been suggested to be involved in masking al binding sites at the cell wall. however, since star <dig> is expressed in the root only  <cit> , it seems unlikely that the aspen gene is a homolog of star <dig>  the second putative aspen al tolerance gene belongs to the mate gene family. members of this gene family mediate the release of citrate into the rhizosphere and have been demonstrated to represent major genes of al tolerance in several plant species  <cit> . the aspen mate was primarily expressed in the root and was inducible by al, a pattern comparable to that of the arabidopsis mate and mate of other plant species  <cit> . previously, we have shown that aspen releases citrate and oxalate from roots in response to al exposure. therefore, it is possible that the aspen mate is involved in the release of citrate and that this mechanism is regulated at least in part at the transcriptional level. an additional aspen gene that may play a role in al tolerance encodes a pectin methylesterase. this gene was down-regulated early in the response to al. pectin methylesterases demethylate pectin and thereby generate free pectin carboxylic groups. the degree of pectin demethylation largely determines the negative charge the pectin matrix carries and thus the amount of al that can bind to the cell wall. in maize and rice, the degree of pectin methylation has been linked to genotypic differences in al tolerance. it was demonstrated that the root tips of al-sensitive lines had a lower degree of pectin methylation and that larger amounts of al were bound to the cell wall when compared with al-tolerant lines  <cit> . consistent with this, higher levels of pectin methylesterase expression were observed in an al-sensitive maize line than in an al-tolerant line  <cit> . down-regulation of the aspen pectin methylesterase gene thus may serve to reduce al binding sites at the pectin matrix, and consequently to limit accumulation of al in the apoplasm.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that aspen roots respond to al exposure with a rapid inhibition of root growth and a large change in gene expression. this early response to al was characterized by genes involved in cell wall modification, ion transport, and oxidative stress. the subsequent root growth recovery and the concomitant reduction in responsive genes strongly suggest that aspen roots are capable to activate al tolerance mechanisms when exposed to al. based on information from arabidopsis and other plant species, it appears likely that als <dig>  mate, and possibly a pectin methylesterase gene are important components of the al tolerance mechanisms in aspen. these genes and genes with unknown function provide candidates for further studies to elucidate the molecular basis of al tolerance in aspen.
