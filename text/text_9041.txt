BACKGROUND
the immunoglobulin genes appeared, during evolution, in vertebrates. because of their increasing physiological relevance, the evolution of these genes in fish, amphibian, birds and mammals witnessed several series of duplications that ended in adding copies and complexity to these genes. the class switch, in particular, was of importance in producing diversity <cit> , and constituted a crucial step in b cell maturation <cit> . the region involved by the somatic rearrangements, allowing the class switch, is the immunoglobulin heavy chain  locus. this domain is in a single copy in the genome of most extant species . hominoidea  are an exception, because the constant genes of the igh locus underwent duplication in their common ancestor <cit> . studies in humans have shown that the duplication of the igh locus included the regulatory region  located immediately downstream of the constant alpha exons <cit> . portions of the 3'rr were first cloned in  <dig> and  <dig> <cit>  but only later were fully assembled as a complete contig sequence because they are repeats-rich unstable regions, moreover containing palindromic sequences <cit> . in humans, the  <dig> copies of this 3' regulatory region  have been reported as 3'rr <dig> and 3'rr <dig>  <cit> . each human 3'rr copy harbors three different enhancers. the mouse and rat 3'rr possess  <dig> more boundary regulatory regions instead. their existence in other organisms may be hypothesized but have not been demonstrated yet <cit>  .

the 3'rr has a crucial role in recruiting transcription factors for the initiation of germ line transcription of the constant genes to induce igh switch <cit> . the role of the 3'rr enhancers was studied with mice transgenic for the c-myc translocation, showing the active role of hs <dig> b and hs <dig> in peripheral b-cell lymphomas progression and not in pro-b lymphomas <cit> . relevant studies demonstrate by chromosome conformation capture techniques the presence of a three-dimensional structure originated by a loop among regulatory regions during class switch recombination <cit> . new studies on 3'rr transgenic deleted mice report impairment of class switch and ig expression  <cit> . activation of the mouse 3'rr begins with selective demethylation of enhancers <cit> . binding sites variation affecting the enhancers sequence can lead to different epigenetic changes and bring cells to differently act. in our recently performed population studies we found, in fact, that some of the 3'rr enhancer hs <dig>  variants  were associated to a higher risk for autoimmune diseases onset and other immune-disorders as iga defect, systemic sclerodermia, rheumatic arthritis, psoriasis and celiac disease  <cit> . we hypothesized that the cause was a change of a binding consensus for nf-κb and other transcription factors as "in silico" predicted or experimentally determined  <cit> . in humans the presence of an allele with the nf-κb consensus site was associated to increased haematic concentration of igm, suggesting a contribution to the mechanism of class switch <cit> .

little is known on the presence and organization of the 3'rr in amniota other than human and mouse <cit> . comparative studies of this regulatory region can provide hypotheses on which elements are crucial with respect to their function <cit> . to fill the gap, we investigated the genomic organization of this region taking advantage of the sequence data present in genbank and trace archive . the most relevant achievement of the analysis was the discovering that the palindrome surrounding the hs <dig>  enhancer is present in every mammal species for which enough sequence data were available. this finding has important implication on the understanding of hs <dig>  functioning. in addition, our data supports the view that hs <dig>  polymorphisms are widely spread in the primate parvorder of catarrhini . the improvement on the comparative studies on the non coding genome is a relevant task for new insight in the epigenetic and mechanisms of genome regulation <cit> .

RESULTS
3'rr genomic organization
the mouse 3'rr region contains  <dig> enhancers , while human has only three enhancers . for this reason the mouse was used as the reference genome for the preliminary analysis. the iga class exons are the transcripted sequence closest to the 3'rr, so we included a portion of this dna in our analysis. it is to keep in mind that the iga was the last class to appear during the evolution of igh, because it is just shared among amniota species  <cit> . finally, we surveyed also a satellite repeat. this is a conserved stretch of dna  composed of tandemly repeated  <dig> bp element and located inside the 3'utr of the iga gene, close to the 3'rr enhancer.

the "comparative genomics" tracks of the ucsc mouse genome browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hggateway?org=mouse report graphical representations of lastz comparison http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/ between mouse and each one of  <dig> amniota genomes . some of these assemblies, human and mouse in particular, are very accurate. at the contrary some others are based on relatively low sequence coverage, with several unresolved gaps. this peculiar consideration has to be kept in mind when dealing with negative results of sequences comparison among genomes drafts.

results of our search for the mouse 3'rr main elements in amniota genomes are summarized in figure  <dig>  the full set of elements present in mouse  was detected only in the rat genome. the hs <dig>  hs <dig>  and hs <dig> were always absent in all the remaining species. the hs <dig>  hs <dig> , and hs <dig> set was detected with certainty in mouse, rat, dog, rabbit, panda, human, chimpanzee, and orangutan. hs <dig> and the  <dig> bp repeat, were present in  <dig> mammals, but were undetected in cow, elephant, opossum, and platypus. the region delimited by the alpha exons and hs <dig> a enhancer and encompassing the  <dig> bp repeat, appeared to be highly conserved in placental mammals. we remark that, at the contrary, the alpha marker remains entirely undetected in chicken and pig, because the similarity versus rodent iga is low even at the level of peptide sequence.

as expected, the search in the neanderthal genome <cit>  by inspection of related track in the ucsc human genome browser demonstrated that hs <dig>  hs <dig>  and hs <dig> were also present in the genome of our extinct relative .

dot plot analysis of the 3'rr
it has been already reported, in man and mouse, that each hs <dig>  enhancer is flanked, at some distance on both sides, by a  <dig> kb segment, and that these segments are in opposite orientation , as evident from the dot plot analysis reported in figure  <dig> . very interestingly, we found that this organization is shared by  <dig> species in which the whole region was included in a fully assembled contig. the human versus non-primate dot-plots are reported in figure  <dig>  it is worth noting that, while the similarity between the two components of the same palindrome is always very high , the sequence itself almost completely varied among species . interestingly, hs <dig>  always lies in the center of the palindrome. in the human 3' rr <dig>  the region internal to the two components of the palindrome is inversely oriented with respect to the corresponding sequence of 3'rr <dig>  as shown by the secondary diagonal line present at the core of the light blue frame . in addition, sequence comparisons of the human 3'rrs with non-primate mammals harboring a single copy of 3'rr  showed that in  <dig> of them, with the exception of the mouse, the orientation of the region internal to the palindrome  was identical to the human 3'rr <dig> . this finding suggests that the 3'rr <dig> is ancestral with respect to the 3'rr <dig>  the mouse showed an opposite orientation of the region internal to the palindrome. moreover the mouse palindrome is larger than the human one, including the hs <dig> and the  <dig> bp repeat, thus originating hs <dig> a and hs <dig> b . very likely, an inversion event was triggered by the palindrome both in the mouse 3'rr and in the human 3'rr <dig> 

hs <dig>  enhancer in trace archive
while no polymorphisms have been reported for the enhancers hs <dig> and hs <dig> <cit> , the  <dig> human hs <dig>  copies share a set of variant forms  <cit> . the main polymorphic feature of human hs <dig>  consists of a tandem repeated pair of elements, i.e. a  <dig> bp sequence  and a ~ <dig> bp cytosine-rich stretch , that can or cannot be separated from the enhancer core  by a  <dig> bp sequence . the hs <dig>  human variants with more copies of the  <dig> mer showed an increasing effect on the transcription of a reporter gene in transfected cells <cit> . in mouse there is just one copy of hs <dig>  that constantly harbors a single copy of the  <dig> mer.

the trace archive databases of primate species sequences was searched by blast using the human hs <dig>  sequence as query, to investigate the evolutionary history of this enhancer and to search for potential polymorphisms. figure  <dig> summarizes the obtained results, along with all the available data from previous works <cit>  and from our previously unpublished sequencing data. this figure shows the organization of the hs <dig>  in the different species. the highly conserved core of the enhancer  is constantly flanked, in the  <dig> non-primate mammalian species , by a partial  <dig> mer stretch . the  <dig> bp terminal element , constantly found in primates, was entirely detected only in panda when searched in non-primate mammals.

the most interesting finding of this analysis is the presence of a variable number of copies of the  <dig> mer  in all catarrhini parvorder species, i.e. in both hominoidea and cercopithecoidea superfamilies. on the contrary, the duplication of the whole locus of the constant genes was found only in hominoidea <cit> . this observation strongly suggests that the emergence of the polymorphism occurred earlier with respect to the duplication. the number of the  <dig> mer varies from the  <dig> copies found in chimpanzee hs <dig> , to a single one, as detected in some alleles in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla and in all the non-primate mammals. an additional variability found in hominoidea is the occasional absence of the  <dig> mer, replaced by an  <dig> bp stretch of cytosine .

hs <dig>  transcription factor binding sites 
all the hs <dig>  forms found in the different species  were searched for transcription factor binding sites, using alibaba <dig> software. relevant results are summarized in additional file  <dig> . four tfbs  are present in all the analyzed species; moreover, the nf variants are almost ubiquitous. the additional file  <dig> clearly indicates that, while the number of c/ebpalp and oct <dig> tfbs is substantially constant in different hs <dig>  forms, the number of ap-2alpha and sp <dig> tfbs is proportional to the copies of the  <dig> mer present in that specific hs <dig>  form. note that c-myc containing  <dig> mers appears only in the catarrhini hs <dig>  forms and in dog.

phylogenetic analysis
the four structures clustered in the 3'rr were analyzed for their sequence variation in  <dig> species comprising human, gorilla, orangutan, mouse, rat, rabbit, panda, dog and cat . the phylogenetic analysis obtained with the maximum likelihood method for c-alpha, hs <dig>  hs <dig>  and hs <dig> , showed in all cases a similar variation from the standard reconstruction of mammals' phylogeny. rodents and lagomorphs diverged from each other and from primates and carnivores, confirming at the nucleotide level the hypothesis of different evolutionary routes taken from the different groups, as shown after structural analysis. the concordance between the coding region  and the three enhancers in the observed divergence furthermore indicates that similar forces shaped the evolution of the whole 3' regulatory region, suggesting potential functional constrains also for the non coding sections.

discussion
in the present article we have compared the genomic structure of the 3'rr domain of the igh gene cluster in various species. we have confirmed that in all the analyzed species the 3'rr elements order is largely maintained. two main results were also achieved:  a palindromic structured sequence flanks each hs <dig>  enhancer;  hs <dig>  is polymorphic in all analyzed catarrhini species and therefore rose before of the igh locus duplication.

palindromic sequences flanking the hs <dig> 
the most relevant result of our analysis was the finding that each hs <dig>  enhancer, in all the examined species, is flanked by two  <dig> kb segments forming a palindromic structure . impressively, while the similarity of each pair of segments is extremely high, the similarity of the palindromic sequences among the different species is strikingly low. these findings suggest that the evolutionary pressure was much higher in maintaining the palindromic structure rather than the sequence conservation. as a consequence, it can be concluded that the palindrome plays a conformational role in the 3'rr functioning. the fact that the hs <dig>  enhancer is constantly placed in the middle of the sequence spacing the two inverted elements, further supports the crucial role of the conformation of the region. we hypothesize that the palindrome triggers the formation of a hairpin structure externally exposing the hs <dig>  enhancer . the orientation of hs <dig>  is therefore irrelevant for the enhancer function. indeed, it was found in different orientation in different species and also in different orientation in the two 3'rr human domains. moreover, the opposite orientations of the two hs <dig>  in human add support to the actual formation of the hairpin in vivo. the paired inverted sequences could form the stem of the hairpin. this is a fragile site that could be involved in rearrangements and translocation effect as in c-myc relocation <cit> . an exchange involving the stem may result in the inversion of the loop region, changing the hs <dig>  orientation. we can hypothesize that an inversion occurred at least two times since the divergence between homo sapiens and mus musculus . the inversions limits at least partially spanned the two palindromic regions, suggesting a cause/effect relationship. the palindrome could facilitate the inversion event, and the latter could contribute to perpetuate the palindrome.

hs <dig>  polymorphisms
population genetics of hs <dig>  polymorphisms is available only in humans, for which six distinct variants have been sequenced . the human variants result from  a variable number of the  <dig> mer and its flanking cytosine-rich box ;  the sequence connecting the constant core of the hs <dig>   to the stretches of  <dig> mer repeats, that is constituted by a  <dig> bp cytosine-rich box or by a  <dig> mer . hs <dig>  polymorphisms have been detected also in  <dig> out of  <dig> non-human primates for whom this enhancer was identified in genomic databases . we acknowledge that the number of individuals for each species present in these archives is not known, as well as the sequence coverage. we can suppose that very few individuals, maybe a single one, are present in genbank or trace archive. the variants we have detected are, therefore, very likely just the most frequent ones of each species. nevertheless, it is worth noting that the two platyrrhini  share the same hs <dig>  form of the panda. we then hypothesize that this shared form of the enhancer was also at the base of all the catarrhini variants.

iga and 3'rr have relevance in response to infections and in diseases <cit> . the more remarkable polymorphism found in 3'rr lies within the hs <dig>  that has the central position in the palindromic structure, on top of the hairpin . we hypothesize that it can influence the modulation of the ig switch through an interaction between the extruded enhancer and peptidic factors. the resulting molecular complexes may affect the mobility of the entire 3'rr and finally the formation of loops joining different constant and variable ig portions. it could be interesting to investigate the role of the variants we have found in differently modulating the ig switch and production in different species, especially in animal models such as macaque and mouse.

CONCLUSIONS
we remark that both coding sequences and wide non-coding regulatory regions have undergone to some evolutionary pressure, and that part of this pressure was aimed to preserve the 3'rr three-dimensional structure for the conservation of the regulatory function necessary for class switch recombination <cit> .
