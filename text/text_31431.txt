BACKGROUND
the carnivorous plant utricularia and its sister genus genlisea  share two anomalous molecular evolutionary features: highly increased rates of nucleotide substitution across the genomes of all three cellular compartments, mitochondrial, plastid, and nuclear  <cit> , and dynamic evolution of genome size at the level of species or even population  <cit> . some species, such as utricularia gibba and genlisea aurea, possess the smallest haploid angiosperm genomes known, at ca.  <dig> and  <dig> megabases , respectively, one-half or even less than that of arabidopsis thaliana , and have bacterial-size chromosomes that vary widely in number between species  <cit> . paradoxically, genlisea also contains species with genomes up to  <dig> mb in size. along with their many physiological and morphological peculiarities, these plants are prime candidates for further research on the complexities of plant physiology associated with carnivory, metagenomic surveys of trap microbial communities, novel plant nitrogen/nutrient utilization pathways, the ecology of prey attraction, whole-plant and trap comparative development, and finally, evolution of the minimal angiosperm genome  <cit> .

with a total of  <dig> species worldwide, utricularia is the largest genus of carnivorous plants  <cit> . the name "bladderwort" refers to the bladder-like suction traps that serve for prey capture. bladders take on many forms within a theme, and their morphologies among species match well with phylogenetic groupings  <cit> . additionally, bladders can appear on almost every surface of the plants' leafy or non-leafy structures, as well as in place of a first embryonic leaf  <cit> . ecologically, the genus comprises predominantly small annual or perennial herbs that occur in three life forms: about 60% of the species are terrestrial, 15% aquatic, and the remaining 25% comprise lithophytes and epiphytes  <cit> . like other carnivorous plants, utricularia are typically inhabitants of nutrient-poor environments, and supplement normal photolithotrophic nutrition by trapping and utilizing prey, typically aquatic crustaceans, mites, rotifers and protozoa  <cit> . previous studies have confirmed nutrient uptake from artificially fed prey in utricularia  <cit> , and it is known that organic carbon , nitrogen  and phosphorus  are prominent targets of prey digestion in carnivorous plants  <cit> . in contrast with other carnivorous plants that acquire carbon from their prey, in some utricularia species photosynthetically absorbed c is secreted into the trap environment  <cit> , suggesting that c supplied into the traps benefits the large associated microbial community, while n and p derived from this community become available for plant uptake in a manner similar to the rhizosphere interactions of terrestrial plants  <cit> . near zero o <dig> in traps of aquatic utricularia species probably determines the type of organisms that can live inside traps, where a captured prey dies of oxygen deprivation  <cit> . digestive extracellular enzymes have been detected on the various trap glands and in the trap fluid  <cit> . it has been proposed that a considerable proportion of enzymatic activity in trap fluid is derived from the commensal organisms that live in utricularia bladders  <cit> . however, determination of enzyme activities does not prove their origin, with some of them possibly encoded in the utricularia genome.

despite considerable interest in the biology of lentibulariaceae, no genomic data is available for these carnivorous plants. massive parallel  <dig> pyrosequencing has become a feasible method for de novo transcriptome sequencing with sufficient depth and coverage to carry out quantitative differential gene expression analysis  <cit> , which has already been efficiently used for large-scale transcriptome sequencing of different plant species  <cit> . with the aim of determining the utricularia transcriptome and report a detailed analysis of the resulting sequences, we sequenced and assembled  <dig>  mpb of utricularia gibba ests. utricularia gibba  is a free-floating, submerged aquatic carnivorous plant with a small genome of about  <dig> mbp  <cit> . this work provides the first broad survey of nuclear genes transcripts in utricularia species, permitting several hypotheses about their physiology and morphology to be assessed. we detail aspects of the u. gibba transcriptome in different organs as well as in plants under physiological stress. particular attention is paid to the expression of genes involved in n and p uptake, hydrolase-related genes expressed during prey digestion, as well as genes involved in respiration and reactive oxygen species  production and scavenging. we also report preliminary sequencing of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and provide analyses of molecular evolutionary rates. finally, using molecular evolutionary analyses and direct experimental methods, we evaluate the hypothesis of albert et al.,  <dig>  <cit> , which postulates that reactive oxygen species  derived from specialized action of cytochrome c oxidase account for increased substitution rates and genome-size dynamism following dna repair.

RESULTS
basic analysis of the utricularia gibba transcriptome
three cdna libraries were generated from rna extracted from different organs of u. gibba plants . additionally, a cdna library from whole plants subjected to multiple physiological stress conditions was generated  . cdna libraries were sequenced in two  <dig> pyrosequencing runs.  <dig>  masked reads were entered into the assembly process . using newbler assembler software  a high proportion of non-assembled reads  was obtained; this fraction represents approximately one quarter of total masked reads . using a different assembly approach that consisted of clustering/assembling procedures, the vast majority of the masked reads  were merged into contigs. the total number of clusters generated was  <dig>  that assembled into  <dig>  contigs, with an average of  <dig>  reads per contig. the length of contigs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, with an average length of  <dig>  bp, suggesting that a significant number of contigs may represent full-length cdnas. the presence of multiple contigs in a cluster could be due to possible alternative transcripts, paralogy or domain sharing. all reads that did not meet the match criteria to be clustered/assembled with any other reads during the clustering/assembling process were defined as singlets. the total number of singlets was  <dig>   with an average length of  <dig>  nucleotides. unique transcripts  from u. gibba were generated by combining  <dig>  assembled contigs and  <dig>  singlets.

u. gibba ut were annotated by searching for sequence similarities using blastx against proteins identified in several available complete plant genomes [arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa, ricinus communis, vitis vinifera , oryza sativa, sorghum bicolor , physcomitrella patens , chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and ostreococcus lucimarinas , all of them downloaded from the refseq database  <cit> . using a cut-off e-value of ≤ 10- <dig> and a bit score ≥  <dig> we found that  <dig>   of u. gibba ut have high identity to at least one plant protein. the high proportion of u. gibba ut with no significant hit  was expected since the likelihood of finding similarity to previously described proteins is highly dependent on the length of the query sequence. this is illustrated by contig versus singlet hits to database proteins; contigs were found to have significant similarity to plant proteins in over 90% of cases, whereas the majority  of singlets bore no similarity to any proteins. it is also possible that many u. gibba ut could not be reliably annotated because they represent untranslated regions  or non-coding rnas . a comparison of u. gibba ut against the u. gibba genome sequence  using blastn shows that  <dig> % of the transcripts have a significant hit against the genome . the remaining sequences probably failed to align because the u. gibba genome is currently represented by a preliminary draft assembly of relatively low coverage .

we determined the proportion of plant proteins for which homology was detected among u. gibba ut. homology was detected to 43% of arabidopsis , 38% of populus , 40% of ricinus , 55% of vitis , 47% of oryza , 38% of sorghum , 30% of physcomitrella , 30% of chlamydomonas  and 47% of ostreococcus proteins . u. gibba ut were similar, at most, to  <dig>  unique plant proteins . this number represents the most stringent underestimation of the minimal number of u. gibba genes found expressed in the organs and conditions sampled in this study.

the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  classifications  <cit>  from best-hit plant proteins were associated to u. gibba ut in order to identify proteins with a known function. proportions of best hits in each kegg category are shown in figure  <dig>  additionally, using the kegg atlas resource  <cit>  we created a global metabolism map combining  <dig> existing pathways, corresponding to  <dig>  genes referenced to in the kegg database for arabidopsis, populus, vitis, ricinus, oryza, sorghum, physcomitrella, chlamydomonas and ostreococcus. this global metabolism map was compared to the global map created for the u. gibba ut, for which  <dig> distinct metabolic pathways could be assigned  out of  <dig> plant metabolic pathways annotated in the kegg atlas. these results indicate that the u. gibba ut comprise a deep representation of the complex metabolic pathways that characterize a plant genome, permitting their use as a source of genomic information to explore the structural, functional, and evolutionary diversity of the lentibulariaceae.

identification of u. gibba transcription factor  families
plants devote ~7% of their genome coding capacity to proteins that regulate transcriptional activities  <cit> . analysis of completed plant genome sequences suggests that over  <dig> transcription factor  families are present in most plant genomes. in arabidopsis  <cit>  and populus trichocarpa  <cit>  the  <dig> tf families vary in size from 1- <dig> members to over  <dig> members. rice contains  <dig> of the  <dig> dicot tf families  <cit> , missing only the sap <dig> family, which is represented by a single gene in both arabidopsis and p. trichocarpa. about ~3%  of the u. gibba ut showed significant homology  to known tfs previously defined in arabidopsis  <cit>  and were similar to a maximum of  <dig> unique tfs. we examined the distribution among the known tf families in vascular plants, and in selected cases, the complexity of u. gibba tf families relative to what is found in other plant species. at least one member for  <dig> of the  <dig> tf families previously identified in vascular plants was identified in u. gibba ut. among the low copy tf families present in other plants, one member of each of the hrt-like, lfy, whirly, s1fa-like and voz families, two members of the bbr-bpc, ccaat-dr <dig>  cpp, gif and mbf <dig> gene families, and  <dig> members of the c2c2-yabby and eil gene families are represented in the u. gibba ut. only the sap <dig>  nzz and ult tf families were not represented among the u. gibba ut .

since u. gibba is a plant that lacks roots, it was possible that genes involved in root development had been lost, contributing to a reduction in genome size. although the transcriptomes would never be a full representation of all genes present in a given genome, interestingly, we found that most of the tfs preferentially expressed in and known to be involved in root development, including homologous proteins to the a. thaliana arfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  aux/iaa proteins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 17; short root and scarecrow  are represented in the u. gibba transcriptome  <cit> . this finding suggests the possibility that the lack of roots in u. gibba may not be due to a preferential loss of genes involved in root development but instead a loss of developmental programs involved in the establishment of the gene expression networks required for root formation.

changes in transcript abundance in the u. gibba transcriptome
each organ-specific transcriptome was significantly sampled, and only a low disparity among the number of reads in each organ was detected . the transcriptome obtained from u. gibba plants exposed to different stresses  was also included in our analysis . a large proportion of the reads  assembled into  <dig>  contigs, each assumed to represent a distinct gene structure. in principle, the number of reads that assemble in a specific contig represents the abundance of mrna produced by a particular gene in a given tissue sample. however, differences in transcript abundance may reflect sampling errors rather than genuine differences in gene expression. in consequence, read counts must be normalized to allow comparison of expression measures across samples, and a common practice is to scale gene counts by library totals  <cit> . recently, however, it has been reported that more general quantile-based procedures yield much better concordance with expression pattern values obtained by qrt-pcr  <cit> . therefore, we decided to normalize read-counts in the r environment  <cit>  using a quantile normalization procedure similar to that described previously by bullard et al.  <dig>  <cit> , which is based on a previously described microarray normalization approach  <cit> . an expression profile matrix was created  containing the number of reads for each of the  <dig>  genes represented by contigs  and four normalized transcriptomes . normalized read counts ranged from 0- <dig> 

to assess the relative abundance of gene transcripts among organ-specific transcriptomes, we applied the statistical r test  <cit> . we considered preferentially expressed genes  to be contigs with r ≥  <dig>  and a 2-fold minimum difference in terms of reads per organ-specific transcriptome as compared against the other sequence sets. a total of  <dig>  u. gibba ut were identified as pegs;  <dig> in flwl,  <dig> in shtl and  <dig> in trpl, some of which could be considered as organ-specific genes because of all reads forming these u. gibba contigs were derived from a single cdna tissue sample . to identify ubiquitously expressed genes we considered only those clusters with at least one read from every library. in this case, all statistical tests were required to have non-significant results . stress responsive genes were identified by comparing the transcriptome obtained from u. gibba stressed plants  against all organ-specific data sets. according to the stringency levels  a total of  <dig> u. gibba ut were identified as differentially expressed genes in response to multiple physiological stresses .

in order to quantify the similarity among organ-specific u. gibba transcriptomes we compared their diversity and specialization using a recently described model based on shannon entropy. diversity  is measured by an adaptation of shannon's formula for entropy of a transcriptome's frequency distribution, while specialization  is estimated as the average specificity of the genes expressed in each organ  <cit> . the estimation of these properties allows the recognition of general differences among the transcriptomes, enhancing the understanding of their distributions. we note that the most specialized organ sampled in u. gibba is the inflorescence, even when the traps, characteristic for the genus, are among the most intricate structures in the plant kingdom and are the organ through which utricularia attract, capture and digest their prey  <cit> . the diversity measures of the three organ classes  group in a region of relatively low diversity . shoots and traps, however, could be considered as extremely similar organs based on their transcriptomes. this is not surprising, however, given that bladders are in fact modified leaves with sensitive bristles on "trap door" entrances  <cit> .

functional classification of differentially expressed genes highlights energy, metabolism, and hydrolases
pegs in a specific organ were classified into functional categories according to the munich information center for protein sequences classification  using the funcat database  <cit>  and an arabidopsis annotation was obtained for u. gibba ut . a venn diagram was constructed to show selected overrepresented categories and their intersections in inflorescences, traps and shoots . as one validation of differential expression in these tissues, among inflorescence pegs, the mips category "tissue differentiation" was significantly over-represented via the subcategory 'flower' . furthermore,  <dig> genes for which expression was considered as peg among the transcriptomes were selected with the aim of validating expression patterns found. in general we found a good correlation  of the expression levels obtained by  <dig> sequencing with those obtained by qrt-pcr .

a noteworthy over-represented mips category identified in shoot and trap peg was "energy". in shoot peg the "energy" mips category is represented by 'photosynthesis' and 'energy conversion and regeneration' subcategories, while in trap peg, this category is represented by 'respiration' and 'electron transport and membrane-associated energy conservation' subcategories . as expected in shoot peg, the u. gibba ut annotated as sbpase  and rubisco small subunit 1b  were identified as over-represented in the "metabolism" mips category  . these results suggest that whereas photosynthesis occurs mainly in the shoot, in traps respiration is the major metabolic activity.

with regard to peg in traps, some u. gibba ut were annotated as hydrolases . these u. gibba ut were: cl12267contig <dig> , cl3763contig <dig> , cl434contig <dig> , cl6134contig <dig>  and cl851contig <dig> . activities for the same five hydrolases have been reported in the fluid collected from traps of four aquatic utricularia species   <cit> .

nitrogen and phosphorous uptake in u. gibba
nitrogen and phosphorous are two essential macronutrient elements for plants, that are often a major constraint for plant growth and reproduction in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. the major forms of these nutrients utilized by plants are nitrate  and phosphate . a number of genes encoding the transporters and channels for nutrient acquisition have been identified and functionally characterized in model species, particularly arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . it has been proposed that phosphorus uptake from prey might be more important than that of nitrogen  <cit> . trap fluid stoichiometry  as well as the presence of nutrient limited microbial cells  indicates the importance of phosphorus rather than nitrogen for the nutrition of utricularia  <cit> . additionally, in u. vulgaris it has been reported that investment in carnivory, calculated as the proportion of leaf biomass and leaf area comprising traps, is inversely proportional to the availability of pi from non-carnivorous sources, whereas n showed no significant effect in the investment in carnivory  <cit> . this is consistent with the notion that phosphorus uptake from prey might be more important than that of nitrogen for utricularia species. a gene encoding an acid phosphatase is the highest expressed among utricularia pegs , and genes encoding three members of the pht <dig> family of high affinity pi transporter were identified as pegs in traps . since the pht <dig> family comprises high-affinity pi strongly expressed in plant roots  <cit> , we suggest that in rootless utricularia pi uptake takes place mainly in the traps  <cit> .

in higher plants there are two types of nitrate transporters, named nrt <dig> and nrt2s   <cit> . microarray experiments have been used to identify additional genes involved in nitrate/nitrite assimilation  <cit> . using this information we identified a total of  <dig> u. gibba ut annotated as homologous to arabidopsis proteins involved in the nitrate assimilation pathway  . most of these genes were found to be ubiquitously expressed in u. gibba, with the exception of the homolog of the arabidopsis chl <dig> gene that was identified among the shoot pegs. chl <dig>  is a ntr <dig> protein that recently has been reported to function as a nitrate sensor in plants  <cit> . additionally we found that three different u. gibba ut annotated as δ-tip  were among the most highly expressed genes in shoot. δ-tip  has recently been reported as an ammonium  transporter, since δ- and γ- tip's  complement the lack of urea transporters in yeast  <cit> . in the bladderwort utricularia vulgaris,  <dig> % of the total nitrogen content has been estimated to come from insect derived nitrogen  <cit> , however, contribution of nitrogen from animal prey is variable in carnivorous plants, with estimates ranging from 10% to 87% dependent on taxa  <cit> . considering the high amino acid identity , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % among the utricularia and arabidopsis tonoplast intrinsic proteins , these results suggest that in aquatic utricularia species, nitrogen uptake, at least in part, could be taking place in shoot  and that urea could be a major n source for aquatic utricularia species.

elevated molecular evolutionary rates in organellar genome blocks and individual nuclear genes
in addition to transcriptome discovery, we sequenced large portions of the plastid and mitochondrial genomes from utricularia gibba as part of our utricularia nuclear genome sequencing project. this has provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate earlier findings on elevated molecular evolutionary rates in utricularia organellar genomes  <cit> . from  <dig>  million u. gibba whole-genome shotgun  sequencing reads   <dig>  high-quality reads were identified as organellar sequences . these reads were assembled using newbler assembler version  <dig> , resulting in  <dig> contigs from chloroplast and  <dig> contigs from mitochondrial genomes with a n <dig> contig size of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp respectively. the largest u. gibba chloroplast contig  corresponds to part of the large single copy region . using a multiple genome comparison and aligment tool  <cit>  we selected a homologous region from  <dig> of  <dig> eudicot  angiosperm chloroplast genomes contained in an organelle genome database  <cit> , this chloroplast region encodes a total of  <dig> coding genes. removal of ambiguously aligned was carried out using gblocks  <cit> , which is designed to identify and remove highly variable regions of alignments where positional homology is dubious . the final clustalw alignment  <cit>  contained  <dig> taxa and  <dig>  nucleotide characters for the fraction of the lsc chloroplast region. for the mitochondrial genome we made a similar analysis as described above for the chloroplast sequences using unambiguously aligned sequences  derived from a mitochondrial contig of  <dig>  nucleotides . a total of four coding genes were identified in this partial sequence of the u. gibba mitochondrial genome. due to the limited number of complete sequences of mitochondrial genomes, phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the homologous region from six eudicot taxa.

neighbornet phylogenetic analysis  <cit>  was used as a simple tool to illustrate both branch length differences among species and incongruence of phylogenetic signal within data sets. analysis of the large block of chloroplast lsc sequence revealed that utricularia gibba has the longest terminal branch of any eudicot sampled . although this relative rate difference is slight, it is statistically significant at p <  <dig>   with respect to jasminum , the sister genus of u. gibba, as analyzed using coffea  as outgroup . elevated evolutionary rate in u. gibba is, however, striking in a rate-sensitive upgma cluster analysis  <cit>  of the same data . upgma assumes a molecular clock operating equally among all species, so deviation from this requirement in terms of obtained branch lengths, and possibly also well-established phylogenetic relationships, provides a useful test for rate asymmetries. accordingly, the plastid dna upgma tree places u. gibba erroneously, separate from asterid taxa to which this species is assuredly most closely related . for the mitochondrial genome, neighbornet analysis , relative rate tests , and upgma clustering  of the available data all demonstrate an enormously elevated substitution rate in utricularia.

given the availability of considerable nuclear transcriptome sequence, we also assayed molecular evolutionary rates across a random set of  <dig> genes homologous to conserved orthologous loci  available for several other asterid species  <cit> . here, we found that u. gibba displayed the longest branch in neighbornet analysis - and therefore the highest relative molecular evolutionary rate - for 92% of these loci. consistently, upgma analyses identified the u. gibba branch as longest in 90% of the  <dig> loci . a concatenated super-matrix comprising all gene sequences for all species produced expected neighbornet  and upgma  results, with u. gibba displaying an elevated molecular evolutionary rate that was significant at p <<  <dig>  with respect to coffea arabica .

carbon, respiration, and reactive oxygen species
analysis of the u. gibba choloroplast and mitochondrial genomes shows that nucleotide substitution rates are elevated in u. gibba. these alterations in substitution rates have been proposed to be related to specific changes in oxidative phosphorylation and excess production of reactive oxygen species . therefore, we analyzed the functional categorization of shoot and trap peg to determine whether they provide molecular support for ox-phos and ros related processes. as previously mentioned, among the prominent over-represented mips category identified in shoot and trap peg was "energy". in shoot peg the "energy" mips category is represented by 'photosynthesis' and 'energy conversion and regeneration' subcategories, while in trap peg, the "energy" category is represented by 'respiration' and 'electron transport and membrane-associated energy conservation' subcategories. correspondingly, utricularia bladders have immensely greater respiration, while exhibiting far lower photosynthetic rates than vegetative tissues  <cit> . interesting in connection, the 'oxygen and radical detoxification' subcategory was prominent among stress peg.

the respiratory chain of mitochondria, normally coupled to electron transport, is one of the main means by which cells gain their energy for performing various activities. electron transport drives a chemiosmotic pump that causes sequestration of protons in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where after these positive charges enter the mitochondrial lumen to catalyze the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate into atp. the rate limiting enzyme of oxidative phosphorylation is cytochrome c oxidase , positioned one step before atp synthase. previous reports showed that, due to changes in specific amino acid positions fixed under positive darwinian selection, cox structure and function might be altered in utricularia and some species of its sister genus, genlisea . hypotheses have been proposed whereby specific changes in these residues  could alter the dissociation kinetics between cox and cytochrome c  <cit>  and possibly produce a conformational change at the active site  <cit> . it has been suggested that the latter process could reversibly decouple proton pumping from electron transport  <cit> . in this way, the intermembrane space could be likened to a capacitor holding enormous positive charge until atp was needed, e.g., to pump water out of traps after their firing. however, storing large quantities of protons could have consequences in the formation of reactive oxygen species  that could be produced by back-up and leakage of electron transport  <cit> . it then follows that the mutagenic action of enhanced ros production  may, as a common cause, explain both the high rates of nucleotide substitution observed in utricularia  and the dynamic evolution of genome size in lentibulariaceae, the latter via non-homologous recombination at double strand breaks  <cit> .

using the funcat database and mips categorization we identified a total of  <dig> annotated u. gibba ut  grouped into the "dna recombination and dna repair" mips subcategory, all of them considered as ubiquitously expressed genes . with regard to the "oxygen and radical detoxification" subcategory,  <dig> u. gibba ut corresponding, at most, to  <dig> arabidopsis unique proteins, some of which  were also expressed ubiquitously . this mips subcategory includes  <dig> proteins involved in glutathione conjugation and peroxidase reactions,  <dig> proteins involved in superoxide metabolism and one catalase. again, expression of these dna repair and ros detox processes is neither trap-specific nor trap-overexpressed, but ubiquitous. however, ros production need not be evenly distributed among organs, which could alter net repair/detox capacity in living tissues.

in order to evaluate ros content in traps versus vegetative organ cells, u. gibba plants were stained with the h2o <dig> specific dye  <dig>  3-diaminobenzidine . dab staining was detected in most cells of vegetative organs  with a considerably higher intensity in the traps , corresponding well to the much greater respiration observed in these structures by adamec  <dig>  <cit> . given the ubiquitous expression patterns in all utricularia organs of genes encoding detoxification enzymes, lower relative ros detoxification is expected in traps and therefore greater toxic effects such as mutagenesis. it is therefore certainly possible that the observed elevated nucleotide substitution rates in utricularia organellar genomes and nuclear genes are due to ros overproduction in the face of net less effective dna repair. although the null expectation would be that all nuclear genes should accrue ros-mediated mutations equally and randomly, 8% out of the  <dig> genes surveyed did not show evidence for an utricularia-specific rate increase. analytical error and/or differential evolutionary conservation of gene sequences in different species could explain this small disparity from 100% expectation. future analyses of nonsynonymous vs. synonymous substitution rates in these cases might reveal the latter phenomenon. with regard to nuclear genome dynamism, detailed studies, e.g., searches for molecular signatures of rampant double strand break repair, must await a high-quality sequence of the entire utricularia gibba genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the utricularia transcriptome provides a detailed genomic window into processes occurring in a carnivorous plant. it contains a deep representation of the complex metabolic pathways that characterize a putative minimal plant genome, permitting its use as a source of genomic information to explore the structural, functional, and evolutionary diversity of the genus. vegetative shoots and traps are the most similar organs by functional classification of their transcriptome, the latter expressing hydrolytic enzymes for prey digestion that were previously thought to be encoded by bacteria. supporting physiological research, traps significantly overexpress genes involved in respiration. other expression data suggests that whereas nitrogen uptake could in part take place in vegetative parts, phosphate uptake might occur mainly in traps. expression of dna repair and ros detoxification enzymes may be indicative of response to increased respiration. finally, evidence from the bladderwort transcriptome, direct measurement of ros in situ, and cross-species comparisons of organellar genomes and multiple nuclear genes supports a hypothesis that increased nucleotide substitution rates throughout the plant may be due to the mutagenic action of amplified ros production.
