BACKGROUND
new intervention strategies are required to detect, prevent and control disease outbreaks. in this context, orthopoxviruses  like variola virus, monkeypox virus and bioengineered opv are often discussed to be potentially used as biological weapons  <cit> . therefore there is general consent that the establishment of a comprehensive pool of antiviral drugs, including substances that inhibit opv replication by mechanisms other than the substances already characterized, is a reliable strategy for treating and preventing smallpox and other opv infections in humans  <cit> .

aptamers promise to be such additional candidates for prophylaxis and treatment of infectious diseases, as they can be directed against a wide variety of target molecules like toxins or even complete microorganisms  <cit> . aptamers are short dna or rna oligonucleotides and, like antibodies, bind to their target by their three-dimensional structure with high affinity and specificity. compared to antibodies, aptamers have several advantages, as they are selected in vitro which also enables selection against toxic or weakly immunogenic targets. dna aptamers are heat and protease resistant without stabilizing modifications. due to chemical synthesis, aptamer production can easily be scaled up  <cit> . during the selection process aptamers with the highest affinity to a target structure are isolated from a pool of oligonucleotides with random positions for nucleic acids, which, depending on the length of the aptamers, contain up to  <dig> different sequence variants, representing a significantly larger pool of variants than antibodies do. in addition to these evident benefits, aptamers exhibit some drawbacks, including their reduced resistance to nucleases and the problem of delivery and clearance in therapeutic application. first attempts to stabilize aptamers were promising  <cit> .

the enrichment procedure that has commonly been used after being first reported in  <dig> was called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment   <cit> . since then, great efforts have been made to improve this method  <cit> , and many different aptamers have been selected by various selex-based protocols for a wide variety of targets ranging from small molecules to whole cells  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit> . some of these aptamers were shown to possess inhibitory activity with certain hiv strains  <cit> , to block cell binding of human cytomegalovirus   <cit>  or influenza virus hemagglutinin  <cit>  or were selected as tools for differentiation of closely related influenza strains  <cit> . recently, the first aptamer-based drug macugen was approved by the fda for treating wet forms of macula degeneration, which is an important step towards the acceptance of aptamers in clinical therapy  <cit> . further drug candidates are under clinical trials  <cit> . finally, an aptamer-based detection device for cocaine already in practical application has been published recently  <cit> .

as an alternative to the selex process with  <dig> to more than  <dig> selection and amplification cycles requiring large amounts of the target molecule, a new selection process was established. based on reports about selecting functional oligonucleotides  <cit>  and the potential of oligonucleotides as non-watson-crick-type binders to peptides and proteins  <cit> , the present study applied this new one-step aptamer isolation protocol  to retrieve dna aptamers that have the potential to bind specifically to opv particles. the monolex approach combined a single affinity chromatography step with subsequent physical segmentation of the affinity resin and one single final exponential amplification step of bound aptamers. a schematic comparison of selex and monolex is given in figure  <dig>  specific aptamers were selected from a combinatory library of oligonucleotides characterized by two flanking primers of known sequence and an internal region of  <dig> random nucleotide positions . under adequate chromatographic conditions, like flow laminarity, sufficient capacity and homogeneity of the resin, high-affinity-binding aptamers stuck to the target, whereas weakly binding oligonucleotides could be removed from the resin by ample washing. since the selection is an in vitro process, depending on the final application of the aptamer, the selection conditions can be adapted accordingly.

RESULTS
identification of high-affinity-binding aptamers by monolex
to select dna aptamers specific for vaccinia virus  as a model for opv, aptamer selection was performed in two steps. an initial chromatography was performed on proteins from virus-free cell culture supernatant to eliminate aptamers binding to cell debris or media components. subsequently, a second chromatography was carried out on resin-bound heat-inactivated vacv particles. for direct recovery of high-affinity-binding aptamers, the resin of the affinity column was physically segmented into slices and the amount of retained binding aptamers was estimated by quantitative real-time pcr. high concentrations of aptamers not eluted during the extended washing procedure were identified on several affinity column segments as indicated by the different grey and colored bars in fig. 2a. indicated column fragments contained aptamer amounts that significantly differed from the background. a subsequent fluorescence curve melting analysis  of the pcr products revealed clearly distinguishable single or double melting peaks for four aptamers which are shown in color in fig 2a. the different melting temperatures observed for these four aptamers indicate different nucleic acid composition of the oligonucleotides retained in distinct positions on the affinity resin . as observed for the two aptamers a <dig> and a <dig> , more than one melting peak suggested the presence of at least two different aptamers with different melting temperatures amplified from one affinity column segment.

the sequences of these aptamers were determined by pyrosequencing as described above. none of the aptamers showed sequence homology to known viral or cellular sequences in the variable region as proven by blast search, neither including nor excluding the flanking primer sequences.

to verify the binding specificity of the identified aptamers, several methods were applied. first, an aptamer blotting assay was performed binding aptamers to heat-inactivated vacv. bound aptamers were quantified using real-time pcr, revealing a significant enrichment of aptamer molecules as indicated by a ct-value shift of  <dig>  in relation to the background without vacv . additional peaks seen in fcma directly after amplification of the aptamers  <dig> and  <dig>  disappeared after the aptamer-blotting assay, resulting in one distinct peak for each aptamer . interestingly, in this step the more prominent peak of a <dig> at 80°c vanished while the less prominent one at 87°c increased significantly in height. this finding implies that co-amplification of two aptamers can result in suppression of one aptamer. this effect is probably caused by significant differences in pcr efficiency when amplifying two aptamers of different composition, but is independent of the aptamer's affinity to the target.

since a <dig> showed the highest antiviral activity to vacv in a preliminary screening, it was chosen for further characterization and binding studies. the a <dig> sequence is tacgactcactatagggatcctgtatatattttgcaactaattgaattccctttagtgagggtt. figure 2d shows the melting profile of the chemically synthesized a <dig> as single peak; its two-dimensional structure under the reaction conditions used as obtained using the m-fold software  <cit>  is presented in the inset.

in vitro-binding studies of a38
binding characteristics of a <dig> to vacv were further validated by dot blot analysis of immobilized vacv particles stained with biotinylated a <dig> . as shown in fig. 3a, a <dig> binds exclusively to vacv particles and not to the non-infected corresponding cell culture supernatant or cytomegalovirus  particles. even in high concentrations of  <dig> nm aptamer, binding is still specific for vacv. the binding to vacv particles was concentration dependent and could no longer be observed for a <dig> concentrations below  <dig> pm.

as shown in fig 3b, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy  confirmed a significant binding of vacv particles in suspension to immobilized a <dig>  the binding was nearly linear for undiluted  and diluted vacv suspensions . the slope was proportional to the virus concentration when the drifting baseline caused by aptamer leakage was considered. the linear slope indicates that the virus concentration was low  and far from the saturation stage. a signal increase could be seen in spite of the extremely low virus concentration for two reasons: firstly, the spr signal depends on the refractive index of the analyte and practically on the mass, which is high for viruses compared with individual proteins. secondly, the virus particle presents the molecular target in multiple copies on its surface, which leads to enhanced binding to the immobilized aptamers. furthermore the results show that neutravidin-binding does not affect the ability of the aptamer to bind vacv particles.

finally, to prove the binding of a <dig> to vacv with both binding partners in solution, corresponding to in vivo conditions, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy  was performed . this technique proved the binding of a <dig> to vacv particles by determination of the diffusion times for tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate -labeled a <dig> and vacv alone and in combination. in detail, the respective diffusion times were  <dig> ±  <dig> μs for free tmr ,  <dig> ±  <dig> μs for tmr-labeled a <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms for tmr-labeled vacv . when non-labeled vacv was added to a solution of tmr-labeled a <dig>  the diffusion time of a <dig> increased to a magnitude similar to the one of tmr-labeled vacv , which was attributable to the binding of a <dig> to vacv. control experiments with cmv  and 200-nm latex beads  mixed with tmr-conjugated a <dig> showed diffusion times identical to those for tmr-labeled a <dig> alone, indicating no binding to both controls. these data prove that fluorescently labeled a <dig> binds specifically only to vacv particles, but not to control particles of similar size.

to prove its biological activity, vacv infection of human hep <dig> cells , simian vero e <dig> cells and primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells was determined in the presence of a <dig> by immunofluorescence assay . at a concentration of  <dig>  μm, a <dig> clearly inhibited the spread of infection in all three cell types. when determining the cell viability under the influence of a <dig> at an equal concentration, it caused no increased cell death or apoptosis as proved by wst- <dig> cell proliferation assays  and annexin v/pi flow cytometric analysis .

the antiviral potency of a <dig> was measured by an endpoint dilution  and immuno-fluorescence-based assay in hep <dig> cells against vacv , followed by determining the ratio of infected/non-infected cells. a <dig> inhibited vacv entry with a 50% inhibitory concentration  value of  <dig>  μm. the antiviral effect exerted by a <dig> was neither due to cytotoxicity nor to induced apoptosis. a <dig> had no significant effect on cell viability in cytotoxicity assays . the compound concentration at which uninfected hep <dig> cell proliferation was inhibited by 50%  was >  <dig> μm, which was above the available synthesized concentration for a <dig>  this resulted in a selective index  of >  <dig>  . a similar antiviral activity of a <dig> could be detected against a broad spectrum of opv-like cowpox virus, ectromelia virus and camelpox virus as shown by ifa, by quantitative real-time pcr of viral dna used as described previously  <cit>  and by virus titration of the corresponding supernatants . reduced virus proliferation could be confirmed in all experiments. taken together, these results demonstrate that a <dig> binds to a target common to all opv, is a potent and specific inhibitor of opv. however, the inhibition of ectromelia virus proliferation was less pronounced.

since a potential therapeutic use of a <dig> in opv infections requires sufficient nuclease resistance of the dna aptamer, a precondition that unmodified rna aptamers often fail to meet, its stability was evaluated by real-time pcr as described above. for that purpose, a <dig> was incubated in serum for  <dig> h at 37°c. as shown by the nearly identical ct values for a <dig> in water and in serum, no significant degradation of a <dig> was detected by quantitative pcr after a 24-h incubation in serum . a <dig> still inhibited virus dissemination after  <dig> days in medium to a degree similar to fresh a <dig>  as confirmed by ifa .

discussion
when the first aptamers were developed  <dig> years ago, it was predicted that they had an enormous potential as a feasible alternative to antibodies. although the application of antibodies for the detection and therapy of infectious agents is well established, aptamers have some potential advantages over antibodies that may fill the gaps that antibody-based applications possess and that expedite the use of aptamers in the virologist's laboratory  <cit> . these advantages include their small size, eased cell penetration, rapid and cheap synthesis including a variety of chemical modifications and the fact that aptamers are non-immunogenic. probably their crucial benefit is a selection process performed in vitro. thus, aptamers can be selected against targets that are either weakly immunogenic or toxic, like toxin proteins  <cit> . these targets are usually not applicable for in vivo production of monoclonal antibodies in mice; however, highly affine aptamers have been selected against some of these problematic targets  <cit> . moreover, the chemical and physical conditions for aptamer selection can be adapted to the real environment in which the aptamer will finally be applied. this includes cross-selection against similar targets that have to be excluded from an aptamer's detection pattern.

with the fda approval of the first aptamer-based drug macugen and the recent publication of an aptamer-based cocaine sensor, aptamers are starting to tap their full potential with the increasing need for additional specific detection tools.

most of the aptamers developed have been selected by selex or modifications of selex. in this study we evaluated a new selection procedure for aptamers. as demonstrated for the selection of opv-specific dna aptamers, the monolex method is a straightforward procedure for the identification of high-affinity aptamers to a target structure of interest. although selex has proven to generate specific aptamers for several targets, monolex can be a valuable alternative for aptamer selection. based on one affinity chromatography, an optimized enrichment of high-affinity aptamers is obtained by physical segmentation of the affinity resin.

the affinity of the bound aptamers is expected to decrease slightly in the direction of the outlet of the column. however, practical experience shows that the oligonucleotides assort in distinct clusters along the column. column segmentation allows a direct desorption of high-affinity aptamers from individual column fragments, preventing their possible loss due to an amplification efficiency lower than that of low-affinity binders. the combination of differently coated affinity chromatography columns allows the depletion of aptamers that may also bind to structures closely related to the target, therefore increasing the specificity of the aptamers selected.

as shown by several analytical techniques, the selected dna aptamer a <dig> possesses a considerable stability in binding to vacv. this binding could not only be demonstrated with immobilized virus particles on a dot blot, but also vice versa with immobilized aptamers as shown by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, a situation found on detection sensors for poxvirus particles. as described among others for hcv  <cit> , a <dig> could be immobilized on sensor surfaces to identify poxvirus particles in complex matrices, as frequently seen in samples suspected to be of bioterrorist origin. the development of such a sensor has already been considered. concerning the therapeutic application of a <dig>  it was also important to prove its binding to opv with both partners in solution. to this end, we performed fcs studies and demonstrated the binding of a <dig> to vacv particles, but not to cmv or latex beads of similar size. while fcs proved to be a reliable and sensitive method to demonstrate aptamer-virus interactions in solution, the binding of a <dig> to vacv-infected cells could not be observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. the reason for this failure is still not clear but may be a problem of sensitivity. although the binding partner of a <dig> on opv particles is still unknown, it must be highly conserved and present on all different opv. the in vitro replication of several opv could significantly be inhibited in the presence of a <dig> in a concentration-dependent manner, with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  μm, a concentration that is in agreement with previously published aptamers specific for other viruses  <cit> . further studies have to evaluate the mechanism of inhibition and the potential to inhibit opv replication in animal models.

CONCLUSIONS
the need for specific diagnostic or therapeutic tools in infectious diseases is obvious. here we present a new selection approach for aptamers, called monolex, and describe the selection of an opv-specific aptamer. according to monolex, the amplification of aptamers from affinity-column segments after complete depletion of low-affinity binders by affinity chromatography might be a fast and reliable technology for isolation of highly affine aptamers. especially in scenarios where infections with new, emerging pathogens have to be detected or treated, a fast technique providing specific detection tools may be helpful. the spectrum for different applications of aptamers like a <dig>  either on a sensor for opv detection or for treatment of infections, requires an extremely high stability of the aptamer. the use of dna aptamers facilitates such a high stability without modifications, even in body fluids.

with the improving automation of the aptamer selection process and the growing knowledge of pathogen-specific targets, the number of aptamers used in diagnostics and therapy of infectious diseases will dramatically increase in the future.
