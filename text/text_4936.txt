BACKGROUND
among the major world crops, sorghum  presents one of the more attractive targets for rapid genetic improvement: high abiotic-stress tolerance, the efficient c <dig> photosynthesis pathway, high genetic diversity, and an available genome sequence. a grass belonging to the andropogonaceae, sorghum ranks fifth among world crops in weight of grain produced  <cit> . while in developed countries its grain and silage are used mainly for cattle feed, in many african, asian, and latin american countries sorghum grain is a staple of human nutrition and the rest of the plant provides feed and fuel. the special importance of sorghum for subsistence farmers in arid and infertile lands is due to its higher level of tolerance to drought and to waterlogging and its more frugal use of soil nitrogen fertilizer than other cereal crops  <cit> . of late the crop has attracted interest for bioenergy production owing to these agronomic advantages, its extravagant biomass production potential, and the availability of sweet sorghums with high sugar concentration in the stem  <cit> .

the relatively small genome size of sorghum , high genetic diversity, diploidy, minimal level of gene duplication facilitating functional assignment, and ability to serve as a model for crops with the c <dig> carbon-fixing metabolism such as maize, pearl millet, and sugar cane, justified its choice as the third plant species to have its genome sequenced. an 8x draft sequence of cultivar btx <dig> was released in  <dig>  <cit> .

prospects for molecular-genetic improvement of sorghum are based on long research into its phenotypic and genetic diversity. as a focus for diversity study, the u.s. sorghum community has created a panel of  <dig> grain-sorghum accessions from diverse geographic and climatic regions, including  <dig> lines generated via backcross conversion of diverse african landraces to short, daylength-insensitive u.s. lines  <cit> , and  <dig> elite grain or forage cultivars and other accessions of genetic or historical importance. the panel accessions were genotyped with  <dig> single-sequence-repeat  markers  <cit>  for a preliminary assessment of diversity patterns of relevance to association mapping. in a second study  <cit>  the panel was genotyped at selected loci surrounding two dwarfing genes for fine-mapping by association.

the primary target in variation studies has come to be single-nucleotide polymorphisms or snps. while these can be mined from existing sequence databases  <cit> , recent advances in high-throughput dna sequencing   <cit>  have made possible the direct characterization, at steadily decreasing cost, of all the nucleotide-level variation present between individuals of a species, only a fraction of which is accessible to conventional genetic markers. current technologies yield reads of  <dig> to more than  <dig> bases, in gigabase quantities per sequencing run. snps are identified by comparison of sequence reads between two or more accessions. availability of a reference genome sequence both speeds this resequencing operation and allows genomic mapping of polymorphisms. when a reference sequence is not available, a common practice is to assemble reads into contigs and align all reads against them  <cit> .

for relatively small genomes, snp discovery and even genotyping  <cit>  can be accomplished by whole-genome sequencing. for large genomes, whether or not a reference sequence is available, much of the sequence thus collected will be repetitive and of little value for polymorphism discovery, while the gene space will be only shallowly sampled. "reduced-representation" or "genomic-reduction" approaches seek to reduce the extent of the sampled region and to enhance the sampling of gene regions. they have taken several forms including est sequencing  <cit> , methylation digestion  <cit> , and restriction-fragment-size-based sampling  <cit> . the restriction-site associated dna  approach  <cit>  involves constructing a sequencing library from only genomic dna fragments whose 5' ends abut the recognition site of a selected restriction enzyme. the choice of enzyme allows tuning the numbers of sites assayed, while read labeling by attachment of short dna identifying sequences known as multiplex identifiers , or "bar codes" allows tuning the depth of coverage according to the number of individuals pooled in the same sequencing reaction.

the throughput and economy of hts renders increasingly attractive the prospect of genomewide snp genotyping without the development of individual snp assays or dedicated hybridization chips. recent applications of "genotyping by sequencing"  produced massive snp genotype sets for hundreds of rice accessions  <cit>  and a 150-line biparental mapping population  <cit>  via a strategy relying on shallow multiplex sequencing of bar-coded dnas. the incomplete snp haplotypes of the component individuals were then completed by computational imputation of missing genotypes and of recombination breakpoints based on haplotype information from the nonmissing data. most current snp imputation methods focus on methods applied in high-density human snp-typing studies, where a reference panel may be available but where phase inference is a source of error  <cit> . in the two large plant studies cited above, genotype reconstruction from partial data was accurate to above 95%, in the one partly because in inbred individuals phasing is obviated, and in the other owing to the defined linkage disequilibrium of the biparental population. but in the still-young field of plant gbs, snp genotype inference has not been evaluated in smaller accession panels, and reference panels are not yet available.

validation of putative snps generated in a small germplasm panel is often incomplete because of the expense of exhaustive confirmatory assays. unless sequencing is done to high coverage, commonly a small set of snp candidates is selected for confirmation by sanger sequencing or hybridization assays. an average of 5× coverage per maize accession yielded a confirmation rate of 95% of  <dig> tested snps  <cit> , while 45× coverage in rice yielded in two different genomes  <dig> and 95% confirmation of  <dig> snps via a designed snp array  <cit> . in soybean  <cit>  confirmation rates were only  <dig> to 85%, with the higher rate, corresponding to more stringent test criteria, reducing by fivefold the number of snps called. a false-discovery rate of 15% was reported for another maize snp-discovery experiment  <cit> , but this study was conducted without a reference genome and faced the problem of computationally distinguishing paralogous from allelic snps in an ancestral tetraploid. another soybean study  <cit> , using several snp prefiltering criteria including 80× sequencing of another reference genome, reported false-positive and -negative rates of  <dig>  and  <dig> %. the latter useful statistic, quantifying the proportion of snps missed by a method, is not always reported; confirmation rates of up to 97% in soybean and rice were reported by  <cit> , but without mention of the accompanying false-negative rate. as a rule confirmation rates depend heavily on the initial filtering algorithm used to declare snp candidates, since many unfiltered snp candidates are sequencing errors.

the expected density of snps in plant genomes is relevant to their utility for further genetic studies. in the few plant species subjected to large-scale snp exploration by hts, snp density has been reported to range from  <dig> bases per snp in rice  <cit>  to  <dig> in maize  <cit> ,  <dig> in soybean genes  <cit> , and  <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . but density will vary with genome region, depth of sequencing coverage, and choice of sampled accessions as well as with the breeding system of the species.

the aim of the study reported here was the sequencing, to sufficient depth for discovery of a set of  <dig>  to  <dig>  snps, of a representative set of grain-sorghum accessions from the panel described above. in the process it became of interest to examine the parameters that affect the potential efficiency of reduced multiplex sequencing and genotype imputation. the longer-term purpose is to generate a foundation for wider allelic exploration of sorghum germplasm resources and to develop a finer-scale picture of the genetic variation present in this and other sorghum germplasm collections that will support the search for alleles of value for sorghum breeding.

RESULTS
sequencing summary
from the three dna libraries 247m reads of length varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bases were obtained . these yielded about  <dig> genome equivalents  of uniquely alignable sequence  covering slightly more than a third of the sorghum genome . the rad libraries gave about a 15-fold better coverage depth in the sampled genomic region than the semirandom  library , based on equal numbers of uniquely aligning reads accepted after quality filtering. the generally higher quality of reads from the rad than from the sr library was not considered in this comparison, since library construction and sequencing were done at different times by different laboratories.

*semirandom

the rad library unique alignments were more enriched for genic regions than those from the sr library . while about 15% of the genome is annotated as genic, 38% of rad_p and 34% of rad_b reads came from genic regions, in contrast to 28% of sr-library reads.

restriction-site coverage by reads from rad libraries
cumulative coverage of restriction sites by reads approached plateaus at about 73%  and 57%  of in silico restriction sites . since about 86% of reads sampled in silico from psti or bsrfi restriction sites could be aligned uniquely to the genome, it appears that 13% to 29% of sites were not sampled by rad library preparation. the in-silico study showed that the nonsampled restriction sites were not disproportionately associated with short fragment lengths , hinting at a biological rather than a library-preparation cause.

the rad technology also sampled other genomic sites than intended. about 12% of unique alignments of rad_b and 19% of rad_p reads were to positions other than the canonical restriction sites  of the respective enzyme . the alignment positions of these reads originating at noncanonical restriction sites  appeared to be randomly distributed with respect to the crs. however, more than half of ncrs in rad_b reads fell within  <dig> bases of a crs, and the genomic regions covered by the two kinds of reads overlapped by up to 40%, depending on the accession and rad library. of the >  <dig> different  <dig> b sequences at the starts of the ncrs-reads in rad_b, 27% showed pattern yccggr, resembling the canonical bsrfi recognition sequence rccggy. no evident rule governed the accession-coverage frequencies of specific ncrs sequences. the contrasts between accession-coverage frequencies for the two kinds of read origin were very similar for the two rad libraries , with large numbers of ncrs sites represented in only one accession but many crs sites represented in all of the accessions.

nucleotide variant characteristics
over all three libraries,  <dig> k candidate snps passed the novoalign snp filter, in contrast to  <dig> k snps called from soap <dig> alignments based on a simple filter requiring ≥  <dig> alternative calls with average alternative-allele base-quality score ≥  <dig>  in the sanger validation sequencing, the  <dig> snps confirmed in the reads covering the validation set included  <dig>  of the  <dig> soap <dig> and  <dig>  of the  <dig> novoalign candidates. the recall proportion or fraction of true snps called correctly  thus favored the novoalign criteria  over the simple filter . "snp" will in this report accordingly denote candidate snps with a novoalign score of at least  <dig> and thus at least 82% confirmation probability. this level of uncertainty should be borne in mind in assessing quantitative snp characteristics to be described below, though we suggest that it has little influence on bulk genome- or accession-related distributional properties of snps and their alleles. the inverse relationship between confirmation rate and novoalign quality threshold as applied to the entire snp set is shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  no heterozygous snps were identified in the validation set.

in rad libraries, crs and ncrs reads showed very different characteristics, as would be expected from the semirandomly positioned genomic origin of the latter. of snps identified in rad sequences, up to one third were in ncrs reads . for the rad libraries, the accession coverage of snps in crs and ncrs reads showed  the same extreme difference as seen for the read start sites, with the crs heavily weighted towards coverage of all eight accessions and the ncrs towards occurrence mainly in individual accessions. the apparent exception to the latter rule seen for ncrs reads in the figure is discussed later. reads from the sr library also gave little common coverage in multiple accessions , showing that the hpaii methylation-sensitive digestion and size separation used as a preparation step did not confer detectable complexity reduction for read sampling and snp discovery

the effectiveness of the rad approach in focusing sequencing on a limited number of sites was reflected in the result that only half of the snps from the sr library but 80% of those from rad libraries were covered by reads in at least  <dig> of  <dig> accessions, even with the lower sequencing coverage in the rad libraries shown in figure 1b. corresponding to this difference, the rad libraries showed only 20%  and 28%  missing snp genotype calls in comparison with 50% from the sr library. noteworthy in the genotype frequencies over the  <dig> k snps from the union of the rad and sr libraries  are the relatively high heterozygosity in sb <dig> , sb <dig>  sb <dig>  and sb <dig>  the higher representation of sb <dig> mentioned above, and the near-identity of sb <dig>  to the btx <dig> reference.

a further consequence of rad enrichment was the more rapid saturation of snp genotypes with increasing numbers of reads . in test accessions sb <dig> and sb <dig>  a random sample of around half of the reads produced nearly 80% of the snp genotypes called in the full data.

indels accounted for 17% of the polymorphism types. of the  <dig>  indels of length  <dig> to  <dig> bp , 80% were  <dig> to  <dig> bp long. indel density followed snp density over the genome . the log distribution of indels by accession frequency formed a linear figure  matching that of snp alternative-allele frequency.

genome distribution and functional characteristics of nucleotide variation
polymorphism showed strong spatial patterning across sorghum chromosomes , with highest polymorphism focused at ends of chromosomes and lowest in regions annotated as repetitive. the densities of snps and indels were similar in all genomic feature classes . however, the size distribution of indels was highly nonuniform across feature classes, and favored multiples of  <dig> in exons with respect to intergenic regions .

the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous snps varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  across the libraries, and that of transition to transversion for candidate snps from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

of  <dig> k exonic snps,  <dig> were large-effect snps and were present in  <dig> % of annotated sorghum genes. large-effect snps were concentrated in families associated with signaling and molecular recognition functions .

accession diversity
in terms of pairwise relative snp density, the noncultivated propinquum sb <dig> and subspecies verticilliflorum sb <dig> showed highest divergence from the other accessions, while sb <dig> showed the expected high concordance with the btx <dig> reference . snp density between accessions was uniformly higher than that between accessions and the reference. both rad libraries gave similar diversity statistics, while the sr library showed the same trend but with much lower densities.

about half of all snps were represented by a single alternative allele . of these half were accounted for by the noncultivated accessions sb <dig> and sb <dig>  making one fourth of the snps due solely to these two accessions. the corresponding skewing towards rare alleles of the site-frequency spectrum in comparison with that expected under the infinite-sites mutation model with no selection  <cit>  is not surprising in view of the heterogeneous origins and cultivation histories of the accessions. the near-zero frequency of snps with alternative  alleles in all  <dig> accessions follows from the rarity of these alleles in sb <dig> 

plots of haplotype sharing  reveal concentrations of shared alleles in certain genomic regions. they also highlight the distinctness of the two noncultivated accessions from the remainder. no indication of continuous tracts of heterozygosity, or of snps at which heterozygosity was shared between different accessions, was found.

snp genotype imputation and factors affecting accuracy
average imputation accuracy for any given library depended not on its size but on the completeness and accession balance of its snp genotype data . though the rad libraries accounted for only 70% of the combined snps, accuracy exceeded that in the full set. the crs snps from the rad_b library could be imputed to 80% accuracy, but the ncrs to only 65%. imputation accuracy was unchanged even in subsamples of as few as  <dig>  of the snps.

the window size yielding the highest imputation accuracy was  <dig> to  <dig> bases on either side of the target locus. at window size  <dig>  all missing genotypes were imputed as the reference allele for an overall correct-call rate  of  <dig> , while at the optimum window size, the overall accuracy was  <dig> , well above the average similarity of  <dig>  between accessions. in agreement with this result, the imputation accuracy for any individual accession exceeded by  <dig>  on average the maximum genomic similarity between that accession and any other accession . computing imputation accuracy for every subset of accessions showed that accuracy was much more dependent on within-panel similarity than on numbers of accessions in the panel .

discussion
comparison with prior plant snp reports
frequencies of types of nucleotide variation in sorghum were similar to those in other plant species. in six soybean accessions  <cit>  very similar indel fractions and length distributions were reported. those authors mentioned the higher proportion of 3-multiple indels in exons , while in six resequenced elite maize inbreds  <cit>  the same phenomenon can be seen if ratios of the coding sequences  to the intron indel frequencies found in their table s <dig> are plotted. presumably frame-nonshifting are better tolerated than frameshifting indels. snp transition/transversion ratios of around  <dig>  were also similar in this soybean study as in arabidopsis  <cit> . nonsynonymous-to-synonymous-substitution ratios of about  <dig>  were similar to those in arabidopsis but much lower than the  <dig>  reported for soybean by  <cit>  or  <dig>  in rice  <cit> . the declining linear trend of log indel or snp alternative-allele frequency when plotted against the number of accessions in which the indel or snp appeared has not been examined in other plant-species panels, but likely depends on the choice of germplasm. the original intention of the plot was to suggest gene presence—absence variation  in a less completely sequenced panel than that of maize in  <cit> , but it implies that such variation is no different from that of individual snps, suggesting that pav may be rarer in our sorghum panel than in the maize panel.

the functional gene families found to be richest in large-effect snps and the 6% of genes involved were similar to those reported in arabidopsis, 9% of genes  <cit> , rice, 3%  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and soybean, 10%  <cit> , with enrichment in trafficking, messenger, detoxification, and biotic and abiotic-stress-response functions, notably lrr-containing genes implicated in defense response to pathogens. it was suggested by  <cit>  that such high variation is in accord with rapid gene evolution in response to disease pressure.

the location of highest snp densities toward sorghum chromosome ends rather than centromeres is similar to that in maize  <cit>  but differs somewhat from that in arabidopsis  <cit> . this result may trace to the more complete arabidopsis assembly, the lower repetitive-dna content and its altered genomic distribution, and the difference in genome sampling associated with the array-hybridization approach used for that study. repetitive sequence near centromeres and telomeres, possibly coupled with missing genomic data owing to the difficulty of assembly in these regions, interferes with unique alignments.

haplotype comparison is useful for identifying larger genomic tracts differentiating accessions or marking historical introgressions as in rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> , or for assessing patterns of linkage disequilibrium as in soybean  <cit> . the patterns of haplotype-block sharing in these eight accessions are clearly not random and suggest that in larger sorghum germplasm panels, reliable identification of correspondences with adaptively important genes will be possible.

comparison of rad with semirandom sequencing for snp discovery and genotyping
the comparisons between rad and sr sequencing results presented here do not represent a rigorous side-by-side comparison of two library-preparation methods. indeed, the rad approach was adopted only after the inefficiency of the sr approach for our purposes, simultaneous snp discovery and genotyping, became evident. while our results allow no direct comparison of rad with other genomic-reduction methods nor of the selected rad enzymes with the hpaii used for the sr library, they illustrate the advantages of genomic reduction for goals other than enriched gene sequencing.

the adoption of rad for snp exploration or genotyping over hybridization or other high-throughput genotyping approaches will depend on the genome, the selection of enzymes, and the laboratory resources available. semirandom sampling of sorghum sequences led to shallow coverage, by uniquely aligning reads, of one third of the genome, the same proportion as is classed  <cit>  as nonrepetitive. while the rad approach intensified the sampling of a smaller portion  of the genome, improvement was less than expected for two reasons. first, rad sampling to near saturation did not cover the available restriction sites to the extent predicted in silico. we speculate that systematic cytosine methylation or inefficient cleavage in some restriction sites common to all of the sorghum accessions led to incomplete digestion. second, one in five to eight rad reads originated in genomic motifs not matching the canonical recognition sequences of the enzymes. that pcr amplification during library preparation still took place suggests that nonspecific primer binding occurred. while the partially random sequencing that resulted still yielded snps, their unsystematic coverage reduced the reliability of snp-genotype imputation, a key consideration for gbs. to summarize the comparison, 1) about twice as much polymorphism per sequencing outlay was realized by a rad approach to the same genomic material; 2) the same polymorphisms will be genotyped in other sorghum germplasm sequenced from similarly prepared libraries, in sharp contrast to the situation under sr sequencing; and 3) owing to the much more favorable accession distribution of snp coverage, imputation is more effective in compensating for partial sequencing. the possible shortcomings of the rad technology, at least for the two restriction enzymes used here, may be remediable by the use of appropriate digestion buffers  as well as the use of different enzymes and close attention to possible contamination from nonspecific dnases. though wasteful, enzyme "leakage"  did not reduce genotyping efficiency to the level of the sr library because of a degree of overlap of the ncrs and crs reads. this is seen in the u-shaped coverage patterns of figure  <dig>  where ncrs sites as well as snps occur presumably on reads containing crs sites sampled in all accessions.

practical application
while the resampling experiment suggested that halving sequencing coverage of the rad_b library would sacrifice only one fifth of the snps with no loss in imputation accuracy, this estimate is conservative. practical genotyping will be applied to much larger samples than our seven . the worst-imputed genotypes will be in the most divergent accessions, but even in those, local haplotype similarity allows recovery of missing data. the observation that numbers of genomes in the imputation set are much less important in determining imputation accuracy than intergenome similarity implies that an effective strategy for accurate gbs of diverse germplasm panels will be to construct them of groups of at least two members that are predicted to share  <dig> to 90% snp similarity. in this way, those loci not sampled in one entry will be accurately imputed if they have been sampled in one of the most similar entries. in our small panel and experimental conditions, the presence of the two wild accessions with similarity neither to each other nor to the cultivated sorghums reduced overall imputation accuracy by 5%. an additional advantage will be realized by the inclusion of multiple reference sequences in the imputation set.

why did imputation accuracy decline when the sr library was included, even though this library augmented the snp set by 50%? regardless of the similarity structure of a panel, the imputation algorithm could assign to a missing snp in a target accession a genotype only from an accession that possessed one at the target locus. when many of the snp loci have been defined in only one accession, as in the sb2-skewed read set from the sr library, this accession will usually not be the one most similar to the target accession. since about half of the snps in this set were identified in sb <dig>  this accession and the reference were the only accessions available for imputation at many of the snps. the resulting imputation error rate was governed by their average genomewide similarity to the other accessions .

some estimates of the genetic diversity in our panel may be made by modest extrapolation. the common pairwise genomic coverage achieved by rad sequencing revealed about  <dig>  polymorphisms between each accession pair. extending the calculated pairwise snp density to the approximately one third of the sorghum genome that is uniquely alignable suggests that sb <dig> differs from btx <dig> at around  <dig>  and sb <dig> at nearly  <dig>  snps. interestingly, by this calculation our sb <dig>  nominally identical to btx <dig>  differs from that accession at  <dig>  snps, of which  <dig> are expected to be genuine. the proportions of this polymorphism attributable to sequencing or assembly error versus real variation in this accession are unknown, but similar or greater snp divergence between nominally identical inbred accessions is not novel  <cit> .

the above estimates of polymorphism are conservative. the novoalign algorithm, giving false positives in 18% of calls made at the adopted threshold, failed to call 9% of the confirmed snps in the validation set, with  <dig> of the  <dig> recall failures due to insufficient coverage depth. though the samtools algorithm gave snp calls of higher precision and recall than simple depth and quality rules, it is likely that with the high simultaneous coverage afforded by restriction-mediated enrichment, its predictions could be refined by combined evaluation of all accessions for a snp.

the imputation algorithm we applied, though shown by its developers to be competitive with  more elaborate algorithms, was not designed for the shallow genotyping intensity we contemplate. in a larger set of accessions, imputation rates are likely to be improved by procedures modeling the local haplotype neighborhood of the target accession and not only its haplotype similarity to other accessions. it may also be expected that, as in human diversity studies, reference panels genotyped for many snps not necessarily shared by the research set come into use for sorghum and other crops.

CONCLUSIONS
our focus in this study has been to clarify parameters likely to govern deep and wide genotyping of plants for applied as well as basic-research purposes. areas of future research interest suggested by our findings might be: the long- and short-term evolutionary bases for the haplotype patterns observed in our germplasm panel; the reasons for the incomplete sampling of genomic restriction sites and their possible functional basis; the gain and loss of larger genomic tracts, from one germplasm accession to the next, than the short indels we have characterized; and efficient algorithms for snp-genotype completion in the presence of large quantities of missing data.

the sorghum snp and indel data have been deposited in dbsnp under handle jcnlab_ksu, with accession-number ranges starting at  <dig>  and  <dig> .
