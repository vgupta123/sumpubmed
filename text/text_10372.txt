BACKGROUND
crown gall  and root lesion nematode  infestations present a serious challenge to the walnut industry. these problems have resulted in unsalable nursery stock, lower productivity, and increased susceptibility of infected plants to biotic and abiotic stresses. root lesion nematode is a migratory endoparasite that feeds on the roots of many perennial plants, including fruit and nut trees. in california, it is an important pest of walnut, as all existing walnut rootstocks are susceptible or have incomplete resistance  <cit> . current nematode control strategies include nematicides, crop rotation, and tolerant cultivars, but each has serious limitations. crown gall disease is caused by the soil bacterium a. tumefaciens. at present, crown gall disease is managed using surgical removal of the gall and infected tissues or by complete excavation of the diseased tree  <cit> . this is costly and time-consuming, especially when many trees are infected. as in many crops, either natural crown gall and p. vulnus resistance is unavailable to walnut breeders or progress by this approach is slow. thus, stacking resistance genes using genetic technology is an attractive option to more quickly gain control of this disease and pest problem in walnuts.

rna interference  is a functional genomics tool that has been used successfully for plant-parasitic nematode control  <cit> . rnai is a process in which double-stranded rna  triggers the silencing of specific target genes through mrna degradation. rnai has been tested in many organisms including mammals, insects, fungi, and plants  <cit> . rnai-induced suppression of many genes is essential for nematode development, reproduction, or parasitism. in c. elegans, rnai can be induced by exogenous dsrna  introduced via soaking, microinjection, or by feeding of dsrna  <cit> . this rnai technology, and c. elegans genome sequencing, now provides new opportunities for new research on plant parasitic nematodes.

rnai has successfully controlled plant parasitic nematodes such as cyst nematodes  <cit> , root-knot nematodes  <cit> , and recently root lesion nematodes  <cit> . delivery of dsrna to nematode juveniles via soaking has been used successfully to investigate the functions of some genes in cyst nematodes , root-knot nematodes , and migratory nematodes   <cit> . recently, this technique was used to control rlns p. thornei and p. zeae <cit> . there is evidence that plant-delivered sirna/dsrna reduces nematode establishment and development  <cit> . however, there are very few published works to show whether rlns like p. vulnus are also controlled using rnai.

we used self-complimentary constructs based on iaam and ipt genes from a. tumefaciens and the pv <dig>  gene from p. vulnus and an agrobacterium rhizogenes vector to stack rnai mediated resistance to both crown gall and nematode into walnut. control of crown gall disease alone using rnai was successfully achieved previously  <cit> . pv <dig> was targeted based on its similarity to a c. elegans gene whose expression reduces fecundity. pv <dig> is orthologous to the c. elegans prp- <dig> gene, a spliceosome subunit whose rnai phenotype includes a sterility or juvenile lethality in c. elegans <cit> . pv <dig>  was used as a negative control, since its c. elegans orthologs have wild-type rnai phenotypes. based on the c. elegans ortholog ttr- <dig> rnai phenotype , it was predicted that pv <dig> rnai should not reduce nematode populations. agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation was used to insert the crown gall rnai  <cit>  and p. vulnus rnai  <cit>  constructs into walnut somatic embryos. transformed somatic embryos were germinated and roots were challenged with p. vulnus. nematode multiplication was examined  <dig> days after infection. transformed microshoots were challenged with virulent a. tumefaciens strain 20w-5a  <cit> . these genetically modified nematode- and crown gall-resistant walnut plants could help reduce the demand for environmentally harmful nematicides.

RESULTS
creation and selection of somatic embryo lines expressing transgenes
agrobacterium inoculated embryos that remained alive during seven weeks of selection on kanamycin-containing media were tested further to confirm transformation. their transgenic nature was confirmed using gus assay and pcr. some j <dig> and rr <dig> co-transformed lines were positive for both nptii and pv <dig>  the 1: <dig> cg:pv <dig> ratio produced a higher co-transformation efficiency than the 1: <dig> ratio. when only one bacterial strain was used for transformation, 72% of the embryos were positive for the pv <dig> gene and 92% were positive for the pv <dig> gene . j <dig> and rr <dig> transgenic lines and their genotypes determined by pcr are listed in table  <dig>

transgenic plant challenge with root lesion nematodes
a rapid screening method was used to test for nematode resistance in both co-transformed and single-vector transformed transgenic lines. the nematode population supported by each transgenic line was compared to untransformed  and transgenic  controls. results of these trials are shown in the figures below .

the two controls  and line 66-1- <dig> were not significantly different in number of nematodes per root. transgenic line 68-3- <dig> supported up to 79% fewer nematodes per root following in vitro co-culture than untransformed controls. invitro grown roots of this line showed no visible damage due to nematode feeding after two months . lines 33-3- <dig> and 73-2- <dig> supported ~32% and ~36% fewer nematodes than the control nematode population, respectively. the least effective line, 66-1- <dig>  still had ~10% fewer nematodes than the control nematode population . roots tips of line  <dig> showed damage from nematode feeding and had less growth . rr <dig> transgenic lines had 79-84% fewer nematodes per root than the untransformed rr <dig> control . out of the five single-vector transformed lines tested, three lines  controlled the nematode population completely . two other lines had ~64%  and ~91%  fewer nematodes relative to the untransformed control  and no visible damage was observed in these roots  while untransformed roots had damaged, undeveloped, and blackened roots .

these results show that independent of the rolabc genes inserted into the co-transformed lines, the pv <dig> gene effectively controlled nematodes up to 79% in co-transformed lines and 100% in single-vector transformed lines. rolabc genes were introduced into the embryos by the resident t-dna in the a. rhizogenes ri-plasmid used as a vector for plant transformation. in the single-vector transformed lines, there were no rolabc genes inserted with the plasmid as a. tumefaciens does not carry them.

crown gall challenge bioassay
oncogene  silencing was screened phenotypically following in vitro application of a. tumefaciens to sixteen microshoots generated from transformed line 33-3- <dig> or untransformed controls. the amount of undifferentiated callus forming on these tissues after inoculation with virulent a. tumefaciens strain 20w-5a was assayed five weeks post-inoculation . untransformed controls formed galls on  <dig> of  <dig> microshoots inoculated whereas no galls were formed on shoots of the transformed line  <dig>  control lines developed green callus at inoculation sites after five weeks. to confirm that this callus was crown gall tissue, small pieces were cultured further on hormone-free dkw medium. while most walnut tissues  will not proliferate on this medium, crown gall tissue is capable of rapid hormone-independent growth. callus excised from controls displayed vigorous hormone-independent expansion while callus excised from line  <dig> displayed only minimal growth . these results indicate crown gall initiation and proliferation is suppressed in transgenic line  <dig> 

plant genotype and morphological changes
co-transformation resulted in  <dig> stable transgenic lines stacked with gus, nptii, pv <dig>  iaam and ipt, and rolabc  in walnut rootstock backgrounds j <dig> and rr <dig>  the plants transformed with only pv <dig> and pv <dig> genes did not obtain rol genes but gus, nptii, pv <dig> or pv <dig> in rootstock backgrounds j <dig> . to see whether co-transformation changed the phenotype of transformants, the morphology of in vitro-grown microshoots of transgenic lines was compared to untransformed microshoots. shoot height, internode length, leaf size, and leaf appearance were assessed. major morphological differences were observed in shoots generated using the a. rhizogenes vector, including stunted growth, shorter internode length, and dark green, small, wrinkled leaves. this was especially apparent in line 33-3- <dig> . similarly, root growth patterns and root length of transgenic and untransformed in vitro-grown plantlets were compared. all co-transformed roots had 2– <dig>  times greater root diameters than untransformed lines. shoots and roots obtained from single-vector transformation were similar in phenotype to untransformed plants .

discussion
“gene stacking” was used to generate transgenic walnut lines resistant to both nematodes and crown gall infection. crown gall resistance has been achieved previously in walnut using the self-complementary pde <dig>  expression cassette and somatic embryos as explants  <cit> . we used the same vector in co-transformations to produce transgenic line 33-3- <dig>  which exhibited both complete suppression of crown gall and 32% fewer nematodes than untransformed control. co-transformations were designed to suppress expression of both the oncogenes iaam and ipt and the p. vulnus gene pv <dig> through rna interference. stacking crown gall rnai genes in combination with a nematode rnai gene proved a promising way to obtain resistance to both pathogens in walnut. several co-transformed transgenic j <dig> and rr <dig> lines were recovered that showed resistance to both crown gall and nematodes. a similar inhibition by gene-silencing was observed recently in rlns p. thornei and p. zeae grown in carrot mini discs and exposed to double-stranded rna via soaking. silencing of the pat- <dig> and unc- <dig> genes of p. thornei reduced reproduction by 77–81%  <cit> . our results suggest a 1: <dig> concentration ratio is optimal for co-transforming walnut somatic embryos. when we employed conventional transformation using only one vector, we obtained much higher transformation efficiency. absence of competition during transformation likely accounts for this elevated efficiency.

this research represents the first rnai experiments involving a migratory plant parasitic nematode, p. vulnus, by artificial feeding on transgenic walnut roots. in the experiments described here, nematodes were isolated after two months of feeding on the transformed walnut roots. several co-transformed and single-vector transformed walnut roots were used for feeding experiments. in co-transformed lines only, rolabc genes were introduced by the resident t-dna in the a. rhizogenes ri-plasmid used as a vector for plant transformation but not in the single-vector transformed lines with only pv <dig>  in this research, rnai was used as a tool to suppress specific p. vulnus genes. the pv <dig> gene sequence was chosen for these rnai experiments based on its similarity to a c. elegans gene  whose expression has been successfully suppressed in multiple experiments, resulting in reduced fecundity  relative to untreated nematodes  <cit> . pv <dig> gene was chosen for its potential to act as a negative control because rnai silencing of its c. elegans ortholog  has resulted in wild-type phenotype. in migratory nematodes such as p. vulnus, the major observable phenotype is population growth, which is related to the nematodes’ fecundity and ability to feed. all motile stages  feed on plant cells. although juvenile stages may feed ectoparasitically on root hairs, once the nematode has penetrated the root, feeding is restricted almost entirely to the root cortex  <cit> . any paralysis or immobility will affect their feeding ability and subsequent survival or reproduction in a host. interestingly, the c. elegans ortholog of pv <dig> is a spliceosome subunit  with rnai phenotypes including sterility and embryo/larval lethality  <cit> . after observing similar phenotypes in p. vulnus, we can infer that this function is conserved across nematode taxa. however, the prp- <dig> sequence is sufficiently dissimilar to that of plant splicing factors that no detrimental phenotype was observed in the transformed walnut roots.

more work is needed to determine whether the expressed rna has interfered with juvenile development  or with egg production. independent of the transformation method, when dsrna was present we obtained successful nematode control in some transgenic lines, suggesting that silencing the pv <dig> gene orthologous to c. elegans prp- <dig> is very effective in controlling root lesion nematodes. when the pv <dig> rnai construct alone was transformed into walnut, at least three transgenic lines showed even higher pv <dig> gene expression than line  <dig> and equal or better control of nematodes.

all virulent a. rhizogenes strains possess a large root-inducing  plasmid  <cit>  which introduces rol genes when used for transformation. pcr confirmed the insertion of rol genes into co-transformed embryos lines. our nematode assay results show that, independent of the rolabc genes inserted into co-transformed lines, we obtained up to 79% nematode reduction in co-transformed lines and up to 100% reduction in three single-vector transformed lines. even though rolabc genes are present in the roots of co-transformed lines and changed root morphology, these rol genes do not affect nematode feeding. while there is some evidence of altered rooting characteristics in transgenic fruit trees expressing rolabc genes  <cit> , there is no evidence that rol genes affect rln control in walnuts. this is demonstrated by having a higher nematode population in line 66-1- <dig> which is a co-transformed j <dig> transgenic line possessing iaam, ipt, pv <dig> and rolabc genes. line 66-1- <dig> had only 10% nematode control. line 68-3- <dig> also has the same inserted genes as line 66-1- <dig> and had nematode control up to 79%. the single-vector transformed lines without rol genes reduced nematode population by 64-100%, depending on line. this shows that, independent of the rolabc genes, the pv <dig> rnai construct has the ability to control nematode population in walnuts. based on the c. elegans ortholog ttr- <dig> rnai phenotype , it was predicted that pv <dig> rnai should not reduce nematode populations and there was no significant difference in nematode numbers per root between lines transformed with pv <dig>  and untransformed controls, showing that neither the transformation procedure itself nor silencing this putative gene affected nematode survival. our results suggest that c. elegans rnai phenotypes may be good predictors of p. vulnus rnai efficiency. this would simplify choosing other targets for suppression of p. vulnus.

the  <dig> bp pv <dig> rnai fragment inserted into walnut successfully interfered with nematode reproduction in some transgenic lines, leading to as much as 79% nematode control in co-transformed and 100% in some single-vector transformed roots with this fragment. similar results were obtained when four different rnai gene silencing constructs were used to transform soybean roots  <cit> . all four constructs decreased the number of mature soybean cyst nematodes at  <dig> days after infection by over 75%. in planta delivery of the rnai fragment to the nematode provides continued exposure of the nematode to the rnai fragments as the nematode feeds  <cit> . two meloidogyne incognita genes  were successfully silenced in nematodes feeding on rnai-transformed tobacco roots  <cit> . the galls that formed on the rnai-transformed roots were significantly smaller in size and number than those in untransformed control plants. silencing of the m. incognita gene encoding cathepsin l-cysteine, mi-cpl- <dig>  using an  <dig> bp fragment reduced the number of females that could produce eggs by 60% when the nematodes were soaked in an octopamine solution  <dig> days after infection  <cit> . the dsrna may be ingested by the feeding nematodes through the feeding tubes. alternatively, dsrna molecules are processed by the plant rnai machinery and sirna are ingested  <cit> . thus, it was reasonable to assume that the gene fragments we used could also be taken up by the nematode.

we observed phenotypic differences in walnut plants transformed with rolabc genes. while our constructs had no rolabc genes in the t-dna, those three genes were inserted when we used a. rhizogenes for co-transformation. shoot and root phenotypes were consistent with the expected effects of inserted rolabc genes  <cit> . rola induces wrinkled, slightly curled leaves and dense, bushy foliage in transgenic walnut plants. rolb is considered the most important rol gene for root induction. rolb increases rooting potential. in many plants, introducing rolb alone efficiently induced fast-growing, highly branched, and plagiotropic roots. the thicker, well-developed root system observed in transgenic in vitro plantlets is due to rolb, which increases tissue auxin sensitivity and alters leaf morphology  <cit> . our transformed plants also had shorter internodes in shoots and increased branching in roots due to the insertion of rolc. similar results were obtained in walnut shoots  <cit> . the root phenotypic characters reported here conflict with a previous report of few, fibrous roots in walnut plants transformed with rolabc  <cit> . our in vitro walnut plantlets had abundant healthy, long, thick roots.

we have demonstrated here that similar to other plant parasitic nematodes studied, the rln p. vulnus is amenable to dsrna-mediated rnai via feeding on transgenic plant materials containing dsrna. therefore, rlns, which are migratory endoparasites, can potentially be controlled using this technique. this result agrees with the recently published p. thornei and p. zeae results using double stranded rna-induced gene silencing via soaking  <cit>  and transcriptomes analysis of p. thornei and p. coffeae to confirm the presence of an efficient exogenous rnai pathway and mechanism  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
silencing the genes encoding iaam, ipt, and pv <dig> can greatly decrease crown gall formation and simultaneously reduce root lesion nematode infestations in walnuts. the most efficient co-transformation was achieved when bacterial mixtures were combined in similar concentrations. a transformation system using only one vector was more effective than co-transformation in achieving higher control of rlns. the c. elegans ortholog of pv <dig> is a spliceosome subunit whose rnai phenotype includes sterility or juvenile lethality in c. elegans; our results suggest pv <dig> suppression has a similar effect on p. vulnus. pv <dig>  as predicted based on knowledge of its c. elegans ortholog, did not adversely affect p. vulnus populations. these results suggest c. elegans rnai phenotypes may be good predictors for p. vulnus rnai results, which would help greatly in choosing other targets for p. vulnus suppression. viable resistance to root lesion nematodes in crop plants may be achieved in the future using rnai technology. more research is still needed to determine if the construct used in this work has interfered with juvenile development or egg production.

p. vulnus feeding experiments and crown gall testing of the transformed rr <dig> and additional transformed j <dig> embryo lines are underway. after successful characterization of those lines, they will be micropropagated as walnut shoots, rooted, and the in vitro results will be confirmed in greenhouse and field tests. studying nematode population dynamics and gene expression following digestion of dsrna will provide additional information for successful control of root lesion nematodes in walnuts.
