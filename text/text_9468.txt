BACKGROUND
plasmacytoid dcs  are highly specialized cells that produce large amounts of interferon-α  in response to a wide range of viruses and other microbial stimuli  <cit> . infant and adult human pdcs express high levels of toll-like receptors   <dig> and  <dig>  but not tlr <dig>  <cit> . human tlrs  <dig> and  <dig> are members of the endosomal tlr <dig> subfamily that sense rna moieties intracellularly and signal through the adaptor myd <dig>  <cit> . the imidazoquinolone and guanosine-like compound, resiquimod , stimulates human tlrs 7/ <dig>  <cit> .

sex differences in adult pdc ifn-α production have been previously described, with production being higher in females than males  <cit> . however, the reported effects of female sex hormones on tlr7-mediated pdc ifn-α production have been varied  <cit> . the effects of male sex hormones have not been previously determined. within the first six months of life, infants experience a “mini-puberty”. during this time period, circulating levels of sex hormones approach the levels seen during puberty  <cit> . we found that during the “mini-puberty” period female infant pdcs also have higher pdc ifn-α production than male infants in response to 1 μm r- <dig> stimulation. androgen signaling downregulated r- <dig> stimulated pdc ifn-α production. this sex effect on pdc ifn-α production may play a role in the female survival benefit seen during early infancy. however, the effect of sex on pdcs may have a cost of higher rates of systemic lupus erythematosus  and autoimmune diseases later in adult females compared to adult males  <cit> . here we describe a novel effect of male sex hormones on tlr7-mediated pdc ifn-α production.

RESULTS
as part of a prospective study of dengue virus infections during infancy in san pablo, philippines, we collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from healthy infants at approximately two months of age. we measured pdc ifn-α and tumor necrosis factor-α  production to 1 μm r- <dig> stimulation by intracellular cytokine staining  in healthy infant pbmc from  <dig> randomly selected donors . figure 1a shows the gating strategy for the flow cytometry. pdcs were  <dig>  % of live pbmc in our early infancy samples. we found that the percentage of ifn-α + pdcs , but not tnf-α + pdcs , was significantly higher in female infants compared to male infants following 1 μm r- <dig> stimulation. there were no significant differences in age or world health organization  anthropometric measures between the sexes . pbmc viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion in the cell cultures and was similar between the two sexes . higher r- <dig> and tlr7-mediated pdc ifn-α production has been previously reported in adult females compared to adult males  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a similar phenomenon has been reported during early infancy. tlr <dig> expression has not been found to be different between the sexes  <cit> . in one report, 17-β-estradiol was reported to augment tlr9-mediated pdc ifn-α production  <cit> ; but in another report, 17-β-estradiol did not affect tlr7-mediated pdc ifn-α production  <cit> . the reported effects of progesterone on tlr-mediated pdc ifn-α production have also been conflicting. meier et al. demonstrated that plasma progesterone levels significantly correlated with pdc ifn-α production in response to stimulation with an hiv-1–derived tlr7/ <dig> ligand  <cit> . by contrast, hughes et al. found that progesterone inhibited cpg-mediated and vesicular stomatitis virus-induced ifn-α production by pdcs  <cit> .

during the “mini-puberty” stage  <cit> , male infants have markedly higher circulating testosterone and dihydrotestosterone  levels compared to female infants  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that androgen signaling would decrease pdc ifn-α production in response to r- <dig> stimulation. dht is a more potent androgen than testosterone  <cit> . pretreatment of female adult pdcs with dht decreased r-848-stimulated ifn-α production, but not tnf-α production, in a dose dependent manner . a similar finding was seen for cpg-mediated tlr <dig> stimulation in the pdcs . the downregulation of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> stimulated pdc ifn-α production contrasts with the reported positive associations between androgens and serum inflammatory markers  <cit> . pdc ifn-α production is dependent on interferon regulatory factor  <dig>   <cit> . the irf <dig> promoter contains androgen responsive elements and higher levels of irf <dig> have been seen in the lungs of female norway rats compared to males  <cit> . we postulate that the lower r- <dig> stimulated pdc ifn-α production in male infants is at least partly due to androgen effects on irf <dig> levels within the first six months of life. future studies are planned to examine the effect of androgens on pdc irf <dig> levels.

female infants enjoy a survival benefit compared to male infants in the first six months of life. in particular, staphylococcus aureus infections  <cit>  and respiratory viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus   <cit>  predominate in males during early infancy. staphylococcus aureus and several airborne and respiratory rna viruses  can modulate tlr7-mediated pdc ifn-α production during their pathogenesis  <cit> . higher pdc ifn-α production in females during early infancy may contribute to their survival benefit. later in life, this sex effect may contribute to a higher incidence of sle and autoimmune diseases in females  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we found that r-848-stimulated pdc ifn-α production, but not pdc tnf-α production, was higher in girls compared to boys during early infancy. androgen signaling downregulated r-848-stimulated pdc ifn-α production, but not pdc tnf-α production, in a dose dependent fashion. we postulate that androgen effects on pdcs play a role during the “mini-puberty” of early infancy in the sex differences of r-848-stimulated pdc ifn-α production.
