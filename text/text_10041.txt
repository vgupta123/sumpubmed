BACKGROUND
in leaves, assimilated carbon is either transiently stored as starch in the chloroplasts or exported to sink tissues in the form of sucrose, synthesized in the cytosol. to maintain an optimum photosynthetic rate, this carbon partitioning needs to be highly regulated  <cit> . this regulation is strongly dependent on the circadian rhythm of the plant and carbon metabolite levels and is carried out through the export of triose phosphate intermediates produced in the chloroplast during the reductive pentose phosphate pathway or the calvin-benson cycle  <cit> . in c <dig> plants, several key enzymes are necessary for a highly coordinated carbon metabolism. these include fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase , of which three isoforms have been reported  <cit> . a cytosolic enzyme , present both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, participates in gluconeogenesis and sucrose synthesis  <cit> . a chloroplastic isoform , also found in photosynthetic eukaryotes  <cit> , is regulated by the reduction of disulphide bonds via thioredoxin  as well as by changes in the ph and mg2+ concentration that results from illumination  <cit> . recently, another plastidial cfbp isoform  was identified in our laboratory  <cit> . in contrast to cfbp <dig>  this novel isoform lacks the regulatory redox domain required for activation by trx. a fraction of the triose phosphates is used to produce ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate for calvin-benson cycle regeneration via a cfbp <dig> and the remainder can be exported to the cytosol to be converted to sucrose via cyfbp. the function of cfbp <dig> in sucrose synthesis and the control of carbohydrate distribution still has to be elucidated.

it has been reported that the reduction in cfbp <dig> activity in arabidopsis  plants leads to an increase in soluble sugar  <cit> . more recently, rojas-gonzalez and coworkers  <cit>  have characterized physiologically and metabolically the loss-of-function mutants cyfbp and cfbp <dig>  the knock-out cfbp <dig> line shows a dwarf phenotype, chlorotic leaves, a low photosynthesis rate, and a high sucrose/starch rate. on the other hand, cyfbp displays a wild-type phenotype, a decreased photosynthesis capacity, and high starch synthesis and mobilization rates  <cit> . finally, simultaneous over-expression of a triose phosphate/phosphate translocator and cyfbp in arabidopsis causes increases in soluble sugars and starch contents  <cit> . other works highlight the key role of fbpases in the control of the sucrose/starch balance  <cit> .

in arabidopsis and plants of agricultural interest, the balance between the distribution and utilization of carbohydrates  has been studied using wild-type plants  <cit>  and knock-out mutants of transcriptional or redox regulators of primary-metabolism enzymes , starchless mutants , and combining the generation of knock-out mutants and whole-genome microarray analyses . thousands of genes showed significant transcript changes in arabidopsis starchless mutants lacking the chloroplastic isoform of phosphoglucomutase  gene when compared with wild-type plants at different time-points during diurnal light/dark cycles  <cit> . nevertheless, little is known about the proteome profiling in plant carbohydrate metabolism. considering the importance that fbpases have in plant-carbohydrate homeostasis, in this study we performed a genome-wide mrna- and protein-profiling analysis comparing rosette and root organs from arabidopsis cfbp <dig> and cyfbp knock-out mutants with wild-type plants. we found that:  cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants affect the expression of a broad range of genes, representing the reprogramming of near to 10% of the arabidopsis genome;  cfbp <dig> or cyfbp gene disruption induces different expression profiles in rosettes and roots;  differentially expressed genes/proteins are related to carbon metabolism, protein metabolism, cell signalling, gene regulation, transport, and stress responses; and  the transcriptome and the proteome data were correlated.

RESULTS
differentially expressed genes in arabidopsis knock-out mutants lacking cfbp <dig> and cyfbp genes
to analyse the genome-wide effects of cfbp <dig> or cyfbp gene disruption in rosettes and roots tissues, we performed a microarray analysis comparing cfbp <dig> and cyfbp knock-out mutants with the wild-type plants using a 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray representing the genome of arabidopsis. a bootstrap analysis with significance analysis of microarrays  was used to identify differentially expressed genes. sam calculates the fold change and significance of differences in expression. the delta values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for each comparison. the false significant number  ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , while the false discovery rate  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . of the  <dig>  protein-coding gene transcripts analysed,  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed, of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  corresponded to up- and down-regulated genes, respectively . there was a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially regulated genes in both cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants, respectively, representing the reprogramming of  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total evaluated transcriptome . the cfbp <dig> mutation was associated with  <dig> and  <dig>  up-regulated genes in rosettes and roots, respectively, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed an increased expression pattern in rosettes and roots of the cyfbp background. for down-regulated expression profiles,  <dig> and  <dig> down-regulated genes were identified in rosettes and roots of the cfbp <dig> background, respectively, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in rosettes and roots of the cyfbp background . notably, the roots showed very few down-regulated genes  in comparison to the up-regulated genes  reported in both fbpase mutants. a full list of significantly altered transcripts  is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig> table  <dig> statistical summary of significance analyses of microarrays

the number of up- and down-regulated genes that are differentially expressed in rosettes and roots tissues in both cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants when compared with wild-type plants




considering the fact that cfbp <dig> and cyfbp are both key genes in the carbohydrate metabolism, one can postulate that a high proportion of the differentially expressed genes identified in our microarray experiments should be sharing between cfbp <dig> and cyfbp. to determine whether cfbp <dig> or cyfbp gene disruption induces similar gene-expression-profile changes, we compared the differentially expressed genes between mutants and plant organs . as shown in the venn diagram, most of the genes are specifically regulated in rosettes and roots of the respective genetic backgrounds. of the  <dig>  fbp-regulated genes,  <dig> and  <dig>  genes are regulated only in rosettes and roots of cfbp <dig>  respectively, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> others are exclusively regulated in rosettes and roots of cyfbp, respectively and might be considered as genes which are responding differentially in rosettes and roots in both cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants. however, those genes which are specifically regulated in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp belong to the same functional categories, as discussed below, the most abundant groups corresponded to  genes with no assigned biological process;  protein synthesis, turnover, and destination; and  rna regulation, processing, and binding. it means that although differentially expressed genes are specific to each mutant, the same functional biological processes are affected.fig.  <dig> differential gene expression in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants. venn diagram showing the overlap of genes differentially expressed in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants. most of regulated genes are mutant and tissue specific




cluster analysis of microarray data
a k-means clustering analysis was performed to gain an overview of the performance of each differentially expressed gene, compared with the others in the rosettes and roots of both the cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants. six clusters were defined .fig.  <dig> clusters of transcripts based on patterns of differential expression. a representative fragment of clustering analysis showing the behaviour of each gene relative to the others in rosettes and roots of cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants . the figure shows up-regulated genes in rosettes of cfbp <dig> and cyfbp, down-regulated genes in cfbp <dig> roots; and up- or down-regulated genes in cyfbp roots. differentially expressed transcripts were clustered, using the k-means method. six clusters were created , with clusters a and d comprising up-regulated genes in rosettes and roots of cyfbp, respectively; and clusters f and c comprising down-regulated genes. clusters e and b comprising up- and down-regulated genes in cfbp <dig> rosettes. clusters c and a comprising up- and down-regulated genes in cfbp <dig> roots, respectively. the x-axis represents  cfbp <dig> rosettes  cfbp <dig> roots  cyfbp rosettes, and  cyfbp roots. the y-axis represents the expression level




cluster a includes  <dig> transcripts with cyfbp rosette up-regulated expression and down-regulated gene expression in cfbp <dig> roots . of these transcripts,  <dig> % encode hypothetical or unknown proteins. the cluster includes known genes which are involved in the calvin cycle, glycolysis, or starch metabolism, such as the coding for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , cfbp <dig> gene , beta-amylase  <dig> and  <dig> , and adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit  <dig> . one striking finding was that transcripts encoding proteins required for sugar transport  were enriched only in clusters a, b and c, which are constituted mainly by up-regulating genes in cyfbp rosettes and cfbp <dig> roots. cluster b contained  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> % of which encoded hypothetical or unknown proteins . these transcripts had mainly down-regulated expression in cfbp <dig> rosettes. cluster-b transcripts include genes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and starch metabolism such as pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructose-1-kinase , pyruvate kinase , and beta-amylase  <dig> . cluster c contains  <dig>  transcripts, most of them with up-regulated expression in cfbp <dig> roots . these transcripts exhibited peak expression in cfbp <dig> roots with down-regulated expression in cyfbp roots. approximately  <dig> % of the cluster-c transcripts encode hypothetical or unknown proteins. transcripts that encode proteins which are essential in the calvin cycle are present in this cluster. for example, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase b  and the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain . cluster d includes  <dig> transcripts with high expression in cyfbp roots. of these transcripts,  <dig> % encode hypothetical or unknown proteins. it is worth mentioning that a large number of up-regulated genes encoding for enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis fell into this cluster . these include phosphoglycerate kinase , phosphoglucomutase , glucose-6-phosphate isomerase , pfk <dig> and pfk2-phosphofructokinase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ,  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate mutase  <dig> , and pyruvate kinase .

clustering analysis also revealed groups of co-ordinately expressed genes in rosettes of cfbp <dig> and cyfbp. genes that were up-regulated in cfbp <dig> rosettes and down-regulated in cyfbp were represented by clusters e and f, respectively . the percentage of the transcripts encoding hypothetical proteins or unknown proteins was  <dig> % in cluster e and  <dig> % in cluster f. curiously, there were no genes associated with sucrose or starch metabolism in cluster f.

biological processes affected by fbpase genes disruption
next, we investigated which metabolic and cellular processes were affected by cfbp <dig> or cyfbp inactivation. for this, the final list of regulated genes with their differential expression values was imported into mapman  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  together with the mapping file containing tair arabidopsis whole genome annotation. since the correspondence between go terms and mapman bins is not trivial, we have finally discarded these approaches. but we performed the statistical analysis of functional categories  with the over-representation analysis of pageman . this is a classical statistical test for classes: given the number of objects chosen, the total number of objects, and the class size, the test provides a statistical evidence  to discern which object  from a class  is not classified by chance. therefore, the numbers of genes included in bins are those that the ora analyses considered over-represented in the differentially expressed sets. thus, differentially expressed genes were assigned to  <dig> functional category bins . most differentially expressed genes  in both cfbp <dig> and cyfbp fell into three classes:  genes with no assigned biological process;  protein synthesis, turnover, and destination; and  rna regulation, processing, and binding. miscellaneous enzymes were well represented . cell signalling, cell organization, and carbon metabolism and transport, together with biotic and abiotic stress, represented more than 20% of the differentially regulated genes .fig.  <dig> mapman bin membership for differentially expressed genes in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp. differentially expressed genes with their differential expression values were imported into mapman software version  <dig> . <dig>  seventeen functional category bins were created. the bin numbers and their corresponding bin name are graphed on the y-axis. percentage of probe sets in each bin is graphed on the x-axis




photosynthesis, photorespiration, and carbon metabolism related genes
the differentially expressed genes involved in photosynthesis, photorespiration, and the calvin cycle identified in this study were up- and down-regulated in rosettes and roots of cfbp <dig>  respectively . in leaf the genes adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase small subunit  <dig>  and sucrose synthase  are up- regulated and the genes chlorophyll a-b binding protein , photosystem ii reaction centre psbp protein , and photosystem i subunit iv protein  are down-regulated . root up-regulated genes encoding for fructose-bisphosphate aldolase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase b  and  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate mutase  . curiously, though in a non-photosynthetic organ, root up- and down-regulated loci included genes encoding for photosystem i reaction centre subunit psak protein , phytochromobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase  and photosystem ii reaction centre w protein . in the case of cyfbp, most of the differentially expressed genes were up-regulated in rosette leaves, as the coding for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , photosystem i reaction centre subunit iii protein  and phytochromobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase , and up- or down-regulated in roots such as ferredoxin-nadp+ reductase , rubisco activase  and phosphoglycerate kinase  <dig> , and the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain , respectively. notably, cyfbp  was found to be up-regulated in cfbp <dig> rosettes . this result was previously reported by rojas-gonzalez and co-workers  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of regulated genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. a model of starch and sucrose metabolism is represented. the model shows genes  revealing an altered expression profile in cfbp <dig> rosettes and roots; and cyfbp rosettes and roots. rosette regulated genes  are numbered as follows: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , cfbp <dig> , adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit  <dig> , beta-amylase  <dig> , alpha-isoamylase  <dig> , four sugar transporter family proteins b amylase  <dig> and  <dig> , pyruvate kinase , pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase , pfkb-like carbohydrate kinase , trehalose-phosphatase synthase  <dig> , trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase . root regulated genes  are: ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain , rubisco activase , rubisco small subunit , phosphoglycerate kinase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase b , fructose-bisphosphate aldolase , cfbp <dig> , carbohydrate transmembrane transporter , pyruvate kinase ,  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate mutase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , xilulose kinase  <dig> , cyfbp , phosphofructokinases pfk <dig>  and pfk <dig> ; glucose-6-phosphate isomerase , inositol-3-phosphate synthase , inositol-3-phosphate synthase .  indicates up-regulated, and  indicates down-regulated. pink circles indicate genes which are supposed to be located in plastid or plasma membranes, according to cell efp browser prediction for subcellular localization .  predicted as plasma membrane and/or golgi apparatus transporters;  three putative localizations: plasma membrane, golgi apparatus, and plastid




it is also worth noting that a large number of key genes encoding for enzymes associated with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis showed altered expression profiles in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp genetic backgrounds . it appears that transcript accumulation for an enzyme catalysing the opposite reaction of fbpase, pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase , was down-regulated in cfbp <dig> rosette leaves together with pyruvate kinase . nevertheless, specific root transcriptional re-adjustment included the up- and down-regulation of  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate mutase  and phosphoglucomutase , respectively. the cyfbp root tissue showed a rise in transcript levels of genes encoding for phosphoglucomutase , glucose-6-phosphate isomerase , pfk <dig> and pfk2-phosphofructokinase , the cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ,  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate mutase  <dig> , and pyruvate kinase , while an increase of chloroplastic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was detected in cyfbp rosettes . surprisingly, whatever the inactivated fbpase isoform, the above-mentioned genes all encoded for enzymes participating in cytosolic biochemical pathways.

some genes involved in sucrose biosynthesis, such as sucrose synthase , and cyfbp , were up-regulated in rosettes of cfbp <dig> mutant, whereas starch-degradation related genes, e.g. beta-amylase  <dig> , were down-regulated in rosettes and up-regulated in roots. in contrast, genes encoding for enzymes involved in starch metabolism were up-regulated both in rosettes as well as in roots of cyfbp. mutant studies show that the gene alpha-isoamylase  <dig>  is strongly involved in starch breakdown whilst adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit  <dig>  is related to starch synthesis  <cit>  . several of the proteins encoded by the root differentially-expressed genes were found among the  <dig> proteins identified by balmer et al.  <cit>  in the amyloplast of wheat endosperm. most of them are involved in carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, cell division, stress, signaling and transport.

redox regulation and stress responses
more than  <dig> genes involved in the redox status were regulated in the two fbpase-lacking mutants. most of these encode for glutaredoxins, thioredoxins or proteins associated with ascorbate and glutathione metabolism. in general, glutaredoxin-related genes  were negatively affected in rosettes or roots of cfbp <dig>  whilst thioredoxins  and ascorbate-glutathione-related genes were up-regulated . most of the redox-associated genes were up-regulated in cyfbp rosettes and roots . these genes include thioredoxin reductase b , thioredoxin aty <dig>  cytochrome reductase , thioredoxin-like 1- <dig> , and catalase  <dig> . furthermore,  <dig> genes associated with biotic and abiotic stress have also been identified in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp backgrounds. the proportions of up- or down-regulated genes were relatively similar in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp rosettes and in cfbp <dig> roots, while cyfbp roots had only two down-regulated  and  <dig> up-regulated genes .

classification based on mapman, and gene ontology and corroborated with pageman has shown that cfbp <dig> or cyfbp inactivation affected the whole-genome expression levels in a wide range of molecular functions and biochemical pathways. however, it was helpful to find that the functional category biotic and abiotic stress was well represented . of the loci responding to stress responses,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as regulated in rosettes and roots of the cfbp <dig> background, respectively, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> genes were regulated in rosettes and roots of the cyfbp background . to understand the significance of this result more clearly, we performed a gene-clustering analysis comparing all differentially expressed genes found in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp with five stress-related experiments that used the arabidopsis oligonucleotide microarrays. these data sets are available in geo data repository and correspond to transcriptional analyses of arabidopsis subjected to abiotic stress by arsenate  <cit> , cu2+ , drought, and combined drought and heat stress  <cit> , and subjected to biotic stress by tobacco etch potyvirus  infection  <cit> . comparisons of these data sets reveal that cfbp1- and cyfbp-regulated genes are also differentially expressed in response to biotic and abiotic stress . we also conducted k-means clustering analysis to group the regulated genes from all experiments according to the similarity of their expression patterns, using mev software with the default options. four and six clusters were defined after comparison of rosette and root fbp-regulated genes with the other data sets, respectively .

rna regulation, processing and binding
in rosettes and roots, cfbp <dig> and cyfbp gene disruptions induce a highly dynamic transcriptional regulation. one hundred transcription factors were found as differentially expressed in cfbp <dig> rosettes,  <dig> in cfbp <dig> roots,  <dig> in cyfbp rosettes and  <dig> in cyfbp roots . this means that  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the differentially expressed genes found in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp, respectively, coded for transcription factors. these transcription factors belong mainly to ap2/erebp, bzip, bhlh, myb, gata, wrky, c2c <dig> dof, and c2h <dig> zinc finger family proteins and probably could regulate upstream components of the transcriptional response to cfbp <dig> or cyfbp gene inactivation.

cell signalling
over  <dig> receptor kinases, soluble protein kinases, ser/thr protein phosphatases, map kinase pathway components, calcium binding, and g-proteins showed alteration of their respective transcript levels in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp backgrounds. among these,  <dig> genes were affected in cfbp <dig> rosettes,  <dig> in cfbp <dig> roots,  <dig> in cyfbp rosettes, and  <dig> in cyfbp roots . these proteins are known to play pivotal roles in regulating and coordinating aspects of metabolism, cell growth, cell differentiation, and cell division  <cit> . the implication of ser/thr protein phosphatases in the control of the redox reactions of photosynthesis has recently been documented  <cit> . in cfbp <dig> rosettes, the proportion of up- or down-regulated genes was similar; nevertheless, most of the cell-signalling-related genes are up-regulated in cfbp <dig> roots and cyfbp rosettes.

over  <dig> genes assigned to hormone metabolism and signalling showed modified expression profiles in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp . most were auxin- or gibberellins-regulated genes, followed by abscisic acid or ethylene-response genes. only  <dig> genes were down-regulated,  <dig> of them in cfbp <dig> rosettes, whilst the rest were up-regulated.

protein synthesis, turnover, and destination
protein synthesis, degradation, and modification group is the second-best-represented category after the one assigned to genes with unknown biological functions. in this category, most of the regulated genes are involved in protein degradation, particularly those involved in the ubiquitin pathway, followed by genes associated with protein synthesis and post-translational modification. sixty-three genes belonging to the ubiquitin pathway were differentially expressed in cfbp <dig> rosettes,  <dig> in cfbp <dig> roots,  <dig> in cyfbp rosettes, and  <dig> in cyfbp roots . our results indicate that protein-degradation machinery plays an important role in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants; it can be part of the normal protein-turnover process but can also play a role in an ubiquitin complex involved in signalling via protein degradation.

transport
the transcript levels of several genes involved in amino acid, peptide, calcium, phosphate, membrane, and particularly sugar transport were altered in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp backgrounds . a gene encoding for udp-galactose transporter  <dig>  was down-regulated in cfbp <dig> rosettes, while sugar transporter  <dig> , gdp-mannose transmembrane transporter  <dig> , and a putative monosaccharide transporter  were up-regulated in cfbp <dig> roots . sugar transporter  <dig>  and three sugar transporter family proteins  were up-regulated in cyfbp rosettes, and only a mannitol transporter  was down-regulated. finally, a carbohydrate transmembrane transporter  and two udp-galactose transporters  were up-regulated in cyfbp roots, whereas two monosaccharide transporters were down-regulated in this organ  .

validation of differentially expressed genes, using qrt-pcr
to validate the cfbp <dig> and cyfbp microarray results, we performed quantitative real-time pcr  on a set of  <dig> genes, representing different functional categories, which were up- or down-regulated in rosette and root . the genes selected for qrt-pcr belonged to the most representatives functional categories, such as protein synthesis, degradation, and post-translational modification , rna regulation, processing and binding , glycolysis and gluconeogenesis , photosynthesis and calvin-cycle-related genes , transport , development , redox regulation , miscellaneous enzymes , and unassigned biological process . the qrt-pcr results supported microarray data, and also showed that the gene-expression pattern was identical for all genes tested. as shown in table  <dig>  the expression values were higher when qrt-pcr was used in relation to the data provided by the microarray, indicating that real time pcr is a more sensitive method.table  <dig> validation by qrt-pcr of differentially expressed genes

differentially regulated proteins from rosettes and roots of cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants
microarrays provide an almost totally comprehensive assessment of the transcriptome that is not necessarily reflected at the protein or functional levels, and therefore we then pursued a proteomic approach to study protein profiles in fbp mutants. the analysis of the 2-de pattern revealed a total of  <dig> different protein-spot intensities out of about  <dig> that were resolved in each image . from these spots,  <dig> and  <dig> corresponded to proteins regulated in rosettes and roots of cfbp <dig>  respectively, whereas the  <dig> and  <dig> others were regulated in rosettes and roots of cyfbp mutant, respectively . figure  <dig> shows representative experiments  for the determination of up- and down-regulated proteins in rosettes and roots from fbp mutants through the analysis of the protein spots picked and identified by ms . these spots correspond to proteins with putative functions in general metabolism, photosynthesis, protein synthesis, protein destination, signalling, rna regulation, hormone metabolism, redox regulation, cell organization, development, biotic and abiotic stress, and miscellaneous enzymes and proteins with unknown functions .fig.  <dig> 2-de images from rosette and root tissues of cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants. 2-de gels of total proteins from rosette and root tissues of cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants. the indicated portions of the gel, a through c, are reproduced in enlarged windows, a through c, of 2-de gels for each mutant and tissue.  2-de gel of total proteins from rosette tissue of cfbp <dig> mutant and enlarged panels, cfbp <dig>  and wt plants .  portions of selected regions of 2-de gels showing rosette tissue of cyfbp mutant against wt plants.  2-de gel of total proteins from root tissue of cyfbp mutant and enlarged panels, cyfbp  and wt plant .  selected regions of 2-de gels showing root tissue of cfbp <dig> mutant against wt plants. protein spots indicated  were identified by maldi-tof/tof analysis . the figure shows representative experiments carried out three times




as we expected, our proteomic analyses demonstrated that the lack of cfbp <dig> and cyfbp also triggers changes at the protein level. in the case of the cfbp <dig> mutant, among the up- or down-regulated protein found in rosettes and roots, several are involved in photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase c <dig>  and rubisco activase  were up-regulated in rosettes, whereas the granule-bound starch synthase  was down-regulated in roots. furthermore, a number of up- or down regulated proteins  are also involved in biotic and abiotic stress, such as: glutathione s-transferase , a well-known marker of stress involved in reactive oxygen species  detoxifying processes  <cit> ; atndx <dig> , a member of the nudix hydrolase family of proteins that helps protect against oxidative dna and rna damage in plant cells  <cit> ; the tudor-sn protein  <dig> , which is essential for stress tolerance and stabilizes the levels of stress-responsive mrnas; monodehydroascorbate reductase , which is associated with salt tolerance through scavenging of ros  <cit> ; the hypersensitive-induced response protein  <dig> ; cold-shock protein  <dig> ; the athva22h protein , which is induced under stress by drought, chilling, and high salinity  <cit> ; and zeaxanthin epoxidase , which is involved in chlorophyll protection against oxidative damage  <cit> . in relation to the protein spots in cyfbp background identified, some are also associated with photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism: soluble starch synthase , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , gdp-l-fucose synthase  were down-regulated in cyfbp rosettes. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase b , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , alanine aminotransferase , 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase , and beta-glucosidase  were up-regulated in cyfbp roots, whereas fructokinase  and ketose-bisphosphate aldolase  were down-regulated. some 35% of the protein spots identified were predicted to be plastid-localized, indicating that cfbp <dig> or cyfbp gene disruption affects mainly proteins associated with plastids. it is worth noting that the functional category “redox regulation” was better represented in proteomic data  when compared with microarray data sets . it has been reported that the correlation between mrna and protein abundance varies by gene functional group  <cit> , implying that the translation-level regulation of redox-related proteins might be critical in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants. by contrast, the proteins related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway appeared well represented in both microarray and proteomic data sets, suggesting that the regulation of protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system might be important both at the transcriptome and proteome levels.

congruence of cfbp <dig> and cyfbp array data with proteome analysis
we compared the cfbp1- and cyfbp-regulated proteins identified by 2-de in rosettes and roots with the differentially regulated transcripts detected by microarray analysis. protein spots corresponding to  <dig> of the  <dig> identified differentially expressed spots had differential rna accumulation . from these protein spots, seven were regulated in cfbp <dig> rosettes,  <dig> in cfbp <dig> roots,  <dig> in cyfbp rosettes, and  <dig> in cyfbp roots. differentially expressed genes and protein levels changes identified simultaneously by using transcriptome analysis and proteomics technology fell into important functional categories, including cell redox homeostasis , protein process , metabolic process  cell signalling , and rna regulation .

carbohydrate metabolism and its regulation are complex phenomena that may be driven by the coordinate expression of numerous genes. transcription profiling and proteomics data are not available for cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants and, therefore, this study provides a compilation of in-depth transcriptome and proteome effects of cfbp <dig> or cyfbp gene disruption, and can help elucidate the importance of the different steps regulated by these enzymes in controlling carbohydrate metabolism and, indirectly, other processes in arabidopsis. our results show that about 10% of the total evaluated transcriptome was affected by cfbp <dig> or cyfbp gene disruption. it has been previously reported that a perturbation in the carbohydrate balance can affect a high number of genes involved in general metabolic reactions, signalling, gene regulation, and protein metabolism. osuna et al.  <cit>  reported changes in transcript levels for > <dig>  genes after 3 h of 15 mm sucrose addition to arabidopsis plants. a comprehensive analysis revealed radical changes at the metabolic, proteomic, and overall transcriptional levels during a circadian cycle and extended night in wild-type arabidopsis plants and starchless pgm mutant  <cit> . bläsing et al.  <cit>  showed that more than 17% of the genes presented more than a two-fold larger diurnal change in the starchless pgm mutant when compared with col- <dig>  the large percentage of affected genes found in our analysis, together with major phenotypic and physiological changes  <cit> , reflects the severe impact of omitting both cfbp <dig> as cyfbp activities from the metabolic scene and the physiological adaptations derived from the lack of both enzymes. similarly, usadel et al.  <cit> , on conducting an overall transcriptome analysis during a circadian cycle in wild-type and starchless pgm mutant plants, observed a decrease in transcripts for genes involved in biosynthesis and cellular growth but an increase for genes involved in the remobilization of alternative carbon sources. pageman statistical analyses of our study have shown differentially expressed functional categories. the classification by functional categories shows that expression changes of genes related to protein metabolism and modification, rna regulation, signalling, photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, biotic and abiotic stress, and redox regulation were more susceptible to cfbp <dig> or cyfbp gene inactivation than were other genes.

comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed that in addition to the metabolism-related genes, other mechanisms might contribute to explain the phenotypic differences and developmental alterations in cfbp <dig> compared to cyfbp  <cit> . the cfbp <dig> mutant presents a smaller rosette size, low chlorophyll content and co2-assimilation rate in relation to wild-type plants that trigger in a lesser rosette development, a lower content of soluble sugars, less starch accumulation, and a greater superoxide dismutase  activity  <cit> . the mutant also had some developmental alterations, including stomatal opening defects and increased numbers of root vascular layers. for example, a significant number of the cfbp <dig> differently regulated genes encoded proteins that were related to cell wall biosynthesis/modification, development and redox regulation . it is important to note that the lack of cfbp <dig> and cyfbp is leading to an important impact on genes related to protein metabolism, rna regulation; and biotic and abiotic stress as showed in fig.  <dig>  this result is in line with the phenotype observed for cfbp <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, cfbp <dig> and cyfbp are key players in sugar metabolism in rosettes and roots from arabidopsis. previous studies have reported that reduced cfbp <dig> activity results in a lower total-sugar content but showed a higher sucrose:starch ratio in relation to control plants  <cit> . if the step catalysed by cfbp <dig> is disrupted, there is a deficit of starch synthesis that the plant would counterbalance by inducing genes related to starch synthesis or reducing those of the starch degradation. in agreement with this hypothesis, a number of genes differentially expressed in this mutant  are associated with starch metabolism, glycolysis, and the calvin-benson cycle. these data suggest that cfbp <dig> inactivation could trigger changes of down-stream pathways related to starch synthesis such as the induction of aps <dig> , trehalose-phosphatase synthase  <dig> , and pfkb-type carbohydrate kinase . however, in the cfbp <dig> mutant, the triose phosphate supply is blocked, leading to low starch content in the chloroplast and to an increased sucrose/starch ratio  <cit> . notably, cyfbp gene is induced in cfbp <dig> mutant  <cit>  as well as sucrose synthase . starch biosynthesis and degradation pathways are positively regulated both in rosettes and in roots from cyfbp. we reported that cyfbp arabidopsis mutant over-accumulates starch, without a reduction of soluble sugars in the cytosol due to cyfbp inactivation  <cit>  and the transcriptomic analysis reveals that apl <dig> gene , involved in starch synthesis is up-regulated in cyfbp background. the lack of cyfbp is leading to carbohydrate reallocation, this situation is including the cfbp <dig> induction  <cit> . curiously, important glycolysis enzymes as phosphofructokinases pfk <dig>  and pfk <dig> , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphoglycerate kinase , and pyruvate kinase  were up-regulated in cyfbp roots. based on all these results, we presume that the cyfbp disruption that provokes an over-accumulation of starch induces the expression of starch degradation and glycolysis-related genes. arabidopsis mutants lacking the pfk <dig> gene, accumulates less starch and more soluble sugars than wild-type plants  <cit> , demonstrating the opposite biological function of pfk <dig> and cyfbp during the regulation of sucrose synthesis, when pfk <dig> activity is stimulated cyfbp activity is inhibited. recent studies have also demonstrated that a sucrose phosphate synthase double knockout arabidopsis mutant  has mechanisms to alleviate the blockage of the starch-to-s6p conversion process such as starch turnover acceleration, and channeling of starch breakdown products towards the glycolytic, oxidative pentose phosphate, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways  <cit> .

the different expression of genes in rosette and roots, evidence a coordinated cross-talk between both organs in order to maintain a suitable plant development. in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants, 85% and 88% of genes are induced in roots respectively, whilst 44% and 68% are induced in rosettes. as in leaves, root transcriptome responds to the deficiencies provoked by the lack of the heterotrophic cyfbp or the photosynthetic cfbp <dig>  the analysis of functional-gene categories revealed that cfbp <dig> or cyfbp inactivation also induced expression changes of genes involved in rna regulation, protein metabolism and modification, and biotic as well as abiotic stress responses. the k-means clustering analysis indicates that cfbp <dig> and cyfbp-regulated genes are also induced in arabidopsis plants subjected to biotic and abiotic stress . ma and bohner  <cit> , defined a common stress transcriptome that apparently represents universal cell-level stress responses by analyzing the stress-dependent expression profile in arabidopsis. the plant responds to different types of stimuli by reprogramming the expression of similar metabolic pathways. the physiological and metabolic changes caused by cfbp <dig> or cyfbp gene disruption probably lead the plants to a condition of permanent stress; this is corroborated by the number of antioxidant proteins identified in the proteomic analysis and the determination of the enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism  <cit> . the situation of stress is clearly visible in cfbp <dig>  given that the growth of this mutant appeared to be severely inhibited, as shown by rojas et al.  <cit> , whereas cyfbp plants displayed a wild-type phenotype.

in this study, we found that  <dig> genes related to proteasome were regulated. proteolysis influences many metabolic activities such as biogenesis and maintenance of chloroplasts in plants  <cit> . it is well known that over  <dig>  genes contribute to protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system   <cit> . this process is responsible for removing or modifying most abnormal peptides and short-lived cell regulators. therefore, the ups affects many processes, including the cell cycle, signal transduction, transcription, and stress responses in plants  <cit> .

the arabidopsis genome encodes for more than  <dig>  transcription factors  <cit> . in both mutants, we found a large number of transcription factors to be regulated, most of these belonging to the ap2/erebp, bzip, bhlh, myb, gata, wrky, c2c <dig> dof, and c2h <dig> zinc finger transcription-factor families. members of the bzip, bhlh, myb, and dof families have been reported to be major transcriptional regulators in light signalling  <cit> , and involved in sugar signalling and carbon partitioning . the ap2/erebp family has been well-characterized  <cit>  and diverse members of this family have functions in redox-regulation in the photosynthesis context, but also in the functional linkage between hormone-dependent signalling and sugar sensing  <cit> .

gene expression is a complex process, mrna and protein abundance are affected by many cellular and physical processes, including transcription, post-transcriptional regulation, rna degradation and splicing, translation, post-translational modification, and degradation of proteins. changes in mrna levels do not always lead to similar alterations in protein levels or enzyme activities. comparative studies of mrna and protein abundance performed so far indicate that the correlation across large data sets is typically modest  <cit> . in our study, from a total number of  <dig> spots identified with differences at the protein level,  <dig>  were found to be regulated simultaneously by microarray analysis. these proteins, such as rubisco activase , glutaredoxin-c <dig> , 26s proteasome subunit  <dig> , atp-dependent clp protease  involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, and a vegetative storage protein , are associated with important functional categories . the congruence between our transcriptome and proteome analysis is of about ~20%. the apparently low correlation between proteome and microarray data is consistent with the general observation that mrna levels do not always correlate with protein levels because of post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulations and protein turnover  <cit> . in this sense, although cfbp <dig> is induced in the cyfbp mutant, no differences at the protein level were observed  <cit> , suggesting that translational regulation could be taking place. studies comparing the overlap in differential expression patterns from both transcript and protein profiling in arabidopsis have reported congruence lower to 5%  <cit> , but also a congruence of  <dig> %  <cit> . these results highlight the importance of integrating mrna and protein data in order to gain more accurate knowledge of the complex regulation mechanisms triggered by plant cells in response to a loss of key genetic information. additionally, low abundant proteins  could escape from a general proteomic analysis if specific enrichment techniques are not used. moreover, we have to take into account existing differences in the sensitivity between both techniques. in this sense, although cyfbp is induced at both transcript and protein levels in cfbp <dig>  <cit>  no protein induction has been found in the present work.

CONCLUSIONS
this large-scale characterization of transcriptome and proteome profiles provides copious data relevant to a comprehensive general understanding of the molecular basis and regulatory mechanisms underlying carbon metabolism changes in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp mutants. our experimental data are sufficient to demonstrate that cfbp <dig> and cyfbp are key genes that contribute to modulating the starch-sucrose content balance in the plant cell; and that cfbp <dig> or cyfbp mutation affects other important pathways, especially the significant regulation of genes related to carbon metabolism, protein metabolism, rna regulation, signalling, and stress responses. additionally, we provide for the first time the proteomic characterization of these metabolic changes in cfbp <dig> and cyfbp that occur in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues and we attempt to design a comprehensive scenario of the effects on carbohydrate-dependent pathways. further studies that characterize the specific modifications of these proteins will provide a unique insight into the metabolic pathways controlling the synthesis of both sucrose and starch, which are key compounds for agricultural products.
