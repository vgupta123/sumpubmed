BACKGROUND
mycobacterium is considered a diverse genus with highly pathogenic members like m. tuberculosis or m. leprae as well as less pathogenic, opportunistic and saprophytic species belonging to the so-called rapidly growing mycobacteria . the species of rgm able to cause human disease basically belong to the m. fortuitum group, the m. chelonae/abscessus group and the m. smegmatis group. members of these groups are commonly seen in aquatic environments like municipal tap water, and health care-associated outbreaks are often associated with contact to tap water or water sources such as ice.

the m. fortuitum group includes three taxa: m. fortuitum, m. peregrinum and a third biovariant complex. the m. fortuitum group is involved in 60% of localised cutaneous infections in immunocompetent persons caused by rgm but is a rare cause of pulmonary disease. most or all of the cases of community-acquired or health care-associated diseases caused by the m. fortuitum group are due to m. fortuitum. this species basically causes skin lesions, wound infections, postinjection abscesses, postsurgical wound infections or pulmonary disease in previously healthy hosts  <cit> . little is known about the virulence mechanisms and persistence of this human pathogen. however, cirillo et al.  <cit>  and da silva et al.  <cit>  reported that m. fortuitum was capable to replicate in amoebae and murine monocytic cells, respectively.

in a previous study, we showed that the intracellular survival of m. smegmatis depended on the amount of porins in the mycobacterial outer membrane . the mutant strain ml <dig> of m. smegmatis, which lacks the porins mspa and mspc  <cit> , exhibited significantly enhanced intracellular survival compared to the parental strain smr <dig>  <cit> . mspa belongs to a novel class of mycobacterial om proteins present in many rgm but apparently absent in slowly growing mycobacteria  <cit> . the main porin of m. smegmatis, mspa, is an extremely stable octameric protein composed of  <dig> kda monomers  <cit>  and provides the uptake of hydrophilic nutrients across the extraordinarily restricting mycobacterial om  <cit> . by means of dna hybridisations using a probe derived from the mspa sequence, niederweis and colleagues  <cit>  indicated that the genome of m. fortuitum contained orthologous porin genes.

since the saprophytic bacterium m. smegmatis causes disease only in rare cases  <cit>  and shows a very limited intracellular persistence  <cit> , it is important to investigate the role of porins on virulence in pathogenic members of rgm, which are able to multiply intracellularly. m. fortuitum was suggested to be a suitable model mycobacterium  <cit> . like m. tuberculosis, it resides intracellularly in vacuoles restricting interferon-γ-induced nitric oxide production and limits the maturation of phagosomes  <cit> . therefore, m. fortuitum was chosen to detect and characterise porins and to analyse their impact first on extracellular growth and in a later stage on intracellular growth. for this purpose, we used two different m. fortuitum strains  that originally were isolated from human patients. comparative analysis was performed using also the type strain m. fortuitum dsm  <dig> 

RESULTS
in order to verify the taxonomic classification and to define the phylogenetic relationship between the strains analysed, complete sequences of the 16s rrna genes were determined using the primers, which were described by adekambi and drancourt  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna sequences confirmed the taxonomic classification of the m. fortuitum strains employed .

comparison of growth rates of the employed strains was performed in broth by measuring the atp content of the cultures. compared to other methods for growth measurements such as od-measurement, cfu-counting or quantification of dna, the quantification of the atp-content has the advantage of not being biased by clumping of cultures or by inability of viable bacteria to grow on agar if plated from a broth culture or by occurrence of dead bacteria. we therefore chose this method for the comparison of the growth rates of the three strains. however, the atp content of bacteria may vary depending on their physiological state and it therefore has to be considered as a surrogate growth marker. as shown in figure  <dig> , strain 10851/ <dig> only grew very poorly, while strains 10860/ <dig> and dsm  <dig> multiplied strongly from day ten until day  <dig> or until day  <dig>  respectively.

porm genes of m. fortuitum are orthologs of mspa
to detect porin genes orthologous to mspa in m. fortuitum, preliminary hybridisation experiments were performed with a probe derived from the main porin gene of m. smegmatis mspa  using the primers hpor and npor  covering nucleotide  <dig> to  <dig>  the probe hybridised to the genomic dna from m. fortuitum strains . thus, orthologs seem to exist in all strains analysed.

to clone porin genes from m. fortuitum, genomic dna of m. fortuitum 10860/ <dig> was digested with sacii, and a  <dig> bp fragment, which hybridised to the probe, was cloned in piv <dig> and transformed into e. coli. two clones  containing porin sequences were isolated. both plasmids were found to contain the same genomic region of  <dig> bp, harbouring one porin gene. the inserts were sequenced by primer walking. both strands of the porin genes and  <dig> bp of surrounding regions were sequenced at least twice. as shown in figure 2a, the insert of the plasmids contained several open reading frames , one of which was an ortholog of mspa. it contained  <dig> bp, encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids with an n-terminal signal sequence of  <dig> amino acids, which was predicted using the signalp  <dig>  server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/signalp/ <cit> . the in silico analysis of the mature porm <dig>  showed a calculated molecular weight of the monomer of  <dig> da and an isoelectric point  of  <dig> .

a hypothetical - <dig> region of a promoter and a ribosome binding site  were identified upstream of the coding sequence. downstream of the orf a hairpin sequence was detected, which might function as a terminator . it has to be noted that the sequence similarity between m. fortuitum and m. smegmatis was only restricted to the coding sequence. according to the designation of other mycobacterial porin genes and to the instructions of embl nucleotide sequence database, the gene was named porm <dig> .

besides the porin gene, two other complete orfs and part of another orf were detected. orf <dig> was interrupted by one of the sacii sites and showed a high similarity to a molybdopterin biosynthesis protein of m. tuberculosis cdc  <dig> . orf <dig> turned out to be a mechanosensitive channel orthologous to the gene mscl from m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis str.  <dig> . orf <dig> was similar to the hypothetical protein rv0990c from m. tuberculosis h37rv . the entire cloned genomic region was blasted against the m. tuberculosis genome from the sanger institute database http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/m_tuberculosis to examine if the whole region is conserved between m. fortuitum and m. tuberculosis. however, only orf <dig> and orf <dig> possessed nucleotide identities higher than 60% showing that the region is not conserved among these mycobacteria.

a new probe derived from the porm <dig> sequence was used to detect porin genes in different m. fortuitum strains. the probe hybridised to two fragments of the sacii-digested genomic dna of different m. fortuitum strains. however, the fragment size differed among different strains . hence, the m. fortuitum genomes contain at least two porin genes.

next, the presence of porm <dig> in other m. fortuitum strains was analysed. for this purpose, the porm1-specific primers komf-3f and komf-4b  were chosen to amplify a fragment of approximately  <dig> bp, comprising the porm <dig> gene and its flanking regions. pcrs using a polymerase-mix with proofreading activity generated a fragment of the expected size in all strains. several pcrs were performed and both strands of the different fragments were sequenced. porm <dig> was detected in all three m. fortuitum strains, and the nucleotide sequences were submitted to the embl nucleotide sequence database . the nucleic acid subsequences such as the - <dig> signal of a promoter, the rbs, the signal peptide of  <dig> bp and the hairpin structure were also present and were conserved among all strains tested . as already indicated in table  <dig>  the nucleotide sequences of the gene porm <dig> differed among different strains of m. fortuitum.

the amino acid sequences of porm <dig> among the m. fortuitum strains 10851/ <dig> and 10860/ <dig> including the type strain were identical . the mature porm <dig> from m. fortuitum featured six amino acid substitutions compared to mspa.

since the southern blot experiments had indicated the existence of two genes orthologous to mspa in m. fortuitum, we also attempted to clone and characterise the second porin gene. this porin gene, termed porm <dig>  was amplified by pcr and cloned as a  <dig> bp fragment into the mycobacterial vectors pmv <dig> and pmv <dig>  as described in the section methods. the corresponding recombinant plasmids were named psra <dig> and psrb <dig>  respectively. positive clones were confirmed by sequencing. as shown in figure 2b, the insert of the plasmids contained an orf of  <dig> bp, which turned out to be paralogous to the gene porm <dig>  the  <dig> bp orf encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids with an n-terminal signal sequence of  <dig> amino acids, which was predicted using the signalp  <dig>  server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/signalp/ <cit> . the in silico analysis of the mature porm <dig> showed a calculated molecular weight of the monomer of  <dig> da and a pi of  <dig> , which were very similar to the calculated values of porm <dig>  a hypothetical - <dig> promoter sequence and a hypothetical rbs were located upstream of porm <dig>  a hypothetical terminator sequence was, however, not detected . the similarity between porm <dig> and porm <dig> from strains m. fortuitum 10851/ <dig> and 10860/ <dig> on nucleotide level amounted to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the mspa gene revealed to be more similar to porm <dig>  than to porm <dig> . sequence comparison revealed that porm <dig> encodes a protein mainly differing from porm <dig> within the signal sequence. porm <dig> from m. fortuitum 10851/ <dig> and 10860/ <dig> exhibits an insertion of four amino acids and additional six amino acid exchanges within the signal peptide compared to porm <dig> . only one amino acid is replaced in the mature polypeptide . we sequenced a  <dig> bp region comprising porm <dig>   <dig> bp of its upstream region as well as  <dig> bp downstream of porm <dig>  the dna sequences flanking the porm <dig> and porm <dig> genes revealed no similarity with exception of the  <dig> bp preceding the porm-coding sequences, which were identical in both regions. the 5' terminus of an orf orthologous to a glycosyl transferase gene from m. tuberculosis cdc <dig>  was detected upstream from porm <dig>  an orf orthologous to the gene for a pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase-related protein from m. vanbaalenii  was present in the downstream region of porm <dig> .

using the primer pairs porm2-fw-hind and porm2-bw-hpa or porm2-rna-fw and porm2-rna-bw , porm <dig> was also detected in other strains analysed. no product was obtained using the plasmid pssp <dig> carrying porm <dig> as template, demonstrating the specificity of this pcr approach for porm <dig> 

m. fortuitum strains express less porin compared to m. smegmatis
the expression of the porins porm <dig> and porm <dig> were examined by 2d-electrophoresis, western blotting, elisa and qrt-pcr. for porin protein analysis, m. fortuitum pellets were lysed in pop <dig>  n-octylpolyoxyethylene/ <dig> % edta) that was shown to selectively extract mspa  <cit> . for enhanced resolution and characterisation of the proteins, porin preparations were subjected to 2d-electrophoresis. as shown in figure 5a, about  <dig> protein spots were detected on the 2d-gel in m. fortuitum pop <dig> cell extracts. western blot experiments with identical gels showed only one defined spot detected by the antiserum pak mspa# <dig>  <cit>  . the protein had an apparent molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda, the expected size of the oligomeric porin, and an apparent pi of about  <dig>  which corresponded well to the predicted pi of the mature protein of  <dig> . oligomers of the porin were readily detected in cell extracts of all m. fortuitum strains as well as in extracts from m. smegmatis that served as a positive control. after extended exposition times, the monomer of the porin was also detected on western blots . the western blots showed considerable differences in porin protein expression among the analysed strains . additionally, elisa experiments with pop <dig> extracts were performed to quantify the amount of porin in different strains. different dilutions of cell extracts from the various strains were loaded into the wells of a microtiter plate and porins were detected using the polyclonal antibody pak mspa# <dig>  since m. bovis bcg does not possess orthologous porins  <cit> , extracts of m. bovis bcg were employed as a control to detect the background. amounts higher than  <dig> μg per well turned out to be inapplicable due to saturation effects, and the detection of porin in cell extracts failed at concentrations of about  <dig>  μg per well. therefore, the most eligible working range turned out to be  <dig> μg of cell extract per well. indeed, the amount of porin differed in various strains. the highest amount of porin was detected in the internal control m. smegmatis smr <dig>  the type strain m. fortuitum dsm  <dig> exhibited porin amounts close to those of m. smegmatis, whereas the other two strains showed clearly decreased porin amounts . notably, m. fortuitum 10851/ <dig> exhibited the lowest amount of porin very close to the background, which was represented by the control m. bovis bcg.

comparative expression analysis was also performed by means of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  using sequence-specific primers and probes . the values were compared to porin expression in m. smegmatis. because of the high degree of sequence conservation of the two paralogs porm <dig> and porm <dig>  a qrt-pcr approach was established using primers and a dually labelled probe that hybridised to a region where both genes are identical . this pcr approach enabled the quantification of the overall expression of the paralogs. as was already proven by the elisa results, the highest porin mrna expression was measured in m. smegmatis. it showed transcription rates about twice as high as the highest level among the m. fortuitum strains, which was detected in the type strain m. fortuitum dsm  <dig>  m. fortuitum 10851/ <dig> exhibited the lowest transcription rate among all m. fortuitum strains . the quantification of porm mrna as well as the protein isolated from the various strains demonstrated consistence of transcriptional and translational levels and underlined the differential porin expression among the analysed m. fortuitum strains.

mspa was shown to be accessible on the cell surface of m. smegmatis by using pak mspa# <dig>  <cit> . since the expression analysis showed a differing amount of porin in m. fortuitum strains, m. fortuitum dsm  <dig> and m. fortuitum 10860/ <dig>  were employed for detection of porins at the surface of intact mycobacteria. porins were accessible at the surface of intact cells of m. fortuitum and were detected by the porin-specific antibody. significantly higher absorption at  <dig> nm  was measured for m. fortuitum dsm  <dig> as well as m. fortuitum 10860/ <dig> when compared to the relative backgrounds .

porm expression in the porin-deficient mutant strain m. smegmatis ml <dig> leads to improved growth
heterologous expression of porm <dig> as well as porm <dig> was performed in the porin mutant strain m. smegmatis ml <dig>  to prove the functionality of encoded porins. for this purpose, the plasmids psra <dig> and psra <dig> harbouring porm <dig> and porm <dig>  respectively, were introduced to m. smegmatis ml <dig>  the plasmid pssa <dig>  <cit>  containing mspa was employed as a positive control.

first, the growth on mycobacteria agar plates was quantified during four days after electroporation. the growth was compared to a strain harbouring only the vector pmv <dig>  as it is shown in figure 6a to 6d, heterologous expression of mspa, porm <dig> and porm <dig> led to enhanced growth of complemented strains compared to the control. figure 6a and 6b illustrate the growth retardation of strain m. smegmatis ml <dig>  compared to the mspa-complemented strain m. smegmatis ml <dig> . the growth of m. smegmatis ml <dig> was ameliorated by both, plasmid psra <dig> as well as plasmid psra <dig> , although the complementation of the growth defect by these plasmids was less pronounced than by mspa expression using pssa <dig>  heterologous expression of porm <dig> in the m. smegmatis mutant  resulted in better growth than heterologous expression of porm <dig> .

the quantification of growth rates of the strains by cfu-counting confirmed these conclusions . the strain complemented with mspa  had reached its final number of colonies after  <dig> hours. the transformant complemented with porm <dig>  also showed visible colonies after  <dig> hours, it had, however, not yet reached its final number of colonies after this time period. the strains containing psra <dig>  and the empty vector pmv <dig> both showed visible colonies not until  <dig> hours, but ml <dig>  outnumbered ml <dig> .

knock-down of porm expression by rna antisense technique as well as over-expression of porm <dig> or porm <dig> affect the growth rate of m. fortuitum
knock-down of porin expression in m. fortuitum was performed by generating the plasmid psrr <dig>  which carries a porm antisense fragment  under the control of the hsp <dig> promoter. the employed antisense sequence was first tested for non-specific binding performing a blast search at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi. the analysis ensured that the antisense fragment specifically binds to mspa class porins, such as porms and did not show any hits to other sequences deposited in the database.

the efficiency of down-regulation via rna antisense technique was proven by means of sybr green qrt-pcr using strain 10860/ <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig>  the knock-down strain carrying the plasmid psrr <dig> showed about four times lower porin expression compared to the control strain harbouring the vector pshklx <dig> 

in order to over-express porm genes in m. fortuitum, the coding sequences of porm <dig> from strain m. fortuitum 10851/ <dig> and of porm <dig> from strain 10860/ <dig> were inserted downstream of the hsp <dig> promoter in the vector pmv <dig> to generate plasmids psrb <dig> and psrb <dig>  respectively.

we first studied the impact of the modified porm expression rates on the growth of bacteria freshly transformed with plasmids psrr <dig>  psrb <dig> and psrb <dig> as well as with the empty vectors pshklx <dig> and pmv <dig>  serving as negative controls. strains transformed with pshklx <dig> or psrr <dig> were either selected by adding kanamycin  or hygromycin  to the agar, while transformants electroporated with pmv <dig>  psrb <dig> or psrb <dig> were selected by addition of kanamycin . the clearest results were obtained with strains 10851/ <dig> and dsm  <dig> and are displayed in figure  <dig>  knock-down of porm expression in both strains resulted in considerable growth reduction  substantiating an important role of porins for the growth of m. fortuitum. this was further supported by the growth pattern of the 10851/ <dig> derivatives over-expressing porm <dig> or porm <dig> . compared to 10851/ <dig> containing the empty plasmid pmv <dig>  both derivatives over-expressing porm genes brought about a slight increase in average colony size on plates containing  <dig> μg ml- <dig> kanamycin. this effect was more pronounced in 10851/ <dig> over-expressing porm <dig> than in the strain over-expressing porm <dig>  in dsm  <dig> the porin over-expression had an adverse effect on growth upon plating on  <dig> μg ml- <dig> kanamycin . in order to figure out if this growth decrease was caused by an increased antibiotic uptake, we then plated the over-expressing dsm  <dig> derivatives and the control on plates containing only  <dig> μg ml- <dig> kanamycin . under these conditions, the over-expression of porm genes slightly enhanced the growth. again the increase in average colony size was more pronounced upon over-expression of porm <dig> 

discussion
in recent studies, our research has concentrated on the impact of the cell wall permeability on growth and intracellular persistence of mycobacteria. we were able to show that the porin pathway affects the intracellular persistence of different species in different ways. the findings suggest that intracellular persistence of mycobacteria depends, inter alia, on the balance between "walling-off" towards the hostile environment and the uptake of required compounds in the nutrient-depleted phagosomal environment  <cit> . to further examine this hypothesis, we are searching for more appropriate models. different views have been expressed among scientists about whether m. smegmatis could serve as an appropriate model to study aspects related to virulence of highly pathogenic mycobacteria. a notable number of m. tuberculosis genes that are related to virulence but also play a housekeeping role share closely related orthologs in m. smegmatis. in the case of common mycobacterial genes, m. smegmatis was suggested as an appropriate model organism  <cit> . on the other hand, the physiological differences between m. smegmatis and m. tuberculosis were mentioned to narrow down the significance of direct comparisons  <cit> . mutagenesis of porin genes in m. smegmatis allows the investigation of the impact of cell wall permeability on persistence. however, more appropriate models for such studies must naturally be able to survive and multiply intracellularly. additionally, they must possess a known class of porin. these conditions are fulfilled by m. fortuitum, which was recently suggested as a model mycobacterium  <cit> . this species is able to infect and grow in phagocytic cells  <cit>  and also possesses porins orthologous to mspa. we therefore decided to identify and characterise porin genes from m. fortuitum.

the results of this study show that different strains – including the type strain – of m. fortuitum possess orthologous porins of the mspa class. the amino acid sequences of porm <dig> and porm <dig> are highly conserved among the strains, whereas there is variability in their nucleotide sequence. porm <dig> and porm <dig> have the same apparent molecular mass as mspa and mspc, respectively. they are accessible at the surface of m. fortuitum. in detergent extracts of m. fortuitum mature oligomers of porms were detected, similar to m. smegmatis porin oligomers. as oligomer formation is necessary for channel activity  <cit> , it can be concluded that m. fortuitum porins form functional pores in the om. mature porm <dig> from m. fortuitum differs at only six amino acid positions from mspa. according to the studies of faller et al.  <cit>  and mahfoud et al.  <cit>  about the structure of mspa and its topology in the om of m. smegmatis, it can be assumed that the amino acid replacements between porm <dig> and mspa do not significantly affect the general porin structure. remarkably, most of the exchanges are restricted to those residues, which are also variable within the msp family. for example, the replacement of alanine <dig> with proline in the extracellular loop l <dig> between the β-sheets  <dig> and  <dig> supports the tight turn between the β-sheets and the change of direction. interestingly, porm <dig> does not feature the mentioned exchange of alanine with proline, which is the only amino acid exchange in the mature protein between porm <dig> and porm <dig>  faller et al.  <cit>  proposed that the adjacent replacement of serine <dig> with lysine changes the antigenic properties of mspd compared to the other isomers. although porms have the same exchange, they were readily detectable using a polyclonal antibody raised against mspa. the exchange of asparagine <dig> with glutamic acid within the periplasmatic loop l <dig> introduces a negative charge into the channel and may thus change the permeation properties slightly  <cit> . the replacement of isoleucine <dig> with threonine within the β-sheet β <dig> should not affect the protein structure either, since both amino acids are c-beta branched amino acids and it is more favourable for them to lie between β-sheets  <cit> .

the capacity of the encoded porins porm <dig> and porm <dig> to fulfil the function of a porin was tested in complementation experiments by introducing these genes into the double mutant strain m. smegmatis ml <dig>  and observing the growth rate. interestingly, porm <dig> had a stronger complementation effect than porm <dig>  which was indicated by faster appearance of colonies and larger colony sizes on plates after electroporation. this may be explained by the higher similarity of porm <dig> to mspa, which represents the main porin gene in m. smegmatis  <cit> . the antiserum raised against mspa binds well to porms, and the growth defect of the mutant strain m. smegmatis ml <dig> is reduced after complementation with porm <dig> and porm <dig>  all mentioned features indicate similar functions and characteristics of the porins from m. smegmatis and m. fortuitum.

as mentioned above, mature porm <dig> only differs from the mature porm <dig> in one amino acid. more remarkable differences occur in the signal peptide of the two porins. the calculated cleavage site  of the signal peptides of porm <dig>  porm <dig>  mspa and mspc is identical. however, the length of the signal peptides differs. while porm <dig> and mspa have signal peptides composed of  <dig> amino acids, porm <dig> and mspc possess extended signal peptides consisting of  <dig> amino acids. the length and primary structure of the signal peptide could be important for the transport and integration of the particular porin to the mycobacterial om. it will be very informative to analyse the different regulation mechanisms determining the importance of the two genes for growth under different environmental conditions.

it was interesting that the expression of porm genes both at the transcriptional level and at the translational level consistently differed among the analysed strains as shown by the three employed approaches . the results of both quantitative assays show the lowest porin expression among m. fortuitum strains in 10851/ <dig> followed by 10860/ <dig> and the type strain. the use of a polyclonal antibody, which recognises different epitopes of the protein and the consistency among the results of three different approaches allows drawing the conclusion that the porin expression in m. fortuitum is lower compared to m. smegmatis and also varies between the different strains. the high sequence conservation of the two paralogs porm <dig> and porm <dig> does not allow their expressions to be distinguished. therefore, we consider the expression rates as overall values of both paralogs. as shown by qrt-pcr and elisa, the porin expression in different strains of m. fortuitum was significantly lower than that of m. smegmatis. it was shown that m. smegmatis possesses  <dig> mspa-like pores per μm <dig> cell wall  <cit> . since the analysed strains of m. fortuitum exhibited a clearly lower porm expression both at the transcriptional and the translational level, the amount of pores in the cell wall of m. fortuitum must be distinctly lower than  <dig> pores per μm <dig> cell wall. according to our results, the amount of mspa-like pores in the analysed strains of m. fortuitum varies between  <dig> in m. fortuitum dsm  <dig> and less than  <dig> per μm <dig> cell wall in m. fortuitum 10851/ <dig>  which exhibits the lowest amount of porin at all. it is interesting that the strain exhibiting the lowest porin expression is identical with the strain showing the slowest growth rate. this finding supports the hypothesis that porins play an important part in determining the generation time of mycobacteria.

to investigate the impact of the porins porm <dig> and porm <dig> on the growth rate of m. fortuitum, we generated strains over-expressing porm <dig> or porm <dig>  additionally, m. fortuitum knock-down strains were generated by antisense technique. this technique has contributed to the clarification of the function of many mycobacterial genes. advantages are the possibility to analyse essential genes whose mutagenesis would be lethal and to repress genes present in several copies. some examples of the application of the antisense technique in mycobacteria are the repression of ahpc from m. bovis  <cit> , dnaa from m. smegmatis  <cit> , fap-p from m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis  <cit> , pknf from m. tuberculosis  <cit>  or mdp <dig> from m. bovis bcg  <cit> . a further advantage of knocking-down genes by antisense technique can be the possibility to repress paralogous genes in the same bacterium. as described in dryselius et al.  <cit> , the most effective region for antisense inhibition is the region covering the shine-dalgarno sequence and the start codon. the authors furthermore show, that antisense rnas of only 10– <dig> bases exhibit strong inhibitory effects on gene expression. the antisense fragment used in this study is identical to the corresponding region of porm <dig>  while it displays a homology of  <dig> % to porm <dig>  the antisense fragment and porm <dig> still exhibit long stretches of identical nucleic acid sequences. of particular importance is the similarity in the beginning of the antisense fragment covering the shine-dalgarno sequence and the start codon . we therefore are convinced that a down-regulation of both, porm <dig> as well as porm <dig>  may be achieved using the strategy described in this study. deletion- or insertion mutagenesis of either porm <dig> or porm <dig> might result in complementation of the deleted porin gene by the remaining one. such an effect has been observed in m. smegmatis, where the deletion of the mspa gene caused the activation of the transcription of mspb and/or mspd  <cit> . mutagenesis of both porin genes in the same derivative, on the other hand, would probably restrain the diffusion across the om to an extent compromising cellular functions.

the effects of an over-expression of porin in our m. fortuitum strains depended on characteristics of the strains as well as the amount of kanamycin added to the medium. the over-expression of porm <dig> and porm <dig> showed the most considerable influence on growth rate in strain 10851/ <dig>  among the tested strains, 10851/ <dig> has the slowest growth rate and produces least porin. therefore, this strain probably benefits most from a better nutrient supply caused by porin over-production. otherwise, the adverse effect of kanamycin on the growth rate was most pronounced in strain dsm  <dig>  which expresses the highest amount of porin among the analysed strains. disposing of a relatively high amount of porin, this strain probably takes less advantage of an ameliorated nutrient supply and instead suffers most from more kanamycin diffusion into the cells. when the kanamycin concentration in the plates was reduced to  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  the over-expressing dsm  <dig> derivatives did not show any growth inhibition compared to the control strain and even had a slight growth advantage. it seems that at this kanamycin concentration the beneficial effects of better nutrient influx slightly exceed the adverse effects of better antibiotic influx. the changes in growth behaviour in 10851/ <dig> as well as in dsm  <dig> were more pronounced upon over-expression of porm <dig> compared to over-expression of porm <dig>  the down-regulation of the expression of porm <dig> together with porm <dig> by antisense-technology reduced the growth of both m. fortuitum strains to a similar and very low level suggesting that lack of porins in the knock-down strains strongly impairs the nutrient supply.

our observations point to a passage of kanamycin through the porm porins. studies performed with m. smegmatis gave rise to contrarious conclusions  <cit> . stephan et al.  <cit>  observed no reduction of kanamycin resistance in a mspa mutant compared to the m. smegmatis wild type strain and danilchanka and colleagues  <cit>  had postulated using structural models that due to its size kanamycin cannot diffuse through the mspa porin. these differing results may in part be explained by the use of different experimental systems. stephan et al.  <cit>  employed a mutant strain, while we observed differential effects of kanamycin only in over-expressing strains. furthermore, stephan et al.  <cit>  performed their studies with m. smegmatis and we observed strong strain-dependent variations even among different isolates within the same species. the amino acid exchanges occurring between mspa on the one hand and porm <dig> and porm <dig> on the other hand may be responsible for differences in channel properties of these porins and influence their permeability for kanamycin.

as we discussed earlier, the growth rate of mycobacteria may contribute to their pathogenicity  <cit> . hence, it can be suggested that the low porin expression in m. fortuitum strains isolated from human patients compared to saprophytic species of rgm like m. smegmatis contributes to higher pathogenicity caused by an enhanced ability to multiply intracellularly. interestingly, it was shown that the mspa expression in m. smegmatis is specifically downregulated at acidic ph  <cit> . moreover, the m. tuberculosis porin ompatb, which belongs to the ompa class of porins has been shown to be necessary for the persistence in the acidic milieu enabling m. tuberculosis to respond to reduced environmental ph  <cit> . although the mspa like porins do not belong to the ompa class of porins, the results of these studies underline the role of porins concerning the intracellular persistence of mycobacteria.

an interesting result from various genome-sequencing projects of mycobacteria is that genome sizes of rgm and the pathogenic slow-growing mycobacteria largely differ. highly pathogenic species like m. tuberculosis and m. leprae have genome sizes of about  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively. on the other hand, m. smegmatis has a genome size of about  <dig> mb, which is similar to that of the related actinomycete streptomyces coelicolor. brosch et al.  <cit>  reviewed different data such as 16s rrna sequences or genome sizes and suggested that the branch of slow-growing mycobacteria represents the part of the genus that has evolved most recently. they proposed that the loss of genes rather than gain of genetic material by horizontal transfer contributed both to the pathogenicity of slow-growing mycobacteria and to the fine-tuning of their virulence. loss of efficient porins of the mspa class or a decreased density of porins in the om plays an important role to "wall-off" toward the hostile phagosomal environment and thus is of particular importance for the evolution of a successful intracellular pathogen. the presence of several copies of porin genes and, in turn, a high density of efficient porins in the om of m. smegmatis would provide a selective advantage for saprophytes. a decreased amount of efficient porins in the om of pathogenic rgm like m. fortuitum may represent an evolutionary intermediate stage between saprophytic mycobacteria like m. smegmatis and the highly pathogenic slow-growing mycobacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides detailed information about porin genes of the mspa class in m. fortuitum and their importance for the growth rate and susceptibility to antibiotics. our future studies will concentrate on the elucidation of the role of porm <dig> and porm <dig> in survival and replication of phagocytosed m. fortuitum.
