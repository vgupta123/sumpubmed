BACKGROUND
recent comparative genomics studies have revealed how the human genome has been shaped by various evolutionary forces. some regions in the human genome are strongly conserved among many mammalian species  <cit> , while others have seen accelerated change in the human lineage compared to other species  <cit> . some regions, the so-called "gene clusters", are composed of multiple similar copies of gene-containing segments in close proximity. because such structurally complex regions have been implicated in human genetic diseases, their study has become of great interest. for example, the number of gene copies in the ccl cluster influences susceptibility to hiv  <cit> , the ifn cluster is associated with sarcoidosis  <cit> , and the cyp2abf cluster is implicated in lung cancer  <cit> .

analyzing the evolution of biomedically relevant gene clusters can inform studies aiming to discover the molecular mechanisms underlying their genetic disease association . however, gene clusters are difficult to analyze because they contain multiple similar genomic regions, and tend to have complex evolutionary histories involving a variety of large-scale mutation events . one of the key problems in analyzing gene clusters lies in distinguishing between orthologs, defined as genes that derive from speciation events, from paralogs, defined as genes that derive from duplication events. traditional efforts to trace the relationships among these regions have focused on constructing a phylogenetic tree or a multiple alignment of homologous sequences, but these approaches suffer from uncertainty problems whereby different methods can produce substantially different results  <cit> . even when using a single method, the tree topology of a sequence dataset can change depending on which region is selected  <cit> . one of the main factors confounding such evolutionary analyses is the phenomenon of conversion between paralogs , where sequence from one region overwrites part of a similar paralogous region via the recombinational machinery . this is sometimes called "gene conversion", though it does not necessarily involve any genes. it is typically caused by dna double-strand breaks or by a double holliday junction dissolution mechanism  <cit> . previous genome-wide studies of conversion revealed that such events have occurred quite often . moreover, some of these paralogs have undergone recurring conversion events, complicating matters even further.

many computational methods have been devised for detecting gene conversion . according to our evaluation study  <cit> , the method we developed  <cit>  outperformed the others tested when applied to gene cluster data and both sensitivity and false discovery rate were taken into account. in addition, the other methods for detecting converted regions pose the inconvenience of requiring a multiple sequence alignment for each set of homologous sequences. here, we report the development of an easy-to-use software package called chap  for detecting conversion events using gene cluster sequences from multiple species. chap uses the conversion-detection method from  <cit> , which is based on a statistical test proposed by  <cit> . the chap package includes procedures for identifying all pairwise orthologs required by the conversion-detection method, utilizing an extension of our cage program  <cit> . thus, users only need to prepare sequence datasets for their gene clusters of interest, and provide an overall phylogenetic tree for the species involved. the package also includes an extended version of our gmaj viewer  <cit> , which provides a convenient way to examine the detected conversion events. the entire chap package is available for free download from our website at http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab. users will also need the well-known repeatmasker program  <cit> , which is available from http://www.repeatmasker.org.

chap includes the following differences from our previous program  <cit> .  chap focuses on analyzing gene clusters rather than entire genomes. in particular, it incorporates an ortholog identifier specifically designed for dealing with the clusters' complex evolutionary histories  <cit> , whereas the program from  <cit>  relies on external, generic ortholog assignments.  it detects conversion events in multiple related species at once, not just a single primary species as in  <cit> .  it leverages the multi-species conversion data to estimate the time of the events in the species tree.  it includes an additional, alternative test criterion that enables it to detect conversions covering entire paralogs, which were missed by  <cit> .  it provides a visualization tool to help users easily investigate the conversion results.

we used chap to analyze conversion events in five primate gene clusters. this involved using a combination of sequences available from public sources and newly generated ones . the clusters were chosen based on their relevance to human health, recent duplications in the human lineage, and small size: β-globin , α-globin , ccl , ifn , and cyp2abf .

RESULTS
overview of detecting conversion events affecting gene clusters
a conversion event produces a within-species alignment where one part is better conserved than other parts. to distinguish this from variation caused by natural selection, our method compares the alignment of paralogs with that of an ortholog in another species to factor out the effects of purifying selection. the use of sequence from an outgroup species that split from the species of interest after the duplication that gave rise to the paralogs, but before the conversion event, can help to illuminate the situation.

to illustrate the general idea, suppose these conversion, outgroup speciation, and duplication events occurred x, y, and z years ago, respectively , forming regions a <dig> and a <dig> in primary species a and regions b <dig> and b <dig> in outgroup species b . thus before the conversion, a <dig> is orthologous to b <dig> and a <dig> to b <dig>  while a <dig> is paralogous to a <dig> and b <dig> to b <dig> by the definitions of orthology and paralogy  <cit> . let dist denote the evolutionary distance between two regions x and y. the distance between species a and b is 2y because a and b split y years ago, so in the absence of conversion, we expect dist = 2y and dist = 2y. similarly, for the paralogs we expect dist = 2z and dist = 2z. however, the conversion event causes dist = 2x and dist = 2z instead. whenever we observe two paralogous regions a <dig> and a <dig> and an outgroup species b such that dist < = dist and dist < = dist, but dist > dist and dist > dist when a <dig> is orthologous to b <dig> and a <dig> to b <dig>  then we infer a conversion event between a <dig> and a <dig>  note that our statistical method was designed for unequal rates of evolution as well as a molecular clock, although we illustrate only the latter case here for simplicity.

the chap pipeline takes as input a set of fasta sequences from a number of species for a particular gene cluster, together with a phylogenetic tree describing the overall relationships among the species. with a single command, it detects conversion events in all of the species using the others as outgroups. figure  <dig> illustrates the steps. first, all self alignments  and pairwise inter-species alignments are generated  using the lastz aligner  <cit> . next, the cage software  <cit>  uses a combinatorial approach to identify all pairwise orthologs in the alignment data, according to the definition of orthology in  <cit> ; its output is a subset of the inter-species alignments, also in maf format. then, our conversion detector  <cit>  examines each pair of paralogous regions, together with their orthologs in each outgroup species, and performs several statistical tests to infer conversion events . the primary output from this step is a tab-separated text file listing the conversion observations for each combination of reference and outgroup species, which are grouped into unique events  and localized to a particular sub-lineage in the phylogenetic tree. finally, a second command invokes an extended version of our gmaj viewer  <cit>  to visualize the detected conversion observations in a chosen species using an interactive, graphical display. figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show examples of conversion events detected and visualized by chap.

conversion events affecting the primate β-globin cluster
the human β-globin cluster is composed of five genes : hbe , hbg <dig> , hbg <dig> , hbd , and hbb . each gene contains three exons separated by two introns. the human cluster also includes a well-known pseudogene hbh  located between the γ <dig> and δ genes. the human sequence and annotation data for this cluster were obtained from the ucsc genome browser . we downloaded the sequences of  <dig> other primate species from the genbank and ensembl databases, and obtained gene annotation information for the non-human primate species using the genewise program  <cit> . the non-human primate species were used by the chap pipeline as outgroups to detect conversion events in the human lineage. we also used dog and elephant sequences from the ucsc genome browser as additional outgroup species.

evidence suggests that the common ancestor of the primates had a structure of 5'-ε-γ-η-δ-β-3' in this cluster  <cit> . except for γ1/γ <dig>  duplication events among these genes predate the split of primate species  <cit> , i.e. the sequence similarities of two paralogs among those genes are usually lower than the similarities to their orthologs in other primate species  <cit> . however, figure 4a shows a case where a region containing the first exon and part of the first intron of the human δ gene has a higher sequence similarity to its paralog β than to its marmoset ortholog, while the ortholog pair shows the expected higher similarity levels than the paralogs in the flanking regions and other parts of human δ. chap detected that the blue-shaded region of human δ was copied from human β via a conversion event. this conversion inference is strongly supported by a p-value of  <dig>  * 10-5; it also agrees with other studies of evolutionary relationships in the β-globin cluster .

previous studies on the duplication of the γ <dig> and γ <dig> genes have traced that tandem duplication to a time before the split of the catarrhine primates  although sequence comparison of γ <dig> and γ <dig> shows a high similarity level at about 98% identity . this has been reported as an example of gene conversion  <cit> . chap detected a conversion event in the human γ <dig> gene copied from γ <dig>  e.g. when using gibbon as the outgroup . our result indicates that this conversion includes the flanking regions of the two γ genes as well as their exons and introns, in total involving approximately  <dig> bp. in addition to these two main conversion events in the human β-globin cluster, there are several minor ones as well .

conversion in the α-globin cluster and events covering entire paralogs
the human α-globin gene has the same origin as the β-globin gene, i.e., both were generated via duplication about  <dig> million years ago from a common ancestral globin gene  <cit> . since then, they have formed their current clusters independently  <cit> . similar to the β-globin cluster, the human α-globin cluster comprises five genes : hbz-t <dig> , hbk , hba-t <dig> , hba-t <dig> , and hbq . each gene contains three exons separated by two introns. in addition, there are two well-known pseudogenes: hbz-t <dig>  and hba-t <dig> . we obtained sequences and annotation information for human and  <dig> non-human primate species, cow, and elephant for the α-globin cluster as above for the β-globin cluster . we then ran the chap pipeline to detect conversion events in this cluster.

one of the interesting results in the human α-globin cluster is a conversion involving the α <dig> and α <dig> globin genes. the duplication giving rise to these paralogs predates the separation of the apes from new world monkeys  <cit> . however, the evolutionary distance between these paralogous sequences is less than that between α <dig> and its ortholog in colobus monkey . the ortholog situation is straightforward, since the colobus orthologs that the cage step identified for the human α <dig> and α <dig> genes are one-to-one; i.e. cage does not find any post-speciation duplications involving α <dig> or α <dig> in either the human or colobus lineages, so the human paralogs are mapped to single, distinct regions in colobus. nevertheless, the original criterion used in  <cit>  cannot detect the conversion event shown in figure 6a because that criterion requires switch points of percentage identity differences between paralogs and orthologs, as shown in figure  <dig> and figure 6b. the reason that such pattern switches do not appear in figure 6a is that nearly the entire sequence is involved in the conversion, so there are insufficient flanking regions for performing the test. to detect such events, we added a new criterion to the conversion detector in our chap pipeline that does not require flanking regions . as a result, chap was able to detect this event, where according to the colobus outgroup,  <dig> bp of the human paralog containing α <dig> overwrote the corresponding part of the α <dig> paralog. this observation is supported by a p-value of  <dig>  * 10- <dig>  the same event is also observed using other outgroups, though some of them show the opposite direction of conversion and different endpoints for the converted region.

another interesting conversion occurred between paralogs containing the human α <dig> gene and α <dig> pseudogene . the duplication forming α <dig> and α <dig> predates the separation of the simian primates from prosimians  <cit> . since the conversion can be observed using gibbon as the outgroup sequence, we conclude that it occurred after the separation of hominids from other apes. although the human α <dig> region is a pseudogene, its 3'-flanking region still has a sequence similar to that of the protein-coding gene α <dig> due to the recent conversion event. we speculate that this conversion may play a role in conserving some function associated with the 3'-flanking regions of α <dig> and α <dig>  the α <dig> pseudogene is present as a pseudogene in several species, which suggests that it is somewhat important, given that it lost function several million years ago yet is still around in some of the species examined. further, its ortholog in prosimians is an active gene.

the conversion events detected here include those originally described for the duplicated α-globin genes in humans  <cit> . also, the "gradient of gene conversion"  <cit>  is apparent in the declining percent identity of the converted dna segments in the 3' flanking regions of the α <dig> and α <dig> genes . this gradient was attributed to repeated gene conversions over evolutionary time. by examining the patterns of conversion detected using outgroups over increasing phylogenetic distance, chap inferred three different conversion events in the 3' flanking regions of the α <dig> and α <dig> genes, and estimated the time of each event as illustrated in figure 7b. for instance, event  <dig> in figure  <dig> is a recent conversion that happened after the split of human and chimpanzee, while event  <dig> occurred before their separation. note that the conversion time for event  <dig> is difficult to determine precisely because we do not have sufficient information from many of the species , whereas event  <dig> has eight outgroup results supporting the inference that it followed the separation of human and gibbon.

all of the conversion events detected by the pipeline in the human lineage of the α-globin cluster are shown in figure  <dig>  which displays them on a human self-alignment together with inter-species alignments between human and the outgroups used for the event detection. in total,  <dig> conversion events were detected, all involving paralogs containing ζ <dig>  ζ <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  and/or α <dig> 

summary of conversion events in five human gene clusters
in addition to the β-globin and α-globin clusters, we obtained sequences for three more gene clusters: ccl, ifn, and cyp2abf. for these studies, comparative sequence data were generated from seven additional primate species in these clusters, indicated by "*" in figure  <dig> 

we analyzed conversion events in the human lineage for these five clusters using the chap package. as shown in figure  <dig>  conversions are quite frequent in all of these clusters. here, we classify the events into two categories: criterion  <dig> or  <dig>  criterion  <dig> means that the event was detected using the original triplet or quadruplet tests from  <cit> , while criterion  <dig> is the new method for detecting events covering the entire paralogous sequence , without sufficient unconverted flanking regions needed for criterion  <dig>  figure 10a shows the number of events detected by each criterion in the five clusters. of the  <dig> total events,  <dig> % were detected by criterion  <dig> 

to examine the conversion frequency, we first computed the fraction of paralogous sequence pairs showing conversion, displayed in the blue bars of figure 10b. there were a total of  <dig> paralogous sequence pairs in the five clusters, and of these,  <dig>  experienced at least one conversion event. by this measure, the α-globin cluster is the most active of the five, with  <dig> % of its pairs showing evidence of conversion.

we also computed the conversion frequency using the number of bases instead of paralogous pairs, shown in the red bars of figure 10b. a total of  <dig>  bases in the five clusters lie in duplicated regions, and  <dig> % of them have been involved in a conversion at least once. this fraction is almost twice the one based on the number of pairs. in this comparison based on the number of bases, the α-globin cluster again shows the highest conversion frequency, with  <dig> % of its duplicated bases involved in conversions. according to both measures, the ccl cluster experienced the least conversion activity.

in addition to the conversion frequencies in the general paralogous sequences, we also analyzed the incidence of conversion in protein-coding exons . on average, nearly 50% of the coding bases were involved in at least one conversion. in the β-globin and ifn clusters, this rose to more than 70%. the frequent conversion events between the coding regions serve to homogenize paralogs within species, which could contribute to the establishment of species-specific characteristics. furthermore, conversions that copy non-coding sequences into coding regions  can introduce new functionality more quickly than point mutations, since many nucleotides are changed by a single event. ifn and ccl are involved in immune response to infection by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, or tumor cells, and the cyp <dig> genes play crucial roles in the metabolism of exogenous substances such as drugs or carcinogens. thus gene conversion may be an effective evolutionary mechanism facilitating adaptation to environmental changes.

some paralogous pairs are involved in conversions more than once. figure 10c shows how many pairs in each cluster experienced various numbers of conversion events. about 10% of the paralogous pairs in the β-globin and α-globin clusters had at least two sequential events, and this figure was at least 4% for the other three clusters.

we also computed the proportion of bases involved in multiple conversions, either as source or target, out of all bases in duplicated regions . more than 20% of the duplicated bases in the β-globin, α-globin, and ifn clusters were involved in conversion events at least twice. in the ifn cluster, about 10% were involved in four or more events.

in addition, we identified the "hot-spot" protein-coding gene in each cluster according to the number of conversion events involving coding exons, either as donor or recipient .

the protein-coding gene in each cluster showing the most conversion events involving exons. positions are given with respect to the ucsc hg <dig> assembly.

when conversions occur in protein-coding genes, the functions of the genes may be affected. for example, we detected recurrent conversions between the human β- and δ-globin genes. evidence for a similar but presumably much more recent event has been reported in a patient exhibiting mild microcytosis, whose δ-globin gene contained part of the amino acid sequence of the β-globin gene  <cit> . the authors of that report hypothesized that this could have been due to a new gene conversion.

the human cyp2a <dig> gene as a hot-spot for conversions in the cyp2abf cluster
to examine the effect of conversion events on gene function, we focused on the cyp2a <dig> gene from table  <dig>  chap detected seven conversion events, all overwriting parts of this gene with donor sequences from elsewhere, and together they involved all nine of cyp2a13's coding exons . interestingly, except for one event the donor paralogs are entirely non-coding, and according to annotation data from ncbi, none are considered to be pseudogenes. it is somewhat surprising that the gene is still functional, in spite of being overwritten with non-coding sequences so many times.

the cyp2a <dig> gene encodes an enzyme which metabolizes a tobacco-specific carcinogen, nnk -1--1-butanone)  <cit> . nnk is activated by the metabolism, leading to its carcinogenicity  <cit> . the gene is intensively expressed in the respiratory tract  <cit> , and it has been studied as a candidate gene associated with tobacco-related cancers, such as lung cancers. in particular, the variations arg25gln and arg257cys have been shown to relate to metabolic activities involving nnk  <cit> . the minor alleles, gln and cys, decrease the activities of the enzyme as well as the gene expression, and could produce lesser toxicity of nnk in smokers  <cit> .

to investigate the effects of conversions on the cyp2a <dig> coding sequences, we compared sites in these regions that are polymorphic in the human population against the nucleotide sequences of the donor regions. in particular, we used non-synonymous snp sites from the ncbi dbsnp database in the converted cyp2a <dig> exon regions, and looked for cases where the mutant allele of the snp matches the donor sequence of a conversion detected in this study . the mutant allele was determined under the assumption that the gorilla orthologous sequence is the ancestral type. indeed, the donor sequences for the 25th and 257th amino acids of cyp2a <dig> do match the minor alleles, which are also the mutant alleles. we also found four other non-synonymous snps in this gene whose mutant alleles share the same nucleotides as the donor sequences. this frequent sharing could be explained by recurrent conversions from the donor sequences in the human population, as an alternative to point mutations alone. thus we suggest that recent conversions, perhaps tending to recapitulate ancestral ones, may contribute to polymorphism and phenotypic variation in humans. 

conversion in drosophila melanogaster paralogs
conversion in the d. melanogaster genome has been studied by many researchers . approximately  <dig> % of its paralogous genes have experienced conversion  <cit> . to explore the applicability of chap for studying non-mammalian sequences, we used it to analyze a gene cluster where we suspected the occurrence of conversion.

the genomic region dm <dig> chr2l: <dig> ,900- <dig> , <dig>   <cit>  contains three paralogous genes , which are associated with lipase activity and lipid metabolic processes  <cit> . the cg <dig> and cg <dig> genes comprise five exons each, while cg <dig> has four. we located the corresponding genomic region in d. yakuba  using inter-species lastz alignments for use as an outgroup. chap detected a 1354-bp conversion event between the cg <dig> and cg <dig> genes that involves their last four exons and three introns . it is interesting to note that the conversion event maintained the exon-intron structure of the 3' portion of these two genes while the 5' structure of the genes diversified.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed the chap package for detecting conversion events in gene clusters, and used this computational tool for analyzing five human gene clusters. we found that  <dig> % of the paralogous sequence pairs in those clusters have undergone at least one conversion event. this is somewhat higher than the genome-wide frequency  for all human paralog pairs  <cit> , and confirms that conversion is a common phenomenon that must be accounted for when studying gene cluster evolution. interestingly, some paralogs have experienced conversion events repeatedly in the same intervals; this can be detected if the later ones change narrower regions in the target.

to detect the occurrence of conversion events and their boundaries, we used a statistical test based on two criteria: the original triplet and quadruplet tests implemented in  <cit> , and a new alternative test for events covering most or all of their respective paralogous sequences, which was implemented by extending the original detector. both criteria achieve comparable statistical rigor by calculating a p-value for each event. we have compared our conversion detector pipeline  to other existing methods available for detecting conversion events, and the overall accuracy of our method  was superior to the others when applied to gene cluster data  <cit> . the quality of the non-parametric statistical test used in our conversion detector was also evaluated in  <cit> .

chap works best when sequences are available from many species, because even if a conversion cannot be detected using one particular primary or outgroup species , it may still be detected using others. in addition, using more species in the analysis enables more precise estimation of conversion times. however, as illustrated in the drosophila example above, even one outgroup sequence is often sufficient to find conversions.

accurate detection of conversion events can contribute substantially to other studies of gene cluster evolution by correcting duplication ages distorted by conversion and by improving the identification of orthology relationships in complex gene clusters. for example, the orthology assigned by cage is based on the positions where duplications occurred and the species in which they are seen . the orthology mappings based on this definition are suitable for our purpose of conversion detection. however, other studies may require orthology mappings based on a different definition: if we trace the orthology based on the origin of the sequence contents rather than the positions of duplication, conversion events can change the mappings . this alternative concept of "orthology by content" corresponds to the mosaic structures of phylogenetic trees  <cit> , and is necessary for certain types of evolutionary analysis, such as determining the rate of synonymous substitutions in coding regions. in fact, it may not even be appropriate to analyze synonymous substitution rates in genes subject to frequent conversion events, because their nucleotide changes are not introduced according to a poisson process, but rather as segments of changes. for both concepts of orthology, chap can lead to more accurate ortholog identification that is essential for constructing multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees. finally, our ongoing efforts in this area can help to more accurately model the full complexity of evolutionary processes, and to improve software for the analysis of gene cluster evolution.
