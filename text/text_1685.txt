BACKGROUND
yb- <dig> is a multifunctional protein known to interact with nucleic acids, and as such, yb- <dig> is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes in eukaryotic cells . in the cytoplasm, yb- <dig> participates in the formation of mrnps and in the regulation of mrna translation and degradation  <cit> . in the nucleus, yb- <dig> functions as a y-box binding transcription factor, where it activates transcription of various cellular genes, including those implicated in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis . translocation of yb- <dig> from cytoplasm to the cell nucleus can occur at certain steps of the cell cycle  <cit>  and in response to stress-induced dna damages  <cit> . the association of yb- <dig> with nucleic acids causes global changes in their structures by melting short or imperfect duplexes and acceleration of annealing and strand exchange reactions between complementary strands of rna and dna  <cit> . yb- <dig> may thus participate in dna recombination and replication  <cit> , and in the case of damaged dna, yb- <dig> may assist in its reparation.

molecular and structural investigations showed that yb- <dig> interacts with rna and dna through two non-homologous domains: the cold-shock domain , which consists of five anti-parallel beta-strands  <cit> , and the c-terminal domain, which contains a series of alternating clusters of positively and negatively charged amino acid residues.

in addition to its interaction with nucleic acids, yb- <dig> interplays with different protein partners within the cell. it has been noticed that the interaction of yb- <dig> with p <dig> increases the affinity of p <dig> for dna promoters that could stimulate transcription of p53-controled genes  <cit> . similarly, yb- <dig> interacts with the t-antigen of polyomavirus jc and triggers transcription of viral genes  <cit> . yb- <dig> can also catalyze splicing of pre-mrna via interaction with rna polymerase ii, ews  and tls  proteins  <cit> .

the objective of the present work was to identify new yb- <dig> protein partners to better understand the functions of this protein. we discovered, using a series of biochemical in vitro experiments, that yb- <dig> strongly interacts with tubulin, both soluble and polymerized into microtubules. we demonstrated that yb- <dig> stimulates microtubule assembly, and in addition, that tubulin competes with mrna for interaction with yb- <dig>  in light of these results, we propose that yb- <dig> may contribute to coordination of regulation of mrna translation and dynamics of microtubule cytoskeleton. tubulin, via its interaction with yb- <dig>  may indirectly influence the translational regulation of mrnp complexes.

RESULTS
tubulin is a new yb- <dig> interacting protein
a search for new yb- <dig> partners from different rabbit tissue extracts was performed by affinity chromatography using yb-1-sepharose as bait. though eluates varied in protein composition, two prominent bands migrating as  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda were detected in the eluates of most of the tissues . the  <dig> kda protein was identified by maldi-tof mass spectrometry as actin, a well-characterized yb- <dig> partner  <cit>  and the  <dig> kda band was identified by similar means as tubulin . the presence of tubulin in extract and eluate fractions was also confirmed by western blotting using anti-alpha and anti-beta tubulin antibodies. as shown on fig. 1b, α and β tubulin subunits were detected in all tissue extracts and high salt eluates. it is interesting to note that, in the case of brain and testis, some tubulin remained in the flow-through fraction. this could be either due to the saturation of the affinity column or linked to the sequestration of tubulin with partner proteins. in the control experiments performed with bsa-sepharose, all tissue proteins were collected in the flow-through fractions and were undetectable in high salt eluates . these results strongly suggested that tubulin binds specifically to yb- <dig> 

we further investigated yb-1:tubulin interaction and evaluated the stability of the yb-1-tubulin complex by yb- <dig> affinity chromatography using pure tubulin as a prey. tubulin was totally adsorbed on the yb-1-sepharose column in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl, while poorly retained in similar conditions by a casein-sepharose control column . tubulin started to elute from the yb- <dig> column at  <dig> mm nacl forming a peak around  <dig> mm nacl . these results indicate that the yb-1:tubulin interaction is not inhibited at physiological and moderate ionic strength . we finally probed the presence of yb- <dig> and of α and β tubulin subunits in yb-1-tubulin complexes by cross-linking using the zero length cross-linker edc/sulfo nhs. as displayed on fig.  <dig>  cross-linker stabilized dimeric forms of yb- <dig> and α β-tubulin heterodimers, as well as higher molecular weight aggregates . it is worthy to note that under these conditions, both yb- <dig> and tubulin cross-linked samples still contained non-cross-linked products . when the cross-linking reaction was performed in the presence of both proteins at a yb-1-tubulin molar ratio of  <dig> , most yb- <dig> was found in high-molecular weight complexes containing also both tubulin subunits . an increase of the yb-1:tubulin molar ratio over  <dig>  increased the yield of these high molecular weight complexes  with a slight increase of the free yb- <dig> band. our results demonstrate that yb- <dig> interacts directly with tubulin and suggest that yb- <dig> contacts the both tubulin subunits in solution.

the binding of yb- <dig> to tubulin was then investigated by afm. yb- <dig> appeared as discrete particles on the mica surface with an average height of  <dig>  nm . this value appeared lower than that reported by skabkin et al  <cit>   and probably resulted from yb- <dig> flattening on the mica surface. tubulin appeared as particles with an average height of  <dig>  nm  in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . in the yb-1-tubulin sample, in contrast to isolated proteins, particles were less homogenous with a size distribution ranging from about  <dig> to  <dig> nm . a novel class of particles was clearly distinguishable, centered around  <dig> nm. it was attributed to the yb-1-tubulin complexes probably made of several molecules of both tubulin and yb- <dig> 

yb- <dig> strongly favors tubulin assembly in vitro
the influence of yb- <dig> on in vitro microtubule assembly was first assessed by turbidimetry. compared to tubulin control, yb- <dig> induced a dramatic shortening of the lag-time in a dose dependant manner. it also dose-dependently increased both the apparent rate of microtubule assembly and the steady state plateau value . we next examined the distribution of yb- <dig> in the soluble tubulin or microtubule fractions in steady-state samples using microtubule sedimentation assay. in agreement with turbidimetry data, the presence of yb- <dig> strongly increased the total amount of tubulin in the pellet . in the presence of  <dig> μm yb- <dig> and  <dig> μm tubulin, most of yb- <dig> was associated with microtubules at steady state. in these conditions, a visual estimation on coomassie stained gels of the yb-1:tubulin stoichiometry indicated a ratio of about  <dig> mole of yb- <dig> per  <dig> moles of tubulin heterodimer in the pellet. when  <dig> μm tubulin was assembled in the presence of  <dig> μm yb- <dig>  we noted a further increase of the amount of tubulin in the pellet. yb- <dig> was again found mainly in the pellet with however a small amount remaining in the supernatant. in these conditions, the yb-1-tubulin stoichiometry in the pellet rose to about  <dig> mole of yb- <dig> per  <dig> moles of tubulin heterodimer. it is worthy to note that yb- <dig> alone, when centrifuged in the same conditions remained totally in the supernatant fraction .

yb- <dig> favors maps-tubulin assembly in vitro
it is well documented that the presence of maps strongly influences the kinetics of microtubule assembly. maps favor the nucleation of microtubules, increase the rate of assembly, extent of polymerization and stabilize microtubules against disassembly. to investigate whether yb- <dig> may also influence tubulin polymerization in conditions close to cellular, we performed a series of experiments with maps-tubulin. this preparation contained approximately 15% of maps  as estimated by coomassie staining of proteins separated on sds-page. the addition of yb- <dig> to maps-tubulin at a total yb-1-tubulin ratio of  <dig>  decreased the lag-time similarly to pure tubulin, increased the rate of polymerization and slightly increased the final microtubule mass as estimated from the steady state plateau value . higher amounts of yb- <dig> further reduced the lag-time of polymerization but did not change significantly the mass of polymerized tubulin. these data indicate that the presence of maps does not abrogate the positive effect of yb- <dig> on the overall kinetics of microtubule assembly.

yb- <dig> accelerates tubulin s assembly in vitro
the c-termini of alpha and beta tubulin subunits are highly negatively charged at physiological ph and involved in the regulation of tubulin function  <cit> . on the other hand, yb- <dig> is highly positively charged at neutral ph, so it was reasonable to think that yb- <dig> accelerates microtubule assembly via interaction with tubulin c-termini. it was therefore critical to investigate whether the effects of yb- <dig> on microtubule assembly could result only from a charge effect or could also be partly due to more specific molecular recognition mechanisms between yb- <dig> and tubulin. for this purpose, we treated tubulin with subtilisin in such conditions as to cleave the charged c-termini of the both tubulin subunits and investigated the effect of yb- <dig> on the assembly of the cleaved tubulin product . we observed that yb- <dig> was still able to promote the assembly of tubulin s . a strong stimulation of assembly was observed when yb- <dig> was added at a total yb-1-tubulin s molar ratio as low as  <dig> . at this ratio, yb- <dig> significantly decreased the lag-time and increased the velocity of the polymerization . higher concentrations of yb- <dig> further reduced the lag-time and increased the rate of tubulin s assembly but did not produce any significant additional effect on microtubule mass at steady-state . together, these data suggest that the promotion of microtubule assembly by yb- <dig> involves interaction between specific sites of the partners, although non-specific electrostatic interactions may also play an important role.

yb- <dig> promotes the formation of normal microtubules and probably coats the microtubule wall
high resolution microscopies like afm or tem could provide interesting information about microtubule morphology in the presence of yb- <dig> and about the localization of yb- <dig> on/in microtubules. under control conditions, i.e., without yb- <dig>  in afm images microtubules appeared as straight rods with an apparent height of  <dig> nm. this indicates that they were flattened on the surface due to the drying procedure  and the height measurement thus corresponded to two tubulin layers in close contact . microtubules formed in the presence of yb- <dig> were significantly higher than the control ones with an average height of about  <dig> nm. the increase in height could correspond to yb- <dig> coating of the microtubule outer wall . however, such morphology can also result from microtubules with double walls or with a higher number of protofilaments.

to distinguish between these scenarios, we investigated the effect of yb- <dig> on the ultrastructure of microtubules by tem with thin sections of epon-embedded microtubules. in control conditions, tem analyses showed regular microtubules with a diameter of about  <dig> nm. with yb- <dig>  the ultrastructure of microtubules remained normal with a single layer of tubulin forming their wall and an outer diameter comparable to control . in addition to this, the number of protofilaments was not significantly different from that of control . this supported further the suggestion that yb- <dig> coats the outer surface of the microtubule. it is also worth noting that, under control conditions, microtubules could often be found in close contact with each other , whereas in the presence of yb- <dig>  microtubules appeared regularly distributed and spaced from each other . due to its coating the microtubule surface, yb- <dig> could induce a change in rigidity of microtubule or steric hindrance on its outer surface, which may lead to a larger inter-microtubule spacing.

tubulin interferes with mrnp formation
yb- <dig> is a major mrna binding protein that forms complexes with mrna and regulates its translational activity. in this context, it is necessary to explore whether tubulin can interfere with formation of rnp and induce some modifications of rnp structure. since rnp differs from naked rna in net charge and molecular weight, we decided to investigate the effect of tubulin on yb-1-rna complexes by electrophoretic mobility gel-shift assay. it is known that rnp saturated with yb- <dig> contains about one molecule of yb- <dig> per  <dig> rna bases  <cit> . compared to rna alone, these saturated yb-1:rna complexes demonstrate a significant reduction of mobility in native agarose gel due to either partial rna discharging or the increased mass of the formed yb-1:rna complex, or both . the presence of tubulin did not change mobility of rna that excluded the possibility of direct interaction between these two molecules . the addition of tubulin to yb-1:rna complexes clearly increased the mobility of rnp . the presence of tubulin may thus induce structural changes of rnp complexes and/or a change in the rnp charge via yb- <dig> withdrawal mediated by tubulin. further investigations are required for a better description of the interaction between mrna:yb- <dig> complexes and tubulin, which may play an important role in transition of mrna from silenced to translationally active state.

discussion
yb- <dig> is a member of the y-box protein family, a family highly conserved among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. in eukaryotes, y-box proteins are regulators of transcription and translation and play important roles during the development and in cell proliferation and transformation. here, we report that yb- <dig> interacts with tubulin and microtubules in vitro and demonstrate that this protein promotes the assembly of microtubules. this new functional link of cellular proteins seems to be important, since, on the one hand, the regulation of many vital processes, such as cell division, motility and intracellular traffic depends on the fine tuning of the intrinsic dynamics of microtubules by protein partners. the inventory of tubulin partners is not complete and the comprehension of their mechanisms of regulation of microtubule dynamics is still under investigation. on the other hand, with yb- <dig> being an rna-binding protein, the study of yb-1:tubulin interaction is highly relevant to further address the competition between tubulin and mrna for yb- <dig> binding. the conformational changes of rnp containing yb- <dig> induced by tubulin may be of particular interest to investigate rnp accessibility for translation and degradation.

yb- <dig> strongly interacts with tubulin
the strong binding between yb- <dig> and tubulin was supported by a series of in vitro biochemical data which also demonstrated that the yb-1:tubulin interaction was independent of the presence of other tissue extract components. since yb- <dig> is positively charged at neutral ph   <cit>  while tubulin is negatively charged   <cit> , we assayed if yb- <dig> interacts with tubulin in a manner similar to that of many other positively charged nucleic acid binding proteins. as tubulin was still retained on a yb- <dig> column at physiological ionic strength, we concluded that the attraction between tubulin and yb- <dig> was the result of a strong, short-ranged, electrostatic interactions and  other more specific mechanisms like hydrophobic interactions. additionally, we found that yb- <dig> did not provoke the formation of huge aggregates containing tubulin, in contrast to other highly cationic proteins like histones  <cit> . the yb-1-tubulin oligomeric complexes formed in "non-assembly conditions" had their heights about  <dig> nm , which indicated the involvement of a few yb- <dig> and tubulin molecules in formation of these complexes.

microtubule polymerization is a two-step process in which tubulin first forms nucleation templates and then adds to and elongates them  <cit> . the templates were modelled either in equilibrium with tubulin dimers  <cit>  or as persistent structures  <cit> . maps facilitate the formation of templates and are thought to clamp them. the yb-1-tubulin complexes we observed here were functionally reminiscent of maps-tubulin complexes  <cit> . the yb-1-tubulin complexes could represent nucleation templates, and thus, yb- <dig> could act as a nucleation factor for microtubule assembly in vitro in a manner similar to that of classical maps  <cit> .

yb- <dig> favours microtubule assembly and coats the microtubule wall
yb- <dig> strongly favoured polymerization of pure tubulin into microtubules. yb- <dig> was found to accelerate the apparent rate of microtubule assembly, to increase the microtubule mass at steady state and to be associated with microtubules.

the ability of maps or other non-specific basic molecules to promote microtubule assembly depends largely upon the presence of the negative charges of tubulin c-termini  <cit> . in contrast to these positively charged molecules, we found that yb- <dig>  which is also a basic protein, still stimulated polymerization of tubulin cleaved by subtilisin. this observation suggests that the promotion of microtubule assembly by yb- <dig> results not only from purely electrostatic interactions but also from a more specific molecular recognition mechanism. this suggestion is supported by the fact that most positively charged molecules which interact in a non-specific manner with tubulin promote the assembly of tubulin into aberrant structures instead of microtubules. for example, polycations induce the formation of double-walled microtubules  <cit> , and aminoacyl-trna synthetases promote microtubule bundling  <cit> . in the present work, electron microscopy analysis showed that microtubules formed in the presence of yb- <dig> possess a normal morphology with a single wall of circa  <dig> nm diameter and parallel afm investigations showed that yb- <dig> can coat the outer surface of the microtubule wall.

in agreement with these microscopic data, yb- <dig> was found to co-sediment with microtubules . the stoichiometry corresponds well to some other microtubule-binding proteins with single tubulin dimer-binding site  <cit> . many canonic maps were reported to bind microtubules with a stoichiometry ranging from 1: <dig> to 1: <dig>  probably because of multiple tubulin-binding sites and high molecular mass of these proteins  <cit> .

yb- <dig> promotes polymerization of maps-tubulin
in the presence of maps-tubulin, yb- <dig> also accelerated microtubule assembly, although it didn't promote an increase of the total mass of polymerized tubulin. this was most probably due to the fact that our maps-tubulin preparation contained around 15% of maps , which makes microtubules nearly saturated with maps. interestingly, some high molecular weight maps were partially displaced by yb- <dig> from maps-microtubules stabilized with taxol when the total yb-1-tubulin molar ratio was above  <dig>  . as mentioned above, classical maps, such as tau and map <dig>  interact mostly with the negatively charged c-termini of tubulin. in addition, tau binds to the amino terminal region of alpha tubulin subunit  <cit> . since yb- <dig> strongly promoted assembly of tubulin lacking c-termini, we predict that yb- <dig> interacts with microtubules not only via non-specific binding to the negatively charged c-terminal tail. finally, in this context, it is interesting to note that yb- <dig> doesn't display any homology with classical maps and may represent the generic element of a novel class of microtubule interacting proteins.

yb- <dig> may shuttle between mrna and the microtubule cytoskeleton in vivo
microtubules play a critical role in mrna translation and localization in vivo . numerous plant proteins known to regulate translation were recently identified by affinity chromatography as tubulin-binding proteins  <cit> . for example, the plant initiation factor eif-4f was found associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton in the cell and is able to induces microtubule bundling in vitro  <cit> .

since yb- <dig> is a major component of cellular rnps, interaction of tubulin with yb- <dig> could potentially regulate the translation state of mrnas. indeed, yb- <dig> protects mrnas from degradation and packs them in non-translatable rnps. we have shown here that tubulin changes the electrophoretic mobility of yb-1-rna complexes. this change most probably occurs due to the partial dissociation of yb- <dig> from rna, which could be a signal to trigger mrna translation and/or degradation. interestingly, it has recently been shown that the phosphorylation of yb- <dig> by akt kinase may regulate its binding to mrna  <cit> . it is thus expected that the phosphorylated form of yb- <dig>  which possesses a lower affinity for the cap-structure of mrna, could be more easily released from rna than its non-phosphorylated form. this release could occur due to interaction of mrna with other rna-binding proteins or through the interaction of yb- <dig> with protein partners, such as tubulin. our results thus provide new prospects on the role of protein-protein interaction in the regulation of mrna translation. furthermore, these results could also help to unravel situations where tubulin is involved in the overall processes of mrna translation and degradation.

CONCLUSIONS
thus, we have first demonstrated that yb- <dig> stimulates microtubule assembly in vitro. by all in vitro criteria, yb- <dig> represents a novel microtubule-interacting protein related to the function of maps but clearly with different properties. the yb- <dig> properties described here may contribute to the understanding of its role in the cell division and embryogenesis and shed light on its oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities  <cit> . finally, these results could provide a framework to bridge different aspects of regulation of mrna translation and the function of the microtubule cytoskeleton.
