BACKGROUND
the breakpoint cluster region  protein was originally identified as the amino-terminal part of a fusion protein including the abl tyrosine kinase, which causes chronic myeloid leukemia and ph-chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. the fusion of bcr to abl deregulates the tyrosine kinase activity of abl  <cit> . although the bcr protein contributes a varying number of domains to the fusion protein, the n-terminal oligomerization domain of bcr is considered to be the most critical component that allows the formation of homo-tetramer bcr/abl complexes and deregulates the abl tyrosine kinase  <cit> .

the normal  bcr gene encodes a multidomain protein. apart from the oligomerization domain, it additionally contains serine/threonine protein kinase, tandem dh-ph, c <dig> and gtpase activating protein  domains. the latter domain has a relatively well-described function: it down-regulates the activated gtp-bound conformation of the small g-protein rac in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . this function is shared by abr, a related protein that also contains tandem dh-ph, c <dig> and gap domains. however, abr lacks the n-terminal oligomerization domain.

to understand how the gap activity of bcr is regulated, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with full-length bcr and isolated transglutaminase  <dig> , an interesting multi-functional and multi-domain member of the transglutaminase family  <cit> . unlike other transglutaminases, it is expressed in a variety of tissues and cells and also undergoes a gtp-binding/gtpase cycle. tg <dig> is located in the cytosol, in the nucleus, and on the surface of cells  <cit> . it appears to have multiple functions, including roles in differentiation, apoptosis, signal transduction, adhesion and migration, wound healing, inflammation and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells  <cit> . tg <dig> can adopt a closed conformation when its c-terminal domain is gtp-bound. we found that this conformation has decreased affinity for binding with bcr. however, in the absence g-nucleotides, tg <dig> binds to bcr and is able to inhibit the bcr gap activity towards rac  <cit> .

transglutaminases exhibit several enzymatic activities. these include transamidation reactions  as well as esterification, deamidation and isopeptidase activities  <cit> . tg <dig> is activated in the presence of high concentrations of calcium and converts to an open conformation. however, tg <dig> transglutaminase activity is latent under normal conditions because the steady-state concentration of calcium in the cytoplasm is low. it only becomes activated under pathogenic conditions and/or extreme cellular stress  <cit> .

because bcr and tg <dig> can form a direct protein complex, we considered the possibility that bcr could also act as a substrate for tg <dig>  we here show that bcr but not the related abr protein is a substrate of tg <dig> in vitro and in cells under conditions of cellular stress. interestingly, the presence of the n-terminal oligomerization domain in bcr was responsible for this differential modification, which may lead to its degradation under conditions of extreme stress.

RESULTS
tg <dig> cross-links bcr
tg <dig> can adopt alternate conformations depending on the presence of g-nucleotides or calcium. we previously showed that tg <dig> interacts with bcr when tg <dig> is in the open, non-g-nucleotide bound conformation, which is also the conformation adopted in the presence of calcium  <cit> . therefore, we investigated whether ca2+ could affect the interaction between tg <dig> and bcr.

as shown in figure 1a, we pre-incubated tg <dig> with ca2+ or with gtpγs, then added gst-bcrgap, and performed a gst pull-down assay to investigate the binding of bcr and tg <dig> by immunoblotting with antibodies to tg <dig>  gtpγs loading of both guinea pig tg <dig> as well as recombinant his-tagged tg <dig> reduced its binding to bcrgap , in agreement with our previous results  <cit> .

the presence of calcium is known to activate tg <dig> and cause auto-crosslinking  <cit> . interestingly, in the presence of ca2+ there was increased binding of the tg <dig> monomer to bcrgap and, moreover, the tg <dig> multimer also was pulled down with bcrgap .

since the transamidase activity of tg <dig> is ca2+-dependent, we next assessed whether bcr is a substrate of tg <dig>  we transfected cos- <dig> cells with bcr, added guinea pig liver tg <dig> to cell lysates, and performed a transglutaminase assay in the presence or absence of ca2+. as shown in figure 1b, addition of exogenous tg <dig> produced high molecular weight bcr aggregates in a dose- and calcium-dependent manner. also, we observed high molecular weight aggregates of endogenous bcr in hela cell lysates in the presence of guinea pig tg <dig> . to investigate if this cross-linked bcr results from the transglutaminase activity of tg <dig>  tg <dig> wild type or c277s  and bcr were co-transfected into cos- <dig> cells, after which a transamidase assay was performed. as shown in figure 1d, the tg <dig> c277s mutant did not induce aggregate formation of bcr, whereas expression of the wild type tg <dig> increased the levels of cross-linked bcr. to confirm that the cross-linking activity is ca2+-dependent, cell lysates were also pretreated with egta, a chelator of ca2+. figure 1e shows that the cross-linking reaction was blocked by  <dig> mm egta. these results indicate that bcr aggregate formation requires transglutaminase activity of tg <dig> and ca2+. since bcr naturally forms homo-tetramers, these high molecular weight complexes will consist of bcr monomers but could also contain tg <dig>  since it was recovered in a pull-down reaction with the bcr gap domain , as well as other unidentified proteins.

bcr oligomerization domain is required for cross-linking by tg2
bcr is a large protein containing several domains . abr  also functions as a gap for rac and is the only protein that shares a high degree of homology with bcr  <cit> . the main difference between the two proteins is, that abr lacks a domain that has homology to the n-terminal end of bcr. this region in bcr includes a serine/threonine kinase domain of unknown significance and a coiled-coil domain that allows bcr to form tetramers. we previously showed that the abr gap domain can bind to tg <dig>  <cit> . however, as shown in figure 2b, abr was not detectably cross-linked by tg <dig> 

we therefore asked if the n-terminal coiled-coil domain of bcr could be responsible for allowing tg <dig> to cross-link bcr. a construct that lacked the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids was co-expressed with tg <dig> and compared to the wild type bcr protein. as shown in figure 2b, whereas xpress-tagged bcr wild type was cross-linked, the protein lacking the coiled-coil region clearly was not. we confirmed this result by increasing the reaction time or concentration of ca2+: no cross-linking of the bcrΔoligo protein was detected at any length of incubation or concentration of calcium. in contrast, increased concentrations of calcium and prolonged reaction times resulted in progressively increased bcr appearing in high molecular weight complexes. after  <dig> hours with  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  very little monomeric bcr remained . these results indicate that the oligomerization domain of bcr is cross-linked by tg <dig> 

bcr is cross-linked in cells under extreme stress
in the experiments described above, calcium was added to protein lysates. the transglutaminase activity of tg <dig> can also be activated in the presence of increased levels of intracellular ca2+. to examine tg2-induced aggregation of bcr in cells, cos- <dig> cells were transfected with bcr alone or together with tg <dig> and treated with ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, which induces cell death at high concentrations  <cit> . as shown in figure 3a, co-expression of tg <dig> with bcr caused a significant increase of high molecular weight bcr complexes in cells. ionomycin treatment also caused bcr cross-linking in cells transfected only with bcr, likely through activation of endogenous tg <dig> .

to examine cross-linking of endogenous bcr, we selected primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells , since this cell type expresses substantial amounts of tg <dig>  <cit> . in addition, tg <dig> plays a role in endothelial cell adhesion, proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . as shown in figure 3b, these cells clearly expressed bcr protein, and bcr co-localized with endogenous tg <dig> in the cytosol. exposure of hpaec to a <dig>  a different calcium ionophore, induced bcr cross-linking, as was evident by the appearance of high molecular weight bcr complexes, and this was accompanied by a reduction in the amount of monomers . these complexes were detected as a smear of bcr-immunoreactive material at the top of the separation gel and even in the wells of the stacking gel, in an a <dig> dose-dependent manner.

cocl <dig> is a hypoxia-mimetic agent, because like hypoxia, it can decrease the degradation and cause subsequent accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor -1α, a critical regulator of the cellular response to hypoxia  <cit> . also, cocl <dig> induces cell death  <cit> . it was also recently reported that hypoxia induces the expression of tg <dig> via hif-1α in some cancer cell types, but not in others  <cit> . to investigate the effect of this type of extreme stress on bcr cross-linking by tg <dig>  we exposed hpaecs to increasing concentrations of this heavy metal. as shown in figure 3d, the treatment with high concentrations of cocl <dig> caused the appearance high molecular weight bcr aggregates, suggesting that hypoxic stress can also cause covalent adducts on bcr. cocl <dig> treatment had no effect on the level of tg <dig> expression in hpaecs .

treatment with a <dig> or cocl <dig> visibly stressed the cells, which showed signs of apoptosis as determined by facs . consistent with this, dapi staining showed nuclear condensation and fragmentation . interestingly, endogenous bcr showed a prominent punctuate staining, especially in a <dig> treated cells . this is consistent with cocl <dig> or a <dig> causing accumulation of bcr aggregates in hpaecs that are undergoing cell death.

cross-linked bcr is removed by proteasomal degradation
as shown in figure 4a, pretreatment with a competitive tg <dig> inhibitor, cystamine, dramatically suppressed the appearance of bcr high molecular weight aggregates, further confirming that the formation of these complexes is dependent on tg <dig> activity. since the solubility of some proteins changes after modification by tg <dig>  including monomeric forms and aggregates  <cit> , we separated cell lysates into tritonx- <dig> soluble and insoluble fractions. as shown in figure 4b, the high molecular weight bcr aggregates were mainly present in the tritonx-100-insoluble fraction, and more bcr monomers were present in the tritonx-100-soluble fraction.

it has been shown that tg <dig> promotes the proteasomal degradation of some proteins including nucleophosmin and pten  <cit> . to investigate if the high molecular weight bcr aggregates are degraded in a proteasome-dependent pathway, hpaecs were pretreated with mg <dig>  a proteasomal inhibitor, before exposure to the calcium ionophore. interestingly, pretreatment with mg <dig> caused accumulation of the high molecular weight aggregates of bcr . these results suggest that bcr aggregates, resulting from cross-linking by tg <dig>  are ultimately disposed of by proteasomal degradation.

discussion
binding of guanine nucleotides or of ca2+ to tg <dig> is known to inversely regulate its conformation and its transglutaminase activity: whereas ca2+-bound tg <dig> has an open conformation and is active as a transglutaminase, tg <dig> bound to g-nucleotides is enzymatically inactive, with a closed conformation  <cit> . although bcr binds preferentially to the open conformation of tg <dig>  the interaction is not dependent upon tg <dig> being active as a transglutaminase because the interaction also occurred with the catalytically inactive tg <dig> c277s mutant  <cit> . our current results demonstrate that bcr also binds quite strongly to the activated, calcium-bound form of tg <dig>  together, these results suggest that under normal physiological conditions, tg <dig> interacts with bcr even though the calcium concentration is not sufficient for activation of the transglutaminase activity. under conditions of cellular stress caused by high calcium influx, the calcium-bound, enzymatically active form of tg <dig> then uses bcr as a substrate for cross-linking.

apart from high calcium concentrations, other cellular stressors that have been reported to involve tg <dig> activation include exposure to bacterial endotoxin and glutamate-mediated excitotoxic damage of neuronal cells  <cit> . however, we did not detect bcr aggregates in primary rat neurons exposed to glutamate or bone marrow-derived macrophages treated with lps . also, bcr aggregates were only detected in hpaecs stressed by cocl <dig> or a <dig> treatment and not by other stimulants including lps, tnf-α, and thrombin . therefore the formation of bcr aggregates may be specific only for certain types of cell stress that lead to cell death.

to the best of our knowledge, the biological effect of tg <dig> cross-linking due to calcium overload has not been conclusively defined for any protein. however, based on what is known about bcr structure and function, we can envision three possible consequences of bcr cross-linking under conditions of calcium influx and apoptosis. one is a role that was postulated in general for the consequences of tg <dig> cross-linking activity under conditions of cell death: tg <dig> activity could produce a protein-rich "shell" that would prevent leakage of cellular components to the extracellular space and, through this, reduce inflammation that would otherwise be provoked by cell debris  <cit> . bcr contains a c <dig> domain that, in other proteins, is a calcium-binding module. the adjacent ph domain was recently shown to be able to bind to keratin  <dig>  β-tubulin and collagen iv  <cit> . because the high molecular weight bcr aggregates found in our study were mainly present in the tritonx-100-insoluble fraction, one could speculate that bcr, due to multiple cellular interactions including its own capacity to form homo-tetramers, acts as a calcium-induced scaffold for the formation of high molecular weight aggregates including elements of the cytoskeleton. this function would be consistent with the overall activity of bcr to negatively regulate inflammation in vivo  <cit> .

a second speculative role is in the area of vesicle transport. the ph domain of bcr was shown to bind to specific mono-phospholipids ptdinsp and ptdinsp that are present in early endosomal membranes and in the golgi, respectively  <cit> . moreover, bcr binds to the endosomal sorting protein tsg <dig>  <cit> , which is also present in exosomes  <cit> . since cross-linking of bcr could affect its gap activity on rac, this in turn could potentially affect the trafficking of extracellular tg <dig>  finally, our results suggest that cross-linked bcr is targeted for degradation. since bcr is a negative regulator of rac, its removal would lead to increased levels of activated rac, which has been associated with both decreased and increased apoptosis, depending on the cell type.

bcr contains a unique n-terminal coiled-coil domain that has been a focus of significant interest because it is responsible for deregulation of the tyrosine kinase activity of abl within the bcr/abl fusion protein that causes the development of some types of leukemia. interestingly, this domain also allows the formation of bcr homodimers and tetramers  <cit> . we here found that it plays an important role in the formation of bcr aggregates. the domain encompasses residues 2- <dig>  which includes two lysine and five glutamine residues that could be involved in the cross-linking reaction, but the exact requirements for cross-linking remain to be determined. it will also be of interest to address if tg <dig> is able to cross-link the n-terminal oligomerization domain of the bcr/abl oncoprotein.

CONCLUSIONS
we recently showed that tg <dig> directly interacts with bcr and regulates the gap activity of bcr under normal physiological conditions. here, we present data showing that bcr is a substrate for tg <dig> transglutaminase activity in vitro and in cells. under extreme stress, tg <dig> cross-links bcr into high molecular weight complexes which are removed by a proteasomal degradation pathway. these results suggest that bcr is regulated by tg <dig> via different mechanisms, depending on the physiological conditions in the cell.
