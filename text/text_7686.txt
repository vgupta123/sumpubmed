BACKGROUND
there is no clear consensus regarding the use of blood-based gene expression data for addressing neurological and neuroscientific research questions. on the one hand, gene expression levels in whole blood are only weakly correlated with those in brain tissue  <cit> . on the other hand, blood gene expression profiles have been used to study neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  <cit> , as well as neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <cit> , huntington's disease  <cit> , alzheimer's disease  <cit> , and chronic fatigue syndrome  <cit> . there are at least two major reasons why the relationship between human brain and human blood expression profiles remains poorly understood. the first reason concerns data quality and quantity: it is notoriously difficult to measure human brain tissue expression levels because of potential biases from post-mortem effects and relatively low sample sizes. the second reason is that most previous studies have focused on the preservation of mean expression levels, as opposed to the preservation of co-expression relationships. given that the human brain transcriptome is organized into biologically meaningful co-expression modules  <cit> , it is important to study the preservation of this organization in blood.

because human brain expression data is derived from post-mortem brain tissue, special attention must be paid to rna quality, post-mortem interval, and ph. to minimize the influence of these factors, we used highly reproducible and validated brain gene expression data sets from a recent meta-analysis of publicly available brain expression data  <cit> . data set  <dig>  consisted of  <dig> control samples from  <dig> individuals representing four cortical areas  <cit> . data set  <dig>  consisted of  <dig> control samples from  <dig> individuals taken from the head of the caudate nucleus  <cit> . data set  <dig>  consisted of  <dig> control samples from  <dig> individuals taken from cerebellar hemisphere  <cit> .

by applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit>  to these data sets, oldham et al.  identified  <dig> cortex  modules,  <dig> caudate nucleus  modules, and  <dig> cerebellum  modules. these modules were defined as branches of a hierarchical clustering tree and were labeled by different colors. many modules were highly preserved across the three brain regions, which was why they received the same color label. for example, 45%  of genes overlapped between the yellow cortex module  and yellow caudate nucleus module . similarly, 46%  of genes overlapped between the blue/ctx and the blue/cn modules  <cit> . by considering cell type-specific markers, several brain modules were found to contain genes that are preferentially expressed in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes or neurons  <cit> .

here we report the results of a comprehensive statistical analysis by cross-referencing the brain expression data with two large blood data sets . while previous studies have focused on the preservation of individual gene expression levels across the two tissues, we also investigated the preservation of gene co-expression modules. since oligodenrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons are not present in blood, we were not surprised that only a handful of human brain modules showed evidence of preservation in human blood. furthermore, we determined that these preserved modules could be combined into a single large module in blood. we also found that preserved intramodular hub genes tended to have heritable blood expression levels and were highly correlated with a small set of cluster of differentiation  genes.

RESULTS
blood gene expression data
we used whole blood gene expression data from healthy controls in a dutch data set  and published lymphocyte gene expression data , herein referred to as the san antonio family heart study  data set  <cit> . the dutch data set originally consisted of  <dig> peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals . this data set was analyzed with illumina human ht- <dig> microarrays. the safhs data set originally consisted of  <dig> lymphocytes samples obtained from  <dig> individuals . this data set was analyzed with illumina wg- <dig> microarrays. using hierarchical clustering with inter-array correlations as a distance measure, we identified potential outlying arrays in an unbiased fashion. since outlying arrays showed relatively low correlations with the other arrays , they were deemed suspicious. to err on the side of caution, we removed these suspicious arrays from the analysis. potential batch effects  were also removed using combat  <cit> . these are the same data pre-processing steps that oldham et al.  used in the brain data analysis. more sample pre-processing information can be found in additional file  <dig> 

after these pre-processing steps,  <dig> samples remained in the dutch data set and  <dig> samples remained in the safhs data set. multiple probes corresponding to one gene  were combined into one measurement. next, we merged the affymetrix  data with the illumina  data by gene symbol, which resulted in  <dig> genes in each data set.

preservation of mean expression levels and connectivity
we first studied the preservation of mean gene expression levels of the  <dig> genes between brain and blood. the pairwise scatterplots in additional file  <dig> related mean expression values in the three brain regions to mean expression values in the two blood data sets. we found significant but weak correlations  between mean expression in brain and mean expression in blood.

next we investigated the extent to which co-expression patterns were preserved between brain and blood. for each gene, the network connectivity  is defined as the sum of its connection strengths with all other genes in the network. thus, connectivity measures how correlated a gene is with all other genes . genes with high connectivity are informally referred to as "hub" genes. overall, we found that gene connectivity was even less preserved  in blood than mean expression levels. these results show that global co-expression relationships are poorly preserved between brain and blood. however, additional file  <dig> also shows some genes with high connectivity in both data sets. these genes may be part of sets of genes  that are preserved between the two tissues. a more focused analysis that considered individual modules did reveal some evidence of preservation between the two tissues, as described below.

preservation of brain co-expression modules in blood
oldham et al.  applied rigorous gene filters to the brain data set to ensure that transcripts were present and had high connectivity in the brain data . these filters reduced the number of probe sets in each network to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . after combining probes into single measures for each gene symbol and merging the data with the blood data sets, the ctx network contained  <dig> genes, cn network contained  <dig> genes and the cb network contained  <dig> genes.

to determine whether a module found in a reference data set  can also be found in a test data set , we used a powerful module preservation statistic approach implemented in the r software function modulepreservation  <cit>  . this permutation test procedure evaluates whether module genes show significant evidence of network connectivity preservation in the test data. this module preservation test results in a statistic  for each module. the higher the preservation z statistic is for a given brain module, the stronger the evidence that the brain module is preserved in a given blood data set. under the null hypothesis of no module preservation, the preservation z statistic follows an approximately standard normal distribution. comprehensive simulation studies led to the following thresholds: a module shows no evidence of preservation if its z statistic is smaller than 2; a z statistic larger than  <dig>  indicates moderate  module preservation.

we started out by evaluating the preservation of ctx modules in the dutch and safhs blood data sets. the horizontal barplots in figure 1a show that the preservation z statistics of the blue, yellow, and green ctx modules were above the threshold of  <dig> in both blood data sets, i.e. these modules showed strong evidence of preservation. similarly, figure 1b presents the module preservation results for the cn modules identified by oldham et al. . only the yellow cn module was strongly preserved in both blood data sets. figure 1c shows that only the blue cb module was strongly preserved in both blood data sets. in total, we find that five brain modules were strongly preserved in human blood. more details and numeric values are presented in additional file  <dig> 

the preserved modules tended to be relatively large: out of  <dig> ctx network genes ,  <dig> were part of the blue module,  <dig> were part of the green module and  <dig> were part of the yellow module. the preserved  cn module contained  <dig> genes out of  <dig> cn network genes. the preserved cb  module contained  <dig> out of  <dig> cb network genes. thus, 67% of genes in the cortex network, 12% of genes in the caudate nucleus network, and 41% of genes in the cerebellum network were part of a preserved module.

one can also visualize the evidence of module preservation by clustering the genes in the blood data sets. since the brain modules were defined as branches of a hierarchical clustering tree , we used the identical approach to define modules in the blood gene expression data. additional file  <dig> shows dendrograms of the blood gene expression data. as described in the methods section, blood modules were defined as branches of the dendrogram  <cit> . the first color-band underneath each dendrogram encodes blood module colors. the remaining color bands indicate module membership in brain modules. visual inspection of these dendrograms revealed that genes from the preserved modules  tended to cluster together in the blood data. the fact that some colors were not contiguous shows that the preservation is not perfect. below, we define measures of module membership to identify the subsets of genes inside each of the five preserved modules that showed the strongest evidence of preservation.

relationships among preserved modules in blood
while the brain modules were clearly distinct in the brain data sets, their preserved counterparts no longer appeared distinct in the blood data sets. to explore the relationships among preserved modules in blood, we summarized module expression profiles by forming the first principal component, which is referred to as the module eigengene   <cit> . for example, me denotes the module eigengene of the blue cortex module. the me can be considered a weighted average of the gene expression profiles in a module. if the me of one module is highly correlated with that of another module in the blood data, then the genes inside the two modules have similar blood expression patterns, i.e. the two modules cannot be distinguished.

for the dutch data set and the safhs data set, figure  <dig> shows that me, me, me, and me had highly significant positive correlations  with each other, but highly significant negative correlations  with me. this result indicates that the five preserved brain modules can hardly be distinguished in an unsigned gene co-expression network in blood, as they coalesce into one large preserved module. it is natural to ask whether these five modules were distinct in the original brain data sets. additional file  <dig> shows that the three preserved ctx modules  were only moderately correlated in the ctx data: the correlation between me and me was  <dig> ; the correlation between me and me was - <dig> ; the correlation between me and me was - <dig> . the brain data did not allow us to correlate mes of different brain regions, since the data consisted of samples from different individuals.

preservation of module membership between brain and blood
we defined a measure of module membership  by correlating the me with each gene expression profile  <cit> . for example, mmbluei = cor measures how correlated the expression profile of the i-th gene is with the blue me. if mmbluei is close to  <dig>  the i-th gene is not part of the blue module. but if mmbluei is close to  <dig> , it is highly positively  correlated with the blue module genes. the module membership measure is highly related to intramodular connectivity  <cit> ; thus, a gene with high absolute value mmbluei turns out to be a highly connected hub gene inside the blue module.

for each of the five preserved modules, we defined module membership measures in the respective brain data set and the two blood data sets . figure  <dig> shows that mm measures were highly correlated between the two blood data sets, indicating that the mm measure can be robustly defined in blood.

the extremely significant correlation test p-values in the scatterplots reflect the large sample size, i.e. numbers of genes. it may be more meaningful to consider the correlation coefficient value, e.g. a correlation value of  <dig>  indicates a strong  linear relationship. we combined the mm measures for the dutch and safhs data to arrive at a summary measure for human blood, which was referred to as "blood mm measure". additional file  <dig> reports the correlations between the summary blood mm measure and the two individual blood mm measures.

although the three modules were distinct in the cortex data, their mm measures also showed high correlations in cortex , which allowed us to define a combined mm measure for the ctx data. the combined cortex mm measure was significantly correlated  with the combined blood mm measure. at the same time, the cn mm measure and the cb mm measure also showed significant correlations with the blood mm measure . these results support the original finding that the five co-expression modules  exhibit significant preservation in blood.

definition of preserved intramodular hub genes
we refer to genes with high module membership in a preserved module as a preserved intramodular hub gene. preserved hub genes show highly significant evidence of being centrally located inside a preserved module. specifically, we defined preserved ctx module hub genes as having consistently high positive or negative combined mm in both cortex and blood. toward this end, we thresholded the combined mm measures in both blood and cortex at a value of + <dig>  and - <dig>  . these thresholds resulted in  <dig> preserved ctx hub genes, which are colored in red in figure 5a. for the preserved yellow cn module and preserved blue cb module, we found  <dig> preserved cn hub genes  and  <dig> preserved cb hub genes  using the same threshold.

in summary, only  <dig> genes  from the ctx network,  <dig> genes  from the cn network and  <dig> genes  from the cb network are preserved intramodular hub genes. these preserved intramodular hub genes exhibited the following overlap: the sets of preserved ctx  genes and preserved cn  genes shared  <dig> genes . the sets of preserved ctx  genes and preserved cb  genes shared  <dig> genes . the sets of preserved cn  genes and preserved cb  genes shared  <dig> genes . all three sets of preserved intramodular hub genes shared  <dig> genes. the names of these preserved hub genes and their mm values can be found in additional file  <dig>  the biological role of the  <dig> genes is discussed below.

the union of the three sets of preserved intramodular hub genes contains  <dig> genes. a functional enrichment analysis of the  <dig> genes reveals that some of these preserved hub genes play a role in infectious disease and infection mechanism , post-translational modification , and rna post-transcriptional modification  . a more detailed functional enrichment analysis for each set of preserved ctx, cn, and cb module genes can be found in additional file  <dig> 

preserved intramodular hub genes have more heritable expression levels
in the original publication of the safhs data, the authors calculated the heritability of each gene expression level and created a heritability table  <cit> . the gene expression heritability measures the proportion of expression trait variance attributable to genetic variance. these data allowed us to test whether preserved intramodular hub genes have more highly heritable expression levels than non-preserved intramodular hub genes. the red, yellow and blue bars in figure 5d-f show the mean heritability  for the preserved ctx, cn and cb hub genes, respectively. to facilitate a comparison, we also report the mean heritability for all genes in heritability table  and for all genes in the merged blood and brain data set .

relationships between preserved modules and cluster of differentiation genes
we also investigated the relationships between the preserved modules and a special class of cell surface markers: cluster of differentiation  genes, which are routinely used to characterize blood cell types. if a module is enriched with cell type-specific genes, then its module eigengene should have a strong correlation with the expression values of cd genes that are specific to that cell type. a high positive correlation would therefore suggest that a particular cell type might be related to the module. we found that the mes of the five preserved modules had highly significant  positive correlations with the following cd genes: cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  statistical details for the individual modules are presented in additional file  <dig> 

in the following, we briefly describe what is known about the products of these cd genes while additional file  <dig> presents more detailed gene information .

cd <dig>  is known to be a ligand of the t lymphocyte cd <dig> protein, and functions in adhesion and activation of t lymphocytes.

cd <dig>  is a membrane protein, which is involved in the increase in intracellular calcium concentration that occurs upon cell adhesion to extracellular matrix.

cd <dig>  is an activation-associated cell surface glycoprotein, and involved in facilitating interaction between activated lymphocytes.

cd <dig>  is cell surface glycoprotein and involved in the regulation of cell development, activation, growth and motility.

cd <dig>  is a type i integral transmembrane sialomucin that functions as an adhesion receptor. it is involved in hematopoiesis, migration of umbilical cord blood, prostate cancer metastasis, infiltration of bone marrow, myogenesis and myoblast migration.

module preservation between different brain regions
as mentioned in the introduction, many brain modules were found to be highly preserved across the three brain regions, which is why they received the same color label. here we use a more powerful approach for measuring module preservation  than the one used in the original analysis by oldham et al. therefore, we use the modulepreservation function to re-analyze brain module preservation across brain regions. for example, we evaluate which ctx brain modules are preserved in the cn and cb data. detailed results of this analysis can be found in additional file  <dig>  for ctx brain modules, we find that  <dig> out of  <dig> ctx module show at least moderate evidence of preservation  in both cn and cb data. for cn brain modules, we find that  <dig> out of  <dig> cn modules also show at least moderate evidence of preservation  in both ctx and cb data. for cb brain modules, we find that  <dig> out of  <dig> cb modules show at least moderate evidence of preservation  in both ctx and cn data. in summary, 55% modules showed preservation cross the different brain regions. these results are congruent with those presented in the original analysis by oldham et al. it is particularly interesting to study which of our  <dig> preserved blood/brain modules are preserved in other brain regions.

for the  <dig> preserved ctx/blood modules , we find that all  <dig> of them showed very high evidence of preservation in both cn  and cb data .

for the preserved  cn/blood module, we find very high evidence of preservation in ctx data , but only moderate/weak evidence preservation in cb data .

for the preserved  cb/blood module, we find very high evidence of preservation in both cn  and cb data . further, details can be found in additional file  <dig> 

overall, we find strong evidence that the preserved brain/blood modules are also preserved in multiple brain regions.

discussion
few studies are able to access human neural tissue for studying diseases  <cit> . given the difficulty of procuring human brain tissue versus the relative ease of measuring blood expression levels, a question of great practical importance is to determine to what extent blood is a reasonable surrogate for brain in gene expression studies. here we relate highly reproducible brain expression data from a recent meta-analysis of human brain data sets to two large blood data sets. overall, we find that mean expression levels are weakly preserved between three brain regions and blood . since gene expression profiles in human brain regions are organized into highly reproducible co-expression modules  <cit> , it is important to determine which of these modules show evidence of preservation in blood. only three out of  <dig> cortex modules, one out of  <dig> caudate nucleus modules and one out of  <dig> cerebellum modules show strong evidence of preservation. in blood, these five modules exhibit very similar expression patterns as can be seen from the very high absolute correlations  between their respective eigengenes .

although few modules were preserved, they tended to be relatively large. 67% of genes in the cortex network were part of one of the three preserved modules; 41% of genes in the cerebellum network and 12% of the caudate nucleus network genes were part of their respective preserved modules. intramodular hub genes inside preserved modules are centrally located in both modules. the number of intramodular hubs depends on the threshold used for the module membership measures in brain and blood.  <dig> %  of genes in the cortex network,  <dig> %  of genes in the caudate nucleus network, and  <dig> %  of genes in the cerebellum network were defined as preserved intramodular hub genes. using our posted data and r software code, the reader can change the thresholds used for defining these hub genes. our biological characterization of preserved intramodular hub genes is highly robust with respect to the chosen threshold values.

in mice, mean expression levels of heritable genes have been found to be highly correlated between mouse hippocampus and spleen  <cit> . we do not find that heritable genes exhibit highly correlated mean expression levels between brain and blood . however, we find that the preserved intramodular hub genes tend to be more heritable .

the preserved ctx blue, green, and yellow modules were found to be enriched with neuronal markers, glutamatergic synapse genes, and metabolism-related genes, respectively. the preserved cn yellow module was also found to be enriched with metabolism-related genes, while the preserved cb blue module was enriched with neuronal markers and genes encoding synaptic proteins  <cit> . in blood, studying the enrichment with regard to brain cell type markers is not meaningful. however, one can classify blood cell types using human clusters of differentiation  genes. interestingly, the following cd molecules consistently have significant positive correlation with genes inside the preserved modules: cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> 

a functional enrichment analysis of brain module preservation reveals basic functional pathways preserved between the two tissues. figure  <dig> shows that these preserved intramodular hub genes are significantly enriched for genes that play a role in infectious disease and infection mechanism, post-translational modification and rna post-transcriptional modification. other categories include cell death, energy production, nucleic acid metabolism, molecular transport and protein trafficking . the  <dig> intramodular hub genes that were preserved in all three sets exhibit several common functional themes. first, nearly 20% of these genes, including asf1a, atf <dig>  dr <dig>  hcfc1r <dig>  hmgn <dig>  mbd <dig>  and rad <dig>  are known to play roles in modifying chromatin structure. some of these modifications have been shown to induce transcription , while others produce repressive effects . a number of other genes in the group of  <dig> encode signalling proteins that are thought to play roles in a wide variety of cellular processes, including arpp- <dig>  csnk1g <dig>  map4k <dig>  ppp1cb, and ywhaq. a third category of genes relates to protein trafficking and includes rab1a, snx <dig>  snx <dig>  while a fourth category consists of genes involved in mitochondrial function, including dlat, sucla <dig>  and yme1l <dig>  some of the proteins encoded by these  <dig> genes may physically interact, such as atp6ap <dig>  which associates with the transmembrane sector of vacuolar atpases , and atp6v1c <dig>  which is a subunit of the vacuolar atpase protein complex. intriguingly, for a number of other genes in this group, biological functions remained to be elucidated . we note that many of these  <dig> preserved intramodular hub genes are expressed ubiquitously. therefore, it is possible, perhaps even probable, that these genes are also co-expressed in other tissue types beyond brain and blood. their co-expression may therefore help serve to maintain differentiated cells in a particular state  in response to a particular environment , as well as enable other shared, basic cellular processes .

our study has several strengths including the use of multiple large data sets, carefully validated brain co-expression modules from oldham et al  <dig>  and a powerful statistical approach for evaluating module preservation.

but our study also has several limitations including the following. first, the brain expression data were measured using the affymetrix platform, while the blood expression data were measured using the illumina platform. since platform differences bias our results towards the null hypothesis of no preservation, we can be confident about preservation, but less confident about lack of preservation. the weak correlations between mean expression profiles may reflect platform differences. a second limitation is that we studied the preservation of brain modules in blood . our goal was to determine the preservation of robustly defined and well annotated brain modules. defining blood modules and studying their preservation in brain tissue is beyond the scope of this article. a third limitation is the relatively small set of genes considered for the co-expression module preservation study. oldham et al. had applied stringent filtering criteria to construct the brain network, which greatly reduced the number of probes considered in that study. after combining probes by gene symbol and merging the brain and blood data, the co-expression module preservation study focused on  <dig> ctx,  <dig> cb, and  <dig> cn network genes. we focused on this relatively small set of genes since their connectivity pattern in brain was found to be highly reproducible across array platforms and independent data sets . but we should point out that our study of mean expression preservation involved  <dig> genes. a fourth limitation is that we only use correlation network methodology. many alternative co-expression network methods have been proposed in the literature  <cit> . we focus on wgcna since i) this method was used in oldham et al , ii) it is highly robust  <cit> , and iii) it affords a geometric interpretation of network concepts  <cit> . an exploration of alternative procedures is beyond our scope but we encourage the reader to apply their method to our posted data.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we find that transcriptome organization is poorly preserved between brain and blood and only a handful of large brain co-expression modules that exhibit strong overall evidence of preservation in blood. however, these modules are not preserved whole cloth. instead, only certain aspects of these modules  exhibit strong preservation of gene co-expression relationships. the subset of preserved co-expression relationships characterized here may aid future efforts to identify blood biomarkers for neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases when brain tissue samples are unavailable.
