BACKGROUND
copepods play an important role in the aquatic ecosystem and are highly diverse. they comprise a multitude of taxa including  <dig> families,  <dig>  genera and  <dig>  species  <cit> , although this estimation may represent only 15% of the actual number  <cit> . copepods have successfully colonized almost all aquatic regimes and have developed diverse life styles  <cit> . therefore, phylogenetic studies are required to develop a complete biodiversity inventory of the group, which will enable the question of how copepods have acquired such diversity over time to be investigated.

several incompatible classification schemes have been proposed for copepods on the basis of morphological characteristics  <cit> . since the incorporation of copepods as a monophyletic group in  <dig>  phylogenetic studies have focused on the natural relationships between the incorporated orders, calanoida, cyclopoida, gellyelloida, harpacticoida, misophrioida, monstrilloida, mormonilloida, platycopioida, poecilostomatoida and siphonostomatoida  <cit> . dussart  classified calanoida and poecilostomatoida together in the lineage cyclopinidae-oithonidae-  <cit>  while other researchers have classified the calanoida outside podoplea, at the relative basal position  <cit> . kabata, marcotte and boxshall hypothesised that poecilostomatoida is the sister group to cyclopoida. however, other studies have placed poecilostomatoida and siphonostomatoida within close phylogenetic affinity  <cit> . recently, boxshall reassigned poecilostomatoida as a suborder of cyclopoida  <cit> . the relationships among copepods and other subgroups of pancrustacea have yet to be elucidated with  <dig> alternative sister group hypotheses being proposed for the taxon  <cit> . the recent ambiguous status of copepod phylogenetic research is due at least in part to the limited diagnostic morphological characteristics, difficulty in accessing morphological homology and a poor fossil record.

in metazoans, the mitochondrial genome is usually a circular, double-stranded dna molecule , which spans a general length of  <dig> kb but can vary from  <dig> to  <dig> kb. the gene content is conserved with  <dig> genes:  <dig> protein-encoding genes, two ribosomal rna genes,  <dig> transfer rna  genes and one or more non-coding region containing signals for transcription and replication of the mtdna  <cit> . several advantages including accelerated substitution rates,  unambiguous orthology and being genome-level informative  <cit>  have allowed the mitochondrial genome to be widely used for population studies  <cit> , phylogeography  <cit>  and phylogenetic relationships at various taxonomic levels across animal taxa, particularly in arthropods  <cit> . furthermore, extensive intraspecific polymorphism in the non-coding regions facilitates studies at population level  <cit> . however, there is little information concerning the structure and genetic polymorphism of the non-coding regions in crustaceans.

despite the vast diversity of copepods, few mitochondrial genomes have been charted. taxon sampling has been biased to certain orders including harpacticoida: tigriopus japonicus  <cit> , tigriopus californicus  <cit> ; siphonostomatoida: lepeophtheirus salmonis  <cit>  and cyclopoida: paracyclopina nana  <cit> . more mitochondrial genomes with increased taxon coverage are required to resolve several issues concerning copepod phylogeny including its phylogenetic position within pancrustacea and the relationship of its component orders. calanus sinicus  dominates continental shelf waters in the northwest pacific ocean, linking primary production and the larvae and juveniles of fishes  <cit> . given its ecological importance, c. sinicus is one of the target species in the china-globec program. despite this status, there is little information concerning the population genetics of this species owing to the lack of suitable genetic markers. this study presents a near complete mitochondrial genome of c. sinicus, which represents the first member of the calanoida. the gene order of c. sinicus was compared with other copepods to identify the evolution of the mitochondrial genomes in this group. combining the new mitogenome and previously published mitogenomes from arthropods, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis was carried out to investigate the relationships between several orders in copepoda and their positions within pancrustacea. in addition, intraspecific polymorphisms of major loci in  <dig> c. sinicus mitogenomes from four populations were compared to screen potential markers for population studies.

RESULTS
genome organization
a long-pcr-based genome sequencing protocol was adopted for animal mtdnas. however, this technique failed to amplify a fragment containing partial non-coding regions and two trna genes. several unknown factors including gene rearrangement, notable base composition bias, an extended length of gc-rich tract, highly repeated regions and stable secondary structures could terminate the movement of the polymerase and therefore complicate the recovery of mitogenomes from copepods using this technique  <cit> .

the  <dig>  bp assembled contig  comprised all but two trna genes , and included  <dig> protein coding genes , two rrna genes  and  <dig> trna genes. in addition, one of the long non-coding regions  between trnh and trna was proposed as a control region  on the basis of the secondary structure motifs identified. the majority of metazoan mitogenomes contain two abutting gene blocks, nad4/nad4l and rrns/rrnl. however, these are separated in copepods. the  <dig> genes were located in three clusters interleaved by long non-coding regions . unlike tigriopus sp.  <cit> , mitochondrial genes were encoded on both strands in c. sinicus, and the minority  were identified on the h-strand . of the  <dig> trna genes,  <dig> were arranged in three main clusters, v-d-t-s <dig>  f-i and a-f-y-e-q-l1-p-m-k-w-s1-n, reading clockwise. compactness is a characteristic feature of mitochondrial genomes  <cit>  and there were small gene overlaps at three gene borders. the largest overlap was identified between trny and trne, with a length of five nucleotides.

base composition and codon usage
the h-strand in the c. sinicus mitogenome comprises  <dig> % a,  <dig> % c,  <dig> % g and  <dig> % t. as presented in table  <dig>  the overall a + t content of c. sinicus is relatively low  in comparison with other crustaceans, but within the range for copepods, a minimum of  <dig> % in t. japonicus to a maximum of  <dig> % in p. nana . the same trend was observed in the protein coding genes  and non-coding sequences , which were lower than those in the majority of crustaceans. the a + t content of structural rna genes was much richer, being  <dig> % and  <dig> % for trna and rrna genes, respectively, which is comparable with other crustaceans.

metazoan mitogenomes normally bear a clear strand asymmetry in terms of nucleotide composition owing to asymmetric deamination of a and c nucleotides on each strand during replication and/or transcription processes  <cit> . however, there are approximately equal numbers of each complementary nucleotide pair in c. sinicus. when measured as at- and gc-skews / and /), the result is close to equality  for the former and only moderately positive  for the latter. similar results have been reported in other copepods . in contrast to the whole genome, an anti-a skewness was apparent for all pcgs  regardless of the strand on which they were encoded, while adenines were slightly preferred in all rrna genes . as demonstrated in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  over-representation of guanines emerges in rrna and trna genes. pcgs represent either neutral , negative  or positive gc-skewness. interestingly, all negative gc-skewed genes clustered in a gene block carrying the same transcriptional polarization, possibly because of an inversion or transcriptional polarization of the gene block.

to elucidate possible mechanisms that have shaped present-day nucleotide compositional strand asymmetry in the lineage, the gc-skewnesses for individual pcgs of copepods were compared with those of limulus polyphemus . the strand asymmetric profiles of copepods differed significantly from those of l. polyphemus in most pcgs. this suggests a global reversal of the skewness as a possible synapomorphy in the group, probably due to an ancestral inversion of the control region. however, specific nucleotide asymmetric profiles can be identified in all genes with the exception of cox <dig> and nad <dig>  possibly because of a shift in the transcriptional polarization of the genes. the 3rd position of the pcgs is less constrained, and they tend to accumulate nucleotide skewness more quickly, making them more likely to be at equilibrium. the opposite results for the skewness at different codons in several genes could be evidence for their recent inversions. therefore, a complex series of rearrangement events may have occurred in this lineage.

the pattern of codon usage in the c. sinicus mitogenome was studied . a preference for at-rich codons was identified in c. sinicus, as is the case in mitochondrial pcgs of other arthropods. for example, the most frequently used codons are uuu , followed by auu  and then aua . among copepods, the a + t content of the overall mitogenome is highly correlated with the corresponding values in degenerate synonymous sites of protein coding genes . the a + t-content of the 3rd codon positions  in c. sinicus, which is only slightly higher than that in t. japonicus, is lower than that in most other crustaceans.

protein coding genes
more than one reasonable start codon can be predicted for several genes. therefore, start codons were selected from the candidates following criteria to avoid large overlaps between genes and to keep a conserved length with other crustaceans. there are a total of  <dig>  nucleotides encoding  <dig> protein coding genes in c. sinicus, which are at least  <dig> nt longer than other copepod mitogenomes. the genes atp <dig> and atp <dig> are heavily truncated in other copepods but maintain the regular size in c. sinicus, predominantly contributing to the elongation of mitochondrial pcgs. each of the  <dig> protein-coding genes in c. sinicus start with a typical initiation codon atd: ata for cox <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad4l, att for atp <dig>  cox <dig>  nad <dig> and nad5- <dig>  and atg for the remainder. previous studies have reported several atypical initiation codons for cox <dig> in arthropods  <cit> . however, the copepods studied to date possess a regular start codon  for cox <dig> 

the majority of the  <dig> protein coding genes terminate with the conventional stop codons tag or taa, but nad <dig> and nad <dig> have truncated stop codons  adjacent to a downstream trna gene. the presence of incomplete stop codons is common in metazoan mitogenomes, and the shortened stop codons are likely to be completed via post-transcriptional polyadenylation  <cit> .

in view of the clear saturated mutation at the nucleotide level, the amino acids of pcgs were compared among copepods. as illustrated in table  <dig>  the overall amino acid divergences among the copepods was particularly high, ranging from  <dig>  in cox <dig> to  <dig>  in nad4l. in general, genes encoding proteins for complex i  of the electron transport chain were less conserved than others. altered mutation rates and relatively relaxed selective constraints  <cit>  are the two possible factors responsible for elevated divergence in mitochondrial genes for complex i. however, nadh genes are dispersed within mitogenomes of copepods. therefore, it is unlikely that several nadh genes would possess altered mutation rates with the same trend, simultaneously. the latter interpretation seems most plausible. structural or functional constraints at the protein level can lead to locus-specific selective pressures acting on mitochondrial genomes, giving rise to a higher divergence in some pcgs.

five copepods, the pcgs of which have been entirely determined, were selected for interspecific analysis. for the pcgs, divergence of amino acid was compared for the interspecific analyses, and the nucleotide divergence was outlined for the intraspecific comparisons. ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions for the  <dig> pcgs were compared. genes were labelled as outlined in the abbreviations section. db and ωb: p-distance and dn/ds among five copepods; dw and ωw: p-distance and dn/ds within c. sinicus.

 <dig> missing data due to the incomplete dataset;

 <dig> unfeasible parameter for the corresponding genes.

to examine the evolutionary forces acting on the mitochondrial pcgs of copepods, rates of non-synonymous substitution  versus synonymous substitution  were determined. the observed dn/ds ratios  were consistently lower than one, increasing from  <dig>  for cytb to  <dig>  for nad <dig>  this indicates a strong purifying selection within this lineage. values of dn/ds for genes of sparse polymorphism  were generally lower, in agreement with the idea that highly divergent genes are normally subjected to less selective pressure.

ribosomal rna genes
in the mitogenome of c. sinicus, the 16s ribosomal rna  and 12s ribosomal rna  genes are located between trnv/lnr <dig> and trng/nad <dig>  respectively. in arthropods, the rrna genes are normally adjacent on the same strand, interleaved by a single trnv. however, the two genes are distantly separated on either strand in c. sinicus, which is rare in metazoans. examples of the arrangement are mainly found in the primary lineages  <cit> . the size of rrns and rrnl genes in c. sinicus were calculated to be  <dig> bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively, on the basis of the alignment and comparison of their counterparts in n. cristatus. these lengths are similar to those of p. nana, but longer than corresponding lengths of other copepods. consistent with pcgs, the two rrna genes were determined to be highly divergent, with values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for rrns and rrnl, respectively . the secondary structure of rrns  was proposed on the basis of the model of gutell  <cit> , and rrnl  of the model of de rijk et al.  <cit> . in accordance with their phylogenetic relationships, the secondary structures of c. sinicus rrnas resembled those of crustacean  <cit>   more closely than those of insect .

compared with the insect d. yakuba, several compound helixes degenerate into a single one in the crustacean rrns secondary structures. both crustaceans lack helixes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> whereas the counterparts are present in d. yakuba. all helixes present in d. pulex are shared by c. sinicus with the exception of helix  <dig>  however, most loops and linking sequences between helixes are somewhat reduced, leading to a much shorter rrns in c. sinicus. the alignment of rrns genes for copepods indicates that 5' sequences upstream of helix  <dig> are more variable.

in terms of rrnl, upstream sequences of helix c <dig> were too ambitious to align. high diversity in this region has been reported in several species  <cit> , where some or all helixes are truncated  <cit> . helix g <dig>  present in d. yakuba, is absent in c. sinicus and d. pulex. in addition, the compound helix d13/d <dig> is replaced by one stem-loop, and helix h <dig> is absent in c. sinicus. the greatest sequence conservation was at the 3' end from helix g <dig> to h <dig>  consistent with the idea that this region is the main component of the transferase centre  <cit> .

transfer rna genes
though only partially sequenced,  <dig> of the  <dig> mitochondrial trna genes have been identified in the c. sinicus mitogenome on the basis of their potential cloverleaf structures and anti-codons . four trna genes overlap with one to five shared nucleotides. the extreme example was identified at the junction between trny and trne. the overlapped portions can be repaired by a post-transcriptional editing process  <cit> . gene lengths  and anti-codon usage are comparable with those generally observed in arthropods. however, trnk and trns <dig>  utilize ttt and tct rather than the more common ctt and gct. such substitutions on wobble positions can be found in other invertebrate mitogenomes  <cit> . as in other metazoans, anti-codons occasionally diverge from the most commonly used codons in degenerate codon families. for example, the most frequently used codon  for met contradicts the corresponding anti-codon .

complete cloverleaf structures containing the tΨc stem  and loop , variable loop, anti-codon stem  and loop , dhu  stem and loop , and the acceptor stem , can be predicted for  <dig> trnas, whereas the dhu arm is absent in trns <dig> . in addition, the dhu arm for another trns <dig>  is highly reduced, leaving a short stem  and a small loop . degenerative or unpaired dhu arms in trns are considered to be a common condition in arthropods  <cit> , and particularly in copepods  <cit> . as for other arthropods, the anti-codon is preceded by a uracil and followed by a purine in c. sinicus. deviating from the canonical mitochondrial trnas with four nucleotides in the variable loops,  <dig> nt variable loops were identified in trni and trns <dig> , and  <dig> nt variable loops were identified in trns <dig> .

non-coding sequences
within the fragment determined, there were  <dig>  bp non-coding sequences in total  distributed among  <dig> intergenic regions. six long non-coding regions larger than  <dig> bp were identified between atp <dig> and rrnl , cox <dig> and nad4l , trnh and trna , nad <dig> and cox <dig> , cox <dig> and nad <dig> , and nad <dig> and atp <dig> . six additional non-coding regions larger than  <dig> bp were discovered. the mitogenome of c. sinicus is one of the largest among arthropods owing to the prevalence and enlargement of non-coding regions. the concurrence of numerous large non-coding regions is unusual  <cit> . because of the deletional bias, large inactive regions tend to be eliminated from mitogenomes so that they become economical  <cit> . intergenic spacers are normally limited in number and size. as far as crustaceans are concerned, most mitochondrial genomes reported so far possess a single long non-coding region. exceptions to this include speleonectes tulumensis, hutchinsoniella macracantha  <cit>  and geothelphusa dehaani  <cit> . the largest non-coding sequences, rather than crs, are usually smaller than  <dig> bp  <cit> . to elucidate the origin of multiple non-coding regions, blast analysis was conducted on lnrs. with the exception of lnr <dig>  in which a  <dig> bp stretch similar to other crustacean rrns was screened, the blast analysis revealed that the lnrs of c. sinicus shared no significant similarities to any known sequences. therefore, independent origins and evolutionary processes are likely to have given rise to the various non-coding regions.

generally, large non-coding sequences act as control regions to initiate and/or regulate mitochondrial transcription and replication. however, functions of multiple heterologous non-coding regions are difficult to predict. at-richness is broadly accepted as a characteristic for the identification of crs. however, various cases have been reported  <cit> , and appear to be common in copepods. of five copepods, three possess equal  or lower  a + t-contents in their control regions. relatively lower at-contents are present in c. sinicus lnrs with the exception of lnr <dig> . although conserved sequence blocks  are common in control regions of metazoans  <cit> , such conservative properties among copepods were not detected. therefore, the control regions were screened on the basis of the secondary structure motifs.

several secondary structure motifs commonly found in control regions of arthropods  <cit>  were identified in lnr <dig> including:  a poly-t stretch  <dig> bp to the 3' end of lnr3;  a hairpin structure  on the l-strand  <dig> bp downstream of the poly-t stretch;  conserved sequences at the lateral ends of the hairpin structure; and  a microsatellite locus following the hairpin structure with "at" as the core repeat . these motifs make lnr <dig> the most likely candidate for the mitochondrial control region. however, hairpin structures were identified in other lnrs, which could be related to the mode of regulation of replication and transcription. considering the extreme complexity of the non-coding sequences in c. sinicus, more comparative and functional analyses are required to elucidate their exact roles during mitochondrial metabolism.

mitochondrial gene order
in addition to the multiplication of lnrs, a notably shuffled gene order was present. similar features were identified in a nonbilaterian species, nemateleotris magnifica  <cit> , but are rare in bilaterians  <cit> . mitochondrial gene order rearrangements are common among crustaceans, particularly in copepods  <cit> . in the case of c. sinicus, the mitochondrial genome is heavily rearranged. compared with other mitogenomes in the mitome database , c. sinicus has a unique gene order. comparison of the c. sinicus mitogenome to the ground pattern for arthropod mitogenomes  <cit>   revealed that the mitogenome was reshuffled. translocations were identified for all trna genes in the mitogenome of c. sinicus. among  <dig> gene boundaries, only two adjoining atp6-atp <dig> and nad6-cytb were retained. moreover,  <dig> genes  have developed a contrary transcriptional polarization: trnd, atp <dig>  atp <dig>  nad <dig>  trna and nad <dig> inverted from the l-strand to the h-strand, whereas trnf, trnp, nad <dig>  trnk, rrns and trnq were shifted from the h-strand to the l-strand.

in accordance with the high rate of sequence divergence between lineages, scrambled gene orders were observed among copepods. large-scale gene rearrangements were identified within the family calanidae  <cit> . owing to the small size and special secondary structures, trna genes are more mobile, and account for most translocations in crustaceans  <cit> . to avoid confusion initiated by reversal translocations of trna genes, the discussion of gene order is restricted to the protein-coding and rrna genes . complete reshuffling can be found in all copepod mitogenomes, leading to a divergent pattern of gene order in this group.

translocations involving protein coding or rrna genes are rare in metazoans  <cit> . such dramatic rearrangement of genes in copepods challenges the view of conservation of mitochondrial gene order, as suggested by unusual gene translocations in molluscs  <cit> . when pairwise gene orders of copepods are compared, there are few common intervals  indicated by results from crex  <cit> ; exceptions are two siphonostomatoid species belonging to the family caligidae . no conserved synteny is shared by the copepod samples studied here, questioning their homologous status. the similarities of gene order within the family calanidae and between the orders were compared, with no significant differences being identified. therefore, the phylogenetic signal may be diluted by frequent gene rearrangements within the lineage. the lack of unambiguous synapomorphic gene arrangements in copepods precludes their use in phylogenetic analysis concerning copepoda.

with regard to the rearrangement of mitochondrial genes, two major categories of mechanisms have been advanced:  tandem duplication followed by random or non-random deletion of excess genes  <cit> ; and  non-homologous recombination  <cit> . the first scenario is improbable in view of the presence of inversion or the absence of a conserved synteny. consequently, involvement of non-homologous recombination, which can invoke translocation and inversion, may be required. to date, there is no direct evidence of mitochondrial dna recombination in copepods. however, new evidence supporting recombination is emerging in invertebrates including molluscs  <cit> , nematodes  <cit>  and arthropods  <cit> . furthermore, the problematic circular subgenomic fragment identified in c. sinicus may provide additional insights concerning mitochondrial dna recombination in copepods.

technical problems during laboratory work
during the experiments an  <dig>  kb dna sequence was amplified, with reverse complementarity in its  <dig> bp long lateral ends. such a covalent sequence, which represents a circular dna molecule, is normally considered as a marker for the achievement of mitochondrial sequencing. however, the  <dig>  kb fragment at the 3' end of the sequence was incomplete, with several mitochondrial elements being absent . extended sequences were successfully determined with step-out pcrs  <cit> , and verified by long-pcr. therefore, the circular molecule was confirmed to be a sub-genomic fragment nested within the complete mtdna . the occurrence of the problematic circular subgenomic fragment could be explained by the following scenarios: first, the  <dig>  kb fragment could be nuclear copies of mitochondrial fragments   <cit> . numts are normally composed of fragmented copies shorter than  <dig> kb  <cit> . pseudogenes provide another notorious characteristic for the numts  <cit> . however, sequences of the coding genes in this problematic fragment compare favourably with the counterparts obtained from the cdna templates. indel and nonsense mutations were not present. therefore, because the sequences of coding genes in the  <dig>  kb fragment are almost identical to those obtained from reverse transcriptase pcr , with only three substitutions in the  <dig> nucleotides being compared, this first scenario is unlikely.

second, the  <dig>  kb fragment could be an artefact of pcr jumping when site-specific lesions exist or initial copies in the template are few  <cit> . fresh materials were used for the amplification to reduce the possibility of pcr jumping as breaks in the template would give rise to the bouncing of primers. unfortunately, abnormal nucleotides or stable stem-and-loop structures in the unidentified regions may have acted in a similar manner to breaks, causing the extending primer to jump to another template during pcr.

finally, the circular subgenomic fragment could be the product of mitochondrial dna recombination. recombination is normally absent in mitochondrial genomes of metazoans, but convincing evidence for this process has emerged  <cit> . a defined feature of recombination is the breakage and rejoining of participating dna strands  <cit> . according to lunt's recombination model, subgenomic circular molecules with the same gene organizations but smaller in size could be generated during recombination. the erroneous fragment mentioned above is consistent with lunt's model  <cit> , suggesting that recombination occurred. the results highlight the possibility of mitochondrial dna recombination in copepods.

such puzzles may be common to all copepod studies and caution should be applied when using long pcr technology to define complete mitochondrial genomes. additional long pcrs are required to confirm whether the mitochondrial genome sequence is complete.

phylogenetic analysis
homogeneity of the stationary frequencies across the tree is a baseline for current phylogenetic models. therefore, amino acid alignments were used for inference of phylogeny as they are more homogenous among different lineages than nucleotide content  <cit> . as presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  monophyly of pancrustacea and most of its high-level subtaxa including the classes collembola, diplura, insecta and malacostraca, and the subclasses copepoda and cirripedia, were supported irrespective of the model and method applied. bootstrap support values  from maximum likelihood  analyses were usually lower in the current analysis, suggesting that the phylogenetic signal was weak or that a competing artificial signal was present. ml analyses are believed to be vulnerable to several factors including lineage-specific evolutionary rate heterogeneities and nucleotide compositional heterogeneities, which can impede the recovery of phylogenetic signals  <cit> . hence, this study concentrated on the topology recovered by bayesian inference , but included ml trees.

monophyly of copepods was well resolved in the results and in a former mitochondrial phylogenetic inference with expanded out-group sampling . consensus has been reached for the monophyly of copepoda on the basis of morphological and molecular evidence  <cit> , whereas the phylogenetic relationships among component orders are still controversial. as far as the phylogenetic relationships among copepods are concerned, congruent results were obtained from different analyses during the current research . harpacticoida  and monophyletic siphonostomatoida  grouped together, with the cluster containing poecilostomatoida  and cyclopoida  as their sister clade. the grouping of the four orders, excluding calanoida, confirms the monophyly of podoplea, which is characteristically tagged by the podoplean tagmosis  <cit> . the basal splitting of copepoda separated calanoida from podoplea, reflecting the primary status of calanoida within copepods. with regard to inter-ordinal phylogenetic relationships within podoplea, huys et al. proposed an early split between mcg-clade  and mhpsm-clade , where poecilostomatoida and cyclopoida separated into distinct lineages soon after podoplea was formed  <cit> . however, similar to the results from huys, based on 18s rrna  <cit> , cyclopoida and poecilostomatoida exhibited closer affinity in this study, supporting boxshall's hypothesis to reunite poecilostomatoida into cyclopoida. this view is gaining support from several independent analyses  <cit> . accordingly, the present results support the hypotheses for , ).

the position of copepoda within pancrustacea is still unclear; the present analyses produced conflicting results using different methods. the uncertainty regarding the position of copepoda within pancrustacea is in part due to heterogeneity in evolutionary rates and nucleotide compositions within the lineage  <cit> , and may be exacerbated by the derived nature of copepod mitochondrial sequences. considering that copepods possess notably biased nucleotide compositional profiles, the recovery of the phylogenetic signal may be impeded by lineage-specific compositional heterogeneity. however, exclusion of strand-biased amino acids does not change the relative position of copepoda , indicating that heterogeneous nucleotide composition may not play a key role in misleading phylogenetic analysis. nevertheless, accelerated substation rates of copepods do mask and erode phylogenetic signals by attracting long-branched taxa together. one example concerns the previously well-accepted monophyletic group branchiopoda  <cit> , which was resolved polyphyletically by clustering a. franciscana with copepods in the original and balanced dataset under the mtart model. however, analyses performed with only characters carrying a moderate evolutionary rate or with the cat + mtart, which has been confirmed as an effective model to overcome the effects of long branch attraction   <cit> , consistently resolved a monophyletic branchiopoda clade. consequently, a possible lba artefact could be introduced by the accelerated rate of evolution of the mitochondrial genomes of the sampled copepods and branchiopod. therefore, the clustering of a. franciscana and copepods was regarded as a phylogenetic artefact due to the lba rather than a sister grouping.

as for the position of copepoda, four possible sister groups have been proposed in the present study :  oligostraca including ostracoda, pentastomida, branchiura  <cit> ,  oligostraca plus remipedia under the model of mtart and  branchiopoda,  branchiopoda plus malacostraca under the model of cat + mtart. it should be noted that by inspecting branch lengths, copepoda, oligostraca and remipedia are rapidly evolving lineages. a decrease in support  for the close affinity of oligostraca and copepoda was observed in mtart trees with the moderate-rate sites. therefore, their grouping may be misleading owing to the artefact concerning the lba, as the mtart model is vulnerable to lba artefacts. consequently, although only moderately supported , the results obtained with the cat + mtart model, in which copepoda was clustered in the monophyletic clade vericrustacea, which joins malacostraca, branchiopoda, thecostraca and copepoda, are accepted in the present study. these results are compatible with a previous phylogenetic analysis based on nuclear protein-coding sequences  <cit> .

the relationships among pancrustacean lineages are highly unstable, but several interesting findings resolved using various methods are noted. a monophyletic origin of pancrustacea  is strongly supported by the current analyses, as recovered by a number of molecular studies on the bases of sequence data  <cit>  or mitochondrial gene orders  <cit> . in accordance with other mitochondrial studies  <cit> , monophyly of hexapoda and crustacea was rejected in the present study, although relationships among the component lineages remain unstable. however, it is noteworthy that the affinity of insecta and collembola was resolved under the model of cat + mtart, while the grouping of collembola with diplura was recovered under the model of mtart using only moderate-rate sites. these results prevent the rejection of the monophyly of hexapoda on the basis of mitochondrial genomic data alone. contradictory conclusions from mitochondrial sequences and nuclear sequences  <cit>  mean that the monophyly of hexapoda and crustacea are open questions. traditional but controversial maxillopoda was resolved paraphyletic/polyphyletic in the present analyses, where it can be sub-divided into three groups including copepoda, cirripedia and pentastomida plus branchiura. this division of maxillopoda is in agreement with recent studies based on combined data of 18s rrna and two mitochondrial markers  <cit> , and nuclear protein-coding genes  <cit> .

intraspecific sequence variability and its utility for population genetic analysis
the major loci were scanned on the basis of the alignment of  <dig> mitogenomes from four populations for proper molecular markers. no evidence for recombination in the mitogenome of c. sinicus was detected. within the  <dig>  bp alignment  there were a total of  <dig> variable sites including  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  comprising  <dig> nucleotide substitutions and  <dig> insertion/deletion polymorphic sites, in addition to three microsatellite motifs. a sliding-window analysis was performed to map the distribution of variable sites among  <dig> individuals in dnasp  <cit>  . the mean frequency of the variable sites was relatively low . lnr <dig>  harbouring two microsatellite motifs, was most variable, while nad4l was the most conserved with no changed sites. the "hotspots" bearing the highest frequency of variable sites were bases 11216- <dig> with  <dig> variable sites in  <dig> bases , 1848- <dig> with  <dig> variable sites in  <dig> bases , and 649- <dig> with  <dig> variable sites in  <dig> bases . the former corresponds to lnr <dig>  and the others span lnr <dig> and upstream of rrnl. the gene encoding cox <dig> is used wildly as molecular marker for analysis at the population level  <cit> . however, a  <dig> bp stretch spanning 4016- <dig>  which is located in the gene of cox <dig>  has no variable site. the results revealed the conserved nature of cox <dig> and eliminated the possibility of its utility in population genetics for c. sinicus. constant phylogenetic signals, which distinguish haplotype groups, were detected in the hyper-variable regions , underpinning their utility for population analysis.

non-coding regions are most variable, followed by pcgs and rrna genes, with trna genes being the most conserved . no deletions or insertions were identified in the coding regions. of the  <dig> nucleotide substitutions,  <dig> % were identified as parsimony informative. a distinct bias for nucleotide transitions over transversions was evident, with 87% substitutions being transitions.

of the  <dig> snps in pcgs, only  <dig> can give rise to amino acid substitutions. the majority of the snps  are located in wobble codon positions. only  <dig> % were identified in second positions, all of which lead to amino acid substitutions. among pcgs, nad <dig> is most divergent . as presented in table  <dig>  intraspecific dn/ds ratios were either zero or at relatively high levels, ranging from  <dig>  for atp <dig> to  <dig>  for nad <dig>  the overall intraspecific dn/ds ratio was  <dig>  times larger than the counterpart between species, which is compatible with a nearly neutral model in which most amino acid substitutions are slightly deleterious  <cit> .

in terms of the  <dig> nucleotide substitutions in structural rna genes, seven were situated in stems and the remainder in loops. three substitutions in stems induced deterioration of stem connections. however, they were all present at lateral margins, indicating little influence on the overall secondary structures. as mentioned above, such mis-pairing is considered to be restored during transcription.

in addition to substitution and indel variations, three microsatellite motifs were identified at regions from bases  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  "tcc" unit is the core repeat for the first motif, while "ta" acts as a core repeat for the others. the second microsatellite is most variable with repeat numbers from  <dig> to  <dig>  with additional subtle sequence variations within the motif, the  <dig> sequenced microsatellite loci can be sub-divided into seven alleles.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the first nearly complete mitochondrial genome of a calanoida species. the circular subgenomic fragment obtained invoked caution when analyzing the mitogenome of copepods using long pcr technology, and may offer additional evidence for mitochondrial recombination.

although the contents and lengths of individual genes are similar to other arthropods, the mitogenome of c. sinicus, one of the largest mtdnas in crustaceans, is enlarged by the prevalence and extended length of non-coding regions. the concurrence of multiple non-coding regions and reshuffled gene arrangement results in the mitochondrial genome of c. sinicus being remarkably distinctive from other arthropods. mitochondrial dna recombination may have played an important role in shaping the present mitochondrial profile of c. sinicus. the lack of synapomorphic gene arrangements among copepods raises questions concerning the use of gene order as a useful molecular marker for deep phylogenetic analysis.

recovery of the phylogenetic signal in mitochondrial genomes may be affected a variety of reconstruction artefacts including lineage-specific heterogeneities for nucleotide composition and evolutionary rate. in particular, the lba artefact influenced the results during analysis. several methods were designed to reduce the dilution effect of the reconstruction artefacts. although unstable, some inspiring congruent results were noticed in the analyses. monophyly of copepods and the basal split between calanoida and podoplea were successfully resolved. the close affinity between cyclopoida and poecilostomatoida in the present study supports boxshall in reassigning the latter subordinate to the former. copepoda was clustered within the monophyletic clade vericrustacea, although relationships among the lineages remain ambiguous. falsification of maxillopoda was confirmed by unveiling its paraphyletic/polyphyletic nature. however, owing to the limited phylogenetic signals in the mitochondrial data sets, no consensus concerning relationships among pancrustacean lineages was reached.

within the  <dig>  bp alignment there are a total of  <dig> variable sites. indel variations are present in non-coding regions and transitions dominate the nucleotide substitutions. three "hot-spots", particularly the hyper-variable microsatellite locus in lnrs, provide rich polymorphisms for population studies.
