BACKGROUND
chromatin is comprised of repeating nucleosome units consisting of ~ <dig> base pairs of dna coiled around an octamer of four core histone proteins   <cit> . the chromatin surrounding the actively transcribed genes is relaxed, and importantly, a nucleosome-depleted region  is observed immediately upstream the transcriptional start site. the presence of a ndr is characteristic of both cpg-rich  <cit>  and cpg-poor  <cit>  promoters where transcription factors  can approach to facilitate transcription.

gene regulatory elements are intrinsically dynamic and alternate between inactive and active states through the recruitment of dna binding proteins, such as chromatin remodelers, that regulate nucleosome stability  <cit> . the formation of open chromatin, or nucleosome disassembly, and its association with transcriptional activity are an evolutionarily conserved characteristic  <cit> . to date, faire   <cit> , or faire-seq , is extensively used to identify cell-specific chromatin states, and to investigate the relationship between chromatin structures and diseases  <cit> . for example, waki et al. performed computational motif analysis of the adipocyte-specific faire peaks  and discovered an enrichment of a binding motif for nuclear family i  transcription factors  <cit> . in addition, song et al. analyzed faire-seq and dnase-seq data in seven cell lines and identified cell-specific regulatory elements  <cit> . those studies take advantage of such technology to further reveal the nature of gene regulation. nevertheless, the effects of allele-specific variations were not considered, and we believe that they may play important roles in chromatin structures.

recently, rozowsky et al. integrated rna-seq, chip-seq and the diploid genome sequence to identify allele-specific tf binding sites  <cit> . meanwhile, mcdaniell et al. integrated dnase-seq, ctcf chip-seq and parent–child trios to identify heritable allele-specific chromatin signatures  <cit> . however, de novo dna motifs associated with allele-specific chromatin accessibility have not been reported yet. therefore, we developed the first method for discovering de novo dna motifs associated with chromatin accessibility using faire-seq and the diploid genome sequence. we mapped the faire-seq reads to the diploid genome and found differential chromatin-state regions  using heterozygous snps. the dcsr pairs represent the locations of imbalances of chromatin accessibility between alleles and are ideal to identify motifs that may directly modulate chromatin accessibility  <cit> .

RESULTS
identifying dcsrs
in this study, we developed a unique genome-wide method to discover dna motifs associated with chromatin accessibility. we used a publicly available faire-seq dataset with gm <dig> cells from ucsc genome browser  <cit>  and obtained the corresponding diploid genome sequences from alleleseq  <cit> . the diploid genome allows us to identify binding motifs that differ between alleles and that correspond to differences in chromatin accessibility. the bowtie tool  <cit>  was used to align faire-seq reads to the genome without any mismatch. using faire-seq reads and heterozygous snps, we can distinguish the reads from paternal or maternal alleles . therefore, the chromatin state  can be determined based on the read depth on heterozygous snps . in other words, the genomic regions with high faire-seq read depth indicate accessible chromatin.

examining all heterozygous snps  across the genome, we selected the locations with a significant difference in chromatin accessibility between the two alleles. the dcsrs were selected with the following conditions: a snp was taken into consideration when its read depth had a fold change of > <dig>  and its greater read depth was at least  <dig> by faire-seq reads. next, a dcsr was defined to be ± <dig> bases surrounding such snp, i.e.  <dig> bases in total. we used  <dig> base pairs from both paternal and maternal alleles to build a dcsr pair .

as a result, we identified a total of  <dig>  dcsr pairs in the gm <dig> genome, among which  <dig> are in the promoter regions ,  <dig>  in genes, and  <dig>  in the intergenic regions . for each pair of dcsrs, we identified the dcsr possessing the higher read depth as accessible chromatin, whereas that possessing the lower read depth as inaccessible chromatin. figure 1a shows the faire-seq read depth in the diploid genome, and figure 1b shows that we identified dcsrs and established accessible and inaccessible chromatin groups.

it is noteworthy that a fully phased diploid genome is important to this study because of the adjacent snp/indel effect as follows: first, if the distance between the adjacent variations is shorter than the read length, it will affect dcsr detection by changing faire read alignment. second, if the distance between adjacent variations is <  <dig> bp, it will affect chromatin motif detection by changing motif frequencies between paternal and maternal alleles.

discovering conserved motifs with significant changes in the occurrence frequency among dcsrs
most of the dcsrs differ in one base from their pairs, implying the snp directly affects chromatin accessibility . when a heterozygous snp occurs in a binding site of a tf, either a histone modification enzyme  itself or a hme-recruiting protein, it may determine the state of chromatin. thus, snps among the dcsrs are essential since they carry the information related to the chromatin accessibility. we thus defined the binding motifs associated with chromatin accessibility as chromatin motifs.

using dna 6-10mer sequences to interrogate all dcsrs, we subsequently discovered conserved chromatin motifs with significant changes in occurrence frequency between accessible and inaccessible dcsrs . additional file  <dig> shows the chromatin motifs with occurrence rates in inaccessible and accessible chromatin groups in genome-wide regions . there are  <dig>  motifs, totally, and  <dig>  of them have higher occurrences in accessible regions than in inaccessible regions. to further eliminate the motifs with low occurrences that might be false positives, we selected motifs that have p values <  <dig>  and occurrence rates > 1%. it resulted in  <dig> genome-wide,  <dig> intergenic, and  <dig> genic chromatin motifs . since promoter regions only have  <dig> dcsrs, the number of dcsrs is too small to discover significant motifs. thus, we did not find any chromatin motif with a p value <  <dig>  in promoter regions.

annotating chromatin motifs using tf databases
grewal and jia suggested that tfs can recognize specific dna sequences to nucleate heterochromatin structures  <cit> . in the same analogy, we proposed that a chromatin motif that can be recognized by a tf may modulate chromatin accessibility . to discover such tfs and to annotate our chromatin motifs, we used two tf databases, the transcription factor encyclopedia   <cit>  and the human protein-dna interactome  database constructed using protein microarray assays  <cit> , . as a result, over 60% of motifs can be annotated, and they are listed in table  <dig> 

to investigate the chromatin motifs and demonstrate the biological significance of the chromatin motifs, we studied the protein annotations of the top ten chromatin motifs in genome-wide, intergenic and genic regions, respectively . within the top ten chromatin motifs, seven genome-wide motifs, six intergenic motifs, and two genic motifs have tf annotations. surprisingly, most of these annotated motifs have biological reports associated with chromatin remodeling as follows:

max: myc and mad compete with each other to form a heterodimer with max  <cit> , and the resulting myc/max or mad/max protein complex binds to the cacgtg motif through its basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domains  <cit> . the myc/max heterodimer is a co-activator that recruits multiple histone acetyl transferase to maintain euchromatin status, whereas the mad/max a co-repressor that recruits histone deacetylase  to repress transcription. moreover, lee et al. identified the genomic binding locations of myc across  <dig> different human cell lines using chip-seq, and the myc motif in gm <dig> is ccacgtg  <cit> . this finding is consistent with our top motif cacgtg. rxr/rara: rxr/rara recruits histone deacetylase and represses transcription  <cit> . in addition, rxr/rara functions as a local chromatin modulator  <cit> . sox9: sox <dig> interacts with chromatin and activates transcription through the regulation of chromatin modification  <cit> . mef2a: the interactions between myod homodimers and mef <dig> proteins may direct hmes to the chromatin  <cit> . hcfc2: hcfc <dig> and hcfc <dig> are the core components of the mll <dig> complex, which is a histone methyltransferase acting as a positive global regulator during gene transcription  <cit> . usf1/usf2: usf1/usf <dig> heterodimer recruits hmes and maintains the chromatin barrier  <cit> .

validation
to systematically validate our method, we defined non-differential chromatin-state regions  by the following conditions: the heterozygous snps have a read-depth fold change <  <dig>  and the greater allele read depth at least  <dig> by faire-seq reads. we identified a total of  <dig>  pairs of ndcsrs in the gm <dig> genome, and then we performed the same framework to obtain significant motifs on ndcsr. additional file  <dig> shows the top  <dig> dcsr and ndcsr motifs with tf annotation. to investigate whether the tf annotation has enrichment with chromatin remodeling, we selected three chromatin-specific go terms as follows: go: <dig> chromatin remodeling, go: <dig> histone modification, and go: <dig> chromatin dna binding. in additional file  <dig>  29% of dcsr motifs have chromatin-specific annotation and only 8% of ndcsr motifs have chromatin-specific annotation , suggesting the significant enrichment with chromatin-specific annotation.

to investigate the association of myc allele-specific binding and differential chromatin-state regions, we applied our method to myc chip-seq data. the gm <dig> myc chip-seq and control data were downloaded from geo gse <dig>  <cit> . the bowtie tool  <cit>  was used to map chip-seq reads to the gm <dig> diploid genome to select perfect match and unique mapping tags, which later were fed tochip-seq processing pipeline  <cit>  to discover narrow peaks with fdr <  <dig> . to investigate whether myc allele-specific binding associates to dcsrs, we calculated the number of dcsrs/ndcsrs with allele-specific or non-allele-specific myc peaks, and then performed pearson's chi-squared test . out result suggests that the differential chromatin-state regions and allele-specific myc bindings have a significant association .

the most significant motif, cacgtg
in table  <dig>  cacgtg is the most significant motif in both genome-wide  and intergenic regions . interestingly, myc/max, mad/max and usf1/usf <dig> bind to this motif, and these proteins play the following important roles in chromatin remodeling: the usf1/usf <dig> heterodimer recruits hmes to the insulator sites to maintain the chromatin barrier  <cit> . in mouse studies, myc and mad compete with each other to be heterodimerized with max  <cit> , and the resulting myc/max heterodimer or mad/max heterodimer binds to the cacgtg motif through its basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domains  <cit> . myc/max heterodimer is a co-activator to recruit multiple histone acetyltransferase to maintain euchromatin status, whereas mad/max is a co-repressor that recruits histone deacetylase  to repress transcription.

we also found that the significant chromatin motifs are not motifs with high occurrence rate. for example, cacgtg has a low occurrence rate of  <dig> % in the inaccessible chromatin groups and a low occurrence rate of  <dig> % in the accessible chromatin groups .

CONCLUSIONS
recently, an increasing number of studies have reported that chromatin accessibility is associated with diseases such as huntington's disease  <cit> , muscular dystrophy  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit>  and pancreatic cancer  <cit> , reflecting its importance in biology. our method is the first one to use a diploid genome and faire-seq to discover motifs associated with chromatin accessibility, which leads to the first chromatin motif database . the cmd provides the potential dna motifs recognized by chromatin-remodeling proteins.
