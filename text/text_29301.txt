BACKGROUND
stressors including salinity, limited water availability, extreme temperatures and fungal pathogens severely limit crop productivity  <cit> . cotton is the world’s most important natural textile fiber and a significant oilseed crop. four cultivated cotton species have been domesticated independently, including the tetraploids g. hirsutum l.  <dig> and g. barbadense l.  <dig>  and diploids g. herbaceum l.  and g. arboreum l. . among these, allotetraploid upland cotton has significant advantages including high yield potential and adaptability to diverse environments, accounting for >95% of worldwide cotton production . one of the major ways to sustain increases in cotton production in many regions of the world affected by abiotic and biotic stresses involves mining key genes for stress tolerance improvement. protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are major defense mechanisms for controlling cellular functions in response to external signals. the mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade is one of the universal signaling pathways involved in responses to external stimuli  <cit> . mapk cascades are composed of three sequentially activated kinase, i.e., map kinase kinase kinase , map kinase kinase  and map kinase   <cit> . mapks are a specific class of serine/threonine protein kinases. as the last component of the mapkkk-mapkk-mapk cascade, mapk plays crucial roles in signal transduction of extracellular stimuli in eukaryotes by phosphorylating various downstream targets  <cit> .

according to amino acid sequencing, mapk contains  <dig> domains  that are necessary for the catalytic function of serine/threonine protein kinase, and domains vii and viii of mapks are well conserved  <cit> . mapks carry either a thr-glu-tyr  or thr-asp-tyr  phosphorylation motif at the active site, which can be classified into four major groups  based on the presence of tdy and tey motifs  <cit> .

recently, a number of studies employing molecular and biochemical approaches have revealed that plant mapks play an important role in responses to a broad variety of biotic and abiotic stresses including wounding, pathogen infection, temperature, drought and salinity stress as well as plant hormones  <cit> . utilizing genome-wide scans, the mapk gene family has been systematically investigated in arabidopsis  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> are involved in stress responses, and both mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> are dependent on salicylic acid signaling  <cit> . in addition, mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in arabidopsis are also related to the cold stress response  <cit> . several studies on mapks have been reported in cotton. ghmpk <dig> and gbmpk <dig> are upregulated by diverse abiotic stresses and likely play a role in drought and oxidative stress tolerance  <cit> . ghmpk <dig> plays an important role in abscisic acid -induced catalase <dig> expression and h2o <dig> production  <cit> , while ghmpk6a negatively regulates osmotic stress and bacterial infection  <cit> . two additional mapks, ghmpk <dig> and ghmpk <dig>  are involved in plant defense responses and the regulation of certain components of multiple stress-signaling pathways  <cit> . nevertheless, our knowledge of the mapk gene family in cotton is limited.

the completion of the genome-sequencing project for g. raimondii has made it possible for the first time to identify mapk family members in gossypium species on a genome-wide scale. in this study, we identified  <dig> putative mapk genes in the g. raimondii genome and analyzed their sequence phylogeny, genomic structure, chromosomal location and adaptive evolution. our data, combined with sequence data from g. raimondii  and ests from different cotton species in the ncbi databases , led to the identification of  <dig> cdna sequences of mapks with complete orfs in g. hirsutum via pcr-based approaches, including  <dig> novel mapks and eight with homologs reported previously in tetraploid cotton. we investigated the temporal and spatial expression profiles of mapk genes in different tissues and in response to different hormone, temperature and stress treatments in tetraploid cultivated cotton species. furthermore, we verified the functional roles of three mapks that are significantly induced by verticillium dahlia in response to cotton v. dahliae resistance. this study opens up the possibility of exploring the use of mapks to improve stress tolerance in future cotton-breeding programs.

RESULTS
genome-wide identification of mapk genes and their chromosomal distribution
to identify mapk genes from g. raimondii, hmmer software version  <dig>   <cit>  and the pfam protein families database with the mapk domain   <cit>  were used to screen the g. raimondii genomic database   <cit> . furthermore, we used  <dig> arabidopsis mapk protein sequences as direct queries to screen the potential mapks. these predicted grmapk sequences were confirmed by fgenesh  and the conserved protein domains in their sequences were analyzed by expasy proteomics server   <cit> . after extensive bioinformatics analysis of the g. raimondii genome databases, a total of  <dig> mapk genes were identified. in addition, we anchored expressed sequence tag  sequences for four cotton species, gossypium hirsutum , g. barbadense , g. arboreum  and g. raimondii , which we downloaded from the genbank est database . we found that  <dig> ests, including  <dig> from g. raimondii,  <dig> from g. hirsutum,  <dig> from g. barbadense and  <dig> from g. arboreum matched these mapk members with at least one est hit . these mapk genes were predicted to encode proteins  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length, with putative molecular weights ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda and pis ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

to elucidate the chromosomal distribution of these mapk genes, we integrated  <dig> scaffolds of the g. raimondii genome  from paterson et al.  <cit>  with a previously reported high-density interspecific genetic map of allotetraploid cultivated cotton species  <cit> . the collinearity between the genetic map and the cotton d <dig> genome revealed homologs between  <dig> dt chromosomes in tetraploid cotton species and  <dig> scaffolds of g. raimondii. we reordered the  <dig> scaffolds of g. raimondii according to the corresponding d <dig> to d <dig> chromosomes in tetraploid cotton species  <cit> . as a result,  <dig> candidate mapk genes were matched to  <dig> scaffolds of the d <dig> genome, except for corresponding chromosomes d <dig> and d <dig>  we designated mpk <dig> to mpk <dig> based on the order of the homologs on chromosomes . the chromosomal distribution pattern of these mapk genes is non-random. for example, five mapks are found on d <dig>  while four mapks each are found on d <dig> and d <dig>  the remaining members are also localized to different chromosomes: three mapks each are present on d <dig> and d11; two mapks each are present on d <dig>  d <dig> and d10; only one mapk is present on d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  respectively. information about the mapk genes, including their gene names, origins, chromosome locations, isoelectric points , molecular weights  and subcellular localizations, are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> figure  <dig>

g. raimondii. the chromosome numbers are indicated at the top of each bar. the chromosome numbers from d <dig> to d <dig>  and d <dig> to d <dig> were consistent with our newly-updated interspecific genetic map in allotetraploid cultivated cotton species reported recently , and the scaffolds name from g. raimindii genome was showed in the bracket. lines were drawn to connect duplicated genes. the nomaclature of mapks were based on the order of the chromosomes in g. raimondii.



classification, structure and variation of mapk genes in gossypium raimondii
alignment of grmapk amino acid sequences revealed that all of the grmapk proteins contain  <dig> domains . tey or tdy motifs of grmapks are located in the activation loop between kinase subdomain vii and viii. all grmapk protein sequences contain four types of special subdomains, including the active site, atp binding site, substrate-binding site and activation loop . phylogenetic analysis indicated that grmapk could be divided into four major groups , with five members in group a, seven in group b, six in group c and  <dig> in group d. grmapks in subgroup a, b, c possess a thy-glu-tyr  and a short c-terminus containing a common docking  domain consisting of the sequence dxxepxc, whereas those of subgroup d possess a thr-asp-tyr  activation domain, without a cd domain but with a relatively long c-terminal region.figure  <dig> 
comparison of the amino acid sequences of grmapks. roman numerals indicate regions containing the  <dig> domains  found in the cotton pk subdomains. the a-loop, cd-domain and phosphorylation-activation motif  are indicated with red boxes.



analysis of exon/intron structures further revealed the classification of the grmapk family . grmapks in groups a and b exhibit a highly conserved distribution of exons and introns consisting of six exons of conserved length and five introns of variable sizes. each mapk in group c contains only two similarly sized exons, except that grmpk <dig> has a shorter intron. compared with these three highly conserved groups, mapks in group d show a complex distribution of exons and introns; grmpk <dig> and grmpk <dig> have  <dig> exons, grmpk <dig> and grmpk <dig> have  <dig> exons, while the others are composed of nine exons.figure  <dig>

the phylogenetic relationships of mapk genes have been systematically investigated in arabidopsis  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . here, to examine the evolutionary relationships of mapk members in g. raimondii and other species,  <dig> mapk genes in arabidopsis,  <dig> in g. max,  <dig> in o. sative and  <dig> in g. raimondii were individually selected to construct an unrooted tree based on the alignment of the full mapk amino acid sequences using the maximum likelihood method via mega <dig>   <cit> . the information for mapk genes from different species was showed in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis indicated that all of the mapks could be classified into the a, b, c, d and e groups . interestingly, more mapk members from arabidopsis, g. max and g. raimondii contain the tey phosphorylation site than the tdy motif. there are  <dig> atmapks,  <dig> gmmapks and  <dig> grmapks containing the tey motif, whereas eight atmapks,  <dig> gmmapks and  <dig> grmapks belong to the tdy groups, with an exception of six gmmapks containing the tqy motif. by contrast, the rice genome contains more mapks with the tdy phosphorylation site than the tey motif;  <dig> osmapks have the tdy motif but only seven contain the tey motif. these results indicate that mapks containing the tey motif might play more important roles in dicot plants than mapks containing the tdy motif. the orthlogous relationship among mapk genes in g. raimondii, arabidopsis, o. sativa and g. max was showed in additional file 3: table s <dig> figure  <dig>

recent studies have shown that the g. raimondii genome has undergone at least two rounds of genome-wide duplication  <cit> . to understand the expansion mechanism of the g. raimondii mapk gene family, we investigated tandem and segmental duplication events of mapk gene family members on the  <dig> chromosomes by genome synteny analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> paralogs in 28 g. raimondii mapks were identified, including  <dig> segmental duplication events between chromosomes and one tandem duplication event within the same chromosome . furthermore, these paralogs are clustered together in the phylogenic tree and share similar exon-intron structures. these results indicate that segmental duplication events have played a significant role in mapk gene expansion in the g. raimondii genome.

cloning and expression analysis of mapk genes in g. hirsutum acc. tm-1
based on predicted sequence information, we performed pcr cloning of mapk genes by designing gene-specific primers  and amplifying the transcripts of given tissues of g. hirsutum acc. tm- <dig>  we ultimately obtained  <dig> mapk cdna sequences with complete orfs , including  <dig> novel mapks and eight with homologs that had been reported previously, with seven in upland cotton and one in sea island cotton . other seven genes with partial cdna sequences were also identified.

to explore the possible physiological functions of mapks, we designed gene-specific qrt-pcr primers  to elucidate the expression levels of mapk genes in tetraploid cotton. in total, we detected the expression patterns of  <dig> mapk genes in different tissues and organs of g. hirsutum acc. tm- <dig>  including roots, stems, leaves, petals, anthers, ovules and fibers at three different developmental stages . as shown in figure  <dig>  mapks from different groups showed diverse expression patterns in different tissues and organs, with partial overlap observed in a range of physiological processes. in detail, expression pattern of individual gene for each tissue/organ tested was showed in additional file 5: figure s <dig> figure  <dig>

first, five genes, including mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in group a and mpk <dig> in group c, were predominantly expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs, with the highest expression observed for mpk <dig> in all tissues and organs examined. second, mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  showed preferential expression in vegetative organs; mpk <dig> was ubiquitously expressed in all organs and preferentially expressed in roots, while mpk <dig> showed that the highest expression levels in leaf tissues, with 10-fold higher expression in leaves than in other organs. third, nine genes were predominantly expressed in reproductive organs. of these, four genes, including mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in group b and mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in group d, had the highest expression levels in fiber tissues, and five genes, including mpk <dig> in group c and mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in group d, were preferentially expressed in anthers, petals or both. two additional genes, mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  were expressed moderately in reproductive organs, with preferential expression in fibers at different developmental stages. fourth, five genes, i.e., mpk <dig> in group b, mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in group c, and mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in group d, showed very low levels of expression in all tested tissues and organs. these results indicate that mapk genes from the same or different groups showed differential but overlapping expression patterns in different tissues, suggesting that genes belonging to the same group may have diverse functions, whereas mapk genes from different groups may share the same function.

expression profiles of mapks in response to various stress-related signals
to investigate the roles of mapk genes under various stress-related stimuli, we performed qrt-pcr to detect the differences in their expression abundance after exposure to three stress-related signaling compounds  or an oxidative stress inducer ). a total of  <dig> of the mapks were induced by at least one of four inducers, implying that mapks play important roles in signaling pathways. among these, ten were simultaneously induced and accumulated at higher levels after all four treatments; ten were induced by three inducers; one gene by two inducers and two genes by only one of the four inducers . for further details, expression pattern of individual gene under each treatment was showed in additional file 6: figure s <dig> figure  <dig>

mapk genes under stress-related signal treatments. the data are presented in clusters using the fold-change  of relative expression for all mapk genes in response to stress-siganl treatments , in comparison to their respective controls . red and blue colors represent increased or decreased expression levels, respectively, in comparison to controls. the stress-related signals included ja, h2o <dig>  aba and sa, respectively.



under ja conditions,  <dig> mapks were induced significantly. however, mapks from the four groups showed differently altered expression patterns. transcript levels of genes in group a and b and most in group c significantly increased, reaching a peak at 8 h after treatment, while those of mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  significantly increased and reached two peaks at 2 h and 4 h, respectively. the expression levels of the other mapk genes in group d significantly increased, quickly reaching a peak at different time points.

twenty one mapk genes were significantly upregulated after h2o <dig> treatment. in addition, mpk <dig> was induced, and its expression reached two peak values at  <dig> and 12 h, respectively. the other genes were significantly upregulated, reaching their highest levels at 10 h of treatment, including three genes in group a, five in group b, five in group c, and seven in group d. fifteen mapk genes, including three in group a, two in group b, four in group c, and six in group d, were significantly upregulated after aba treatment, with diverse expression patterns. finally, fifteen mapk genes were significantly upregulated after sa treatment. of these, six mapks were induced, including four in group a, one each in group c and d, with a peak observed at  <dig> or 8 h, while three genes each in group b, c, and d reached peak values at other time points.

expression profiles of mapks in response to abiotic stress
to investigate the roles of mapk genes under various abiotic stress conditions, we performed qrt-pcr to detect the differences in their expression after five stress treatments . as shown in figure  <dig>  the transcript levels of  <dig> mapk genes significantly increased after nacl treatment. in addition to mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  mapk genes in groups a, b and c were induced and accumulated at 4 h. all members of group d were also induced, but their expression patterns were diverse. the detailed information for expression pattern of individual genes under each treatment was showed in additional file 7: figure s <dig> figure  <dig> 
relative expression of
g. hirsutum
mapk genes under different stress treatments. the data are presented in clusters using the fold-change  of relative expression for all mapk genes in response to different treatments , in comparison to their respective controls . red and blue colors represent increased or decreased expression levels, respectively, in comparison to controls. the stressors included nacl, peg, 4°c, 37°c, and wounding treatment, respectively.



eleven mapk genes were significantly induced under drought treatment, including two in group b, four in group c, and five in group d. in addition,  <dig> mapk genes were induced and highly expressed after low temperature treatment , with diverse expression pattern. except for mpk <dig>  all of the mapk genes were induced and expressed at high levels. moreover,  <dig> mapk genes were induced and highly expressed upon exposure to high temperature conditions. of these, two genes each in groups b and c and five in group d were significantly upregulated and reached a peak at 10 h after treatment, while other twelve genes were induced and reached peak values at other time points. finally,  <dig> mapk genes were induced and upregulated when the seedling leaves were cut with scissors. of these, three in group a, five each in groups b and c, and eight in group d were significantly induced and reached peak values at different time points.

in total, the  <dig> detected mapk genes were widely induced by all types of abiotic stress . among these genes, eight were induced and expressed at higher levels under all five abiotic stress treatments. thirteen and two mapk genes were induced by four and three abiotic stresses, respectively. these expression patterns suggest that mapk genes carry out multiple physiological functions to help the plant adapt to various complex environmental challenges.table  <dig>

paralogs of mapks show diverse expression patterns
to investigate whether these duplicated paralog pairs were with the same expression patterns, we compared their expression profiles in different organs and under different stress treatments . in organs, only the correlation coefficient between mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> was greater than  <dig> , indicating a positive correlation and similar expression patterns between these two genes. however, other pairs had no clear positive or negative correlation. notably, the correlation coefficient between mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> was lower than − <dig> , suggesting distinctly different expression patterns between these two genes. comparison analysis indicated that paralogs of mapks from the same ancestor showed differential expression in different tissues and organs, implying that these genes evolved via gene duplication followed by expressional divergence.table  <dig>

furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that there were eight paralogs involved in stress-related signals and seven in abiotic stress with values greater than  <dig> , implying positively correlated expression between paralogs under stress. unlike mpk2-mpk <dig>  mpk14-mpk <dig> and mpk22-mpk <dig>  four paralogs, i.e., mpk8-mpk <dig>  mpk8-mpk <dig>  mpk9-mpk <dig> and mpk16-mpk <dig>  showed clear positive correlations under both stress-related signal and abiotic stress treatment, and other seven paralogs showed positive correlations under one or two stress conditions. taken together, these results suggest that mapks may have retained functional conservation after gene duplication to help plants cope with different stresses, acting as the main contributors to wide adaptation during the cotton evolutionary process.

potential functional roles of three mapk genes in verticillium dahliae resistance, as determined by trv-vigs
three mapks, including mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  were significantly induced after verticillium dahliae inoculation . the transcript levels of mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> significantly increased, with the highest peak observed at 24 h of treatment. mpk <dig> was significantly downregulated in response to inoculation after 24 h and 48 h, and its expression recovered to high levels at 96 h post-inoculation.figure  <dig>

virus-induced gene silencing  has been successfully used in cotton  <cit> . to further investigate the function of mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in v. dahliae resistance, we constructed recombinant viruses to silence endogenous genes in cotton, producing constructs trv2:mpk <dig>  trv2:mpk <dig> and trv2:mpk <dig>  with trv1-trv <dig> for the mock treatment. to validate the reliability of vigs in cotton, we silenced an indicator gene, cla <dig> , producing plants with a photobleached phenotype. at least  <dig> plants were infiltrated per construct at 8 days post-emergence, and untreated plants were grown in the same environment without syringe treatment. two weeks later, all treated individuals infiltrated with trv2-cla <dig> showed highly uniform bleaching in newly emerged leaves . real-time quantitative pcr confirmed that untreated and mock-treated plants showed the same and high expression levels of mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  however, the transcripts of these three genes exhibited strong silencing in infiltrated trv2:mpk <dig>  trv2:mpk <dig> and trv2: mpk <dig> plants .

we inoculated cotton seedlings using dip-infection with liquid containing 1 × 107 
v. dahliae spores. two weeks later, spontaneous lesions in stems and yellow leaf veins were found in target gene-silenced plants. four weeks later, the true leaves of diseased plants exhibited wilting . in general, the control plants seldom exhibited leaf wilting, with average diseased leaf: healthy leaf ratios of approximately 30%. however,  <dig> % of the mpk9-silenced plants were severely infected by v. dahlia, which was similar to the results observed in susceptible control plants . furthermore,  <dig> % of the mpk13-silenced plants showed a severe wilting phenotype, and 54% of the mpk25-silenced plants exhibited wilting symptoms on leaves when infected with v. dahlia . these results demonstrate that silencing of mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> compromises the resistance of cotton to this pathogen, and gene-silenced plants exhibited more wilting and etiolated leaves than the vector control plants with p <  <dig>  significance. in summary, mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> are important components of resistance to v. dahlia infection in cotton.figure  <dig>

discussion
characterization of mapks in g. raimondii and evolution of mapk genes
based on the genome scans of several plant genomes, mapk family genes have been systematically investigated in arabidopsis  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . in the current study, a total of  <dig> mapks from g. raimondii were identified. these mapks were classified into four groups  according to their phylogenetic clades, which were similar to those reported in arabidopsis and o. sativa  <cit> . we also found that all mapk proteins contain  <dig> domains , and tey or tdy motifs of mapks are located in the activation loop between kinase subdomain vii and viii, as described previously  <cit> . the subgroup of a, b and c possesses a thr-glu-tyr  domain and a short c-terminus containing a common docking  domain that consists of the sequencedxxepxc, whereas those of subgroup d possess a thr-asp-tyr activation domain, without the cd domain but with a relatively long c-terminal region, which is also consistent with previous reports  <cit> . previous studies, such as reports in arabidopsis, tobacco, tomato and rice, focused on tey mapks  <cit> . interestingly, arabidopsis, g. max and g. raimondii contain more mapks with the tey phosphorylation site than the tdy motif. by contrast, the o. sativa genome contains more mapks with the tdy phosphorylation site than the tey motif. we propose that in dicot plants, mapks with the tey motif play more important roles than mapks with the tdy motif.

phylogenetic analysis between cotton and other plants revealed that grmapks in a, b and c might come from the same ancestor, while d mpak genes might be paralogous products. the distribution of grmpaks is nonrandom, which is similar to the result of a previous study  <cit> . based on phylogenetic tree analysis, we found that a large number of mapks belong to subgroup d, which is similar to reports in arabidopsis, rice and poplar  <cit> . these results support the previous suggestion that subgroup d expanded before and after the monocot/dicot split  <cit> . comparison of exon-intron structures indicated that the a, b and c groups share a similar number of exons and the lengths of exons are more conserved than those of introns. however, members in the d group have more exons and the lengths of these exons and introns are diverse. synteny analysis of the g. raimondii genome indicated that the mapk family mainly resulted from segmental duplication.

expression patterns of mapks imply their functional divergence during plant development and growth
previous studies have demonstrated that some mapk genes exhibit tissue specificity in various plants such as arabidopsis, tobacco, poplar, brachypodium distachyon, wheat and brassica  <cit> . rsmpk <dig> was detected in vegetative and reproductive organs, with different expression patterns  <cit> . tamapk <dig> is expressed in all tissue, but tampk <dig> is only expressed at low levels in flowers  <cit> .

in the current study, we observed differential expression patterns of mapks in vegetative organs  and reproductive organs . five genes were constitutively expressed at high levels in both vegetative and reproductive organs. two genes were expressed at higher levels in vegetative organs, and the remaining genes were expressed at higher levels in reproductive organs. a recent study demonstrated that atmpk <dig> plays an important role in meiotic cytokinesis during pollen development  <cit> . psmpk <dig> is involved in fruit set, which is activated by gibberellins and cytokinins  <cit> . slmpk <dig> is expressed at markedly high levels in stamens  <cit> . the tissue- or organ-specific mapk expression patterns observed in the current study indicate their functional divergence during plant development and growth. interestingly, four mapk genes, mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  mpk <dig>  and mpk <dig> in group a and mpk <dig> in group c with higher expression in almost all tested tissues were worth to be further studied for actual function.

varied expression of mapks in response to stress-related signals and abiotic stressors
abiotic and biotic stresses such as cold, drought and pathogens seriously affect cotton growth and yield, and studies have focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying the response to these stresses in cotton. to date, an increasing number of studies have shown that mapks can regulate plant development, growth and responses to abiotic/biotic stress. in cotton, ghmpk <dig> and gbmpk <dig> are upregulated by diverse abiotic stresses and likely play a role in drought and oxidative stress tolerance  <cit> . ghmpk <dig> plays an important role in aba-induced cat <dig> expression and h2o <dig> production  <cit> , whereas ghmpk6a negatively regulates responses to osmotic stress and bacterial infection  <cit> . ghmpk <dig> and ghmpk <dig> are involved in plant defense responses and the regulation of certain components of multiple stress-signaling pathways  <cit> . extensive studies have revealed that mapks are not only involved in abiotic stress and biotic responses but also in plant development and hormonal signaling. vlot and coworkers  suggested that sa can regulate responses to biotrophic pathogens and systemic acquired resistance, while ja mediates responses to necrotrophs  <cit> . recent studies have shown that aba is involved in salinity and drought responses  <cit> . h2o <dig> can induce oxidative bursts or the accumulation of reactive oxygen species  in plant cells. ros may contribute to resistance by directly killing the invading pathogen or activating cell wall crosslinking and lignification and subsequently strengthening the cell wall to help confine pathogen infection  <cit> .

systematic analyses of the expression patterns of mapk genes under stress-related signal treatment showed that ten of  <dig>  mapk genes were induced by four inducers. ten  and one  of these genes were induced by three and two inducers, respectively. two  genes were induced by only one of the four inducers. accumulating evidence has shown that systemic defense responses in plants are controlled by the mutually antagonistic hormones ja and sa. our data indicate that all mapk genes were induced under ja treatment, with  <dig> were simultaneously induced by sa. this finding implies that these genes are coregulated by ja and sa and highlights the notion that mapk genes might play key roles in plant defense responses. furthermore, the gene expression patterns under abiotic stress show that eight of  <dig>  mapk genes were upregulated by five abiotic stressors. thirteen  and two  were upregulated by four or three stressors, respectively. the present results further demonstrate that mapks are involved in the response to environmental stress in cotton.

previous reports have shown that each hormone signaling pathway contributes to an interactive network that coordinates responses to different stresses  <cit> . in addition, abiotic stress-regulated genes act either in an aba-dependent or aba-independent manner, sa can regulate responses to biotrophic pathogens and systemic acquired resistance. here, among  <dig> aba-regulated mapk genes,  <dig> were also regulated by sa. further, our data indicate that eight mapk genes were upregulated by five stressors and also induced by ja and h2o <dig>  among these, five genes were simultaneously induced by four stress-related signals. the widespread induction of mapk genes in response to diverse stressors and hormones suggests that mapk genes play a significant role in hormone signaling pathways during stress tolerance.

gene duplication is followed by functional diversification. a comparison of the expression patterns of paralogous genes demonstrated that most, but not all, of these genes showed similar responses towards various hormone and abiotic treatments. for instance, mpk9-mpk <dig>  mpk16-mpk <dig>  mpk8-mpk <dig> and mpk8-mpk <dig> paralogs showed similar responses to both hormone and abiotic treatments. the paralogs mpk5-mpk <dig>  mpk8-mpk <dig>  mpk10-mpk <dig> and mpk10-mpk <dig> showed similar expression patterns in response to hormones, and the paralogs mpk8-mpk <dig>  mpk20-mpk <dig> and mpk20-mpk <dig> showed similar expression patterns in response to abiotic stresses. our results suggest that these pairs of mapks share similar functions under abiotic and/or hormone treatment, respectively. an examination of the overall transcription patterns suggests that gene duplication resulted in partially overlapping functions; the redundant functions of mapk genes may be beneficial for protecting the cell from various stress conditions. on the other hand, paralogs of mapk genes also showed an interesting pattern of functional divergence in different organs and tissues, implying that mapk genes may play a crucial role in driving evolutionary novelty and adaptation to new environments.

mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> are required for resistance against verticillium dahliae in cotton
gene expression patterns are usually an indicator of gene functions. in the current study, we found that mapk genes were generally responsive to biotic and abiotic stress treatments, suggesting that they play important roles in responses to environmental stress and pathogens. verticillium wilt is a serious disease that significantly affects the yield and quality of cotton.

accumulating evidence demonstrates that the mapk cascade plays an important role in the regulation of pathogen-induced defenses. atmpk3/atmpk <dig> are activated by pathogens and regulate the pathogen defense response pathway, and atmpk3/atmpk <dig> are involved in abiotic stress response  and hormone signal pathways  <cit> . osmpk <dig> is also induced by abiotic stresses, pathogen infection and aba treatment  <cit> . in cotton, ghmpk6a, ghmpk <dig> and ghmpk <dig> are involved in the pathogen-resistance response  <cit> . here, we found that mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> were significantly upregulated in cotton roots after inoculation with v. dahliae, and these three genes were upregulated in leaves after exposure to ja, h2o <dig>  aba and sa. we speculate that mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> are involved in regulating the pathogen response. using vigs technology  <cit> , we further investigated the function of mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> in v. dahliae resistance. statistical analysis showed that silencing of whether mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> or mpk <dig> by vigs increased significantly the susceptibility of cotton to v. dahliae. compared with the two other genes, plants harboring a silenced mpk <dig> gene were more severely infected by v. dahlia, implying that mpk <dig> plays an important role in v. dahlia resistance in cotton.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> grmapks were identified based on the genome sequence of g. raimondii, and  <dig> cdna sequences of mapks with complete orfs were cloned from g. hirsutum. phylogenetic tree and motif analysis showed that grmapks could be classified into four groups, comparable to those in arabidopsis, o. sativa and g. max. most mapks showed different temporal and spatial expression patterns in vegetative and reproductive organs, and crosstalk occurred under biotic/abiotic stress and stress-related signal treatment. vigs analysis indicated that mpk <dig>  mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> are important components in cotton resistance to v. dahliae infection. our work provides a reference for systematically elucidating the important roles of mapks in cotton growth, development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses and for effectively utilizing mapks in cotton stress tolerance breeding.
