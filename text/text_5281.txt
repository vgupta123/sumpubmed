BACKGROUND
citrus trees are susceptible to a number of diseases with different degrees of economic impact. one of the most severe in terms of economic losses is citrus canker disease  caused by xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, . xcc is a biotrophic bacterial phytopathogen that belongs to the genus xanthomonas of the Î±-subdivision v within proteobacteria. susceptibility to citrus canker disease varies among citrus types and relatives, but most of the commercially grown citrus types are susceptible hosts to xcc  <cit> . disease symptoms include canker lesions on the green aerial parts of the plant as well as fruit; infections can result in both foliar and fruit abscission, thereby decreasing the productivity of affected trees. in addition there can be reduced profitability as a result of blemished fruit that can be harvested but not sold in the fresh market.

plants have evolved multiple defence mechanisms to survive pathogen attacks  <cit> . the first branch of the indispensable plant innate immunity system is triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns  such as the lipopolysaccharides , peptidoglycan and bacterial flagellin, as well as the chitin and glucan from fungi. the second branch utilizes the nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat  encoded by r  genes named the effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . the xanthomonas spp. phytobacterial pathogens have evolved unique pathogenesis mechanisms to avoid host recognition and suppress host defences  <cit> . bacterial effector proteins are delivered via the bacterial type iii secretion system  into the plant cell to evade recognition by the different plant surveillance systems  <cit> . these effectors in general contribute to host resistance or susceptibility as well as to modifying host responses. a fundamental element of the eti in resistant plants is a localized cell collapse or a hypersensitive response  at infection sites in an attempt to restrict the growth of the pathogen  <cit> . this is a common feature of disease resistant responses in incompatible plant-pathogen, and occasionally some non-host, interactions  <cit> . some of the xanthomonas spp. effector proteins, for instance ptha/avrbs <dig>  are essential to elicit citrus canker symptoms and if expressed by itself inside host cells, ptha is sufficient to cause symptoms of citrus canker disease  <cit> . in the meantime however, other recent studies show that other types of proteins are injected through the xcc ttss and do not necessarily alter the physiological and transcriptional responses to the pathogen in citrus  <cit> .

while certain genes involved in systemic acquired resistance  have been characterized and used as markers for studying plant defence mechanisms  <cit> , crosstalk between signals and hormone pathways has also been proposed  <cit> . consequently, plant resistance is correlated with the activation of a complex network of defence pathways and the response of the host plant to a microbial assault is therefore expected to result in drastic changes in the patterns of gene expression throughout the plant  <cit> .

kumquats , close relatives to citrus species, are reported to have high levels of field resistance to citrus canker  <cit> . previously, we have shown a sharply contrasting phenotype in grapefruit and kumquat when both plants were challenged with a high concentration of xccr   <cit> . grapefruit , considered to be highly susceptible to the bacterium, showed the characteristic sequence of canker lesion development. initially lesions appeared as water soaking, followed by the development of a raised corky form; each such lesion is a reservoir of new bacterial inoculum. bacterial exudates were visible between  <dig> and  <dig> days post-inoculation. in contrast, pcd was observed in kumquat leaves in the form of a hr 3- <dig> days after inoculation with the canker-causing bacterium. only necrotic lesions were observed and the bacterial population over time was shown to have an 'avirulent' incompatible growth pattern where bacterial multiplication ceased upon the development of necrosis  <cit> .

new tools have been developed in recent years through advances in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics that have particular utility for examining pathogen: host interaction complexities  <cit> . the purpose of this study was to examine simultaneous changes in expression profiles for genes differentially expressed in the early stages  of citrus canker infection in kumquat, particularly those previously implicated in pcd-related responses such as hr.

RESULTS
in this study, identification of differentially expressed kumquat genes during its interaction with xcc was pursued in an attempt to unravel the nature of the resistance mechanism employed by the plant. previously, kumquat suppression subtractive hybridization  cdna libraries were constructed from xcc-inoculated vs. mock inoculated leaves  <cit> . since ssh allows differential amplification of rare target sequences due to the elimination of more abundant house-keeping cdna transcripts found in common from both samples, the technique has the potential of uncovering pertinent cdna sequences. subtraction was done in both directions, forward  and reverse  and the resulting cdnas were subsequently sequenced. preliminary screening macroarrays were used to confirm enrichment of the subtracted libraries with differentially expressed genes .

microarray experimental design
kumquat microarray chip hybridization data were assessed for overall signal intensity and consistency of the expression ratio over all time points, which resulted in the exclusion of chips with inconsistent results. figure  <dig> is a scatter plot showing m-values from two different biological replicate-hybridizations with xcc-inducible targets  and mock inoculated non-infected targets  confirming high data consistency levels .

functional annotation and an overview of global gene expression
the b2go program  <cit>  was used to assign go  terms for hits obtained through eblast homology searches in ncbi. a general view of the similarity of the query set with the ncbi database, the distribution of the cut off for the e-value as well as the distribution of species with similar sequences are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the go annotation score is considered to be more intuitive than regular blast e-values since go annotation is carried out by applying an annotation rule  on the ontology terms. additionally, query sequence descriptions are obtained by applying a language processing algorithm that extracts informative names and avoids low-content terms such as "hypothetical protein" or "expressed protein". using blast2go suite default parameters,  <dig> probes were provided with go annotations . approximately 25% of the transcripts on the array do not show similarity to proteins present in public databases. some of these could represent exclusive genes of the citrus or kumquat lineages, but a fraction of these uncharacterized sequences may possibly represent low quality or 3'utr sequences. similar percentages of unknown sequences have been reported in other small-scale est projects  <cit>  and therefore this pattern can be considered characteristic of this approach. since a citrus genome sequence is now available, future studies will have a wealth of citrus genomic sequence information that can be utilized to identify kumquat-specific as well as novel citrus genes involved in diverse defence mechanisms  <cit> .

gene ontology analysis provided an extremely informative snapshot of the xcc/kumquat interaction. the hierarchical structure for the gene ontology of a group of sequences can be visualized as a tree by means of directed acyclic graphs   <cit> . for instance, the molecular functions of the network implicated in the kumquat response to xcc infection is illustrated in the dag presented in figure  <dig>  the graph demonstrates a tree controlled by the seq filter that organizes the number of nodes to be displayed. seq is the number of different sequences annotated at the child go term. on the whole, the biological meaning for different sequences in the data set was best illustrated in terms of three go gene categories; the biological processes  underlying molecular functions , and the cellular compartments where proteins were localized .

kumquat transcriptional changes in response to xcc infection
an important aspect of the data was that, for many genes, transcript abundance varied over time points, and a number of genes were only up- or down-regulated at one or two time points . two approaches were used to identify patterns of gene expression. first; the asca-gene analysis methodology revealed that most of the total variability in the data was related to time-associated changes  <cit> . according to asca,  <dig> probes were selected as differentially expressed,  <dig> of which were at statistically significant levels . moreover, the time-associated variation could be divided into two main variability patterns. one pattern  represented genes whose expression levels changed significantly at  <dig> hpi from their levels at  <dig> hpi and then recovered to values similar to the starting values  at  <dig> hpi. however, the major pattern  indicated a strong gene expression change between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi followed by preservation of expression levels at  <dig> hpi. this indicates that the strongest response to infection occurred at  <dig> to  <dig> hpi, and the majority of genes maintained their change for up to  <dig> days with a smaller percentage reverting to initial values.

the second approach, masigpro analysis, indicated that  <dig> probes were differentially expressed throughout time, . the results of both approaches were combined into  <dig> probes that were then filtered using more stringent conditions to provide a unique result. the union rather than the intersection of the two approaches was taken because the two methods reveal different aspects of the data and are thus complementary. the asca-gene methodology focuses on shared gene expression changes to find important genes, while masigpro treats genes independently and evaluates significant time dependent-changes. although asca-gene methodology may miss some genes whose expression pattern is rare but significant, these will be captured by the gene-wise masigpro approach. alternatively, masigpro can miss genes with less pronounced changes, which can be recovered by asca-gene if their profile is abundant within the dataset. the use of both approaches together resulted in the identification of  <dig> differentially expressed genes  <dig> of which with acceptable p-values that could be divided into  <dig> clusters according to their expression patterns . the criterion for this division is as follows. from the asca analysis we obtained the main patterns of variation: cluster pattern a indicates a strong change in expression between  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, which is then maintained at time  <dig> hpi. cluster b pattern is comprised of genes differentially expressed at  <dig> hpi as compared to either  <dig> hpi or  <dig> hpi. for each pattern, the correlation of the mean value of each gene at each time point with the profiles indicated by asca-gene was calculated; subsequently genes were divided into  <dig> clusters depending on whether expression levels changed in positive or negative directions. in this analysis, genes cannot be classified simply as induced or repressed, because this depends on the time points considered; for example, genes in cluster pattern c are repressed at  <dig> hpi and then induced at  <dig> hpi.

functional categorization of transcripts underlines key elements in kumquat response to xcc infection
based on the assumption that altered gene profiles during plant-microbe interactions can be correlated with symptoms, gene ontology and annotation, we believe that xcc represents a typical example of how the bacterial pathogen can manipulate the host systems in its favour as elucidated previously in different studies  <cit> . information on all of the specific transcripts discussed in the subsequent paragraphs is given in table  <dig>  cernadas et al. inoculated 'pera' sweet orange with either xcc, which causes typical canker symptoms on this citrus type, or xanthomonas axonopodis pv. aurantifolii pathotype c , which only produces symptoms on mexican lime, followed by a detailed transcriptional analysis for the sweet orange plants  <cit> . although the analyses done in that study cannot be directly compared with our study because of differences in methodology, some generalizations are noted below.

while other sequences that might not be mentioned in the text but show interesting gene expression profiles.

the distribution of functions within the significantly expressed genes in xcc infected kumquats indicates that the highest number of transcripts  was associated with response to stress, electron transport, and/or oxidative stress , an indication of an early regulatory changes in the plant immune system by xcc. earlier studies, such as that of cernadas et al., have come to the same perception  <cit> . each identified cluster was subjected to functional analysis by either studying the distribution of go terms or performing enrichment analysis to see if there were functional categories that were significantly represented. a total of  <dig> genes, which makes up more than 30% of the genes that were significantly expressed, were down-regulated in the interval between  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi,. most of them were grouped in clusters a and c . the expression levels of the genes in both of these clusters reached a minimal expression level at  <dig> hpi followed by either a minor  or major  recovery by  <dig> hpi . for instance, the expression of the thioredoxin f gene homologue  that belongs to cluster a reached its maximum level of expression  by  <dig> hpi after slight decrease at  <dig> hpi.the lipoxygenase gene homologue  that belongs to cluster c was  <dig>  fold down-regulated at  <dig> hpi followed by a  <dig> fold increase in expression when compared to the its expression level at  <dig> hpi sample. genes in cluster a and c were frequently related to oxidative stress response. most of the activity for genes in these clusters is located in the mitochondria, the cell membrane and the chloroplast . cluster b was the largest cluster and included  <dig> genes with up-regulated expression levels between  <dig> hpi to  <dig> hpi followed by sustained expression until  <dig> hpi . cluster d contained  <dig> members that had a low steady expression up to  <dig> hpi, and were subsequently upregulated . this cluster includes genes, such as the glycosyltransferase-like gene , that mediate the transfer of glycosyl residues from activated nucleotide sugars to acceptor molecules , a key mechanism in determining the diversity, activity and chemical complexity of plant natural products. in plants, ugts  generally use udp-glucose and occasionally udp-xylose for glucosylation of phenylpropanoid aglycones. albrecht and bowman  <cit>  proposed using ugts and other glycosyltransferases as prospective genetic engineering candidates due to their important role in resistance and tolerance to citrus tristeza virus  as well as citrus huanglongbing  in trifoliate oranges . phenolics are mainly synthesized in plants via the phenylpropanoid pathway and are incorporated into many important compounds including plant hormones, secondary metabolites involved in stress, defence responses, and xenobiotics such as herbicides  <cit> . in addition, phenylpropanoid pathway intermediates, for example p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid, and pathway derivatives, including flavonoid aglycones and glycosides, exhibit antimicrobial activity  <cit> .

kumquat transcriptional changes in response to xcc infection
ros vs ros scavenging
in order to maintain homeostasis and overcome the damaging effects of ros , a balance between sods  and the different h2o2-scavenging enzymes is considered to be critical in determining the levels of o2- and h2o <dig> in plant cells  <cit> . accordingly, there is a constant interplay between the antioxidant state and processes generating ros. ros are produced in chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria in response to biotic as well as abiotic stresses  <cit> . accordingly, the expression of different enzymes that produce ros were evidently stringently controlled and coordinated during the kumquat/xcc interaction. for instance, while formate dehydrogenase , a mitochondrial nad dependent enzyme, was  <dig>  fold upregulated by  <dig> hpi, amine oxidase  that contributes to the synthesis of h2o <dig> and secondary metabolites was downregulated by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi respectively in response to xcc challenge . concurrently, xcc-inoculated kumquat plants overexpressed genes related to ros scavenging to restrict damage to the inoculated parts of the plant, in this case the leaves. for instance, cuznsod  expression in kumquats was increased ~ <dig>  fold at  <dig> hpi and was stabilized at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> dpi . the same phenomenon was observed previously in tomato infected with botrytis cinerea, a sign of increased ros production by the host as part of the defence response to infection  <cit> . furthermore, while the expression of some of the genes linked to protease inhibitors and endopeptidase activities such as protease inhibitor homologue  was suppressed by the bacteria, other serine-type endopeptidase inhibitors such as an atp-dependent ion protease  was > <dig> fold up-regulated as early as  <dig> hpi subsequent to xcc inoculation. in the same context, the redox coupling ascorbate-glutathione cycle, known to be responsible for peroxide detoxification  <cit> , was repressed by  <dig> hpi in the kumquat dataset; examples include dehydroascorbate reductase  and glutathione peroxidase . ascorbate and glutathione are non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules that have a role in other cycles, including those that synthesize and in some cases modulate flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, Î±-tocopherol and carotenoids, all of which contribute in scavenging ros  <cit> . dehydroascorbate reductase activity is indispensible when the ascorbate peroxidase  levels are higher than normal under certain conditions to ensure preservation of the reduced form of ascorbate. both proteins in addition to certain types of trypsin inhibitors might also catalyze a plant response  <cit> . a similar study to investigate the xanthomonas-grapefruit compatible interaction might present a platform to compare gene expression profiles of some genes of interest in both plants.

accumulating evidence indicates that protein ubiquitination and degradation, last steps in protein turnover, are involved in plant defence responses. a number of recent studies have investigated a possible role of u-box e <dig> ubiquitin ligases in pti , eti , as well as plant cell death and defence  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> ubiquitination pathway-related genes, for example ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ucb <dig> , were isolated in the kumquat forward subtracted libraries; more investigation of their expression levels after infection will follow. other induced genes that are involved in the proteolysis process are present in clusters a, b and c.

genes involved in photosynthesis
a distinct down-regulation in the expression of ribulose <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase at  <dig> hpi, followed by an increase in expression that reaches maximum expression at  <dig> hpi, was observed in the microarray dataset  . rubisco, the most abundant protein in leaves, is the main source of energy production in plant cells. a decrease in photosynthesis was previously shown in arabidopsis leaves as early as  <dig> h after challenge with the p. syringae avirulent strain, while after  <dig> h the rate of photosynthesis was lower with the virulent strain  <cit> . most of the photosynthetic machinery in challenged kumquat leaves was repressed at  <dig> hpi, including chlorophyll a/b binding protein . three photosynthesis-related genes were differentially down-regulated during the first  <dig> hours. in pto-mediated resistance,  <dig> photosynthesis-related genes and  <dig> genes encoding chloroplast-associated proteins were suppressed  <cit> . these results show that plants reduce photosynthetic potential to induce hr following pathogen attack. further, quirino et al.  <cit>  suggested that hr and senescence are two programs that involve biochemical similarities as well as an overlap. the research reinforced the idea of a connection between defence response and senescence. evidently, the down-regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis during the xcc/kumquat interaction represents a cost for the plant fitness where energy resources were redirected to defence response.

cell wall remodelling
xcc inoculation of kumquat was followed by the down-regulation of various genes related to cell wall remodeling and rapid expansion such as endoglucanases. the expression level of a kumquat homologue of this wall loosening protein  was insignificant. on the other hand, genes related to cell wall reorganization, for example xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase , were significantly up-regulated by  <dig> hpi . in 'pera' sweet orange, a major difference in the response to inoculation of the two bacterial strains was that xcc strongly upregulated several cell wall remodelling enzymes, while xaa upregulated genes related to endoglucanase inhitors and lignin biosynthesis. a phenomenon that we observed in kumquat plants is the development of a few minute necrotic flecks on the leaves when inoculated with low concentrations of the bacterium . neither leaf abscission nor water soaked lesions were observed on the leaves later under our conditions. it is also worth mentioning that although cernadas et al. used a relatively high concentration of xaa  only pustles were recorded in sweet orange inoculated with xaa that were not followed by necrosis  <cit> . using light microscopy, we have previously shown mesophyl collapse in kumquat leaves which was followed by leaf abscission  <dig> hrs post inoculation with xcc. alternatively, grapefruit mesophyl cells from inoculated leaves showed enlargement  and division  followed by raised circular lesions that became raised and developed into white or yellow spongy pustules. these pustules then darkened and thickened into brown corky canker lesions  <cit> . pustule formation and hypertrophy were linked previously to the ptha effector in nicotiana benthamiana  <cit> . alternatively, accumulation of the tomato xth  protein  <dig> hours after attachment of the parasite has provided evidence for a role of xth in defence reactions associated with the incompatible tomato-cuscuta interaction as was presented in albert et al.  <cit> .

resistance genes and related proteins
most of the differentially expressed genes in the kumquat/xcc interaction have also been identified in plant-insect interactions  <cit> , non-host resistance  <cit>  and r-gene mediated resistance  <cit> , suggesting a high level of convergence between different types of resistance mechanisms. the expression levels of some homologues to the pr <dig>   and Ã-galactosidase   genes were found to be modestly activated;  <dig> and  <dig> fold up-regulated respectively  <dig> hpi, although both genes were down-regulated by  <dig> hpi as shown by the microarray and the qrt-pcr  data . chitinase expression is a plant defence strategy typically used against wall components of fungi and insects  <cit> . according to the qrt-pcr, the kumquat chitinase gene was >2-fold up-regulated by  <dig> hpi, after which it was suppressed at  <dig> hpi, and then its expression increased. other studies have also reported the induction of chitinases in response to bacterial pathogens but their function is not well known  <cit> .

interestingly, the expression levels of the kumquat pr <dig>  gene homologue, normally a marker of salicylic acid-induced systemic acquired resistance  that is usually up-regulated after pathogen infections, was lower in the infected samples as early as  <dig> hpi compared to control mock inoculated samples  . the region upstream of the pr <dig> promoter, w-box sequences, was shown previously to act as a negative cis-acting element in the expression of defence related genes  <cit> . this implies a different basal defence response and sar regulation mechanism from that of arabidopsis and other dicotyledonous plants in kumquat after xcc infection. pr genes that were identified in citrus vary in their responses to different pathogens as shown in this study and others where variation in expression levels of different members of the pr gene family was dependent on the nature of different elicitors  <cit> . the biological activity of a large majority of pr genes in plants during biotic stress is yet to be revealed. more interestingly, according to the microarray results, expression levels of a number of homologues to other defence related genes such as the ndr <dig> gene  were also repressed  <dig> hpi after xcc infection.

lrr proteins are known to be a part of the early signal transduction cascade involved in the recognition of pathogen avr products  <cit> . sequences for a number of homologues known to be part of different hormonal defence pathways  were found to be differentially expressed in kumquat after xcc inoculation.

key molecular features of kumquat pcd
a number of genes homologous to known resistant response-specific genes were expressed in the kumquat transcriptome concurrently following xcc inoculation, listed and discussed below:

 kslfi3-c <dig> is homologous to hsr203j , a carboxylesterase  gene implicated previously in the incompatible interactions between tobacco and the bacterial pathogen ralstonia solanacearum. its promoter is highly, rapidly, and specifically activated in response to hr inducing bacterial inoculation, does not respond to various stress conditions, and is strongly dependent on hrp  genes of the pathogenic bacterium  <cit> . it has been proposed that its expression should be a useful marker for programmed cell death occurring in response to diverse pathogens.

 kllri2-b <dig> shares homology with dnd <dig> , which encodes a cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel that allows passage of ca2+, k+ and other cations. the arabidopsis thaliana dnd <dig> mutant failed to produce hr cell death in response to an avirulent pathogen infection  <cit> .

 during programmed cell death or apoptosis cytochrome c is released to the cytoplasm from the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion  <cit> . once in the cytoplasm, it activates caspases , killer proteins that dismantle the cell  <cit> . two key proteins known to be core components of the apoptic machinery in animals, caspase and bax-inhibitor <dig> gene homologues, were identified in our dataset. according to our data, a homologue that has caspase activity kllri2_a <dig> was slightly up-regulated by  <dig> hpi in kumquat challenged leaves. bax is a member of the bcl <dig> family that plays a regulatory role preventing apoptosis by inhibiting adapters needed for the activation of caspases  <cit> . a kumquat homologue of the bax-inhibitor <dig> gene  was shown to be slightly up regulated  <dig> hpi in response to xcc challenge as was previously shown with arabidopsis thaliana bax inhibitor- <dig> , isolated during a differential screen of plants challenged with the phytopathogen pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . in the same context, bax inhibitor has been shown to trigger cytochrome c release from mitochondria both in vitro and in vivo in animals.

 endopeptidase inhibitors are often part of an inducible, jasmonic acid associated defence pathway that accumulates upon wounding, pathogen, or herbivore damage in leaves  <cit> . the antagonistic interaction between proteases and endopeptidase inhibitors is considered to be a cell death control mechanism  <cit> . li et al.,  <dig> demonstrated that a serine protease  inhibitor  of arabidopsis is involved in modulating pcd in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . rnai silencing of the atkti <dig> gene resulted in enhanced lesion development after infiltration of leaf tissue with the pcd-eliciting fungal toxin fumonisin b <dig>  or the avirulent bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc <dig> carrying avrb . trypsin inhibitor  and a miraculin serine type endopeptidase inhibitor  sequences were found in original early subtraction libraries representing transcripts expressed during early infection . while kllfiii3-f <dig>  gene expression was significantly suppressed  <dig> hpi, the expression of ksliii1-h <dig> was slightly suppressed and then  <dig> fold upregulated  <dig> hpi. further analysis should be done to study the difference between the mechanism of action of these two genes.

suppression of defence responses
a very evident down-regulation of a considerable number of genes was recorded by  <dig> hpi which may be caused by defence suppression imposed by xcc effectors . it has been shown previously that xcc exploits the type iii secretion system  to inject different effector proteins into citrus plants in order to avoid host recognition and subsequently mamps/pamp-triggered immunity. the bacterial effector proteins suppress plant defences including basal defence, gene-for-gene resistance, and nonhost resistance. there was no accumulation of any sar gene transcripts including pr <dig>  a marker for enhanced defence; in addition some other key elements in the sa defence pathway were suppressed. on the other hand, the s-adenosyl-l-methionine:benzoic acid salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase gene  was at least 1-fold upregulated in kumquat leaves by  <dig> hpi in response to xcc inoculation; the gene is known to play a role in plant defence responses  <cit> . in addition, the sa-binding protein  <dig> , a lipase protein that belongs to the hydrolase super family, was found to be up-regulated at  <dig> hpi by at least  <dig> fold; the gene was previously found to be required for the plant immune response in tobacco  <cit> .

realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction validation
validation of the presented microarray dataset was carried out using taqman gene expression assay for a number of homologues on the array. genes that were implicated in plant defence including basic leucine zipper transcription factor , a putative chitinase protein , a putative disease resistance leucine rich protein , a receptor like protein kinase , a beta galactosidase like protein  and a putative mitogen-activated protein  were selected for validation using q rt-pcr. as summarized in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the qrt-pcr data correlated with the microarray results confirming the up-or down-regulation of all analyzed genes although as expected the qrt-pcr was more sensitive.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a f. margarita custom microarray representing  <dig> unigenes was used to study the response to inoculation with x. axonopodis pv. citri. a very distinct though delayed hr was observed in xcc-inoculated kumquat plants where initially the bacterium grew exponentially, followed by a sudden leaf tissue collapse  2- <dig> days after inoculation  <cit> . a comparable delayed hr was observed in tomato resistance response to race t <dig> mediated by avrxv <dig> effector and rxvt <dig> r protein  <cit> . the current kumquat analysis allowed simultaneous investigation of the expression of more than one group of genes known to be linked to more than one biological process and cellular compartment in relation to the hr caused by xcc infection. a large number of genes were found to be differentially expressed after infection. most of the genes involved in defence mechanisms in kumquat appear to be associated with the phenomena that precede the hr including oxidative burst, protein degradation, and regulation of photosynthesis as well as the production of ros that is associated with the oxidative burst. one very distinct observation was that some of the defence genes such as pr <dig> and ndr <dig> were down-regulated in kumquats in response to xcc inoculation as early as  <dig> hpi, a phenomenon currently under further examination. what clearly appears to be a resistant response and a drastic decrease in the bacterial population, in addition to the activation of genes involved in ros production as well as and programmed cell death, seems to be a common mechanism that is pursued by more than one citrus bacterial pathogen with no associated-resistance genes yet identified  <cit> . future work will compare differences in gene response in both resistant and susceptible citrus types.
