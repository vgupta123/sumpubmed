BACKGROUND
fruit ripening is a genetically regulated process that involves numerous metabolic changes in colour, flavour, texture and aroma; these changes are controlled by endogenous hormonal and genetic regulators and external signals   <cit> . this process has been stimulated using tomato as an excellent model of fleshy fruit development and ripening; tomato has been utilised as an excellent model because of several advantages, including well-characterised ripening mutants, small genome size, high-density genetic maps, short life cycle, efficient transient and stable transformation and complete genome sequence  <cit> .

on the basis of the induction of respiration and ethylene at the onset of ripening, scholars categorised tomato as a climacteric fruit. ripening in climacteric fruits can also be initiated by exposure to exogenous ethylene. grierson  <cit>  reviewed that ethylene induces ripening in climacteric fruits by using tomato as a model. antisense genes are used to suppress the expression of aco <dig> and acs <dig>  which respectively encode 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  oxidase  and acc synthase ; aco and acs are the major enzymes involved in ethylene biosynthesis. acs is encoded in tomato by a multi-gene family with at least eight members and three other putative genes in the genome sequence  <cit> . aco is encoded in tomato by a multi-gene family of at least four characterised acos and three other putative genes in the genome sequence  <cit> . previous studies also characterised the effect of ethylene on gene expression during climacteric ripening  <cit> . ethylene induces the expressions of acs <dig> and acs <dig>  which are important in tomato fruit ripening  <cit> . the upregulation of acs1a and acs <dig> at ripening initiation produces ethylene, which induces acs <dig> and acs <dig> to mediate autocatalytic ethylene synthesis, a process typically observed in climacteric ripening. acs <dig> and aco <dig> control ethylene production in tomato fruits  <cit> .

the plant hormone abscisic acid  not only regulates seed dormancy, plant growth and development, and responses to environmental stresses  <cit>  but also displays a pattern of change similar to ethylene at late stages of fruit development  <cit> . because the aba content in aba-deficient mutants was 75% lower than the normal level, both the plant and fruit did not show the normal growth observed in the wild type; the total fruit weight and average fruit weight in aba-deficient mutant fruits were reduced compared with wild-type fruit, and the plant weight was 50% lower in the aba-deficient plant than in the wild type, indicating that aba was not only required for plant growth, but was also indispensable for fruit development and ripening  <cit> . in addition, application of exogenous aba can increase the pigmentation and promoted ripening of sweet cherry fruits  <cit> . exogenous aba accelerates fruit ripening, and fluridone or ndga treatment delays fruit ripening by aba inhibition  <cit> . sun et al.  <cit>  reported that suppressed slnced <dig> by rna interference resulted in reduced aba accumulation in transgenic fruit, which led to down-regulation of genes encoding major cell wall catabolic enzymes. these reports demonstrate that aba plays important roles in fruit ripening.

genes involved in rare mutations that completely inhibit normal ripening have been identified; such advancement is considered as a major breakthrough in determining the transcriptional control of tomato ripening  <cit> . these mutations include rin , nor  and cnr . gene cloning efforts have shown that rin results from the deletion of the last exon of a tomato mads-box transcription factor gene ; rin is necessary to promote tomato fruit ripening  <cit> . the mutation of rin affects all of the involved ripening pathways; this finding supports the function of this gene as a master regulator of ripening  <cit> . chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with dna microarray analysis and transcriptome analysis have been performed to identify  <dig> direct rin target genes that contain a rin binding site and exhibit rin-dependent positive or negative regulation during fruit ripening  <cit> . the targets of rin include known genes, such as acs <dig>  acs <dig>  nr , e <dig>  pg , tbg <dig> , exp <dig> , psy <dig> , nor, cnr, tdr <dig>  hb- <dig> and rin itself  <cit> . another study has revealed new targets, including bhlh , nac , basic leucine zipper  transcription factor , zinc finger protein and apetala2a  <cit> .

in addition to rin, cnr and nor, other tf genes, including agamous-like <dig>  hd-zip homeobox protein- <dig>  ethylene response factor <dig>  fruitfull <dig>  fruitful <dig>  slmads <dig> and aprr2-like, function in tomato fruit ripening  <cit> . nor, a member of the nac domain family, functions upstream of ethylene in the tomato fruit ripening cascade; nor mutation leads to a non-ripening phenotype similar to that observed in rin  <cit> . slnac <dig> positively regulates fruit ripening by affecting ethylene synthesis and carotenoid accumulation  <cit> . however, the mechanisms of action of the other nac tfs involved in fruit ripening remain unknown.

slnac <dig> interacts with tomato leaf curl virus replication accessory protein and enhances viral replication  <cit> . this gene is also involved in abiotic stress  <cit>  and pathogen infection response  <cit> . in the present study, the transcripts of slnac <dig> highly accumulated in fruit tissues and increased with fruit ripening. the overexpression of slnac <dig> reduced the accumulation of total carotenoid and lycopene, ethylene production, fruit firmness and thickness of pericarp, but increased abscisic acid  contents. in transgenic fruits, genes involved in lycopene and ethylene biosynthesis were downregulated, whereas genes related to lutein, β-carotene and aba synthesis as well as genes related to cell wall metabolism were upregulated. in addition, yeast one-hybrid assay results indicated that slnac <dig> interacted with slpsy <dig>  slacs <dig> and slaco <dig>  these results suggested that slnac <dig> regulated tomato fruit ripening via ethylene-dependent and aba-dependent ripening pathways in slnac <dig> overexpression lines.

RESULTS
slnac <dig> is involved in tomato fruit ripening
the expression profile of slnac <dig> in the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, sepals, green fruit and seeds was explored by quantitative real-time pcr . slnac <dig> transcript showed higher expression levels in flowers, green fruits and seeds and the most transcripts of slnac <dig> accumulated in green fruit, whereas lower expression levels were in root, stems and leaves . these results suggested that slnac <dig> may be related to fruit development. in line with this, transcripts of slnac <dig> accumulated more at the immature green stage, then decreased at the mature green stage, and gradually increased until  <dig> d after breaker . these results indicated that slnac <dig> is likely to function in tomato fruit tissue.figure  <dig>

to test whether slnac <dig> is involved in tomato fruit ripening, we created the transgenic tomato lines by overexpressing this gene with its full-length cdna under camv 35s promter. ten independent overexpressed  transgenic lines were obtained. among them, oe- <dig>  oe- <dig> and oe-21were detected with the higher expression levels of slnac <dig> , and were selected to perform the further experiments. in figure 1d, the ripe fruits of three oe lines exhibited yellow or orange appearance compared with those of the wild-type  line. these data indicate that overexpression of slnac <dig> inhibits normal fruit ripening.

approximately  <dig> nac tfs in tomato are found in the plant transcription factor database   <cit> . to confirm only slnac <dig> was overexpressed in transgenic plants, we tested the expression of four other nacs that contain sequences with higher homology to slnac <dig>  as indicated in the phylogenetic tree in the database. in figure  <dig>  the expression levels of these four other nacs were not significantly different at different stages between oe and wt fruits. these data indicated that overexression of slnac <dig> does not affect the expression of closely related nac genes.figure  <dig>

overexpression of slnac <dig> gene affects fruit colouring and related gene expressions
lycopene is responsible for the red pigmentation of ripe tomato fruit; lycopene accounts for 70% to 90% of carotenoids in most varieties, whereas β-carotene accounts for the bulk of the remaining proportion   <cit> . in the present study, the total carotenoid contents of oe fruits were significantly reduced to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of wt fruits in oe- <dig>  oe- <dig> and oe- <dig>  respectively . the lutein contents of oe fruits accumulated by  <dig>  to  <dig>  times higher than those of wt fruits and β-carotene contents of oe fruits also accumulated about  <dig>  times higher than those of wt fruits. however, the lycopene contents in oe fruits were reduced by  <dig> % to  <dig> % compared with that of the wt fruits . these data are consistent with fruit pigmentation.figure  <dig>

considering the distinct changes in the carotenoid composition of oe fruits, we analysed the genes’ transcript levels involved in carotenoid biosynthesis  by qrt-pcr. psy <dig> is a rate-limiting enzyme of carotenoid biosynthesis in tomato and is partly responsible for regulating flux via the pathway during ripening  <cit> . qrt-pcr results suggested that the expression level of slpsy <dig> was downregulated in the oe fruits accounting for reduced lycopene and total carotenoids in ripening fruits . however, sllcyb , sllcye  and slcycb  were upregulated in oe fruits, demonstrating the metabolism of lycopene to β-carotene and lutein . these results suggest that the altered pigmentation of oe fruits is consistent with the changes in the expression of genes related to lycopene synthesis and decomposition observed.

overexpression of slnac <dig> reduces ethylene emission by downregulating the genes related to ethylene biosynthesis
ethylene regulates carotenoid and lycopene accumulation during ripening by upregulating slpsy <dig>  <cit> . fruits released ethylene after br was measured to determine whether or not the phenotype observed is caused by the change in ethylene contents. ethylene production of oe and wt fruits had the similar pattern and the climacteric peak of both oe and wt fruits emerged at b <dig>  but the climacteric peaks of the oe fruits were clearly lower than those of the wt fruits; these peaks were reduced by 54% to 79% . we then detected the relative mrna levels of the genes related to ethylene biosynthesis. the expressions of slacs <dig>  slacs <dig> and slaco <dig> in the oe fruits exhibited varying degrees of repression compared with those of wt fruits; this result is consistent with the production of ethylene . after the fruits of the oe- <dig> line at the breaker stage were treated with ethephon for  <dig> d, the phenotypes of the treated fruit could be partly resumed . these results illustrated that the pigmentation of slnac <dig> overexpresion tomato fruits is partly dependent on ethylene.figure  <dig>

slnac <dig> can interact with slpsy <dig>  slacs <dig> and slaco <dig> in yih experiment
transcription factors often regulate gene expression by binding to their promoters to promote or inhibit the corresponding transcription. so we wanted to know whether slnac <dig> could directly bind to the promoters of slpsy <dig>  slacs <dig> and slaco <dig>  the highly conserved positively charged subdomains c and d  of nac tfs can bind to dna  <cit> . cacg  <cit>  and c/tacg  <cit>  sequences are the core dna motif recognised by arabidopsis anac. selth et al.  <cit>  reported that the n-terminal  <dig> amino acid residues of slnac <dig> contain the five conserved subdomains that comprise the nac domain and slnac <dig> acts as a transcription activator in yeast. on the basis of these previous studies, we selected the fragment containing subdomains c and d of slnac <dig> and the promoter regions containing the c/tacg sequence to perform yeast one-hybrid assay. as shown in figure 5b, after cotransformation, the yeast strains containing the dna binding domain of slnac <dig> and the promoters of slpsy <dig>  slacs <dig>  and slaco <dig> could grow on sd/-ura, sd/-leu and sd/-leu/aba auxotrophic medium, suggesting slnac <dig> might interacted with the regulatory regions of slpsy <dig>  slacs <dig> and slaco <dig> in vivo. this result indicated that slnac <dig> regulates the expression of these genes to finely regulate lycopene and ethylene synthesis.figure  <dig>

overexpression of slnac <dig> caused broad ripening changes
fruit softening is associated with ripening and ethylene can accelerate fruit softening. as such, we measured fruit firmness  to determine whether or not oe fruits softened later than wt fruits. our results showed that the firmness of oe fruits was lower than that of the wt fruits at the same stage, meaning the earlier softening of oe fruits, which was inconsistent with ethylene emission . in addition, fruit pericarp thickness was notably reduced in mature oe fruits  with over 50% reduction at b <dig> stage . reduced pericarp thickness is correlated with reduced firmness in mature oe fruit, suggesting the contribution of pericarp thickness to fruit softening. moreover, the seed size of oe fruits was larger than that of wt fruits and oe fruits produced more seeds than wt fruits . these results indicated that the overexpression of slnac <dig> resulted in broad changes of fruit development and ripening.figure  <dig>

overexpression of slnac <dig> led to aba accumulation
the inconformity between ethylene and fruit softening of oe fruits implied that other factors except ethylene might play roles in fruit softening in tomato. sun et al.  <cit>  reported that aba affected cell wall catabolism during tomato fruit ripening by regulating the expression of major catabolic genes and the aba peak often appears earlier than ethylene peak. to determine whether the different softening rate between oe and wt fruits was resulted from aba changes, we measured the endogenous aba contents of oe- <dig> and wt fruits at br and b <dig> stages. figure 7a showed that aba contents of oe- <dig> fruits were higher than those of wt fruits at the same stages. similarly, the expression of slnced <dig>  and slnced <dig> in oe fruits was upregulated compared with those in wt fruits, especially at the early stages of ripening . also, the expression levels of genes related to cell wall metabolism in oe fruits, such as slpg, slexp <dig>  slcel <dig>  and slwiv <dig> , were enhanced compared with those in wt fruits . for further validation, oe and wt fruits were treated with ngda  at breaker stage. after ndga treatment, the firmness of fruits was increased compared with untreated fruits . these results indicated that overexpression of slnac <dig> led to aba accumulation, which at least contributed to fruit softening.figure  <dig>

discussion
the development of red pigmentation in ripening tomato fruit is caused by the accumulation of lycopene  and β-carotene , which represent the majority of the total fruit carotenoids  <cit> . nor is a member of nac transcription factor and its mutant nor is phenotypically similar to rin in that nor fruit fail to produce climacteric ethylene or ripen yet show responsiveness to ethylene at the molecular level while similarly failing to ripen in response to ethylene  <cit> . nor rnai tomato showed ripening defects  from the b +  <dig> stage in pericarp compared with wt ripening fruits, suggesting alteration of carotenoid composition. additionally, the placenta of slnac <dig> rnai fruits failed to acquire red pigmentation and softening appearance from the b +  <dig> stage  <cit> . our results showed that fruits overexpressing slnac <dig> displayed yellow/orange colour . the phenotype of slnac <dig> overexpression fruits was different from that of nor and slnac <dig> rnai fruits. the yellow/orange fruits were caused by the decreased accumulation of lycopene and elevated lutein and β-carotene , partially explaining why oe fruits failed to fully turn red. qrt-pcr analysis showed that psy <dig>  a major regulator of flux towards carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, was significantly reduced because of the overexpression of slnac <dig> . in addition, the chromoplast and chloroplast lycopene β-cyclases  in oe fruits were upregulated compared with those in wt fruits . the upregulation of slpsy <dig> and the downregulation of slcycb are at least partly dependent on ethylene; the relative ratio of lycopene to β-carotene in ripening tomato fruit is mediated by both of these processes  <cit> . these data suggested that slnac <dig> participated in tomato fruit pigmentation by regulating the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in overexpression lines. on the basis of yeast one-hybrid experiment , we can hypothesise that slnac <dig> may function in the regulation of the carotenoid pathway flux towards lutein and β-carotene and away from lycopene in slnac <dig> oe fruits.

tomato is physiologically classified as a climacteric fruit based on the dramatic induction of respiration and ethylene at the onset of ripening. ethylene functions as a key regulatory hormone in fruit ripening  <cit> . ethylene emission of slnac <dig> overexpression lines was reduced , suggesting that slnac <dig> is a negative regulator of ethylene biosynthesis in maturing oe fruit. ethylene synthesis in ripening tomato fruit is regulated by acs and aco gene families  <cit> . in tomato, the predominant acs transcripts, namely, acs1a, acs <dig> and acs <dig>  accumulate in ripening fruits. both acs <dig> and acs <dig> mediate the burst of autocatalytic ethylene synthesis, a process typically observed in climacteric ripening  <cit> . oeller et al.  <cit>  found that acs <dig> is the predominant acs mrna in ripening fruits, and the repression of this gene blocks ripening. the upregulation of acs <dig>  <cit>  and aco <dig>  <cit>  resulted in ethylene and carotenoid accumulation. in agreement with the reduced ethylene production in the oe fruits, the transcript level of crucial genes involved in ethylene synthesis  were suppressed to varying degrees . moreover, exogenous ethephon treatment partially recovered the phenotype of oe fruits . these results suggested that slnac <dig> is implicated in oe fruit ripening probably by interacting with ethylene pathway. tagl <dig> positively regulates ethylene synthesis; furthermore, reduced ethylene and a shift toward lutein and β-carotene accumulation occur in ripening fruit as a consequence of the repression of tagl <dig>  <cit> . the yeast one-hybrid assay results showed that slnac <dig> could bind to the regulatory regions of slpsy <dig>  slacs <dig>  and slaco <dig> . according to the previous report and the yeast one-hybrid results, we speculated that slnac <dig> negatively regulated ethylene synthesis in oe fruits.

the tomato mads box tf rin, one of the earliest acting ripening regulators, is required for both ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent ripening regulatory pathways. rin participates in the regulation of lycopene accumulation and ethylene production by binding to their promoters, such as acs <dig>  acs <dig>  aco <dig> and psy <dig>  which requires cnr  <cit> . the overexpression of slnac <dig> and the repression of rin  <cit> , cnr  <cit> , hb- <dig>  <cit> , tagl <dig>  <cit>  or slnac <dig>  <cit>  all reduced lycopene accumulation and ethylene synthesis and resulted in similar non-ripening fruits. furthermore, rin, cnr, hb- <dig>  tagl <dig> and slnac <dig> were all reported to be the targets of rin  <cit> . consequently, there might be some relationship between slnac <dig> and rin in regulating tomato fruit ripening. however, it remains unclear now and will be further investigated.

softening is another important sign of fruit ripening and related to fruit quality and storage time. the softening of fleshy fruits is caused by changes in the structure and composition of their flesh cell wall. in climacteric fruits, the degradation of pectin and cellulose depends on ethylene during softening  <cit> . the results of fruit firmness analysis showed that the softening rate of oe fruits was inconsistent with ethylene production , suggesting there may be an ethylene-independent softening pathway in tomato fruit. it has been reported that slnced <dig> suppression by rna interference reduced aba accumulation in the transgenic fruits, downregulated the genes encoding for major cell wall catabolic enzymes, and then increased the firmness of the transgenic fruits  <cit> . the levels of ethylene, total carotenoids, lycopene and β-carotene, and the relative transcript levels of slacs <dig>  slacs <dig>  slaco <dig> and slpsy <dig> were enhanced in slnced <dig> suppression fruit  <cit> . overexpressing slnac <dig> increased the aba content and expression levels of genes encoding for cell wall metabolism, leading to reduced fruit firmness . in addition, the levels of ethylene, total carotenoids, lycopene, and the relative transcript levels of slacs <dig>  slacs <dig>  slaco <dig> and slpsy <dig> were reduced in slnac <dig> overexpression fruit . these results were inconsist with the previous study. all these changes suggested that aba negatively regulated fruit firmness. nevertheless, the detailed mechanism that slnac <dig> regulates aba synthesis is unclear now. vrebalov et al.  <cit>  found that a decrease in the number of pericarp cell layers yield thinner pericarp tissues than normal characteristics. in our study, the pericarp thickness degree of the oe fruits was lower than that of the wt fruits . this lower value indicated that the pericarp tissues of the oe fruits contained few cell layers; as such, a thinner pericarp was formed. saladie´ et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that fruit turgor is a major determinant of tomato fruit firmness, and as such, direct changes in pericarp thickness combined with resulting effects on water retention are likely to account for the increased softening of tagl <dig> repressed fruit. thus the reduced firmness or increased softening of slnac <dig> overexpression fruits might be caused by thinner pericarp. overall, slnac <dig> functions in tomato fruit ripening via ethylene-dependent and aba-dependent pathways in slnac <dig> overexpression lines.

CONCLUSIONS
slnac <dig> transcripts accumulated in several tissues, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, sepals, fruits and seeds, accumulated as fruit ripening occurred and reached the highest level at b <dig>  slnac <dig> affected tomato fruit pigmentation by regulating the lycopene and ethylene biosynthesis. in addition, slnac <dig> regulated tomato fruit softening possibly by affecting aba synthesis and changing the thickness of the pericarp. these data provided a new regulator functioning in fruit ripening and will probably contribute to further mapping of the regulatory network of tomato fruit ripening.
