BACKGROUND
mitogen-activated protein kinases , such as extracellular regulated kinase   <cit> , are activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine/threonine residues in their activation loops. mapks can then be deactivated by phosphatases that remove these phosphate groups from their activation loop. one such class of phosphatases, dual-specificity phosphatases , is unique in that it can dephosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. the ramchandran lab has shown that dusp <dig> is necessary for early vascular patterning in vertebrates, and is mutated in patients with vascular anomalies  <cit> . dusp <dig> plays a regulatory role in vascular development based on its ability to specifically interact with and dephosphorylate phosphorylated erk  . indeed, we identified a clinically relevant serine to proline mutation  that is associated with vascular defects  <cit> . this mutation has been shown previously by our group to interfere with the dephosphorylating activity of dusp <dig> protein  <cit> , and makes the protein hypoactive. however, the direct causal role of s147p in vascular anomaly progression is yet to be established. nevertheless, dusp <dig> is a critical drug target for vascular-related diseases, and more broadly, mapks and their dusp partners are involved in cell signaling that is directly involved in a wide range of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders . recently, dusp <dig> has gained increased attention in the scientific literature  especially as it relates to loss or gain of expression of dusp <dig> in murine models, and its associated phenotypic changes in both the immune and cancer biology systems. dusp <dig> knockout  mice are alive, and display no overt phenotype, indicating that it is dispensable for embryonic development. however, holmes et al did report that these mice showed increased function and survival of eosinophils, a key player in the immune system’s ability to clear parasitic infections  <cit> . further, rushworth et al reported increased sensitivity to a skin cancer model in their murine model  <cit> . in terms of the vasculature, the dusp <dig> ko rat displays enhanced myogenic response and autoregulation of cerebral blood flow  <cit> . taken together, these studies demonstrate that inhibition of dusp <dig> will result in biologically relevant changes in vivo.

from a conformation perspective, dusp <dig> is comprised of two domains, an n-terminal erk binding domain  and a c-terminal phosphatase domain   <cit> . while there is no structure available for intact dusp <dig>  there is a crystal structure of the pd  <cit> . the dusp <dig> pd structure has two anionic sulfate groups bound in the active site near the catalytic cys <dig> , and separated by  <dig>  Å. these sulfates had been proposed to occupy the same binding pockets that are occupied by the phosphate groups on the substrate  <cit> . for the erk <dig> substrate, the pthr-glu-ptyr tripeptide region of the erk <dig> activation loop presumably occupies this region in the dusp <dig> pd  <cit> .

a molecular model based on the crystal structures of the human dusp <dig> pd and erk <dig>  and a homology model of the dusp <dig> ebd, illustrates the bivalent nature of the interaction between the two domains of dusp <dig> and the erk <dig> substrate   <cit> . the current study has identified small molecule inhibitors that occupy the active site pocket on the dusp <dig> pd, and act as inhibitors of the phosphatase enzymatic activity. we further tested some of these compounds as inhibitors of full-length dusp <dig> and in in vitro assays, to relate inhibition results and conclusions to more biologically and clinically relevant situations.fig.  <dig>

methods
molecular docking
the center for structure-based drug design and development  chemical library, consisting of  <dig>  drug-like chemicals, was prepared in electronic format as two-dimensional  sdf files. using pipeline pilot  <cit> , the protonation state of all compounds was adjusted to reflect the most prevalent form at a ph of  <dig> . corina  <cit>  was used to convert these files to three-dimensional  pdb coordinate files, which resulted in energy-minimized 3d structures. the files were then processed with the python script prepare_ligand <dig> py, which comes with the autodock tools suite  <cit> . this script generates a pdbqt file and adds partial charges to the ligand, sets all torsions in the ligand to active , and merges all non-polar hydrogen atoms.

the dusp <dig> pd structure   <cit>  was prepared for docking using the autodock tools suite  <cit> . grid maps were used in the energy calculations performed by autodock. partial charges were added and all non-polar hydrogen atoms were merged, resulting in a pdbqt file. the  <dig> different grid maps, one for each of the different atoms present in the chemical library of compounds , were generated using autogrid <dig>  <cit> . a grid box, the site used to dock the ligands, was positioned to cover the entire protein in a blind docking experiment to ensure unbiased identification of binding location and orientation.

the docking parameter file , which contains the parameters that autodock <dig> uses to dock ligands into the protein, was prepared using the python script prepare_dpf <dig> py, and default docking parameters were used, except that  <dig> separate docking calculations were performed with each calculation consisting of  <dig> , <dig> energy evaluations, and a root mean square deviation  tolerance set to  <dig>  angstroms . the dpf files were then automatically docked using the mugrid cluster  with htcondor  <cit>  and autodock <dig>  <cit>  using the lamarckian genetic algorithm local search method to perform the optimization of docking poses. the docking poses were then clustered on the basis of the rmsd between the coordinates of the atoms in a given ligand, and were ranked on the basis of calculated free energy of binding. the docking log files were then analyzed using the python script summarize_results <dig> py contained in the shell script sumresults_ <dig> py  <cit> , which rank orders all the dockings by binding energy. the results were then analyzed to find the best-clustered compounds with lowest free energy of binding as determined by autodock <dig> . additional docking of all experimentally tested chemicals was performed as described above, but with  <dig> dockings trials.

ligand-based searching
as previously described, the csd <dig> chemical library was electronically prepared and protonation state adjusted using pipeline pilot  <cit> . using openeye scientific software’s omega <dig>  <cit> , three dimensional coordinates were calculated and stored in openeye scientific software’s preferred file format, .oeb.gz, for subsequent molecular overlay evaluation. openeye scientific software’s rapid overlay of chemical structures   <cit>  software was used to search for molecules with similar shape and electronic properties to a lead molecule. lead molecules identified from dusp <dig> docking and inhibition studies were used as chemical queries to search a database of food and drug administration  approved drugs, to identify fda approved drugs that might also be dusp <dig> inhibitors.

the zinc library  <cit>  of  <dig> million commercially available chemicals was obtained as 2d sdf files and prepared similarly to the csd <dig> chemical library for use with openeye scientific software’s rocs. this further expanded the availability of chemical analogs available for experimental screening. rocs calculations were also performed against the drugbank  <cit>  database of fda approved drugs.

solid carbazole  was placed in a 50-ml round-bottom flask and 67 % h2so <dig>  was added drop-wise at 22 °c and a slurry thus obtained was stirred and heated at 115 ± 5 °c for 6 h. the resulting dark solution was cooled to room temperature and poured into a saturated nacl solution  containing naoh  to afford an ash-colored precipitate, which was filtered, washed with saturated nacl solution  and dried at 90 °c for 10 h to get  <dig>  g of the crude product.

the dried solid was dissolved in a mixture of dioxane  and distilled/deionized water  and heated under reflux for 12 h. the resulting solution was cooled to room temperature and was extracted with diethyl ether  to remove nonpolar impurities. the aqueous layer was neutralized by a dropwise addition of naoh solution  with continuous monitoring of ph using ph paper. the resulting solution was concentrated to ~10 ml and acetone was added to afford a white powder of rr <dig> . 1h-nmr :  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , 1h-nmr :  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ; 13c-nmr :  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> .

protein production
the dusp <dig> pd gene was synthesized by blue heron  in both an active wild type form ) and an inactive form, where the catalytic cysteine was mutated to a serine ). the genes were inserted into origene pex plasmids with ampicillin resistance and an n-terminal hexa-histidine tag to facilitate protein purification. plasmids were transformed into bl <dig> cells  for expression.

for unlabeled dusp <dig> pd preparation, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 2 l of lb  media, containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin. cells were grown at 37 °c to an od <dig> of  <dig>  and then induced with  <dig>  mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  for 4 h at 37 °c, then for 14 h at 16 °c. cells were harvested using centrifugation and frozen prior to purification. thawed cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm tris, 300 mm nacl, 5 mm imidazole, and 10 % glycerol at ph  <dig> . lysate was centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 1 h. the supernatant was loaded on to ni-sepharose fast flow resin  and washed three times successively with five column volumes of lysis buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 305 mm imidazole. protein was then dialyzed in a buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate and 2 mm dithiothreitol  at ph  <dig> .

for 15 n-labeled dusp <dig> pd preparation , an overnight culture was used to inoculate 2 l of lb media supplemented with 50 μg/ml of ampicillin. cells were grown to an od <dig> of  <dig>  at 37 °c, then harvested and washed with m <dig> minimal media   <cit> . cells were resuspended in 500 ml m <dig> minimal media containing  <dig>  g 15nh4cl, 2 g d-glucose, 5 ml basal medium eagle with earle’s salts and sodium bicarbonate ,  <dig>  g l-glutamine   <dig>  ml 1 m mgso <dig>  and  <dig>  ml 1 m cacl <dig>   <cit> . additionally, a metal mix containing zn, mn, cu, co, b, and mo salts was added to supply cells with necessary micronutrients  <cit> . cells were allowed to acclimate for 30 min at 37 °c, then induced with 1 mm iptg for an additional 4 h at 37 °c. cells were harvested and 15 n-labeled protein was purified as described before with the addition of 2 mm dtt during all purifications steps.

p-nitrophenol phosphate  activity assay
to measure enzymatic activity of the dusp <dig> pd and the inhibitory capacity of selected molecules, an in vitro phosphatase assay was developed based on previous studies  <cit> . in this assay, dusp <dig> pd will dephosphorylate the substrate p-nitrophenol phosphate , yielding p-nitrophenolate, which absorbs at 405 nm with an extinction coefficient of  <dig>  m−1 cm− <dig> 

thus, an increase in absorbance at 405 nm corresponds to the turnover of pnpp to p-nitrophenolate. the assay was initially optimized in 1 ml quartz cuvettes, then was subsequently optimized for and validated in a 96-well plate format. all ic <dig> values were obtained using the 96-well plate assay format . the assay buffer contained 100 mm tris, 100 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride, and 1 mm dtt at ph  <dig> . the pnpp substrate was prepared as a 50 mm stock by dissolving the solid substrate in assay buffer. the dusp <dig> pd and pnpp were assayed initially in a cuvette  and initial velocities were fitted to the michaelis-menten equation:  <dig> v=vmaxskm+s where v is the initial velocity, vmax is the maximum velocity, km is the michaelis constant, and  is the concentration of pnpp. data were fitted using a nonlinear least squares fit to eq.  <dig>  with graphpad prism  <dig> software.

validation of pnpp assay for high throughput screening 
for the 96-well plate validation assay, sodium orthovanadate  was utilized as a positive control for inhibition  <cit>  at a final concentration of 10 μm, to completely block dusp <dig> enzymatic activity. all plate assays were performed in standard 96-well clear bottom plates  with a total assay volume of 200 μl, using a spectramax m <dig> microplate reader . the plate validation assay was performed with replicate columns of positive control wells, negative control wells and blank wells. blank columns contained only buffer and pnpp. negative control  contained buffer, pnpp, and dusp <dig> pd; and, positive control contained the same components, but also contained 10 μm sodium orthovanadate. the plate was then shaken and allowed to equilibrate in the spectrophotometer at 25 °c for 30 min. after incubation, 4 μl of a 50 μm enzyme stock was dispensed into appropriate wells utilizing a single-channel pipette. this produced a final enzyme concentration of 1 μm. before a read was taken, the plate was shaken for five seconds. the initial rate for the dusp <dig> pd reaction was linear for approximately 90 min; and, the plate was kept in the spectrophotometer at 25 °c for an additional 80 min after the kinetic read. the endpoint reading was subsequently taken at 90 min after initiation of reaction.

slopes from the kinetic read, as well as single-point absorbance values at the 90-minute endpoint read, were then averaged. for blank wells and positive control wells, both slope values  and single point absorbance values  were approximately zero, as expected . standard deviations were calculated and a z’ value  <cit>  subsequently determined using the following equation:  <dig> z'=1−3σp+σnμp−μn where σp is the standard deviation for the positive control, σn is the standard deviation for the negative control, μp is the mean for the positive control, and μn is the mean for the negative control. the z’ value is a coefficient denoting the quality of a high throughput screening assay, reflecting both the variation in data and dynamic range for the assay. a good assay exhibits a high signal to background ratio. a z’-factor of  <dig>  reflects an ideal assay; and, for an assay to be considered reliable, must exceed  <dig>   <cit> .

ic <dig> measurements
ic <dig> values were obtained using the assay described above, in  <dig> well plates. the maximum inhibitor concentration screened in any plate was 300 mm and the minimum screened concentration was 1 μm. the ic <dig> plate was designed so that the first column of wells served as blanks, with wells containing only buffer and substrate. the second column of wells functioned as the plate negative control, with each well containing buffer, substrate and enzyme. the remaining wells in the plate contained buffer, substrate, enzyme, and varying amounts of inhibitor, with inhibitor concentration increasing from left to right across the plate. data points were collected at a minimum in triplicate, and inhibitor concentrations were chosen to provide data equally spread on a logarithmic scale. the composition of buffer and the concentrations of substrate and enzyme utilized were identical to those in the plate validation assay. after initiation and shaking, a ten-minute kinetic read was taken.

for each plate assayed, the slope values for all negative control wells were averaged and the measured value considered representative of full enzymatic activity. fractional activity was then calculated by dividing the slope of each inhibitor well by this value, determining the relative amount of enzyme activity observed at each concentration of inhibitor. values were then plotted as percent activity versus the log of the concentration of inhibitor, and fitted to the following equation:  <dig> y=bottom+top−bottom1+10x−logic <dig> where top and bottom are plateaus for the values of initial velocity when uninhibited and fully inhibited, respectively.

nephelometry
nephelometry is a technique for measuring the relative aggregation of particles in solution, based on the light-scattering properties of molecular aggregates  <cit> . we performed nephelometry to explore the ability of the chemicals studied herein to form aggregates, which can lead to artifactual inhibition effects. compounds were tested for aggregation in 96-well plates using a buffer containing 100 mm tris base, 100 mm sodium chloride, and 5 mm magnesium chloride at ph  <dig> . each compound analyzed in these experiments contained concentrations of compound ranging from 10-100 μm, recorded in quadruplet. each plate was analyzed at two separate gain values of  <dig> and  <dig>  data were collected using a bmg nephelostar plus, equipped with a 635 nm laser.

nmr binding assay
nmr samples of dusp <dig> pd were prepared for 2d 1h-15n hsqc  spectral titration studies. the 15 n-labeled dusp <dig> pd protein was concentrated using an amicon ultra- <dig> centrifugal device  to 600 μm. nmr samples were prepared with the following conditions for rr505: 250 μm rr <dig>  250 μm dusp <dig> pd, 10 % d2o, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm kcl, and 2 mm dtt at ph  <dig>  and for csd3-2320:  <dig> or 500 μm csd3- <dig>  500 μm dusp <dig> pd, 10 % d2o, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm kcl, and 2 mm dtt at ph  <dig> . nmr experiments were performed on a 500 mhz varian nmr system using a triple resonance probe with z-axis gradients at 25 °c.

erk dephosphorylation assay
for this assay, 10 ng of gst-tagged recombinant phosphorylated erk <dig>  was incubated with and without the indicated dusp <dig> proteins  for 15 min at room temperature, with or without the indicated drugs. the reactions were halted with 2x laemmli sample buffer and subjected to sds-page. the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride  and immunoblotted using antibodies to perk  and total erk, which includes both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated erk <dig> and erk <dig> . bound antibodies were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse igg  and anti-rabbit igg , respectively, and ecl reagents  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. for calculating ic <dig> values, gel bands were imaged by chemiluminescence with either film or digital image capture by a fluorchem hd <dig> imager . density of each band was quantified with imagej software by using the gel analysis tool. relative values of phosphorylated erk present for each drug concentration treatment compared to perk only controls were calculated. these relative values were then used to obtain ic <dig> values with graphpad prism  <dig> software. each experiment was repeated at least three independent times, and ic <dig> values provided as a range.

RESULTS
docking and ligand-based in silico searches yield candidate small molecules that target the dusp <dig> pd domain
in this study, we were interested in identifying inhibitors that could selectively target dual-specificity phosphatase  <dig> , which we have shown previously to be mutated in patients with vascular anomalies. as shown in fig. 1a, dusp <dig> contains two domains namely an erk-binding domain  and a phosphatase domain  that are fused together by an unstructured linker region. the x-ray structure of pd of human dusp <dig> was previously reported   <cit> , while the structure of ebd was constructed using homology modeling based on the solution structure  of human mkp- <dig> protein  as a template  <cit> . the  <dig> amino acid linker region connecting the two domains, which is of unknown structure, was prepared manually. a model of the human dusp5-erk <dig> complex  illustrates how dusp <dig>  wraps around erk <dig> , its natural substrate, with the eb and pd dusp <dig> domains located on opposite sides of erk <dig>  the model was prepared as described in our previous paper  <cit> , and the relative orientation of erk <dig> and dusp <dig> is based on molecular dynamics simulations described previously  <cit> .

in order to identify inhibitors for dusp <dig>  we performed in-silico docking of  <dig>  chemicals from the csd <dig> in-house collection into the pd domain of dusp <dig>  the docking procedure produced a rank-ordered list of compounds that were tested using the pnpp assay . one promising compound, sm1842—a trisulfonated carbazole, displayed attributes associated with lead-like chemicals   <cit> . the 1h nmr spectrum of the commercially sourced sm <dig> sample did not match the expected signal pattern for trisulfonated carbazole , and therefore this compound was resynthesized and its spectrum was compared with the spectrum of commercial sm <dig>  the resynthesized compound, rr <dig> , displayed the expected 1h nmr spectrum for the trisulfonated carbazole. an additional synthesis of a tetrasulfonated carbazole rr <dig>  and comparison of its 1h nmr spectrum with that of the commercial sm <dig> demonstrated that the commercial sample was  a mixture of rr <dig> and rr <dig>  i.e. the tri- and tetrasulfonated carbazoles . further experimental analysis made use of only pure samples, i.e. rr <dig> and rr <dig> table  <dig> structures, docking energies, and ic <dig> values of dusp <dig> pd inhibitors

the docking pose from the lowest energy cluster for rr <dig>  had a calculated binding energy of − <dig>  kcal/mol and a cluster size of  <dig> . using the chemical structure of rr <dig> as a search template, additional chemical libraries were computationally screened to identify related structures that could also be tested. one such compound, naphthalene trisulfonate , was identified from the in-house collection of chemicals as well as from the zinc collection  <cit>  of commercially available chemicals. this compound was identified using rocs  <cit> , which matches chemical queries to compounds in chemical libraries based on molecular shape and electrostatic properties. figure 2b shows the overlay of rr <dig> and nts, using rocs. nts docked similarly to rr <dig> in the dusp <dig> pd active site pocket . interestingly, the lowest energy poses for nts  and rr <dig> show a flipped binding mode relative to each other . we hypothesize based on the rocs alignment  that the docking algorithm would position the ligands similarly. while this is not the case for the lowest energy cluster, it is the case for the second lowest energy cluster. similarly, rr <dig> was flipped relative to the lowest energy cluster pose of rr <dig> . and again, the second lowest energy cluster pose for rr <dig>  matched that of the lowest energy pose of rr <dig> fig.  <dig>

expression, purification and assay of the dusp <dig> pd domain
to assess the activity of the identified compounds from in-silico docking, we expressed and purified the phosphatase domain of dusp <dig> protein referred to as dusp <dig> pd , and tested it in an enzymatic assay with p-nitrophenyl phosphate  as a substrate. protein was expressed in e. coli and purified as described above. sds-page gel analysis of dusp <dig> pd indicates >95 % purity . the 2d 1h-15n hsqc nmr spectrum for a sample of the dusp <dig> pd protein shows good chemical shift dispersion, indicating the protein is well-folded . we also obtained 2d 1h-15n hsqc nmr spectra in the presence of 250 μm rr <dig>  and observed cross-peak shifting or exchange broadening, consistent with direct binding of rr <dig> to 15 n-labeled dusp <dig> pd. to assess the ability of the compounds identified via docking to inhibit dusp <dig> pd  activity, a phosphatase assay was developed based on a previously published assay  <cit> . the substrate, pnpp, has been shown to react with a wide variety of phosphatases  <cit> . the assay was performed in 1-ml quartz cuvettes, at various substrate concentrations, and initial velocities were measured at the wavelength of 405 nm due to the formation of p-nitrophenolate. initial velocity data were fitted to the michaelis-menten equation , yielding a vmax of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  and a km of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm. since some of the inhibitors to be screened were dissolved in dmso, the effect of  <dig>   <dig>  and 4 % dmso was investigated by substituting appropriate quantities of dmso for some of the buffer mixture. relative rates with and without dmso were compared and plotted in fig. 3b. dmso appears to activate the dusp <dig> pd reaction, consistent with a previous report for dusp <dig>  <cit> . thus, to ensure consistent results we performed all assays on compounds dissolved in dmso while maintaining a fixed concentration of dmso.fig.  <dig>

to measure ic <dig> values, a control inhibitor was used, and the assay was performed with the addition of a known broad-spectrum inhibitor of phosphatases, sodium orthovanadate   <cit> . initial experiments were performed in 1 ml cuvettes and concentrations of vanadate were varied. initial velocities from kinetic reads were plotted as a function of the log of vanadate concentration and fitted to equation  <dig>  to obtain the ic <dig> of 88 ±  <dig> nm .

development of hts assay for screening inhibitors and validation
the pnpp phosphatase assay was also performed in a plate format to increase throughput by which inhibitors could be screened. to validate the plate assay, the z’ factor  <cit>  was determined using the plate arrangement described above. the absorbance values for the end-point assays and the slopes for the kinetic assays were averaged , and z’ values were calculated using equation  <dig>  both the end point assay  and the kinetic assay  formats resulted in z’ factors in the acceptable range for an hts assay.table  <dig> dusp <dig> pd pnpp enzymatic assay data for z’ calculation 



compounds identified by protein-based  and ligand-based  in silico screening methods were tested experimentally using the plate assay described above. initial velocities were measured for the first 10 min of reaction, plotted , and then fitted to equation  <dig> to obtain ic <dig> values . we tested sm <dig> , rr <dig> and rr <dig> in the hts pnpp assay. triton x- <dig> was used in this assay  to disrupt any small molecule aggregates that could be formed. the ic <dig> for sm <dig> is  <dig>  mm, while for rr <dig> and rr <dig> is  <dig> and 16 mm respectively . collectively, these data suggest that sm <dig> or its analog mixture identified from the computational docking assay inhibit dusp <dig> in the mm ic <dig> range.fig.  <dig>

to identify molecules with similar shape and electrostatic properties to nts  , we subsequently searched a drugbank  <cit>   using rocs with the rr <dig> and nts structures. suramin was found as a match to the nts structure. indeed, suramin  is comprised of two nts substructures connected via a rigid linker, and is an fda approved drug that is used to treat african sleeping sickness  <cit> . initial velocity inhibition profiles of suramin were obtained by measuring initial velocities at varied concentrations of substrate  and inhibitor  . the inhibition profile fits best to the equation for competitive inhibition .  <dig> v=vmaxskm1+iki+s where v is the initial velocity, vmax is the maximum velocity, km is the michaelis constant, and  is the concentration of pnpp. the data were fitted to the equation for competitive inhibition, to give a ki of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . competitive inhibition suggests that inhibition occurs via specific blockage of the phosphatase active site . aggregation is often an issue with small molecules, so we investigated whether suramin aggregates in solution. to test for aggregation, the assay was repeated in the presence of triton x- <dig>  a detergent that is able to break up small molecule aggregates, while not significantly interfering with the assay  <cit> . nts  and suramin  inhibition was compared under identical conditions in the absence and presence of triton x- <dig>  results show that detergent decreases suramin inhibition, while it has no effect on nts inhibition. this indicates that at least some of suramin’s inhibition is due to aggregation, and that this tendency to aggregate is not an inherent property of just the polysulfonated aromatic group contained within the suramin molecule . but, while the level of inhibition due to suramin decreases in the presence of added detergent, it is not eliminated . this suggests that while suramin aggregates, at least some of its inhibition is not due to aggregation, consistent with the fact that suramin behaves as a competitive inhibitor .fig.  <dig>

we additionally confirmed the potential aggregating effects of suramin and other compounds using nephelometry methods. when an inflection occurs in the relative nephelometry units, measured as a function of compound concentration, this indicates that the particle size in solution is increasing, due to aggregating effects. rr <dig>  rr <dig>  nts, and suramin were subjected to nephelometry measurements . suramin appears to start forming aggregates around 25 μm, while rr <dig>  rr <dig> and nts do not appear to form aggregates. this is consistent with the triton x- <dig> studies that suggest that suramin inhibition, unlike nts, is at least partially due to aggregation effects.

identification of small molecule inhibitors based on distance between sulfates in the dusp <dig> pd active site
all compounds identified thus far have had two or more sulfonate groups on a polycyclic aromatic core structure. recognition of this common theme amongst ligands, and inspection of the active site pocket of the crystal structure of the human dusp <dig> pd  <cit> , led us to a hypothesis regarding the required pharmacophore features of dusp <dig> pd ligands. since the dusp <dig> pd crystal structure contains two sulfate ions in the active site pocket  in the regions suggested to be occupied by the di-phosphorylated substrate , and our ligands generally possessed at least two sulfonates , we reasoned that two such negatively charged moieties—appropriately positioned—are a necessary feature of any dusp <dig> pd inhibitor. to this end, a ligand-based search strategy based on the two bound sulfate ions was then pursued. these sulfate ions are positioned  <dig>  Å from each other , with one located where the phosphate to be cleaved would reside , proximal to the cys <dig> nucleophile . the other, termed s <dig>  is located  <dig>  Å away, in an arginine-rich pocket. overlay of compound rr <dig> with the s <dig> and s <dig> sulfates was less than optimal , while the nts overlay was better . a rocs search was made of all compounds in the csd <dig> internal collection for hits that had sulfonates in the proper s1;s <dig> location, and compound csd3_ <dig> was identified . this compound  is based on the simpler naphthalene core, and has an ic <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  in the phosphatase assay with dusp <dig> pd and using pnpp as substrate. but, in the more biologically relevant assay with full length dusp <dig> and using perk <dig> as substrate, the ic <dig> is in the range of 8–96 μm with a mean of 33 ± 21 μm . the 1d 1h nmr spectrum confirms that csd3_ <dig> is pure  and matches the expected structure; and, nephelometry indicates that it has no propensity to aggregate . nmr hsqc titration experiments  confirm direct binding to dusp <dig> pd, with several crosspeaks being shifted in the presence of csd3_ <dig>  when csd3_ <dig> is positioned in the model of the erk2-dusp <dig> complex  by overlaying the sulfonates on the phosphate groups of the erk <dig> activation loop, a close superposition is obtained that positions the phenolic ring of the csd3_ <dig> naphthalene core where the tyrosine would bind , with the hydroxyl group in the vicinity of where the incoming water nucleophile would be located, before attack on the substrate’s phosphate ester. csd3_ <dig> was also screened against a panel of  <dig> phosphatases and found to not inhibit any of them significantly at up to 30 μm .fig.  <dig>

discussion
docking and hts assay to identify polysulfated lead molecules
docking into the phosphatase domain  of the full-length dusp protein  and rocs alignment calculations have identified various polysulfonated aromatic compounds, with both carbazole and naphthalene scaffolds . in order to determine affinity of compounds identified using docking studies, an enzyme inhibition  assay was developed whereby dephosphorylation of pnpp is monitored. pnpp was found to be a substrate for dusp pd with a km of  <dig>  mm , apparently serving as a mimic of the natural substrate, the phospho-tyrosine of erk <dig>  the dusp <dig> pd ic <dig> assay using pnpp as substrate  was adapted, optimized and validated as a high throughput screening  assay, and was found to be suitable for hts with a z’ value >  <dig>  . enzymatic screening of compounds identified by docking identified a number of weak-binding polysulfonated inhibitors that could be used as drug lead scaffolds , off of which more potent lead molecules could be developed by rational drug design or by fragment-based drug design techniques, if proximal binding pockets can be identified.

lead-hopping to an fda approved drug and beyond
we have also employed a novel approach, to transition from initial lead molecules  to an advanced clinical candidate, by screening for fda approved compounds that match the shape and electronic properties of a lead molecule, using rocs. based on this rocs overlay, naphthalene trisulfonate  was found to match the shape and electronic properties of rr <dig> ; and, nts was found to be present in the suramin , an fda approved drug available from centers for disease control for treating african sleeping sickness  <cit> . suramin is a competitive inhibitor versus pnpp, binding with a ki of 25 μm .

while initially promising, suramin does not exhibit properties of a good drug lead molecule, even though it is fda approved. in particular, while suramin is a reasonably potent competitive inhibitor, it also causes non-specific aggregation. based on dusp <dig> pd ic <dig> assays performed with and without detergent , along with nephelometry studies , we conclude that while suramin does inhibit by direct binding to the phosphatase domain , it also forms aggregates in vitro which can lead to additional non-specific protein inhibition effects. this aggregation phenomenon raises more global concerns regarding the current clinical use of suramin, and may in part explain some of the known toxicity associated with suramin  <cit> . indeed, literature on suramin  indicates that it can bind to many protein targets, so may lack specificity in its mechanism of inhibition.

dusp <dig> inhibition vs. activation: implications for vascular anomalies
we identified the s147p mutation in dusp <dig> in patients with vascular anomalies  <cit> , which results in a mutant hypoactive protein  <cit> . this mutation thus presumably results in increased perk levels in the “putative causative cell,” whose identity is unknown for now. it is presumptive to imply that this mutation is causative because:  most diseases are not the result of a single aberration in a gene product,  single gene knockouts in mice and its subsequent phenotype does not necessarily imply causative role in disease, but perhaps the potential functions of the gene product in different tissues, and  finally, the etiology of disease, and the context of the mutation in the disease needs to reconciled, which is often not considered. for example, in vascular anomalies such as hemangiomas, which are thought to be inborn errors during embryonic development, there are two phases: the first phase is the increased proliferative phase or the rapid growth phase, and the second phase is the involution or the regression phase. the cellular dynamics, behavior and local milieu in the two phases are likely to be distinct. whether dusp <dig> functions in the early or later phase is not known. because the proliferative phase is the initial phase, and p-erk is involved in cell proliferation  <cit> , therefore the natural presumption is that dusp <dig> is involved in the first phase. therefore, our attempts to inhibit dusp <dig> could stop the disease in the first phase. however, if inhibiting dusp <dig> accelerates the disease in the first phase as the putative tumor suppressor role of dusp <dig> would suggest, then, perhaps the involution second phase of hemangiomas could be triggered earlier assuming that the two phases are linked by a common mechanism involving dusp <dig>  therefore, the benefit of inhibiting a “putative tumor suppressor,” such as dusp <dig>  and in turn accelerating the disease etiology to a phase where the disease regresses is counterintuitive. it is noteworthy that loss of dusp <dig> does increase apoptosis of endothelial cells  <cit> , suggesting that dusp <dig> as a survival factor for ecs. this perhaps occurs in the regression phase of the hemangioma disease. the debate as to whether to develop activators or inhibitors of dusp <dig> is therefore context dependent, and probably both have benefits in specific stages of disease. irrespective of the strategy, phosphatases as targets for drug discovery present their unique challenges as highlighted in the findings in this manuscript. although we rationalized on developing dusp <dig> inhibitors for vascular anomalies, it is becoming increasingly clear that dusp <dig> inhibitors could be viable for other conditions especially those associated with immune system. recent publications  <cit>  have demonstrated a role for dusp <dig> in the immune system. our unpublished work  also supports these findings. these studies together underscore the importance of dusp <dig> in a wide array of phenotypes in different tissue types, with likely more to be discovered in the future.

charge separation vs. distance hypothesis
while protein-based methods  have identified a series of weak binding polysulfonated lead molecules  for dusp <dig>  and lead-hopping with rocs has identified the fda-approved drug suramin, none of these are viable drug leads without further modification. thus, more lead molecules and analogs are needed. an interesting feature of all these weak-binding lead molecules is the presence of at least two charged sulfonates, separated by 6–9 Å . this led us to hypothesize that this trend is occurring because the active site pocket of dusp <dig> pd binds a peptide loop from erk <dig> containing two phosphates, so is designed to accommodate two negatively charged functionalities separated by this approximate distance. indeed, dusp <dig> pd was found to crystallize with two sulfate anions bound, at an s-s distance of  <dig>  Å . these observations led us to conclude that the key pharmacophore feature for dusp <dig> pd binding is two negatively charged groups . negatively charged functional groups are commonly observed on phosphatase inhibitors, but are also associated with poor ability to penetrate cell membranes. indeed, the polysulfonate compounds identified herein did not show activity in our preliminary assays using human umbilical vein endothelial  cells, which we speculate is due to their inability to penetrate cell membranes. thus, future studies will be directed to substituting the sulfonates with functional groups that are more likely to penetrate into cells, such as carboxylates, tetrazoles or sulfonamides. using this pharmacophore feature of two negatively charged groups separated by  <dig>  Å in a ligand-based screen, a naphthalene-based disulfonate compound, csd3_ <dig>  was identified . csd3_ <dig> has an ic <dig> of only 33 mm if assayed using the phosphatase domain alone , but 33 μm if assayed using the full-length dusp <dig> with erk <dig> as substrate . csd3_ <dig> is unique, in that it is the only compound tested that showed such a dramatic difference in ic <dig> values when measured in the two assays, indicating that it is especially sensitive to conformational differences that may exist in the binding site pocket in the full length versus the isolated phosphatase domain. supporting this argument is the fact that the full length dusp <dig> protein also contains an erk binding domain, tethered via a flexible linker . also, the native substrate for dusp <dig>  namely the erk <dig> protein, is much larger and capable of a wider range of inter-molecular interactions than the pnpp substrate, which is intended only to mimic the phosphotyrosine of perk. thus, while the dusp <dig> pd/pnpp assay is a useful preliminary screen, a subsequent assay using full-length dusp <dig> and erk <dig> substrate provides the in vitro “physiologically relevant” assessment of potency for a lead molecule. importantly, csd3_ <dig> shows no tendency to aggregate. thus, the  <dig> – <dig>  Å—separated disulfonate is a consistent pharmacophore feature for inhibition of the dusp <dig> pd , which shows some dependence on the presence of intact dusp <dig> protein versus use of just the phosphatase domain. these and other features are part of ongoing studies to further improve the potency of csd3_ <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this study illustrates the challenges associated with structure-based drug design applied to dual-specificity phosphatases, which have a preference for highly charged ligands. screening results presented herein typically yielded polysulfonated aromatic compounds with charged groups separated by ~ <dig>  Å, and included the fda-approved drug suramin . while polysulfonated aromatic compounds often aggregate like suramin, careful secondary screens using nephelometry and detergent have allowed for the identification of authentic competitive inhibitors, such as csd3_ <dig>  the potency of csd3_ <dig> under the more biologically relevant conditions of the dusp <dig> /perk <dig> assay is 33 μm. csd3_2320’s sulfonate groups are positioned 7 Å apart, to mimic the two phosphates on the erk <dig> tripeptide substrate . csd3_ <dig> is a suitable scaffold upon which to build more potent and selective dusp <dig> inhibitors; but, in any such inhibitor optimization effort, it will be crucial to perform secondary assays using the full-length dusp <dig> protein, and using nephelometry and detergent screens to eliminate compounds that show the nonspecific aggregation effects common to sulfonates.
