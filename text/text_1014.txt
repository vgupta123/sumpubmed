BACKGROUND
tilapia  are among the most important species in aquaculture and a primary source of animal protein for millions of people in the developing world  <cit> . only limited efforts have been made toward genetic improvement of these species  <cit> . the sequence of the tilapia genome will be a fundamental resource used for genetic selection, on traits such as growth performance and disease resistance, to create strains of fish optimized for the unique culture conditions of each country.

tilapia and other closely related species of african cichlid fishes are also widely used in basic research. because of their intimate physiological relationship with the environment, tilapia are ideal for studies of ion regulation  <cit> , the accumulation of heavy metals  <cit> , and detoxification of biotoxins  <cit> . nile tilapia expressing a humanized insulin gene are being studied as a source of islet cells which might be transplanted into humans for control of type i diabetes  <cit> . tilapia are also an important model for studying environmental influences on sex differentiation  <cit> . the closely related haplochromine cichlids of the east african lakes are a model system for studying the genetic basis of behavior  <cit>  and evolutionary processes of adaptation and speciation  <cit> .

cichlid genomics
considerable progress has been made in developing genomic resources for tilapia and other east african cichlid fishes. genetic maps have been published for tilapia  <cit> , lake malawi haplochromines  <cit> , and astatotilapia burtoni  <cit> . there are also extensive collections of ests for lake victoria haplochromines  <cit> , a. burtoni  <cit>  and nile tilapia  <cit> . several bac libraries have been constructed for nile tilapia  <cit> , and fingerprinted to construct a physical map  <cit> . bac libraries have been constructed also for haplochromine cichlids from lakes malawi  <cit> , victoria  <cit>  and tanganyika  <cit> .

comparative physical maps
comparative maps have been a useful intermediate resource for many agricultural species before complete genome sequences were available  <cit> . most often these comparative maps have relied on mapping homologous gene markers in radiation hybrid panels  <cit> , but comparative maps have also been based on analysis of bac end sequences  <cit> . until a complete genome sequence is available for tilapia, comparative maps to the genome sequences of model fish species will provide the best organization of the partial sequence data for cichlid fishes.

the utility of a comparative map is proportional to the extent to which synteny exists between the two genomes. useful comparative maps have been constructed between cattle and human  <cit> . the divergence among many fish lineages is much older, creating the potential for more extensive genome rearrangements. the ostariophysi  and acanthopterygii  diverged ~300my ago  <cit> . divergence among percomorph groups  occurred more than 100my ago  <cit> . the utility of comparative maps across these greater evolutionary distances is not yet clear.

early research suggested that the rate of chromosome evolution is relatively low in non-mammalian vertebrates  <cit> . recently it has been suggested that the rate of chromosomal rearrangement increases immediately after episodes of whole-genome duplication  <cit> . teleost fishes experienced an additional round of whole genome duplication about  <dig> my ago  <cit> , and recent papers have suggested that fishes continue to have a high rate of chromosomal rearrangement  <cit> . however, the more extensive inter-chromosomal rearrangements detected in the zebrafish genome may be due to unique evolutionary processes in that lineage, and there appear to have been no major inter-chromosomal rearrangements in the medaka genome during the last 300my  <cit> . the green pufferfish shows relatively little inter-chromosomal rearrangement since divergence from the ancestral bony vertebrate  <cit> . most of the changes in the pufferfish lineage represent fusions that reduced the chromosome number after whole genome duplications.

the goal of the present study was to construct a comparative physical map between tilapia and the latest sequence assemblies for three other percomorph species: stickleback, medaka and pufferfish. from this comparative map we estimate the extent of chromosomal rearrangement during the recent evolution of these species.

RESULTS
new bac library
the bac library  constructed at the benaroya research institute consists of  <dig>  clones  with an average insert size of  <dig> kb. this represents a total of  <dig> gbp or approximately 10× coverage of the tilapia genome. the methods used to prepare this library are presented in additional file  <dig> 

sequencing statistics
genoscope
the construction of the bac libraries sequenced at genoscope was reported previously  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  clones from these libraries , have been restriction fingerprinted and assembled into  <dig>  contigs  <cit> . genoscope end sequenced a total of  <dig>  clones . from  <dig>  clones, a total of  <dig>  end sequences were obtained, representing  <dig> × clone coverage of the genome. the mean trimmed length of the sequences was  <dig>  bp, for a total dataset of  <dig> , <dig> bp representing  <dig> % sequence coverage of the genome.

broad
the broad institute end sequenced  <dig>  clones  from the benaroya library, obtaining a sequence for at least one end of  <dig>  clones, representing  <dig> × clone coverage of the genome. multiple attempts were made to sequence some clones and therefore, a total of  <dig>  end sequences were finally submitted to genbank. the mean length of the sequences was  <dig>  bp, for a dataset of  <dig> , <dig> bp. after quality trimming and vector removal with lucy, a total of  <dig>  sequences remained, with a mean length of  <dig>  bp, for a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp, representing  <dig> % sequence coverage of the genome. these sequences were previously analyzed for their repeat content  <cit> .

microsatellites
microsatellite motifs were identified in  <dig>   of the  <dig>  sequences. these included  <dig>  dinucleotide,  <dig>  trinucleotide, and  <dig> tetranucleotide repeats . over half of the repeats  were ac dinucleotides. at and ag dinucleotides were also abundant. aat was the most frequent trinucleotide. these microsatellites could be exploited to develop new genetic markers and could be used to anchor the fpc-based physical map  <cit>  to the genetic map  <cit> .

genes
a total of  <dig>   repeat-masked sequences had a significant  blastx hit to the uniprot database. we found that  <dig>   of the repeat-masked sequences had a significant  blastn hit to the  <dig>  nile tilapia est set  <cit> . therefore,  <dig>   of the sequences had either a significant blastx hit to uniprot or a significant blastn hit to the nile tilapia ests. there were  <dig>   sequences that had a significant hit to both uniprot and the nile tilapia ests.

comparative mapping
a total of  <dig>  bac end sequences were blasted against the genome assemblies of stickleback, medaka and pufferfish. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  the proportion of sequences that had hits with e-values less than e- <dig> ranged from  <dig> percent against pufferfish,  <dig> percent against medaka and  <dig> percent against stickleback. twenty-eight percent of the bacs had at least one hit to the stickleback genome assembly.

*numbers for type  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> do not include hits to the contigs in the 'unordered chromosome' of each genome assembly. type  <dig> hits were scored when the two end sequences of a clone hit within  <dig> kb of each other in the target genome.

we classified the bacs into one of four types, according to the pattern of blast hit. type  <dig> clones are those for which only a single sequence produced a hit in the target genome. type  <dig> clones are those in which the sequences from the two ends of the bac hit in the appropriate opposing orientation within  <dig> kb in the target genome. type  <dig> clones are those in which the two end sequences of a bac hit the same chromosome in the target genome outside of the  <dig> kb range. type  <dig> bacs are those in which the two sequences hit different chromosomes in the target genome.

since the average blast hit rate against the stickleback genome is 17%, we expected the proportion of clones with hits on both ends would be  <dig> %. in fact we observed a slightly greater proportion , possibly reflecting a clustering of conserved sequences in the genomes. when both ends of a bac had blast hits, they were most often found within  <dig> kb on the same chromosome in the target genome . a much smaller proportion  were found at larger distances on the same chromosome in the target genome .

conservation of gene order
we can use the ratios of type  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hits  to estimate the number of rearrangements between genomes. across the three species, 27-41% of double hit clones are type  <dig> or  <dig>  if the bac clone inserts average  <dig> kb, and every third clone has a break in synteny, it would suggest a breakpoint every  <dig> ×  <dig> kb =  <dig> kb across the genome. this is equivalent to more than  <dig> breakpoints across the genome, or about  <dig> breakpoints per chromosome. we suspect this simple statistic overestimates the true number of chromosomal rearrangements.

the best estimate of intra-chromosomal rearrangements is the number of type  <dig> bacs relative to the number of type  <dig> + type  <dig> bacs. this proportion is between  <dig> and 6%, suggesting an intra-chromosomal rearrangement every  <dig> ×  <dig> kb =  <dig> mb. if the average chromosome is  <dig> mb, this suggests about  <dig> breakpoints  per chromosome. we detected a mean of  <dig>  breakpoints per chromosome, with at least one rearrangement on each stickleback chromosome . the observed breakpoints were spanned by an average of  <dig>  bac clones. unfortunately, the relatively low clone coverage of the type  <dig> bacs does not allow us to identify all of the likely breakpoints, or precisely map their locations. still, the high end of these estimates  suggests there have been only  <dig> inversions since the divergence of tilapia and stickleback. the type  <dig> hits are visualized in circos plots in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  figures s1-s <dig> 

type  <dig> bacs are possible evidence of inter-chromosomal rearrangements, and represent 24-37% of the two-hit bacs. this might suggest more than  <dig> breakpoints in synteny for each chromosome. however, we do not think this statistic is an indication of a large number of inter-chromosomal transfers of genes. rather, it probably includes many instances in which one of the blast matches is to a paralog on a second chromosome. for example, if the syntenic copy of the gene has been lost, blast will identify a paralog on another chromosome as the best hit. this kind of gene loss is a common feature of fish genomes, which underwent a whole-genome duplication about 300my ago. alternate loss of even a small proportion of genes from these duplicated regions would be sufficient to create the pattern. there are about  <dig>  genes/chromosome, and if only 5% of them  were deleted after the whole genome duplication, it would be sufficient to create the pattern we see in the bac data. the fact that type  <dig> blast hits have much lower e-values than type  <dig> blast hits  tends to reinforce this view.

we mapped the rearrangements onto a phylogeny of the four species. the results suggest that approximately 15- <dig> rearrangements have occurred on each lineage since they diverged from their common ancestor. there is no indication that the rate of rearrangement is higher in one lineage than another.

comparative physical maps
these blast results are displayed in a gbrowse interface at http://www.bouillabase.org . separate tracks display the type  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> blast hits. an additional track displays the blast hits from each of the fingerprint contigs in the previous physical map  <cit> . because these fpc contigs contain multiple bac clones, they help to tie the physical map together at larger scales than the end sequences of individual clones.

CONCLUSIONS
end-sequencing of these bac libraries was a key step in preparing the tilapia genome for shotgun sequencing. together with the bac fingerprint database, these sequences will provide long-range structure for scaffolding the contigs of genome assemblies to construct a golden path across the genome.

recent molecular phylogenies appear to have reached a consensus that cichlids are more closely related to medaka than to either pufferfish or stickleback  <cit> . nevertheless, a higher number of the tilapia bac end sequences hit stickleback  than either medaka  or pufferfish . this discrepancy might be due to variation in the quality of each assembly, or it might support an alternative phylogenetic reconstruction. regardless, it appears that the stickleback sequence is currently the best reference sequence for building comparative maps of tilapia  <cit> .

finally, these data suggest that chromosomal evolution in recent teleosts is dominated by alternate loss of gene duplicates, and by intra-chromosomal rearrangements. the rate of these rearrangements is relatively slow, on the order of one per million years. so the prospects are good for building useful comparative maps between sequenced genomes and the large number of as yet unsequenced teleost species of commercial or scientific importance.
