BACKGROUND

lysinibacillus sphaericus is a spore-forming bacterium widely distributed in soil and other environment. l. sphaericus can metabolize a large variety of organic compounds and amino acids but cannot utilize polysaccharide because of absence of key enzymes in glycolysis  <cit> . the classifications of l. sphaericus were mainly based on flagellar agglutination and dna typing,  <dig> serotypes  <cit>  and five major dna groups   <cit>  have been identified. among them, nine serotypes  can produce different types of insecticidal proteins against mosquito larvae: the binary toxin  and two-component toxin  formed during sporulation, and mosquitocidal toxins  produced during the vegetative growth . several typing methods, e.g. 16s rrna and mlst analysis, revealed that the mosquitocodal l. sphaericus are highly conserved.  <cit> . in addition, comparative genomics revealed that toxic strains form a well-defined lineage that could be considered as a separate species from non-toxic strain  <cit> .

even l. sphaericus has been successfully applied as bacterial pesticide for mosquito larvae control, the relative narrow spectrum and the occurrence of high-level resistance in target mosquitoes in field hindered its further utilization in integrated mosquito management program . therefore, there is a great demand to construct genetic engineered l. sphaericus with broader active spectrum and higher activity. besides, being an archaic organism and one of the minor bacterial species unable to metabolize carbohydrates, l. sphaericus is regarded as a good model strain for studying bacterial genetic evolution and metabolism regulation. however, the difficulty of horizontal transfer of foreign dna and the unavailability of genetic manipulations in many high toxic l. sphaericus strains limited the related study  <cit> . moreover, genomic analysis among some sequenced strains revealed a high dna homology, especially the identical binary toxin genes identified from the strains isolated from different continents, and the reason for this high conservation remains unclear. we make a hypothesis that after one l. sphaericus lineage acquired mosquitocidal toxin genes, it developed restriction-modification  systems which prevent the invasion of foreign dna.

to maintain species identity, most bacteria encode r-m systems to prevent the invasion of foreign dna  <cit> . the r-m systems usually consist of a dna methyltransferase  and a restriction endonuclease , which serve to methylate self dna and restrictly cleave invading unmethylated dna with the same specificity sequence, respectively  <cit> . the r-m system can build complex genetic barriers for unrecognized dna, resulting in the difficulty for genetic manipulations, e.g. transformation, transfection and conjugation. there are four r-m system groups , classfied based on their enzyme compositions, cofactors and activity modes and of which the type ii r-m system is the most abundant  <cit> . most of the type ii r-m system consist of separate rease and mtase, functioned as counterpart pair by recognizing the same and normally palindromic dna sequence  <cit> .


l. sphaericus c3– <dig> is a commercialized highly toxic strain isolated from a mosquito breeding site in china in  <dig>  a c3– <dig> liquid formulation  has been successfully applied for urban mosquito larvae control for more than two decades in china and good control efficacy has been recorded. the complete genome of c3– <dig> has been sequenced and the molecular basis of toxin synthesis and metabolism regulation have been elucidated  <cit> . in this study, six type ii r-m systems were predicted in l. sphaericus c3– <dig>  of which lspc3–41i was found to play a key role in the genetic manipulations and identified as a major determinant for the genetic restriction of l. sphaericus. the study helps for understanding of the biologial restriction and modification phenomenon and for developing better genetic engineering tools and techniques for l. sphaericus.

cell free extracts  preparation and restriction assay

l. sphaericus strains were grown in lb at 30 °c with shaking at 200 rpm until mid-exponential phase. the cells were harvested and washed twice with deionized water, and resuspended in one-third volume of tnm buffer . bacterial cell suspensions were sonicated on ice using ultrasonic processor at tapered microtip  and then centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 5 min at 4 °c. supernatants as cfe were collected, and stored at −70 °c. for restriction assays, cfe was diluted 1: <dig> in tnm buffer and aliquots of 20 μl cfe were mixed with 500 ng plasmid and incubated for 2 h at 37 °c. the reaction mixture was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and southern blot analysis.

in vitro methylation
in vitro methylation was performed by treated with cfe or commercial mtase. 5 μg plasmid dna was mixed with 20 μl cfe in a reaction buffer with tnm buffer , 30 mm edta  and 200 μm sam , of which the edta was used to inhibit the restriction of cfe, and sam to provide methyl. the methylation with commercial mtase m. haeiii  was processed according to the recommended protocol by the manufacturer. as a control, plasmid dna was mock treated in a reaction mixture without cfe or m. haeiii. all samples were incubated at 37 °c for 2 h. m. haeiii was heat inactivated at 65 °c for 20 min and removed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction as described previously  <cit> , then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

creation of l. sphaericus mutants
all oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  for disruption of the predicted lspc3–41ir gene , an upstream  and downstream  fragment of bsph_ <dig> were amplified from the l. sphaericus genome using primer pairs 0498la-f/0498la-r and 0498ra-f/0498ra-r, respectively. the kan gene was amplified from plasmid pxk using primer pair kan-f/kan-r as described  <cit> . the 0498-a, kan, and 0498-b fragments were digested with sali/bamhi, bamhi/kpni, and kpni/nhei, respectively, and cloned between the sali and nhei sites in the temperature-sensitive plasmid prn <dig>  yielding plasmid prn-m <dig>  following in vitro methlylation using the commercial methyltransferase m. haeiii, prn-m <dig> was electroporated into l. sphaericus c3– <dig> to make the mutant Δ <dig>  to complement bsph_ <dig>  a recombinant plasmid prn-c <dig> was constructed which contains the intact bsph_ <dig> including its native promoter  and a spc gene and the flanking sequences of amye  as described previously  <cit> . following in vitro methlylation using the commercial mtase m. haeiii, prn-c <dig> was electroporated into l. sphaericus mutant Δ <dig> table  <dig> oligonucleotides used in this study

the l. sphaericus mutant Δ <dig> and complement strain rc <dig> were generated by homologous recombination according to heat treated method described previously based on the temperature sensitive character of prn <dig>  <cit> . the correct mutant and complement strains were screened by resistance and confirmed by pcr analysis.

dna probe labeling and hybridizations
a standard procedure described before was carried out for southern blot analysis  <cit> . briefly, the purified dna were separated on  <dig> % agarose gel, and blotted to a positively-charged nylon membrane. the plasmid pbu <dig> was first linearized with haeiii and then labeled with dig to be used as dna probe. the dna labeling, hybridization, and detection were carried out using dig high prime dna labeling and detection starter kit i , according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

measurement of plasmid transformation efficiency
the competent cells of l. sphaericus strains were prepared as the method described before  <cit> . to measure the transformation efficiency, 10 ng methylated or unmethylated shuttle vector pbu <dig> was added to 100 μl competent cells of l. sphaericus c3– <dig> or its derivative mutants and kept on ice for 30 min. the vector was introduced into competent cells of l. sphaericus strains by electroporation , and 1 ml lb was immediately added into the electroporated cells and incubated for 2 h at 30 °c, 100 rpm. the transformants were selected on lb solid plates with 10 μg/ml tetracycline and incubated overnight. the number of the colonies was counted, and the transformation efficiency was presented as transformants/μg. the data were expressed as the mean transformation efficiency from three independent experiments.

RESULTS
six r-m systems were predicted in l. sphaericus c3–41
rebase analyses against the whole genome sequences of l. sphaericus c3– <dig> exhibited the presence of six gene clusters related with type ii r-m systems , in which three  are located on chromosome, whereas the other three  on a large plasmid pbsph. it was found that bsph_ <dig>  bsph_ <dig> and bsph_ <dig> encode proteins of a complete r-e system, of which bsph_ <dig> and bsph_ <dig> were predicted to encode mtase and rease, showing 61% and 33% identities to the corresponding components  of bspri system, respectively. bspri is an isoschizomer of haeiii, both belongs to the pd- xk nuclease superfamily. the m. bspri and r. bspri pair recognize the same double-stranded sequence ggcc, of which m. bspri causes specific methylation and protects the dna from cleavage by its counterpart r. bspri  <cit> . there are mtases but no rease homologs predicted in the other five gene clusters related with type ii r-m systems. when mtases exist alone, they were believed to be mainly involved in the functions related with regulation other than with restriction barrier  <cit> . this suggested that bsph_ <dig> , encoding the putative r. lspc3–41i, might be an important determinant for the restriction barrier of l. sphaericus c3– <dig> fig.  <dig> organization of the predicted gene clusters related with restriction-modification system in the genomic region of l. sphaericus c3– <dig>  three systems  are located on chromosome , whereas the other three  are located on the large plasmid pbsph . the predicted endonuclese r. lspc3–41i encoding by bsph_ <dig> was underlined




pbu <dig> was digested by cfe of l. sphaericus c3–41
to investigate if the r-m systems of l. sphaericus c3– <dig> are functional, the e. coli-bacillus shuttle vector pbu <dig> isolated from e. coli jm <dig> was incubated with the cfe of l. sphaericus c3– <dig>  furthermore, since r. lspc3–41i is the only predicted rease of c3– <dig> and it is an isoschizomer of haeiii, pbu <dig> was also incubated with commercial restriction endonuclease haeiii as a control. restriction profile and southern blot analysis showed that plasmid mixed with cfe was completely digested, displaying the similar profile with that treated with commercial restriction endonuclease haeiii . the result suggested that the r-m systems of c3– <dig>  probably r. lspc3–41i, played a restriction role on the exogenous dna. in addition, it was observed that the genomic dna of c3– <dig> can be digested by hindiii but not by haeiii . this suggested that the intrinsic dna have been methylated by the m. lspc3–41i and thus resistant to haeiii as they recognize the same site. the results confirmed that cfe from l. sphaericus could digest exogenous dna but not intrinsic dna due to the strain specific modification systems.fig.  <dig> the restriction and methylation role of l. sphaericus c3– <dig> cfe. a restriction profile of pbu <dig>  and southern blot analysis of the restriction of pbu <dig> using linear pbu <dig> as the probe . lane  <dig>  pbu <dig> mock treated; lane  <dig>  pbu <dig> digested by haeiii; lane  <dig>  pbu <dig> digested by c3– <dig> cfe; lane  <dig>  pbu <dig> methylated with c3– <dig> cfe; lane  <dig>  pbu <dig> methylated with c3– <dig> cfe and then digested by haeiii. b restriction assays of l. sphaericus c3– <dig> chromosome. lane  <dig>  chromosome mock treated; lane  <dig>  chromosome digested by haeiii; lane  <dig>  chromosome digested by hindiii. m: dna marker




Δ <dig> cannot digest unmethylated pbu4
a mutant with bsph_ <dig> knockout  and its complement strain rc <dig> were constructed. restriction profile and southern blot showed that the unmethylated pbu <dig> can be digested by c3– <dig> cfe but not by Δ <dig> cfe, whereas the cfe of the complement strain rc <dig> restored the cleaving capability against pbu <dig> and showed the same digested profile with the wild . nevertheless, after methylated by cfe or m. haeiii, the plasmid became resistant to the cfe of all the three strains . the results suggested that r. lspc3–41i should be a major determinant for the restriction barrier against exogenous dna in l. sphaericus c3– <dig> fig.  <dig> the effect of bsph_ <dig>  on the restriction role of l. sphaericus c3– <dig> cfe. untreated and pre-treated plasmid pbu <dig> was incubated with cfe and then subjected to restriction assays, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as show in the left three pictures  and southern blot analysis as show in the right three pictures . a untreated pbu <dig>  lane  <dig>  c3–41; lane  <dig>  Δ0498; lane  <dig>  rc0498; lane  <dig>  haeiii digested; lane  <dig>  untreated. b pbu <dig> methylated with c3– <dig> cfe. lane  <dig>  c3–41; lane  <dig>  Δ0498; lane  <dig>  rc0498; lane  <dig>  haeiii digested; lane  <dig>  untreated. c pbu <dig> methylated with mtase m. haeiii. lane  <dig>  c3–41; lane  <dig>  Δ0498; lane  <dig>  rc0498; lane  <dig>  haeiii digested; lane  <dig>  untreated. m: dna marker




both methylated and unmethylated pbu <dig> can be transformed efficiently into Δ0498
the methylated and unmethylated pbu <dig> were electroporated into c3– <dig>  Δ <dig> and rc <dig>  as expected, the unmethylated pbu <dig> was successfully transferred into △ <dig> but not into c3– <dig>  with similar transformation efficiency to that when the methylated pbu <dig> transferred into c3– <dig>  . the unmethylated plasmid was also able to be transformed into the complement strain rc <dig>  but in a much lower efficiency . therefore, the complementation of the r. lspc3–41i cannot completely build a barrier for the foreign dna. the reason remains unclear, probably due to the low copies and instability of the prn-vector. all the three strains, c3– <dig>  Δ <dig> and rc <dig> can accept methylated pbu <dig> with c3– <dig> cfe or m. haeiii, with similar efficiencies  . the results suggest that r. lspc3–41i is indeed the major determinant for the restriction barrier of c3– <dig> and in vitro methylation can overcome the restriction barrier and increase the transformation efficiency of l. sphaericus c3– <dig> and its derived mutants.fig.  <dig> the transformation frequencies of pbu <dig> into l. sphaericus c3– <dig> and its derivate mutants. light gray column: pbu <dig> untreated; deep gray column: pbu <dig> methylated with c3– <dig> cfe; black column: pbu <dig> methylated with mtase m. haeiii. *, no transformant observed




lspc3–41i system is only found in l. sphaericus belonging to the serotype h <dig> and mlst type st1
the unmethylated pbu <dig> was mixed with the cfe of 16 l. sphaericus strains, representing  <dig> serotypes and  <dig> mlst sequence types  <cit> , respectively. the agarose gel displayed that the cfe of nine strains can partially or completely digest pbu <dig>  whereas the other seven cannot . besides c3– <dig>  only  <dig> and  <dig>  all belonging to the serotype h <dig> and mlst st <dig>  are pcr positive to lspc3–41ir and lspc3–41im genes. furthermore, using the host cfe or m. haeiii to treat pbu <dig> can make  <dig> and  <dig> become transformable as well as c3– <dig> . based on the reported complete genome sequence of  <dig> , they have no transformation capability. one possibility is that there are other unknown r-m systems in these strains which cannot recognize the sequence of pbu <dig> in the tested buffer. indeed, the presence of different types of restriction endonucleases in l. sphaericus was reported. for instance, baei recognizes  acnnnngtayc  requiring both mg2+ and adomet to cleave dna  <cit> , bsii is not an isoschizomer of any known restriction endonucleases which recognizes non-palindromic nucleotide sequence c1tcgtg  <cit> . besides r-m systems, a recent report clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat -cas can also prevent the invasion of foreign dna by acquired immunity  <cit> . although most l. sphaericus are hard to be genetically manipulated, there are three strains  which are naturally deficient in restriction enzymes have the transformation capability without foreign dna modification . this is consistent with our previous experiences that  <dig> and nrs <dig> are capable of genetic manipulations, not only for pbu <dig> but also for many other heterogenous recombinant plasmids.fig.  <dig> the restriction profile of pbu <dig> by the cfe of 16 l. sphaericus. plasmid dna was mixed with l. sphaericus cfe and the reaction mixture was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. m: dna marker




CONCLUSIONS
in this study, six type ii r-m systems were predicted in l. sphaericus c3– <dig> genome, of which lspc3–41ir  is the only predicted rease encoding gene. the cfe from l. sphaericus c3– <dig>  on one hand can digest exogenous bacillus/e. coli shuttle vector pbu <dig>  on the other hand can methylate the same plasmid in vitro in a methyl-buffer. lspc3–41i was identified as the major determinant for the restriction barrier of l. sphaericus c3– <dig>  only three strains of the tested 16 l. sphaericus strains, which all belonging to serotype h <dig> and st <dig> by mlst scheme, contain lspc3–41i system. two different methods can be used to overcome the restriction barrier of the three isolates to get transformants efficiently: 1) to methylate plasmid dna prior to the electroporation; and 2) to delete the major restriction endonuclease encoding gene lspc3–41ir. the function of the other five r-e systems in c3– <dig> remains unclear. our previous studies have showed that the genomes of mosquitocidal l. sphaericus isolates are highly conserved, and hypothesized that the timescale of divergence between mosquitocidal and non-mosquitocidal strains of l. sphaericus should be large  <cit> . we have also indicated that the mosquitocidal toxin genes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer  due to the relationship between the mobile genetic elements  and the toxin genes  <cit> . it is hypothesized that the r-m systems in l. sphaericus be developed after one lineage acquired mosquitocidal genes by hgt, and then genetic barriers be build for the toxic l. sphaericus to accept foreign dna and therefore make them conserved.
