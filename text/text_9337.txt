BACKGROUND
ros are constantly generated under normal conditions as a consequence of aerobic metabolism, and the most common ros types are superoxide anions , hydrogen peroxide  and hydroxyl radicals 
 <cit> . ros can react with dna, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids in a destructive manner due to their high levels of chemical reactivity. ros participate in the modulation of apoptosis following treatment with various agents including fas, ultraviolet, and chemotherapeutic drugs
 <cit> . several previous studies also indicated involvement of ros in cadmium-induced renal tubular injury. for example, exposure of llc-pk <dig> cells to cadmium caused generation of ros
 <cit> , which was associated with a decrease in glutathione levels and consequent cellular death
 <cit> . another report showed that cd-triggered apoptosis of tubular cells is inhibited by an antioxidant
 <cit> .

however, currently, it is unknown whether and how oxidative stress is linked to er stress and, if so, what kind of ros are involved in the induction of apoptosis in cadmium-exposed cells. gadd <dig> is a member of the c/ebp family of bzip transcription factors, and its expression is induced to high levels by er stress
 <cit> . gadd <dig> forms hetero-dimers with other c/ebp-family transcription factors via bzip-domain interactions, which suppresses their binding to c/ebp sites in dna, while promoting binding to alternative dna sequences for target gene activation
 <cit> . consequently, gadd <dig> inhibits expression of genes responsive to c/ebp-family transcription factors, while enhancing expression of other genes containing the consensus motif 5′-tgcaatccc-3′. one relevant target may be bcl <dig>  whose expression is suppressed by gadd <dig>  at least in some cellular contexts
 <cit> . while capable of inducing apoptosis and contributing to cell death in several scenarios involving er stress, gadd <dig> is not essential for cell death induced by er stress, as demonstrated by the observation that perk−/− and eif2α knock-in cells are hypersensitive to er stress–induced apoptosis but fail to induce gadd <dig> gene expression
 <cit> . splenic lymphocytes from gadd153−/− mice are relatively resistant to lps-induced apoptosis, which is associated with increased bax and bak mrnas and decreased bcl- <dig> mrna . furthermore, the activation of gadd <dig> leads to translocation of bax protein from the cytosol to the mitochondria
 <cit> . thus, gadd153-mediated death signal is finally transmitted to the mitochondria, which functions as an integrator and amplifier of the death pathway.

clearly, there is great need for more definitive evidence of the involvement of gadd <dig> in apoptosis. in this study, we sought to define in greater detail what role, if any, gadd153/bak plays in the regulation of cell death. we report that while gadd <dig> expression alone does not trigger cell death, it does sensitize cells to killing by agents that stress the er. furthermore, we demonstrate that elevated gadd <dig> expression up-regulates expression of bak and the primary intracellular scavenger of ros.

RESULTS
cd induces apoptosis of neuronal cells through ros
cd induces the production of ros
 <cit>  and er stress, which are importa nt triggers of the stress response in many cell types
 <cit> . previous report indicated involvement of ros in cd-induced renal cell injury
 <cit> . to examine whether cd trigger ros in neuroblastoma cells, we investigated effects of cd on the generation of endogenous ros. exposure of sh-sy5y cells to cd led to both  <dig>  to  <dig> fold increase in intracellular ros levels in a doses and time dependent manner . to examine whether the generation of ros is causative of cd-induced apoptosis, cells were pretreated with antioxidant n-acetylcysteine and subjected to fluorescent microscopy and dapi staining .

increased cytoplasmic calcium [ca2+ resulted either from calcium  influx from the extracellular environment or efflux from intracellular er stores is associated with the initiation of apoptosis in diverse in vivo and in vitro systems
 <cit> . to investigate the role of intracellular [ca2+ in cd-induced ros generation, cells were pretreated for  <dig> hr with the ca2+ chelator bapta-am  before treatment with  <dig> μm cd treatment, cd-induced ros level is not changed . in addition, bapta-am is not effective in cd-induced apop-tosis . this indicates that ros generation is not consistent with intracellular [ca2+.

cd increases gadd <dig> and bak expression via ros
cd induced apoptosis of sh-sy5y cell is mediated, at least in part, by er stress
 <cit> . dose dependent experiment revealed that induction of gadd <dig> was observed from  <dig> um to  <dig> um cd treatment . the activation of gadd <dig> leads to translocation of this transcription factor from the cytosol to the nucleus. therefore, we examined the level of gadd <dig> after cd treatment in nuclear extract. as shown figure
2b, the level of gadd <dig> in nuclear extract is increased by cd. to investigate relationship between oxidative stress and er stress, sh-sy5y cells were treated with cd in the absence or presence of nac, and expression of endogenous er stress marker gadd <dig> was examined. western blot analysis revealed that induction of gadd <dig> by cd is completely attenuated by nac .

the cdna array screen also identified the pro-apoptotic bcl <dig> family protein bak as a fenretinide-inducible gene in sh-sy5y cells, and this is confirmed by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and western blot data
 <cit> . studies on other cell types have shows that bak can induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, independently of mitochondria permeability transition, in combination with bh <dig> domain-only members of the bl <dig> family
 <cit> . therefore, the induction of bak may be an event downstream of gadd <dig> induction leading to cytochrome c release and subsequent apoptosis in cd-treated neuroblastoma cells.

to exclude a possibility that gadd <dig> is not located downstream of bak, sh-sy5y cells were treated with cd in the absence or presence of nac and expression of endogenous bak was examined. western blot analysis revealed that induction of bak by cd was partially attenuated by nac . exposure of sh-sy5y cells to cd led to increase in intracellular bax levels in a doses dependent manner . these findings indicate that the gadd/bak pathway plays a apoptosis role in cd-induced cell death in sh-sy5y cells.

knockdown of gadd <dig> downregulates cd-induced apoptosis via bak
several studies have proposed that gadd <dig> activation results is apoptosis
 <cit> . to investigate the role of gadd <dig> in cd-induced apoptosis in sh-sy5y cells, cells were transfected with small interfering rna  targeted against the gadd <dig> coding region and then treated with cd . as demonstrated in the literature, activation of bak by cd is decreased by knockdown of gadd <dig> . cd-induced apoptosis is decreased in gadd <dig> knockdown cells compared with control cell .

chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals gadd <dig> binding to the bak promoter
to examine whether gadd <dig> increases bak mrna expression at the transcriptional level, we performed luciferase reporter gene assay. to localize the region of the bak promoter responsible for gadd <dig> induction, the effects of serial deletion on bak luciferase activity were analyzed in sh-sy5y cells. treatment with cd and gadd <dig> bak luciferase activity  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold under the control of the − <dig>  bp region versus the vector-transfected control, indicating that induction-fold decreased in the rest of untranslated region of bak promoter .

to study the mechanism of gadd <dig> to activate cd- induced bak transcription mediated transcription factors, the effect of gadd <dig> on the binding of c/ebp to the bak promoters were analyzed chip assay in sh-sy5y cells. as shown figure
4c, basal constitutive gadd <dig> recruitment to the – <dig> /– <dig>  region of the bak promoter was observed in sh-sy5y cells.

discussion
ros is implicated in heavy metal-induced apoptosis. the present study was performed to elucidate roles of ros and downstream events induced-triggered apoptosis. our results represented that cd caused er stress via generation of ros and er stress-induced apoptosis via activation of the gadd153/bak pathway. the outline of our current hypothesis is summarized and illustrated in figure
4d.

previous reports indicated that cd may induce apoptosis through altered activity of protein kinases, phosphatase and transcription factors, generation of ros, induction of mitochondrial pathways or activation of caspases
 <cit> . mechanisms involved may be different from cell type to cell type, but among those, mitochondria have been regarded as the crucial target of cd.

the relationship between oxidative stress and er stress is not well understood. haynes et al. reported that prolonged activation of upr resulted in oxidative stress and consequent cellular death in saccharomyces cerevisiae. accumulation of ros by upr may be caused through two mechanisms; the oxidative folding machinery in the er and the mitochondria dependent ros generation
 <cit> . however, our current results evidenced that oxidative stress was upstream, but not downstream of er stress in cadmium-exposed cell. consistent with our results, some reports also indicated that er stress may be involved downstream of ros
 <cit> .

gadd <dig> is a key control point apoptosis in apoptosis of various cell type, and since it is a transcription factor, gadd <dig> may be responsible for the induction of other genes required for cd-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. the necessity for gadd <dig> in cd-induced apoptosis has been confirmed by gadd <dig> si-rna blocks the apoptotic response to cd .

however, gadd153-sirna doesn’t fully prevent bak expression and apoptosis . it is suggested that gadd <dig> activation may not be the sole mechanisms by which cd cause cell death. bax is another regulator in cd-induced apoptosis . furthermore, level of bcl- <dig>  is not changed by cd . our current finding that cd-induced cell death raises a possibility that gadd153/bak may also be involved not only in cd-induced apoptosis but also in a variety of other biological responses.

the hypothesis that gadd <dig> is responsible for the induction of bak was tested by protein-dna interaction assay. we first hypothesized that putative c/ebp binding site may bind gadd <dig>  the binding sites for the transcription factors seems to be localized in the bak promoter region , because bak luciferase was found to be increased in proportion to the extent of deletion in this region. the nuclear transcription factor gadd <dig> may form heterodimers with other c/ebp-family transcription factors and has been linked to a variety of cellular events including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
 <cit> . the different members of c/ebp family can forms homodimers, heterodimers with another form of the c/ebps and with other transcription factors that may or may not contain the leucine zipper domain
 <cit> .

we herein show that gadd <dig> is critical for cd-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, cd-induced bak expression is mediated through a region between − <dig>  and − <dig>  of the bak promoter. these results provide evidence for the first time that cd-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells is mediated, at least in part, by ros and that regulation via a distinct gadd153/bak is implicated in the apoptotic process. further investigation will be required to elucidate the spectrum of pathophysiological significance of the oxidative stress-er stress axis.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has examined the hypothesis that cd induces neuronal cell death through ros activated by gadd <dig>  our results are showing exposure of sh-sy5y cells to cd led to increase in intracellular ros levels in a doses and time dependent manner. in addition, the generation of ros and induction of gadd <dig> are causative of cadmium-induced apoptosis. gadd <dig> regulates bak expression by its binding to promoter region . these results provide evidence for the first time that cd-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells is mediated, at least in part, by ros and that regulation via a distinct gadd153/bak is implicated in the apoptotic process.
