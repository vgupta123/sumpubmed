BACKGROUND
in bacteria, secreted proteins are involved in stress sensing, substrate binding, cell communication, microbe-host interaction, adhesion, and other essential processes relevant to the environment and life style of the organisms. the secreted proteins are exported via various mechanisms and are retained by the bacterial cell via various interactions or released to the medium . to identify the "secretome"  <cit>  on a genome scale, subcellular proteomic studies have been carried out  <cit> . although these experimental methods have contributed greatly to our knowledge of the subcellular location  of a variety of proteins, until now their scope has remained limited. in contrast, high-throughput computational methods for prediction of scl sequence characteristics can be easily applied to every species whose genome has been sequenced.

computational methods have gained considerable precision in the past decades. initial tools focussed on detecting the presence, type and location of protein transmembrane segments, including signal peptides for targeting and translocation of proteins. one of the very first scl prediction methods was introduced by kyte and doolittle  <cit>  in  <dig> with their amino acid hydropathy index. since the late 90's machine-learning methods became more prominent, including neural networks  <cit> , hidden markov models   <cit> , support vector machines  <cit> , bayesian networks  <cit> , and combined algorithms  <cit> . moreover, present studies tend to combine different resources and methods  <cit> . for example, chou et al.  <cit>  combined gene ontology and functional domain databases, shatkay et al.  <cit>  combined text search and sequence data, and marcotte et al.  <cit>  combined protein homology and phylogenetic profiles in their studies.

unfortunately, as a result of the trade-off between specificity and accuracy, computational methods will always be prone to error. moreover, the number of false predictions increases even further when the scl-related sequence characteristics have not been properly identified. for instance, among the sec-dependent exported proteins, current predictors have severe difficulties to distinguish the proteins that are cleaved from the cell membrane by the type i signal peptidase  – in this paper we will refer to these proteins as "secreted" – from a relatively large group of membrane-anchored proteins that also contain a putative spiase-cleavage site but are not cleaved – in this paper we will lump these proteins in the category "n-anchored"  <cit> .

as knowledge on the precise scl of a protein is especially important to judge the biological nature and role of its activity, we constructed a new scl prediction pipeline called locatep. our pipeline is geared to identify the detailed scl of bacterial proteins by combining existing and novel prediction tools. special effort was made to increase the accuracy of the prediction of n-anchored proteins. the version of locatep presented here focuses on scl prediction of proteins from gram-positive bacteria.

RESULTS
the construction of the scl-prediction pipeline locatep
a major drawback of most current sub-cellular location  predictors is that they are not aimed at the prediction of very specific scls but merely at the rather broad locations intracellular, membrane bound/associated and extracellular, in line with the swiss prot classification system. we therefore constructed a scl predictor pipeline locatep, that distinguishes  <dig> scls and  <dig> targeting pathways that can be identified in gram-positive bacteria, with a focus on extracellular scls .

the locatep pipeline was designed such that it mimics the protein secretion process in gram-positive bacteria. the pipeline structure can be categorized as follows:  secretion pathway prediction,  transmembrane-segment detection,  signal peptide identification, and  cleavage and retention signal recognition. the locatep pipeline employs existing scl prediction tools  as well as our own new and more accurate methods for the prediction of lipoproteins, tat-secreted, n-terminally anchored, c-terminally anchored and secreted proteins . locatep uses at least  <dig> prediction methods for each scl, in order to increase prediction accuracy. the selection criteria imposed on these methods were derived from literature. the locatep pipeline is depicted in figure 2; its construction is described in more detail in the "methods" section and in the legend of figure  <dig>  a detailed flow chart is presented in additional file  <dig>

making the distinction between n-anchored and secreted proteins containing a spi-cleavage site
in the past, the sequence corresponding to the signal peptide has been subdivided into three distinct regions: the n, h and c regions  <cit>  . most of the membrane proteins with a single n-terminal tm anchor are easily identified as they do not have a predicted cleavage site for signal peptidases. however, as mentioned above, the prediction of scl of proteins containing a putative signal peptidase type i  cleavage site appears particularly difficult for current scl predictors. although many sec-exported proteins are cleaved by the spiase, a considerable number of proteins is not cleaved and remains membrane-anchored via the n-terminus  <cit> .

to identify the features that determine cleavage, the multiple sequence alignments of the signal peptides from experimentally validated n-anchored and secreted proteins  <cit>  containing a putative spi cleavage site in bacillus subtilis were analyzed. to enhance the signal, orthologous sequences from other bacilli were added in the analysis . the weblogos  <cit>  of the two collections of sequences are given in figure 3a. no distinguishing pattern could be detected by eye. therefore, a series of hmms were constructed based on the sequence alignments of the n-anchored and secreted proteins. nine pairs of hmms were built for sequences surrounding the putative spi cleavage site. different numbers of residues on either side of the putative cleavage site were included in the models in order to investigate the roles of the h-region and the c-region in cleavage-site recognition. when the hmm pairs were applied to the two respective sets of sequences, it appeared that the hmm pair containing an equal number of residues on either side of the putative cleavage site performed best in predicting correctly whether the cleavage site was genuine or not . the individual hmms were not mutually exclusive for either of the two sets of sequences. however, when the scoring of the two hmms of the pair was combined into a scoring matrix, the experimentally determined non-cleaved and cleaved sequences could be distinguished almost perfectly. the scoring matrix was included in locatep; details of the matrix are described in the legend of figure  <dig> and in the "methods" section.

initial validation of locatep
ideally, the performance of the locatep pipeline should be checked with large experimentally validated data sets. unfortunately, the availability of such large data sets is rather limited. locatep was tested first with the experimental data set of tjalsma et al.  <cit>  which was used to create the hmm pair that distinguishes the n-anchored and secreted proteins containing a putative spi-cleavage site. locatep was able to distinguish these proteins with an accuracy of >90%. then the performance of locatep was tested on ten other data sets. these sets were extracted from literature describing other scl prediction tools. locatep performed extremely well on these sets, as the prediction accuracy was always higher than 90% .

the test sets are: ts <dig>  <cit> , ts <dig>  <cit> ngp = cytoplasmic; ts <dig>  <cit> pgp, ts <dig>  <cit> * = secreted; ts <dig>  <cit> *a = n-anchored; ts <dig>  <cit> *, ts <dig>  <cit> c  <cit> b* = lipid-anchored; ts <dig>  <cit>  = membrane; ts9a  <cit> testrr = cytoplasmic; ts9b  <cit> testrr = membrane; ts 10a  <cit> test,training = cytoplasmic; ts 10b  <cit> test,training = membrane; ts 10c  <cit> test,training = extracellular; ts 10d  <cit> test,training = cell wall; ts11a  <cit> training = cytoplasmic; ts11b  <cit> training = lipid-anchored; ts11c  <cit> training = membrane; ts11d  <cit> training = secreted.

abbreviations: ts: test set; m: membrane; e: extracellular; test: test set of this article; training: training set of this article; ngp: negative training set containing only gram-positive bacterial proteins; pgp: positive training set containing only gram-positive bacterial proteins; rr: the proteins contain twin-arginine residues in the initial  <dig> residues.

a:  <dig> proteins of this set contained putative spi-cleavage site and were included in locatep training process

b: after removing redundancy,  <dig> proteins were left in this set

c: the set contains both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial proteins

d: only the predictions with highest score were taken

e:  <dig> proteins in this test set were either proven to be secreted or they were found to be secreted via minor secretion pathways. locatep focuses on the prediction of major secretion systems, therefore these proteins were predicted as "intracellular", which meant that no classical signal peptides were found in these proteins.

f: most of the proteins in this set are associated on the cell wall via non-covalent interactions such as protein-protein interaction.

g:  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins in this set were predicted as "n-anchored" proteins by locatep, indicating that these proteins could be secreted via sec-pathway but remained attached to the cytoplasmic membrane of the cell.

h: among the support-vector machines involved in tbpred only the best performance with the appropriate protein class was taken.

a second check was done with data collected from transportdb  <cit> . based on expert knowledge on the composition and location of various transport systems and their functional components, the scl prediction of  <dig> transport-related proteins from bacillus subtilis  <dig>  bacillus cereus atcc <dig> and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs <dig> was verified . for a difficult group like the substrate-binding proteins of abc transport systems, locatep identified  <dig> of  <dig> proteins in a correct scl for substrate binding   <cit> . for the other groups of transport-related proteins, the predicted scl fitted the biological role of the transport proteins in ~98% of the cases.

a third less quantitative check included a comparison of the locatep predictions for all n-anchored and secreted proteins of the bacillus subtilis genome with their ncbi functional annotations . nearly all of the predictions appeared to make biological sense according to literature: most of the predicted n-anchored proteins were annotated to be involved in processes that are related to the cell-envelope, such as cell division, transport, cell-envelope biogenesis, mobility, competence, signal transduction, protein turnover, etc; most predicted secreted proteins were indeed known to be secreted enzymes such as extracellular carbohydrases  <cit> , alkaline phosphatases  <cit> , metalloproteases  <cit> , neutral proteases, and subtilisin-family proteases  <cit> .

further validation and comparison of locatep with other tools and pipelines
recently, gardy et al.  <cit>  have compared most of the current scl classifiers, and some tools showed excellent performance. we compared the performance of locatep to a selection of these tools, including the individual scl predictors and other general integrative scl classifiers that were considered best .

on n-anchored, secreted, lipid-anchored and multi-transmembrane protein prediction
locatep and several individual scl prediction tools were applied to the same collection of reference data sets. locatep showed similar or higher recall to predisi, phobius and signalp  <dig>  at signal peptide detection, respectively . locatep performed clearly better than all other tools at predicting lipoproteins and multi-transmembrane proteins . for the group of n-anchored proteins, locatep clearly outperformed all other tools with a much higher prediction specificity and accuracy .

as has been noted by others  <cit> , the n-anchored membrane proteins form an ambiguous group with respect to the location of their biological activity, i.e. outside or inside the cell. various n-anchored proteins are actually active at the cytoplasmic side of the bacterial cell membrane  <cit> . due to the lack of reliable distinguishing algorithms and experimental data, no reliable prediction methods for these "outside-in" proteins are available yet  <cit> . as a result, in the current version of locatep, proteins are only annotated as "n-terminally anchored"; most are presumed to function outside the cell, while some might have intracellular activity. a few of the known intracellular cases are indicated in additional file  <dig> 

on tat-secreted protein prediction
recent research pointed out that the tat-export pathway plays an important role as a parallel protein secretion pathway to the sec-pathway in some gram-positive organisms  <cit> . unfortunately, sec-signal peptide detectors have a high false-negative prediction rate on tat-substrates  <cit> . therefore, we considered it necessary to include a tat-secreted protein prediction tool in the locatep pipeline, and we combined two newly created tat-secreted protein-specific hmms  with tat-find v. <dig>  for the scl prediction of these proteins. tat-signal peptides are known to have an almost invariable double arg or lys+arg motif   <cit>  upstream of the transmembrane segment. it appeared important that the tat-secreted protein predictors can discriminate the tat-signal peptides from sequences  that contain consecutive positively charged residues.

we compared the performance of locatep, tatp and tat-find v <dig>  on the proteins containing a rr/rk pattern in their n-terminus . locatep clearly performed better than the other two specific tools when tested with intracellular and membrane proteins sets, and thus showed an excellent capability of tat-signal peptide detection . moreover, it appeared that tatp and tat-find v <dig>  predicted several proteins to be secreted via the tat-pathway in  <dig> species that apparently lack the relevant pathway genes  <cit> , whereas locatep did not find any tat-pathway substrates in those species. thus, locatep showed the best overall performance among the tat-pathway prediction tools for gram positive bacteria.

comparing locatep and other integrative scl classifiers
according to the comparative study of gardy et al.  <cit> , cello  <cit>  is one of the best scl classification pipelines. we therefore evaluated the performance of locatep as an integrative scl classifier by comparing it to cello and the widely used pipeline psortb.v. <dig>   <cit> . other pipelines like subloc  <cit> , loctree  <cit> , proteome analyst  <cit> , p-classifier  <cit>  and pslpred  <cit>  were not selected because they either do not provide prediction of membrane proteins, or are tailored for gram-negative bacteria, or in the best case showed similar performance to psortb.v. <dig>  or cello. recently, a scl prediction tool called gpos-ploc  <cit>  was published that classifies gram-positive proteins. locatep was not compared to gpos-ploc because its web server accepts only one sequence per search. moreover, the overall accuracy of the tool is reported to be only ~85%  <cit> .

locatep had an accuracy lower than cello  when tested with data extracted from the swiss-prot database . however, when compared using experimental data , cello and psortb v <dig>  showed dramatically poor prediction rates . this poor performance relates to the fact that the training data of cello and psortb v. <dig>  were from the swiss-prot database . this database does not distinguish between n-anchored, secreted and lipoproteins, and at the same time the members of these groups are distributed over two general classes: "membrane" and "extracellular". thus, in essence the poor performance of cello and psortv.b. <dig>  is a consequence of the less-specific classification in swiss-prot . vice versa, the lower accuracy of locatep on the swiss-prot data is related to the inconsistency in the classification.

tbpred  <cit>  is a scl classifier that was especially designed for mycobacteria, based on the idea that organism-specific methods might have higher accuracy  <cit> . we compared locatep with tbpred using the training data of tbpred . surprisingly, locatep showed considerably higher accuracy than tbpred, especially on lipoprotein and secreted protein prediction, even though no mycobacterial proteins were involved in the lipoprotein prediction training process of locatep.

finally, the performance of locatep was compared to augur  <cit> , a computational pipeline that also combines many existing tools. augur detects signal peptides and transmembrane helices using only signalp and tmhmm, and consequently the accuracy of n-anchored protein prediction of augur is much lower than with locatep. augur also falsely predicted  <dig> lipoproteins out of a test-set of  <dig> non-lipoproteins , which implied a higher false-positive rate than locatep on lipoprotein prediction.

comparative analysis of protein subcellular location in gram-positive bacteria
locatep was applied to the encoded proteins of all complete gram-positive bacterial genomes available in the ncbi database. the average distribution of proteins grouped by predicted scl was calculated for each genome. despite the different genome sizes, gram-positive bacteria tend to have a similar distribution of proteins over certain scls independent of class or family, and this independency also holds for individual gram-positive bacterial genomes . we note that the fractions of intracellular and membrane proteins predicted by locatep in gram-positive genomes were consistent with what was previously estimated by other tools  <cit> . the complete genome predictions can be viewed in our database locatep-db  <cit> .

discussion
although the early scl-prediction tools performed rather poorly, current tools perform rather well on specific categories of signal-peptide containing proteins and membrane proteins  <cit> , reaching an accuracy of 96%. nevertheless, for other groups like secreted, n-anchored and lipoproteins these tools still perform rather poorly. as the latter groups represent a considerable part of the secretome, we decided to design a new scl-identification pipeline called locatep.

the performance of locatep was checked against the best current tools and it outperformed all of them, particularly when difficult groups of proteins and scls were concerned. the outstanding performance was achieved though the generation of specific hmms based on protein sequences whose cellular fate had been experimentally tested. for instance, it has long been a problem to identify secreted and n-anchored proteins from the group of proteins carrying a putative spi-cleavage site motif. formerly, the h-region together with the cleavage site were considered to be the key elements of spiase-substrate recognition. therefore, previous signal-peptide predictors were constructed focusing on the h-region and/or on the cleavage site  <cit> . however, carlos et al.  <cit>  found that the h-region of the spiase substrate was not critical for peptidase-cleavage capability but that, in contrast, mutations in the c-region of originally non-cleaved proteins caused alternative cleavage. they therefore claimed that specific substrate-enzyme interactions around the c-region should be decisive for spiase-cleavage site recognition. indeed, our analysis of the signal sequences of a group of secreted and n-anchored proteins indicated that the c-region is important, but that at the same time also the h-region carries properties that determine the protein's fate . the fact that the performance of the dedicated hmms became worse when the sequence was extended beyond  <dig> residues implies that the decisive information is present in this stretch of sequence. locatep improved the separation of n-anchored and secreted proteins from ~40%  to > 90% without disturbing the scl prediction of the other types of proteins.

locatep was designed as a pipeline, and hence could have performed less well on specific categories than specialized tools. in particular, the performance would have been considerably lower if the flow scheme had been chosen wrongly. however, a comparison of the performance on lipoproteins, membrane proteins, sec-secreted and tat-secreted proteins with the specialized tools lipop  <dig> , tmhmm  <dig> , phobius, signalp  <dig> , predisi, tat-find v. <dig>  and tatp shows that locatep does not suffer from being a pipeline tool. apparently, our choice to mimic the order in the bacterial secretion process was a correct one. in fact, it has been shown by others that the scl prediction can be improved considerably by simulating the protein sorting processes  <cit> . overall, locatep performed very well, with an accuracy higher than 95% for nearly all categories, and only slightly lower in one case , but still considerably better than all other tools. locatep could be used to distinguish  <dig> scls and  <dig> sorting pathways and avoided the inconsistent scl classification which most scl classifiers inevitably inherited from swiss-prot.

because of the high prediction accuracy of locatep on proteins of known biological function , we expect that the scl prediction of proteins of unknown function should also be equally reliable. in principle, the genome-scale scl predictions made by locatep provide an excellent starting point for functional annotation and experimental analysis of encoded proteins of unknown function, as they provide numerous clues about where to look for a certain biological activity.

although locatep already performs quite well, there is inevitably room for improvement. for instance, in the swiss-prot database, many of the annotated cell-wall proteins are secreted proteins bound to the cell surface via non-covalent interactions. known elements of non-covalent binding include choline-binding domains, lysm domains, type  <dig> cell-wall binding domains, gw-modules, lysin-binding motifs, chw-binding motifs, wxl domains, lpp-region binding, s-layer proteins, and others  <cit> . the current version of locatep was designed to predict only the covalent cell-wall  binding mechanism of proteins by dedicated sortases. for instance, among the  <dig> cell-wall proteins in test set 10d  <cit> ,  <dig> are non-covalently cell-wall bound secreted proteins. locatep correctly predicted  <dig> of these as "secreted proteins", but does not allow for the fact that these proteins could be cell-wall bound via non-covalent mechanisms after secretion . future versions of locatep will include non-covalent binding to the cell wall.

not all mechanisms of protein secretion or modification are known to date and not all have been included in the locatep pipeline yet  <cit> . this is the case for proteins that have been shown to occur at various locations or those that are secreted via minor pathways. examples are proteins that are either cleaved multi-domain proteins  <cit> , auto-transporters found in both cytoplasmic and extracellular locations  <cit> , or proteins with various scl depending on growth phase and/or specific environment  <cit> . the multi-compartment proteins and minor-pathway secreted proteins appear to be rare in most bacteria, and their sorting mechanisms are not completely understood yet. therefore, the current version of locatep predicts only one scl for such proteins, which may be only partially correct. in contrast, psortb v <dig>  and cello were claimed to be capable of multi-location prediction  <cit> . both tools employ machine-learning methods and the predicted multiple locations should represent a certain statistical significance even without large-scale experimental evidence. however, both tools inevitably generate a considerable number of false positives. similarly, secretomep  <dig>   <cit> , which was made to predict non-classically secreted proteins, was not included in locatep because of its high false-prediction rate. the recent predictors euk-mploc  <cit>  and hum-mploc  <cit>  incorporated up-to-date eukaryotic proteins that were found to have multiple compartments and the tools achieved rather satisfying accuracies. similar tools will be included or constructed for locatep when more experimental data on multiple locations of bacterial proteins are available.

another group of proteins that is not treated separately by locatep is the group that is exported by unknown mechanisms and is known as the gram-positive periplasmic proteins  <cit> . carlsson et al.  <cit>  recently reported that in gram-positive bacteria the secreted proteins could be directed to different extracellular regions including a periplasmic space. in fact, the prediction of a subcellular location "periplasmic" in gram-positive was not included in any published scl prediction tools for gram-positive bacteria, except in gpos-ploc  <cit> . however, the gpos-ploc prediction algorithm was based on only  <dig> proteins which were extracted from the swiss-prot database. indeed, among these  <dig> proteins, four were expressed in the e. coli periplasmic space, but no evidence exists that they are also expressed in the periplasm of a gram-positive organism  <cit> . moreover, one protein  was proven to be located inside the cell  <cit> . locatep predicted correctly that  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins should be secreted and are located outside of the plasma membrane, while p <dig> was predicted to be cytoplasmic, in line with the experimental evidence.

locatep was first tailored for the scl prediction of gram-positive bacterial proteins; therefore prediction of the gram-negative specific proteins, such as β-barrel membrane proteins, was not yet included in the pipeline. locatep was compared to sigtree  <cit> , a signal-peptide detector based on sets of experimentally verified e. coli proteins, using the same data set from e. coli . locatep showed slightly lower accuracy than sigtree did, which suggests that the sequence composition of signal peptides from gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial proteins could be different. future versions of locatep will be improved and extended to gram-negative bacterial protein scl prediction by incorporating gram-negative specific subcellular-location prediction tools.

finally, we must emphasize that in several cases an automatic scl prediction of a protein will inevitably give an incorrect prediction using locatep or any other tool:  when the start codon of a gene encoding a protein with a signal peptide has been wrongly identified ,  when a frame shift in the open-reading frame leads to different fragments of encoded proteins, and  when an intracellular protein contains a signal peptide-like hydrophobic helix near the n-terminus; in this case such helices generally fold into the interior of the globular protein  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
as detailed and accurate genome-scale scl prediction of encoded proteins is highly desired by scientists in various biological research areas, numerous existing and newly developed tools were combined into one pipeline: locatep. to date, locatep is the most detailed protein scl predictor for gram-positive bacterial proteins among all tools that have been reported, in that it presently distinguishes  <dig> different scls and  <dig> sorting pathways, with focus on extracellular scls. moreover, it is also the most accurate scl predictor, especially on distinguishing n-anchored and secreted proteins. locatep was applied on all completed gram-positive bacterial genomes from the ncbi sequence database. the results are updated synchronously with genbank updates and are publicly available via the database locatep-db  <cit> . the present version contains scl predictions for  <dig>  proteins in  <dig> genomes of gram-positive bacteria. these genome-scale scl predictions provide an excellent starting point for experimentalists to improve the functional annotation of proteins.
