BACKGROUND
plants have developed complex signal transduction pathways to cope with a fluctuating environment throughout their life cycle. environmental stresses, such as high salinity, drought, cold and pathogens affect not only plant growth and development but also their yield and food quality. ca2+ is a ubiquitous second messenger that is involved in the signaling of a variety of environmental and developmental stimuli. in response to these stimuli, cells generate transient changes in the intracellular ca2+ concentration and, these changes are sensed and decoded by ca2+ sensors including calmodulins , calmodulin-like proteins , calcineurin b-like proteins  and calcium-dependent protein kinases   <cit> .

cbl and cbl-interacting protein kinase  proteins were originally identified in the model plant arabidopsis  <cit> . cbl proteins show high similarity to the regulatory b subunit of calcineurin  and neuronal calcium sensor  proteins in animals and yeast  <cit> . as a structural basis for ca2+ binding, cbls contain four ef-hand domains that can bind at most four ca2+ ions  <cit> . cbls specifically target a group of snf <dig> -related serine/threonine kinases, group  <dig> , namely cipks, to transduce the perceived calcium signal  <cit> . commonly, cipk proteins consist of a conserved n-terminal kinase domain, and a c-terminal regulatory domain, which is separated from the kinase domain by a variable junction domain. ca2+-bound cbls interact with and activate the catalytic activity of targeting cipks through a conserved naf or fisl motif within the rather divergent c-terminal regulatory domain  <cit> . moreover, a few cipks can also interact with specific members of the 2c-type protein phosphatase  through a protein–phosphatase interaction  domain within the c-terminus of these kinases  <cit> . so far, bioinformatic analyses of both cbl and cipk families have identified a total of  <dig> cbls and  <dig> cipks in arabidopsis, and  <dig> cbls and  <dig> cipks in rice , respectively, many of which have been reported to show distinct and selective interactions among these complementary partners  <cit> . this selectivity allows for a complex interplay of different cbl-cipk combinations that, in turn, could decode the ca2+ signals from different stimuli through spatiotemporal regulation of downstream signaling cascades. furthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that phosphorylation of cbl proteins by their interacting cipks is required for full activity of cbl-cipk complexes toward their target proteins  <cit> .

over the past decade, the cbl-cipk network in arabidopsis has been demonstrated to play an important role in regulating sodium , potassium  and nitrate  transport across the plasma membrane  and/or tonoplast  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a few members of cbl and cipk family genes have also been identified to participate in auxin and abscisic acid  signaling, as well as many other developmental processes in arabidopsis  <cit> . the first genetically defined cbl-cipk network was identified in a genetic screen for a salt overly sensitive  phenotype, and in this pathway cbl <dig>  interacts with cipk <dig> , and this interaction recruits the kinase to the plasma membrane, where it activates the plasma membrane-localized na+/h+ antiporter  and vacuolar h+-atpase to promote salt tolerance  <cit> . later on, it was reported that arabidopsis cbl <dig> also interacts with cipk <dig>  the cbl10-cipk <dig> complex is associated with the vacuolar compartments, and functions in protecting shoots from salt stress  <cit> . an arabidopsis cipk <dig> mutant shows aba hypersensitivity during seed germination and alters the expression pattern of a number of stress marker genes in response to aba, cold, and high salt  <cit> .

in another forward-genetic screen, mutants sensitive to low potassium showed that loss of cipk <dig>  function impaired growth under k+-limiting conditions, and the interaction of cbl <dig> or cbl <dig> with cipk <dig> recruits it to the plasma membrane, where it phosphorylates and activates the k+ channel akt <dig>  <cit> , although recent evidence suggests that cbl <dig> or cbl <dig> may interact independently of cipk <dig> with akt <dig>  <cit> . moreover, arabidopsis cipk <dig> and cipk <dig> also interact with akt <dig> in a yeast two-hybrid assay and enhance the activity of akt <dig> in a cbl-dependent manner in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . in addition, arabidopsis cbl4-cipk <dig> modulates the activity and plasma membrane  targeting of another k+ channel, akt <dig>  by mediating translocation of akt <dig> to the pm in plant cells and enhancing akt <dig> activity in oocytes  <cit> . besides, atcipk <dig> was shown to be involved in auxin transport and consequently in root development, as well as in the salt-stress response  <cit> . another group identified two cipks that mediate nitrate nutrition, among which cipk <dig> positively regulates the low-affinity phase of the primary nitrate response and cipk <dig> can phosphorylate t <dig> of chl <dig>  to maintain a low-level primary response  <cit> . these studies demonstrate that cbl-cipk networks play important roles in a variety of environmental stresses.

a similar cbl-cipk network seems also to exist in rice and maize, as indicated by the presence of ten cbls and  <dig> cipks in rice and,  <dig> cipks in maize  <cit> . although the functional significance of most of these cbl-cipk interactions is not yet clear, they suggest a very complex and dynamic signal transduction network regulated by this calcium sensor and ser/thr protein kinase system. despite extensive studies of the cbl-cipk network in arabidopsis, so far, there is only one report that suggests brassica napus cbl1-cipk <dig> is involved in the plant response to high-salinity, phosphorous deficiency, and aba signaling  <cit> . therefore the identities and roles of the cbl-cipk network in b. napus  are still largely unknown. how specific cbl-cipk complexes participate in canola growth and development as well as in response to abiotic and biotic stresses is waiting to be revealed.

canola-quality oil is defined by low erucic acid and low glucosinolates, and crops that produce canola oil are among the most important oil crops in china and worldwide. losses from adverse environmental conditions greatly influence canola yield and quality. understanding the molecular mechanisms of canola responses to abiotic stresses is a prerequisite for improving stress tolerance to meet the increasing demanding for edible oil. it is a promising approach to improve stress tolerance of plants through modulating the expression of key genes in plant breeding. to this end, we initiated the detailed characterization of cbl and cipk genes in canola  and systematically analyzed the interactions between each cbl and cipk. we also examined the expression patterns of most of the identified cbl and cipk genes in response to a variety of hormone and stress treatments. through this work, we will better be able to understand the roles of cbl-cipk network in canola responses to abiotic stress and hormone stimuli.

RESULTS
the identification and cloning of cbl and cipk genes in canola
in our previous transcritpomic analysis of canola seed coat development, at least four cipk genes were shown to be differentially expressed with a two-fold change or more  <cit> . as the first step to understand the roles of cbl and cipk genes in canola growth and development, as well as in response to abiotic stresses, we aimed to identify and clone cbl and cipk genes from canola. since the sequencing of the brassica napus genome is still incomplete and arabidopsis is a close relative to b. napus, we used  <dig> arabidopsis cbl and  <dig> cipk genes as queries, and ran blast searches of the expressed sequence tag  database of b. napus in ncbi . as a result, we identified  <dig> ests representing cbls and  <dig> ests for cipks , which showed significant similarities, with an e-value lower than 10- <dig>  these ests were further filtered and assembled to obtain contigs and singlets, which were then reciprocally blast searched against arabidopsis database  to identify the putative orthologs in the model plant arabidopsis. the bnacbl and bnacipk genes were therefore annotated based on the arabidopsis orthologs with bna standing for brassica napus to differentiate it from b. nigra  . afterwards, the amino acids of each contig or singlet were predicted using dnaman or dnastar program. as a result, we successfully identified ests representing  <dig> bnacbl and  <dig> bnacipk genes .

the calcineurin b-like proteins  and cbl-interacting protein kinases  genes of canola  were identified through mining the expression sequence tags , with cdna sequences cloned through race-pcr and deposited in the genbank. the nomenclature of bnacbl and cipk followed that of arabidospis through a comparison in inparanoid <dig> . the molecular weight  and isoelectric point  of the encoded proteins were predicted by dnaman software. the number of ef-hands was predicted by prosite scan. the palmitoylation sites were predicted by css-palm  <dig>  and myristoylation sites by myristoylator. n.d., not detected.

we noted that among all the bnacbls annotated, bnacbl <dig> had the largest number  of ests, followed by bnacbl <dig> with a total of  <dig> ests and, bnacbl <dig> with  <dig> ests while bnacbl <dig> has only one est . among the  <dig> bnacipks annotated, bnacipk <dig> had the largest number  of ests, followed by bnacipk <dig> with a total of  <dig> ests and bnacipk <dig> with  <dig> ests, while bnacipk <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had only one est each . to facilitate subsequent phylogenetic, gfp fusion, and yeast two-hybrid analyses, we designed primers based on the identified ests for each of the bnacbl and bnacipk genes to obtain full length cdna sequences, employing rt-pcr together with race. as a result, we succeeded in cloning the cdna sequences of six of these seven bnacbl genes, and  <dig> of these  <dig> bnacipk genes . we were also able to identify putative orthologs of these bnacbl and bnacipk genes in both arabidopsis and rice using the program inparanoid  .

the deduced amino acid sequences of six bnacbl genes demonstrated great conservation in size . the molecular weight of the predicted proteins ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. we also identified that the amino acid sequence identity of different bnacbls ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % , with highly conserved c-terminal regions flanking the ef-hand domains.

as in atcbl <dig> and oscbl <dig>  four ef-hand motifs in the six bnacbls could be identified . as ca2+ sensors, cbl proteins are able to bind ca2+ ions through the ef-hand motifs  <cit> . indeed, each of the six bnacbl proteins was found to contain four ef-hand motifs , although some of the ef-hand motifs were not canonical, as compared to calmodulin  and calmodulin-like  proteins from arabidopsis, rice, c. elegans, yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish, mouse and human . each ef-hand consisted of a loop of  <dig> amino acids flanked by two helices . the e helix generally starts with a glutamate  and, f helix a leucine , phenylalanine  or isoleucine ; both the e and f helices flanking the ca2+-binding loop are generally each  <dig> amino acids long . however, the ef <dig> loop of bnacbls contains an insertion of two amino acid residues between position  <dig> and position  <dig>  previous studies also demonstrated that the cbl–cipk interaction may also affect the ca2+-binding capacity of cbls, as observed with atcbl2/atcipk <dig> and atcbl4/atcipk <dig>  <cit> .

in addition, we used the motif scan program  and other programs to search other possible motifs that could be functionally important in fulfilling their roles. myristoylation is an irreversible protein modification in which myristate, a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid, is covalently attached through an amide bond to an n-terminal glycine residue in a co-translational process  <cit> . our analysis revealed that three bnacbl proteins  started with a conserved n-myristoylation motif  that might function in membrane targeting of the cbl-cipk complex, whereas the other three bnacbl proteins did not have such a motif . this structural feature was also observed within rice cbl proteins  <cit> . in contrast, palmitoylation  is the reversible addition of fatty acids to proteins, which increases their membrane affinity. s-acylated proteins play a wide variety of roles in plants and affect calcium signalling, k+ movement, stress and hormone signaling and many other processes  <cit> . both myristoylation and palmitoylation are involved in the membrane association of various proteins, such as g protein alpha-subunits, src tyrosine kinases and nitric oxide synthase in animals, however, little is known about roles of them in plants until recent years  <cit> . interestingly, we found that all the six bnacbl protein bear typical palmitoylation sites at the n-terminal, although the meaning awaits further investigation. a recent study demonstrated that palmitoylation of the arabidopsis cbl <dig> associates it with the vacuolar membrane, which is essential for proper aba responses  <cit> . moreover, we observed in the canola bnacbl <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> proteins a very conserved cysteine  residue following the glycine  as a structural feature, suggesting a potential dual n-terminal lipid modification of these three canola cbls. similar observations were also made with arabidopsis cbl <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> and it was demonstrated that dual fatty acyl modification determines the localization and plasma membrane targeting of cbl1-cipk <dig> signaling complexes in arabidopsis  <cit> .

as for bnacipk proteins, the molecular weight of the predicted proteins ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda . we also found that the amino acid sequence identity of different bnacipks ranged from 37% to  <dig> % . the deduced amino acid sequences of  <dig> bnacipk genes demonstrated great conservation in size . as in cipks from arabidopsis, all bnacipks consisted of a conserved n-terminal kinase domain, followed by a variable junction domain and a c-terminal regulatory domain, . within the rather divergent regulatory domain, a conserved naf or fisl motif was identified, which has been reported to be required for mediating cbl interaction  <cit> . meme analysis showed that the amino acid residues at the 5th, 6th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 18th, 21th, 22th sites of the naf/fsil motif are rather conserved, while others not . even at the conserved sites of this motif, variations also existed in canola cipk proteins. for example, we noted that the fifth amino acid residue of the naf motif in bnacipk <dig> was t  instead of n , and the 21st amino acid residue of bnacipk <dig> was f  instead of l  . whether these differences in amino acid residues of a cipk have any influence on their ability to interact with cbls needs to be investigated. similar changes in other plant cipks were also observed, including atcipk <dig>  atcipk <dig>  oscipk <dig> and phaseolus vulgaris  cipk <dig> . sequence analysis also revealed a protein–phosphatase interaction  motif within the c-terminus of these kinases , which is assumed to mediate the cipk interaction with type 2c protein phosphatases   <cit> . however, the amino acids within this ppi motif showed very limited conservation, except at sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which are amino acids arginine , phenylalanine , serine , isoleucine , lysine  and glutamate , respectively .

phylogenetic analysis of bnacbl and bnacipk proteins
to better understand the evolutionary history of both cbl and cipk families, we also identified and retrieved cbl and cipk genes from a variety of species using an hmm-based search. the search space was composed primarily of fully-sequenced genomes from the major land plant lineages including the bryophyte physcomitrella patens , the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii , and several mono- and eudicotyledonous angiosperms, i.e. the eudicots arabidopsis thaliana , medicago truncata , pisum sativum  solanum lycopersicum , and glycine max <cit> , and the monocots oryza sativa , sorghum bicolor , brachypodium distachyon , and zea mays   . to differentiate cbl genes from calmodulin  or calcium-dependent protein kinase  genes, whose protein sequences also contain ef-hand motifs, and to separate cipk genes from snrk1s, snrk2s or other types of kinase genes, we ran a reciprocal blastp search of these putative cbls or cipks from other species against databases of arabidopsis  and rice , and also analyzed the domain characteristics. only cbl or cipk genes were kept to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees. to trace the origins of both cbl and cipk gene families, we also performed an hmm-based search of any possible cbl or cipk genes from a marine green alga ostreococcus tauri , which is the world’s smallest free-living eukaryote known to date  <cit>  and also from a pico-eukaryotic  prasinophyte green alga ostreococcus lucimarinus, which has one of the highest gene densities known in eukaryotes  <cit> . as a result, we identified one cbl and one cipk gene from each of these two algal species , which were also reported recently  <cit> .

although previous studies reported  <dig> cipk genes in rice   <cit> , our search indentified an additional four putative oscipk genes, loc_os07g <dig>  loc_os12g <dig>  loc_os11g <dig> and loc_os02g <dig>  we named these oscipk <dig> to oscipk <dig>  respectively . the protein sequences of oscipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> had complete kinase and regulatory domains, with naf/fisl motif in the c-terminal regions, which are characteristics of cipks . similarity comparisons showed the encoded proteins of oscipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> had high similarity to atcipk <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> and - <dig>  respectively, among the  <dig> atcipk proteins compared . on the other hand, using our criteria, we found that the previously identified rice oscipk <dig> and oscipk <dig> were atypical cipks, since oscipk <dig> had an incomplete kinase domain and oscipk <dig> had lost the region containing the fisl/naf motif, which is pointed out previously  <cit>  . moreover, we found that the locus number of oscipk <dig>  may have been wrongly annotated  <cit> , since the encoded protein of os05g <dig> does not have any characteristics of a cipk protein and does not show any significant similarity to any arabidopsis protein either. we assigned a new locus number loc_os05g <dig> to oscipk <dig> gene . we also found that oscipk <dig> and oscipk <dig> had almost identical protein sequences , except that there were three substitutions and a five amino acid insertions at the c-terminal end of oscipk <dig> . as for oscipk <dig> and oscipk <dig>  their protein sequences also showed  <dig> % identity or 96% similarity , except that there were three substitutions and a  <dig> amino acid insertion in the c-terminal region of oscipk <dig> . the high identity existing between oscipk <dig> and - <dig> as well as oscipk <dig> and - <dig> suggests genome duplication of rice cipk genes during evolution. according to our criteria, we excluded oscipk <dig> and - <dig> from the phylogenetic analysis of cipk family as described below.

similarly, we identified cbl and cipk genes from other plant species, for instance, brachypodium distachyon , tomato , medicago truncatula , a diploid cotton , apple , and the moss physcomitrella patens  as listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the identification of multiple members of cbl and cipk gene families in all the analyzed plant species suggests that cbl and cipk proteins very likely form a complex signaling network to respond to developmental and environmental stimuli  <cit> .

it was observed that the size of the canola cbl or cipk gene family is comparable to that in either arabidopsis or rice, although the exact numbers await to be determined after sequencing of canola genome is finished. on the other hand, only five cbl and seven cipk genes were identified from the lower land plants p. patens, and a sole cbl and cipk were identified in both o. tauri and o. lucimarinus , as was recently described elsewhere  <cit> . this indicates an expansion of these two gene families after the divergence of flowering plants from the remainder of the tracheophyte lineage. furthermore, comparing the numbers of cbl and cipk genes between lower and higher organisms indicates an obvious expansion of both gene families during the long history of evolution.

the amino acid sequences of bnacbls or bnacipks together with cbls or cipks from other species were aligned separately and a bootstrapped consensus maximum parsimony  tree was inferred for cbl  and cipk  gene families, respectively. as shown by the tree’s topology, the cbl proteins from various species could be divided into four major groups , each supported by highly significant bootstrap values. the six canola cbls were distributed in each of the four groups, with bnacbl <dig> and - <dig> belonging to group iii, bnacbl <dig> and - <dig> group iv, bnacbl <dig> group i, and bnacbl <dig> group ii . it was also noted that the six bnacbl members were always clustered closely with atcbl orthologs, which indicates that the relationship of the two species in brassicae family are evolutionarily more closely than that of other dicots or monocots we investigated here.

to gain insights in the evolutionary history of the cipk family in plants, we used the  <dig> canola cipk sequences as well as those identified and retrieved from various plant species . the deduced amino acid sequences of a single cipk gene from o. tauri  and o. lucimarinus  each were used to root a bootstrapped consensus tree. the resulting dendrogram showed all cipks could be classified into four distinct groups , based on their sequence similarity, which was further supported by the high bootstrap values . we found that the identified  <dig> bnacipks could be assigned unambiguously to four separate groups, together with  <dig> atcipks and  <dig> typical oscipks. group i included bnacipk <dig> and - <dig>  group ii included bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  group iii included bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> and, group iv included bnacipk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  as expected, all of the  <dig> bnacipks were clustered more closely with arabidopsis than those of other species. another interesting feature is that the intron-rich cipks coincidently formed a monophyletic group i, which was separated from the other groups that contained intron-poor cipks, which is consistent with previous reports  <cit> .

from our phylogenetic analysis, multiple alignment and domain analysis of bnacbls and bnacipks in canola, we concluded some of the cbl and cipk family members may be conserved among monocots or dicots, while others were lost after the divergence of the monocots and dicots. for instance, we found that cbl <dig> and cbl <dig> are presented in the dicots arabidopsis and canola, but absent in the monocot rice, based on a stringent orthologous analysis . the phylogenetic analysis together with the domain motif analysis presented here will facilitate the functional annotation and study of canola cbls and cipks.

subcellular localization of selected bnacbl and bnacipk proteins
the subcellular localization of a protein may provide evidence of its function. so far, the subcellular localization of several arabidopsis cbl and cipk proteins has been determined  <cit> , however the subcellular localization of many other cbl or cipk proteins from arabidopsis, rice and a few other species has not been reported. we selected three bnacbls and two bnacipks for fusion to the green fluorescent protein  reporter gene. we first fused the coding regions of bnacbl <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> as well as, bnacipk <dig> and - <dig> to the 5′ of gfp in a binary vector. to help to determine the subcellular localization of the fusion proteins, two intracellular localization markers fused to mcherry fluorescent protein were used. one is cbl1n, which harbors only the n-terminal of arabidopsis cbl <dig> protein, which has been shown to localize at the plasma membrane  <cit> . the other is the tonoplast marker, two-pore channel  <dig> , from arabidopsis  <cit> . an agrobacterium tumefaciens suspension culture transformed with each of these bnacbl- or bnacipk-gfp constructs, together with the corresponding marker construct, was co-infiltrated into leaves of n. benthamiana, and the gfp and mcherry signals were examined two days later. as shown in figure  <dig>  the bnacbl1-gfp fusion protein emitted a green fluorescent signal in nuclei and plasma membranes of epidermal cells of leaves and, bnacbl9-gfp appeared in the cytoplasm and nuclei , whereas bnacbl10-gfp was localized in the vacuolar membrane or tonoplast . bnacipk3-gfp and bnacipk10-gfp were also localized in both cytoplasm and nuclei . as a control, we tested the subcellular localization of gfp protein alone in the leaf cells of n. benthamiana and observed that the signal was spread all over the cytoplasm of the leaf epidermal cells as well as in the nuclei .

previous studies on the subcellular localizations of arabidopsis cbl and cipk proteins demonstrated that both atcbl <dig> and atcbl <dig> localize to the plasma membrane  <cit> , although in approximately 20% of the analyzed cells, the authors also observed traces of cbl9-gfp localization in the nucleus  <cit> . it was also shown that atcbl <dig> is localized at the vacuolar membrane  <cit> .

comparing subcellular localization of the orthologs of cbl <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> between arabidopsis and canola, we concluded that the patterns were generally conserved, except for the nuclear localization of bnacbl <dig>  as for cipks, a previous study displayed a similar localization pattern that included strong fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nucleus for arabidopsis cipk <dig> and cipk <dig> proteins  <cit> , with is completely in agreement with our assay with canola orthologs.

to further analyze the subcellular locations of the respective canola cbl and cipk proteins, we used four different online programs: wolf psort, cello v <dig> , targetp and eslpred, to predict the subcellular localization of the six bnacbls and  <dig> bnacipks . it was obvious that differences existed between the predictions from these four programs, although most predictions pointed to cytoplasmic and/or nuclear localization of bnacbl and bnacipk proteins. at the same time, we used tmhmm  to predict transmembrane helices  of these proteins and only one tmh was predicted with bnacbl <dig> protein . comparing the prediction results to in vivo assay using gfp as presented above suggests that it is important to examine the subcellular locations of cbl or cipk in planta.

interaction patterns between bnacbl and bnacipk proteins
most of the cbl and cipk genes that have been characterized to date are from arabidopsis. it has been reported that different cbl proteins interact with different cipk proteins and the specificity of this interaction determines the network outcome  <cit> . to investigate the interaction preferences of cbl proteins with cipks of canola, we used a yeast two-hybrid system. six bnacbls and  <dig> bnacipks were cloned in-frame into pgbkt <dig> and pgadt <dig> vectors, respectively. after transformation into the yeast strain ah <dig>  interactions were detected by growth on nonselective , selecting media lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan supplemented with 5 mm of 3-aminotriazole  , and selecting media lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan, adenine hemisulfate . we observed that the colony growth on the two types of selective media  was slightly different and only those yeast colonies that grew on the most stringent media sd-ltha were scored as having interacting protein partners. the authenticity and strength of the interactions were further examined by a titration assay and x-gal staining .

as shown in figure  <dig>  bnacbl <dig> interacted significantly with a subset of  <dig> cipks, among which it showed strong interactions with bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> but weak interactions with bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . bnacbl <dig> exhibited a significant interaction with  <dig> cipks, which were bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . bnacbl <dig> exhibited a strong interaction with only eight of the  <dig> bnacipks, and they were bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . as for bnacbl <dig>  an ortholog of arabidopsis sos <dig>  it interacted with  <dig> bnacipks, among which it interacted strongly with bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  but showed very weak interactions with bnacipk <dig> and - <dig> . bnacbl <dig> also exhibited a significant interaction with  <dig> out of  <dig> cipks, among which it interacted strongly with bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  less strongly with bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  whereas a weaker interaction was observed between bnacbl <dig> and bnacipk <dig> . lastly, bnacbl <dig> was found to interact with only a small subset of seven bnacipks, among which it interacted most strongly with bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  less strongly with bnacipk <dig> and - <dig> and, very weakly with bnacipk <dig> . looking at the interactions from a different point of view, we found that bnacipk <dig> and - <dig> did not show any interaction with any of the six bnacbls, suggesting they may interact with other unknown bnacbl. on the contrary, bnacipk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> showed interactions with all of the six bnacbl, although the strength of interactions differed from one to another.

we then compared the interaction patterns of cbls-cipks between canola and arabidopsis to see to what extent differences existed between orthologs in two evolutionarily close species. however, a complete list of arabidopsis cbl-cipk interactions was not available. it has been reported that both arabidopsis cbl <dig> and cbl <dig> interact with atcipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  while atcbl <dig> also interacts with atcipk <dig> and atcbl <dig> with atcipk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . compared to our data, the shared interactors of atcbl <dig> and bnacbl <dig> were cipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  while the common interacting cipks of atcbl <dig> and bnacbl <dig> were cipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  although we note that the full-length cdna sequences of bnacipk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> have not yet been cloned . in addition, atcbl <dig> was previously found to interact strongly with atcipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and weakly with atcipk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  among these  <dig> cipks tested  <cit> . in comparison, in our data, bnacbl <dig> interacted with bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  but not with bnacipk <dig> or - <dig>  lastly, arabidopsis cbl <dig> did not show any interaction with atcipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . however, in our experiments with canola, among the orthologs of the  <dig> atcipks that atcbl <dig> interacts with, bnacbl <dig> interacted with bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  overall, the interaction patterns between cbls and cipks in arabidopsis and canola showed several differences, which may be due to two reasons: the inherent biological differences between the two species and technical differences such as the vectors and yeast strains used. the results also show that predicting gene function in canola based on data from arabidopsis does not produce accurate predictions in all cases. comparison of cbl-cipk interactions between canola and rice is not possible as a systematic study of oscbl and oscipk interactions has not yet been reported.

interestingly, the preferential interactions between bnacbls and bnacipks, as reported in the y2h assay above, do not appear to be consistent with the inferred phylogenetic relationships of the bnacipks. for instance, of the closely related cipk pairs, only bnacipk <dig> and bnacipk <dig> as well as bnacipk <dig> and bnacipk <dig> exhibited a similar interaction profile toward most of the six bnacbls assayed, that is, the former two interacted with bnacbl <dig>  - <dig> - <dig> and - <dig>  and the latter two with bnacbl <dig>  - <dig> - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . on the other hand, the other three pairs of closely related duplicated cipk pairs, which are bnacipk5/ <dig>  bnacipk8/ <dig> and bnacipk9/ <dig>  displayed a rather different interaction profile, because, for example, bnacipk <dig> interacted with bnacbl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  whereas bnacipk <dig> only interacted with bnacbl <dig> and - <dig> and, bnacipk <dig> showed a preferential association with bnacbl <dig> only, while bnacipk <dig> showed strong interaction with bnacbl <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  besides, bnacipk <dig> interacted with five of the six bnacbls tested, however, bnacipk <dig> did not show interaction with any of the six bnacbls, which was different from its counterpart  in arabidopsis  <cit> . our findings indicate the necessity of empirically studying the canola cbl-cipk network rather than simply making inferences from arabidopsis. similar observations were also made with cbl and cipk complex formation in arabidopsis  <cit> . taken together, these data from a systematic y2h assay indicate that sequence similarity and evolutionary history are not sufficient to predict cbl-cipk interactions. thus, understanding the exact structural features that determine the specificity of cbl-cipk complex formation will help to explain why two closely related cipk proteins show differential interaction profile towards cbls. the structural analyses of the complexes formed between the regulatory domains of arabidopsis cipk <dig> and the calcium sensor cbl <dig> as well as between cipk <dig> and cbl <dig> provide clear evidence of how and through which domain cbls and cipks interact with each other  <cit> . furthermore, analyses of the crystal structures also provide critical insights into the conformational change of cbl that occurs after binding of calcium ions through the ef-hand motifs and, the interaction of cipk with cbl via the naf/fisl motif within the c-terminal regulatory region.

the observed differences in interaction profile of pairs of closely related cipk proteins might suggest that a high degree of conservation in the sequences existing between certain cbl or cipk family members do not necessarily indicate that they are functionally redundant. for instance, arabidopsis cipk <dig> and cipk <dig>  are two phylogenetically closely related cipks, however their functions are quite different. atcipk <dig> regulates the low-affinity phase of the primary nitrate response  <cit> , while cipk <dig>  is required for extrusion of na+ from the cytosol to the extracellular matrix  <cit> . furthermore, despite the fact that there is high similarity between bnacbl <dig> and bnacbl <dig> , the data presented here indicate bnacbl <dig> can form a complex with bnacik <dig> and - <dig>  whereas bnacbl <dig> cannot, indicating that both ca2+ sensor proteins could target specific cipks with different efficiency to respond to different stimuli. similar finding was also made with arabidopsis cbl <dig> and cbl <dig>  <cit> .

another intriguing question is why each of the  <dig> bnacipks has evolved to interact with a different set of bnacbls. presumably, different combinations of cbl-cipks respond to different exogenous and endogenous cues. for instance, in arabidopsis, interaction of cbl1–cipk <dig> is important to regulate salt stress, while interaction of cbl9–cipk <dig> is essential for responses to aba  <cit> . research with the cbl-cipk network in arabidopsis and canola presented here suggests that there may be other factors that confer specificity to cipk activity, which cannot be simply determined through y2h detection of physical interactions with cbls. one such factor could be cytosolic ca2+ concentration , since previous studies have demonstrated that different arabidopsis cbl proteins show differential calcium binding efficiencies and cbl-cipk complex formation may depend on ca2+]cyt. for instance, free atcbl <dig> binds only two ca2+ ions, however, when it forms a complex with cipk <dig>  all four ef hands are occupied by ca2+ ions  <cit> . in contrast, atcbl <dig> can bind four ca2+ ions in a free state and binds only two ca2+ ions upon interaction with cipk <dig>  <cit> .

bimolecular fluorescence complementation  assay of cbl-cipk interactions using yellow fluorescent protein 
we used bifc to confirm in planta some of the interactions we observed between canola cbls and cipks, in the y2h assay. we chose three bnacipks:  because their orthologous genes are among the least-well characterized cipks in arabidopsis. co-expression of yfp
n
-bnacipk and bnacbl-yfpc fusion genes or yfpc alone in leaf epidermal cells of n. benthamiana were performed through agrobacteria-mediated transformation. we observed that yellow fluorescence signals appeared in infiltrated leaf epidermal cells of n. benthamiana when bnacipk <dig> and bnacbl <dig> were co-expressed . in contrast, in controls in which a non-interacting cbl <dig> partner was used, no yellow signal was observed . yfp signals also appeared when bnacipk <dig> and bnacbl <dig>  - <dig>  or - <dig> were co-expressed , while no signal of reconstructed yfp appeared in the control assay when yfp
n
-cipk <dig> was expressed together with yfpc only . in addition, we observed strong yfp signal when bnacipk <dig> was co-expressed together with bnacbl <dig> , and in control leaf cells that expressed bnacipk <dig> and bnacbl <dig>  we did not observe any yfp signal . as for the intracellular locations of different cbl/cipk complexes, research with arabidopsis cbl/cipk complexes shows that distinct targeting signals are located in the n-terminal domain of cbl proteins, for instance, the n-terminal mgcxxs/t motif mediating lipid modification by myristoylation and palmitoylation , determine the spatial localization of cbl/cipk complexes  <cit> . our aforementioned gfp study demonstrated that bnacbl <dig> is located in the plasma membrane and nucleus, bnacbl <dig> in cytoplasm and nuclei, and bnacbl <dig> at the tonoplast. these observations, when combined with the bifc results, allowed us to infer that the bnacbl1/cipk <dig> complex formed at the plasma membrane. however, the exact localization of other four bnacbl/cipk complexes could not be accurately determined as bnacbl <dig>  - <dig> localizations are not known yet. nevertheless, part of the interaction patterns of bnacbl-cipk from our y2h are all confirmed by the in planta bifc assays, indicating the general reliability of the methods used here.

examining the domains of cipk mediating interaction with cbl
previous studies have shown that a short motif called naf or fisl located in the c-terminal regulatory domain of cipks is necessary and sufficient for mediating interactions with cbls  <cit> . to test this in the canola cbl-cipk network, we generated a series of deletion constructs  by cloning bnacipk <dig> fragments into the pgadt <dig> activation domain vector . these constructs were then transformed separately into yeast cells harboring pgbkt7-bnacbl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  or - <dig> plasmid, respectively, and interactions were assayed by growth on selective medium as an activation of nutritional marker gene his <dig> and lacz reporter gene . the results demonstrated that bnacipk3-d <dig> or bnacipk3-d <dig> protein, which did not contain the naf/fisl motif , did not interact with any of the five bnacbls tested . this indicates that deletion of a naf/fisl motif from bnacipk <dig> is sufficient to abolish the interactions with cbls. on the other hand, bnacipk3-d <dig>  which contains the n-terminal kinase domain plus naf/fisl motif, interacted strongly with bnacbl <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  but weakly with bnacbl <dig> and did not interact with bnacbl <dig> . bnacipk-d <dig>  which contains the c-terminal region plus naf/fisl motif, showed interactions with all of the five bnacbls assayed . in addition, the d <dig> construct harboring only the naf/fisl motif of bnacipk <dig> showed significant interactions with bnacbl <dig> and - <dig>  but not with bnacbl <dig>  - <dig> or - <dig> for unknown reasons . as a control, yeast cells transformed with any of the five pgbkt7-bnacbl plasmids and the empty pgadt <dig>  plasmid did not show any growth on the selective medium sd-ltha, indicating that observed interactions had high specificity . in addition, yeast cells expressing the full-length  bnacipk <dig> and four of the five bnacbl genes showed good growth on the selective medium, except bnacbl <dig>  which showed limited growth for unknown reasons . we therefore hypothesized that other region of some specific cipk protein may also determine the interaction with cbl proteins. a previous study showed that the n-terminal region of cipks is also involved in determining the specificity of cbl-cipk interaction  <cit> .

expression analysis of bnacbl and bnacipk genes in response to abiotic stress and hormone stimulus
to investigate whether bnacbl and bnacipk genes are involved in canola responses to abiotic stresses and stress hormone-aba, quantitative rt-pcr was used to analyze expression patterns of six bnacbl and  <dig> bnacipk genes in  <dig> d old canola seedlings under salt, cold, heat, oxidative , drought, low potassium  stress treatments as well exogenous aba application .

data from three biological replicates showed that in salt-treated canola seedlings, bnacbl <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were down-regulated at the 6 h time-point and the other three bnacbl genes did not show significant changes at either time point tested. bnacbl <dig> transcript level showed a significant increase 6 h after cold treatment, however, it was down-regulated at 24 h time-point. in 24 h cold-treated seedlings, only bnacbl <dig> was still slightly up-regulated and expression of the bnacbl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> were down-regulated. however, bnacbl <dig> expression seemed not to be affected by cold treatment at  <dig> or 24 h time-point. as for heat treatment, it induced the expression of bnacbl <dig> and - <dig> at both time-points and 24 h time-point only, respectively. on the other hand, heat stress significantly down-regulated the expression levels of bnacbl <dig> at 6 h time-point. under the treatment of methyl viologen , a reagent that induces the production of oxidative stress, no bnacbl genes showed significant changes at either time-point assayed. in aba-treated canola seedlings, no bnacbl genes were significantly induced while bnacbl <dig> was repressed at 6 h time-point. drought or water deficiency stress increased accumulation of bnacbl <dig> transcripts and down-regulated bnacbl <dig> expression at 24 h time-point. lastly, lk treatment significantly down-regulated bnacbl <dig> expression at the early 6 h time-point, however, it slightly increased the expression levels of bnacbl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> at 24 h time-point .

as for the  <dig> bnacipk genes assayed, among the seven treatments applied, the most striking induction was observed for bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> after cold treatment . furthermore, the transcript level of bnacipk <dig> gene showed the most significant increases after various stress treatments . salt treatment induced the expression of bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> at either  <dig> or 24 h time-point. in heat-treated seedlings, the expression levels of bnacipk <dig> and - <dig> were up-regulated, whereas those of bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> down-regulated. as for mv treatment, it up-regulated the expression of bnacipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> at 6 h time-point and no significant changes were observed for the other eight bnacipk genes at any time-point. aba treatment up-regulated bnacipk <dig> expression at both time-points, and repressed bnacipk <dig> expression at 6 h time-point. as for drought treatment, only bnacipk <dig> was repressed and bnacipk <dig> induced at both time-points, the others did not show any significant changes. in lk-treated canola roots, the expression levels of bnacipk- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were slightly induced, and no significant changes were observed with the other bnacipk genes at either of the two time-points assayed .

taken together, the expression data of six bnacbl and  <dig> bnacipk genes in canola seedlings or roots after various stress treatments suggests that different cbl or cipk genes may participate in the signaling process to a single stress and, a single cbl or cipk likely plays a role in multiple stress responses.

comparison of expression profiling of cbl and cipk genes in canola, arabidopsis and rice under abiotic stress conditions and aba treatment
keeping in mind that canola cbl and cipk interaction patterns showed differences compared to their orthologs in arabidopsis, we were curious whether responses to of cbl and cipk transcripts to abiotic stress or hormone stimuli also differed between canola, arabidopsis, and rice. to examine the expression profiles of arabidopsis cbl and cipk genes to cold, salt, aba, heat, oxidative and lk stresses, we extracted data from publicly available microarray data sets  <cit> . detailed data sources and results of expression changes of the two family genes in arabidopsis under stress conditions are provided in additional file  <dig>  for the comparison, we focused only on those arabidopsis genes whose orthologs in canola have been cloned and assayed by qrt-pcr as described above. we also limited our analysis to those microarray data sets with described treatments and tissues comparable to what we reported herein, for example, paraquat  but not hydrogen peroxide for oxidative stress, and aerial tissues but not roots. among atcbl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  only atcbl <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were significantly regulated by aba treatment and only atcbl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were significantly regulated by cold stress, with atcbl <dig> up-regulated and the other three down-regulated. we also found that the abundance of only atcbl <dig> and - <dig> transcripts was down-regulated by drought treatment. heat stress  repressed the expression of atcbl <dig> and - <dig> genes. salinity stress, down-regulated the transcription of atcbl <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  atcbl <dig> was slightly up-regulated by mv treatment and no atcbl genes were significantly influenced by lk treatment . compared to our data, we found that responses of bnacbl <dig> gene to cold, heat and drought stresses were similar to atcbl <dig> while the responses of cbl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> showed both very limited consistency between arabidopsis and canola, although there were quite many cbl genes that showed only minor changes under different stress treatments .

for the cipk genes, we found that among the  <dig> cipk genes analyzed both in canola by qrt-pcr  and assayed in arabidopsis through microarray , 56%  of cipk genes were up- or down-regulated under aba treatment, with atcipk <dig> and - <dig> repressed and the other seven induced by aba. cold stress significantly increased the abundance of transcripts of atcipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> while decreased that of atcipk <dig> at a late time-point. on the other hand, atcipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were significantly up-regulated by drought stress, and atcipk <dig> and - <dig> were down-regulated by drought treatment. heat stress significantly increased the transcript abundance of atcipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> among the  <dig> atcipk genes examined. as for salinity treatment, it induced the expression of atcipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and repressed the expression of atcipk- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  however, only atcipk <dig> was up-regulated by oxidative stress and the other  <dig> atcipk genes did not show any significant change to it. lk treatment slightly increased the transcript abundance of atcipk <dig> while decreased that of atcipk <dig> . when the expression profiles of atcipks and bnacipks to these stresses were compared, we found again that both similarities and differences existed between them under specific stress conditions. for example, the responses of cipk <dig> and - <dig> to cold stress were similar in canola and arabidopsis, while those of the other genes were different. salinity stress induced the expression of cipk <dig> and - <dig> both in arabidopsis and canola, however the expression changes of the others were quite different .

we next compared our canola cbl and cipk qrt-pcr data to publically available transcript expression data of these two genes families measured in rice under five different stress conditions  using the rice 57 k microarray datasets  <cit>  with detailed results presented in additional file  <dig>  for the six bnacbl and  <dig> bnacipk genes cloned in the present study, we were only able to identify orthologous pairs for four cbl and  <dig> cipk genes from rice . among the ten oscbl genes, we found that all oscbl genes were up- or down-regulated under one or more stress conditions . for instance, oscbl <dig> and - <dig> were up- and oscbl <dig> was down-regulated by cold stress while oscbl <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were up-regulated by heat treatment. we observed both similarities and differences in responses to abiotic stresses existed between rice and canola cbl orthologs. for example, oscbl <dig> and bnacbl <dig>  an orthologous pair, were induced by cold stress. on the other hand, orthologous oscbl <dig> and bnacbl <dig> were induced and repressed by drought stress treatment, respectively .

among the  <dig> oscipk genes, we found that 94%  of oscipk genes were up-or down-regulated under one or more stress conditions. however, the changes of oscipk <dig> and - <dig> to any stresses were not significant . for example, oscipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  -14/ <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were up-regulated by cold treatment while oscipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and -32/ <dig> were down-regulated by cold stress. higher temperature  significantly induced the expression of oscipk <dig>  - <dig>  -14/ <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and repressed the expression of oscipk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and -32/ <dig>  likewise, when the orthologous pairs between rice and canola were compared, similar changes were observed with some pairs while different responses to abiotic stresses were identified for other pairs. for instance, transcript abundance of oscipk <dig> and oscipk <dig> was increased by drought and cold treatment, respectively, which is similar to their orthologous gene bnacipk <dig> and oscipk <dig>  respectively . on the other hand, oscipk <dig> was down-regulated by cold or heat stress, which is different from its ortholog bnacipk <dig>  oscipk <dig> was also down-regulated by cold treatment, and this is different from its orthologous gene bnacipk <dig>  taken together, the comparative analysis suggested that some orthologous gene pairs between different species may have retained similar functions while others  likely evolved divergent functions in response to abiotic stress or aba stimuli between monocot and dicot species, as supported by a recent research with three basic helix-loop-helix  genes controlling stomatal development  <cit> .

functional analysis of canola cipk <dig> gene in arabidopsis
it had been reported that arabidopsis mutants in the sos pathway, for instance, sos <dig>  sos <dig> and sos <dig>  are specifically hypersensitive to high external na+ concentrations  <cit> . to dissect the biological function of canola cipk genes, we constructed transgenic arabidopsis lines heterologously expressing bnacipk <dig> gene in the sos2- <dig> mutant background for functional complementation test. through qrt–pcr analysis, we confirmed the high level expression of bnacipk <dig> transgene in the sos2- <dig> background . we selected three representative t <dig> generation lines that were independently complemented lines  for phenotypic assays. on normal medium plates, wild type , sos mutants and three complemented lines displayed relatively similar growth phenotypes, although roots of the sos2- <dig> seedlings were slightly shorter . when treated with 50 mm nacl, growth of sos <dig> was inhibited compared with wild type plants. expression of bnacipk <dig> in sos2- <dig> substantially alleviated the growth retardation imposed by moderate salt stress . under 100 mm nacl treatment, growth inhibition of sos <dig> mutants was even more pronounced. however, the sos2- <dig> mutants expressing bnacipk <dig> could survive much better . statistical analysis of root elongation showed that all the three complementation lines were generally restored to a wild-type level of salt tolerance, which is highly correlated to the expression level of the transgene in arabidopsis . these data indicate the canola cipk <dig> gene could substitute for the corresponding arabidopsis cipk <dig>  component, and is a functional ortholog of its arabidopsis counterpart.

CONCLUSIONS
during their evolution, plants have acquired a set of complex and highly tuned signal transduction pathways to respond to adverse environmental conditions. research during the last few decades has revealed that calcium signaling is as an integral process that enables plants to respond to numerous external stimuli and coordinate essential processes. the cbl–cipk network is an important example of a plant calcium signaling pathway  <cit> . cbl–cipk network members in arabidopsis and rice have been demonstrated to act as convergence points or master switches for distinct signals, for example, arabidopsis cipk <dig> positively regulates both potassium and nitrate nutrition  <cit>  and arabidopsis cipk24/sos <dig> activates transporters that extrude toxic sodium ions from the cytoplasm to the apoplast or the vacuole through alternative interactions with cbl <dig> or cbl <dig>  respectively  <cit> . although functions of some members of arabidopsis or rice cbl and cipk have been studied, functions of many cbls and cipks from arabidopsis and rice remain uncharacterized to date. in addition, our understanding of the cbl–cipk network in other plants remains fragmentary. so far, no systematic analysis of the cbl or cipk family genes has been reported in the important oil crop canola.

in this present study, we carried out a detailed survey of the two gene families in canola and characterized them on the bases of phylogenetic relationship, conserved protein motifs, gene duplication, interactions between them and expression profiles to abiotic stress and the stress hormone aba treatments. we found that each canola cbl and cipk exhibited differential responses to multiple stress treatments, suggesting that they were major convergence points for cross-talk between different signal transduction pathways. on the other hand, multiple cipks seemed to be necessary to coordinate with one specific stress stimulus. for instance, transcription of eight canola cipk genes appeared to be affected by cold treatment, indicating the involvement of multiple cbl-cipk signaling pathways in response to cold stress. in addition, we comparatively analyzed the expression profiles of putative orthologous or paralogous pairs existing in the cbl or cipk family genes of canola, arabidopsis and rice under different stress or hormone treatments. therefore, our genomic, bioinformatic and experimental analyses of the two family genes and proteins provide a solid foundation for the further functional characterization of the cbl-cipk network involving in decoding calcium signals under different stress conditions. taken together, by further understanding the functions and inner mechanisms of the cbl–cipk network in canola through virus-induced gene silencing  and overexpression, as underway in our lab, we would be able to elucidate how the canola cbl–cipk network enables integration of multiple signals of the plant’s environment and coordinates downstream responses to stresses such as toxic ion exposure, extreme temperatures and nutrient deprivation.
