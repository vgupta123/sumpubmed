BACKGROUND
an efficient and precisely controlled dna-damage response is crucial for cell survival. in mammalian cells, the p <dig> regulatory pathway, consisting mainly of the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> and its downstream transcriptional targets, plays an essential role in mediating this crucial stress response to chromosomal damage  <cit> . depending on the type and severity of dna damage, the p <dig> pathway activates either cell-cycle arrest that allows repair of the damage or alternatively, death of the cell through apoptosis, but the mechanism by which variation in dna-damage strength differentially regulates p <dig> pathway dynamics, and the effect that this has on cell fate, are poorly understood.

mild dna damage generally induces a moderate increase in p <dig> level, and results in transient cell-cycle arrest that allows damage repair, whereas severe and possibly irreparable dna damage leads to a large increase in p <dig>  followed by cell death  <cit> . dna damage is known to upregulate p <dig> by attenuating its interaction with mdm <dig>  the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that targets p <dig> for proteasome-mediated degradation  <cit> . less clear is how the severity of dna damage modulates the degree of attenuation in p53-mdm <dig> interactions, giving rise to differential p <dig> expression that results in these alternative cell fates. also not clear is how the dynamics of p <dig> differ with variation in damage level, and what role any changes in the dynamics might play in the downstream function of p <dig>  most previous studies of p <dig> dynamics have focused only on the response to transient dna damage induced by gamma or uv irradiation, which has been shown to induce an intriguing oscillatory behavior of p <dig>  which is largely independent of dna damage level  <cit> . moreover, although recent results, including our own  <cit> , have shown that p <dig> dynamics can be altered by using nutlin to inhibit mdm <dig>  the observed change in p <dig> dynamics was again independent of damage severity.

to investigate whether and how dna-damage strength modulates p <dig> dynamics and subsequently alters cell-fate outcome, we performed a dose–response study by measuring the real-time p <dig> dynamics under variable dna damage generated by etoposide, a chemotherapeutic compound that induces sustained dna damage. using time-lapse microscopy, we quantified p <dig> dynamics at the single-cell level, and correlated the dynamics with cell fates. our results showed that p <dig> dynamics exhibit ‘switch-like’ behavior, changing from oscillatory dynamics at low damage to monotonic increase at high damage. moreover, this damage dose-dependent, bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics was found to regulate cell fate mainly by modulating the p <dig> induction level and its pro-apoptotic activities as a function of dna-damage strength. our results suggest that under certain conditions, p <dig> oscillations may act as a mechanism to suppress p <dig> induction, thereby restraining its pro-apoptotic activities and promoting cell-cycle arrest that allows dna-damage repair.

RESULTS
dynamics of nuclear p <dig> is damage dose-dependent
to obtain data on p <dig> dynamics and cell fate as a function of dna-damage strength, we performed dose titration of a dna-damaging drug, etoposide, on u- <dig> os cells expressing a fluorescent p <dig> reporter. the reporter cell line was generated by infecting u- <dig> os cells with lentivirus encoding an established wild-type p53-venus reporter construct  <cit> . for the study, we selected an isogenic clone that exhibited behaviors most similar to the parental line . we used etoposide as the dna-damage stimulus, as it is known to trigger dna double-strand breaks  by inhibiting topoisomerase ii  <cit> . to select the appropriate range of etoposide dosage for activating variable amounts of dna damage, we first measured the level of dna damage under different etoposide doses. dna damage, as indicated by the dna-damage marker, phospho-h2a.x, was present after  <dig> hours of drug treatment , and the degree of dna damage increased with increasing dosage of etoposide from  <dig> μmol/l to  <dig> to  <dig> μmol/l.

to verify that dynamics of the p53-venus reporter construct in our clonal reporter line mimicked the endogenous p <dig>  we compared the dynamics of the endogenous and fluorescently tagged p <dig> by western blotting. the dynamics of the p53-venus construct that we used have been extensively studied previously in mcf <dig> cells, which all showed that the reporter construct behaved similarly to the endogenous p <dig>  <cit> . our data from the u- <dig> os clone also showed similar induction dynamics between p53-venus and its endogenous counterpart , when cells were treated with both low and high doses of etoposide. therefore, the fluorescent p <dig> reporter is probably regulated similarly to the endogenous wild-type p <dig>  and can be used to infer p <dig> dynamics in response to dna damage.

from time-lapse microscopy movies, we quantified the real-time induction dynamics of p <dig> by measuring average venus fluorescence in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. in general, the fluorescent signal of p53-venus in the nucleus was significantly higher than that in the cytoplasm. single-cell p <dig> fluorescence trajectories showed two distinctive dynamic features: 1) nuclear p <dig> exhibited periodic pulsing at low drug dose, but monotonic increase at high dose; and 2) the amplitude of monotonically elevated p <dig> was substantially higher than that of the pulsing mode . these bimodal, damage dose-dependent p <dig> dynamics are in stark contrast to the dose-independent oscillatory response of p <dig> to gamma irradiation previously identified in single mammalian cells  <cit> . the observation of a switch from oscillatory dynamics to a monotonic increase in p <dig> as dna damage increased also suggests an intriguing new transitional regulation of p <dig> 

the distinct mode of p <dig> dynamics strongly correlates with cell fate
besides p <dig> dynamics, cumulative survival curves  showed that cell fate was also altered. as the dose of etoposide increased from  <dig> to  <dig> μmol/l, the cell-fate profile shifted from primarily cell-cycle arrest  to primarily cell death, with  <dig> μmol/l being the saturating dose for the cell-death response . the dose response of the u- <dig> os p <dig> reporter line was similar to that of the parental line, with the reporter line being slightly more sensitive to etoposide, probably due to the extra copies of p <dig> . moreover, the single-cell data from the reporter line showed that the phenotypic outcome of arrest versus death correlated strongly with the dynamic mode of p <dig>  as overall 86% of the cells  that showed p <dig> pulsing went into cell-cycle arrest, and more than 96% of those with monotonic p <dig> induction died. figure 2b shows the distributions of the four observed response phenotypes at different etoposide doses: 1) pulsing p <dig> followed by cell-cycle arrest, 2) pulsing p <dig> followed by cell death, 3) monotonic increase of p <dig> followed by cell-cycle arrest, and 4) monotonic increase of p <dig> followed by cell death. at all etoposide doses, phenotypes  <dig> and  <dig> accounted for more than 85% of the cells seen. in particular, at low dna damage , more than 65% of cells showed periodic pulsing and cell-cycle arrest, whereas at high dna damage  more than 95% cells died after monotonic elevation of p <dig> 

to determine whether other mammalian cells exhibit a bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics that correlates with cell fate as a function of dna-damage strength, we generated another clonal fluorescent p <dig> reporter cell line in a <dig> cells. dose titration results of the a549-p <dig> reporter line showed that a <dig> was more resistant than u- <dig> os to etoposide, requiring higher concentrations to induce both cell-cycle arrest  and cell death  to near saturation level . in a <dig> cells, p <dig> again showed a bimodal switch of dynamics similar to that observed in u- <dig> os cells, namely, pulsing at low dna damage and monotonic increase at high dna damage . the strong correlation between cell fate and the two distinct p <dig> dynamic modes was also seen in a <dig> cells . overall, 97% of a <dig> cells that displayed p <dig> pulsing went into cell-cycle arrest, and more than 83% of those with monotonic p <dig> induction died. our data thus suggest that the bimodal switch and its correlation with alternative cell fate are common in at least some mammalian cells in response to variable dna damage.

we noted that although the correlation between cell fate and p <dig> induction dynamics was evident across the entire cell population, there was strong cell-to-cell variation in terms of the quantitative characteristics. we quantified the single-cell data and population average for the two p <dig> dynamic modes observed in u- <dig> os cells at different etoposide concentrations . for the pulsing mode, the pulsing period of the initial two to five pulses varied between individual cells from approximately  <dig> to approximately  <dig> hours, and the pulsing amplitude spanned a nearly eight-fold range. furthermore, more than 50% of cells displayed irregular oscillatory behaviors with change in either pulsing period or amplitude over time. the strong single-cell variability was also evident for the monotonic induction mode, as shown by the large standard deviations in the population averages in terms of both the rate of p <dig> increase and the maximal p <dig> level . in addition, our results appeared to show distinct dose dependence of the two p <dig> dynamic modes. both the average pulsing period and the pulsing amplitude exhibited a moderate increase as the etoposide concentration increased, whereas the rate of increase and the maximal p <dig> level under the monotonic induction mode was largely dose-independent.

mdm <dig> expression level controls the dynamic mode of p <dig> induction
p <dig> level is known to be negatively regulated by the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase mdm <dig>  while at the same time mdm <dig> is transcriptionally activated by p <dig>  such a negative feedback loop between p <dig> and mdm <dig> maintains p <dig> at a low level in unstressed cells. upon induction of dna damage, the inhibitory interaction between p <dig> and mdm <dig> is disrupted by phosphorylation of both proteins, resulting in p <dig> accumulation  <cit> . to test whether the bimodal switch of p <dig> induction is a result of differences in mdm <dig> activation, we performed immunoblotting to compare the dynamics of ensemble p <dig> and mdm <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> μmol/l etoposide, as under these two extreme concentrations, cells largely exhibited the same p <dig> dynamics of either pulsing or monotonic increase. the level of p <dig> increase was substantially higher at high drug dose than low dose for u- <dig> os cells , agreeing with the live-cell imaging observations. intriguingly, whereas expression of mdm <dig> steadily increased at  <dig> μmol/l etoposide, its expression was largely suppressed at  <dig> μmol/l. our data thus indicate that attenuation in upregulation of mdm <dig> at high dna damage may enable p <dig> to accumulate continuously to a high level, exhibiting monotonic elevation that is fundamentally different from the pulsing mode triggered by low damage.

to further confirm the role of mdm <dig> in regulating the bimodal p <dig> dynamics, we attenuated mdm <dig> activity in u- <dig> os cells by using either rna interference  knockdown or nutlin- <dig>  a small-molecule inhibitor of mdm <dig>  <cit> , and compared the resulting p <dig> dynamics and cell fate with those after treatment of  <dig> μmol/l etoposide alone . mdm <dig> knockdown efficiencies were generally greater than 90%, and mdm <dig> knockdown alone  increased p <dig> to a level similar to that seen with  <dig> μmol/l etoposide alone . approximately 70% of u- <dig> os cells under mdm <dig> knockdown alone continued to divide, and less than 10% cell death occurred in the  <dig> hours of the imaging experiment. figure 3c compares the distributions of the four different phenotypes, as discussed above, after treatment with  <dig> μmol/l etoposide plus one of the following four conditions: control , control sirna , mdm <dig> knockdown, and  <dig> μmol/l nutlin- <dig>  we chose to use  <dig> μmol/l nutlin- <dig> because at this concentration nutlin- <dig> alone induced little cell death . control sirna transfection slightly sensitized cells to etoposide-induced cell death , but did not alter distribution of the phenotypic responses, with about 90% of cells exhibiting pulsing p <dig> followed by cell-cycle arrest, similar to that of control cells. by contrast, mdm <dig> knockdown not only significantly upregulated p <dig> level  and changed the mode of p <dig> dynamics from being approximately 90% oscillatory to approximately 95% monotonic increase, but also shifted cell fate from approximately 90% cell-cycle arrest to approximately 80% cell death . similar changes in p <dig> dynamics and cell fate were also seen with etoposide plus nutlin- <dig>  these data strongly suggest that the bimodal p <dig> dynamics are generated by differential mdm <dig> upregulation modulated by dna-damage strength, and that the bimodal switch functions as a crucial control over arrest versus death, as cell fate can be altered by changing p <dig> dynamics.

attenuation of mdm <dig> expression at high dna damage could be due to reduced gene transcription or translation, or increased protein degradation. real-time quantitative pcr  results of mdm <dig> showed that the gene-expression level of mdm <dig> was largely similar under low and high etoposide concentrations . therefore, the distinct mdm <dig> expression that we observed at the protein level in response to variable dna-damage strength is not due to differential gene expression, but possibly due to differences in translation or mdm <dig> protein degradation, such as by hausp  <cit>  and atm  <cit> .

bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics modulates the overall transcriptional activity of p53
p <dig> is known to modulate cell fate through both its transcriptional activity in the nucleus, which upregulates downstream target genes, and its transcription-independent pro-apoptotic activity in the cytoplasm  <cit> . to determine whether the bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics exerts control over alternative cell fates by modulating the transcriptional activity of p <dig> in upregulating distinct pro-survival and pro-death genes, we measured, by real-time qpcr, the gene-expression dynamics of a set of well-characterized p <dig> target genes that are known to regulate cellular response to dna damage  <cit> . these target genes include those involved in cell-cycle arrest  and gadd45a), dna repair , senescence   <cit>  and apoptosis . all target genes that we profiled, except bax , showed much higher upregulation in response to high dna damage , when p <dig> was strongly elevated in the monotonic mode, irrespective of their particular functions. of the three most highly induced genes under monotonic p <dig> in response to high dna damage were two cell-cycle arrest genes, that is, cdkn1a  and gadd45a , and one pro-death gene, noxa .

to further confirm the similar induction dynamics of pro-survival and pro-death genes at the protein level, we compared, by western blotting, expression levels of p <dig> , puma, and bax from u- <dig> os cells treated with  <dig> μmol/l  and  <dig> μmol/l  etoposide. expression of both the pro-survival gene p <dig> and the pro-death gene puma were significantly induced under both low and high dna-damage levels, whereas expression of another important pro-death gene, bax, was not upregulated . these largely agreed with the qpcr data. hence, our results suggest that the bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics modulates the transcriptional activation of pro-survival and pro-death genes similarly, and do not differentially activate these distinct genes in a damage dose-dependent manner. the observed bimodal switch did not appear to regulate cell fate through the previously reported mechanisms of differential transactivation of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic promoters  <cit> , or through the p53-mediated transrepression of pro-survival genes  <cit> . instead, our data point to a mechanism in which pulsing p <dig> retains a low level of p <dig> with target gene expression sufficient only for inhibiting cell-cycle progression, whereas the monotonic p <dig> results in strong induction of p <dig> that activates sufficiently high levels of pro-death genes to trigger cell death, superseding the concomitant cell-cycle arrest response.

bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics modulates the p <dig> cytoplasmic localization, and this correlates with the pro-apoptotic activity
the single-cell imaging data showed that although under low etoposide dosage the cytoplasmic p <dig> signal was close to that of the fluorescence background, there was an observable increase in cytoplasmic p <dig> fluorescence in response to high drug dosage, although the majority of the activated p <dig> was localized in the nucleus under both conditions. shown in figure 5a are representative single-cell trajectories of p <dig> fluorescence in the cytoplasm, relative to that in the nucleus from u- <dig> os cells treated with  <dig> μmol/l etoposide. the average p <dig> fluorescence in the cytoplasm was found to be about 10% of that in the nucleus. cell-to-cell variability was again evident, with the abundance of cytoplasmic p <dig> ranging from about 5% to 25% of that in the nucleus. the single-cell data indicated that the cytoplasmic accumulation of p <dig>  which may be proportional to the cytoplasmic pro-apoptotic activity of p <dig>  was modulated by the bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics as a function of dna-damage strength.

to determine the level of cytoplasmic p <dig> at the ensemble level, we performed subcellular fractionation. using western blotting, we compared levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic p <dig> in u- <dig> os cells treated with no drug,  <dig> μmol/l and  <dig> μmol/l etoposide, respectively . tubulin and transcriptional factor ii b  were used as cytoplasmic and nuclear markers to confirm the quality of fractionation. in contrast to cells treated with  <dig> μmol/l etoposide, in which little cytoplasmic p <dig> was detected, treatment with  <dig> μmol/l etoposide induced substantial accumulation of cytoplasmic p <dig> . the level of cytoplasmic p <dig> correlated with the differential cell fate, that is, more than 90% cell-cycle arrest at low damage, where cytoplasmic p <dig> was low, and more than 95% cell death at high damage, where cytoplasmic p <dig> was significant. these data thus suggest that in addition to the transcriptional activation of pro-death genes, bimodal switching of p <dig> dynamics may also regulate cell fate by modulating cytoplasmic accumulation of p <dig>  which possibly correlates with its pro-apoptotic activity in the cytoplasm, as dna damage increases.

besides the induction level, activities of p <dig> are also known to be regulated extensively by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation  <cit> . previous studies have identified several post-translational modifications on p <dig> that play crucial roles in regulating differential cell fate, such as ser- <dig> phosphorylation by chk1/chk <dig>  <cit> , ser- <dig> phosphorylation by hipk <dig>  <cit> , lys- <dig> acetylation by tip <dig>  <cit> , and lys- <dig> acetylation by cbp/p <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether these modifications affect the cytoplasmic accumulation of p <dig>  we measured, by western blotting, the above four post-translational modifications in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of p <dig>  respectively . whereas the extent of p <dig> phosphorylation at serine- <dig> and serine- <dig> was largely proportional to the expression level of p <dig>  irrespective of the sub-celluar localization, the cytoplasmic fraction of p <dig> appeared to be preferentially modified by acetylation at lysine- <dig> and lysine- <dig>  indicating that these two post-translational modifications may potentially have important roles in regulating p <dig> translocation to cytoplasm and/or its cytoplasmic pro-apoptotic activity.

discussion
our observations that p <dig> dynamics can switch modes in a damage dose-dependent manner, and that cell fate can be altered by changing the dynamic mode of p <dig>  reveal a new mechanism by which the p <dig> pathway regulates differential dna-damage responses. by examining both the transcriptional and non-transcriptional functions of p <dig> at distinct damage levels, we further determined that the bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics regulates differential cell fate, mainly by modulating the p <dig> induction level and pro-apoptotic activities. under moderate dna damage, p <dig> undergoes periodic pulsing, which might act to retain a low level of p <dig> induction with low induction of pro-death genes and low cytoplasmic accumulation of p <dig>  in this low damage mode, the p <dig> pro-apoptotic activities are suppressed and cell-cycle arrest dominates. in contrast, a high level of dna damage triggers strong monotonic elevation of p <dig>  which activates high levels of pro-death genes and also promotes the cytoplasmic accumulation of p <dig>  in this high damage mode, the overall pro-apoptotic activities of p <dig> increase, resulting in cell death and superseding the cell-cycle arrest response. our data not only point to the bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics as a crucial control over cell fate in response to variable dna damage, but also suggest that p <dig> oscillations probably function as a suppressor through maintaining a low induction level of p <dig>  which suppresses its pro-apoptotic activities and renders cell-cycle arrest that allows repair at the time of low dna damage.

the fact that p <dig> fundamentally changes its dynamic mode, that is, switching from pulsing at low damage to monotonic increase at high damage, poses important new questions regarding the transitional behavior and regulation of p <dig> pathway dynamics. for instance, what is the crucial damage intensity that triggers the change in p <dig> dynamics? which p <dig> pathway components control this crucial damage threshold? is the bimodal transition sharp or gradual as a function of damage level? answering these questions will probably require analysis of the larger p <dig> pathway beyond the p53-mdm <dig> negative feedback loop, so as to obtain knowledge of other feedback structures in the p <dig> regulatory pathway, such as those involved in damage sensing, p <dig> upregulation, and modification. by perturbing key feedback components connected to the central p53-mdm <dig> loop and examining how the threshold, quantitative characteristics, and single-cell variability of the p <dig> bimodal switch are altered, a more quantitative understanding of the bimodal switch will be acquired. to identify the regulatory dependence of the bimodal switch on particular pathway motifs, investigations that combine experimental measurements and theoretical analysis of the pathway dynamics are clearly needed. we believe results from such further investigations will provide important insights into novel strategies of signaling-pathway control that may be common in mammalian cells.

although our results showed that differential mdm <dig> upregulation was responsible for altering p <dig> dynamics, the exact mechanism by which mdm <dig> is differentially regulated has not been determined. we found that attenuation of mdm <dig> expression at high dna damage was not due to reduction in gene transcription, suggesting that reduction in translation or increased protein degradation may be the potential molecular regulators. work by stommel and wahl  <cit>  showed that auto-degradation of mdm <dig> is regulated by dna-damage kinases, such as atm. this suggests one possible mechanism for the observed attenuation in mdm <dig> in response to high dna damage, is that as dna damage increases, further elevation of atm activity triggers additional phosphorylation of mdm <dig>  promoting the auto-degradation of mdm <dig> and thus reducing its protein level. further study will be required to determine the detailed involvement of increased mdm <dig> degradation in light of the bimodal regulation of p <dig>  moreover, we identified differential post-translational modifications of p <dig> in the nucleus and cytoplasm as a function of dna-damage dose, in particular for acetylation of p <dig> at lysine- <dig> and lysine- <dig>  however, important questions remain, which require further, more detailed mechanistic study, regarding whether and how these two, or additional, post-translational modifications regulatep <dig> control over cell fate through modulating its cytoplasmic localization and/or its cytoplasmic pro-apoptotic activity.

our study has shed new light on how the dual functions of p <dig> are modulated as a function of dna-damage strength and differentially contribute to the alternative phenotypic outcome, as we found alteration in p <dig> dynamics mainly affects the p <dig> induction level and its pro-apoptotic activities in a damage dose-dependent manner. although the decision between cell-cycle arrest and cell death mediated by the bimodal p <dig> dynamics was mainly determined by the level of p <dig> pro-apoptotic activities for the system that we studied, it is likely that the p <dig> pathway-mediated dna-damage responses vary depending on the dna-damage stimulus and the cell type investigated. therefore, single-cell p <dig> studies for additional damage stimuli and cell types are needed to examine potential variability in both the bimodal switch and its regulatory effect on the dual functions of p <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, using highly quantitative single-cell microscopy assays, we elucidated a novel mechanism by which dna damage activates a bimodal switch of p <dig> dynamics in a damage dose-dependent manner, subsequently regulating alternative phenotypic outcome of cell-cycle arrest and cell death. our findings not only provide important new insights into understanding the differential dna-damage response mediated by p <dig>  but also produce quantitative new data for exploring the transitional behavior and regulation of p <dig> pathway dynamics for cell-fate control.
