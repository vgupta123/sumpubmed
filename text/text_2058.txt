BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica subspecies enterica is an important zoonotic pathogen of warm-blooded vertebrates, with both a broad host species range and geographical distribution. the subspecies is divided into over  <dig> serovars based on the different epitopes of two surface antigens, the o lipopolysaccharide, and h flagellum of which there are commonly two phases  <cit> .

some serovars display association with a particular set of hosts that may be stable over many decades and large geographical distances suggesting a level of adaptation or restriction  <cit> . with regard to serovars s. derby and s. mbandaka, both serovars are isolated with similar frequency in the uk and usa. annually compiled statistics from several sources  <cit>   showed that, whilst both serovars can readily cause disease in people, incidences in livestock show differing host associations. in the uk, for example, approximately 50% and 40% of incidences of s. derby are in turkeys and pigs, respectively, and approximately 20% and 65% of incidences of s. mbandaka are from cattle and chickens, respectively  <cit> . in the usa approximately 80% of isolation of s. derby are from pigs, while only 3% of isolations were from turkeys, 27% and 25% of s. mbandaka isolations are from cattle and chickens. unlike in the uk in the usa s. mbandaka is isolated from pigs comprising 14% of the total  <cit> . these host distributions have been maintained for over a decade and on two continents which gives rise to at least two hypotheses. first, is it possible that the differences in host association may relate to production systems and that these serotypes posses similar functional capabilities. second, is it possible that the differences in host association reflect functional differences between serovars or genovars therein, whereby there exist bacterially encoded mechanisms that maintain these patterns. as a starting point to tackle these opposing hypotheses, we present the first full chromosome sequence of two uk isolates of both s. derby and s. mbandaka. we use functional genomics to describe genome features and to identify genes that are unique with a view to gaining insights into potential genetic components that contribute to the species distributions described above.

RESULTS
the chromosomes of two strains of s. derby and s. mbandaka were sequenced and compared with the goal of identifying potential mechanistic differences between the two serovars that could explain their skewed isolation frequencies from subsets of livestock species in the uk. strains were obtained from background monitoring performed by the animal health and veterinary laboratories agency  in the uk between  <dig> and  <dig>  in total  <dig> strains were selected spanning the decade and from differing geographic points of isolation across the uk . the hosts of isolation of the selected strains were chosen to reflect the two most common hosts of each serovar, for s. derby these were pigs and turkeys and for s. mbandaka cows and chickens. two isolates of each serovar isolated from separate geographical locations, with the same host species, and identical mlst sequence types  were chosen for full genome sequencing. we recognised that in the absence of information regarding the pan-genome of the population, that by comparing just two isolates of each serovar, we could potentially infer, incorrectly, that differences in gene complement between isolates of the same serovar isolated from different hosts were adaptations to these different hosts. the selection was therefore made with the aim of better understanding the genomic differences between strains which would typically be considered clonal. s. derby strains d <dig> and d <dig> were both isolated in  <dig> from porcine hosts. s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> were isolated from cattle in  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. no research has previously been performed on these strains.

general genome features of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m2
s. derby strains d <dig> and d <dig> possessed chromosomes of  <dig>  mb nucleotides in length with a gc skew of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. the rast annotation system predicted that the chromosome sequence of s. derby d <dig> encodes  <dig> genes and the sequence of d <dig>  <dig> genes. the chromosome of s. mbandaka strains m <dig> and m <dig> were both  <dig>  mb nucleotides in length with a gc skew of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. these were predicted to encode  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively. interestingly all four chromosomes contain different numbers of rna coding sequences, d <dig> contains  <dig>  d <dig> contains  <dig>  m <dig> contains  <dig> and m <dig> contains  <dig> . rna sequences are frequently sights for integration of horizontally acquired dna sequences, in some cases leading to duplication of the rna  <cit> . the difference in the number of rnas in each genome could reflect a difference in evolutionary potential of each chromosome.

s. mbandaka contains a large sequence inversion
s. mbandaka contains a 860kb sequence inversion between a mobile element protein and trna-ser-gga  which was also found in s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig>  and was absent from s. derby  and other sequenced s. enterica serovars including s. agona sl <dig>  s. dublin ct <dig>  s. enteritidis p <dig>  s. gallinarum  <dig> and s. typhimurium lt <dig> and sl <dig>  this region codes for  <dig> genes identified by the rast gene caller. large sequence inversions have a significant impact on the transcript composition of the cell during replication, as those genes closer to the origin of replication are present in duplicate for a longer period of time than those genes closer to the terminus of replication  <cit> . the effects of increased gene dosage during replication are most noticeable when bacteria are growing at an optimal rate  <cit> . in escherichia coli dna replication from the origin of replication to terminus of replication takes 22 minutes during a 40 minute cell cycle when grown in lb broth at 37°c  <cit> . if we apply this duration to the inversion found in s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  where almost a quarter of the chromosome is in a different orientation to s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  then there is an  <dig>  minute difference between gene duplication events of the genes adjacent to the sites of inversion. these genes are therefore in duplicate and the other genes in singlet for 21% of the cell cycle. in s. derby the ten genes closest to the mobile genetic element signifying the start of the inverted sequences do not pertain to a common mechanism. though interestingly, amongst these ten genes is a permease of the drug/metabolite transporter  superfamily which in s. mbandaka occupies the very furthest gene in the inversion. the ten genes at the terminus of the inversion in the chromosome of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> comprise of two operons, the csg-curli operon  and ycd-swarming operon . the most interesting aspect of these two operons is that they are associated with two diametrically opposed mechanisms; the curli operon is associated with biofilm development in a sessile population and the swarming operon is associated with directed movement of the bacterial population, both using quorum sensing  <cit> . both are population scale emergent phenotypes of gene regulation at a single cell level. csgd found in the curli operon regulates both curli expression and cellulose secretion, the main components of biofilms in salmonella enterica <cit> . the ten genes at the centre of inversion and therefore in similar dosage throughout replication in s. derby and s. mbandaka are genes for formate dehydrogenase alpha, beta and gamma subunits which form a single transmembrane enzyme  <cit> . also contained within this region is a permease of the drug/metabolite transporter  superfamily. the ten genes at either end and in the centre of the sequence inversion can be found listed in the supplementary materials .

summary of functional annotation
the chromosome of s. derby is 140 kb longer than that of s. mbandaka, coding for  <dig> additional genes. rast annotation was performed on 9/10/ <dig> and achieved 67% coverage with figfam subsystems of the s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> chromosomes and 68% of the s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . figfam clusters genes based on protein sequence similarity. from this the function of a novel gene may be inferred. these genes are then clustered into hierarchical subsystems that display increasing functional breadth  <cit> . as the database has developed the subsystem coverage of the four genomes presented here has markedly increased by 8-9% over the same annotation performed on the 9/10/ <dig>  the most recent annotation is available through the following rast ids: d <dig> , d <dig> , m <dig>  and m <dig>  so that the chromosome can be re-annotated as the rast databases are updated. the number of hypothetical genes between the annotations remained constant for each chromosome. in all cases almost a quarter of the genome annotation was found to be of hypothetical gene status. s. derby contains  <dig> hypothetical/putative proteins which share less than 90% amino acid sequence homology with open reading frames in s. mbandaka. s. mbandaka contains  <dig> unique hypothetical/putative proteins.

intra-serovar differences in the complement of functionally unique genes
the majority of the diversity between strains of the same serovars was in the complement of phage associated genes. all intra-serovar differences in gene complement can be found listed in the supplementary materials . between the s. derby isolates, d <dig> contains a single unique gene for an aconitate hydratase  <dig>  associated with glyoxylate bypass. d <dig> contains  <dig> unique genes, of which five are associated with phage, the remaining are associated with metabolism. a single gene which is associated with the ribosome at stationary growth phase is absent from d <dig>  there is less diversity between isolates of s. mbandaka. m <dig> contains a single additional gene which encodes a phage tail fibre protein. m <dig> contains six additional genes, two for cytochrome-c biosynthesis, two phage genes and a gene encoding a  <dig> -diketo-d-gluconic acid reductase b .

inter-serovar differences of functionally unique genes
genes pertaining to metabolite utilisation, prophage, crispr spacers and salmonella pathogenicity islands will be dealt with separately. the following summarises the genes that do not fit into these categories. all inter-serovar differences in gene complement can be found listed in the supplementary materials .

salmonella derby
s. derby contains  <dig> genes that are functionally unique. of these  <dig> genes  <dig> are distributed between two operons. one is the mer operon conveying mercury resistance. this consists of five genes including merc and mert transport proteins, which actively take up toxic mercuric cations  for subsequent reduction to non-toxic metallic mercury   <cit> . mecuric cations enter the food chain from several sources, including fish, poultry and meat. animals feed is frequently supplemented in the uk with fish meal which is high in mercury. fish meal contains the second highest concentration of mercury per kg in animal feed/ pet food in europe, with fish oil containing the highest concentration  <cit> . the second operon, is a crispr operon made up of seven genes, one of putative status and cse1-cse <dig>  cas <dig>  cas <dig> and cas5e. of the remaining four genes one is the gene for an udp-galactopyranose mutase  which is associated with the biosynthesis of alpha-d-galactofuranose, a component of the o-antigen in salmonella enterica groups b, c <dig>  d and e  <cit> .

salmonella mbandaka
s. mbandaka contains a cluster of four type vii secretion system yad fimbrial chaperone proteins. two genes with the same function from the htre fimbrial cluster sit approximately 100 kb away. a further 2 mb away at  <dig> u sits a cluster of three beta-fimbriae genes also associated with type vii secretion. three sialic acid metabolism genes associated with capsule production, nanc, nanm and a hypothetical gene, are clustered around 1u. two cell death toxin-antitoxin genes, phd and doc, are unique to m <dig> and m <dig>  and may be involved in plasmid addiction systems. two genes associated with reduction in mutation rate due to exposure to bile salts are absent from s. derby. these genes, umuc and umud are part of the sos dna repair response and form dna polymerase v. it has been shown in e. coli that in the absence of umuc genomic lesions are not repaired correctly by dna polymerase iii and can leave frame shift mutations which lead to pseudogene formation. dna polymerase v has a higher rate of single nucleotide mutations than dna polymerase iii  <cit> . this could lead to a higher rate of pseudogene formation in s. mbandaka strains and snp formation in s. derby strains. however, this would need to be confirmed through further analyses.

there are only seventeen genes that are unique in function to either s. derby or s. mbandaka that are not clustered. of these seventeen genes s. mbandaka contains seven unique genes related to biogenesis of cytochrome-c, specifically the maturation of the molecule, and are spread across the chromosome. the genes ccmb, ccmc and ccmd convey the heme-b group to the product of ccme, a monotopic membrane protein  <cit> . the products of ccmf, ccmg and ccmh complex with ccme to convey the heme-b group to the apocytochrome-c precursor of cytochrome-c  <cit> . though these genes are ubiquitous amongst gram negative bacteria, strains of e. coli have been discovered that lack the ccm operon and yet are able to synthesis cytochrome-c containing heme-b  <cit> .

differences in metabolic gene complement between s. derby and s. mbandaka
fourteen genes were identified by rast subsystem annotations as being involved in primary or secondary metabolism which were found to differ between s. derby and s. mbandaka. six of these genes belong to s. mbandaka are associated with d-galactonate catabolism, this includes uptake, regulation and processing into central carbon metabolism. s. derby contains six genes for the uptake and catabolism of six different carbon sources, this comprises an asparagine synthetase , a hydroxyaromatic non-oxidative decarboxylase protein d , a protein fumarylacetoacetate of the hydrolase family, phosphatase nagd predicted to act inn-acetylglucosamine utilization subsystem, an aconitate hydratase  <dig> , a galactose-specific iia component  and the large subunit of a glycerol dehydratase reactivation factor.

metabolic pathways
the biological significance of the differences in metabolic genes was elaborated through construction of metabolic models from the genome sequences using seedmodel  <cit> . these differences were then elaborated in context of the surrounding reactions. metabolic reconstructions curated with phenotypic data are underway to better understand the effect of secondary metabolism on the optimal growth rate of s. derby d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> 

alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism map  <dig> created 1/6/12
s. derby lacks a single gene, an aspartate—ammonia ligase  for the conversion of l-aspartate to l-asparagine. the same reaction is achievable through two additional reactions utilising an asparaginase/glutaminase  and an l-asparaginase  which are also present in s. mbandaka.

galactose metabolism map  <dig> created 31/5/12
the three genes encoding products needed to feed d-galactonate into glycolysis  by conversion to d-glyceraldehyde-3p are present on the chromosome of s. mbandaka and absent from that of s. derby. there are no alternative routes from d-galactonate to glycolysis.

nitrogen metabolism map  <dig> created 21/8/12
a gene coding for the enzyme l-glutamine amido-ligase that converts l-glutamine to l-glutamate using one molecule of h2o in the process  is missing from the chromosome of s. derby d <dig>  all strains contain a gene that catalyses the same reaction but with the requirement of a molecule of nadp+ as opposed to one of h2o .

starch and sucrose metabolism map  <dig> created 9/7/12
a single reaction is missing from s. mbandaka in this map for the conversion of alpha-d-glucose-1-p to cdp-glucose ; there is no route to this compound other than this on the map. the cdp-glucose then leads into amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism map  <dig> created 19/1/ <dig>  in this map there is an additional reaction from cdp-glucose leading to cdp-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose missing in s. mbandaka. this reaction is catalysed by the enzyme rfbg, a cdp-glucose  <dig> -dehydratase  which is found in salmonella enterica groups a, b, c <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> and required for binding of the o antigen to the core oligosaccharide  <cit> . s. mbandaka is a member of s. enterica group c <dig> 

streptomycin biosynthesis pathway map  <dig> created 27/12/10
two steps from d-glucose-1-p are present in both serovars , following on from the terminal product of this reaction, two additional steps that lead to dtdp-l-rhamnose are missing in s. mbandaka . ddtp-l-rhamnose feeds directly into novobiocin biosynthesis, diverted out of the streptomycin biosynthesis pathway. s. mbandaka is left with a product which feeds into polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis .

salmonella pathogenicity islands
the chromosome of salmonella enterica comprises largely of a core sequence punctuated with horizontally acquired sequences  <cit> . the complement of genomic islands within the chromosome of salmonella enterica can vary amongst isolates of the same serovar  <cit> . it has been postulated that the acquisition of horizontally acquired genes into a salmonella pathogenicity island  led to the divergence of salmonella from escherichia coli <cit> . salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig>  is found in all serovars of s. enterica  and is highly conserved  <cit> . there are currently  <dig> published salmonella pathogenicity islands identified from the genomes of salmonella enterica and salmonella bongori <cit> . the gene content of some of these islands is highly plastic, as exemplified by the different gene complement of spi- <dig> found in s. dublin ct <dig> and s. typhimurium lt <dig>  <cit> . the salmonella pathogenicity islands are well characterised in terms of genetic composition and putative function but less so, with notable exceptions, for their role in pathogenicity  <cit> . hence differences in spi complement and gene content of d <dig>  d <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> chromosomes may hint at mechanisms that maintain their respective host species range.

complete or absent salmonella pathogenicity islands
spis  <dig> and  <dig> found in the genome of s. choloreaesuis sc-b <dig> and spi- <dig> from s. typhi ct <dig> are complete in the genomes of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  spi- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were absent from both s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> genomes.

variation in spi-1of s. derby and s. mbandaka
spi- <dig> in s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> shares 100% nucleotide sequence identity with s. typhumirum lt <dig> with the addition of two orfs coding for hypothetical proteins found in the spi- <dig> of s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig>  sc <dig> and sc <dig> which are absent in s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> lack three genes from spi- <dig> of s. typhimurium lt <dig>  stm <dig>  stm <dig> and stm <dig> . sieve an online server for the prediction of ttss effector proteins, found that the s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> contained an orf with 98% amino acid sequence homology with sc <dig> from s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig>  is a likely candidate for an effector protein with a p-value of  <dig> . with reference to well-characterised effector proteins, all four isolates contain intact versions of sopb and sope. the two putative cytoplasmic proteins found in spi- <dig> of s. typhimurium lt <dig>  stm <dig> and stm <dig> and here in s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> and not d <dig> and d <dig> are unlikely candidates for effector proteins with p-values of  <dig> .

spi- <dig> distinguishes between s. derby and s. mbandaka strains. this island has also been extensively studied for a role in pathogenicity, and displays the largest amount of diversity in gene complement between s. derby and s. mbandaka. interestingly the majority of the diversity in spi gene complement between s. derby and s. mbandaka is additional genes in s. derby isolates. ni signifies a lack of information on the orf.

variation in spi- <dig> between other serovars and s. derby and s. mbandaka
spi- <dig> is highly variable, between s. typhimurium  <dig> and s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig> the only region of homology is the insertion sequence trna-selc. spi- <dig> from s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> is an amalgamation of  <dig> spi- <dig> genes from s. typhimurium  <dig>  s. dublin, s. choleroaeasuis sc-b <dig> and s. typhi ct <dig>  s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> also contain a unique spi- <dig> gene complement, containing  <dig> genes found in s. typhimurium  <dig>  s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig> and s. typhi ct <dig>  unlike s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> have no spi- <dig> genes in common with s. dublin. sty <dig> previously unique to s. typhi ct <dig> is present in s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> and absent from s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> . the main region of variation between s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> spi- <dig> is at the start of the island where the complete s. dublin spi <dig> is present, this was shown previously for s. derby  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . this region contains seven genes relating to the adhesion structures, pili and fimbriae. s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> contains rhum found in the spi- <dig> of s. typhimurium 14028; this sequence is absent from the spi- <dig> of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> share  <dig> spi- <dig> genes in common; this complement of genes is unique to these two serovars. both serovars contain five virulence genes present in the spi- <dig> of s. typhimurium  <dig> and s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig>  both serovars lack the virulence gene mgtc which is present in s. typhimurium  <dig>  s. choloraesuis sc-b <dig> and s. typhi ct <dig>  in s. typhimurium lt <dig> and  <dig> mgtc was shown to be essential for intra-macrophage survival  <cit> .

variation in spi- <dig> between other serovars and s. derby and s. mbandaka
it has previously been shown that spi- <dig> from s. derby  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and s. ohio  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> contain an additional unnamed orf, this orf was present in both s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  <cit> .

variation in spi- <dig> between s. derby and s. mbandaka
spi- <dig> is found in s. typhi ct <dig>  is  <dig> kb in length and contains  <dig> genes. between s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>   <dig> genes that were not found in other islands on pai-db were identified by glimmer <dig>   <cit> . the annotations here were taken from ncbi blastn results, many of which were hypothetical or putative in description. spi- <dig> also shows the largest variation between s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> outside of prophage and spi- <dig> nucleotide sequences. spi- <dig> in d <dig> had  <dig> unique genes at the c terminus of the positive strand that were not found in the other isolates. this contains an ap like endonuclease gene related to egg albumin resistance, yafd <cit> . s. derby has been isolated from inside of eggs while s. mbandaka has been shown to grow slower than other s. enterica serovars in albumin  <cit> . the remainder of the island showed no variation amongst isolates of the same serovar. seven s. typhi ct <dig> genes were absent from both serovars, these were sty0300-sty <dig>  sty <dig>  sty <dig> and sty <dig>  s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> spi- <dig> contained  <dig> genes from s. typhi ct <dig> that were absent from s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> spi- <dig> contained  <dig> genes from s. typhi ct <dig> that were absent from s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> 

the variation in the gene complement of spi- <dig> in s. derby and s. mbandaka is of particular interest with regards to host adaptation. s. derby possess the gene sira which corresponds with orf sty <dig> in s. typhi ct <dig>  that codes for a transcription factor linked with regulation of the ttss encoding spi- <dig> when inside a mammalian host  <cit> . interestingly mutants for sira in s. typhimurium lt <dig> were attenuated in a bovine gastro-enteritis model, but were still proficient at causing typhoid fever in a mouse model  <cit> . the spi- <dig> of s. mbandaka also contains a gene scin which is an outer membrane lipoporotein essential for biofilm formation in e. coli which is absent from s. derby  <cit> .

variation in spi- <dig> from s. typhi ct18
the alignment between spi- <dig> of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> showed 100% sequence homology. spi- <dig> from s. typhi ct <dig> contains four genes as do the islands in s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  though there is a difference in orf length. sty <dig> is at the start of the island and is  <dig>  kb in length, in both s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> an additional region of 595 bp is found between bases  <dig> and  <dig>  the other three orfs are truncated at the beginning of each sequence by 162 bp.

variation in spi- <dig> from s. derby and s. mbandaka
the same eight genes from spi- <dig> of s. choleroeaesuis sc-b <dig> are absent in s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  one of these genes is the effector protein sopb, which has been implicated in fluid secretion in calf ileal loops and is essential for enteropathogenicity of s. dublin  <cit>  although, as previously mentioned, a homolog to this gene was found elsewhere on the chromosome. spi- <dig> also encodes the gene pagc, an envelope protein which increases survival within mouse macrophage  <cit> .

variation in spi- <dig> between s. derby and s. mbandaka
spi- <dig> is an  <dig> kb island first identified in s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig>  the island is inserted at a trna-pro. the insertion sequence was present in both s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  though no genes were adjacent to this site. alignment of the whole spi- <dig> island from s. choleroeaesuis sc-b <dig> with d <dig>  d <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> identified homologs for all the genes in each sequence, not in a single unit, but spread across the chromosome.

variation in cs <dig> between s. derby and s. mbandaka
cs <dig> identified from s. typhimurium  <dig> is associated with virulence and shows variation between isolates of the same serovar. all isolates lack the virulence genes shda and ratb, and the untested gene ratc. m <dig> lacks the whole island with only the insertion sequences present . this region in d <dig>  d <dig> and m <dig> contains three genes rata, sivi and sivh previously identified in cs <dig> of s. typhimurium  <dig>  cs <dig> was previously described in s. derby strain de <dig>  in this instance ratb was also found, a gene essential for the colonisation of the cecum in balb/c mice by s. typhimurium ir <dig>  <cit> .

a novel salmonella pathogenicity island designated spi-23
a new genomic island with a putative role in pathogenesis, spi- <dig>  was discovered in this study on the chromosome of d <dig> and d <dig> between bases 2027348– <dig> and 2052685– <dig> respectively flanked by trna-asn  and a hypothetical protein, docb . spi- <dig> is composed of  <dig> orfs with an overall gc composition of 38% differing largely from the 51% of the s. derby genome. spi- <dig> is completely missing from s. mbandaka. of the  <dig> orfs  <dig> were of hypothetical status, of which,  <dig> contained no homology with an entry in the ncbi nucleotide database . the island contains two genes, potr and taln, both implicated in type iv secretion and the production of pili. there is a single gene, zomb, predicted here to encode a lipoprotein. we also find five dna binding proteins, furb, lame, half, mstr and numt and two putative membrane protein bigm and putm. spi- <dig> contains a single nudix hydrolase, a very ubiquitous protein family involved in a multitude of regulator processes  <cit> .

sieve effector protein predictor identified ten orfs  in spi- <dig> of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> with a p-value of  <dig>  or lower corresponding to a z-score of  <dig>  or higher  <cit> . docb, encoding a putative effector protein was identified by rast as a putative endoprotease and was found here to be conserved in s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  s. agona sl <dig>  s. dublin ct <dig>  s. gallinarum sgg <dig>  s. enteritidis p <dig>  s. newport sl <dig>  and s. typhimurium lt <dig>  the functional prediction of docb fits with the function of other type iii secretion effector proteins which have a cysteine protease activity  <cit> . the high number of potential type iii secretion system effector proteins makes spi- <dig> a strong candidate for classification as a pathogenicity island. the acquisition of this sequence could be responsible for the modulation of the host’s cell, cytoskeleton, immune response and intracellular signalling  <cit> . though it is not possible to determine here if spi- <dig> plays a role in defining the host range of s. derby, the high number of potential effector proteins has identified it as a very interesting region for future experimental study of host adaptation.

this table shows the comparative structure and gene content of spi- <dig> in the chromosome of different serovars. sieve z-scores above  <dig>  indicate a potential type iii effector protein. functions are taken from rast, or where no function was given, the highest hit on ncbi blastn. provisional gene names are given for orfs in spi- <dig> of s. derby; this does not conflict with existing gene names, which have been used where possible.

comparison of spi- <dig> from s. agona sl <dig>  s. dublin ct <dig> and s. gallinarum sgg <dig> with spi- <dig> found in s. derby d <dig> and d2
there were no genes between goon and docb in s. enteritidis p <dig> even though ncbi blastn showed 100% sequence homology with  <dig> genes from spi- <dig> of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  a four way comparison between spi- <dig> excised from the genomes of s. agona sl <dig>  s. dublin ct <dig>  s. gallinarum sgg <dig> and s. derby d <dig> was performed . the differences in spi- <dig> between s. agona sl <dig> and s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> are dispersed across the island in four sections . s. agona sl <dig> contains seventeen unique genes and lacks twenty two genes when compared to the spi- <dig> of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig>  all of the genes unique to s. agona sl <dig> with the exception of three are of hypothetical status, rela a gdp/gtp pyrophosphokinase, a putative component of the tonb system and a p <dig> type intergrase. spi- <dig> in s. agona sl <dig> contains only four genes that are likely candidates for type iii secretion system effector proteins . all four genes are identical in nucleotide sequence to that of s. derby d <dig>  serovars s. dublin ct <dig> and s. gallinarum sgg <dig> have identical sequences for spi- <dig>  there are fifteen genes in the spi- <dig> of these two serovars that are not found in either s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> or s. agona sl <dig> and fifteen which are found in all five serovars. only two of the hypothetical genes found in s. agona sl <dig> and not s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> are found in the spi- <dig> of s. dublin ct <dig> and s. gallinarum sgg <dig>  the spi- <dig> of s. dublin ct <dig> and s. gallinarum sgg <dig> contains four unique genes that are not of hypothetical status. this comprises two pilv-like proteins, a dna –binding protein hns and a threonine operon leader protein. both s. dublin ct <dig> and s. gallinarum sgg <dig> contain eight putative type iii secretion system effector proteins, three of these are unique genes to these two sequences and are absent from s. derby d <dig>  d <dig> and s. agona sl <dig>  two putative effector proteins are different between the spi- <dig> sequences of s. dublin ct <dig> and s. gallinarum sgg <dig>  sana is present in s. dublin ct <dig> but not identified as a putative effector protein and similarly a hypothetical gene in s. dublin ct <dig> and s. gallinarum sgg <dig>  interestingly sieve predicts the gene kayt as a type iii secretion system effector protein from the amino acid sequences of s. agona sl <dig>  s. dublin ct <dig> and s. gallinarum sgg <dig> but not that of s. derby d <dig> or d <dig>  similarly sana is identified as a candidate effector protein in all sequences with the exception of s. dublin ct <dig> 

prophage
bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, integrating into the bacterial genome in order to replicate; in this form they are known as prophage. as a result of phage insertion the genome gains a substantial amount of foreign sequence, much of which encodes phage structural proteins. however, some phage carry cargo genes which convey a pathological advantage to the recipient  <cit> . the process of lysogenic conversion prevents the prophage from destroying the host through maturation of progeny. the cargo genes and prophage remnants are therefore retained within the bacterial lineage, undergoing genetic mutation, drift and selection  <cit> .

phast identified distinct complements of intact prophage and remnant prophage regions between s. derby and s. mbandaka  <cit> . all isolates contain four phage regions, sharing only the remnants of a bcepmu phage in common. this remnant is identical in all strains, suggesting that the integration and degradation of this phage predates the split between s. derby and s. mbandaka. s. mbandaka isolates contain the same prophage regions in the same locations along the chromosome. these comprise one intact prophage, resembling phage p <dig>  two questionable prophage, similar to l413c and epsilon <dig> and one incomplete prophage bcepmu. s. derby isolates differed on the location of the prophage within the chromosome and the number of genes in all four phage regions. no ambiguous bases were identified in these regions. the partial prophage resembling sfv contains one additional orf in d <dig> than in d <dig> and occupies the same region that the complete prophage of sfv occupies in d <dig>  whereas the complete copy of sfv in d <dig> occupies the position of the complete prophage in d <dig> and contains one fewer orf. the bcepmu partial in d <dig> contains two additional orfs than that found in d <dig>  in d <dig> the intact prophage resembling st64b comprises three additional orfs than that found in d <dig>  they occupy the same chromosomal region. st64b is of particular interest as its homolog in s. typhimurium sl <dig> contains a gene with homology to a type iii secreted effector protein sske <dig>  mutants of which have shown to have reduced pathogenicity in a bovine model  <cit> . s. derby contains an intact version of in <dig>  a transposon identified from pseudomonas aeruginosa.

s. derby and s. mbandaka contain unique crispr spacer sequences
crispr operons convey an adaptive immunity against plasmids and bacteriophage to a broad range of archaeal and bacterial species. this is achieved through integration of unique regions of foreign dna into the prokaryotic chromosome. subsequent expressions of these fragments interfere with foreign nucleic acid, through complementation  <cit> . the spacer sequences within a crispr operon reflect the historical interaction between the lineage of a strain and foreign dna elements. the efficacy of invasion and ecological distribution of bacteriophage, transposons and plasmids have been found to associate with particular hosts and environments  <cit> . hence the different genomic complement of prophage and crispr operon elements in s. derby and s. mbandaka could reflect their particular niche or even define their niche within a specific group of livestock species.

s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> contain four crispr operons each, with  <dig> and  <dig> spacers respectively. s. mbandaka m <dig> contained two crispr operons with  <dig> spacers. m <dig> contains three crispr operons with  <dig> spacers. with the exception of two spacers, the sequences are completely unique to each serovar. s. derby isolates contain four crispr spacer operons, the smallest contains only one sequence with the largest containing  <dig> spacers. d <dig> contains two additional spacer sequences and half of a much larger spacer than d <dig>  s. mbandaka isolates differ on the number of spacers they each contain; m <dig> contains two operons while m <dig> contains three. the majority of spacers are homologous between the isolates, with m <dig> containing four additional spacers. m <dig> crispr operon  <dig> and  <dig> contain all of the spacer sequences in m <dig> crispr operon  <dig>  all spacer sequences can be found in the supplementary materials .

we have already shown that s. derby strains contain seven functionally unique crispr operon proteins. the lack of functional homolog in s. mbandaka, leaves it without a functioning crispr operon. crisprdb shows here that s. mbandaka strains contain arrays of crispr spacer sequences; these may be remnant from when s. mbandaka had a fully functioning crispr operon. s. mbandaka may now be susceptible to those phage and plasmid for which it once had resistance; this could reflect the loss of positive selection pressure on the operon from the surrounding environment.

estimating the time since the divergence of s. derby and s. mbandaka
whole genome alignment and snp calling across cds nucleotide sequences was used to estimate the years since divergence of d <dig>  d <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  interestingly the time since the divergence of s. derby and s. mbandaka is estimated at between  <dig>  and  <dig>  years, based on an average of the ks values for all four pair-wise comparisons of s. derby and s. mbandaka isolates ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the divergence of s. derby and s. mbandaka coincides with the estimated time of the divergence of all domesticated pig species, approximately  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . the time since the split between d <dig> and d <dig> was estimated at between  <dig> and 1200 years ago based on  <dig> synonymous snps spread across  <dig> synonymous positions. the isolates m <dig> and m <dig> are estimated to have diverged between  <dig> to 4357 years ago based on  <dig> synonymous snps spread across  <dig> synonymous positions.

CONCLUSIONS
we estimate here that s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> diverged from s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig> between 182kya and 625kya, during this period these serovars appear to have adapted towards two distinct ranges of host species. comparative functional genomics has alluded to several mechanisms that could contribute towards distinct host adaptations of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  most noteworthy of these differences are the diversity in spi- <dig> gene complement and the discovery in the chromosome sequence of s. derby, of a new  <dig> kb genomic island, spi- <dig> encoding  <dig> orfs, ten of which are putative ttss effector proteins. the absence of functional homologs to several crispr operon genes in the chromosome sequences of s. mbandaka may reduce the fitness of the serovar in environments laden with actively integrative foreign genetic elements. the increased gene dosage of the csg-biofilm operon and the ycd-swarming operon in s. mbandaka could make the implementation of these two behaviours more readily achievable. both of these behaviours are considered stress responses. s. mbandaka also possesses an operon pertaining to the uptake and metabolism of d-galactonate into glycolysis which is absent from the chromosome of s. derby.

the genetic background in which the function of the genes discussed here have been characterised is non-isogenic to the chromosome of s. derby d <dig> and d <dig> and s. mbandaka m <dig> and m <dig>  due to the different context these genes are found in, firm conclusions on the function of these genes in these specific serovars can only be formed through further biological experimentation.
