BACKGROUND
archeological, anatomical, linguistic, and genetic evidence have collectively shown that the original human inhabitants of the western hemisphere most likely arrived from asia across an exposed land mass between northeastern siberia and alaska, referred to as beringia, during the last glacial maximum  approximately  <dig> to  <dig> thousand years ago   <cit> . however, despite the general consensus of an asian origin for native americans, a number of uncertainties persist regarding the dynamic nature of the peopling of the americas, including the ancestral source population within asia, the arrival time of the founder groups, the number of expansion events, and the specific migration routes into the new world  <cit> .

mitochondrial dna  data presented over the past two decades have shown that native american populations exhibit, almost exclusively, five mtdna haplogroups   <cit>  classified in the autochthonous american lineages a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig>  and x2a  <cit> . haplogroups a - d are found throughout the new world and are frequent in asia, supporting a northeastern asian origin of these lineages  <cit> . the pan-american distribution of haplogroups a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig> and d <dig>  along with their similar levels of diversity and estimates for coalescence time, has been used to support a single-migration model  <cit> . nested within this model, the beringian land mass has been suggested to play an important role as a region where ancestral populations crossed and perhaps settled prior to their eventual expansion into the americas, leading to the diversification of the new world founding lineages  <cit> . the evolutionary history of the fifth founder lineage, x2a, remains elusive and highly debated, with some scholars arguing for an additional migration event into the new world to account for the x lineage, one that was independent from the founder populations responsible for introducing the pan-american haplogroups  <cit> .

the "beringian incubation model"   <cit>  and its variants  <cit>  emphasize that the native american founder population reached greater beringia by  <dig> kya, marked by the earliest evidence of human habitation in northeastern siberia yana rhinoceros horn site  <cit> . according to these models, the founder populations remained in beringian lgm refugium for about 5- <dig> kya, ecologically isolated to the west and physically isolated to the east by the glaciers that are believed to have effectively blocked the way to america until near the end of the lgm  <cit> . during this time, mtdna lineages of american founders are likely to have differentiated from their asian precursors. as the laurentide and cordilleran ice sheets retreated, the paused populations rapidly colonized the double continent around 14- <dig> kya, resulting in largely autochthonous patterns of variation within the continental founder haplogroups  <cit> .

however, the timing of this peopling scenario has been questioned due to the existence of pre-clovis archaeological sites, such as the monte verde site in southern south america that dates human habitation by at least  <dig>  kya  <cit> , as well as demographic models based on mtdna variation that indicate pronounced growth of native american founder populations starting at ~ <dig> to <dig> kya  <cit> , thus marking the effective colonization of the new world prior to the opening of the ice free corridors in north america. to accommodate these dates, an alternate early coastal route has been suggested for the initial colonization of the americas, which would have been largely ice free at ~ <dig> kya  <cit> .

in northeastern siberia, the putative origin of the native american founder populations, there is archaeological evidence for human presence as early as  <dig> kya  <cit> . the estimated dates of the beringian 'pause',   <cit>  and its potential role as a time when american founders diverged from their siberian-asian/asian ancestors represent interesting avenues for microevolutionary reconstruction. furthermore, the proposition for a beringian pause  <cit>  is largely based on the assumption that the american founder haplogroups differentiated during the beringian pause/isolation. several related issues remain to be addressed. first, despite the fact that much of interior beringia remains in contemporary alaska and northeast siberia, no archaeological evidence of this population in residence has been found  <cit> . second, a resident, presumably stable and possibly growing, population in beringia seems an unlikely candidate for reduced genetic diversity in american founders as a result of founder effect. third, while chukchi and siberian eskimos share mtdna lineages with alaskan eskimos, aleuts and other native north americans  <cit> , this sharing falls almost exclusively under haplogroups a <dig> and d <dig>  the restricted genetic variation observed among these populations  seems inconsistent as a source area for the more extensive genetic variation observed in the rest of the americas. furthermore, the presence of haplogroup d <dig> in the beringians is attributed to a second expansion from southern siberia  <cit>  and a <dig> is limited in diversity in beringia  <cit> .

in this study, we analyzed  <dig> mitochondrial genomes  belonging to four pan-native american  lineages and a2a, a2b, a4b, c1a, c <dig> and d4e <dig> sister clades from siberia-asia, to better understand the underlying processes of the diversification of the native american founders from their asian counterparts and their expansion into the new world.

RESULTS
maternal legacy of mexican americans
mexicans are, by and large, descendants of native american and european  ancestors  <cit> . historical accounts also document african slavery in mexico during the 16th-18th centuries  <cit> , another source of admixture in the mexican population. the admixture estimates compiled by lisker et al.  <cit>  using data derived from classical genetic systems reported in previous studies in mexico  <cit>  identified african and/or european genetic variation in all mexican regions and groups analyzed. for mtdna variation, some studies have measured native american, european and african contributions to mexican and mexican american populations, revealing  <dig> to 90% of mtdna lineages are of native american origin  <cit> , with the remainder having european  or african ancestry   <cit> . thus the observed frequency of native american mtdna in mexican/mexican americans is higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of native american admixture for these populations i.e. ~ 30-46%  <cit> . the difference is indicative of directional mating involving preferentially immigrant men and native american women. this type of genetic asymmetry has been observed in other populations, including brazilian individuals of african ancestry, as the analysis of sex specific and autosomal markers has revealed evidence for substantial european admixture that was mediated mostly through men  <cit> . in our  <dig> completely sequenced mexican american mitochondrial genomes,  <dig>  are of african ancestry belonging to haplogroups l0a1a'3', l2a <dig>  l3b, l3d and u6a7;  <dig>  belong to european haplogroups hv, jt, u <dig>  u <dig>  u5; and k and the majority  are of native american ancestry, which is very similar to previous reports  <cit> .

after removing the related individuals from our maternal lines and those of european or african descent,  <dig> newly sequenced unrelated mtdna genomes of native american ancestry were identified for founder haplogroups a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig> and d4e1c . these complete mtdna sequences were analyzed together with  <dig> previously published sequences belonging to the four primary native american founder haplogroups a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig> and d <dig> and their asian sister clades .

haplogroup 'a2' and its sister clades
a total of  <dig> american sequences  belonging to pan-american haplogroup a <dig>  form  <dig> distinct haplotypes, one nested within the beringian subtype a2a and the other  <dig> largely autochthonous to geographical north, central and south america, except central american which shares a few branches with both north and south americans.  <dig> of these  <dig> haplotypes were previously labeled a2c through a2q  <cit> . however, based on our phylogenetic reconstruction of the haplotypes, we changed the previously reported definitions of a2e, a2f and a2n. clade a2e is now defined by only one substitution at , a2f sequences share a back mutation at np  <dig>  and a2n has a back mutation at  <dig> , although it should be noted that the control region mutations are recurrent. the other new haplotypes with three or more sequences have been labeled a2r through a2w.

of the two beringian specific branches , a2a is the only sublineage shared by the chukchi, siberian and north american eskimos, aleuts, and na-dene populations. the a2a and a2b sublineages might have diverged from the rest of the american subtypes sometime between  <dig> to  <dig> kya, as suggested by the founder coalescent ages of a2a and a2b and the coalescent age of haplogroup a <dig> calculated using the mutation rates of mishmar et al.  <cit>  and soares et al.  <cit> . the coalescent age of haplogroup a <dig> calculated using these two mutation rates over america specific lineages  indicates its early expansion into america. the haplogroup a <dig> shares the root a <dig> with the siberia-asia specific sister clades a4a, a4b and a4c. the coalescent age estimate of a <dig>  as per mutation rates of mishmar et al.  <cit>  and soares et al.  <cit> , are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya respectively.

haplogroup 'b2'
the phylogeny of haplogroup b <dig> reveals a total of  <dig> haplotypes, with  <dig> previously defined subhaplogroups named b2a through b2i  <cit> , and two new lineages, b2j and b2k, defined here by control region substitutions at  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the remaining haplotypes were not classified because they consist of only two or fewer representative sequences. similar to the other pan american haplogroups, sublineages within the b <dig> haplogroup are specific to geographical regions . only a few branches harbor sequences across geographical regions. the sub branch b2b by virtue of its early differentiation  encompasses the north, central and south america. the coalescent age estimates of b <dig> calculated as per  <cit>  and  <cit>  mutation rates are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya respectively. the haplogroup b <dig> lacks any known immediate sister/ancestral clades in siberia other then the b4b <dig> in south east asia.

haplogroup 'c1' and 'c4'
the c root is represented by two lineages in america: the pan american haplogroup c1; and the recently identified subhaplogroup 'c4c', found in only two sequences, an ijka sample from south america  <cit>  and a shuswap speaker from north america  <cit> . the c4c subhaplogroup shares root c <dig> with two wide spread lineages in siberia-asia, subhaplogroup c4a  and c4b . the coalescence age estimates of the c4c  are based on only two known sequences and are therefore not very reliable; coalescent age of root c <dig>  suggest its early differentiation.

in the case of the more abundant and widely distributed haplogroup c <dig>  three basal branches are ubiquitous in the americas , and spread across the three major geographic regions. the fourth branch, c1a, is found in siberian and east asian populations. the c1c branch exhibits an older coalescent age of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya/ <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya , harboring sublineages  that are spread across the three major geographical regions. the coalescent age of c1b is estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> kya/ <dig>  ±  <dig> kya  and for c1d, it is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya/ <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya . the estimated coalescent age of siberian branch c1a is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya/ <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya  which is considerably younger. however its founder age is estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya/ <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya which is comparable to the american branches . the estimated coalescent ages of the roots for c <dig>  and c <dig>  calculated as per mutation rates of mishmar et al.  <cit>  and soares et al.  <cit> , along with their subclades c4a and c1c, respectively, indicate that these native american clusters diverged from siberian-asian sister clades sometime during the lgm peak.

haplogroup 'd1', 'd4e'and 'd4h'
the phylogenetic reconstruction of  <dig> new and  <dig> published mitochondrial genomes from america and siberia-asia reveals that haplogroup 'd' is represented by at least three branches in america. the d <dig> haplogroup is found in high frequency throughout the americas. d4h3a is rare but also widely distributed. we identified two mexican american sequences belonging to a new sub branch named d4e1c, defined by the substitutions  <dig> and  <dig>  this new branch has been defined in our tree based on the only two sequences, but an exception was made due to its phylogenetic importance. the d4e1c shares the root d4e <dig>  with d <dig>  which is a diverse lineage found from southern siberia to beringia  <cit>  and d4e1a found in japan  <cit> . since d4e1c has only two known sequences, coalescent age estimates are not reliable. however coalescent age estimates of d4e <dig>  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya/ <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya  suggests early divergence of d4e1c from its sister clades siberian/beringian d <dig> and japanese d4e1a. the phylogeny of d <dig> reveals  <dig> haplotypes, all more or less autochthonous to respective geographical regions except sub branch d1f which harbors genomes from north, central and south america. based on its phylogeography and coalescent age , d1f appears to have differentiated early. the overall coalescent age of d <dig> haplogroup is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya/ <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya .

we did not find sequences belonging to rare haplogroup x2a in our sample, whereas the other rare haplogroup d4h <dig> is represented by only one sequence. a recent study  <cit> , based on  <dig> x2a and  <dig> d4h <dig> complete mtdna sequences concluded that although the coding region divergence of these haplogroups shows considerable overlap, their phylogeography in america is strikingly different. the haplogroup d4h <dig> is found along the pacific coast; whereas x2a is restricted to northern north america and hence envisaged two different paths of arrival. the haplogroup d4h <dig> followed the pacific coastal path just like other pan american haplogroups, whereas x2a might have arrived from beringia through a path represented by the ice free corridor between the laurentide and cordilleran ice sheets  <cit> . we concentrated our further analysis on a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  c4c, d4e1c and d <dig> american haplogroups and their siberian/asian sister clades.

diversity indices and neutrality tests
since we were interested in detecting the genetic consequences of demographic events that occurred during and after the peopling of the double continent, we computed nucleotide diversity and different estimators of the parameter θ =  <dig> neμ to compare the amount of within population variability in beringia, north america, central america and south america. also, in order to investigate the possibility of later expansions/migrations of native american populations as suggested previously  <cit> , we also performed the analysis by categorizing the native american samples with respect to the four pan american haplogroups in the respective geographic regions.

the similar estimates of nucleotide diversity and θπ in north america , central america  and south america  and the significantly negative value of tajima's d and fu's fs  suggest almost simultaneous  colonization of the three geographical regions, with rapid population expansion differentiating into more or less regional branches across the haplogroups . however the comparatively higher value of θk  and significantly negative fu's fs  in north and central america, respectively, may also suggest an excess of rare alleles/haplotypes. the value of θk  in south america is comparatively low when compared to north and central america.

sd: standard deviation

the low values of diversity indices  and non-significantly negative values of both neutrality tests  in beringia suggest very different demographic patterns to that of native americans. the analysis of within haplogroups diversity in the respective geographic region , though not significantly different when considered with standard deviation, shows two contrasting patterns of distribution i.e. nucleotide diversity and θπ levels for a <dig> and b <dig> haplogroups that are highest in north america, followed by south america and the lowest observed for central america. in contrast, haplogroups c <dig> and d <dig> show a cline from south america to north america. as evident in the few shared branches across geographical region , the recent gene flow from the north and south might have resulted in the low diversity indices and higher values of θk in the central american populations. the high values of diversity indices  along with high θk  and highly significant negative fu's fs  of haplogroup a <dig> in north america may indicate a secondary expansion of the a <dig> haplogroup following the path represented by the ice free corridor between the laurentide and cordilleran ice sheets. a similar path for the expansion of haplogroup x2a in america has been suggested previously  <cit> .

bayesian skyline plot analysis
the above results suggest a complex demographic history associated with the colonization of the three geographic regions and of the americas as a whole. we used bayesian skyline plot analysis  <cit>  to visually illustrate the change in effective population size in beringia and three geographical regions of america. in this analysis, neτ  is unaffected by the different proposals for the actual number of founder lineages among present day populations  <cit> . the bayesian skyline plots presented in figure  <dig>  show that beringian populations  suffered a gradual population decline following their divergence from native americans and siberian ancestors  and are establishing moderate growth ~ <dig>  kya. in contrast, a pronounced population growth starting ~ <dig> kya  in south america and ~ <dig> kya  in north and central america, continuing up ~16- <dig> kya in south and central america and a little prolonged ~14- <dig> kya in north america has been observed. as reported earlier  <cit> , each region in our analysis identifies a moderate population bottle neck just before the manifold rapid growth, which probably suggests a time frame of native american founder's divergence and differentiation from their asian ancestors sometime around lgm and then rapid expansion into america.

discussion
our analysis of a large data set of  <dig> mitochondrial genomes  from north, central and south america, as well as beringia and siberia-asia shows that the coalescent age estimates of shared roots calculated as per the mutation rates of mishmar et al.  <cit>  and soares et al.  <cit>  between siberian-asian and native american lineages i.e. a <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , and d4e <dig>  average around lgm when considered together with their standard deviations . these coalescent estimates along with the phylogeography of pan american haplogroups and siberian-asian sister clades strongly suggest that american founders diverged from their siberian-asian progenitors sometime during lgm. it is most likely that the hostile conditions during the lgm   <cit> , caused by extensive glaciations, with a large ice lobe extending eastwards across northern siberia  <cit>  might have forced some populations back into southern siberian lgm refuge, plausibly in altai-sayan and/or mid-lower amur region  <cit>  and the american founders to the east into beringia. a swift expansion further south into the american continent occurred right after the lgm  <cit> , most plausibly around 20- <dig> kya , as suggested by the coalescent age estimates of pan american haplogroups  calculated as per the mutation rates of mishmar et al.  <cit>  and soares et al.  <cit>  and estimates of populations expansions using bayesian skyline approach . the estimated average time difference between the divergence of native americans from their siberian-asian precursors and the expansion of founding population into america is less than  <dig>  ky irrespective of the mutation rate used . the hostile conditions during lgm are also evident in the compilation of the records of fossil woody material or other plant macrofossils across northern siberia i.e. records become progressively rarer right after  <dig> kya and then are absent completely for several thousand years in the period that includes the lgm  <cit> . given that the opening of the ice free corridor is dated not earlier than ~ <dig> kya, a coastal  route would have been the only option for initial expansion  <cit> . our data also show that the expansion of pan american haplogroups within the double continent is far more complex, contrary to the uniformity assumed by the bim models and its variants  <cit> . the earliest expansion observed in the population reaching south america support the pre-clovis occupation of the new world via the coastal route right after lgm. the expansion in north america occurred after the lgm  indicating a still prevailing lgm condition in the north. these expansions, separated by time and space and perhaps involving pan american lineages differentially, are responsible for a complex pattern of mtdna diversity within the haplogroups a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  and d <dig> in the three geographical regions of america. some intra-haplogroup variation, at least differentiation of sub branches b2b, c1b, c1c, c1d and d1f, already existed in american founders before expansion into the americas. the population bottleneck, also reported previously  <cit> , though moderate during this period  and a many fold rapid expansion right after lgm  perhaps better explains the few founder types in america.

the phylogeography and diversity within haplogroup c <dig> shows a cline south to north in america. however c <dig> is subdivided in the three pan american braches   <cit>  and a siberian-asian representative c1a  <cit> . the subhaplogroup c1a, which shares root substitutions with american sub branches , is found in japan  <cit>  and southern siberia  <cit> . finding c1a in america or beringia could help to explain the presence of c1a in siberia-asia as a result of a back migration from beringia or america, a scenario enforced in bim by tamm et al.  <cit>  to explain origin of haplogroup c <dig> in beringia and its phylogeography. yet, to date this has not been achieved even after large sampling from this area  <cit> . therefore, one still cannot rule out the most parsimonious scenario that haplogroup c <dig> originated in siberia-asia  <cit> . it is also worth noting that even though c1a is found across diverse populations in siberia-asia, it is rare; whereas c <dig>  which differentiated into c1b, c1c and c1d, is found in high frequency in america, and its phylogeography and coalescent age in america is very similar to the other pan american haplogroups   <cit> . therefore disappearing c1a from the expanding population in america appears unlikely given that it would require disappearance of a lineage from an expanding population in an unpopulated territory, a demographic situation in which loss of lineage due to genetic drift is minimized  <cit> . furthermore back migration of only c1a from beringia to siberia-asia as suggested in bim by tamm et al.  <cit> , when all the pan american haplogroup existed in a stable, plausibly expanding population in beringia seems less parsimonious.

in addition to c <dig>  another founder lineage 'c4c' has been defined recently in native americans  <cit> , which shares root 'c4' with the diverse siberian-asian sister clades c4a and c4b. the coalescent age estimates of c <dig>  and c <dig>  calculated as per  <cit>  and  <cit>  further support a recent divergence of american founders from their siberian-asian progenitors.

the haplogroup a <dig> coalescent age , phylogeography and diversity distribution in america and beringia, has been used to suggest its in-situ origin in american founders plausibly in the beringian-alaskan region  <cit> . however this diversity is restricted to only two branches  in beringia. therefore differentiation of its precursor in siberia-asia or soon after the divergence of native american founders from their siberian-asian precursor cannot be ruled out. the time window for such differentiation would have been any time between the age of its shared root a <dig>  with siberian-asian sister clades  and its own american coalescent age , or more plausibly ~21- <dig> kya marked by the first expansion of modern human into america  <cit> . the diversity distribution along with demographic parameter also indicates that there could be more than one expansion of a <dig> in north america plausibly following two different paths, one pacific coastal path just like the other pan american haplogroups and another path represented by the ice free corridor between the laurentide and cordilleran ice sheets, similar to x2a  <cit> . the environmental and paleoecological data, indicates that such a path existed and was represented by the ice-free corridor between the laurentide and cordilleran ice sheets, which opened approximately  <dig> kya  <cit>  or possibly was never completely closed  <cit> . through such a corridor, small glacial-refuge areas have been recently identified  <cit> .

the phylogeography and within haplogroup diversity of haplogroup b <dig> is very similar to haplogroup a <dig> and supports a major expansion from north america to south america. so far haplogroup b <dig> lacks any known immediate sister/ancestral clades in siberia other then the b4b <dig> in south east asia, and it remains unclear whether the b <dig>  dating to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya/ <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya, has evolved in situ in american founders after their divergence from siberian-asian ancestors or siberia-asia itself.

the d <dig> clusters coalescent age , represents the divergence age of its sub branches, d <dig> found only in america and d4e <dig> and d4h <dig> having distributed from asia to america, suggest a more complex process of differentiation. the within haplogroup diversity of haplogroup d <dig> showing a cline south to north in america and having at least one sub branch 'd1f', already differentiated before the expansion and numerous later regional sub branches strongly suggest its early differentiation and a sizable population with basal d <dig> prior to expansion into america. contrary to the absence of any known progenitor in siberia-asia, a siberian-asian origin of d <dig> cannot be ruled out  <cit> . the d4e <dig> is represented by japanese branch d4e1a in asia  <cit> , d <dig> in siberia/beringia and by our newly discovered d4e1c branch in america. d <dig> constitutes two different clusters with contrasting geographic distribution. the cluster d2a is found in high frequency among chukchi, aleuts, and eskimos  <cit> , whereas the second cluster d2b is reported in buryat, khamnigan and yakut populations  <cit> . the phylogeography of d <dig> and the coalescent age estimate  may suggest its southern siberian origin and later expansion to beringia. but american clade d4e1c, though rare, known by only two sequences from our current work, diverge from the root d4e <dig> and the coalescent age of d4e <dig> , strongly suggest that d4e1c was the part of initial colonization of americas.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of a data set of  <dig> mitochondrial genomes from north, central and south america, as well as beringia and siberia-asia suggest that american founders diverged from their siberian-asian progenitors sometime during lgm and expanded into america soon after the lgm peak . further, time between the native american divergence from siberian-asians to the expansion into america was shorter than the previous estimates. the phylogeography of haplogroup c <dig> suggest that this american founder haplogroup differentiated in siberia-asia. although it is not clear for the haplogroup b <dig>  haplogroups a <dig> and d <dig> might have differentiated soon after the native american founder's divergence. a moderate population bottle neck in american founder populations just before the expansion  most plausibly resulted in few founder types in america. the similar estimates of the diversity indices and bayesian skyline analysis in north america, central america and south america suggest almost simultaneous  colonization of these geographical regions with rapid population expansion differentiating into more or less regional branches across the pan american haplogroups a <dig>  b <dig>  d <dig> and the c1b, c1c, c1d subhaplogroups of c <dig>  however, some sub branches  already existed in american founder haplogroups before expansion into the americas.
