BACKGROUND
peroxisome proliferators, which include insecticides, herbicides, surfactants, phthalates, organic solvents, and hypolipidemic/anti-inflammatory fibrate drugs, were discovered as chemicals that upon administration to rodents increase the number of liver peroxisomes, stimulate fatty acid catabolism, and after chronic exposure cause hepatomegaly and hepatocarcinogenesis  <cit> . the effects of peroxisome proliferators are mediated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α   <cit> . pparα, together with pparδ and pparγ, forms a small subfamily of ppars within the superfamily of nuclear receptors  <cit> . similarly to other nuclear receptors, pparα acts as a heterodimer with the retinoid x receptor and occupies specific dna sequences referred to as ppar response elements. binding of a ligand to pparα leads to the dissociation of co-repressors and the association of co-activators necessary for the activation of transcription. in mice, pparα has the highest expression level in liver and brown adipose tissue, followed by a lower expression in kidney, heart, and intestine  <cit> . the physiological role of pparα in liver is to govern lipid metabolism. in particular during starvation, activation of pparα leads to stimulation of fatty acid  uptake, mitochondrial β-oxidation, peroxisomal fa oxidation, and ketogenesis  <cit> . in addition, pparα controls lipoprotein metabolism . due to the role of pparα in maintenance of lipid homeostasis, it has become an important molecular target for dyslipidemia  <cit> . in addition, pparα ligands and dual pparα/pparδ ligands are being explored for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  <cit> .

apart from its profound role in regulation of lipid metabolism, pparα exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects, which may be beneficial in the treatment of several metabolic diseases associated with inflammation such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis  <cit> . the anti-inflammatory actions of pparα are mediated via its negative interference with other nuclear factors such as the nf-κb, ap- <dig>  c/ebp, and stat proteins, which govern innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . in the liver, hepatocytes likely are the major cell type mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of pparα, since no pparα was detected in rat liver resident macrophages i.e. kupffer cells  <cit> . in addition to hepatocytes, pparα is expressed in other relevant immune cells such as dendritic cells, non-hepatic macrophages, as well as b and t lymphocytes, which can infiltrate the liver during development of metabolic disorders. accordingly, these cells are potential therapeutic targets for pparα ligands to manage hepatic inflammation . pparα is also expressed in non-hepatic vascular cells, likely accounting for the effects of synthetic pparα agonists on angiogenesis  <cit> , endothelial permeability  <cit> , and vascular adhesion capacity  <cit> , which are important in the treatment of atherosclerosis. however, it is questionable whether pparα agonists can directly affect hepatic endothelial cell gene expression, because mouse and rat endothelial cells do not express pparα  <cit> .

although pparα is expressed in the liver parenchymal fraction  and is not or very weakly expressed in the rodent non-parenchymal liver fraction   <cit> , it is presumed that interactions between both fractions as well as inter-organ interactions are necessary to fulfill hepatic pparα functions related to regulation of lipid metabolism and immunity. in order to determine how cellular composition and inter-organ interactions influence gene expression upon pparα activation, we performed a meta-analysis of transcriptomics data obtained from relevant mouse liver models represented by mouse primary hepatocytes  treated with the pparα agonist wy <dig> for  <dig> or  <dig> h , precision cut liver slices  treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> h , and livers of wild type  and ppara knockout  mice treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> h or  <dig> days . the aim was to obtain a comprehensive view of common and model-specific pparα-dependent genes and biological processes to understand the impact of the cross-talk between parenchymal and non-parenchymal fractions as well as the effect of inter-organ interactions on the hepatic pparα transcriptome. in addition, we aimed to assess the performance of in vitro and ex vivo liver models to study the pparα transcriptome in relation to the in vivo situation.

RESULTS
identification of differentially expressed genes
in order to identify genes significantly altered by pharmacological pparα activation, we analyzed microarray data of different liver models  treated with the synthetic pparα agonist wy <dig> using rank products   <cit> . the use of wy <dig> was justified by the observation that changes in in vivo hepatic gene expression elicited by wy <dig> and another common pparα agonist fenofibrate were extremely similar . only genes that were overlapping between different types of microarray chips used in our study were included in the analysis. in general it was observed that the number of significantly altered genes increased with increasing complexity of the liver model  . thus, in primary hepatocytes treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> h and  <dig> h,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were upregulated, respectively. in liver slices,  <dig> genes were significantly upregulated by wy <dig>  and in livers of mice exposed to wy <dig> for  <dig> h and  <dig> days,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were significantly upregulated, respectively. very few genes were downregulated by pparα activation in primary hepatocytes, whereas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were significantly downregulated by wy <dig> treatment in liver slices, mouse livers treated for  <dig> h, and mouse livers treated for  <dig> days, respectively.figure  <dig>

relevance of in vitroand ex vivomodels for the in vivosituation
to determine the resemblance between “simpler” liver models  vs. the more complex models , venn diagram analysis of genes significantly regulated in each model was performed. the analysis showed that there was a substantial overlap between the “simpler” hepatic models and the in vivo models, figure 2a-c.figure  <dig>

additionally, to evaluate whether wy <dig> affected gene expression in the same direction in in vitro/ex vivo versus in vivo models, and to compare the magnitude of fold changes in each model, pearson’s correlation analysis was performed . in the analysis we separately compared expression changes of genes significantly upregulated  in primary hepatocytes and liver slices after wy <dig> treatment with expression changes of the corresponding genes in vivo. interestingly, we observed that the majority of the genes analyzed were commonly upregulated between in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo experiments. the magnitude of gene expression changes was generally higher in vivo compared to in vitro and ex vivo .figure  <dig>

the same type of analysis was performed for the significantly downregulated genes  identified ex vivo, i.e. expression of genes significantly downregulated in liver slices was compared with expression changes of the corresponding genes in vivo. surprisingly, out of  <dig> significantly downregulated genes in liver slices, only  <dig> and  <dig> corresponding genes were changed in the same direction in livers of mice treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> h and  <dig> days, respectively, while the remaining genes were unaltered or upregulated in vivo compared to ex vivo. in general, fold changes of the commonly downregulated genes were lower in liver slices compared to livers in vivo . due to the absence of significantly downregulated genes in primary hepatocytes, no correlation analysis was performed for this model.

gene ontology analysis
in order to obtain a comprehensive view of the biological processes affected by wy <dig> in different liver models, significantly up- and down-regulated genes were subjected to go analysis using david  <cit> . the go analysis of the upregulated genes by wy <dig> in all liver models revealed that several go terms related to different aspects of lipid catabolism such as “fatty acid metabolic process” and “acyl-coa metabolic process” were significantly enriched in almost all hepatic models, except for “lipid localization” and “peroxisomes organization”, which were found only in vivo . however, go terms related to cell proliferation/tumorgenesis and other aspects of lipid metabolism were significantly enriched only in livers of mice exposed to wy <dig> for  <dig> days .figure  <dig>

the go analysis performed for the significantly downregulated genes showed that go terms related to different aspects of immunity were significantly enriched in both ex vivo and in vivo models . go terms exclusively detected in livers of mice exposed to wy <dig> for  <dig> days were related to immunity, coagulation, protein/amino acid metabolism, metabolism of organic compounds as well as go processes nominated as “oxidation reduction”. “steroid metabolic process”, “hemostasis”, “regulation of body fluid levels”, “bile acid metabolic process”, “lipid localization”, and “lipid transport” .figure  <dig>

“pparα-tailored analysis”
due to the fact that the go analysis resulted in functional annotation of only a sub-fraction of the total number of significant genes , an additional functional analysis, referred to as “pparα-tailored analysis”, was performed. the incentive for this additional analysis was to annotate a higher number of genes than via go analysis and assign genes to novel and more detailed functional categories. the “pparα-tailored analysis” was performed gene by gene using the open access database genecards. genecards provides current genomic, proteomic, genetic, transcriptomic, and functional information on all known and predicted genes. the selection of genes for the “pparα-tailored analysis” was rather subjective; we considered all significant genes that were overlapping between at least two hepatic models . eventually we considered  <dig> unique upregulated genes  and  <dig> unique downregulated genes . the aim behind such a selection was to focus on the most relevant genes for pparα signaling across all liver models and at the same time reduce the total number of genes analyzed. we only analyzed genes that are regulated in a pparα-dependent manner. thus genes that were significantly regulated by wy <dig> treatment in both wildtype and ppara-ko were excluded from the “pparα-tailored analysis”. using genecards we were able to functionally annotate  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, which were divided into up- and down-regulated functional categories . as part of the “pparα-tailored analysis”, genes related to lipid catabolism were categorized into “peroxisomal β-oxidation”, “peroxisomal membrane & biogenesis”, and “mitochondrial carriers” and these categories, similarly to the results from go analysis, contained significantly upregulated genes in all liver models . however, the more complex the hepatic model, the higher the number of significant genes and their fold change. as in go analysis, a gene functional category related to tumorgenesis  contained genes that were significantly upregulated only in in vivo models .figure  <dig> 
gene selection for the “pparα tailored analysis”. genes selected for the “pparα tailored analysis” consisted of significantly up- and down-regulated genes  that were overlapping between at least two liver models. numbers of overlapping up- and down-regulated genes are presented in a and b respectively. ph  <dig> h/ <dig> h stands for primary hepatocytes treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> or  <dig> h, pcls  <dig> h-precision cut liver slices treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> h, and l <dig> h/5d-liver treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> h of  <dig> days.



in comparison to go analysis, the “pparα-tailored analysis” led to the identification of additional upregulated functional categories such as “extracellular matrix” , “cytoskeleton”, “endothelial functions”, “integrity of golgi”, “vesicular trafficking”, “endocytosis”, and “neurotransmission”. genes belonging to these categories were significantly upregulated almost exclusively in vivo . downregulated functional categories such as “acute phase” or “coagulation” contained genes that were significantly downregulated mostly in vivo; only few genes within these categories were also significantly downregulated in liver slices  . in addition, compared to go analysis, the “pparα-tailored analysis” identified novel downregulated gene functional categories such as “transcriptional co-repression/activation”, “nf-κb ”, “immunity”, “t and b cells functions”, “angiogenesis”, “ecm”, “cytoskeleton”, and “neurotransmission”. genes belonging to these categories were significantly and nearly exclusively downregulated in vivo, with the exception of a few genes that were also significantly downregulated ex vivo and none of these genes were significantly altered in vitro .

in general, the results of the “pparα-tailored analysis” were in line with the statistical and go analyses and revealed that the most significant changes occurred in vivo, followed by ex vivo, and the least changes occurred in in vitro models. however, compared to go analysis, the “pparα-tailored analysis” annotated a higher percentage of the analyzed genes  as well as identified additional and novel pparα-related functional categories. a summary of the results of the ‘pparα- tailored analysis’ is presented in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
summary of the “pparα tailored analysis”. genes selected for the “pparα-tailored analysis” were annotated using genecards and grouped into functional categories such as “peroxisomes”, “mitochondria” etc. the total number of significantly up- and down-regulated genes found per category in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models is represented by horizontal bars. bars located > <dig> on y axis show number of upregulated genes and bars located < <dig> on y axis show number of downregulated genes. in vitro represents primary hepatocytes treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> h, ex vivo - precision cut liver slices treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> h and in vivo - livers of mice treated with wy <dig> for  <dig> days.



integrated concept of pparα signaling during its pharmacological activation
biological processes identified in the meta-analysis were integrated into a simplified concept of hepatic pparα signaling under not-inflamed conditions . we propose that during activation of pparα, significant regulation of genes related to “ecm” and “cytoskeleton” as well as “endothelial functions”, “endocytosis”, “golgi”, and “vesicular trafficking” might facilitate sudden influx and traffic of fa to hepatocytes and target organelles such as nucleus, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. at the same time, activation of pparα leads to immunosuppression caused by downregulation of genes related to “nf-κb signaling”, “coagulation”, “acute phase”, and “immunity”, likely to suppress an immune response elicited by massive traffic of potentially cytotoxic fa  <cit> . finally, pharmacological activation of pparα affects genes involved in “neurotransmission”.figure  <dig>

discussion
the challenge in meta-analyses is to circumvent the variation of independent microarray experiments and extract biologically relevant information  <cit> . the meta-analysis of hepatic pparα signaling performed in our study is mostly based on separate microarray experiments that were generated over several years and originally served a different purpose than this study  <cit> . variations in the experimental set up used to generate these microarray data are: use of different types of affymetrix gene chips, different batches of chemicals, unequal number of biological replicates per group, differences in time of exposure to wy <dig> and model-specific concentration of wy <dig>  furthermore, there were differences related to age, gender, and mouse strains, which all together could increase experimental variation and hamper the identification of genuine biological effects. however, the experiments were performed on the same platform, by the same technician, and standard procedures were used over the years.

to minimize the effects of the above-mentioned experimental differences, and to allow identification of biologically relevant significant genes, we applied the rp approach. the rp approach is a powerful statistical method to analyze microarray data generated from relatively few replicates, performed in different laboratories and/or using different platforms. moreover, rp outperformed other statistical tests applied in meta-analyses such as t-based approach and fisher’s inverse χ <dig> method  <cit> .

in our study, we identified a variable number of significantly up- and down-regulated genes in different liver models. the number of significantly regulated genes corresponded with the complexity of the hepatic model determined by time of exposure, cellular composition, and the absence/presence of systemic effects . thus, the lowest number of significantly upregulated genes was found in primary hepatocytes and in this model very few genes were significantly downregulated. this finding contradicts with our previous analysis in which we identified more than  <dig> up- and down-regulated genes in primary hepatocytes after  <dig> and  <dig> h treatment with wy <dig>  <cit> . this discrepancy can be explained by the application of different statistical methods in both studies, i.e. the former study used a linear models for microarray data without correction for fdr. in contrast, we applied a more stringent rp that corrects for fdr  <cit> .

the very low number of downregulated genes in primary hepatocytes may be explained by the absence of the non-parenchymal fraction, which is an abundant source of pro-inflammatory factors  <cit> . although it was shown that activation of pparα can suppress the immune response and downregulate gene expression in hepatocytes by antagonizing the nf-κb signaling pathway, the relevant experiments were performed in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli  <cit> . in contrast, our experiments in hepatocytes were performed under non-inflamed conditions, which may explain the very low number of significantly downregulated genes. in agreement with our results, a study performed in rat liver and rat primary hepatocytes treated with pparα ligands showed that downregulation of  genes occurred only in vivo
 <cit> .

in order to evaluate the relevance of in vitro and ex vivo models for the in vivo situation, we performed a comparative analysis of the significantly altered genes in each model by means of venn diagrams. in addition, pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to compare the direction of changes in gene expression in in vitro and ex vivo models vs. the in vivo situation. the results of venn diagram analysis showed substantial similarities between “simpler” liver models and the in vivo models, suggesting that primary hepatocytes and liver slices are relevant models to study pharmacological activation of pparα in vivo. with regard to the results of pearson’s correlation analysis, it revealed that almost all genes upregulated in vitro and ex vivo, were also upregulated in vivo. in contrast, only a small fraction of genes downregulated ex vivo was downregulated in vivo. these results indicate that primary hepatocytes and liver slices are valid liver models to study genes induced by activation of pparα with wy <dig>  but less suitable to study genes downregulated by activation of pparα with wy <dig>  this finding was unexpected and suggests that downregulation of genes by pparα is model-dependent. inasmuch as the cellular composition of liver slices is comparable to the liver in vivo, i.e. both models contain parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells  <cit> , these differences may be explained by systemic effects that are obviously absent ex vivo.

in all liver models, lipid metabolism emerged as a dominant pathway regulated by pparα  <cit> . despite the fact that there is a cross-talk between parenchymal and non-parenchymal fractions in regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism , we did not observe striking differences in regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism between our in vitro and ex vivo models, suggesting that the presence of non-parenchymal cells does not affect the wy14643-mediated regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. genes related to lipid metabolism were induced most significantly  in vivo, indicating that lipid metabolism is more sensitive to regulation in vivo compared to in vitro and ex vivo models. however, it can’t be ruled out that our results are biased by the lack of standardization of conditions across all liver models in relation to differences in concentration of glucose, insulin, or other biomolecules, which could also affect lipid metabolism.

next to the identification of processes related to different aspects of lipid catabolism, the “pparα-tailored analysis” identified genes, mostly in vivo, that could be assigned into novel functional categories not previously linked to pparα, such as “ecm”, “cytoskeleton”, “endothelial functions”, “integrity of golgi”, “vesicular trafficking”, and “endocytosis”. given the key role of pparα in regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism, we hypothesize that genes belonging to these novel categories might somehow be linked to transport, traffic, and catabolism of fa during activation of pparα by wy <dig>  it is possible that during pharmacological activation of pparα, fa and tg carried by lipoproteins and albumin freely pass fenestrated hepatic endothelial cells  <cit> . in hepatocytes, fa are taken up by transporters  <cit> , followed by poorly defined trafficking of fa to target organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes to undergo oxidation. consistent with this picture, we hypothesize that genes categorized as “endothelial functions” and “endocytosis” could be involved in transfer of fa through the endothelium, exemplified by the known pparα target angptl <dig>  which plays a role in vascular permeability  <cit> . in addition, adtrp, nrpt, e2f <dig> could also modulate endothelial permeability via interaction with vegf-b  <cit> . next, the traffic of fa to target organelles might be governed by genes in categories denoted as “ecm”, “cytoskeleton”, “integrity of golgi”, “endocytosis”, and “vesicular trafficking”. this notion is in line with an emerging concept of vesicular transport of fa to target organelles and cells co-occurring with reorganization of ecm, cytoskeleton, and golgi  <cit> . interestingly, similar functional categories have been linked to pparβ/δ in pancreatic β–cells including granule biosynthesis, intra-cellular vesicle trafficking, and exocytosis  <cit> . therefore, it could be hypothesized that all ppars may play a role in traffic of certain molecules in and out of the cell.

in addition to the above mentioned processes, several go processes and genes related to different aspects of immunity were significantly downregulated only in ex vivo and in vivo models . these findings are in concordance with the known anti-inflammatory properties of pparα  <cit> . however, in our study, due to the lack of inflammation, it seems to be more appropriate to refer to these processes as immunosuppression. immunosuppression was not observed in primary hepatocytes, suggesting that interaction with immune mediators and/or immune cells  is essential.

another novel gene functional category identified in this study exclusively in vivo is denoted as “neurotransmission”. currently, there is a scarce evidence for a crosstalk between pparα and the nervous system. however, recently it was shown that stimulation of the vagus nerve increased plasma endogenous pparα ligands co-occurring with upregulation of hepatic pparα expression and systemic anorectic effects  <cit> . another study showed that hepatic pparα activation led to glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance and hypertension via an afferent vagal nerve pathway  <cit> . it is possible, therefore, that activation of pparα by wy <dig> affects neurosignaling to coordinate liver metabolism with other organs and tissues to maintain energy homeostasis.

finally, in accordance with the known hepatocarcinogenic effect of peroxisomes proliferators in rodents  <cit> , we found that activation of pparα significantly upregulated several genes related to cell proliferation in vivo. surprisingly, this effect was absent in our in vitro and ex vivo liver models. given the fact that wy <dig> induces dna synthesis in rat hepatocytes after  <dig> hours, but not  <dig> hours  <cit> , it can be speculated that the  <dig> hours wy <dig> treatment in our in vitro model might be too short to detect the proliferative/carcinogenic changes. previously it was reported that treatment of mouse primary hepatocytes with peroxisomes proliferators  for  <dig> hours led to upregulation of  <dig> genes related to liver cancer   <cit> . however, it has to be stressed that none of these genes is strictly related to cell proliferation/carcinogenesis . consistent with the notion that kupffer cells play a central role in peroxisome proliferator-induced carcinogenesis, it was found that genes related to cell proliferation are induced by pparα ligands in rat liver but not in primary rat hepatocytes  <cit> .

our observation that treatment of liver slices with wy <dig> did not alter genes related to cell proliferation conflicts with the finding that peroxisomes proliferators induced dna synthesis in rodent co-cultures of hepatocytes with non-parenchymal cells  <cit> . a possible explanation for this discrepancy might be that to assess proliferative/carcinogenic properties of peroxisomes proliferators, measuring dna synthesis is more appropriate than analysis of genes related to cell proliferation. unfortunately, we cannot make a comparison of our gene expression data obtained in liver slices with gene expression obtained in other relevant rodent liver models, due to the lack of such data.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provides a comprehensive picture of gene expression during pharmacological activation of pparα by wy <dig> in different mouse hepatic models under not-inflamed conditions. pparα-dependent regulation of many genes and processes involved in lipid metabolism is mostly independent of the presence of non-parenchymal cells or inter-organ interactions, as it was observed in all liver models. pparα-dependent regulation of inflammatory genes requires the presence of non-parenchymal cells, because it was observed only ex vivo and in vivo. however, the full spectrum of pparα biology at the level of lipid metabolism, immunity, carcinogenesis, as well as novel aspects of pparα signaling such as coagulation, vesicular trafficking and the extracellular matrix, seems to require systemic factors, as it was observed exclusively in vivo.

although in vitro and ex vivo systems turned out to be relevant liver models to study the pparα transcriptome compared to the in vivo situation, liver slices behaved as an intermediate model between in vitro and in vivo, and thus represent a superior replacement for primary hepatocytes.
