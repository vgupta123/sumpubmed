BACKGROUND
in the past decades, genome-scale metabolic networks capable of simulating growth have been reconstructed for about twenty organisms  <cit> . a framework for constraint-based reconstruction and analysis  has been developed to model and simulate the steady states of metabolic networks  <cit> . as reviewed in the literature  <cit> , cobra has been successfully applied to studying the possible phenotypes. thus, it has attracted many attentions and gets rapid progress.

the cobra framework represents a metabolic network as a stoichiometric matrix s. with the homeostatic-steady-state hypothesis and fluxes boundaries, all allowable steady-state flux distributions are limited in a space which can be represented as

  sv= <dig> vimin≤vi≤vimax,i= <dig> ...,n 

where sm × n is the stoichiometric matrix for a network consisting of m metabolites and n fluxes and vn ×  <dig> is a vector of the flux levels through each reaction in the system  <cit> .

given the reversibility of reactions, an internal reversible reaction can be decoupled into two separate reactions for the forward and reverse directions separately. it means all fluxes should take a non-negative value and the solution space is now a convex polyhedral cone in high-dimensional space  <cit> . this convex cone can be spanned by a set of extreme pathways ,   <cit> . every possible steady-state flux distribution in the solution space may therefore be represented as a non-negative combination of extreme pathways :

  v=∑i=1kαipi,αi≥ <dig> ∀i 

extreme pathways  have the following properties which make them biologically meaningful  <cit> :

 <dig>  the expa set of a given network is unique.

 <dig>  each expa uses least reactions to be a functional unit.

 <dig>  the expa set is systemically independent which means an expa can't be decomposed into a non-negative combination of the remaining expas.

a similar network-based pathway definition as expa is elementary flux modes   <cit> . the algorithm for elementary flux modes  treats internal reversible reactions differently from that for expas. actually, expa set is a systemically independent subset of elementary flux modes  and each em can be represented by a non-negative combination of expas. the relationship and difference between expa and em have been studied and articulated in literatures  <cit> .

expas and ems lead to a systems view of network properties  <cit>  and they also provide a promising way to understand network functionality, robustness as well as regulation  <cit> . however, the number of expas for a reaction network grows exponentially with network size which makes the use of expas for large-scale networks computationally difficult  <cit> .

a rapid and scalable method to quantitatively characterize all allowable phenotypes of genome-scale networks is uniform random sampling  <cit> . it studies the contents of the available phenotypes by sampling the points in the solution space. the set of flux distributions obtained from sampling can be analyzed to measure the pairwise correlation coefficients between all reaction fluxes and can be further used to define correlated reaction sets . correlated reaction sets  are unbiased, condition-dependent definitions of modules in metabolic networks in which all the reactions have to be co-utilized in precise stoichiometric ratios  <cit> . it means the fluxes of the reactions in the same correlated reaction sets  go up or down together in fixed ratios. we may think about whether cosets provide clues about regulated procedures of a metabolic network.

both expas and cosets are determined by the topology of a metabolic network. although lots of analyses were done on them separately  <cit> , few attention has been paid to the relationship between them. here, our aim is to reveal the relationship between expas and cosets. we select escherichia coli core metabolic network, human red blood cell metabolic network and saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic network as examples to start our research.

RESULTS
escherichia coli core metabolic network
we use the e. coli core model published on the web site of ucsd's systems biology research group. it is "a condensed version of the genome-scale e. coli reconstruction and contains central metabolism reactions"  <cit> . details of this model can also be found in a published book  <cit> . the network contains  <dig> internal reactions,  <dig> exchange reactions and a biomass objective function.

the computation of the extreme pathways for e. coli core model results in  <dig> expas, in which  <dig> are type i or ii expas and  <dig> are type iii expas . the type i and ii expas will be focused on herein and the reason for neglecting type iii expas will be explained in methods section. twenty cosets are identified on this network based on pairwise correlation coefficients between all reaction fluxes and listed in table  <dig> 

this table lists all cosets of e. coli core model. we give each coset an id and list it in the first column. we list coset size and reactions it contained in the second and third column. reaction names are in abbreviated form. the abbreviation list is in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

for each coset cj, we check how many type i and ii expas use k reactions in cj, where k ranges from zero to the size of cj. the result is shown in table  <dig>  taking coset  <dig> as an example, from table  <dig> and  <dig>  we can find that  <dig> reactions , fort, pfl') belong to coset  <dig>  among all the type i and ii expas,  <dig> of them use all of these  <dig> reactions and  <dig> use none of them. no expa uses one or two reactions. it is clear that each expa of e. coli core model covers in each coset in an 'all or none' manner. we also calculate, for each expa pi, the ratio of reactions in any coset which is fully covered by pi to all reactions in pi. the distribution of the ratios is shown in figure  <dig>  each expa of e. coli core model covers at least one coset. the coverage rates are higher than 40% which implies that expas are under well control of cosets.

this table illustrates relationship between expas and cosets for e. coli core metabolic network. for each coset, we calculate how many expas cover k reactions in it where k ranges from  <dig> to size of this coset.

human red blood cell metabolic network
human red blood cell  metabolic network has been well reconstructed and simulated  <cit> . the rbc model consists  <dig> metabolites,  <dig> internal metabolic reactions  as well as  <dig> exchange fluxes   <cit> .

there are  <dig> expas calculated from the stoichiometric matrix of rbc model, among which  <dig> are type i or ii expas and the others are type iii expas. we focus on type i and ii expas only. type i and ii expas are described in additional file  <dig>  eight cosets are identified on rbc model. all cosets are listed in table  <dig>  the cosets of rbc show agreement with the currently known regulatory structure  <cit> . there are  <dig> reactions regulated by inhibitors and activators or through post-translational modification. most of them belong to some coset and most of cosets have at least  <dig> regulated reaction. for example, regulated reactions 'g6pdh' and 'pdgh' belong to coset 1; 'tki', 'ta' and 'tkii' belong to coset 2; 'rpi' and 'pfk' belong to coset 3; 'en' and 'pk' belong to coset 4; 'adprt' belongs to coset  <dig>  although there's no regulated reaction in coset  <dig>  it shares the metabolite 'r5p' with regulated reactions 'r5pi', 'tki' and 'prppsyn'. so the reactions in coset  <dig> can be considered as being regulated indirectly. the other  <dig> reactions, 'prppsyn' and 'impase', don't belong to any coset.

this table lists all cosets of rbc model. we give each coset an id and list it in the first column. we list coset size and reactions it contained in the second and third column. reaction names are in abbreviated form. the abbreviation list is in table  <dig> and the list of internal reactions is in additional file  <dig> 

the relationship between expas and cosets is shown in table  <dig>  each coset is covered by an expa in an 'all or none' manner, except the cosets  <dig> and  <dig>  as for cosets  <dig> and  <dig>  some expas cover them in an 'all or none' manner and others cover them in 'one or all but one' mode. we look over the two exceptions to see which reactions are used by each expa and which are not used. as to coset  <dig>  there are  <dig> expas covering it in an 'all or none' manner and  <dig> expas overlapping with it in a 'one or all but one' mode. among these  <dig> expas,  <dig> expas use one and the same one reaction 'pgi' while other  <dig> expas use all the reactions in coset  <dig> only except the reaction 'pgi'. similar situation can be found in coset  <dig>  there are  <dig> expas overlapping with it in a 'one or all but one' mode, among which  <dig> expas use the same reaction 'r5pi' while other  <dig> expas cover all reactions but 'r5pi'.

this table illustrates relationship between expas and cosets for rbc metabolic network. for each coset, we calculate how many expas cover k reactions in it where k ranges from  <dig> to size of this coset.

the reasons for the complementary relationship on usage of reactions in coset  <dig> and coset  <dig> are as follows. 'pgi' belongs to one of 'historical' metabolic pathways named embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway , while all other internal reactions in coset  <dig> are in pathway pentose phosphate pathway . as for coset  <dig>  'r5pi' belongs to pathway ppp and all other reactions are in emp. since emp provides the metabolite 'g6p' to ppp and inversely, ppp offers the metabolite 'ga3p' to emp, the two pathways should cooperate with each other to fulfill the functions of the metabolic network. in order to work normally, the metabolic network may either utilize an expa using all the reactions in coset  <dig>  or combine two  expas together to fully cover coset <dig> . by splitting some coset on different expas, it may bring redundancy and flexibility which are important properties for a cell to survive in various environments.

both 'ex_nadp' and 'ex_nadph' belong to coset  <dig>  indicating the need of rbc cell to balance the nadph/nadp ratio. according to "historically" partition of metabolic pathways, when pathway ppp is up-regulated, the quantity of nadp increases. when metabolic pathway emp is up-regulated, the quantity of nadph comes up. from the point of view of expa, 'ex_nadp', 'ex_nadph' are used together in opposite direction by expas. it means that the fluxes through these reactions increase or decrease together. as a result, the quantity of nadp increases when that of nadph decreases and vice versa. situation is similar for reactions 'ex_nad' and 'ex_nadh' in coset  <dig> 

saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic network
a full compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic model for s. cerevisiae, ind <dig>  has been reconstructed and validated in  <dig>  <cit> . we use this model to represent the metabolism of s. cerevisiae. model ind <dig> accounts for  <dig> metabolites,  <dig> internal reactions as well as  <dig> exchange fluxes excluding the objective reaction. since the scale of ind <dig> is too large, enumerating all the expas of the model is computational intractable. thus we samples a subset of expas to represent the whole expas . the sampling procedure has executed  <dig> times with 250– <dig> internal reactions being randomly removed out every time and finally resulted a sample set of  <dig> unique expas. the lengths of sample expas range from  <dig> to  <dig> . it is difficult to sample the expas containing more than  <dig> reactions within acceptable cost of time.

one hundred and thirty five cosets have been identified for this model. some cosets, especially the cosets containing more than  <dig> reactions, have no sample expa passing through as if they are forgotten by the metabolic network. we name them cosets of solitary island. we have tried different methods, such as removing all reactions which cannot be reached from a certain coset of solitary island, to sample some expas passing through the 'solitary island' but in vain because the sampling procedures take too much time. it seems that, the reactions in a coset of solitary island together with the reactions related to them form a complex network, and expas usually have to take a long way to go from some exchange reactions to a coset of solitary island and finally reach other exchange reactions. because of the network's complexity, there are many bypaths along the road which causes a combinatorial explosion. so a coset of solitary island is not really solitary, and it is not too few but too many expas passing through these cosets that prevent the expas computation algorithm, one step of which is enumerating all possible combinatorial paths, from catching them.

cosets and the relationship between expas and cosets are completely listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> separately. due to the limited space, part of them are shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  figure  <dig> is the cosets coverage rate distribution of s. cerevisiae model. we find that leaving out of the cosets of solitary island, almost all the cosets are covered by expas in an 'all or none' manner except coset  <dig> which is covered by expas in a complemental mode. coset  <dig> has three reaction members, 'akgmal', 'akgt2r' and 'malt2r'. reaction 'akgmal' transports alpha ketoglutarate  and malate  across the epicyte in opposite directions. reaction 'akgt2r' transports akg and hydrogen ion  across the epicyte in the same directions. and 'malt2r' transports mal and h across the epicyte in the same directions as well. if the quantity of akg rises, the fluxes through 'akgmal' will grow up taking akg and h out of the cell and bringing mal into the cell. as a result, the quantity of h rises causing an increase on the flux of 'malt2r'. vice versa. these three reactions work together to balance the akg/mal ratio inside the cell and thus form a coset. among the sample expas, we find that some of them utilize 'akgmal' and 'akgt2r' while others use 'malt2r' only. but, there are also some expas utilizing 'akgt2r' while we don't find any sample expas that use the other two reactions in the coset. however, according to the above analysis, there should be some complemental expas utilizing reactions in the coset other than 'akgt2r'. otherwise, the cell will die due to the insupportable internal environment. since the whole expa set is extremely large, the available expa sample set can only give a glance at the tremendous expa set and will certainly lose some information.

this table lists the no solitary island cosets of s. cerevisiae metabolic network model with set size no less than  <dig>  we give each coset an id and list it in the first column. we list coset size and reactions it contained in the second and third column. reaction names are in abbreviated form. the abbreviation list is in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

this table illustrates relationship between expas and cosets for s. cerevisiae metabolic network. the cosets listed here correspond to those in table  <dig>  for each coset, we calculate how many expas cover k reactions in it where k ranges from  <dig> to size of this coset.

the scale of s. cerevisia metabolic network is much larger. however, complementary relationship on usage of reactions in a coset is repeated as that in e. coli core metabolic network and rbc metabolic network.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated the relationship between cosets and expas on the in-silicon representations of three metabolic networks. these models are different in species and scale. however, the experiment on each model leads to similar results that expas show strong complementary relationship on the usage of reactions in the same coset. it implies that this kind of relationship may exist in most of organisms. since both cosets and expas are generated from the topology information of metabolic networks, this phenomenon may reflect some inherent properties resulting from the topology constraints composed on the networks.

moreover, our study not only reveals the interesting relationship between cosets and expas but also provides a new sight of how the metabolic network works and how it is adjusted. the strong relationship between cosets and expas provides clues about regulated procedure of a metabolic network, thus suggests a possible mechanism of how a metabolic network transferring its phenotype from one steady state to another. as functional units, expas are in control of the regulatory structure of the metabolic network, and the regulatory command usually spreads from regulated reactions to cosets and finally to the related expas. as fluxes through each expa change according to the regulatory orders from its corresponding cosets, the flux distribution of the whole metabolic network transfers towards a new steady state. by interrogating the relationship between cosets and expas, we can tell which expas are possible to be up  regulated caused by an increasing  flux in a given coset. this result may help predict the function of regulatory factors acting on metabolism. however, in order to answer the question which expas are really regulated, more information should be considered, such as regulatory structure of the metabolic networks as well as kinetic and thermodynamic constraints, which will be our future work.
