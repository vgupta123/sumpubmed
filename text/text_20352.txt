BACKGROUND
enzymes represent a significant fraction of an individual proteome  <cit>  and catalyze a variety of specific reactions in the cellular systems  <cit> . hence, identification of the functions of an entire complement of enzymes in an organism helps generate the metabolic blueprint of that species. this will not only improve our understanding of defined cellular processes of individual species but also help study the metabolic interdependence of multiple species in an ecosystem such as the human gut microbiome.

the enzyme commission   <cit>  has classified all enzymes based on the enzymatic reactions they catalyze. each enzyme has an ec number, which is a hierarchical number that distinguishes enzymes by the type of reactions they catalyze. the ec groups all enzymes into six broad classes that include  oxidoreductases - catalyze oxidoreduction reactions;  transferases - catalyze the transfer of a chemical group from a donor to an acceptor;  hydrolases - catalyze the hydrolysis of various bonds;  lyases - enzymes that cleave bonds by means other than by hydrolysis;  isomerases - catalyze geometrical or structural changes within one molecule; and  ligases - catalyze the joining of two molecules coupled with hydrolysis of a pyrophosphate bond in atp or a similar triphosphate. the ec classification system assigns a unique four-field number to each enzymatic activity ) where, the first three numbers  of an ec number represent progressively finer description of the enzymatic reaction, while the last level mostly represents substrate specificity of a reaction  <cit> .

experimental characterization of the enzymatic reactions of all enzymes in a genome or a metagenome is a tedious and expensive task. with the exception of a few well-characterized genomes such as escherichia coli  and yeast, the fraction of experimentally annotated enzymes in many sequenced genomes is very small. the problem is more pronounced in the metagenomic samples where even the species are not adequately cultured or characterized. to address this problem, computational approaches, which can build accurate models from known data to predict the unknown data, have been employed. such models have been widely used to predict protein functions and annotate newly sequenced genomes  <cit> .

several computational methods exist for predicting enzyme classes . many of them use electronically inferred annotations by transferring the annotations  of a known enzyme to an unknown enzyme, if the features of unknown match with the known. most of the methods differ by the type of features they use to match proteins, which broadly include amino acid composition  <cit> , sequence or structure homology  <cit> , domain composition  <cit>  and sequence motifs  <cit> . a variety of machine learning  and data mining algorithms, including nearest-neighbor methods  <cit> , support vector machines   <cit> , bayesian  <cit>  and ensemble approaches  <cit>  have been employed to build models for enzyme classification. the performance of these methods varies based on the classification algorithm, input datasets and features used for model building. nevertheless, most of the existing methods fail to predict ec levels  <dig> and  <dig> due to the increasing difficulty in predicting the finer levels in the hierarchy, thus offer only limited value to enzyme annotations. many enzyme prediction methods exhibit a lack of balance between specificity and sensitivity; ezypred  <cit>  and eficaz <dig>   <cit>  offer limited sensitivity for certain enzyme classes and/or ec levels and run extremely slow with high false positive rates. hence, the existing methods are inadequate for annotation of high-throughput sequences generated from genomic and metagenomic projects, warranting the need for developing a new computational method.

the current study requires the identification of all enzymes encoded by the gut microbiome in human because the enzymes encoded by the gut microbiota play an extensive role in the human metabolism. human gut microbiome is the largest and most complex of all microbial communities that harbor human body, with a gene set that is about  <dig> times larger than that of the human gene set  <cit> . human gut microbiome alone is estimated to contain about 1000- <dig> different species  <cit> , but a majority of them are yet to be characterized. these bacterial communities extensively contribute to human gut metabolism by complementing enzymes that are not encoded by the human genome, but are essential for digestion of complex polysaccharides, absorption, metabolism of amino acids and vitamins, shaping of the immunological environment and a wide range of other metabolic functions  <cit> . changes in the composition of human microbiota have been linked to health conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease , antibiotic-resistant infections, obesity, colon cancer, symptomatic atherosclerosis and diabetes  <cit> . hence, the identification and functional characterization of gut microbial enzymes is a very important step towards understanding the microbe-dependent component of the human metabolism.

in this study, we developed a new hierarchical enzyme classification method based on machine learning that accurately predicts if a protein sequence is an enzyme or a non-enzyme, and if an enzyme, what is the specific enzymatic reaction  it carries out. we apply this method to identify the full enzyme complements of  <dig> sequenced genomes of model organisms, and also those of the microbial species in the metagenomic samples obtained from human gut microbiomes. the methodology developed in this project and its application to identifying the full complements of microbial enzymes has made it feasible to study the role of microbe-complemented enzymes in the human gut metabolism. to our knowledge, this study represents a novel and robust approach to studying the pathway level host-pathogen interactions in the human gut metabolism.

RESULTS
we describe the results and discussion in two separate sections that include the method development followed by its application to study the pathways in human gut metabolism. figure  <dig> shows a schematic of the method and its application. an ensemble of five different machine-learning  classifiers was used to build prediction models based on protein domains that include sequence or structure-derived features. hence, this method is named as ecemble . bayesian network  <cit>  model represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies, whereas naïve bayes  <cit>  works under the strong assumption that there is independence among the features. k-nearest neighbor   <cit>  is 'instance based' learning algorithm. despite its simplicity, it can offer very good performance. we tried polynomial and linear kernels in svm  <cit>  and polynomial kernel was found to be working better than the linear kernel. random forest classifiers   <cit>  work by generating large number of decision trees in a specific random way such that each one is de-correlated with the others. each classifier model generates a probability distribution for all classes for each instance in the train and test set and the class with the highest probability is assigned as the predicted class.

this is a hierarchical prediction method that predicts enzymes and enzyme classes at  <dig> levels , where the first model at l <dig> predicts if a protein is an enzyme or a non-enzyme, and the subsequent models from l <dig> to l <dig> predict specific class and subclass of an enzyme in the ec number hierarchy. the predictions are selected by a consensus approach, i.e., only when at least two of the three top-performing ml classifiers show consistent predictions. to demonstrate its usefulness, we applied this method to predict the full complement of enzymes from ten sequenced proteomes. in addition, we also tested about  <dig>  million protein sequences that were obtained from metagenomic sequencing and assembly of the human gut microbiome  <cit> . using the full complements of enzymes from human and human gut microbiomes, we further investigated the role of microbe-derived enzymes in the human gut metabolism.

development of ecemble method
feature selection and optimization
we collected the known enzyme and non-enzyme protein sequences as positive and negative datasets, respectively. sequences were clustered at 70% identity to generate  <dig>  enzyme and  <dig>  non-enzyme sequences, where each sequence has mapping to at least one of the following databases. these sequences were mapped against three domain databases that include pfam  <cit> , superfamily  <cit>  and prosite  <cit>  to extract the enzyme-specific and non-enzyme-specific features . a protein domain is a conserved part of a protein's sequence or structure that can evolve, function, and exist independently of the rest of the protein chain. we used three domain databases that include pfam, superfamily and prosite to represent the functional, structural and motif or active site regions of protein domains, respectively. these domains are used as features, where, in combination they offer a comprehensive feature set for ml methods to discriminate between enzymes and non-enzymes. we extracted  <dig>  and  <dig>  overlapping features for enzyme and non-enzyme datasets, respectively, from three domain databases .

*common between enzyme and non-enzyme sequences

to facilitate the building of an effective ml-based classifier, it is essential to represent the domain features of each sequence in a binary format , using '1' for the presence and '0' for the absence of a domain. the size of the feature vector matrix is n × ∑ , where n is the total number of enzyme and non-enzyme sequences, and p, q and r represent the total number of mapped domains in pfam, superfamily and prosite, respectively . in theory, the dimensionality of this vector gets very large; however, since each protein sequence contains only a few domains, we used the sparse-formatting option by storing the occurrence of features with their locations in the feature space to significantly speed up the model building process.

$both enzyme and non-enzyme sequences

hierarchical design of prediction models
we applied five different machine-learning  algorithms to best exploit features from the training dataset and optimize at each level. these include naïve bayes, k-nearest neighbor  classifier, support vector machine , decision stump   <cit>  and random forest  classifiers . ml algorithms are employed to learn discriminative features of classes from the training data, build models, and test how related the unknown instances  are to these models. we used the weka   <cit>  framework to build prediction models in an iterative fashion at  <dig> different levels . as part of the enzyme identification step, the first model at l <dig> predicts if a protein sequence is an enzyme or not. only the sequences predicted as enzymes at l <dig> are forwarded to build models for predicting enzyme classes and subclasses at l1-l <dig>  sequentially. at l <dig>  there are only two classes  and similarly, at l <dig>  there are only  <dig> enzyme classes; hence, one model is sufficient to predict classes at these two levels. however, the six enzyme classes at l <dig> are further divided into  <dig> subclasses at l <dig>  as a result,  <dig> prediction models are constructed to predict  <dig> subclasses at l <dig>  similarly, due to the increasing number of subclasses at each subsequent level,  <dig> and  <dig> models are constructed to predict  <dig> and  <dig>  subclasses at l <dig> and l <dig>  respectively . this hierarchical design of prediction models ensures that subclasses of a superclass are not predicted outside of that superclass and hence minimize false positives. for instance, members of ec  <dig> x.x.x superclass are never predicted as members of ec  <dig> x.x.x, and so on and so forth.

level-0
*correctly predicted: instances predicted by at least  <dig> of top  <dig> classifiers. level- <dig> represents the model to predict if a protein sequence is an enzyme or not. level 1-level  <dig> represents corresponding levels of the ec number hierarchy.

evaluation of prediction performance
all feature vectors were randomly divided into  <dig> and  <dig> percent subsets for training and testing, respectively. since the datasets are unbalanced across classes , class distributions are approximately preserved at all ec levels using stratified partitioning for training and testing sets. we used a two-step validation procedure that include determining a10-fold cross-validation accuracy on the training set, and the testing accuracy using the testing dataset that is not a part of the training data. we also report standard performance measures over each class at each level, including true positive rate , false positive rate , and receiver operating characteristic  curves and the area under the curve . please refer to the methods section for more details.

*ten-fold cross validation accuracy. at ec l <dig> and ec l <dig> using ml classifiers, decision stump , naïve bayes classifier , k-nearest neighbor , support vector machine , and random forest classifier . at ec l <dig>  train and test sets contain  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences respectively, whereas ec l <dig> contain train and test sets of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

consensus-based ensemble approach
a consensus approach adds confidence to the prediction accuracy and drastically reduces the false positives; hence, we implemented it by considering only those predictions, where the same enzyme class is predicted for a sequence by at least two out of the top three classifiers. table  <dig> shows the overall prediction accuracy for testing data at each level  after using the consensus approach. we achieved an overall accuracy of  <dig> % at l <dig> for identifying enzymes and non-enzymes, and at least  <dig> % accuracy using models at l <dig> to l <dig> for predicting enzyme classes and subclasses. these results are very promising despite the fact that the size of the training data per model kept diminishing as the number of models increase at the lower levels . it can also be noted that at l <dig>   <dig> % of the correctly predicted instances are consistent across the top three classifiers, while at l1-l <dig>  over 99% of the correctly predicted instances are consistent .

effect of sequence identity in the training dataset
sequence redundancy in the training datasets often results in overtraining and inaccurate estimation of prediction accuracy. to test the effect of sequence identity on the prediction accuracy, we created four datasets at 70%, 60%, 50% and 40% sequence identities using the cd-hit clustering algorithm  <cit>  and accordingly labeled as cdh <dig>  cdh <dig>  cdh <dig>  and cdh <dig>  at lower sequence identity thresholds like 40%, more sequences got removed resulting in a fewer number of sequences in each enzyme class compared to datasets with higher sequence identities. similarly, the number of enzyme classes containing minimum number of sequences  for model building started to go down from thresholds  <dig> to  <dig> percent identity . we generated the enzyme prediction models for ec levels l0-l <dig> for all the  <dig> datasets . we needed at least  <dig> sequences in each subclass to build models using 10-fold cross validation. accuracy is the highest for the cdh <dig> dataset  compared to all other datasets  ; hence, we used this dataset for model building. the 70% sequence identity is considered an optimal threshold in many other ml datasets, because the enzyme function starts to diverge quickly when the sequence identity is below 70%  <cit> .

comparison of ecemble with other methods
we compared the performance of ecemble with that of two existing methods, blast and eficaz  <cit> . we chose these two methods because a number of methods are blast-based homology searching methods and eficaz is a popular open-source tool. we used the same train and test datasets against these three methods to compare their performance. in the first step, a blast database was created with train dataset and the test data was queried against it for enzyme identification. because blast generates a number of hits for each query with varying levels of confidence, only the top hit was considered  as the prediction for each sequence in the test set. to predict the enzyme classes and subclasses, we performed a second query against a blast database created using only the enzyme sequences and used the same procedure as in the first step. similarly, eficaz method was trained and tested for both enzyme identification and classification. we also used four different clustered datasets  that were described earlier. for enzyme identification, ecemble reports the highest accuracy  compared to blast  and eficaz  using cdh <dig> dataset . it can also be seen that the accuracy goes down as the percent identity in the datasets goes down from  <dig> to 40; however, this effect is more pronounced in the blast method compared to ecemble and eficaz suggesting that reduced identity has minimal effect on these two methods. similarly for enzyme classification at l <dig>  the overall accuracy of ecemble  is better than blast  and eficaz  methods using cdh <dig> dataset . we compared four different sequence identity thresholds  of this dataset and our method performed better than others irrespective of the dataset used. these results convincingly demonstrate that the ecemble method consistently performed better than blast and eficaz methods at all identity thresholds , and that it is also suitable for accurate annotation of protein sequences with low sequence identity. hence, in the next section, we used ecemble to identify and annotate complete enzyme complements of the sequenced genomes and metagenomes and applied this method to study the role of gut microbiome-derived enzymes in human metabolism.

application of ecemble method
annotation of full complements of enzymes in sequenced genomes
the ability of ecemble to predict solely based on a protein sequence enables it to annotate full complements of enzymes from sequenced genomes as well as from mixed genomes such as metagenomic samples. we applied ecemble to annotate a large number of unknown or unclassified enzyme sequences from  <dig> proteomes  of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic model organisms . as seen in figure  <dig>  e. coli and yeast proteomes have a high fraction of known enzymes  compared to less than 5% in most of the other species. in contrast, the fractions of ecemble predicted enzymes are smaller in e. coli and yeast , but reach up to 12% in chicken and zebrafish proteomes. in human and mouse, the fractions of unknown or unclassified enzymes predicted by ecemble account to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of their proteomes, respectively. these data underscore an important and generic application of our method that is to annotate a large number of unknown enzymes and enzyme classes in the sequenced genomes.

we further investigated about  <dig> newly predicted enzymes from the reviewed human proteome sequences , that were either not known as enzymes or had partially annotated enzyme subclasses. these  <dig> enzymes map to  <dig> unique enzyme reactions , of which, only  <dig> are not previously known to be in human. table  <dig> lists these  <dig> enzymes with the current annotation in uniprot and the predicted annotation by ecemble. note that despite the well-characterized nature of the reviewed proteins, ecemble method is able to complement or correct the existing enzyme annotations . for instance, human genes such as foxred <dig>  and sccpdh  have been broadly known as oxidoreductases and accordingly labeled as  <dig> -.-.-, in the uniprot database. ecemble method predicted the specific reactions of these enzymes as malate dehydrogenase   and saccharopine dehydrogenase , l-glutamate-forming) , respectively. in certain cases , ecemble predictions differ only at the subclass levels , while in a small number of cases , the predictions also differ from the current annotations at the class level . hence, experimental validation of these predictions is worth pursuing in the future. because ecemble prediction models are built only from reviewed enzyme sequences, the accuracy and coverage of prediction by our model will continue to improve as the newly characterized enzymes from experimental studies become available. these results prove that ecemble method that solely uses protein sequences for prediction, is highly promising for the identification and classification of full complements of enzymes in the sequenced genomes.

prediction of enzymes from the gut microbiome
to understand the role played by the most densely colonized human microbiome  in human metabolism, we would require a catalogue of all the enzymes that can potentially exist in the human gut environment. there are several hundreds to thousands of microbial species that inhabit human gut and many of them are unknown, under characterized or not culturable in laboratory conditions, which would have made our goal impossible to accomplish. however, next-generation sequencing  data from metagenomic samples could be used for de novo assembly of microbial genomes, and consequently for the prediction of the translated proteomes from the assembled scaffolds. we applied the ecemble method on  <dig>  million proteins from metagenomic sequences  and assigned  <dig>   sequences to  <dig> distinct enzymatic reactions . of these,  <dig> reactions are also encoded in human, leaving  <dig> reactions that are exclusively encoded by human gut microbial genomes. of these,  <dig> enzymes are known gut bacterial enzymes in swissprot database, while the remaining  <dig> enzymes are newly predicted by the ecemble method.

role of gut microbial enzymes on human metabolism
application of ecemble to identify the enzymes and enzyme classes in human and gut microbial species has enabled us to ask the following questions. which gut microbial enzymes are involved in human metabolism? which human pathways are partly or fully driven by microbe-derived enzymes? are there any previously unknown microbial enzymes that are involved in human gut metabolism? even though, gut microbiome can contains bacteria, fungi and other small eukaryotes, about 98% of the gut microbial enzymes used in this study originated from bacteria  <cit> , hence we limited this study only to bacteria-derived enzymes. to answer these questions, we created  <dig> different sets of enzymes.  known human enzyme reactions  ,  unknown human enzyme reactions that are predicted by ecemble ,  known bacterial enzyme reactions in the gut microflora predicted by ecemble  and  unknown gut bacterial enzyme reactions that are predicted by ecemble . for human and bacteria, known enzymes were obtained from swissprot and kegg   <cit>  databases .

we mapped both human- and gut bacteria-encoded enzymes to the kegg reference pathways to identify  <dig> human metabolic pathways, where each pathway contains both human- and bacteria-encoded enzymes plus at least one of them is predicted by ecemble. we refer to them henceforth as gut microbe complemented  pathways. the first set  contains human enzymes that are complemented by known gut bacterial enzymes. this set serves to validate the known role of gut bacteria in human metabolism . the second set  is same as the first one; in addition, contains predicted enzymes  from gut bacterial species. these nine gmc pathways reveal the role of newly discovered gut bacterial enzymes in human gut metabolism, which is made possible with the ecemble method . all the  <dig> pathways are mapped with enzymes  using a color-coded format. light red colored enzymes represent known human enzymes, pink represents unknown human enzymes that are predicted by ecemble, light green represents known bacterial enzyme reactions in the gut microflora predicted by ecemble and light blue represents unknown gut bacterial enzyme reactions that are predicted by ecemble.

functional distribution of gmc pathways is shown in figure 5a and a full list of  <dig> pathways is given in additional file  <dig>  gmc pathways contribute to the metabolism of a variety of nutrients that primarily include carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins and cofactors. thus, the metabolic role of gmc pathways closely matches with the known nutritional requirements of humans. our results show that gut microbial enzymes also play a role in lipid and energy metabolism and also in the metabolism of terpenoids, polyketides and derived amino acids such as taurine, d-glutamine, etc. our method predicted  <dig> carbohydrate active enzymes   in the human gut microbiome that include carbohydrate esterases, glycoside hydrolases, glycosyl transferases and polysaccharide lyases, which are primarily involved in carbohydrate metabolic pathways. as shown in figure 5b, human- and microbe-derived enzymes complement different categories of human metabolic pathways. note that  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exclusively microbe-derived enzymes complement the amino acid, carbohydrate and vitamin/cofactor metabolic pathways, respectively, which underscores their pivotal role as well as the dependency of human pathways on microbe-derived enzymes. microbes not only complement, but also supplement some of the enzyme functions that are common to both human and microbes. for instance, we found that  <dig> enzymatic reactions are shared between human and gut-bacterial species; and we hypothesize that some of these common enzymes that are secreted by bacteria could supplement to perform human metabolic functions, and vice-versa. these common enzymes are highlighted in blue color in the additional file  <dig>  these results empirically support the argument that symbiotic gut microbiome has coevolved with human  and they play a huge role in the metabolic interactions between host-gut microbiota  <cit> .

humans lack the enzymes needed to degrade oxalate  <cit> . it has been shown that the bacterial degradation of oxalate is carried by oxalobacter formigenes in the human intestinal tract and the absence of oxalobacter formigenes is considered a risk factor for urolithiasis  <cit> . similarly choline, an essential dietary nutrient, is found to be metabolized in the liver by the gut microbial enzymes. thus conversion of dietary choline is used as a metabolic hallmark for liver and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . similarly, nitrate reductase that converts nitrate into nitrite and nitric oxide, is synthesized only by gut microbiome; elevated levels of nitric oxide have been associated with both ibd and obesity-induced insulin resistance  <cit> . gut microbiome also plays a crucial role in the metabolism of xenobiotics; at least thirty commercially available drugs are shown to be metabolized as substrates by bacterial enzymes  <cit> . on the other hand, gut microbiome is also a source of inflammatory molecules such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan that may contribute to metabolic diseases  <cit> .

gut microbe-complemented pathways for dietary carbohydrate metabolism
carbohydrates are a major component of the human diet that includes starch  and disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose. human gut bacteria produce a vast panel of cazymes to degrade components of dietary fiber into metabolisable monosaccharides and disaccharides  <cit> . the human genome encodes at best  <dig> digestive enzymes  <cit> ; for ex. lactase, α-amylase, maltase, isomaltase and sucrose. it has been known that human enzymes can hydrolyze disaccharides  and starch, but not other complex polysaccharides  <cit> . hence, our ability to digest dietary plant carbohydrates resides entirely in our gut, where gut microbe-derived enzymes can hydrolyze complex dietary carbohydrates by producing a variety of cazymes  <cit> . thirteen gut bacterial enzymes predicted by ecemble were mapped in starch and sucrose metabolism pathway as shown in figure  <dig>  enzymes responsible for the conversion of sucrose to glucose and bacterial degradation of pectin  and xylan  are shown in the table  <dig>  these enzymes are predicted by our ecemble method from the gut microbial metagenomic data.

another gmc pathway, fructose and mannose metabolism, explains how bacterial enzymes complement human enzymes to metabolize dietary sugars . fructose occurs as a free monosaccharide and an isomer of glucose. in figure  <dig>  predicted bacteria-encoded enzymes and known human-encoded enzymes are shown, where d-fructose  is catalyzed by bacterial enzymes, protein-n  -phosphohistidine-sugar phosphotransferase  and fructokinase  into d-fructose- <dig> phosphate and β-d-fructose- <dig> phosphate, respectively. β-d-fructose-6p is metabolized to glyceraldehyde-3p using human-encoded enzymes phosphofructokinase  and fructose-biphosphate aldolase . the glyceraldehyde-3p compound is a part of the glycolysis  pathway, which is the main energy generating mechanism in the body. this pathway demonstrates that the bacteria- and human-encoded enzymes complement and work in unison in the digestion and energy metabolism pathways.

analysis of enzyme profiles of obese and ibd subjects
a recent study published the metagenomic profiles of obese, lean and inflammatory bowel disease  subjects  <cit> . this study also reported the translated gene products of gut microbiome from  <dig> metagenomic subject samples. we used these protein sequences to predict all the enzymes in each subject with our ecemble method, and analyzed the enzyme profiles of 'obese versus lean'  and 'ibd versus non-ibd'  subjects. we identified  <dig> unique bacterial enzymes that are not encoded in human from the metagenomic samples of obesity, lean, ibd and non-ibd subjects. these include  <dig> known and  <dig> previously unknown enzymes in gut bacterial species. details on how these enzyme reactions maps to kegg human pathways are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the taxonomic distribution of bacterial species from metagenomic samples is also shown in additional file  <dig>  the frequencies of enzymes present in the subjects were normalized based on the number of subjects in the obese/lean and ibd/non-ibd comparison groups and a fisher's exact-test  using r  <cit>  was conducted to determine the significantly enriched or depleted enzymes in the obese and ibd subjects . of the obesity-enriched enzymes, the most significant enzyme  is polygalacturonase , which is encoded by bacteroides and prevotella species, and carries out pentose and glucuronate interconversions in starch and sucrose metabolism . in contrary, urease  encoding bacteria are found in fewer number of obese subjects compared to lean subjects , suggesting that the loss or absence of this enzyme may be associated with obesity. in our analysis of ibd bacterial enzymes , we found that non-ibd subjects predominantly host bacterial populations that contain an enzyme, glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase  compared to the ibd group. this enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of l-rhamnose in bacteria. while there is no direct evidence to link lower levels of l-rhamnose to ibd, increased lactulose/l-rhamnose permeability ratio or decreased l-rhamnose in human intestinal permeability is found to be associated with ibd  <cit> . hence, the consequences of the absence of bacterial populations that produce l-rhamnose in the ibd patients is worth investigating by experimental studies. the distribution of significant  enzymes in obese/lean and ibd/non-ibd groups is presented in figure  <dig>  the comprehensive list of enzymes in each category  is given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
a consensus-based ensemble method, ecemble, was implemented to identify enzymes from non-enzymes, and to hierarchically predict the class and subclasses of an enzyme up to l <dig> of the ec number. comparison against blast and eficaz methods showed superior performance of ecemble, both in coverage and accuracy. the superior coverage can be attributed to the generic protein domain feature space used in this method, while the improved accuracy resulted from the stringent consensus-based ensemble approach. application of ecemble to predict full complements of enzymes from  <dig> sequenced genomes of model organisms has generated new annotations for unknown enzymes as well as full annotations for undercharacterized enzymes. similarly, ecemble method enabled us to predict bacterial enzymes present in the gut microbiome and consequently use them to study the dependence of human metabolism on gut microbe-derived enzymes. mapping of human and microbe-derived enzymes to kegg metabolic pathways revealed that gut microbe-derived enzymes, especially those involved in the digestion of dietary nutrients, are essential components of a number of human pathways. further application of this method to study the profiles of gut microbe-derived enzymes in lean versus obese, and ibd versus non-ibd subjects showed that certain enzymes were significantly enriched or depleted in these comparison groups, warranting further studies to understand the role of these enzymes on certain disease conditions. two important merits of ecemble are that it can predict solely based on the protein sequence and also fully annotates enzymes by hierarchically assigning classes and subclasses up to l <dig>  hence, it can be a valuable tool for accurately annotating the entire enzyme complements of individual genomes as well as the mixed genomes from metagenomic studies. as evident from this study, ecemble can be effectively used to study the metabolic interactions between the host and microbes or those among the members of a community in a microflora. being a generic method, it can be applied to study the systems level pathway interactions in any organism or microbial community.
