BACKGROUND
salinity and drought are one of the major environmental stresses that limit worldwide plant growth and crop production. plants have evolved multiple sophisticated strategies to cope with the adverse stresses via perceiving the stress signal and transmitting the information through a variety of signal transduction pathways and adjustment of their metabolic processes; upon receipt of the signal, a number of molecular and cellular responses are initiated  <cit> . the aba -based complex signal transduction cascades are critical for plant adaptation to environmental stresses  <cit> . recent studies have identified many components acting between aba perception and abiotic stress responses, including aba biosynthetic enzymes and regulatory intermediates such as kinases, transcription factors and ubiquitin ligases  <cit> . among these, e <dig> ubiqutin ligases were reported to participate in activation of aba response and degradation of signaling components associated with the stress responses  <cit> . abi <dig>  is a member of arabidopsis basic leucine zipper  transcription factor family that inhibits aba-dependent seed germination and post-germination growth  <cit> . keg is a multi-domain ring-type e <dig> ligase required for maintaining low levels of abi <dig> in the absence of aba  <cit> . whereas over-expression of keg leads to aba insensitivity, disruption of keg gene expression results in growth arrest immediately after seed germination.

recently, the post-transcriptional regulation of aba- and stress-responsive genes by a group of mirnas has received much attention  <cit> . over-expressing mir396c conferred sensitivity to salinity and alkaline stress  <cit> . the stress-regulated mir393-guided cleavage of transcripts encoding two auxin receptors, tir <dig> and afb <dig>  is necessary for inhibition of lateral root growth under aba treatment and osmotic stress  <cit> . mir168a over-expressing and ago <dig> loss-of-function ago1- <dig> mutant plants display aba hypersensitivity and drought tolerance, whereas mir168a- <dig> mutant plants show aba hyposensitivity and drought hypersensitivity  <cit> . however, conflicting reports exist on mirnas regulation of plant abiotic stress responses. for example, atmir <dig> targets a gene coding for a ubiquitous transcription factor nfya5; over-expression of atmir169a in plants enhanced leaf water loss and more sensitivity to drought stress than wild-type plants  <cit> , whereas sly-mir169c over-expression enhanced drought tolerance by reducing stomatal opening, transpiration rate and leaf desiccation  <cit> . these results suggest that mirnas-regulated plant response to abiotic stresses seems more complex than expected. their biological roles and regulatory networks that coordinate plant response to abiotic stresses are still not fullly understood.

mir <dig> is one of the conserved mirnas that exist in many dicot and monocot plant species; in arabidopsis, only two mir394a and mir394b were found and its target gene  was found to encode an f-box protein   <cit> . recently, we have reported mir <dig> and its target gene lcr are involved in regulation of leaf curling-related morphology  <cit> . over-expression of a mir394-resistant version of lcr under the 35s promoter  results in a curled-down leaf defect. conversely, transgenic plants over-expressing 35s:mir394a/b display a curled-up leaf phenotype. detailed analysis showed evidence that these phenotypes are related to auxin response. furthermore, mir <dig> has been identified as a mobile signal on the surface cell layer  required for enhancing stem cell competence to the distal meristem by repressing lcr  <cit> . interestingly, mir <dig> was also reported to be induced by abiotic stresses in plants  <cit> . these findings prompted us to investigate further whether mir <dig> is able regulate plant responses to salt and drought stresses. the present study provides evidence that mir <dig> is involved in regulation of plant response to salt and drought stresses in arabidopsis in an aba-dependent manner.

RESULTS
expression of mir <dig> under salt and drought stresses and aba treatment
to validate expression of mir <dig> in response to salt and drought stresses, two week-old arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to 300 mm salt , drought  and  <dig> μm aba for  <dig> and 12 h. rna gel-blot analysis showed that mir <dig> was slightly induced by nacl and drought . using rt-pcr, we further analyzed whether expression of mir394a and mir394b was also affected by salt and drought exposure. it is shown that both mir394a and mir394b were induced under saline and drought stresses . to further investigate expression of mir394a/b, its promoter sequences were retrieved, fused to the β-glucuronidase  reporter gene, and introduced into transgenic plants. the histochemical analysis showed that heavy gus staining was detected in pmir394a/b::gus seedlings under salt and drought stresses, whereas the relatively light gus staining was observed in the control seedlings . the phytohormone aba mediates plant response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . examination of mir <dig> response to aba treatment revealed that mir <dig> was mildly induced . similarly, the abundance of both pre-mir394a and pre-mir394b transcripts as well as pmir394a/b::gus staining were also slightly enhanced by aba . feedback loops in which mirna-regulated genes may regulate the transcription of their mirna have been described before  <cit> . our analysis showed that mir <dig> transcripts were not changed in the 35s:mlcr and lcr mutant plants ; also, quantitative real-time pcr showed no significant deference between 35s:mlcr or lcr mutant plants and wild-type , indicating that mir <dig> is not feedback-regulated by lcr.

expression of lcr under salt and drought stresses and aba treatment
although mir <dig> is induced by salt and drought, whether lcr is regulated by aba and the abiotic stresses is unknown. to investigate the expression pattern of lcr, we generated constructs encoding a gus reporter protein and lcr fusion protein under the control of lcr promoter sequence  and transformed into arabidopsis. histochemical staining showed that plcr::gus was active at all development stages . to test the regulation of lcr promoter by abiotic stresses, two week-old seedlings were exposed to nacl, drought and aba. treatments with salt and drought induced higher gus activity in plcr::gus plants compared with the control . to confirm the expression pattern of gus staining under the abiotic stresses, we comparatively analyzed the transcripts of gus in plcr::gus plants and lcr in wild-type using qrt-pcr. as shown in figure 2c,d, the transcript levels of gus and lcr were up-regulated  <dig> and 12 h after nacl and drought treatments. but the gus level was higher than the lcr level. this suggests that lcr mrna was partially silenced by mir <dig> in plants under the stress condition. to investigate whether lcr at a translational level was affected by salt and drought, a western blot study was carried out. using a monoclonal antibody specifically interacting with lcr protein , we showed that the lcr proteins could be also induced by salt and drought treatments . unexpectedly, less gus staining was detected in seedlings with aba treatment . also, both lcr transcript and protein abundance with aba was found to be lower than the control .

identification of 35s::mir <dig>  35s::m5lcr and lcr mutant lines
to identify the role of mir <dig> in the stress responses, we examined the transgenic lines over-expressing mir394a/b  and the cleavage-resistant version   <cit> . the western blotting on lcr proteins was analyzed. the abundance of lcr proteins was lower in 35s::mir394a plants but was higher in 35s::m5lcr plants compared with the wild-type , indicating that mir <dig> affects the abundance of lcr proteins.

the genomic sequence of lcr contains two exons , which are interrupted by an intron towards 5′ end; the cds contains an open reading frame coding for a protein with  <dig> amino acid residues . two independent t-dna insertion lines, lcr- <dig>  and lcr- <dig>  were used. the mutant lcr- <dig> has a t-dna insertion at 5′ utr, whereas lcr- <dig> has an insertion in the intron towards the first exon. the two mutants were verified by diagnostic pcr using lcr gene-specific and t-dna border primers . the lcr- <dig> and lcr- <dig> alleles were confirmed by rt-pcr and western blot, by which the expression of both lcr mrna and proteins were severely suppressed .

mir394a over-expressing and lcr mutant plants display salt sensitivity
plant seeds were placed on the solid ms medium supplemented with 0–150 mm nacl. the seed germination and post-germination growth responded differently to 50–100 mm nacl after  <dig> d treatment . following the treatment with 100 mm nacl, the germination percentages of 35s::mir394a- <dig>  35s::mir394a- <dig>  lcr- <dig> and lcr- <dig> seeds were only 10-20%, whereas those of wild-type were 78%. simultaneously, the cotyledon greening was blocked by  <dig> or 100 mm nacl in 35s::mir394a or lcr plants. under the same condition, the germinating rate of 35s::m5lcr seeds was up to 94%, and the percentage of cotyledon greening in 35s::m5lcr seedlings was higher than that of wild-type . root growth of 35s::mir394a and lcr seedlings was strongly inhibited by 50–100 mm nacl relative to the wild-type, but compared with 35s::mir394a, the root growth of lcr seedlings was more severely inhibited . by contrast, 35s::m5lcr plants had higher tolerance of roots to nacl stress. the root elongation of 35s::m5lcr plants with 150 mm nacl was increased by 30-40% compared with wild type . these results indicate that both lcr mutant and 35s::mir394a plants are hypersensitive, whereas 35s::m5lcr plants are tolerant to the salt stress.

mir394a over-expression and lcr mutant plants display drought tolerance
under the water loss condition, most of wild-type, 35s::mir394a and mutant plants were withered . after a three-day re-watering, 47-56% of 35s::mir394a and 68-71% of the lcr mutant plants resumed their growth, whereas only 26% of the wild-type plants survived . by contrast, the 35s::m5lcr plants were severely wilted after dehydration stress . after re-watering for  <dig> d, there was only 18-23% survival , indicating that the 35s::m5lcr plants are supersensitive to drought stress.

we further examined plant response to drought stress using detached rosette leaves of two week-old seedlings, which were placed on a open-lid petri dish under dim light at room temperature. the reduced fresh weight of leaves was measured over time . leaves from all leaves showed progressive loss of weight . to the end of experiment, the fresh weight for 35s::m5lcr plants was only 58-60% of their starting value, and the fresh weight for 35s::mir394a and lcr mutant plants was 73-78%. the wild-type had an intermediate weight of 67%. from these results it is shown that while 35s::m5lcr plants were hypersensitive to water loss, 35s::mir394a and lcr mutant plants displayed higher tolerance to drought stress.

mir394a and lcr are involved in aba-dependent seed germination and root growth
for 35s::mir394a and lcr plants, seed germination and cotyledon development were severely inhibited by  <dig> -2 μm aba , but seed germination of 35s::m5lcr plants was unaffected by aba  . nevertheless, 81-85% of 35s::m5lcr seedlings were able to develop true green cotyledons in the presence of  <dig>  μm aba, with only 18% of wild-type was presented . a concentration-dependent change was observed, in which the aba-hypersensitive response of 35s::mir394a and lcr plants occurred at  <dig>  μm of aba, and when aba concentrations were up to 1 μm, the cotyledon growth was completely blocked . by contrast, 35-40% of 35s::m5lcr seedling cotyledons were still green and even expanded at 1 μm of aba, where the growth of wild-type was arrested .

consistent with seed germination and cotyledon growth, root elongation of 35s::mir394a and lcr seedlings was hypersensitive to aba . the sensitive concentration occurred at  <dig>  μm, where the root length of 35s::mir394a and lcr was only  <dig> - <dig> % and  <dig> - <dig> % of wild-type, respectively . under the same condition, however, the elongation of 35s::m5lcr root showed more resistance to aba treatment . at  <dig>  and 1 μm of aba, the root length of 35s::m5lcr plants was  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  folds over the wild-type, respectively . we generated transgenic lines over-expressing a modified version of ips <dig> , which encodes a non-coding rna  <cit> . this rna comprises a short motif highly complementary to mir <dig> with a small loop at the expected cleavage position, which can sequester mir <dig>  partially release its natural target, and increase lcr abundance  <cit> . we used target mimicry mir <dig>  transgenic lines to test aba response in plants and found that phenotype of root growth is very similar to that of 35s::m5lcr plants . thus, mir <dig> over-expressing plants were hypersensitive to aba, whereas 35s::m5lcr plants had a converse phenotype with aba.

mir394a and lcr are involved in aba-dependent stomatal closure
leaves of 4 week-old plants were submerged in stomatal opening solution and treated with aba at  <dig>   <dig>  and 10 μm for 2 h. in the absence of aba, all guard cells on leaves of plants were fully opened . when  <dig> and 10 μm aba was added to the solution, the stomata on the leaves of wild-type and 35s::mir394a plants were closed. quantitative analysis using stomatal aperture  showed that there was much stronger stomatal closure in 35s::mir394a plants than in wild-type with 1 μm aba . conversely, the 35s::m5lcr leaves were insensitive to aba-induced stomatal closure and most of guard cells were open in the presence of  <dig> or 10 μm aba. the stomatal apertures were  <dig> -  and  <dig> -  fold over those of wild-type, respectively.

reactive oxygen species  is one of the essential signal molecules involved in abscisic acid -induced stomatal closure  <cit> . leaves of four week-old plants were exposed to  <dig> or 50 μm aba for 2 h and treated with nitroblue tetrazolium  or  <dig> ’-diaminob enzidine . compared with wild-type, leaves of 35s::mir394a plants exposed to 50 μm aba were stained intensively, whereas those of 35s::m5lcr plants were stained light with o2–. and h2o <dig> . these results indicated that aba-induced ros abundance could be altered in 35s::mir394a and 35s::m5lcr plants.

over-expression of mir394a cannot rescue the aba insensitivity of abi4- <dig> and abi5-1
to gain insights into involvement of mir <dig> in aba signaling pathway, abi4- <dig> and abi5- <dig> mutant plants were individually crossed to the 35s::mir394a plants. both aba-insensitive   <dig> and abi <dig> encode the major transcription factors which act as positive regulators of aba response  <cit> . because 35s::mir394a and abi4- <dig> or abi5- <dig> mutant plants display the opposite phenotypes, analysis of the crossed plants can elucidate the relationship between the genes. premir394a were expressed in the abi4-1/35s::mir394a and abi5-1/35s::mir394a plants . examination of the two cross plants revealed that the phenotypes of abi4-1/35s::mir394a and abi5-1/35s::mir394a plants were nearly identical to the phenotype of abi4- <dig> and abi5- <dig> plants, respectively  <cit> . in the presence of  <dig>  or 1 μm aba, both abi4-1/35s::mir394a and abi5-1/35s::mir394a plants showed higher seed germination rates, enhanced cotyledon development, and increased root elongation . these results indicate that over-expression of mir394a in abi4- <dig> or abi5- <dig> background resulted in loss of aba-sensitivity in 35s::mir394a plants. the data suggest that mir394a does not function in parallel to abi <dig> and abi <dig>  but both abi <dig> and abi <dig> may work downstream of mir394a.

expression of aba and stress responsive genes in 35s::mir394a and 35s::m5lcr plants
to investigate whether aba and stress-responsive genes could be regulated by mir <dig> or lcr over-expression, two categories of genes were tested. the first group contained five genes  coding for aba-responsive basic leucine zipper  transcription factors that bind to the aba response element  of their targets and function during the plant development and stress responses  <cit> . after treatment with 100 μm aba for 6 h, all genes were induced in 35s::mir394a plants . however, expression of abi <dig>  abi <dig>  and abi <dig> were down-regulated in 35s::m5lcr plants.

the second group genes rd29a, kin <dig>  and rd <dig> belong to the dre/crt  elements-containing class of stress- and aba-responsive genes  <cit> . another gene p5cs encodes enzyme d1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase involved in proline biosynthesis and aba or abiotic stress responses  <cit> . with a similar pattern as abi <dig> or abi <dig>  all these genes rd29a, kin <dig>  rd <dig>  and p5cs were induced in 35s::mir394a plants. by contrast, expression of rd29a, kin <dig>  rd <dig>  and p5cs was down-regulated in 35s::m5lcr plants although the degree of the gene depression varied differently . these results indicated that mir <dig> over-expression can modify transcription of aba- and stress-responsive genes.

discussion
mir <dig> and lcr are involved in salt and drought stress responses
the present study identified mir <dig> and its target gene lcr involved in salt and drought stress responses in arabidopsis. it is shown that both mir <dig> and lcr are independently regulated by salt and drought stresses. because of the lower level of lcr expression in the presence of mir <dig>  the partial post-transcriptional silencing of lcr should be responsible for the phenotypes of plants under the salt and drought stresses.

our studies show that both mir <dig> and lcr are critical for plant response to salt and drought stresses. whereas 35s:mir394a and lcr mutant plants were hypersensitive to salinity, lcr over-expression conferred the salt tolerance. on the other hand, mir394a over-expressing plants display more tolerance to drought stress than did wild-type, whereas 35s::m5lcr plants were hypersensitive to dehydration. these results indicate that mir <dig> acts as a negative regulator of plant response to salt stress but simultaneously as a positive regulator of plant tolerance to drought stress. the physiological pathway by which mir <dig> and lcr confers or attenuate plant tolerance to the stresses is unknown. recently, several studies have been documented on mirnas or small interfering rnas  regulating plant responses to abiotic stresses  <cit> . mir168a over-expressing and argonaute <dig>  loss-of-function ago1- <dig> mutant plants are salt-hypersensitive and drought-tolerant, whereas mir168a- <dig> mutant plants exhibit the reverse phenotype  <cit> . ago <dig> is a major component of rna-induced silencing complex  necessary for cleavage or translational block of target rnas by loaded mirnas  <cit> . mutations in ago <dig> cause increased accumulation of mirna targets, but as a feedback mechanism, ago <dig> homeostasis itself is controlled by mir <dig>  <cit> . as mir168-regulated ago <dig> mediates a broad spectrum of mirnas that function in the risc, it needs to study which ago1-regulated mirna participates in the plant response to salt and drought stresses. the present study specified the mir <dig> involvement in the plant abiotic stress responses. detailed identification of the correlation between mir <dig> and mir <dig> will uncover the abiotic stress-responsive cascades.

mir394-regulated salt and drought stress responses are dependent on aba
the phytohormone abscisic acid  regulates numerous developmental processes and stress responses in plants. under adverse conditions, aba serves as an endogenous signal molecule to sense the environmental stress. interestingly, several mirnas and mirna biogenesis genes have been shown to be involved in aba-mediated stress responses  <cit> . the present study showed that mir <dig> were also induced by aba treatment, although the induction was limited. to date, only a few reports are available on the genetic connection between mirnas and aba-mediated stress responses. a recent report shows that over-expression of gma-mir394a confers tolerance to drought in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> . although no lcr and aba were mentioned and no relationship between mir394/lcr and aba signal was identified, the result on mir <dig> involved in drought stress response was presented. mir <dig> was induced by exogenous aba during seed germination and in young seedlings; over-expression of mir <dig> rendered plants hyposensitive to aba, whereas over-expression of mir159-resistant myb <dig> and myb <dig> resulted in aba hypersensitivity  <cit> . our study has provided additional evidence that mir <dig> is involved in aba or aba-dependent salt and drought responses in arabidopsis. first, both mir <dig> and pre-mir394a/b, as well as lcr were regulated by aba and salt/drought stresses. second, mir394a-overexpressing plants displayed hypersensitivity to aba in terms of inhibited seed germination, blocked cotyledon development, and shorter root length during the post-germination growth. third, mir394a over-expression intensified the aba-promoted stomatal closure and generation of more ros in the presence of aba compared with wild-type. furthermore, expression of aba-responsive genes such as abi <dig>  abi <dig>  abf <dig> or abf <dig> was more evident in 35s:mir394a plants than in wild-type. in addition, the cross of 35s::mir394a with abi4- <dig> or abi5- <dig> mutant plants cannot rescue aba insensitivity of abi4- <dig> and abi5- <dig>  these results suggest mir394-regulated salt and drought stress responses are possibly dependent on abi <dig> and abi <dig> and involved in the aba response.

recent studies have demonstrated that mirna biogenesis genes are also involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses and aba signaling. hyl <dig> encodes a double-strand rna-binding protein, a key factor in microrna biogenesis  <cit> . mutation of hyl <dig>  resulted in aba hypersensitivity at seed germination stage  <cit>  . furthermore, zhang and co-workers  reported that dcl1- <dig> and hen1- <dig> act as modulators of aba signaling in arabidopsis <cit> . they found that mutation of dcl1- <dig> and hen1- <dig> enhanced the aba sensitivity of seed germination and post-germination growth by inducing aba-responsive genes such as abi <dig>  abi <dig>  abi <dig>  abf <dig>  kin <dig> and rd <dig>  from these results it can be suggested that there may be a common aba-responsive mechanism for the phenotypes presented by dcl1- <dig>  hyl <dig>  hen1- <dig>  ago1- <dig> and 35s::mir494a plants. identification of the cascades responsible for the aba response will help to understand the networks that coordinate plant responses to aba signal.

lcr is a novel negative component of aba signaling
recently, an array of e <dig> proteins belonging to ubiquitin proteasome systems, are shown to actively participate in aba hormone singling  <cit> . as components of e <dig> ubiquitin ligases of the scf  class, the f-box proteins regulate plant development and various abiotic stress responses through proteolysis system  <cit> . several f-box proteins were reported to regulate aba-dependent stress responses  <cit> . koops and co-workers  identified an arabidopsis f-box protein edl <dig> that functions as a positive regulator in aba signal cascades controlling seed germination, root growth, and anthocyanin accumulation under abiotic stresses  <cit> . arabidopsis dor encodes an f-box protein ; the dor null mutation caused hypersensitive aba response of stomatal closing and improved drought tolerance; by contrast, transgenic plants over-expressing dor were more susceptible to drought stress  <cit> , indicating that f-box proteins serve as regulators of plant response to aba-dependent abiotic stresses.

the present study identified the biological function of the f-box protein lcr. we show that lcr involves the aba signaling in arabidopsis under salt and drought stresses. genetic and physiological studies revealed that while lcr knockdown  or knockout  resulted in aba hypersensitivity in plants with regards to the arrest of seed germination and root growth, the lcr over-expressing plants  showed insensitivity to aba. the phenotypes associated with aba-dependent stamatal closure and water loss were also found in 35s::m5lcr plants. additionally, over-expression of lcr depressed expression of several aba-responsive bzip transcription factors such as abi <dig> and abi <dig>  suggesting that manipulation of lcr is able to modify aba response. notably, while mir <dig> expression was up-regulated by aba, lcr was down-regulated by aba treatment . this may be the result that aba signals the inhibition of putative protein degradation through depressing lcr. on the other hand, lcr is simultaneously silenced by mir <dig>  implying that lcr suppression may be necessary under the stress. as lcr is a novel negative regulator of aba signaling which is able to facilitate the degradation of a putative protein, the coordinate regulation of mir <dig> and lcr by aba may be essential for aba or aba-dependent abiotic stress responses. in our previous study, we provided the evidence that mir <dig> and lcr-regulated abnormal curling leaves were related to auxin signal. from the two phenotypes , mir <dig> and lcr seem to cross-talk to auxin and aba. however, concerning a molecular mechanism, only one of them is possibly linked to mir394/lcr. identification of targets for lcr is under the way. further characterization of the putative component will unveil the interplay between mir394/lcr and aba or other phytohormone signal.

CONCLUSIONS
both mir <dig> and lcr transcripts are regulated by salt and drought stresses and aba treatment. the silencing of lcr mrna by mir <dig> is essential to maintain a certain phenotype favorable for the adaptive responses to the abiotic stresses. the contrast phenotypes of aba and abiotic stress responses may be mediated by a functional balance between mir <dig> and lcr in plants. if the balance is perturbed in case of the abiotic stress, an identical phenotype related to the stress response occurs, resulting in either aba sensitive or insensitive response. thus, mir394-regulated lcr abundance may allow plants to fine-tune their responses to aba and abiotic stresses.
