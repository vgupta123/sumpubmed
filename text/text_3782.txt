BACKGROUND
chinese fir  hook), an evergreen conifer belonging to the cupressaceae family, is native to southern china and is also distributed in northern vietnam. because it is fast growing, has desirable wood properties and is high yielding, it has been widely cultivated for over  <dig> years. chinese fir accounts for 20–30% of the total commercial timber production in china  <cit> .

the systematic breeding of chinese fir, begun in the 1960s, including the provenance test, cross-breeding and clonal selection, has achieved remarkable successes. a large number of elite germplasms have been collected, and first, second and third generation seed orchards have been established. however, some biological characteristics inherent in chinese fir, such as long generation time, great tree height, high genetic load and inbreeding depression  <cit> , have seriously hindered progress in the nurturing of new varieties through conventional improved technologies. modern molecular biology presents a novel approach and strategy to accelerate the genetic improvement of chinese fir by molecular breeding programs based on deciphering the molecular genetic basis of target traits. in contrast to the successful application of molecular breeding in crop species, such as rice, corn and cotton, because of the lack of genomic information and genetic tools, similar research in chinese fir still lags behind.

wood formation is an essential but highly complicated biological process derived from plant secondary growth in woody plants. in previous studies, the expression profiles of wood formation have been characterized by est  sequencing and microarry hybridization in poplar  <cit> , eucalyptus  <cit> , pinus  <cit>  and spruce  <cit> . some structural genes and important transcription regulators involved in secondary growth were also identified, such as genes encoding the key enzymes in monolignol and cellulose biosynthetic pathways , r2r3-myb transcription factors and nam/ataf/cuc  family genes . in chinese fir, there were few reports on molecular mechanism of wood formation. for example, several hundreds of ests were obtained through suppression subtractive hybridization , which preferentially expressed in differentiating xylem of chinese fir  <cit> . however, the underlying molecular mechanism of wood formation remains to be elucidated, especially for chinese fir. it is undoubtedly helpful and meaningful to explore transcriptome for further molecular improvement on this non-model plant.

rna-seq, dubbed “a revolutionary tool for transcriptomics”, refers to the use of next generation sequencing platforms to sequence cdna in order to get information about a sample’s rna content  <cit> . thanks to a single-base resolution and deep coverage, rna-seq provides researchers with an efficient way to measure transcriptome data experimentally. this simplifies the identification of transcription start sites, new splicing variants and rare transcripts, and allows allele expression to be monitored  <cit> . furthermore it allows the direct transcriptome analysis of non-model organisms, and has been successfully applied to non-model organisms recently  <cit> .

in the present study, we have used illumina paired-end sequencing technology to characterize the transcriptome of chinese fir. the coverage of the transcriptome, at  <dig>  gigabase pairs , was comprehensive enough to discover the majority of the known wood formation genes. this transcriptome dataset will serve as a publicly available information platform for future gene expression, genomic, and functional genomic studies in chinese fir.

RESULTS
illumina paired-end sequencing and de novo assembly
to comprehensively cover the transcriptome of chinese fir, total rna was extracted from nine different tissues: young leaves, mature leaves, young roots, cones, non-lignified stems, lignifying stems, bark, immature xylem and xylem. using illumina hiseq™  <dig> sequencing technology, a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean reads with an average length of  <dig> bp long were obtained from one plate  of sequencing, generating approximate  <dig>  gigabase pairs  of data. of the clean reads data,  <dig> %  had phred-like quality scores at the q <dig> level . all high-quality reads were assembled de novo using the short reads assembling program soapdenovo  <cit> . this produced  <dig>  contigs  with an average length of  <dig> bp. the length of contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, and  <dig> % of the contigs were more than  <dig> bp long .

the contigs were assembled into scaffolds using paired-end joining. as a result,  <dig>  scaffolds were obtained with an average length of  <dig> bp and including  <dig>  scaffolds longer than  <dig>  bp . although  <dig> % scaffolds had no gaps, roughly  <dig>  bp gaps  remained unclosed . to shorten the remaining gaps further, read pairs that had one end well aligned on the contigs and the other end located in the gap regions were retrieved using the paired-end information, then, a local assembly was done with the collected reads to fill in the small gaps within scaffolds. the gap-filled scaffolds were clustered and assembled to get sequences with least ns and cannot be extended on either end. such unique sequences are defined as unigenes. in this step, a length equivalent to nine-tenths of the gaps was filled, and a total length of only  <dig>  bp gaps  remained unclosed. the distribution of the remaining gaps is shown in additional file  <dig>  overall  <dig>  unigenes were obtained with an average length of  <dig> bp, and a combined length of  <dig>  mb . the lengths of the assembled unigenes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp;  <dig>  unigenes were ≥ <dig> bp and  <dig>  were ≥ <dig>  bp . the length distribution of the unigenes was similar as that of the scaffolds, that is, the majority were the shorter sequences.

to further evaluate the quality of the assembled unigenes, all the high-quality reads that were used in the assembly were realigned to the unigenes using soapaligner  <cit>  allowing up to  <dig> base mismatches. the sequencing depth ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold, with an average of  <dig>  fold. about  <dig> % of the unigenes were supported by more than  <dig> reads,  <dig> % were supported by more than  <dig> reads, and approximate 5% were supported by more than  <dig>  reads . at the same time, sequencing bias was analyzed by detecting the random distribution of reads in the assembled unigenes. although the 5’ and 3’ ends of all the assembled unigenes contained relatively fewer numbers of reads, other positions  of all assembled unigenes showed a greater and more even read distribution . these findings are roughly consistent with the results of previous studies  <cit> , suggesting that the quality of our data is comparable to similar data of other non-model plants. to further assess the transcript coverage and to estimate how the coverage depth affected the assembly of the unigenes, the reciprocal tblastx was performed, and the correlation between the ratios of the assembled unigene lengths to the lengths of spruce orthologs and coverage depth were surveyed using a scatter plot. although many of the chinese fir unigenes failed to cover the complete coding regions of their spruce orthologs, most of coding region of each of the spruce orthologs could be covered by corresponding unigenes . it is worth noting that increased coverage depth can, to some extent, contribute to higher coverage of the coding regions. moreover, in many cases, more than one unigene covered different regions of a spruce ortholog. by plotting the cumulative percent of spruce orthologs covered by all the obtained unigenes we found that only  <dig> of the orthologs were covered by >80%,  <dig>  of the orthologs were covered by 40% to 80%, and around  <dig> % of the orthologs were covered by only 20% or less . these results indicate that additional sequencing is essential for a more comprehensive coverage of the chinese fir transcriptome.

functional annotation based on searches against public databases
database searches
to validate and annotate the assembled unigenes, two levels of sequence similarity searches were conducted using sequence-based and domain-based alignments. the sequence-based alignments were performed against the ncbi non-redundant protein  database, the swiss-prot protein database, and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database  using the blastx algorithm  <cit>  with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  the domain/family searches were conducted against the clusters of orthologous groups  database at ncbi using blastx. the e-value thresholds were also set at 1e- <dig>  of  <dig>  unigenes with mapped reads greater than  <dig>   <dig>   were found against at least one of the searched databases;  <dig>   had significant matches in all four databases. the numbers of best blastx and domain hits for the unigene sequences in each of the databases are summarized in table  <dig> 

annotation of predicted proteins
to assign gene name, coding sequence , and predicted protein annotations to the unigene sequences, first the results of the nr database search were analyzed. we found that  <dig>   unigenes showed significant similarity to known plant proteins and matched  <dig>  unique protein accession numbers . previous reports  <cit>  have indicated that the longer the query sequence the easier it was to find blast matches in the databases. in our analysis, homologous matches were found for  <dig> % of unigenes over  <dig>  bp long, whereas only  <dig> % of unigenes shorter than  <dig> bp found matches . similar results were also obtained for the searches against the other three databases . the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database revealed that  <dig> % of the mapped sequences ranged between le- <dig> and le- <dig>   <dig> % varied from le- <dig> to le- <dig>  and  <dig> %  unigenes had e-values less than le- <dig> . the nr plant protein sequences come from dozens of species; however, we found that  <dig> % of the unigenes had the most similar sequence to proteins from oryza sativa, followed by arabidopsis thaliana , zea mays , picea sitchensis , populus trichocarpa , vitis vinifera  and medicago truncatula  . in addition, the blast alignments against the swiss-prot proteins were performed with these unigenes. as a result,  <dig>   unigenes were matched to  <dig>  unique swiss-prot plant protein accession numbers . when the similarity search results from the two plant protein databases were combined, a total of  <dig>   unigenes could be assigned gene descriptions based on the  <dig>  unique protein accessions that were identified by the blast searches. this result indicates that the illumina paired-end sequencing produced a substantial fraction of the chinese fir genes.

gene expression levels can be represented as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads  in rna-seq  <cit> . the rpkm value of the annotated unigenes varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> . thirty-five annotated unigenes that represented the most abundant transcripts in the chinese fir cdna library had rpkm values of more than  <dig> . these genes were predicted to encode the enzymes involved in photosynthetic metabolism, biotic and abiotic stress responses, such as ribulose- <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ferredoxin-nadp oxidoreductase, germin-like protein and superoxide dismutase. five abundant transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins were also identified. because lignin and cellulose are the two major polymeric components of wood, it is not surprising that  <dig> of the unigenes were annotated as encoding the major enzymes involved in cellulose and lignin biosynthesis, such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate coa ligase, cellulose synthase and sucrose synthase. the rpkm values for these unigenes were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

functional classification by go and cog
to functionally categorize the chinese fir unigenes based on the nr annotation, gene ontology  analysis was conducted. of the  <dig>  unigenes that had blastx matches to the nr plant species dataset,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to go classes with  <dig>  terms using blast2go  <cit> . using the wego software  <cit> , the assigned go terms were summarized into the three main go categories, biological process, molecular function and cellular component, and then into  <dig> sub-categories . cellular component comprised  <dig>   go annotations and was the largest cluster, followed by biological process  and molecular function .

the distribution of the sub-categories in each main category is shown in figure  <dig>  in the cellular component category,  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes were assigned to cell and cell part respectively; they represented the majority of the unigenes in this category. only a few of the unigenes were assigned to extracellular region, extracellular region part, and virion. within the biological process category, metabolic process  and cellular process  were prominent, indicating that these unigenes were involved in some important metabolic activities in chinese fir. interestingly, seven unigenes were assigned to the biological adhesion category and a relatively large number of genes  were annotated as being involved in response to different stimuli. in the molecular function category, catalytic activity  represented the most abundant term, followed by binding , transporter activity  and molecular transducer activity .

to further predict gene function and to evaluate the completeness of the transcriptome library, all the assembled unigenes were searched against the cog database. overall,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned cog classifications . because some of these sequences were assigned multiple cog functions, altogether  <dig>  cog functional annotations were produced. the cog-annotated putative proteins were classified into  <dig> functional categories . the general function prediction only category represented the largest group , followed by transcription , posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones , replication, recombination and repair , translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis , carbohydrate transport and metabolism , signal transduction mechanisms , and amino acid transport and metabolism . only a few unigenes were assigned to extracellular structure and nuclear structure . notably,  <dig>  and  <dig> unigenes were assigned to secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism, and to cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis respectively.

kegg pathway mapping
to understand the biological pathways that might be active in c. lanceolata, the unigenes were compared against the kegg database  <cit> . the results showed that of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   had significant matches and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . among them,  <dig>  unigenes could be mapped to a single enzyme commission  number. the pathways that were most represented were phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , starch and sucrose metabolism , flavonoid biosynthesis , stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis  and phenylalanine metabolism . these annotations will be a valuable resource for further research on specific processes, structures, functions, and pathways in chinese fir.

analysis of metabolic pathway annotated c. lanceolata unigenes
the  <dig>  annotated unigenes are a significant contribution to the expansion of the existing c. lanceolata est libraries. the annotated c. lanceolata metabolic pathway unigenes were analyzed, following a previously published method  <cit> . cellulose and lignin are the main chemical components of the plant cell secondary wall, and are significantly related to wood quality. therefore, we have selected the lignin and cellulose metabolic pathways for further analysis. we started with simple keyword searches in the functional annotations of the unigenes and confirmed each search result with blast searches against other plant protein sequences in the public databases and, if no hits were found, against other plant nucleotide sequences  <cit> .

cellulose biosynthesis in c. lanceolata
cellulose, a linear polymer of glucose residues connected by -β-linkages to a high degree of polymerization , is the most abundant polysaccharide in nature with approximately  <dig> billion tons produced and broken down every year  <cit> . it is also important industrially as a renewable natural resource. cellulose synthesis is currently one of the main areas of study in plant molecular biology; however, despite the considerable progress made during the last decade, the underlying mechanisms of the biosynthesis process have remained obscure. based on previous studies  <cit> , a hypothetical pathway was represented in figure  <dig>  in all,  <dig> unigenes related to six of the enzymes in this pathway were identified in our annotated c. lanceolata transcriptome database . cellulose synthase complex, a key enzyme of cellulose biosynthesis, is composed of a number of catalytic subunits . forty-eight unigene sequences were annotated as encoding cesa subuintis. after removing redundant sequences, we identified  <dig> different cesa related sequences that were more than  <dig> bp long. genome analyses have revealed that arabidopsis and populus trichocarpa contain  <dig> and  <dig> different cesa genes respectively  <cit> . this finding further demonstrates the quality of our sequencing data that will certainly contribute to cellulose biosynthesis research in c. lanceolata. in addition, a membrane-bound endo-β- <dig> -glucanase  has been proposed to play an important role in the subsequent assembling of microfibrils  <cit> . in total,  <dig> unigene sequences encoding kor were identified in our transcriptome data set.

lignin biosynthesis in c. lanceolata
after cellulose, lignin is the second most abundant biopolymer in nature. lignin contributes up to 15% to 35% of the dry weight of wood  <cit> . in wood, it is polymerized from three monolignols: the p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols. these monolignols, when incorporated into the lignin polymer, are called the guaiacyl , syringyl , and p-hydroxyphenyl  units. lignins from the gymnosperms are composed mostly of g-units , whereas the angiosperm dicot lignins are composed of g- and s-units. although researchers have studied lignin for more than a century, many aspects of its biosynthesis remain a matter of debate. the currently accepted biosynthetic pathway in conifers is shown in figure  <dig> <cit> . unigenes that were annotated as being involved in this pathway are listed in additional file  <dig>  overall  <dig> unigenes were identified, which related to six of the enzymes in the general phenylpropanoid pathway. and  <dig> unigenes were annotated as two enzymes involving in the monolignol-specific pathway . the numbers of unigenes annotated as these eight enzymes varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  additionally, caffeic acid o-methyltransferase , which catalyzes the formation of ferulic acid from caffeic acid in gymnosperms, is now believed to be required only for s- and not for g- or h-lignin formation. in total,  <dig> sequences encoding comt were found in our transcriptome data set.

furthermore, two unigenes for the lignin-related r2r <dig> transcription factor, myb <dig> and myb <dig> were found. myb <dig> and myb <dig> are members of a myb transcription factor family that may regulate transcription from cis-acting ac elements of genes in the phenylpropanoid and monolignol-specific pathways  <cit> .

gene validation and expression analysis
based on the transcriptome sequencing and annotation, the full-length cdna sequences of the  <dig> putative c. lanceolata genes that were identified as being related to cellulose and lignin synthesis, namely cesa <dig> and cesa <dig>  pal <dig>  pal <dig> and clpal <dig>  c4h, 4cl, c3h, ccoaomt <dig> and ccoaomt <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  cad <dig> and cad <dig>  comt and myb <dig> and myb <dig>  were isolated by race and rt-pcr. their sequences were submitted to the nucleotide sequence database . the lengths of these genes varied from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp . when the corresponding unigenes were aligned against these sanger-sequenced, full-length cdna sequences, a total of  <dig> unigenes were found to cover different regions of the subject genes respectively . whether to cover the same subject genes, these unigenes could be divided into  <dig> groups. overall, nine unigene groups covered more than 80% of the corresponding full-length genes and six of them were predicted to contain the complete orf. it is noteworthy that two unigene groups showed 100% similarity with the corresponding full-length gene, only one unigene to full-length sequence pair exhibited less than 98% pairwise identity. these results indicated that the unigenes obtained by rna-seq were successfully assembled, and were consistent with the newly sequenced sanger reference sequences.

in the rt-pcr analysis, a single band corresponding to the expected product size was amplified for each of the selected genes . the qrt-pcr analysis was used to compare the relative transcript levels of the unigenes in four different c. lanceolata tissues. the results showed that the two cesa subunits exhibited different expression pattern in the four tissues. the expression levels of cesa <dig> went from high to low from xylem > lignifying stem > bark > non-lignified stem, whereas there was no significant difference in the expression levels of cesa <dig> in the four tissues. in the phenylpropanoid pathway, the chinese fir homologs of pal <dig>  pal <dig>  c3h, ccoaomt <dig>  ccoaomt <dig> and comt showed similar expression patterns in the four tissues. the expression levels went from high to low from xylem > lignifying stem > bark > non-lignified stem; a reverse trend occurred for the homolog of 4cl . the expression level of pal <dig> was much higher in bark than in the other tissues; its lowest expression level was in the xylem. in contrast, the expression level of c4h was low in bark and high in xylem. in the monolignol-specific pathway, the expression patterns of ccr <dig>  cad <dig> and cad <dig> were the same as those described for cesa <dig> and pal <dig> and the other genes in that group. the expression level of ccr <dig> in bark was  <dig>  times higher than in the lignifying stem, and  <dig>  times higher than in the non-lignified stem and xylem. additionally, the two putative myb transcription factors that may regulate the transcription of the genes identified as being related to lignin biosynthesis, exhibited the same expression pattern . on the whole, the expression results from the qrt-pcr analysis matched the putative functions assigned to these unigenes.

discussion
wood is an important raw material with rapidly increasing worldwide demand and, as a result, plant biologists have been paying more attention to understanding the genetic regulation of wood formation. transcriptome sequencing is an important tool that is increasingly being used to discover the genes that control economic traits. although traditional est sequencing methods, such as sanger sequencing, have made significant contributions to functional genomics research, the method is costly, time-consuming, and sensitive to cloning biases. because of the potential for high throughput, accuracy and low cost, next-generation sequencing  is now being widely applied to analyze transcriptomes qualitatively and quantitatively. in this study, the de novo transcriptome sequencing analysis of chinese fir was conducted using the illumina platform. as a result, approximately  <dig>  million paired-end reads were obtained, generating  <dig>  gbp of sequence data. the large number of reads and associated paired-end information that were produced resulted in a relatively high coverage depth . when these sequences were assembled, we obtained longer unigenes  than has been reported previously in studies using the same technology; for example, camellia sinensis   <cit> , lycoris sprengeri   <cit> , porphyra yezoensis   <cit>  and whitefly   <cit> . the number of assembled unigenes was 112-fold more than all the chinese fir sequences that were currently deposited in genbank .

all the chinese fir unigenes that were remapped by at least  <dig> reads were subjected to blastx analysis against four public databases. a total of  <dig> %  unigenes had homologs in the nr and swiss-prot databases, whereas in camellia sinensis  <cit> , lycoris sprengeri <cit> , porphyra yezoensis <cit>  and whitefly  <cit> , only  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % unigenes, respectively, had homologs in the nr database. the higher percentage of matches that we found in our study was partly because of longer unigenes in our database. the remaining  <dig> %  of the unigenes did not match any of the known genes. specifically,  <dig> % of sequences between 150– <dig> bp,  <dig> % between 201– <dig> bp, and  <dig> % longer than  <dig>  bp, had no blast matches against the nr protein database, implying that blast hits were more likely to be found for longer query sequences. the shorter sequences might either lack a characterized protein domain or be too short to find statistically meaningful matches. however, some of sequences that had no blast hits might represent potential chinese-fir-specific genes. in addition,  <dig>  unique protein accession numbers were identified by the blast searches. if the number of chinese fir genes is assumed to be commensurate with that of populus trichocarpa , which has been annotated as having  <dig>  genes  <cit> , then our annotated unigenes represent  <dig> % of the number of black cottonwood genes. of the annotated chinese fir unigenes,  <dig>  were assigned to go terms and  <dig>  were given cog classifications. in addition,  <dig>  unigenes were mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways. these results indicated that our illumina paired-end sequencing project yielded a substantial fraction of genes from chinese fir.

cellulose and lignin are two important biopolymers that account for most of the dry weight in wood. for additional analyses of our transcriptome unigenes, we focused on the genes involved in their biosynthesis. according to the currently accepted cellulose and lignin metabolic pathways, almost all genes required to encode the related enzymes were found in our transcriptome data set . many of the genes involved in these pathways appear to be from multigene families, which is consistent with related reports of arabidopsis and poplar  <cit> . chinese fir is a diploid organism with a large genome, so it is possible that the chinese fir genome might have gone through extensive re-arrangement during its evolution. except for three of the enzymes , none of the others have been previously reported in this species. we discovered two r2r3-myb transcription factors that might regulate lignification in our transcriptome data set. to validate our assembly and annotation, we selected  <dig> genes that were annotated to enzymes related to cellulose and lignin biosynthesis. overall  <dig> unigenes were found to align to these genes. these unigenes covered different regions of the corresponding full-length genes. this result implied that the unigenes obtained from the transcriptome sequencing were consistent with the results of the sanger sequencing. furthermore, each target gene generated the expected product band size by rt-pcr, and the results of the qrt-pcr analysis confirmed their putative functions. thus, we have shown that the transcriptome dataset is a valuable addition to the publicly available chinese fir genomic information.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we employed rna-seq to analyze the transcriptome of chinese fir at an unprecedented depth  and produced  <dig>  assembled unigenes, 112-fold more than all the chinese fir sequences deposited in genbank . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were supported by more than  <dig> reads,  <dig> % were found to have homologs in the public databases. the annotated unigenes were functionally classified based on their matches in the go, cog and kegg databases. this study demonstrated that the illumina paired-end sequencing technology is a fast and cost-effective method for novel gene discovery in non-model plant organisms. in addition, the chinese fir unigenes provided a comprehensive enough coverage to allow the discovery of almost all the genes known to be involved in cellulose and lignin biosynthesis. we believe that this transcriptome dataset will serve as an important public information platform to improve the understanding of molecular mechanism of wood formation in chinese fir.
