BACKGROUND
the emergence of e. faecalis and e. faecium as leading hospital pathogens worldwide has been associated with their promiscuous nature in acquiring new genetic elements through hgt. hgt facilitates the adaptation of specific genetic lineages to the hospital environment by enabling acquisition of antimicrobial resistance, bacteriocin and virulence determinants that provide selective advantages and promote gastrointestinal colonization  <cit> . molecular epidemiological studies using multi-locus sequence typing  and eburst analysis identified a worldwide polyclonal cluster of hospital adapted e. faecium clones, termed at that time clonal complex   <dig>  which contained sequence type   <dig> as well as its possible descendants; single locus variants st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  <cit> . however, recent bayesian-based population genetic modelling comparing whole genome sequences, suggests the existence of two clades of e. faecium strains , where clade a  includes e. faecium associated with human infections from cc <dig> as opposed to clade b that contains strains of non-hospital human origin  <cit> . e. faecalis, in general, seem to be less origin- and/or host-restricted as dominant clones are shared between hospitals and the community although some ccs, including cc <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig> show clear over-representation in hospital-associated infections  <cit> .

whole genome sequencing, comparative genome analysis and molecular epidemiological studies have provided important information about the content and distribution of mges in e. faecalis and e. faecium  <cit> . plasmids, transposons, and prophages all contribute to the plasticity of enterococcal genomes  <cit>  and clinical e. faecium strains have twice as many genes associated with mges as compared to non-clinical strains  <cit> . sequence variability, presence of mosaic structures of plasmids combining modules from various origin and chimeric plasmids indicates a high genetic diversity of enterococcal plasmids  <cit> . further, plasmid-mediated intraspecies chromosome-to-chromosome transfer of large dna segments has been documented for both e. faecalis  <cit>  and e. faecium  <cit> . in hospital-associated enterococci, plasmid stabilizing toxin-antitoxin  systems, including axe-txe and ω-ε-ζ, are prevalent  <cit> . notably, such ta-systems are increasingly considered as targets for development of new antimicrobial agents against multidrug resistant pathogens  <cit> . the impact of prophages on enterococcal diversity is less understood, but whole genome sequencing of e. faecium strains identified prophages as a prominent source of genome diversity  <cit> .

our epidemiological knowledge of mges in enterococci is limited and have mainly been based on the characterization of a restricted number of strains. the population structure of the examined strains have not been well characterized and their selection has been from a very broad range of origins and/or biased by certain characteristics such as specific antibiotic resistance mechanisms. thus, we still have a considerable gap in our knowledge concerning the presence and relative distribution of known mges in different clinically relevant genetic lineages of enterococci and the potential role of these mges in the ecological dominance of enterococcal lineages in hospitals. in order to provide new insight in the complex mobile gene pool of e. faecalis and e. faecium , we developed a dna microarray with markers of enterococcal mobile genetic elements  and crispr-cas elements identified so far. the arrays were hybridized with single strain genomic dna of  <dig> enterococcal hospital associated strains. the mobilome profiles distinguished enterococci at species and subspecies level. the observed homogeneous hybridization pattern between e. faecium sts is in accordance with an evolutionary relatedness of st <dig> and st <dig>  <cit> .

dna isolation, hybridization and data acquisition
single strain genomic dna for microarray hybridization and pcr was extracted using e.z.n.a bacterial dna kit  with the following modifications: cell walls were digested with 7 μg/μl lysozyme and  <dig>  u/μl mutanolysin for 20 min at 30°c, and dna was eluted with ddh2o. for hybridization, dna was broken down to 100–600 bp fragments by 1 min sonication at 2 μm amplitude. genomic dna  was fluorescent labeled using the kreatech labeling kit with uls-cy <dig> according to the manufacturer’s instructions , and degree of labeling  was calculated by measuring absorbance at  <dig> and 650 nm using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. hybridization of 4x2k customarrays were performed as described by the manufacturer  at 52°c for 15 hours. slides were subsequently scanned using an axon genepix ® 4000b scanner. immediately after scanning, the slides were stripped for 90 min according to the manufacturer’s protocol. control scans were performed each time to monitor possible background of the subsequent re-hybridization. the slides were stripped up to  <dig> times.

data analysis
e. faecalis v <dig>  <cit>  was used as a technical replicate control on each fourplex array. specifically, given that both the e. faecalis v <dig> genome and array probe sequences are known, number of false positive hybridizations could be monitored. a signal intensity cut-off could therefore be determined for each array, which reduces these hybridizations with more than 95%. the entire dataset was then normalized using quantile normalization. the overall correlation for all technical replicates included in study was  <dig> , . a hierarchical cluster diagram of hybridization data made in r calculated the distance by the method “complete”. principal component analyses  and a cluster dendrogram were run on the resultant quantile normalized matrix . the presence or absence of each target in each of the  <dig> clinical e. faecium st <dig>  and st <dig>  and e. faecalis st <dig>  and st <dig>  is presented in additional file 3: figure s2a-e. each target is represented as a mean value of its 1– <dig> probes. number of probes and probe sequences are listed in additional file 4: table s <dig> 

probe design and final target list
the bioinformatics analysis and probe design of initially  <dig> targets sequences was done by customarray support  . a total of  <dig> targets were excluded due to sequence similarity , sequence quality, and misleading annotation in genbank. for the remaining  <dig> target sequences, 1– <dig> probes were designed. suggested probes were blasted against a database built of the following enterocccal genome sequences: , e. faecium strains e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , and u <dig> , and the e. faecalis strains og1rf , tx <dig> , and tx <dig> . probes with most homologues  were excluded. the resulting  <dig> probes were tm-balanced by altering their length between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides. number of final probes for each target and probes sequences are given in additional file 4: table s <dig> 

the final target list included plasmid backbone genes  encoding replication initiation proteins, genes associated with plasmid conjugation maintenance and plasmid addiction systems; transposable elements  including conjugative transposons , tn <dig> family of transposons , transposases associated to known is elements, and other targets associated to transposable elements; genes encoding resistance  towards relevant antibiotics , linezolid, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim), biocides , and heavy metals; prophage sequences  and crispr-cas sequences . thirty six plasmid replicon variants associated with enterococci were included in the analyses. previously defined  <dig> reps  <cit>  are designated by subscripted number representing replicon type and/or the name of the reference plasmid in additional file 5: figure s3a.

pcr
the presence of important targets rejected during the probe design or targets representing newly described mobile genetic elements were examined by specific pcrs. they included aac-aph-ia encoding the bi-functional aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme  <cit> , the vana and vanb clusters  <cit>  as well as genes encoding the replication initiation proteins of plasmids plg <dig>  <cit> , pcf <dig>  <cit>  and pip <dig>   <cit> . to detect both ω-ε-ζ phylogenetic subgroups  <cit> , the following primer pair specific for conserved regions were used: eu2f: 5′-ggcggaaacgtaaaagaagttatg-3′ and eu4r: 5′-ttcattgaccgccaatactcatg-3′.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing
antimicrobial susceptibility testing  of the strains was performed to examine the validity of the microarray hybridization results for defining antimicrobial resistance determinants. ast towards ampicillin , erythromycin , gentamicin , linezolid , and tetracycline  were done according to eucast  disk diffusion method  <cit> . vancomycin susceptibility was examined using the brain heart infusion  agar screen method  <cit>  using bhi supplemented with  <dig> mg/l vancomycin. the eucast clinical breakpoints  <cit>  or clinical breakpoints defined by clinical and laboratory standards institute  for antimicrobials not defined by the eucast were used for interpretation of ast.

statistical calculations
the statistical differences in hybridization profile of selected targets between either the two species  or between sts within the two species  were assessed by chi square  calculations without corrections and with  <dig> degree of freedom using the online calculator http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/contingency1/ . p-value < <dig>  was considered significant.

RESULTS
clinical relevant strains of european origin belonging to four predominant sts from the two decades of  <dig> and  <dig> were chosen for this study; e. faecium st <dig> and st <dig> which represent bayesian analysis of population structure  groups 3– <dig> and 2– <dig> and e. faecalis st <dig> and st <dig> of cc <dig> and cc <dig>  respectively. the dna microarray was designed to cover mobile genetic elements  and crispr-cas elements associated with enterococci and known at that time.

overall hybridization profile and quality
a pca was applied on the overall dataset and visualized in a two-dimensional plot , also a dendrogram was created to visualize the result of a hierarchical clustering calculation of the mobilome . the overall hybridization pattern showed e. faecium st <dig> and st <dig> clustered while the e. faecalis st <dig> and st <dig> formed two valid subgroups. as these data covers genes mainly involved in hgt and to a much less extent vertical descent, this does not describe the clonal relatedness of the strains analyzed. mlst-based data show that e. faecium st <dig> and st <dig> belong to two different baps groups  suggesting that both sts are part of different hospital lineages and followed different evolutionary trajectories  <cit> . although analyzing different strains than ours, the phylogenetic distance between e. faecium st <dig> and st <dig> is partly addressed through wgs by lebreton et al. showing these strains grouped in one clade   <cit> . within this clade, however, st <dig> and st <dig> cluster in different lineages, suggesting a certain degree of common evolutionary background yet diversification into separate genetic lineages. the highly-common mobilome found in our e. faecium st <dig> and st <dig> strains is most likely the result of sharing a common ecological niche  in which a common set of accessory genes is necessary to survive and thrive rather than evolutionary relatedness. complete relatedness can be inferred by next generation sequencing , however, this is not the scope of our study. the dna microarray technique was preferred over ngs as we searched only for absence or presence and not localization of specific targets. also, reliable de novo whole genome assemblies from illumina data addressing the mobile genome content is limited  <cit> . the dots representing every application of the control strain, e. faecalis v <dig>  form a tight cluster ensuring the comparable quality of the slides. the pca shows that the selected targets in this array are both species- and st-specific. thus, the overall results of the pca indicate that the dataset is technically accurate and biologically relevant. the accuracy of each repeat of the hybridization was also monitored by correlating the overall hybridizations of the technical replicate e. faecium v <dig> included in each fourplex array . a correlation of  <dig>  was obtained. as an additional quality control of the array, the presence and absence of antimicrobial resistance markers were compared with antimicrobial susceptibility testing and by selected consensus pcr analyses. this revealed that the results from the verifications were in agreement with the microarray hybridization results close to the expected 95% accuracy .

species- and st-specific patterns of mobile genetic elements
the detailed mge gene profile of the  <dig> sample strains is given in additional file 3: figure s2a-e. the data are summarized for each of the four sts in additional file 5: figure s3a-e, significant differences  between species and sts are indicated. the major species and st-specific patterns are categorized and discussed below in relation to difference in content of plasmids, transposable elements, antimicrobial resistance determinants, prophages and crispr-cas modules.

frequently detected plasmid associated gene targets
plasmid-encoded genes involved in conjugation and mobilization as well as replication and maintenance were assessed by microarray hybridization analyses or, for a few targets, by pcr . in order to sort out biological relevant patterns within the complexity caused by the modular structure of plasmids and the propensity of inter-plasmid recombination events, we defined the plasmid content in the four sts by presence of rep genes encoding replication initiator proteins and ta-encoding genes.

the average number of detected reps per strain for e. faecium and e. faecalis  were higher than previously reported for invasive e. faecium  and for clinical isolates of e. faecalis . this might reflect higher plasmid content in the selected sts, but may also be due to the higher number of rep targets included in the array. we suppose the factual number of plasmids to be lower than the identified rep genes since multi replicon plasmids and plasmid remnants in the core chromosome are known for many bacteria including enterococci  <cit> .

as shown in additional file 5: figure s3a, rep targets belonging to the rcr, rep_ <dig>  repa_n, and inc <dig> plasmid families  were well represented in both e. faecium  and e. faecalis . with the exception of the rep_ <dig> family , there were no significant differences between the species or between the sts for the included strains. however, the composition of replicon types  within each plasmid family differed highly between e. faecium and e. faecalis and for some rep types between the sts as indicated. our findings are in accordance with previous reports, although the composition and prevalence of the reps appear to vary between strain collections of different origins  <cit> .

the rep <dig> belonging to the rcr family was the most abundant replicon type in the strain collection with a significant  higher prevalence in e. faecium  than in e. faecalis . the rep <dig> replicons, which include the small mobilizable plasmids pefnp <dig>  pkq <dig> and pri <dig>  have been considered specific for e. faecium  <cit> . sequences originating from pefnp <dig> and pkq <dig> were prominent in a hospital clade specific e. faecium plasmid library  <cit> . interestingly, the rep of pefnp <dig>  was also found in half of the e. faecalis st <dig> strains included in our study. plasmids of rep7/pusa <dig> type have been obtained from a broad range of hosts  and were represented in the array  by a repd of an e. casseliflavus plasmid  <cit> . strikingly, the rep <dig> replicons were found in 12/ <dig> of the e. faecalis strains, but only in two e. faecium strains . taken together, the replicons of the rcr family appear to be abundant with a species-specific profile. nevertheless, our observations support the notion that the examined sts of e. faecium and e. faecalis could share a pool of cryptic small plasmids through hgt. their potential role of in the evolution of clinically important lineages of enterococci remains to be examined.

rep_ <dig> family includes several plasmids previously described in enterococci  <cit> . in our strain collection, a significant higher prevalence of rep_ <dig> family replicons were detected in e. faecium  compared to e. faecalis . in e. faecium represented by rep <dig> , rep <dig>  and reppciz <dig> , the two latter have a higher prevalence in st <dig> compared to st <dig> . in e. faecalis, rep_ <dig> plasmids were represented by rep5/pn <dig> , rep6/ps <dig>  and rep11/pb <dig> . this highly species-specific distribution of replicons indicate a narrow host range profile of the rep_ <dig> family. their high abundance in the e. faecium strains compared to e. faecalis, might reflect a specific role of this plasmid family in the development of these important clinical lineages of e. faecium.

repa_n is the most prevalent plasmid family, but with significant differences in rep types between the two species for the included strains. this is in accordance with the description of repa_n replicons as narrow host range plasmids  <cit> . the rep <dig> variants of pheromone responsive plasmids  <cit>  considered specific for e. faecalis were frequently detected in these strains but were absent in the e. faecium strains . positive pcr results for prgw of pcf <dig> were observed in all e. faecalis st <dig> strains. the par genes, encoding toxin rnai and antitoxin rnaii originally found on the pheromone responsive plasmid pad <dig> in e. faecalis  <cit> , were found in 10/ <dig> of the e. faecalis strains, were also absent in the e. faecium strains . on the other hand, the rep17/prum and rep20/plg <dig> replicons were present in 18/ <dig> and 14/ <dig> of the e. faecium strains, respectively, but absent in e. faecalis . rep17/prum was the single most dominating replicon type among the selected e. faecium strains. this is consistent with previous reports, which also link the axe-txe ta-loci to this replicon type  <cit> . both the axe and the txe targets  hybridized to 15/ <dig> e. faecium strains, while none of the e. faecalis strains were positive . moreover, co-hybridization with the axe-target was observed for 17/ <dig> of the rep17/prum positive and 12/ <dig> rep20/plg <dig> positive  e. faecium strains. also for rep20/plg <dig>  our findings are in agreement with previous investigations, where this rep was detected in 90% of e. faecium blood culture isolates  <cit>  and linked to axe-txe on large conjugative plasmids encoding high-level gentamicin resistance  <cit>  or glycopeptide resistance  <cit> . our confirmatory findings support the importance of rep20/plg <dig> megaplasmids in the evolution of hospital-associated lineages of e. faecium. moreover, the contribution of axe-txe for the stable maintenance of clinical important repa_n family plasmids in e. faecium is underlined.

the broad host range inc <dig> family of conjugative plasmids is known to carry multiple antimicrobial resistance genes, including specific mlsb-resistance determinants hosted by streptococci, lactococci, staphylococci, and enterococci  <cit> . the pre <dig> replicon type  had the same prevalence in e. faecium and e. faecalis , while rep <dig>  which includes reps from pamβ <dig> and pip <dig>  was detected in 6/ <dig> and 7/ <dig> of the e. faecium and e. faecalis strains, respectively. no significant interspecies-differences in distribution of rep types between the included species or sts was detected, except for repphtβ , which had a higher presence in st <dig> , which underlines the broad host range of the inc <dig> plasmid family and their propensity to support genetic exchange between the two species. however, inc <dig> plasmids may have been established in enterococci at an early stage and essentially propagated by vertical descent.

the ω-ε-ζ ta-sequences included in the array originated from the inc <dig> pvef plasmids  <cit> . a discrepancy in presence between the three targeted ta-genes, which can be partly explained by allelic variation in the operon  <cit>  or presence of the targets in other genetic contexts, was observed. however, to function as a plasmid stabilizing system, the presence of all three gene products is essential  <cit> . an additional pcr analysis using primers directed towards regions conserved for the two ω-ε-ζ phylogenetic subgroups  <cit>  detected the ta-locus in a total of 14/ <dig> of e. faecium and 17/ <dig> of e. faecalis, where all st <dig> strains were positive. in agreement with previous findings  <cit> , co-hybridization to rep2/pre <dig> was observed for e. faecium  and for e. faecalis st <dig> , confirming the linkage of ω-ε-ζ to inc <dig> plasmids in gram-positive pathogens and their contribution in stable persistence of clinically important plasmid encoded resistance traits . however, ω-ε-ζ was also detected in the absence of rep2/pre <dig> in both e. faecium  and e. faecalis  indicating linkage to other replicon types as well. indeed, co-localization with rep <dig> belonging to the repa_n family of pheromone responsive plasmids was reported for e. faecalis  <cit> .

the mazef originally observed on the escherichia coli chromosome is one of the best-characterized ta-systems and have been identified in a large number of bacterial species  <cit> . for enterococcus, the e. coli mazef sequence has been reported to be ubiquitously present on vana-plasmids in vre strains including e. faecium and e. faecalis  <cit> . however, the e. coli mazef could not be detected in an epidemiologically diverse collection of e. faecium strains  <cit>  and blast search  among draft genomes and plasmids did not show its presence in enterococcus. in the current study the sequences from e. faecalis engen <dig> strain hh <dig>  annotated as putative maze and mazf were included . all e. faecalis strains  were positive for both targets, while the mazef targets were not found in the e. faecium strains . blast search  for the mazef target dna revealed a high prevalence in e. faecalis genomes where it appeared to be highly conserved, while no dna homology was found in the e. faecium genomes, which is in accordance with our findings. however, conserved orfs encoding putative mazf homologues were prevalent among the e. faecium draft genomes, indicating evolutional segregation of the two species. the functionality and linkage of these mazef genes to the mobilome of enterococcus need to be further investigated.

widely distributed transposable elements
in addition to plasmids, three groups of transposons have been shown to facilitate flux of antimicrobial resistance determinants in enterococci  <cit> . composite transposons transpose accessory dna due to homologous flanking is elements. moreover, the tn <dig> family of transposons encode replicative transposition, and conjugative transposons support their own transfer between bacteria  <cit> . our mobilome array included relevant members from all these three groups previously shown to be associated with enterococci. the is elements belonged to families described by clewell  <cit>  and is finder  .

different transposable elements in e. faecalis and e. faecium
a total of  <dig> is families and  <dig> transposon groups were represented in our array. additional file 3: figure s2b shows the gene profile of all targets included in the microarray, which represents in many cases sequences of several transposases of the same is family. representative targets and their distribution are summarized in additional file 5: figure s3b, illustrating the predominance of transposable elements in e. faecium investigated clones . however, most of the selected targets represented transposable elements from this species and thus the relative overrepresentation of these targets among e. faecium is not unexpected. in particular, transposases of the is families is <dig> , is <dig> , isl <dig> , is200/is <dig> , is <dig> , is <dig> , and is <dig>  were significantly more abundant in e. faecium than e. faecalis. none of the included is families were found at higher frequencies in e. faecalis strains than in the e. faecium strains although  <dig> of the  <dig> is families represented in e. faecium were also found in e. faecalis. the presence of is families in both e. faecalis and e. faecium specific strains imply that these elements are spread by hgt. however, particular is elements are distributed in only one species suggesting that these is elements have evolved over time within this species to become different from the other is family members. many variants of the tn <dig> family conjugative transposons have been reported  and blast searches  show that both the original tn <dig> and most of the variant transposons are reported in e. faecalis. for both reasons it is plausible that the conjugative transposon tn916/tn <dig> was observed more frequently in the investigated strains of e. faecalis  than e. faecium . furthermore, tn <dig> have also been associated with pheromone responsive plasmids in e. faecalis  <cit> , which accelerates their transfer among e. faecalis.

abundant is families and their possible association with resistance genes and transposons
the is <dig> family members  are important components of many composite transposons conferring antimicrobial resistance such as tn <dig> and tn <dig> encoding hlgr  <cit> , tn <dig>  and tn <dig>   <cit> ) and conjugative transposons   <cit> . with the exception of is <dig> and is <dig>  the is <dig> family members in this study are found in the majority of the e. faecium strains  and in 7/ <dig> to 20/ <dig> e. faecalis strains. the presence of isef <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig>   <cit> , which is often observed among tn <dig> variants does not correlate with the presence of this transposons .

a study of e. faecium strains from different niches using comparative genomic hybridization  indicated an is-driven diversification of hospital-adapted e. faecium strains  <cit> . notably, is <dig> was suggested as the most hospital clade-specific marker in e. faecium . this observation was further supported by detecting is <dig> in  <dig> of  <dig> invasive e. faecium strains, in contrast to only three positive for this elements among  <dig> e. faecium strains of human commensal, animal or food-associated origin  <cit> . all our clinical e. faecium strains were positive for is <dig>  while only three e. faecalis strains contained this sequence.

the is <dig> family was represented in this array by isenfa <dig>  is <dig>  is3-like, and is <dig> transposases. is <dig>  which is mostly reported in lactococci, was found in 17/ <dig> e. faecium strains and 12/ <dig> e. faecalis strains. is <dig>  which is widely spread in many enterococcal species  <cit> , were found in all tested strains. the putative transposase of isenfa <dig> was found in all e. faecium, while it was absent in e. faecalis . isenfa <dig> was described as an epidemiological marker for tn <dig> in south korean e. faecium  <cit> . however, only three st <dig> e. faecium strains were positive for tn <dig>  thus isenfa3-like elements do not seem to be associated with tn <dig> in our strains.

the isl <dig> family represented by transposases from isl <dig>  isl3-like, is <dig>  isefa <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> dominated in the e. faecium strains with the exception of two isl3-like transposons . the presence of is <dig>  isefa <dig> and is <dig> transposase sequences which were reported integrated in tn1546-like elements  <cit>  did not correlate with presence of tn <dig> .

the abundance of the is200/is <dig> family in e. faecium was due to isefa <dig> and an e. faecium do is <dig> transposase, while an is <dig> transposase from e. faecalis v <dig> was only found in e. faecalis . a putative isenfa <dig> transposase described previously as being integrated in the vanb cluster of tn <dig>  <cit>  was not found in any of these strains. isefa <dig> was found in a vans gene of a vand genotype vre strain  <cit>  as well as within a tn <dig> element  <cit> . however, in our strains isefa <dig> presence did not correlate with the presence of tn <dig> .

the is <dig> family represented by three transposases was also significantly more abundant in e. faecalis st <dig> than st <dig> strains . this was due to the presence of is <dig> target  <dig> transposase in st <dig> while is <dig> target  <dig> transposase dominated in e. faecium . the third transposase representing the putative isenfa <dig> described previously integrated in tn <dig>  <cit>  was not found in any of these strains.

isefm <dig> representing the is <dig> family has only been reported in a vand operon of a vancomycin resistant e. faecium strain  <cit> . this is element was present in all the e. faecium isolates and was also significantly more frequent in e. faecalis st <dig> than st <dig> strains  .

the is <dig> transposase can be found in many enterococcal genomes, mostly in e. faecium, this is in accordance with our results, where it was found in 6/ <dig> e. faecium strains only.

the is <dig> family represented by is <dig> transposase is more numerous in e. faecalis st <dig> than st <dig> strains  and is also present in 7/ <dig> e. faecium strains . this is element delimits the streptococcal composite transposon tn <dig> carrying resistance to aminoglycoside-streptothricin   <cit> . in multiple-resistant e. faecium tn5405-variants were also found genetically linked to the mlsb determinant ermb and in one case also to the glycopeptide resistance cluster vana  <cit> . in concordance with this, is <dig> was in this study observed to be present only in strains containing sat <dig>  apha-3/aph-iiia and ermb/erm <dig> . however, these resistance genes were observed also in strains lacking is <dig> .

due to is <dig>  the is <dig> family also represented by an isecp1-like transposase, was statistically more prevalent in st <dig> than st <dig> e. faecium  . is <dig> has previously only been reported twice integrated in tn <dig>  <cit>  and close to tn <dig> on a rep17/prum replicon  <cit>  in e. faecium. these is <dig> elements were, except for two strains, not associated with tn <dig> containing strains and detected in only 7/ <dig> e. faecium strains containing the rep17/prum replicon in our study.

predominant transposable elements encoding clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance
to visualize the impact of resistance markers on the overall dataset, a second pca excluding data from the targets encoding resistance markers was built . this did not alter the overall plot substantially suggesting the resistance markers to be generally genetically linked to the other included mges.

the tn916/tn <dig> family of conjugative transposon  is widespread, but primarily observed in the firmicutes such as enterococci. this ctn-family seems to have a particular ability to acquire accessory genes including resistance determinants, to cause genome rearrangements and to mobilize other replicons. the originally described tn <dig> carries the tetracycline resistance gene tetm. tn <dig> is homologous to tn <dig>  but contains additionally ermb  and apha- <dig>  cassettes . in our array the tn916/tn <dig> family was represented by an integrase , an excisionase  and a conjugative transfer protein gene  as well as the tetracyclin resistance determinant tetm . the integrase, excisionase and conjugative transfer protein genes were significantly more abundant in e. faecalis than e. faecium  as well as in st <dig> than st <dig>  of e. faecium . all e. faecalis strains hybridized to the tn <dig> targets while the tn <dig> specific integrase and excisionase were detected in only 2/ <dig> st <dig> and were absent in st <dig> e. faecium. the esp-containing iceefm <dig> has a conjugation module similar to tn <dig>  <cit> . however, the conjugative transfer protein from this conjugation module shows only about 80% identity at protein level to the tn <dig> prototype protein  and thus the dna identity level was far too low to detect iceefm <dig> through the tn <dig> conjugation protein in our array.

the tn <dig> transposon family transposon tn <dig> is genetically linked to the vana resistance cluster encoding high-level glycopeptide resistance  <cit> . in our array target  <dig> represents the transposase  <cit> , target  <dig> the associated resolvase  <cit>  and target  <dig> the prototypical d-ala:d-lac ligase  of tn <dig>  <cit> , which were present in the same strains except for vana which was found in an additional st <dig> strain . pcr  and phenotypical analysis  confirmed the hybridization patterns .

the conjugative transposon tn5382/tn <dig> is closely linked to the vanb <dig> gene cluster  <cit> . this transposon was represented in our array by probes targeting the genes of the excisionase of tn <dig> , the integrase , the relaxase , the trse-like protein , and the d-alanine:d-lactate ligase  . a moderate number of the e. faecium and e. faecalis strains hybridized to these targets. pcr analyses and antimicrobial susceptibility testing confirmed that vanb was present only in isolates containing all tn5382/tn1549-related targets.

broad content of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance
the enterococcal sts in this study were selected due to their relative dominance in clinically relevant strains. although the presence of resistance traits was not a selection criterion, the collection is biased towards antimicrobial resistance and an overrepresentation of these markers was expected. the phenotypic expression of resistance, examined by standardized ast, was used to validate the hybridization results for defined antimicrobial resistance determinants. moreover, the presence of vana, vanb and aac-aph-ia  was also examined by pcr.

the hybridization results of screening for the antimicrobial resistance determinants are shown in additional file 3: figure s2c and summarized in additional file 5: figure s3c. the results are categorized according to genes encoding resistance towards glycopeptides, aminoglycosides, β-lactams, tetracyclines, mlsb, oxazolidinone, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, biocides and heavy metals. as shown by pca and cluster dendrogram  a separation in gene content between the two species and the two sts of e. faecalis can be seen. defined resistance markers were selected for phenotypic verifications, and we observed an overall high correlation as outlined below.

vancomycin resistance determinants were represented by six targets . a total of 3/ <dig> st <dig> and st <dig> e. faecium and st <dig> e. faecalis strains were positive for the vana target . the vanb target scored positive in 2/ <dig> st <dig> and st <dig> e. faecium strains. the vang and vanl targets scored positive only in one and two e. faecalis st <dig> strains, respectively . phenotypic testing was in agreement with the hybridization results except for the vang and vanl target positive st <dig> strains . a total of 16/ <dig> strains expressed vancomycin resistance of which ten and six strains were confirmed as positive for vana or vanb by pcr, respectively. as compared to vana-, vanb- and vang-specific pcrs, the microarray hybridization results yielded two false negative results  and two potential false positive results . phenotypically silent vana-determinants have previously been reported  <cit> .

the presence of aminoglycoside resistance determinants showed species and st-specific patterns. the e. faecium species-specific target aac-ii  encoding an aminoglycoside 6′-n-acetyltransferase that mediates resistance towards many aminoglycosides except gentamicin was present in all e. faecium strains . target  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> representing sat <dig>  aade and aph-iiia, respectively, were present in at least 10/ <dig> strains of both e. faecium and e. faecalis . other targets representing aminoglycoside resistance determinants were only sporadically present. the gene cluster aade-sat4-apha- <dig> has been linked to composite transposon tn <dig> delimited by is <dig>  <cit> . all three resistance genes were found in 21/ <dig> of the isolates  although aade was additionally present in four, sat <dig> in one and apha- <dig> in three isolates. is <dig> was present in 13/ <dig> of the isolates that contained all three resistance determinants.

due to sequence quality  and target homology problems, the target encoding the bifunctional enzyme aac-ie-aph-ia conferring hlgr was not represented on the array. the presence of the aac-ie-aph-ia gene was therefore analyzed by pcr and yielded 11/ <dig> and 9/ <dig> of e. faecium and e. faecalis positive for this gene, respectively. notably, 7/ <dig> e. faecalis st <dig> while only two e. faecalis st <dig> were positive for aac-ie-aph-ia. a strong correlation between the presence of aac-ie-aph-ia gene and hlgr was observed . this observation is consistent with a recent study of european e. faecalis strains that showed a high prevalence of hlgr in cc <dig>  in contrast to cc <dig>  strains  <cit> .

determinants of tetracycline resistance were represented by five targets . using the clsi clinical breakpoints, a total of 29/ <dig> strains expressed tetracycline resistance . hybridization analyses revealed that all tetracycline resistant strains harbored one; two or three tet-resistance determinants . only 2/ <dig> tetracycline susceptible strains carried tet-resistance determinants , of which both were e. faecium st <dig> strains. interestingly, all e. faecalis strains expressed tetracycline resistance and were shown to carry tetm , tetl  or tetk . thus, there is a strong correlation between the presence of tn916/tn <dig> targets and tetm resistance determinants in e. faecalis. this observation is in contrast with the findings obtained for e. faecium where eight tetm positive strains were negative for tn <dig> xis and int targets. this is even more pronounced than the data from polish vre e. faecium isolates where  <dig> of  <dig> isolates containing tetm also were positive for the tn <dig> integrase gene  <cit> . these observations could be explained by the location of tetm in other conjugative transposons such as tn <dig> or tn <dig>  frequently found in e. faecium  <cit> ; .

erythromycin resistance determinants were represented by eight targets . a total of 31/ <dig> and 8/ <dig> strains showed resistance or intermediate susceptibility to erythromycin using the clsi clinical breakpoints for interpretation . hybridization analyses revealed that all erythromycin resistant strains harbored one of these erythromycin resistance determinants . one susceptible strain was positive for ermb. determinants erma, ermf, ermg, and ermq were not detected. four out of  <dig> intermediate strains did not contain any erythromycin resistance determinants, while the other four were positive for ermb , mef  or mef + ermt . one strain was susceptible and also negative for all erythromycin resistance determinants. acquired resistance towards mlsb in enterococci is most often due to the presence of the ermb gene  <cit> . ermb was identified in 17/ <dig> e. faecium strains as well as 10/ <dig> and 3/ <dig> e. faecalis st <dig> and st <dig> strains, respectively . although ermb was originally described as part of tn <dig> in e. faecalis  <cit>  we do not find a correlation between presence of ermb and tn <dig> targets that were found only in  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the  <dig> st <dig> e. faecalis strains. however, ermb presence have been reported on different plasmids  <cit>  suggesting that ermb is transferred by plasmids among enterococci.

several chloramphenicol acetyltransferases of different origins were represented on the array . target  <dig> scored positive in 5/ <dig> e. faecalis and 3/ <dig> e. faecium strains, while target  <dig> scored positive in 9/ <dig> e. faecalis strains . antimicrobial susceptibility testing towards chloramphenicol was not performed. finally, an oxazolidinone target  representing a gene encoding rrna methylase cfr from a staphylococcus warneri plasmid was present on the array and one e. faecalis strain st <dig> scored positive for this target. however, the strain was susceptible to linezolid, also pcr analysis did not detect the cfr gene  indicating unspecific hybridization.

when summarizing the relative presence of the different antimicrobial resistance determinants  e. faecalis st <dig> strains had the highest positive score  as compared to e. faecium st <dig>  e. faecium st <dig> and e. faecalis st <dig> with an average of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively . the tetm, tets and msrc genes, responsible for tetracycline and erythromycin resistance, respectively, contributed largely to this difference .

high prevalence of genetic determinants for cadmium and qac resistance in e. faecalis st40
while the selected targets representing resistance traits towards copper , mercury , cadmium , and quaternary ammonium compounds   seem uncommon in the e. faecium strain collection, a number of e. faecalis and in particular st <dig> strains hybridized to them . hybridization occurred mainly in the strains most recently recovered . the cadmium and qac resistance determinants were found in the same 6/ <dig> e. faecalis st <dig> strains as well as in 1/ <dig> st <dig> strain but the possible genetic linkage of these resistance determinants will have to be investigated by other methods.

biocide , quartenary ammonium compounds, zinc, phenolic compounds) resistance has been rarely detected among enterococcal strains, despite its frequent detection in clinical isolates of other firmicutes, e.g. the emergence of qac resistance in methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus due to acquisition of plasmid-borne qac genes  <cit> . further, evidence suggests that biocide and antibiotic resistance determinants are linked within the same genetic unit raising the question if the use of biocides can contribute to the selection of antimicrobial resistance  <cit> . however, the previous observed co-localization of the copper resistance determinant with ermb  <cit>  or vana  <cit>  in enterococci from animals was not observed in this strain collection representing four highly prevalent, clinical relevant st types.

delimited presence of prophage determinants
although transduction of virulence and resistance genes were recently demonstrated in enterococci  <cit> , the extent and importance of hgt due to bacteriophages in enterococci is not fully understood. prophage sequences are commonly found in cc <dig> strains  <cit>  including the fully sequenced e. faecalis v <dig> which harbors seven prophage-like elements  <cit> , six of which are proven biologically active  <cit> . based on the current knowledge on these sequences at the time the array was printed, five of them  were represented in our assay, additional file 3: figure s2d and additional file 5: figure s3d. with the exception of one strain from each species, the e. faecalis v <dig> prophage sequences were present in all e. faecalis test strains, and in none of the e. faecium strains. prophage <dig>  is able to excise from the chromosome by the aid of pp <dig> in a manner that resemble chromosomal islands, and have therefore been renamed e. faecalis chromosomal island of v <dig>   <cit> . this target was only found in two e. faecalis st <dig> strains. eight different e. faecium prophage sequences  were represented on the array  <cit> . with one exception , these sequences showed species specificity toward e. faecium. prophage sequences from the clinical e. faecium st <dig> strain u <dig>  dominated the e. faecium strain collection and was especially well distributed in the st <dig> strains.

recent studies have identified additional phage sequences to those included in this array  and one should account a possible different outcome if these were included. however, prophage sequences are commonly found in our collection of e. faecium and e. faecalis strains and are in general species-specific, suggesting hgt events as well as vertical transmission of these prophage sequences.

presence of crispr-cas system only in e. faecalis st <dig> strains
the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat /crispr associated  system provides immunity against bacteriophage infections and mobile genetic elements in prokaryotes by genetic memory and  dna interference . the crispr-cas system was represented in our array by four e. faecalis og1rf crispr associated proteins  and two conserved crispr repeat sequences; one from e. faecium  and e. faecalis og1rf . none of the  <dig> e. faecium strains was positive for any of the crispr-cas targets . this is in agreement with previous reports on hospital adapted e. faecium lineages with a broad content of antibiotic resistance traits  <cit>  and prophage sequences  <cit> . this inverse correlation was also expected for the e. faecalis strains  <cit> ; however 90% of the st <dig> strains contained both crispr and cas sequences, and thus likely a functional system. all these strains also contained multiple acquired antibiotic resistance genes challenging the hypothesis of palmer and gilmore  <cit>  that multidrug resistant enterococci generally lack crispr-cas genes. a similar observation was found in  <dig> multidrug resistant whole genome sequenced e. faecalis st <dig> isolates showing supposedly complete crispr-cas systems  <cit> . it is, however, difficult to elucidate any possible targets for this crispr-cas system without sequencing the crispr spacer region to search for specific target sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
our microarray-based study revealed an overall high prevalence and a species-specific distribution of mobile genetic elements in the selected clinically relevant e. faecium and e. faecalis. for the e. faecalis strains, the presence or absence of these targets also separated the two sts. the separation of e. faecalis st <dig> and st <dig> was especially evident for the biocide genes, e. faecalis prophage sequences and cas genes.

although the presence of broad host range conjugative inc <dig> family replicons substantiates the possibility of inter-species horizontal gene transfer, both species were dominated by narrow host range replicons. the high species-specific prevalence of the rcr family of small cryptic plasmids, the rep_ <dig> family and the repa_n family including plg <dig> megaplasmids and pheromone responsive plasmids imply an evolutionary significant role in the development of the hospital associated sts hosting them.

an association between the ω-ε-ζ plasmid addiction system and inc <dig> plasmids was verified for e. faecium, but the ta locus was also detected in the absence of this plasmid family in both species. the contribution of ta-systems for stable maintenance of important virulence and resistance carrying plasmids in enterococcus is also underlined by the high prevalence of the axe-txe locus and its association to the repa_n plasmids in the e. faecium strains.

specific is elements are distributed in only one of the species implying that these have evolved vertically. however, the presence of most is families in both specific strains e. faecalis and e. faecium suggest that these elements are also spread by hgt. within e. faecium, tn916/tn <dig> and is <dig> were specific for st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively. all  <dig> e. faecalis strains contained sequences of tn916/tn <dig>  while is families of is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> showed a preference towards st <dig>  the relative lack of tn <dig> family conjugative transposons in e. faecium compared to e. faecalis in our strains fits with most reports of this transposon family in e. faecalis. there was also a strong correlation between the presence of tn <dig> targets and tetm in e. faecalis that was not found in the e. faecium strains. the presence of tn <dig> resolvase and transposase in only one and two of the  <dig> strains that harbored ermb correlates well with few descriptions of tn <dig> containing enterococci in the literature although ermb was originally described as part of this transposon in e. faecalis.

the overall findings confirm and unfold our previous knowledge on the extensive reservoir of mobile genetic elements and underline their importance in evolutionary development of clinical relevant lineages of enterococci. moreover, the detected mge pattern support a significant species- and for e. faecalis, even a st-based evolution rather than a high degree of hgt between these important hospital-associated clades.
