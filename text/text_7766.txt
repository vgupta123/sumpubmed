BACKGROUND
since its initial isolation in california in  <dig>  <cit> , enterovirus   <dig> was identified to have caused outbreaks of severe neurological disease in australia, europe, asia, and the americas  <cit> . several epidemic outbreaks with high mortality rates have occurred in bulgaria in  <dig> with  <dig> deaths  <cit> , in hungary in  <dig> with  <dig> deaths  <cit> , and in malaysia in  <dig> with at least  <dig> deaths  <cit> . in a  <dig> epidemic, taiwan had  <dig> severe ev <dig> cases with  <dig> deaths. in  <dig> to  <dig>  there were dozens of fatal ev <dig> cases each year in taiwan  <cit> . a stage-based management scheme was developed to reduce the number of case fatalities in taiwan  <cit> , but most survivors of brainstem encephalitis plus cardiopulmonary failure might have neurologic sequelae and impaired cognition  <cit> . clinically, ev <dig> is capable of causing paralytic disease indistinguishable from poliomyelitis due to the poliovirus. after the poliovirus was nearly eradicated by vaccination, ev <dig> is now considered one of the most important enteroviruses. its genome consists of a positive single-stranded rna molecule of approximately  <dig> nucleotides long. the rna is translated to give a polyprotein which is then proteolytically processed to yield the mature structural p <dig> domain  and non-structural p <dig>  and p <dig> domains .

there are two major ev <dig> genotypes  co-circulating worldwide . genotypes b and c are subdivided into sub-genotypes b1~b <dig> and c1~c <dig>  respectively  <cit> . despite many studies having focused on the molecular epidemiology of ev <dig>  <cit> , several aspects of the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics are still not clear. in particular, most studies of molecular epidemiology focused only on a single region, particularly vp <dig>  without exploring the dynamics at the genomic scale. there are no rigorous measurements of viral variations within an outbreak and among different epidemic seasons. in addition, although the evolutionary rate of vp <dig> was estimated  <cit> , little is known as to whether there are discrepancies in immune-related structural vs. non-structural regions and in protein-coding vs. non-coding segments of the ev <dig> genome. finally, the processes through which new viral genotypes are generated and evolve are largely unknown.

to help resolve these issues, we examined the evolutionary dynamics of ev <dig> by analyzing  <dig> viral isolates sampled in  <dig> to  <dig> in taiwan. four genomic regions, including one capsid protein , two proteases which cleave the viral polypeptide , and the 5'untranslated region , were sequenced. phylogenetic relationships of viruses isolated from different outbreaks were analyzed. we investigated the nucleotide diversity and divergence for different genomic segments, which revealed contrasting patterns for different protein coding regions. based on the above results, we propose a possible scenario of how new ev <dig> genotypes emerge and evolve. finally, we estimated the evolutionary rate and population dynamics of ev <dig> 

RESULTS
the complete vp <dig>  2a, and 3c and partial 5'utr regions of  <dig> ev <dig> and  <dig> coxsackievirus a 16-like  strains isolated in taiwan in  <dig> to  <dig> were determined. the aligned lengths of vp <dig>  2a, and 3c were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively. the aligned 5'utr region including indels was  <dig> nucleotides long, which spans  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides of ev71-a . therefore,  <dig> nucleotides were sequenced from each of the  <dig> viral isolates. the strains examined in this study are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  with the year of isolation and associated clinical symptoms, if known. according to sequence similarities of vp <dig>  genotypes of the recovered viral strains are listed in table  <dig>  as previously reported  <cit> , ev71-c <dig> was the major etiologic group in  <dig>  and ev71-b <dig> became predominant during the period from  <dig> to  <dig>  our large-scale survey also revealed that in addition to the major genotype, there were genotypes with very low frequencies co-circulating each year. for example, in addition to the previously reported ev71-c <dig> and -b <dig>  ev71-c <dig> and ca16-like were also recovered in  <dig>  in addition, genotype c <dig> was found in  <dig>  and genotypes c <dig> and ca16-like were discovered in  <dig> 

phylogeny and recombination of ev71
within each segment, the homoplasy test  <cit> , geneconv  <cit> , and gard  <cit>  failed to identify any recombination event for either within- or between-genotype comparisons. in order to test for possible recombinations between sequenced regions, we combined the four segments for further analysis. the concatenated dataset was divided into  <dig> lineages at the 1% level of divergence. according to sequence similarities of vp <dig>  genotype b <dig> included four lineages ; genotype c contained three lineages, i.e., lineages  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> ; and ca16-like had two lineages,  <dig> and  <dig>  the last lineage which contained only one viral isolate, tw-2051- <dig>  was identified as a recombinant of lineages  <dig> and  <dig>  with the breaking point located between 2a and 3c, and thus it was excluded from further analysis . no other recombination was detected within any lineage. the occurrences of major lineages from  <dig> to  <dig> are given in figure  <dig>  with the exception of  <dig>  ev <dig> outbreaks in each season contained only one major lineage. in addition, each lineage was unique to that sampled season with no recurrence in later outbreaks. for example, lineage  <dig> was from  <dig> and  <dig>  lineages  <dig> and  <dig> contained viral strains recovered mainly from  <dig>  and lineage  <dig> included viruses from  <dig> to  <dig> 

phylogenetic relationships of viral strains derived from different genomic regions are given in figure  <dig> which only shows abridged phylogenies. the complete phylogenetic trees are available in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  with the exception of the 2a region, phylogenies derived from different regions, including the 5'utr, vp <dig>  and 3c, support monophyletic origins of the different lineages  in most cases, further supporting no recombination existing between them. since essentially identical relationships of different ev <dig> lineages were yielded by the maximum-likelihood , neighbor-joining , and bayesian inference  methods, we only present the phylogenetic trees constructed by nj method with nodal supports derived from nj, ml, and bi analyses given at the nodes.

in the vp <dig> region, ev71-b <dig> recovered from different years closely agreed with the phylogenetic positions. lineage  <dig> was at the base of the b <dig> clade followed by lineages  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  a monophyletic origin of genotype c, including lineages  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> was strongly supported by the nj method but with only a 50% bootstrap value in the ml method . these three lineages together with ev71-a and -b <dig> formed a monophyletic group with a high bootstrap value . ca <dig> and its related strain, ca16-like, formed a sister group to ev <dig>  in the 2a region , all above mentioned lineages are still formed but with low bootstrap support. ca <dig> did not form a sister group to lineages  <dig> and  <dig> as shown in figure 2a. in the 3c region, lineages  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were not clustered together as in figure 2a and 2b. instead, lineages  <dig> and  <dig> were a sister group to ca <dig> with 99% bootstrap support in both the ml and nj methods and 73% probability for bi analysis . furthermore, ca <dig> was not a sister group to lineages  <dig> and  <dig>  the former was clustered with ca <dig>  and the latter pair was clustered at the bottom of the tree with ca <dig>  ca <dig>  ca <dig>  ca <dig>  ca <dig>  and ev71-a . in the nj tree constructed using the 5'utr, lineages  <dig> and  <dig> together were a sister group to ca <dig> .

inconsistent phylogenies derived from different genomic regions imply frequent recombinations between different species of human enterovirus species -a as previously noted  <cit> . in figure  <dig>  lineages  <dig> and  <dig> clustered tightly with ca <dig> in the 3c and 5'utr regions, but they were recognized as ev <dig> genotype c  based on the vp <dig> sequences. it is likely that genotypes c <dig> and c <dig> were generated by acquiring the structural domain of ancestral ev <dig>  we further used the bootscan program to detect the region of possible recombination. when ev71-c <dig> and -c <dig> were compared against different viruses of hev-a, two recombination events between ca <dig> and ev <dig>  in the 5'utr  and 2a regions  were clearly demonstrated . other examples of sequence acquisition were provided by the analyses of the ev71-c <dig>  and ca16-like  viral strains, the structural domains of which only resembled those of ev71-c1+c <dig> and ca <dig>  respectively. interestingly, in the above three cases, the break points of recombination were all located at the 3' end of the 5'utr and 2a regions which neatly covers the entire structural  domain of the enterovirus.

nucleotide diversity and divergence
average numbers of mutation per site for each year are given in table  <dig>  we focused only on the major genotypes of each year, including ev71-c <dig> from  <dig> and ev71-b <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  the nucleotide polymorphisms  of the 5'utr in different years were  <dig> %~ <dig> % which were significantly lower than those of synonymous sites  of the three protein coding regions . in addition to low polymorphism, the 5'utr had higher proportions of singletons than did synonymous sites of protein coding regions. proportions of non-singletons polymorphisms, i.e., the number of mutations which occurred more than once divided by the number of total mutations, in the 5'utr was significant lower than those of synonymous sites of vp <dig> , 2a , and 3c . θs values derived from different coding regions ranged  <dig> %~ <dig> % for vp <dig>   <dig> %~ <dig> % for 2a, and  <dig> %~ <dig> % for 3c, and the differences among them were not significant . nevertheless, nucleotide polymorphisms at nonsynonymous sites  of vp <dig>  ranging  <dig> %~ <dig> %, were significantly lower than those of 2a and 3c which were  <dig> %~ <dig> % . consequently, the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms  of vp <dig>  ranging  <dig> ~ <dig> , were 2~3-times smaller than those of 2a and 3c . we also analyzed differences in ratios of nonsynonymous  to synonymous  mutations among the three coding regions. the n/s ratios for vp <dig>  at  <dig> ~ <dig> , were smaller than those of 2a  and 3c . the difference between vp <dig> and 2a became insignificant after the singletons were removed.

ka and ks values between ev <dig> and hev-a are shown in table  <dig>  since the outgroup of ev <dig> was difficult to identify, other than for the vp <dig> region , results are expressed as the average divergence between ev <dig> and different species of hev-a. divergences of the 5'utr , ranging  <dig> ~ <dig> , were much lower than ks values of the protein coding regions, which ranged  <dig> ~ <dig>  . the ka of vp <dig> between ev <dig> and other hev-as, being  <dig>  for ev71-b <dig> and  <dig>  for ev71-c <dig>  were higher than those of 2a and 3c which were  <dig> ~ <dig> . as a result, rates of protein evolution after calibration by the neutral mutation rate  for vp <dig>  at  <dig>  and  <dig> , were much higher than those of 2a and 3c, at  <dig> ~ <dig> . small ka and ka/ks values between ev71-b <dig> and -c <dig>  at  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicated that among different genotypes of ev <dig>  vp <dig> was extremely conserved.

tests for positive selection
since ks was saturated, the ka/ks ratio should be interpreted with care. we tested whether different protein coding regions had different selection regimes by hyphy . the results of likelihood ratio test  revealed no sign for codon under positive selection. in addition, compared to vp <dig>  2a and 3c were under stronger purifying selection . therefore, higher ka/ks ratio in vp <dig> cannot be solely imputed to the saturation on synonymous sites, which suggests that different evolutionary forces may have dominated different regions of the genome.

different approaches were applied to test the hypothesis of positive selection in the vp <dig> region. we first performed site model tests implemented in paml to search for evidence of positive selection. the results of lrts for m1a vs. m2a and m <dig> vs. m <dig> were both insignificant, suggesting that the evidence of positive selection working on a particular codon was limited. using model m2a, we estimated that 98% of the codons were subject to negative selection with an average ka/ks ratio of  <dig> , 2% had evolved under near neutrality with ka/ks ≈  <dig>  and there was no site with ka/ks >  <dig>  we also used branch-site model a to test for positive selection on individual sites along specific lineages . different lineages were sequentially assigned as foreground branches to test against the null model with ka/ks =  <dig>  this test also failed to detect a signature of positive selection on specific branches. paml also implemented a suzuki and gojobori-style  <cit>  method to test the effects of selection at individual sites with changes according to ancestral states reconstructed by the likelihood method. the results suggested that 98% of the sites were under negative selection, and that only 2% had ka/ks values of >  <dig>  but they were all insignificant. similar results were noted in the analysis of the poliovirus surface protein  <cit> . therefore, within enterovirus, evidence of positive selection at individual sites was limited.

because synonymous substitutions were saturated , the standard ka/ks analysis might not be a suitable statistical test for positive selection. we, therefore, performed computer simulations. in each of  <dig>  simulations, the number of nucleotide changes was drawn from a poisson distribution until ks was equal to the average ks between ev <dig> and hev-a . ratios of nonsynonymous  to synonymous  mutations were chosen according to the observed n/s ratios in the polymorphisms, which were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for vp <dig>  2a, and 3c, respectively . the objective of this test is to detect natural selection in the sequences. if the selection intensity is constant over the evolutionary time scale, the ratio of n to s fixations should be equal to the ratio of n to s polymorphisms. the pattern will differ, however, when other forms of selection act on nonsynonymous mutations. positive selection will increase the divergence relative to polymorphisms at selected sites, whereas negative selection is expected to result in the opposite pattern.

simulations were done for both ev71-c <dig> and b <dig>  and the results were essentially the same. for illustrative purposes, we only present the results of genotype b <dig> . for vp <dig>  the observed ka and ka/ks values were significantly higher than the simulated results , indicating accelerated fixation of amino acid replacement substitutions. such a pattern was reversed for 2a and 3c . in the 3c region, the observed ka and ka/ks values were lower than the predictions, but the difference was insignificant. significantly lower ka and ka/ks values in the simulations than in observations for 2a suggest the effect of negative selection preventing deleterious mutations from becoming fixed. deleterious mutations are usually at a low frequency and inflate the n/s ratio of polymorphisms. this problem can be partially overcome by removing rare mutations from the sample  <cit> . the n/s ratio of 2a was largely reduced, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , after singletons were removed. we then reset the n/s ratio from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for 2a in the simulation, and differences in ka and ka/ks between observations and predictions became non-significant . in short, when singletons were not counted, 2a and 3c showed good agreement with the neutral mutation hypothesis.

reduced levels of polymorphism and divergence in the 5'utr resemble general patterns of protein evolution and indicate that the 5'utr was either under selection or was subjected to a lower mutation rate than were synonymous sites. a framework, proposed by mcdonald and kreitman , of comparing levels of polymorphism within and divergence between different viruses can distinguish neutrality from selection in the sequences  <cit> . if reduced levels of polymorphism and divergence in the 5'utr can be explained by a lower mutation rate, the ratio of polymorphisms to divergences should be similar to that for synonymous sites. although, the mk test was originally developed to detect selection at classes of different sites that have the same evolutionary history, it can also be generalized to consider other classes of selected sites from different regions, including non-coding regions  <cit> , even when they are completely unlinked  <cit> . we then applied the mk test to the 5'utr of ev71-c <dig> vs. ca <dig> and ev71-c <dig> vs. -c <dig> using polymorphisms and divergence in the 3c region as a reference, because ca <dig> was strongly supported as the outgroup of ev71-c <dig> and -c <dig> in these two regions  and because ks values between ca <dig> and ev71-c <dig> at  <dig>  and between ev71-c <dig> and -c <dig> at  <dig>  were not saturated.

we first applied the mk test using all polymorphisms, and the non-significant results suggested a neutral pattern of molecular evolution which seemed to support a low mutation rate in the 5'utr of hev-a. nevertheless, since the 5'utr exhibited many rare variants  which may be deleterious and are likely to be a factor limiting the power to detect selection in the sequences  <cit> , we next removed all singletons from the sequences. applying this approach revealed a significant excess of divergence in the 5'utr of ev71-c <dig> compared to ca <dig>  and ev71-c <dig> . this result suggested that a significant fraction of divergence in the 5'utr was probably driven to fixation by positive selection.

population demographics and the rate of change
evolutionary dynamics, represented by the vp <dig> region, were estimated using an established bayesian markov chain monte carlo  approach that incorporates the month of viral sampling. in the absence of natural selection, the genetic diversity obtained reflects the change in the effective number of infections over time  <cit> . nevertheless, a possible role of selection was demonstrated for vp <dig> of ev <dig> in a previous section; the plot was interpreted as a measure of the relative genetic diversity. changing patterns of genetic diversity clearly showed temporal dynamics of ev <dig> isolated from  <dig> to  <dig> . two peaks, from left to right, respectively represent the outbreak from late  <dig> to  <dig>  and the epidemic seasons of  <dig> to  <dig> . genetic diversities were largely reduced at the end of each epidemic season demonstrating genetic bottlenecks. because ev71-c <dig>  was mainly recovered in  <dig> which yielded a large uncertainty in the diversity estimation, we did not include lineage  <dig> in figure  <dig> 

for each region, the time to the most recent common ancestor  recovered from different outbreaks was separately estimated . for lineage  <dig>  and lineages  <dig> and  <dig>  the tmrcas derived from different segments were very close, indicating that within these epidemic seasons, different genomic regions may have shared similar evolutionary histories. for lineage  <dig>  the tmrcas of four different segments exhibited greater variation than the above three lineages. all the tmrcas predated the beginning of the outbreaks. for example, the tmrca of vp <dig> of lineages  <dig> and  <dig>  both of which caused the epidemic from late  <dig> to  <dig>  was  <dig>   with the 95% highest posterior density  ranging  <dig> ~ <dig> . the tmrca of vp <dig> for viral strains recovered from  <dig> to  <dig>  was  <dig>  . since our sequences were collected within a relatively short period of time which may have constrained the posterior distribution of that tmrca, we next included vp <dig> sequences collected between the  <dig> s and  <dig> from surrounding areas for tmrca estimation . the results shown in table  <dig> are close to our original estimations with narrower 95% hpds. we also performed a bayesian mcmc analysis using randomly associated sequences and dates. for the vp <dig> region, the tmrcas of the generated dataset were  <dig>  for lineage  <dig> and  <dig>  for lineages  <dig> and  <dig>  therefore, our estimation of tmrcas is sound.

the evolutionary rates of different genomic segments of ev71-b <dig> recovered in this study between  <dig> and  <dig> were estimated. the overall rates of change estimated by the linear regression method for the vp <dig>  2a, 3c, and 5'utr regions were  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site per year , respectively. these values are generally in good agreement with those derived from the bayesian mcmc method which were  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10-3/site/year for vp <dig>  2a, 3c, and 5'utr, respectively . in addition, evolutionary rates estimated by the linear regression fell within the 95% hpds derived from the bayesian mcmc method. similar values derived from different approaches indicated that our estimates were authentic. for the protein coding regions, approximately 70%~90% of all changes were synonymous changes . we then estimated the rate of change for the third codon position by bayesian mcmc and on synonymous sites by the linear regression method . the evolutionary rate for third codon position for vp <dig>  2a, and 3c were  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> , respectively. because not all changes on the third codon position are synonymous, these values are smaller than synonymous mutation rates which were  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10-2/site/year for vp <dig>  2a, and 3c, respectively. for the 2a and 3c regions, synonymous mutation rates are close to that of the poliovirus   <cit> , but higher than estimates by hanada et al.   <cit>  and brown et al.   <cit>  of enterovirus.

discussion
signature of the positive selection of ev71
vp <dig> was previously demonstrated to have rapidly evolved  <cit> . the question is whether positive selection needs to be invoked to account for the high rate of amino acid substitutions or whether alternative explanations of past population demographics, relaxation of selective constraints, and elevation of the mutation rate are sufficient. it was argued that accelerated amino acid substitutions can occur if some nonsynonymous mutations are slightly deleterious, and the current effective population size is larger than the long-term effective population size  <cit> ; this is because slightly deleterious mutations that are currently not segregated in the population may have been fixed in the past. a historical reduction in population size will also have generated an excess of amino acid substitutions in divergence  <cit> . for viruses producing only acute infections, such as ev <dig> and influenza, the population size  exponentially increases during an outbreak and then experiences a dramatic reduction after the epidemic. the population dynamics shown in figure  <dig> clearly demonstrate that ev <dig> experienced dramatic population size changes between the different epidemic seasons. nevertheless, while positive selection acts on specific target regions, the influence of population demographics affects all regions of the genome. smaller ka and ka/ks values found in non-structural regions  than in the structural region   demonstrated that accelerated amino acid substitutions in the latter are not a genome-wide phenomenon and, thus, are unlikely to solely be the consequence of population size changes. if relaxation of selective constraints is responsible for the rapid amino acid replacement between different viruses, levels of θa and θa/θs in vp <dig> should have increased accordingly. this is not expected under positive selection because mutations would have short retention times in the population and hence would contribute little to polymorphisms. significantly lower θa and θa/θs values in vp <dig> than in 2a and 3c  indicate no sign of relaxation in the former. finally, comparable levels of θs among the three protein coding regions clearly illustrate no significant differences in their underlying mutation rates. consequently, the rapid evolution of vp <dig> cannot be reconciled with past population demographics, relaxation of selection, or differences in mutation rates. the contrasting patterns of polymorphism and divergence in vp <dig>  thus, should best be explained by the hypothesis that positive darwinian selection is responsible for the high rate of amino acid replacements.

among the three outer surface proteins, vp <dig>  vp <dig>  and vp <dig>  which comprise the outer surface of the viral capsid, serotype-specific immune epitopes are predominantly located in vp <dig>  <cit> . immunization using a recombinant vp <dig> protein of ev <dig> was shown to confer protection against lethal ev <dig> infection in newborn mice, indicating that vp <dig> contains important antigenic sites  <cit> . in addition, vp <dig> plays an important role in cell attachment  <cit> . it is, therefore, temping to speculate that vp <dig> is under strong selection by host immune systems which would result in accelerated amino acid changes between different species of hev-a.

while our simulation results suggest positive selection in the vp <dig> region, codon-based lrts failed to detect such a signal. this inconsistency was probably due to the following reasons. first, simulations demonstrated that lrts are not robust to frequent recombinations  <cit>  which is very common in enteroviruses . nevertheless, recombination does not create contrasting patterns of polymorphisms and divergences in different genomic regions. second, as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  nucleotide sequences were highly diverged between different species and genotypes of hev-a, but were very similar within each genotype. it was proposed that highly biased trees might harbor too many changes along the long branches and too few changes along the short branches, leading to a lack of information and low power of the detection method  <cit> . tee et al.  applied globally sampled vp <dig> sequences and identified three putative sites under positive selection  <cit> , suggesting that a more comprehensive sampling may be necessary to identify site under selection.

couple lines of evidence also suggest that the 5'utr may be under positive selection. first, after singletons were removed, the results of the mk test in table  <dig> suggested an excess of nucleotide substitutions in divergence, implying the action of selection. second, a higher proportion of singletons in the 5'utr than in synonymous sites of protein coding regions  implied that the effect of selection has kept deleterious mutations at low frequencies. the 5'utr of ev <dig> contains six putative stem-loop structures  <cit> . stem-loop i is essential for viral rna synthesis, while stem-loop ii-vi comprise the internal ribosome entry site  necessary for translation initiation  <cit> . the maintenance of these structure elements is critical for viral viability. mutations which destroy base pairing within the stem are therefore deleterious  <cit>  and will be eliminated or kept in low frequency. on the other hand, compensatory mutations which restore base pairing might have to be fixed at once in order to maintain proper secondary structure. in short, the 5'utr plays important roles for viral rna synthesis and translation initiation, and the reduced levels of polymorphism and divergence may be a result of selection.

mechanism generating new genotypes
it was proposed that recombination contributed to the emergence of various species/genotypes of enterovirus  <cit> . instead of random recombinations, however, we observed a consistent phenomenon of acquiring the p <dig> domain from different genotypes or species of hev-a. it is unreasonable to expect that chance alone would generate such a repeating pattern . frequent sequence shuffling, i.e., acquiring a piece of a nucleotide sequence from different viruses, may have had important impacts on the evolution of enteroviruses. as shown by the signature of positive selection in the vp <dig> region, it is possible that acquiring the p <dig> domain from donors which carry rapid and presumably adaptive changes would cause these recipient viral strains to gain immediate advantage over others. consequently, based on the current molecular genetic analysis and previous phylogenetic studies  <cit> , we hypothesized that positive selection and frequent domain shuffling are two important mechanisms for generating new types of enteroviruses.

it must be pointed out that the results in figure  <dig> do not themselves provide evidence that these genotypes were generated by recombination between particular viral strains. for example, in the analysis of ev71-c1+c <dig>  when we used either ev71-b or ev71-a, separately, or combined them as one reference group, the results were identical. but when ev71-a and -b were both presented as different reference groups, neither of them showed high relatedness with ev71-c1+c <dig> in the p <dig> domain. that is because both ev71-a and -b are equal distances from ev71-c1+c <dig> in that region . therefore, it is possible that ev71-c1+c <dig> was generated by ancestral sequences of ca <dig> and ev <dig> or viral strains very close to them.

origin of local outbreaks
observations of high viral diversity during epidemic peaks with periodic reductions suggest that either the viruses were maintained in the population and across inter-epidemic intervals or the viruses were imported from other sources as shown in a previous study  <cit> . co-circulation of different viral genotypes in extremely low frequencies might be an indication of the former . it is possible that these viral strains had been in circulation for some time before the number of cases became large enough to be noted. for example, the viral strains causing the 1999~ <dig> outbreak were first sampled in september  <dig> . as the tmrca estimated for that outbreak ranged  <dig> ~ <dig> , the above hypothesis suggests that the virus had been circulating for approximately a year before it was sampled. nevertheless, as ev <dig> has been rigorously monitored since the  <dig> outbreak in taiwan, it seems unlikely that the virus was able to remain unnoted or did not cause any severe case for almost a year while in circulation. furthermore, the estimated tmrcas were all beyond the beginning of the outbreak in which they were sampled . to further investigate the phylogenetic origin of different lineages, we acquired ev <dig> sequences from surrounding areas during the  <dig> s to  <dig>  phylogenetic relationships of different viral strains is given in figure  <dig>  lineage  <dig> is phylogenetically close to viral strains reported in malaysia, australia, and japan between  <dig> and  <dig>  lineage  <dig> from  <dig> and  <dig> was tightly clustered with the b <dig> strain from malaysia in  <dig>  lineages  <dig> and  <dig> were grouped with viral isolates from malaysia between  <dig> and  <dig>  finally, lineage  <dig> was closest to the b <dig> strain from australia in  <dig>  figure  <dig> suggests that ev <dig> in taiwan is frequently imported and perhaps moves from and to surrounding areas. because local viral isolates showed more than 97% identity to their sister group which had been circulating in surrounding areas immediately prior to an outbreak, the importation of viral strains to the local area is the most parsimonious explanation. both tmrcas and phylogenetic analyses failed to support the maintenance of viral diversity locally. alternatively, our results may actually indicate that viral diversities were not maintained in the local area, but were imported from other sources.

our conclusion of viral importation is not consistent with previous study which suggested that ev <dig> outbreaks caused by the same subgenotype in different countries may be the result of different lineages and were less likely to have been caused by transmission between countries  <cit> . this conclusion was drawn from the analysis of vp <dig> sequences at global scale, nevertheless. it is possible that different lineages are indeed maintained in a large area with occasional movement of viral lineages between continents, while within each area, e.g. east asia, transmissions between borders may be still common  <cit> .

our estimated rates of change for synonymous sites of 2a and 3c were close to that of the poliovirus   <cit> , but higher than estimations by hanada et al.  <cit> , and brown et al.  <cit>  of enterovirus. this discrepancy is reconcilable by distinguishing the mutation rate, which is related to the tempo of change at the population level, from the substitution rate, which reflects long-term evolutionary change. when mutations are selectively neutral, or nearly so, the rate at which they are generated  should have a simple relation with the rate of fixation   <cit> . deviation from this neutral expectation can reveal fundamental aspects of evolutionary and biological processes  <cit> . under negative selection, mildly deleterious mutations can linger in populations, contributing to polymorphisms, but have little chance of fixation  <cit> . therefore, the rate of evolutionary change based on population-level estimates would be larger than those based on long-term follow-up studies, as the former includes mutations doomed by elimination. in our simulations, after singletons were removed, the difference in n/s ratios between polymorphisms and divergences became insignificant , indicating the existence of low-frequency deleterious mutations in polymorphisms. the rates of change for the poliovirus  <cit>  and ev <dig> in the current study were derived in a short period of time and are expected to be close to population-level estimates. it is then not unreasonable that these values are larger than those of previous long-term studies  <cit> .

the above scenario can also explain the seemingly counterintuitive observation that the rate of change for the vp <dig> capsid protein was slower than those of 2a and 3c which have only internal functions . it is generally expected that segments expressed on the surface of a virion will have higher rates of evolutionary change than those that only have internal functions, because the former have roles in immune evasion. we showed that vp <dig> has experienced strong positive selection which increased its divergence and decreased polymorphisms. as a result, the rate of change derived from the polymorphic data should be slower for vp <dig>  because strong selection makes the population less polymorphic .

lack of recombination in the current viral isolates
only one recombination event identified in  <dig> viral isolates seems inconsistent with the general notion that enteroviruses frequently recombine. nevertheless, except for the year  <dig>  there was only one dominant lineage in each epidemic season. the chance of recombination between different lineages was, thus, reduced. in addition, levels of nucleotide variations within lineages were < 1%. most methods for detecting recombinations perform poorly at this level of divergence  <cit> . it is, then, not surprising that only one recombined viral strain was identified. it is worth pointing out that even though there might be a small chance of unidentified recombinants, our conclusions might not or only minimally be affected for a couple of reasons. first, recombination within a lineage does not change the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations or the n/s ratio in a circulating viral population, and, thus, will not influence the observed nucleotide diversities and simulation results. second, in the analysis of the tmrca and mutation rate, beast assumes no recombination and accounts for deviations from this in the data with multiple mutations. as a result, it may overestimate genetic diversities and mutation rates  with the existence of recombinations  <cit> . while the effect of recombinations on tmrca estimations is still being debated  <cit> , tmrcas from different regions were in generally agreement with each other. thus, unless different genomic regions have similar patterns of recombination, the existence of unidentified recombinations, if any, should not largely affect our conclusions.

CONCLUSIONS
contrasting patterns of polymorphisms and divergences between different protein coding regions suggest that different evolutionary forces have been dominant in different regions of the ev <dig> genome. the results of a computer simulation demonstrated a significant excess of amino acid replacements in the vp <dig> region of local viral isolates which implies a possible role of adaptive evolution. among different species of hev-a, exchange of the p <dig> domain was frequently observed. we propose that positive selection followed by domain shuffling contributed to the emergence of new hev-a genotypes. consistent patterns of an increase in viral diversity in the epidemic peak followed by severe diversity reduction were observed in different epidemic seasons. in addition, the viruses sampled in local successive epidemic seasons were not sister to each other, indicating that annual outbreaks of ev <dig> were due to genetically distinct lineages. it is likely that the importation of ev <dig> from surrounding areas contributed to local outbreaks.
