BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a facultative pathogenic gram-positive bacterium that is well known as colonizer of the human skin, and is a leading cause of diseases ranging from mild skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening illnesses, such as deep post-surgical infections, septicemia and toxic shock syndrome  <cit> . methicillin-resistant s. aureus  and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus  are responsible for a large proportion of nosocomial infections, which makes treatment difficult  <cit> . during the past decade, an increasing number of mrsa cases has been encountered globally among healthy community residents  <cit> . these isolates are referred to as community-acquired mrsa , which are genetically and phenotypically different from representative hospital-acquired mrsa , in relation to their antibiotic resistance patterns, and by the allocation of their staphylococcal chromosomal cassette  types, iv and v  <cit> . coagulase-negative staphylococci  were regarded as harmless skin commensals prior to the 1970s; however, they are now recognized as important causes of human infections  <cit> . cons are also among the most commonly isolated bacteria in clinical microbiology laboratories  <cit> . furthermore, cons often serve as reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistance determinants, since they usually have a high prevalence of multidrug resistance. therefore, it is important to describe and distinguish s. aureus strains and cons  <cit> . methicillin resistance in staphylococci is mainly mediated by the over-production of pbp2a, an additional modified penicillin-binding protein with low affinity for β-lactam antibiotics. the meca gene, the structural determinant that encodes pbp2a, is therefore considered as a useful molecular marker of putative methicillin resistance in s. aureus and cons  <cit> .

clinical laboratory tests for methicillin resistance are highly dependent on growing conditions such as temperature, ph and salt concentration  <cit> . thus, these factors emphasize the need to develop a rapid, accurate and sensitive method for detection of methicillin-resistant staphylococci, which does not depend on growth conditions. nucleic-acid-based tests using pcr are increasingly being used in laboratories to replace time-consuming, labor intensive and less sensitive conventional diagnostic methods, such as biochemical identification and kirby-bauer antimicrobial susceptibility tests. various pcr methods have been developed to identify:  staphylococcus genus  <cit> ;  methicillin-resistance  <cit> ; and  panton-valentine leukocidin -producing staphylococcus genus  <cit> . these methods do not detect all of the above-mentioned targets simultaneously. hence, the present study focused on the design of a pentaplex pcr for methicillin-resistant staphylococci with an internal control for the detection of staphylococcus genus , methicillin-resistant staphylococci , community-acquired mrsa , and discrimination between s. aureus and cons .

RESULTS
in the present study, the pentaplex pcr was optimized successfully to identify the staphylococcus genus , s. aureus species , methicillin resistance  and pvl toxin  genes simultaneously. stepwise optimization of primer concentration, annealing temperature, mgcl <dig>  dntp and taq polymerase was carried out. the pentaplex pcr gave the best results when  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> μm dntp,  <dig>  u taq polymerase and 60°c annealing temperature were used. the analytical sensitivity of the pentaplex pcr at the dna level was found to be  <dig> ng dna , whereas, at the bacterial level, it was found to be  <dig> cfu/ml . the analytical specificity of the pentaplex pcr assay at the genus level was determined using  <dig> staphylococcal reference strains and found to be positive for the staphylococcus genus specific 16s rrna gene. a representative gel picture of methicillin resistance with reference strains is shown in figure  <dig>  while the other  <dig> gram-positive non-staphylococcal and  <dig> gram-negative strains were negative. all the reference strains of s. aureus were positive for fema gene by pentaplex pcr, while other cons species were negative . hence, all methicillin-resistant reference strains were positive for meca gene by pentaplex pcr. however, the methicillin-sensitive reference strains were negative for meca gene by pentaplex pcr . overall, the analytical specificity of pentaplex pcr was 100% for the detection of mrsa reference strains.

upon completion of the standardization of the methicillin-resistant pentaplex pcr assay with reference strains, the assay was validated with  <dig> clinical isolates. among these, all had 16s rrna,  <dig> contained meca,  <dig> had fema and none had luks genes by pentaplex pcr. however, by the conventional e-test antimicrobial susceptibility method,  <dig> of the isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococci . one of the s. aureus isolates that was positive for meca gene by pentaplex pcr was found to be sensitive to oxacillin by the conventional mic method. the diagnostic accuracy of a pentaplex pcr for 16s rrna and fema genes was determined using  <dig> clinical isolates and found to have 100% sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. however, the pentaplex pcr for the meca gene detection showed  <dig> % of sensitivity,  <dig> % of specificity, and  <dig> % of positive and  <dig> % of negative predictive values in detecting methicillin-resistant staphylococci.

discussion
the present study is believed to be the first to develop a combined molecular test for the rapid identification and discrimination of the staphylococcus genus from others, with simultaneous discrimination of methicillin-resistant from -susceptible staphylococcal strains, s. aureus from cons, and concomitant detection of pvl genes. although there are numerous reports on pcr assays for the detection of methicillin resistance  <cit> , only a few of them have incorporated internal controls in their assays to rule out false-negative results  <cit> . according to guidelines for molecular diagnostic methods for infectious diseases  <cit> , incorporation of an internal control in the reaction is essential for the diagnostic test to exclude false-negative results or the presence of inhibitors  <cit> . in the present study, the inclusion of a 759-bp internal control in the pentaplex pcr assay helped us to rule out false-negative results or pcr inhibitors. to deal with applicability and accuracy, we further applied our pentaplex pcr assay to test a total of  <dig> mrsa,  <dig> mssa,  <dig> methicillin-sensitive cons, and  <dig> methicillin-resistant cons from routine clinical specimens obtained from hospital universiti sains malaysia.

the staphylococcus genus consists of at least  <dig> unique species, and only a few have been recovered from humans  <cit> . previously published staphylococcal genus specific primers  <cit>  do not target wholly conserved regions in the staphylococcal 16s rrna gene, which results in misdetection of some important cons. therefore, we designed a new conserved staphylococcus genus-specific primer and included it in our new pentaplex pcr assay, which allowed us to detect most species and strains of staphylococci . the pentaplex pcr was found to be 100% sensitive and specific in detecting 16s rrna genes among staphylococcal strains.

another gene, fema, has been characterized as essential for the expression of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and is universally present only in s. aureus isolates. this gene has been implicated in cell wall metabolism and is present in large amounts in actively growing cultures  <cit> . specific primers for fema were designed and used in the pentaplex pcr to survey various staphylococcal isolates from our culture collection. all  <dig> s. aureus cultures examined, regardless of the presence or absence of meca, produced a positive result in pcr for fema. in contrast to the results with s. aureus, when  <dig> strains of cons were examined for the presence of the fema gene by pentaplex pcr, all were negative. the fema gene in the pentaplex pcr assay was able to rule out non-s. aureus staphylococci, as reported by francois et al.  <cit> .

the meca gene is unique to methicillin-resistant staphylococci  <cit> . the dna sequences of the meca genes found in s. aureus and cons are >99% identical  <cit> . thus, the meca gene represents a useful molecular component for rapid identification of mrsa and methicillin-resistant cons by pcr. one of the  <dig> mssa isolates was shown to be meca-positive by pentaplex pcr. although genotypically the meca gene was detected and confirmed by pcr, it is possible that the meca gene is non-functional  and is not expressed phenotypically or due to the presence of pseudogene  <cit> . clinically, it is important to differentiate between classical type meca-positive mrsa strains among other borderline-resistant s. aureus strains that result from hyperproduction of β-lactamases  <cit> .

the meca-positive isolates were either heterogeneous or homogeneous in their expression of resistance. when heterogeneous isolates are tested by standard conventional methods, some cells appear susceptible and others resistant, while almost all homogeneous isolates express resistance when tested by standard methods  <cit> .

production of pbp-2a may be stimulated during chemotherapy with β-lactam antibiotics, which converts heterogeneous isolates into oxacillin-resistant strains, therefore, the identification of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in the laboratory is complicated by the heterogeneous nature of the resistance, and by the variables that influence its expression   <cit> . for these reasons, detection of meca gene is crucial for precise discrimination of methicillin resistance among staphylococci.

almost 100% of ca-mrsa strains contain the luks gene, compared to <5% of ha-mrsa. the pvl-encoding gene allows the production of a necrotizing cytotoxin, which may be responsible for staphylococcal invasiveness and virulence  <cit> . we included this gene in the pentaplex pcr assay to categorize our isolates and accurately discriminate ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa.

none of the mrsa, mssa and cons isolates harbor the pvl-encoding luks gene. with regard to mrsa, this is not surprising because all mrsa isolates in our study were nosocomial organisms. a high prevalence of luks gene among mssa has been reported in the neighboring countries of singapore and indonesia, with none and low prevalence of luks gene among mrsa  <cit> . the low prevalence in malaysia is ascribed to restrictive antibiotic usage and a strict policy of national surveillance for mrsa.

rapidly increasing prevalence of serious ca-mrsa infections and mortality have been reported globally  <cit> , an accurate and rapid method of screening s. aureus isolates with luks gene was a vital step for appropriate therapy and controlling the dissemination of this potentially virulent pathogen. in malaysia, the presence of mrsa has been reported  <cit> , and cases of mrsa infection and colonization have also been reported in the neighboring countries of singapore and indonesia  <cit> .

the presented pentaplex pcr assay is robust and practicable for culture confirmation purposes. however, the  <dig> cfu/ml analytical sensitivity of this current pentaplex pcr assay might not sensitive enough for the direct testing of clinical specimens.

a previous study by gosbell et al, in  <dig> confirmed that mrsa-screen test gave excellent sensitivity and specificity for mrsa detection, and was quicker and cheaper than pcr  <cit> , while other study showed lower sensitivity and specificity in detecting methicillin resistance in cons  <cit>  and couldn't identify neither pvl toxin encoding gene among staphylococci nor differentiate between ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa. hence the pcr assay developed in the present study will be useful in the epidemiological screening of mrsa patients or carriers. we are currently evaluating this assay for screening for mrsa carriage in malaysia.

CONCLUSIONS
the pcr assay was able to detect four genes that are essential for the identification of s. aureus and its methicillin-resistant genotypes simultaneously in a single test within  <dig> h. the built-in internal control in this assay prevented false-negative results. the diagnostic accuracy was determined using  <dig> clinical specimens and showed  <dig> % of sensitivity and  <dig> % of specificity in detecting methicillin-resistant staphylococci. hence, this test can be used as an effective diagnostic and surveillance tool to monitor the spread and emergence of mrsa.
