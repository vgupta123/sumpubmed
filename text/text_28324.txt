BACKGROUND
eukaryotic chromatin has evolved for seemingly contradictory functions. it ensures compaction and protection of genetic material, but also controls diverse processes including transcription, replication and dna repair that require a relatively open and dynamic chromatin structure. this mixture of robustness and flexibility is achieved by a number of specialized enzymes that remodel chromatin or modify nucleosomes by covalent histone modifications. different chromatin modifications can have a combinatorial effect on chromatin properties and influence each other by guiding, stimulating or inhibiting chromatin modifying enzymes.

one of the best studied examples of an interplay between different types of chromatin modifications is the strong functional relationship between histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. protein domains specialized in specific recognition of acetylated histone tails are often found in chromatin remodeling complexes. acetylation of nucleosomal histones has a strong influence on the action of chromatin remodeling complexes such as rsc  <cit> , swi/snf  <cit> , ino <dig>  <cit>  or swr1-c  <cit> .

in the case of swr1-c, this link seems to go much further. in yeast, the histone variant exchange reaction, catalyzed by swr1-c is stimulated by the nua <dig> complex through acetylation of nucleosomal histones  <cit> . these two protein complexes not only cooperate, but also share interesting structural similarities. each of the two complexes is formed by more than ten different protein subunits organized into modules  <cit> . one of the modules, composed of proteins arp <dig>  swc <dig>  yaf <dig> and monomeric actin, is common to both complexes  <cit> . furthermore, a crucial role in the integrity of nua <dig> and swr1-c is played by proteins eaf <dig> and swr <dig>  respectively, which organize different modules into a functional complex. although eaf <dig> lacks the atpase domain, central to the chromatin remodeling activity of swr1-c, it shares with swr <dig> the hsa domain which is necessary for binding of the common module arp4-swc4-yaf9-actin  <cit> .

in human, homologues of yeast nua <dig> and swr1-c subunits form a hybrid complex called tip60-p <dig>  how far the functions of the fused complexes are conserved is yet to be determined. whereas the atpase activity of p <dig> enables h2a.z deposition through histone exchange  <cit> , the hat activity of the tip <dig> subunit seems to be blocked by the association with p <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, subunit conservation between swr <dig>  nua <dig> and tip60-p <dig> implies a strong evolutionary link. one attractive explanation of the relationship between swr1-c, nua <dig> and tip60-p <dig> points to the fact that the integrity of the three complexes depends on their platform subunits swr <dig>  eaf <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. the complex is formed when the remaining subunits bind, directly or as a part of a protein module, to several conserved features of the platform protein. strikingly, p <dig> combines the features of swr <dig> and eaf <dig>  a synthetic p400-like construct, obtained by insertion of the atpase domain of swr <dig> between the hsa  and sant  domains of eaf <dig>  reconstituted a tip60-p400-like complex when expressed in yeast  <cit> . the authors of the study concluded that a similar rearrangement could have given rise to the p400-like architecture in higher eukaryotes  <cit> .

outside metazoa, the best characterized example of a domain architecture similar to that of p <dig> is pie <dig>  a protein necessary for incorporation of h2a.z into nucleosomes in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . hsa, atpase and sant domains are all present in pie <dig> and show a high degree of sequence similarity to the corresponding domains of p <dig>  although most of the subunits of nua <dig> and swr1-c have clear homologues in arabidopsis, no study has addressed the question of whether pie <dig> can organize these proteins into a hybrid complex similar to tip60-p <dig>  importantly, a plant homologue of eaf <dig> has not been identified so far, which calls into question the existence of an independent nua <dig> complex in plants.

up to now, studies in plants have embraced homologues of only three subunits of the yeast nua <dig> complex, esa <dig>  yaf <dig> and eaf <dig>  esa <dig>  the only essential histone acetyltransferase in s. cerevisiae and the catalytic subunit of the nua <dig> complex  <cit> , has two homologues in a. thaliana, ham <dig>  and ham <dig>  both proteins specifically acetylate lysine  <dig> of the histone h <dig>  <cit>  and are functionally redundant, as the single mutants display no developmental phenotype, while a double mutant is nonviable  <cit> . reduction of ham <dig> and ham <dig> transcript levels results in decreased expression of the negative flowering regulator flowering locus c  and premature transition to flowering. this change is accompanied by a decrease in h <dig> acetylation in the chromatin of flc  <cit> . similar effects were observed in plants deficient in atyaf9a, one of the two arabidopsis homologues of yeast yaf <dig>  a subunit shared by nua <dig> and swr1-c  <cit> . interestingly, a recent study shows that simultaneous loss of function of two a. thaliana homologues of eaf <dig> results in late flowering, also mediated by reduced histone acetylation which, in this case, disrupts the expression of flowering inducer flowering locus t   <cit> .

the aim of this study was to determine whether arabidopsis homologues of nua <dig> subunits are organized into a big protein complex similar to yeast nua <dig> or human tip60-p <dig>  our initial hypothesis was that pie <dig> serves as a platform protein for a plant analog of the human tip60-p <dig> complex. through analysis of proteins that bind to arabidopsis homologues of arp <dig> and swc <dig>  common subunits of yeast nua <dig> and swr1-c, we confirmed their interaction with pie <dig> and other arabidopsis homologues of nua <dig> and swr1-c subunits. in addition, we revealed their association with an uncharacterized eaf1-like protein, not previously considered a subunit of plant nua <dig> or swr1-c. subsequently, we focused on a possible role of ateaf <dig> as a platform of the plant nua <dig> complex. we demonstrated that one of the two isoforms of ateaf <dig> interacts with atyaf9a and atyaf9b through a conserved hsa domain. phenotypical analyses of mutants indicated that ateaf <dig> and atyaf <dig> are necessary for proper timing of transition to flowering, which can be explained by their influence on the h4k <dig> acetylation in the chromatin of major flowering regulator genes and their transcriptional activity, supporting the role of ateaf <dig> as a platform subunit in the plant nua <dig> complex.

RESULTS
an uncharacterized plant-specific domain-relative of the yeast eaf <dig> protein is physically associated with atarp <dig> and atswc4
we used affinity purification followed by tandem mass spectrometry  to test which arabidopsis homologues of yeast nua <dig> and swr1-c are associated with the common protein module of the two complexes. for this purpose we chose arabidopsis homologues of arp <dig> and swc <dig> as protein baits, because these subunits are encoded by single genes in a. thaliana. we overexpressed atarp <dig> and atswc <dig> fused to strep-tag, in an arabidopsis cell suspension culture. following purification of proteins bound to the baits, we identified them by mass spectrometry. proteins detected in control purifications, with no bait or with strep-gfp as bait, were eliminated as nonspecific hits . next, we looked for proteins showing sequence- or domain architecture-similarity to subunits of nua <dig> and swr1-c. we also looked for homologues of ino <dig> complex subunits, because the yeast and human versions of this complex also contain arp <dig>  <cit> . as expected, we found conserved subunits of all three complexes in association with atarp <dig>  while atswc <dig> copurified only with subunits of nua <dig> and swr1-c . in agreement with a recently published study  <cit> , we found multiple subunits of the swi/snf complex among proteins copurified with atarp <dig>  suggesting that besides nua <dig>  swr1-c and ino <dig>  atarp <dig> interacts with swi/snf in plants. we identified no subunits characteristic of ino <dig> or swi/snf among the proteins copurified with atswc <dig>  which additionally confirms the specificity of the detected interactions.table  <dig>

proteins copurified with atarp <dig> or atswc <dig>  fused to strep-tag, were identified by ms/ms and manually annotated on the basis of sequence- and domain architecture-similarity to yeast and human proteins. the table is limited to proteins that were identified as subunits of chromatin remodeling or histone modifying complexes . columns on the right show the distribution of selected protein domains.


 <dig> ,3proteins either directly or indirectly linked to arabidopsis swr <dig> and/or nua <dig> , ino <dig>  or swi/snf-type  complexes, according to published experimental data.



according to published data for other species, the presence of arp <dig> and swc <dig> subunits is restricted to protein complexes closely related to nua <dig>  swr1-c and tip60-p <dig>  therefore, we considered proteins copurified with both baits as potential subunits of a hypothetical plant tip60-p400-like complex . one uncharacterized protein in this category had a domain architecture similar to that of yeast eaf <dig> . we therefore named it ateaf <dig> figure  <dig>

we aligned the amino acid sequences of ateaf <dig> homologues identified in distantly related plant species with the sequences of s. cerevisiae eaf <dig> and its schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue vid <dig>  as well as with human p <dig> and several plant homologues of pie <dig> . strikingly, all proteins contained highly conserved hsa and sant domains , despite little overall sequence similarity and different domain arrangements .

ateaff <dig> is encoded by two nearly identical genes that are both transcriptionally active in a. thaliana
ateaf <dig> is encoded by two genes in all of the sequenced a. thaliana ecotypes, except mt- <dig> . the two genes occupy adjacent loci at3g <dig> and at3g <dig> on the reverse strand of chromosome  <dig> and share  <dig> % identity in their coding regions. as no full-length cdna clone was available for ateaf <dig>  we designed primers using existing annotations , and cloned the full-length coding sequence  . our ateaf1b cds clone corresponds to the at3g <dig>  gene model .

to determine whether both genes were transcriptionally active, we designed three pairs of primers complementary to both coding sequences. each amplicon contained a restriction site specific for one gene . the results of restriction digestion of the rt-pcr products were consistent for all three amplicons and indicated that both transcripts are equally abundant in mature rosette leaves .

plant homologues of the nua <dig> complex subunit yaf <dig> interact with atswc <dig> and ateaf1
as shown above, we found evidence for physical association of atarp <dig> and atswc <dig> with ateaf <dig>  a domain relative of yeast nua <dig> subunit eaf <dig>  we assumed that atarp <dig> and atswc <dig> associated with ateaf <dig> through interaction with the latter’s hsa domain. cooperative binding of arp <dig> and swc <dig> to the n-terminal region of swr <dig>  containing the hsa domain, requires yaf <dig> in yeast  <cit> . one of the two arabidopsis homologues of yaf <dig> was shown recently to be required for histone h <dig> acetylation in the flc locus, in line with its role as a plant nua <dig> subunit  <cit> . to see whether the hsa domain of ateaf <dig> can recruit a. thaliana yaf <dig>  we transiently coexpressed neyfp-tagged atyaf9a or atyaf9b with the hsa-containing fragment of ateaf <dig> fused to the flag-tag in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. coimmunoprecipitation showed that atyaf9a and atyaf9b do indeed interact with this fragment of ateaf <dig> . we also tested hsa-containing fragments of pie <dig> and atino <dig> fused to flag-tag, but no interaction was observed.figure  <dig>

atyaf9a and atyaf9b interact with atswc <dig> in the nucleus
our ap-ms/ms results revealed a physical association of atarp <dig> and atswc <dig> with atyaf9a and atyaf9b. to test whether atarp <dig>  atswc <dig>  atyaf9a and atyaf9b associate closely to form a functional module, we screened these proteins for protein-protein interactions, using bimolecular fluorescence complementation  in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. coexpression of atyaf9a or atyaf9b fused to the n- or c-terminal fragment of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  with atswc <dig> fused to the complementary eyfp fragment produced strong fluorescence localized in the nucleus . no other combination of complementary fusions produced detectable eyfp fluorescence .

although pairwise sequence alignment between atyaf9a and atyaf9b amino acid sequences shows a high degree of similarity along their whole length, only a shorter splice variant of atyaf9b has been studied previously  <cit> . we obtained cds clones of both splice variants  and found that the shorter variant lacks the conserved c-terminal region, responsible for swc <dig> binding in yeast  <cit> . in agreement with this observation, the shorter splice variant of atyaf9b did not interact with atswc <dig> when tested by bifc . therefore, we used the longer splice variant in all protein-protein interaction assays described herein.

ateaf1b, atyaf9a and atyaf9b are necessary for normal flc levels and timing of flowering
atyaf9a-deficient plants express flc at reduced levels  <cit> . physical interaction between atyaf9a and ateaf <dig>  and their similarity to functional counterparts in yeast, yaf <dig> and eaf <dig>  respectively, suggested that ateaf <dig> might also influence flc transcription. to test this prediction we used plants with a t-dna insertion near the 5′ end of the last exon of the ateaf1b gene . we will refer to this line as ateaf1b- <dig>  compared to wild-type seedlings, ateaf1b- <dig> mutants expressed flc at significantly reduced levels under both long day  and short day  conditions .figure  <dig>

in our protein-protein interaction assays both atyaf9a and atyaf9b interacted with atswc <dig> and ateaf <dig> . to investigate whether atyaf9b also contributes to flc expression and whether there is a redundancy of atyaf9a and atyaf9b function, we compared the relative flc expression levels of atyaf9a- <dig>  atyaf9b- <dig> and atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> mutants with wild-type plants using the same experimental setup as described for ateaf1b- <dig> above. interestingly, the flc expression in the double mutant was not significantly reduced when compared to atyaf9a- <dig>  .

a decrease in flc expression leads to earlier transition from vegetative to reproductive phase in the atyaf9a- <dig> mutant  <cit> . we tested the effect of reduced flc expression on the timing of flowering in atyaf9- and ateaf1-deficient plants. we grew atyaf9a- <dig>  atyaf9b- <dig>  atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> and ateaf1b- <dig> mutants, as well as wild type plants, under ld and sd conditions. the atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> double mutant flowered significantly earlier than single mutants under both ld and sd conditions . importantly, both ateaf1b- <dig> and atyaf9a- <dig> mutants flowered at a similar growth stage, which was intermediate between that of the yaf <dig> double mutant and wild-type plants , while the early flowering phenotype of the atyaf9b- <dig> mutant was least pronounced of all the mutant lines .

ateaf <dig> and atyaf <dig> are necessary for normal levels of h4k <dig> acetylation
published experimental data support involvement of arabidopsis homologues of nua <dig> subunits yaf <dig> and esa <dig>  in the acetylation of lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  <cit> . therefore, if ateaf <dig> is a functional subunit of the arabidopsis nua <dig> complex, partial loss of its function should lead to changes in h4k <dig> acetylation levels. as an initial test of the influence of ateaf <dig> on h4k <dig> acetylation, we grew ateaf1b- <dig> and atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> seedlings for 12 days on ms medium supplemented with 1% sucrose or 1% sucrose and  <dig>  μm trichostatin a  . tsa is a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases and has a strong negative effect on plant growth, coinciding with dramatic accumulation of acetylated histones  <cit> . we reasoned that impaired function of an important histone acetylatransferase such as nua <dig> could prevent abnormal accumulation of acetylated histones and give mutant plants an advantage over wt plants under tsa challenge. as expected, average fresh weight of atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> and ateaf1b- <dig> mutant plants grown on plates containing tsa was significantly larger than those of wt plants grown in the same conditions, whereas no significant differences where observed under control conditions . in order to verify if the observed effect can be attributed to differences in global h4k <dig> acetylation levels, we tested the abundance of histone h <dig> acetylated on lysine  <dig> by western blot . only the double mutant atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> displayed decreased levels of acetylated h4k <dig> relative to wt which indicates that the increased resistance of ateaf1b- <dig> plants to tsa cannot be due to a global loss of h4k <dig> acetylation. this observation could be explained if ateaf <dig> had a specialized function in the arabidopsis nua <dig> complex. in fact, in yeast eaf <dig> mutant a strong decrease in histone h <dig> acetylation was observed in the promoter region of the pho <dig> gene, but no decrease in bulk histone h <dig> acetylation was reported  <cit> . therefore we decided to test if specific genomic targets of histone acetyltraferases are affected in plants with impaired function of ateaf <dig>  we focused on major regulators of flowering transition flc, ft, constans  and suppressor of overexpression of constans  <dig>  as histone acetylation in these genes was found to be deregulated by various h <dig> acetylation mutants in previous studies  <cit> . our observations of flowering timing in ateaf1b- <dig> mutant, presented above, further justified that choice.figure  <dig>

in order to verify if the flowering phenotype of the ateaf1b- <dig> mutant is related to the function of ateaf <dig>  we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants in which transcript levels of ateaf1a and ateaf1b genes were reduced simultaneously through artificial micro rna    <cit> . although independent transgenic lines expressing amirna construct displayed a moderate early flowering phenotype , it did not correlate with the decrease in ateaf <dig> transcript , in the line  <dig>  which showed the earliest flowering we detected only slightly decreased levels of ateaf <dig> transcript while line  <dig> , with stronger ateaf <dig> silencing, showed less obvious early flowering phenotype.figure  <dig>

our next step was to characterize differences in histone h4k <dig> acetylation levels over flc and ft genes between wt, ateaf1b- <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> plants by chromatin immunoprecipitation . we carried out the experiments on 10-day old seedlings grown under long day conditions, collected at the end of the day. for the amplification of the dna fragments obtained from chip we used five pairs of pcr primers for each gene, corresponding to various functional elements of the gene . we observed a moderate but consistent decrease in h4k <dig> acetylation over both genes. interestingly, we observed a stronger reduction in acetylation levels near the 5′ end of the genes, especially in the flc locus. following this observation, we tested the acetylation levels in the promoter regions of two other major flowering regulators, co and soc <dig>  we observed a significant and consistent drop of h4k <dig> acetylation in the promoter of co but little change in soc <dig>  except for the atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> line, which showed significantly lower acetylation at both loci .figure  <dig>

examination of the transcript levels of flc, ft, co and soc <dig> genes by rt-qpcr showed their transcriptional deregulation. as expected, in many cases reduction in h4k <dig> acetylation was accompanied by a decreased level of a given transcript . in several cases, however, the observed decrease in acetylation did not result in lower transcript levels. in fact, we observed higher relative levels of ft transcript in the atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> line, despite a significant decrease of h4k <dig> acetylation in the promoter region of ft . the lack of clear correlation between h4k <dig> acetylation and transcriptional activity of tested genes may be at least partially explained by their involvement in a network of functional interactions involving other mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.

discussion
in this study, we have investigated the role of a previously uncharacterized protein ateaf <dig> as a potential subunit of the plant nua <dig> histone acetylatransferase complex. we found that ateaf <dig> and other arabidopsis homologues of nua <dig> subunits copurify with arabidopsis homologues of arp <dig> and swc <dig>  common subunits of the yeast nua <dig> and swr <dig> complexes. our atarp <dig> and atswc <dig> purifications resulted also in detection of peptides belonging to the subunits of the arabidopsis swr <dig> complex including pie <dig>  which recruits subunits responsible for h2a.z deposition in arabidopsis  <cit> . so far, pie <dig> has been the only known plant protein with a potential to physically link atarp <dig> and atswc <dig> with homologues of other swr1-c and nua <dig> subunits. we argue that the identification of ateaf <dig> opens a possibility for a pie1-independent nua <dig> complex formation in plants.

the observed physical association of ateaf <dig> with atapr <dig> and atswc <dig> is best explained by the presence of the hsa domain in ateaf <dig>  hsa domain is a common feature of the platform subunits of swr1-c, nua <dig> and the hybrid complex tip60-p <dig>  several published studies suggest that hsa domain may provide the assembly surface for a submodule consisting of arp <dig>  swc <dig>  yaf <dig> and monomeric actin in nua <dig> and swr <dig> complexes  <cit> . indeed, by coimmunoprecipitation we demonstrated a physical interaction between both arabidopsis yaf <dig> homologues and a fragment of ateaf <dig> containing the hsa domain . formation of a protein module by arabidopsis homologues of arp <dig>  swc <dig> and yaf <dig> is further supported by the interaction of atswc <dig> with atyaf9a and atyaf9b, as revealed by bifc , and by reciprocal copurification of atarp <dig> and atswc <dig>  as shown by ap-ms/ms . interestingly, we were not able to detect the expected interaction between yaf <dig> homologues and the fragment of pie <dig> containing the hsa domain in our coip assay . as yaf <dig> is necessary for h2a.z deposition in yeast  <cit> , it is assumed to be a subunit of the arabidopsis swr1-c. although our coip result alone is not sufficient to question this view, it seems to agree with a relatively mild phenotype of the atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> mutant  as compared to the pie1- <dig> or arp6- <dig> mutant phenotypes  <cit> .

the other conserved sequence feature of ateaf <dig> is the sant domain, located c-terminal of the hsa domain. we found that the combination of hsa and sant domains is usually represented by no more than two genes per eukaryotic genome . for example, in both s. cerevisiae and human there is just single gene that encodes an hsa-sant domain protein, i.e. eaf <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. importantly, ateaf <dig>  unlike p <dig> or pie <dig>  does not contain an atpase domain between the hsa and sant domains. this characteristic leaves eaf <dig> as the most probable functional analogue of ateaf <dig> 

physical interaction of ateaf <dig> with atyaf9a and atyaf9b is consistent with our observation that plants carrying a t-dna insertion in one of the ateaf <dig> genes are phenotypically similar to atyaf9a- <dig> mutants. it has been shown recently that atyaf9a- <dig> mutants display reduced levels of h <dig> acetylation in flc gene chromatin  <cit> , which leads to a decrease in flc transcript levels and, consequently, partial loss of flowering inhibition. although the double mutant ateaf1a ateaf1b is not currently available, our results show that the single mutant ateaf1b- <dig> is affected in flc expression and flowering time under ld and sd conditions , phenocopying atyaf9a- <dig> 

we demonstrated that ateaf <dig> and swc <dig> interact with both arabidopsis homologues of yaf <dig>  if the influence of atyaf9a on flc expression results from its interaction with ateaf <dig>  the same could be true for atyaf9b. functional redundancy of atyaf9a and atyaf9b has been suggested previously on the basis of the phenotype of atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b-kd plants, which differs from the phenotype of either atyaf9a- <dig> or atyaf9b-kd plants  <cit> . our own data show that a double mutant, carrying t-dna insertions in both yaf <dig> genes, displays stronger deregulation of flowering time control than either of the single mutants . this result suggests some level of functional redundancy between the two genes in the arabidopsis nua <dig> complex and is in agreement with our finding that both proteins interact with ateaf1b.

our analyses of the influence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor tsa revealed an increased resistance to this hyperacetylation-inducing agent in atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> and ateaf1b- <dig> mutant seedlings. this result supports a role for atyaf9a, atya9b and ateaf1b in histone acetylation. under tsa treatment atyaf9a- <dig> atyaf9b- <dig> accumulated less acetylated h4k <dig> than wt plants  which may explain its increased resistance to the drug. no such effect was observed for ateafb- <dig> mutant. several explanations of this result are possible. we chose to follow a hypothesis that ateaf <dig> is only required for h4k <dig> acetylation in specific genomic targets, similar to yeast eaf <dig> which is mainly required for the nua <dig> activity in the promoter regions  <cit> .

as we were not able to determine which genes may be relevant to the negative effect of tsa on plant growth, we used genes encoding main flowering regulators as models to study the role of ateaf <dig> in arabidopsis nua <dig>  chip experiment, in which we employed artificial mirna knock-down lines for ateaf <dig> gene showed that decreased levels of ateaf <dig> transcript have similar effect on histone h4k <dig> acetylation as the disruption of one of the ateaf <dig> isoforms in the ateaf1b- <dig> mutant . as expected, we observed a general decrease in h4k <dig> acetylation levels over most of the tested regions of flc and ft loci with a slight bias towards their 5′ end . we could also detect significant decrease in acetylation in the promoter of the co gene and a weaker effect in the soc <dig> gene .

the gene-specific effects which we observed at the level of histone acetylation were not evenly reflected in the transcript levels of the studied genes. this can be at least in part attributed to the functional interactions between flc, ft, co, soc <dig> and multiple other genes involved in the control of flowering transition. partial loss of nua <dig> activity likely affects many genes with diverse functions. put to such a stress, the system of positive and negative flowering regulators may seek new balance with outcomes that are difficult to predict. another possible explanation of these results comes from a recent study on plant homologues of the nua <dig> subunit eaf <dig>  i.e. mrg <dig> and mrg <dig>  in contrast to previous reports showing that arabidopsis homologues of nua <dig> subunits yaf <dig> and esa <dig> contribute to flowering time control mainly by ensuring proper levels of the negative flowering regulator flc, xu et al. demonstrated that transcriptional activity of the positive flowering regulator ft also depends on h4k <dig> acetylation  <cit> . according to the report, mrg proteins act as h3k36me <dig> readers and guide ham <dig> and ham <dig> acetyltraferases through a direct protein-protein interaction. this does not exclude a role for other nua <dig> subunits as in the case of the yeast nua <dig> complex or human tip60-p <dig> which incorporate mrg homologues as stable subunits  <cit> . in fact, mrg <dig> was among the nua <dig> subunits identified as atswc <dig> interaction partners in our ap-ms/ms analyses . conservation of the ateaf <dig> role as a bridge between functional submodules of nua <dig> containing yaf <dig> and eaf <dig> homologues would explain the ambivalent effects of its partial loss that we observe.

CONCLUSIONS
our work introduces ateaf <dig> as a new subunit of the arabidopsis nua <dig> complex. characteristic sequence features, interaction with the atyaf9-atswc4-atarp <dig> submodule and influence on h4k <dig> acetylation suggest that ateaf <dig> may be a functional analog of the yeast eaf <dig> protein. judging from previous studies on human and yeast models, elucidation of the exact role of ateaf <dig> subunit in the structural integrity and function of the arabidopsis nua <dig> complex will require significant effort. our data do not exclude the existence of another large hat complex in arabidopsis, organized around pie <dig>  with additional h2a.z exchange activity. addressing this problem may also be required to better understand the regulation of histone h <dig> acetylation in plants.
