BACKGROUND
type i diabetes  is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by the specific
destruction of pancreatic β-cells, which produce insulin  <cit> , multiple complications are usually associated
with diabetes mellitus  <cit> . impaired wound
healing represents a severe complication of the disease, which could diminish
physical activity and lead to chronic wounds and limb amputation  <cit> . previous studies have reported that wound
healing involves a complex series of interactions between different cell types,
cytokine mediators, and the extracellular matrix. the phases of normal wound healing
include hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling  <cit> . moreover, many factors that can affect wound
healing interfere with one or more phases in this process, thus causing improper or
impaired tissue repair. for instance, collagen deposition in acute wounds is
impaired in t1d; possibly due to a decreased fibroblast proliferation  <cit> . the capacity of a wound to heal depends in part
on its depth, as well as on the overall health and nutritional status of the
individual  <cit> . cytokines such as il-1α,
il-1β, il- <dig>  and tnf-α are thought to play important roles in wound
repair, including the stimulation of keratinocyte and fibroblast proliferation, the
synthesis and breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins, fibroblast chemotaxis, and
immune response regulation  <cit> . diabetic
individuals are more susceptible to both wound infection and hyper-inflammation,
which cannot be pathogenically separated from the elevated levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, tnf-α dysregulation in mouse model of
diabetic wounds impairs healing, which may involve the enhanced apoptosis and
decreased proliferation of fibroblasts  <cit> .
moreover, overexpression of il- <dig>  an anti-inflammatory cytokine, decreases the
inflammatory response to injury, creating an environment conducive for regenerative
adult wound healing  <cit> . several chemokines
that have been identified as regulators of specific leukocyte accumulation at wound
sites  <cit> , such as macrophage inflammatory
proteins 1α and  <dig> , are major chemoattractants for
monocytes/macrophages and play key roles in macrophage infiltration during wound
healing  <cit> . in particular,
keratinocyte-derived chemokine  and mip- <dig> are believed to participate in the
recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation in many tissues  <cit> . cx3cl <dig> is expressed as a soluble chemokine
and as a membrane-bound form on the surface of inflamed endothelial cells,
epithelial cells, macrophages, and vascular smooth muscle cells. the chemokine
cx3cl <dig> and its receptor cx3cr <dig> are both highly induced at wound sites and mediate
skin wound healing by promoting macrophage and fibroblast accumulation and function
 <cit> . although cx3cl <dig> directly
stimulates angiogenesis, the local microvasculature also depends on several other
growth factors, including transforming growth factor-β , which is
produced by macrophages in wounds  <cit>  and
functions in leukocyte chemotaxis, fibroblast and smooth muscle cell mitogenesis and
extracellular matrix deposition during granulation tissue formation  <cit> .

protein is essential for the maintenance and repair of body tissue. depleted protein
levels cause a decrease in collagen development, slowing the wound healing process.
adequate protein levels help to achieve optimal wound healing rates  <cit> . camel whey proteins  are composed of a
heterogeneous group of proteins that include serum albumin, α lactalbumin,
immunoglobulin, lactophorin and peptidoglycan recognition protein  <cit> . dietary whey supplementation is thought to
increase glutathione synthesis and cellular antioxidant defense  <cit> . therefore, wp may be a therapeutic tool for
oxidative stress-associated diseases  <cit> .
in addition to its immunomodulatory properties and its ability to boost the host
defense systems  <cit> , wp fractions are
linked to a range of bioactive functions, such as prebiotic effects, the promotion
of tissue repair, the maintenance of intestinal integrity, the destruction of
pathogens and the elimination of toxins  <cit> . in addition, a clear modulation of immune functions by several
whey protein-derived products has been demonstrated in vitro and in
vivo <cit> . our recent published
study revealed that the supplementation of diabetic mice with wp rescued functional,
long-lived wound-resident macrophages and improved the healing and closure of
diabetic wounds  <cit> . additionally, it was
found that dietary supplementation with wp enhances the normal inflammatory
responses during wound healing in diabetic mice by restoring the levels of oxidative
stress and inflammatory cytokines  <cit> .
recent studies have shown that whey increases antioxidant activity in the body,
combats fatigue and inflammation, hastens healing, improves stamina and may
discourage related infections because of the immune system-enhancing and natural
antibiotic properties of its components  <cit> . nevertheless, there are few studies that have
investigated the influence of wps in wound healing. the aim of this study was to
investigate the potential modulatory effects of the oral administration of wps on
wound healing using a diabetic mouse model.

methods
preparation of whey proteins
raw camel milk was collected from healthy female camels  from the
riyadh area in saudi arabia. the milk was then centrifuged to remove the cream.
the obtained skim milk was acidified to ph  <dig>  using 1 n hcl at room
temperature and centrifuged at  <dig>  x g for 10 min to
precipitate the casein. the resulting whey, which contained the whey proteins,
was saturated with ammonium sulfate to a final saturation of 80% to precipitate
the whey proteins. the precipitated whey proteins were dialyzed against 20
volumes of distilled water for 48 hr using a molecular porous membrane
with a molecular weight cutoff of  <dig> - <dig>  kda. the dialysate
containing undenatured whey proteins was lyophilized and refrigerated until
use.

chemicals
streptozotocin  was obtained from sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa.
stz was dissolved in cold  <dig>  m citrate buffer  and was always
freshly prepared for immediate use .

animals and experimental design
a total of  <dig> sexually mature, 12-week-old male swiss webster  mice, each
weighing 25-30 g, were obtained from the central animal house of the
faculty of pharmacy at king saud university. all animal procedures were
conducted in accordance with the standards set forth in the guidelines for the
care and use of experimental animals by the committee for the purpose of control
and supervision of experiments on animals . the study protocol was
approved by the animal ethics committee of the zoology department, college of
science, king saud university according to the helsinki principles. all animals
were allowed to acclimate to the metal cages inside a well-ventilated room for
2 weeks prior to experimentation. animals were maintained under standard
laboratory conditions , fed a diet of standard commercial pellets and
given water ad libitum. all mice were fasted for 20 hr prior to diabetes
induction. mice  were rendered diabetic with an
intraperitoneal injection  of a single dose of stz  in  <dig>  m citrate buffer   <cit> . blood glucose levels were measured  <dig> consecutive
days after stz injection by cutting off the tip of the tail, squeezing it gently
and using onetouch ultra . mice were considered
diabetic if glycemia was higher than 220 mg/dl with monitoring initial and
final glycemia during wound healing period . mice in the control
group  were injected with the vehicle alone
. the animals were divided into three
experimental groups: group  <dig>  control non-diabetic mice that were orally
supplemented with distilled water ; group  <dig>  diabetic mice that were orally supplemented with
distilled water ; and
group  <dig>  diabetic mice orally supplemented with undenatured wp .
therefore, the supplemented volume for the  <dig> groups was constant and did not
exceed 250 μl per dosage. the optimal dose of wp was determined in
our laboratory on the basis of the ld <dig> and several established
parameters.

excisional wound preparation and macroscopic examination
following diabetes induction, mice in each group  were
wounded at the age of 12 weeks. wounded mice in each group
 were divided into two subgroups . ten mice were used for the data presented in this study and the other
 <dig> animals from each group were used for the measurement of hydroxyproline
content in the wound sites. after drying for 24 h at 120 °c,
the amount of hydroxyproline, a major constituent of collagen in skin wound
sites, was measured to index collagen accumulation at the wound site. all the
diabetic animals in the diabetic group  and in the
wp-treated diabetic group  were all responded to stz and
diabetes induction was confirmed by monitoring the blood glucose levels
throughout the experiment period. wounding of mice was performed as described
previously  <cit> . briefly, mice were
anesthetized with a single i.p. injection of ketamine  and xylazine . blood samples were
immediately collected from orbital sinus in a non-heparinized tube and
centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm to separate the serum, then
stored at 80 °c and later used to biochemical analyses. the hair on
the back of each mouse was cut, and the back was subsequently cleansed with 70%
ethanol. six full-thickness wounds 
were made on the back of each mouse by excising the skin and the underlying
panniculus carnosus. the wounds were allowed to form a scab.

wound closure measurement
skin biopsy specimens were obtained from the animals at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and
13 days post-injury. at each time point, an area that included the scab,
the complete epithelial and dermal compartments of the wound margins, the
granulation tissue, and parts of the adjacent muscle and subcutaneous fat tissue
was excised from each individual wound. occasionally, a similar amount of skin
was taken from the backs of non-wounded normal mice as a control. each wound
site was photographed by single camera digital photogrammetry  at the
indicated time intervals to determine the wound areas. the wound area was
determined by wound measurement software . total surface area yet to be healed was calculated by the
principal investigator who was blinded to group assignment. changes in wound
area are expressed as the percentage of the initial wound area. at the indicated
time points, tissue from two wounds from each of ten animals  was harvested for rna analysis, rt-pcr.

blood analysis
blood glucose levels were determined using the accutrend sensor . serum insulin levels were analyzed by luminex
 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

biochemical analysis of wound tissue
analysis of wound tissue cytokine levels
wound tissues from  <dig> mice/group were pulverized under liquid nitrogen
followed by the extraction of protein as described  <cit> . the levels of il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and
tnf-α in tissue extracts were measured using commercially available
elisa kits  according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

extraction of total rna and rt-pcr
total rna was isolated from wounded skin samples  using trizol
reagent  according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. before reverse transcription, rna was treated
with rnase-free dnase i following the manufacturer’s protocol. cdna was
synthesized from 3 μg of total rna using a superscript iii rt kit
. unique primer sets for mouse
mip-1α, mip- <dig>  kc, cx3cl <dig>  tgf-β <dig> and β-actin were designed
 based on sequences deposited with the
national center for biotechnology information and were synthesized by invitrogen
life technologies. pcr was performed using 1 μl of cdna in a reaction
mix with taq polymerase . pcr was found
to be linear between  <dig> and  <dig> cycles, and pcr conditions were optimized to
allow for a semiquantitative comparison of results. bands separated on ethidium
bromide-stained agarose gels were quantitated from digital images using nih
image analysis software. the intensity of each product was normalized to the
intensity of the β-actin product and expressed relative to the levels in
injured skin from control non-diabetic mice.

variances homogeneity prior to any further statistical analysis. data were
normally distributed and were expressed as the mean ± standard
error of the mean . significant differences among groups were analyzed
using a one- or two-way anova followed by bonferroni’s multiple comparison
tests using prism statistical analysis software  and data was
reanalyzed using a one- or two-way anova followed by tukey’s post-test

RESULTS
administration of camel wp expedites wound closure in diabetic mice
we evaluated the macroscopic changes at skin-excision wound sites in control
mice, diabetic mice and diabetic mice supplemented with wp. pictures were taken
on day  <dig> immediately after the injury. the wound sites exhibited a similar
morphology in all  <dig> experimental groups on day  <dig> post-injury, and the wounds in
the control and diabetic mice supplemented with wp were similarly closed at
13 days post-injury. by contrast, the diabetic mice exhibited delayed
wound closure. changes in the diameters of wounded area throughout the
experiment period were monitored in the  <dig> groups. accumulated data from 10
individual mice in each group is expressed as the mean percentage of wound
closure ± sem at each time point figure  <dig>  these results demonstrate that wound closure and healing were
accelerated in the diabetic mice supplemented with camel wp compared with
untreated diabetic mice, which exhibited delayed wound closure. to optimize the
parameters and conditions of the animal models during the experiments, blood
glucose and insulin levels in the  <dig> groups of mice were monitored before and
throughout the indicated time points post-injury . glucose levels in the wp-treated diabetic group were
significantly lower than in the diabetic group and were higher than in the
control group. by contrast, insulin levels were significantly increased in the
wp-treated diabetic group compared with diabetic mice throughout the wound
healing period.

wp supplementation during diabetes restores the levels of wound tissue
cytokines
cytokines are secreted by specific immune cells, carry signals locally between
cells and are critical for the wound healing process. therefore, we monitored
the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that control immune cell
function during wound healing in the three groups of mice. data from 10
individual mice from each group are shown in figure  <dig>  we observed that the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines
 peaked at 4 days post-injury. in
diabetic mice, we observed aberrant and significantly elevated levels of
tnf-α, il-1β and il- <dig> compared with control and wp-treated diabetic
mice from  <dig> to 13 days post-injury, which indicates a prolonged
pro-inflammatory phase during the healing of diabetic wounds. by contrast, the
level of il- <dig> was significantly reduced in diabetic mice compared with control
and wp-treated diabetic mice at the same time points. thus, wp supplementation
during diabetes significantly restored the levels of tnf-α, il-1β,
il- <dig> and il- <dig> 
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and an anti-inflammatory cytokine  were measured by elisa in the
wound tissues from the  <dig> groups of mice before wounding  and on
the indicated days post-wounding. the results are expressed as the

the effects of wp supplementation on the expression of wound tissue
chemokines and tgf-β
the expression levels of chemokines and growth factors, which play important
roles in the process of wound healing, were measured by rt-pcr. excisional wound
tissues were collected from the  <dig> groups of mice on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 13
post-injury. one representative experiment is shown for the expression of each
mip-1α, mip- <dig>  kc and tgf-β  and accumulated data in the bar graphs for each

from  <dig> individual mice from each group reveal that the levels of mip-1α,
mip- <dig> and kc were significantly elevated for a prolonged period in the wound
tissue of diabetic mice compared with control mice. wp-treated diabetic mice
exhibited partially restored chemokine levels in wound tissue compared with
control and diabetic mice .
similarly, the expression of tgf-β peaked at 4 days post-injury, and
in wp-supplemented diabetic mice, tgf-β levels were significantly
decreased, especially at days  <dig> and  <dig> post-injury, when compared with diabetic
mice . by contrast, the levels of cx3cl1
were significantly reduced in diabetic mice when compared with control mice, and
supplementation with wp partially restored these levels in diabetic mice

discussion
although it seems that the role of nutrition is well established in immune system
functions and inflammatory diseases, little is known about the role of nutritional
status in normal physiological processes, such as cutaneous wound healing
 <cit> . impaired wound healing in
diabetic patients represents a severe complication of the disease and, more
important, is an ongoing medical problem associated with significant mortality
 <cit> . therefore, several attempts
have been made to understand the underlying defects in wound healing. in this study,
we monitored the macroscopic changes and percentage of wound closure, which reflect
the effects of wound contraction and healing. we observed that macroscopic changes
and the rate of wound closure were significantly enhanced in diabetic mice
supplemented with wp when compared with untreated diabetic mice. the accelerated
closure of wp-treated diabetic wounds may be attributed to increased glutathione
synthesis and cellular antioxidant defense  <cit> . data obtained during the optimization of the parameters
and conditions of the animal models during our investigation revealed that delayed
wound repair in diabetic mice was associated with a significant increase in blood
glucose levels and an obvious decrease in insulin levels, both of which were
reversed by wp supplementation. similarly, the addition of whey to meals has been
observed to stimulate insulin release and reduce postprandial blood glucose
excursion after a lunch meal consisting of mashed potatoes and meatballs in type 2
diabetic subjects  <cit> . interestingly, we
observed that wp treatment significantly decreased the elevated levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines  and increased il- <dig> in
plasma and wound tissue. thus, wp limits prolonged inflammation, and these data
elucidate the mechanism underlying the enhanced immune response and may be a cause
for improving wound healing in wp-treated diabetic mice. these results are in
agreement with those obtained by peranteau et al.,  <cit>  who reported that overexpression of il- <dig>  an
anti-inflammatory cytokine, decreased the inflammatory response to injury, creating
an environment conducive for regenerative adult wound healing. in addition, a
previous study that supports our results demonstrated that lactoferrin can regulate
the levels of tnf-α and il- <dig>  which would decrease inflammation and mortality
 <cit> . several studies have focused
on the critical roles of chemokines, such as mip-1α, mip <dig>  and kc, during
tissue repair processes  <cit> . in the present study, treatment of diabetic mice with wp
may exert different effects that obviously increased the expression of mip-1α,
mip <dig>  and kc, and these effects may be participate in accelerating healing of
diabetic wounds. mori et al.,  <cit>  similarly
demonstrated that several chemokines, such as mip-1α and mip <dig>  have chemotactic
activities toward neutrophils and macrophages and that their expression can be
upregulated by other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il-1β. tgf-β
plays an important role in wound repair by adding signals important for the
initiation of the healing cascade and by attracting macrophages and stimulating them
to secrete additional cytokines, including fibroblast growth factor ,
platelet-derived growth factor , tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> . we also observed that wp treatment during diabetes
decreased the expression of tgf-β in the wounded area and may be in turn
promoting wound healing. previous studies have demonstrated improvements in wound
healing by altering growth factor and collagen expression  <cit> . cx3cl <dig> also contributes to wound healing by recruiting
macrophages. in this study, impaired wound healing in diabetic mice was accompanied
by a significant decrease in the levels of cx3cl <dig>  which was partially restored by
wp supplementation. wp-induced cx3cl <dig> enhances phagocytosis and the immune response;
thus, wp may be a promising drug candidate for immunomodulation in chronic diabetic
wounds. this study suggests that the oral administration of camel wp may be a new
avenue for the treatment of skin wounds in diabetic patients.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the data presented in this study expand our knowledge of the benefits
of wp supplementation in improving the healing and closure of diabetic wounds,
suggesting that wp may be a promising drug candidate for treating diabetic wounds
and their associated complications.
