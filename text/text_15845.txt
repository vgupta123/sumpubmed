BACKGROUND
phosphorus  is a major essential nutrient for plant growth, development and reproduction. plants acquire p from the soil in its most oxidized inorganic form, phosphate   <cit> . the uptake of pi into the plant occurs against a steep electrochemical gradient. while the concentration of pi in the soil solution is generally less than 2 μm, the pi concentrations within plant tissues can be greater than 10 mm  <cit> . however, cytosolic pi concentrations are tightly controlled, rarely exceeding 60–80 μm pi  <cit> . pi uptake from the soil and transport within the plant against this concentration gradient is mediated by pi transporters. the first eukaryotic pi transporter protein to be described was the pho84p h+ : pi symporter in yeast  <cit> , followed by plant homologs  <cit> . from the numerous plant sequences now available, four phosphate transporter  families are recognised: pht <dig> , pht <dig> , pht <dig>  and pht <dig>   <cit> .

the arabidopsis atpht <dig> family has nine members. the family is composed of several high-affinity pi transporters having km values in the range of  <dig>  μm to  <dig>  μm  <cit>  and other members that may have lower affinities for pi  <cit> . transcripts from most of the atpht <dig> genes are detected in both roots and shoots  <cit> , while atpht1; <dig> transcripts are most abundant in flowers  <cit> . transcripts from all atpht <dig> genes except atpht1; <dig> accumulate upon pi starvation  <cit> . transcriptional regulation of atpht <dig> expression seems to be mainly controlled by the internal p status  <cit> . sugars and cytokinins can also direct the expression of some atpht <dig> family members  <cit> .

several strategies have evolved in plants that help them acclimate to variation in pi availability, including the modulation of pht <dig> gene expression. the deployment of these strategies is modulated by local and systemic signaling networks. the best characterized systemic signaling module involved in the responses to changes in pi supply includes the phloem-mobile microrna atmir399d, its target gene atpho <dig> and a family of regulatory, non-coding rnas encoded by the atips <dig> and atat <dig> genes  <cit> . these functions form a circuit where atpho <dig> activity in the root, which mediates the ubiquitination of atpht <dig> proteins in the post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment  <cit> , is modulated by atmir399d as the shoot experiences variations in p levels  <cit> . the activity of atmir399d in silencing atpho <dig> transcripts is itself antagonistically modulated by atips <dig> and atat <dig> transcripts during prolonged periods of pi starvation  <cit> . on the other hand, local signaling networks control many of the characteristic changes in root system architecture that accompany changes in pi availability. thibaud et al.  <cit>  identified a set of genes that are induced by local signaling networks during pi starvation. these genes include the ethylene-responsive aterf <dig> transcription factor gene, the metalloproteinase at2-mmp gene, the jasmonate-inducible atgstu <dig> and atlox <dig> genes and the atwrky <dig> transcription factor gene, which encodes a modulator of both the pi-starvation response and root development  <cit> .

functional characterization of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> validated their roles in pi acquisition from the soil solution under both pi-sufficient and pi-deficient growth conditions  <cit> . atpht1; <dig> plays a role in translocating pi from source to sink organs  <cit> . analysis of a atpht1;9– <dig> mutant and pht1;8/pht1; <dig> silencing lines suggested a role for atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> in pi acquisition at the root-soil interface during prolonged pi limitation  <cit> . however, based on the increased transcript abundance from these two atpht <dig> genes in the pho <dig> mutant  <cit> , we hypothesize that atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> each have a role in translocating pi from the root to the shoot. in this study we examined the physiological functions of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> by characterizing their transcriptional regulation and the phenotypes of corresponding t-dna insertion mutants in response to changes in pi supply. genetic interactions within the atpht <dig> gene family were also examined by analyzing the transcript patterns of its members in each mutant in response to pi availability. furthermore, the placement of these two atpht <dig> gene functions within the plant response to variations in pi supply was determined by analyzing the transcript patterns of several genes associated with systemic and local signaling networks in each mutant.

RESULTS
transcripts from individual atpht <dig> genes responded differentially to pi deprivation and re-supply
the remodeling kinetics of the atpht <dig> transcript pool in response to both p depletion and pi re-supply were examined in well-established arabidopsis plants prior to inflorescence emergence. in this and the following experiments, whenever pi was supplied, the supply was set to be sufficient for non-limited growth, without being luxuriant. wild-type  plants were grown hydroponically and then deprived of pi for 12 days until the leaves began to accumulate anthocyanins , a visible indication that the tissues were beginning to experience p depletion. at this time, plants were transferred to nutrient solution containing either no added pi  or added pi . quantitative pcr  was used to measure transcript abundance for eight of the nine members of the atpht <dig> gene family in root and shoot tissues over the next three days . atpht1; <dig> was excluded from the analysis because of its low transcript abundance in roots and shoots  <cit> . transcript abundance was normalized to the average transcript abundance for a set of reference genes  <cit> . to conservatively identify genes whose transcript patterns changed with pi availability, only differences in the 40-Δct value of greater than two were considered, corresponding to a four-fold difference in transcript abundance  <cit> .figure  <dig>

in arabidopsis roots, p depletion by growth in the absence of a pi supply for  <dig> d resulted in a four-fold to 16-fold greater transcript abundance for all the atpht <dig> genes tested , except for atpht1; <dig>  when compared to control plants continuously supplied with pi . this is in general agreement with what has previously been observed  <cit> . the abundance of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> transcripts were eight-fold higher after  <dig> d pi depletion compared to the control plants, but the abundance of these transcripts was lower at d <dig> and d <dig>  being indistinguishable in abundance to these transcripts in the control plants under continuous pi supply.

after  <dig> d of pi re-supply to pi-deprived plants, transcript abundance for most of the atpht <dig> genes tested in roots was similar to that in the control plants . the exceptions were atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig>  the repression of atpht <dig> transcript abundance by day  <dig> of pi re-supply was generally stronger than after day  <dig>  transcripts from atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> were repressed to their lowest levels at this time point. transcripts from atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> were repressed to their lowest levels at day  <dig> of pi re-supply . interestingly,  <dig> d of pi re-supply repressed the abundance of atpht <dig> transcripts to levels below those present in control plants that had been continuously supplied with pi for the entire experiment even though the root pi concentration was the same as in the control plants .

the general trends of transcript accumulation in the shoots of pi-deprived plants were similar to those found in the roots , except for atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig>  where transcript abundance remained constant and similar to the control plants. in contrast to roots,  <dig> d of pi re-supply did not cause a decrease in the abundance of any atpht <dig> transcripts compared to pi-deprived plants of the same age. interestingly, the transcript abundance for atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> was actually higher after  <dig> d of pi resupply than in the pi-deprived plants of the same age. the transcript amount for most of the atpht <dig> genes did eventually become repressed; however, the repression was not as strong as in roots, despite the fact that these plants had twice the shoot pi concentration of the control plants .

cluster analysis showed that the transcript responses to changes in pi supply for the main atpht <dig> transporter genes, atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig>  along with atpht1; <dig>  were distinct from those of the other atpht <dig> genes in both roots and shoots . in roots, the response patterns for atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> were similar to each other, while the responses of atpht1; <dig> were most similar to those of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig>  in the shoot, the response patterns for atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> clustered with those of atpht1; <dig>  while the pattern of changes for atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> clustered discretely.figure  <dig>

disruption of atpht1; <dig> or atpht1; <dig> had diverse effects in arabidopsis seedlings
there is only a single mutant available for each atpht <dig>  and atpht1; <dig> that has a predicted t-dna insertion in the exon region. pcr across the predicted t-dna left-border  insertion sites and sequencing of the pcr products confirmed that the putative atpht1;1- <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> mutants used in this study were homozygous for the presence of t-dna at sites expected to disrupt gene function . at least two t-dnas have been inserted in a head-to-head orientation in all three mutants. in atpht1;1– <dig>  two t-dnas were inserted 42 bp downstream of the start of exon  <dig>  confirming previous results   <cit> . in the atpht1; <dig> mutant, the t-dnas were located 595 bp downstream of the start of exon  <dig> . the insertion site in the previously characterised atpht1;9– <dig> mutant allele  <cit>  was found to be located 77 bp upstream of the start codon in exon  <dig> . these insertions caused the amount of the corresponding transcript for each mutant gene to be severely reduced to below the limit of detection by semi-qpcr and just above the limit of detection by qpcr .

the disruption of atpht1; <dig> or atpht1; <dig> gene function did not cause gross morphological changes in 17-day-old mutant seedlings supplied with sufficient pi or depleted of pi . the most striking visible phenotype in both mutants supplied with sufficient pi was a 20% to 30% reduction in root-to-shoot ratio compared to the corresponding col- <dig> wt . this was brought about by a 10% greater shoot biomass combined with a 10% lower root biomass in the mutants . the decreased root biomass in the p-sufficient atpht1; <dig> mutant was at least partly due to a lower primary root length , although the lateral roots also tended to be shorter in both mutants . when depleted of p, the root system biomass of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> seedlings was not significantly different from the wt . the pi concentration in the roots of the mutants was also the same as that in wt , but it was 20% lower in the mutant compared to wt shoots . the lower shoot pi concentration might be expected to enhance p-starvation responses such as anthocyanin production which was indeed the case in the atpht1; <dig> mutant . by contrast, the anthocyanin concentration in the shoots of atpht1;9– <dig> seedlings depleted of p was only about half of that in the wt. this lower anthocyanin concentration was not due to a dilution by growth, as shoot biomass in atpht1;9- <dig> seedlings depleted of p was about 10% less than that of wt seedlings .figure  <dig>

disruption of atpht1; <dig> or atpht1; <dig> compromised root-to-shoot translocation of pi
forty-eight-day-old atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> plants depleted of p were assessed for their short-term ability to remove pi from the external nutrient solution in comparison to the wt and to the atpht1;1– <dig> mutant . as expected, the atpht1;1– <dig> mutation caused a significantly lower rate of pi removal from the nutrient solution than wt . however, the atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> mutations had a negligible effect on the ability of p-depleted plants to remove pi from the nutrient solution. moreover, the atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9- <dig> mutants were clearly distinguished from both wt and atpht1;1– <dig> in the short-term kinetics of pi accumulation in the roots and shoots of these p-depleted plants upon pi re-supply . the atpht1;1– <dig> mutant, although compromised in its ability to acquire pi from the nutrient solution , had a root pi concentrations similar to that of wt . the concentration of pi tended to be somewhat higher in the roots of atpht1; <dig> than in wt throughout the time course, while the pi concentration in the roots of atpht1;9– <dig> tended to be marginally lower than in wt. after 300 min of pi re-supply to the pi-deprived plants, the roots of the atpht1; <dig> mutant had a significantly higher pi concentration than those of wt, while the roots of atpht1;9– <dig> were indistinguishable from those of wt.table  <dig>

plants grown in hydroponics. accumulation of pi in roots  and shoots  of wt and pht <dig> mutant plants over a 6-hour time course. seedlings were grown in nutrient solution containing 250 μm pi for  <dig> d, transferred to solution without pi for  <dig> d to deplete plant p pools, and then transferred to solutions containing 250 μm pi. tissues were harvested every  <dig> mins for 6 h after the last transfer. values are means ± s.d. . error bars have been excluded for clarity, and can be viewed in additional file 7: figure s <dig> 



in sharp contrast to the roots, the shoots of all three p-depleted mutants accumulated dramatically less pi than wt during short-term pi re-supply . the atpht1;1– <dig> mutant had noticeably lower shoot pi concentrations than wt at all time points from 150 min onwards, as might be expected from the decreased ability of this mutant to remove pi from the nutrient solution. however, both atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> plants, which were not compromised in acquiring pi from the nutrient solution, accumulated much less of the added pi in their shoots than either wt or the atpht1;1– <dig> mutant. after 300-min exposure to pi, the shoot pi concentration in both atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> mutants was less than half of that in wt and 40% lower than in the atpht1;1– <dig> mutant that was impaired in the primary uptake of pi .

the longer-term impact of the atpht1;1– <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> mutations on plant p pools was determined in 30-day-old plants grown in the presence of pi and then deprived or not of pi for  <dig> d . for atpht1;1– <dig> plants with their compromised pi uptake capacity , the long-term total p concentration was lower than in wt in both roots and shoots of plants grown at either pi supply. this lower total p concentration was due to lower concentrations of both pi and the p esterified into acid-hydrolyzable organic compounds . the po was 35% lower in the root and 25% lower in the shoot compared to the wt regardless of the pi supply, while the pi concentration was only lower than wt in atpht1;1– <dig> roots and shoots under pi-sufficient conditions. on the other hand, the long-term pi concentration in the root and the shoot of the atpht1; <dig> mutant was indistinguishable from wt and atpht1;9– <dig> in both pi-sufficient and pi-limited conditions. the pi concentration was also similar to atpht1;1– <dig> but in pi-limited condition only. the total p concentration in roots of the atpht1; <dig> mutant was identical to the wt regardless of pi supply, while in the shoots the total p concentration was lower and similar to that of the atpht1;1– <dig> mutant. this difference in root, but not shoot, total p concentration between these two mutants highlights a fundamental difference between them; the lower shoot p in atph1; <dig> compared to wt was not due to a lower p concentration in the root, as may have been the case in atpht1;1– <dig>  which is impaired in pi uptake. in the roots of pi-sufficient atpht1;9– <dig> plants, the pi concentrations were similar to those in the atpht1; <dig> mutant, while the po concentrations were similar to those in the atpht1;1– <dig> mutant. however, in the shoots of these plants, both pi and po concentrations were similar to those of atpht1; <dig>  indicating that atpht1; <dig> only differs from atpht1; <dig> in its ability to allocate pi to po in the roots. this difference was also observed in pi-deficient plants .figure  <dig>

loss of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> influenced the transcript profiles of other genes repressed by pi
a panel of  <dig> pi-responsive genes, including the full set of atpht <dig> genes, was used to assess the interactions of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> with other components of the p-starvation response . the gene panel also included a sub-set of those genes reported to respond to either local or systemic signals generated by plant p status  <cit> . the genes in the panel that respond to distant systemic p signals were atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig>  atpho <dig>  atmir399d, at <dig> and atips <dig>  while those that responded to local p status were aterf <dig>  atgstu <dig>  atlox <dig>  at2-mmp and atwrky <dig> 

in 44-day-old plants, the atpht1; <dig> mutation caused changes in the transcript levels of some of the selected pi-responsive genes . in the roots of pi-sufficient atpht1; <dig> plants, atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> were more strongly repressed than in wt, while atpht1; <dig> transcripts were more abundant . however, transcripts from all the atpht <dig> genes were induced to wt levels upon p depletion. atpri-mir399d transcripts were less strongly repressed in atpht1; <dig> roots at sufficient pi than in wt roots, while transcripts from the set of genes influenced by local pi signals were generally more strongly repressed consistent with higher pi concentrations in these roots. p-depletion of the atpht1; <dig> mutant resulted in lower atwrky <dig> transcript levels in the roots compared to wt. however, the abundance of these transcripts did not respond to changes in pi supply in the roots of the mutant. thus, atwrky <dig> transcript levels were also lower in this tissue than in the wt in the presence of pi.figure  <dig>

the shoots of atpht1; <dig> plants grown in the presence of sufficient pi contained less atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> transcripts than wt . in p-depleted plants, the abundance of atpht <dig> transcripts, including those from atpht1; <dig>  were generally de-repressed to the same levels seen in the wt. the exception was transcripts from atpht1; <dig>  which were not as strongly de-repressed as in wt. in atpht1; <dig> shoots, the only observed change in transcript profile for genes responsive to systemic signals of p status was a slight decrease in the strength of the de-repression of atpri-mir399d transcripts in the p-depleted plants. among the genes responsive to local p signals, atgstu <dig> was somewhat more repressed in pi-sufficient atpht1; <dig> shoots compared to wt, but this repression was overcome during p-depletion. by contrast, atlox <dig> transcripts were not as strongly de-repressed by p depletion in the mutant as in the wt.

the accumulation of transcripts from the target genes in 44-day-old atpht1;9– <dig> plants was similar to, but distinct from, that in the atpht1; <dig> mutant . in the roots of pi-sufficient atpht1;9– <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atlox <dig> transcripts were less abundant than in wt . during p depletion, atpht1; <dig> was less strongly de-repressed than in wt, while atpht1; <dig> transcripts were more abundant. atpri-mir399d and atat <dig> transcripts were less abundant in the p-deprived atpht1;9– <dig> mutant. interestingly, both at2-mmp and atwrky <dig> transcript amounts were lower in response to p depletion in the atpht1;9– <dig> mutant, similar to what was observed for atwrky <dig> in the roots of the atpht1; <dig> mutant.figure  <dig>

in the shoot of p-sufficient atpht1;9– <dig>  atpht1; <dig> was less repressed than in wt . transcripts from atpho <dig> were more strongly repressed by pi in the mutant than in wt which was complemented by a decreased repression by pi for both atpri-mir399d and atat <dig> transcripts. in the shoot of p-depleted atpht1;9– <dig>  atpht1; <dig> transcripts, along with those from the entire set of genes associated with local signaling events, were less de-repressed than those in the wt.

discussion
a clear response in arabidopsis to changes in p status is the reversible repression of atpht <dig> gene expression  <cit> . the modulation of atpht <dig> expression alters the pi transport activity within the plants in response to the prevailing pi availability  <cit> . here we provide evidence that atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> were instrumental in the movement of pi from the root to the shoot. in addition, we show that these genes had overlapping but distinct functions, as well as interactions at the transcript level with atpht1; <dig> and other genes that are involved in controlling p nutrition .figure  <dig> 
proposed location in the root and genetic interactions of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig>   proposed root-to-shoot translocation pathway for pi through the sequential action of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig>  the endodermis and/or pericycle are the most likely locations for atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig> appears to act in cell layers deeper in the root than atpht1; <dig>  perhaps in the pericycle or xylem. two potential translocation pathways are envisaged. the location of atpht1; <dig> and/or atpht1; <dig> in the xylem pole pericycle would facilitate the transfer of pi into the xylem for translocation to the shoot. .  summary of the observed genetic interactions of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> with other pi-responsive genes. the transcripts from the indicated genes were either more abundant  or less abundant  in the respective pht <dig> knock-out lines than in the wild type. the genetic interactions are superimposed onto the relative position proposed for atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> in the root. the diagram takes into consideration that the p concentration in each mutant is likely to be higher on the exterior side than on the interior side of the missing protein than in the wild-type. for example, since all the genes tested for interactions were repressed by pi supply, gene transcripts that were expressed at a lower level in a mutant were positioned toward the exterior of the root, where the p concentration was presumed to be higher in the mutant than in the wild type. such an assignment could not be made for pri-mir399d  in roots of pi-deprived seedlings, indicating our imperfect understanding of the regulation of pri-mir <dig> expression. the repression of atpho <dig> in leaves of pi-sufficient atpht1;9- <dig> may be in response to changes in the expression of the regulatory rnas mir399d and at <dig> .



atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> are necessary for the root-to-shoot translocation of pi
previous work indicated that both atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> are involved in pi uptake from the external medium, but that neither gene has a role in translocating pi to the shoot  <cit> . this conclusion was based on the observation that the shoots of mutant plants supplied with adequate pi had the same pi concentration as wild-type plants. by contrast, plants that were supplied with inadequate pi had genotype-dependent differences in shoot pi concentration. these differences in shoot pi accumulation were concluded to be a direct consequence of the pi concentration in the roots governing the pi concentration in the leaves. however, as discussed below, our short-term pi uptake experiments show that mutations in either atpht1; <dig> or atpht1; <dig> severely compromised the ability of arabidopsis to translocate pi to the shoot, explaining the lower total p concentrations that we also observe in the shoots of these mutants compared to wt.

as expected, our results showed that the rate of pi uptake from solution is markedly reduced in the atpht1;1– <dig> mutant compared to the wt. since atpht1; <dig> is one of the main paths for pi entry into the root during low pi availability  <cit> , it is not surprising that the lower uptake capacity in this mutant would compromise the amount of pi translocated to the shoot in the short term. the lower pi concentrations observed in the shoots in the short term are likely to be due to the roots of p-starved seedlings retaining a higher proportion of the available pi to satisfy root growth at the expense of pi translocation to support shoot growth. on the other hand, the lower shoot pi and po observed in the longer term in the shoots of this mutant are probably a direct consequence of the decreased p concentrations observed in the roots.

in contrast to atpht1;1– <dig>  both atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> mutants had the same pi-uptake rate as wt, which is also not surprising since pht1; <dig> would be fully functional in both mutants. however, the short-term accumulation of pi in the shoots of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> was much slower than in the atpht1;1– <dig> mutant, suggesting a role in root-to-shoot translocation. this interpretation is supported by the following. during longer-term growth under p sufficient conditions, roots of atpht1; <dig> had wt levels of both pi and po, while po was only slightly compromised in roots of atpht1;9– <dig>  therefore, the roots of atpht1; <dig> were just as capable of extracting pi and allocating it to po as those of wt and the roots of atpht1;9– <dig> nearly so. on the other hand, po, but not pi, concentrations were compromised in the shoots of the atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> plants, whereas the concentrations of both these p pools were compromised in the shoots of atpht1;1– <dig>  together, these observations demonstrate that atpht1; <dig> has little, if any, role in the uptake of pi, but instead is necessary for the root-to-shoot translocation of pi. the same is probably true for atpht1; <dig>  however atpht1;9- <dig> has a somewhat lower total p concentration in the root than wt, which is due to a compromised ability to allocate pi to root po. while this could be due to decreased pi uptake or the reduced export of po from the shoot, it is much more likely given our results to be due to atpht1; <dig> acting more prominently in an outer cell layer of the central cylinder of the root relative to atpht1; <dig> . this situation would result in a lower pi flux into the interior of the root for atpht1;9– <dig> than for atpht1; <dig> and a change in the balance of pi allocation that favours translocation to the shoot over the formation of po in the root. thus, atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> may operate analogous to the rice ospht1; <dig> transporter, which also functions mainly in the translocation of pi from the root to the shoot  <cit> . however, the two arabidopsis proteins act sequentially, with atpht1; <dig> acting in cell layers closer toward the root surface than atpht1; <dig> .

differences in the expression profiles of atpht <dig> genes that could lead to differences in function are apparent in a spatiotemporal gene expression map of the arabidopsis root  <cit> , where the resolution of the original microarray-based map has been substantially increased by additional microarray datasets . the plants used to generate the expression map were grown on solid medium containing  <dig>  mm pi. therefore, their tissues would have been saturated with pi, strongly suppressing pht <dig> gene expression. these seedlings, therefore, contrast with the pi-deprived seedlings with high pht <dig> expression that we used to discover that the movement of pi from the root to the shoot is controlled by atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> 

visualising the root gene expression map using the arabidopsis efp browser  <cit> , pht <dig> transcript abundance in seedlings grown under high pi conditions is especially low in the meristematic region of the root, from the columellar root cap nearly to the elongation zone . this is in contrast to the region extending from the top-most section of the meristematic region through the elongation zone into the maturation zone . the low meristematic expression of pht <dig> transcripts holds for all cell layers except the procambium. in the meristematic zone, atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> transcripts are generally as abundant, if not more abundant, than the transcripts recognised by the redundant microarray probe sets that detect the sum of atpht1;1 + atpht1; <dig> transcripts or the sum of atpht1;4 + atpht1; <dig> transcripts . this is particularly the case in the endodermal cell layer surrounding the stele  <cit>  . this transcript pattern suggests the endodermis of the meristematic region as a potential gateway where the control of pi transport could be mediated by atpht1; <dig> and/or atpht1; <dig> upon their de-repression at low pi availability .

the pht <dig> expression patterns within the cells of the stele suggest other potential sites where atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> may regulate pi transfer into the xylem . within the stele as a whole, transcripts from atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> do not predominate  <cit> . however, the higher-resolution gene expression data provided by brady et al.  <cit>  at the cellular level shows that this is largely due to a dilution effect caused by relatively high levels of transcripts from several other pht1genes in the procambium . atpht1; <dig> and/or atpht1; <dig> transcripts are more abundant relative to those from other atpht <dig> genes within the xylem of the meristematic region, at least in these pi-satiated plants. a similar high relative abundance of atpht1; <dig> and/or atpht1; <dig> transcripts also exists in the xylem pole pericycle cell strand. in this case, the high relative abundance of atpht1; <dig> and/or atpht1; <dig> transcripts extends from the root tip, through the meristematic and elongation zones into the maturation zone. this expression pattern, then, offers the potential for the xylem pole pericycle cell strand to regulate pi transport along a large section of the root . atpht1; <dig> and/or atpht1; <dig> transcripts are also relatively abundant compared to those from other pht <dig> genes in the protophloem + metaphloem and in the phloem companion cells within the meristematic region. if atpht1; <dig> and/or atpht1; <dig> are involved in controlling pi transport in these cells, it is likely in response to the flow of pi back to the root tip from the aerial tissues through the phloem, rather than to the flow from the root to the shoot through the xylem .

from the available results, it seems likely that the cells of the endodermis, the xylem pole pericycle, or the xylem itself, are where atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> could provide a barrier to pi transport. this barrier would separate the external solution from the vasculature with atpht1; <dig> acting in a cell layer closer to the root surface than atpht1; <dig> . confirmation of the cell types in which atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> regulate the flow of pi to the shoot awaits a high-resolution gene expression map of the root from seedlings in which pht <dig> gene expression is highly de-repressed by pi deprivation. however, a full picture of how atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> regulate the flow of pi to the shoot will require a full understanding of the biochemistry of these transporters, including any regulation of their activity by post-translational modification or by interactions with other proteins, including other pht <dig> proteins  <cit> .

absence of atpht1; <dig> modulates the activity of the pho <dig> regulon
our results support and extend the proposed interactions of both atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> with the pho <dig> regulatory circuit  <cit> . atpho <dig> encodes an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme implicated in repressing pi uptake when pi availability is high  <cit> . its expression is in turn repressed by the phloem-mobile microrna atmir <dig>  <cit> , a component of the systemic p-signaling system. atmir <dig> is synthesised in the shoot and translocated to the roots when shoot p status is low  <cit> . atmir <dig> functions by binding to and providing a substrate for the specific cleavage and degradation of pho <dig> transcripts. the activity of atmir <dig> is itself modulated by regulatory rnas atips <dig> and atat <dig>  which are thought to mimic the atpho <dig> transcript and compete for atmir <dig> binding  <cit> . together, atpho <dig> and these small rnas monitor the plant p status  <cit> . however, the interactions of the atpho <dig>  atmir <dig>  atips <dig> and atat <dig> gene products are complex, given that the expression of the atmir <dig> gene family as well as atips <dig> and atat <dig> are all de-repressed by low pi availability  <cit> . a decrease in atpho <dig> activity, either by mutating or suppressing atpho <dig>  or by ectopic over-expression of atmir <dig>  causes pi to accumulate in the shoots  <cit> . interestingly, both atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> are up-regulated in the atpho <dig> mutant and in atmir <dig> over-expression lines  <cit> . therefore, our results indicating that atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> are necessary for root-to-shoot pi translocation are consistent with these pi transport proteins being directly involved in the increased translocation of pi to the shoots in the transgenics with decreased atpho <dig> expression.

we found that the amounts of atpri-mir399d and atat <dig> transcripts in the shoots of atpht1;9– <dig> were not as strongly suppressed by pi as in the wt which may in turn explain the decrease in the amount of atpho <dig> transcript in these shoots . the abundance of transcripts from these three regulatory genes was consistent with the lower organic shoot p status of atpht1;9– <dig>  interestingly, the pi concentrations in the roots and shoots of these plants were the same as those in wt. therefore, the modulation of these components of the atpho <dig> regulatory circuit were either being influenced by highly localized pi concentrations, by an organic p ester, or by the absence of the atpht1; <dig> protein itself. the atpht1; <dig> mutation had little impact on the pho <dig> regulatory circuit other than a modest modulation in the amounts of the atmir399d primary transcript, further differentiating the activity of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> 

atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> activities govern the expression of atpht <dig> genes involved in inter-organ pi transport
transcript analysis in the atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> mutant backgrounds revealed numerous genetic interactions between these and the other atpht <dig> genes that are repressed by pi . these findings contradict an earlier report where atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> did not genetically interact with other pi-starvation induced genes in plants of low p status  <cit> . however, that earlier study used end-point pcr to quantify transcripts which is a less sensitive method of transcript quantification than real-time pcr. moreover, the transcript analysis was done on whole seedlings, while in our study roots and shoots were analysed separately and at two pi supply levels. together, these methodological differences in the earlier study may have masked the differences in transcript profiles that we report here.

the interactions of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> with other genes were overlapping , with 75% identity in the set of genes that showed significant changes in gene expression in both mutant lines compared to wt. the differences in effect of these two genes on other genes is a further indication that atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> are functionally distinct, consistent with the view that they act sequentially in pi translocation. the interactions were apparently independent of organ pi levels, since the long-term pi concentrations in the atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> mutants were nearly indistinguishable from those in the wt. the interactions did, however, correlate with lower organ po concentrations, indicating that the plants were not as highly p satiated as wt plants. thus, a signal other than organ-level pi concentration was likely to be responsible for the observed co-expression patterns.

the interactions of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> with other atpht <dig> genes excluded atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig>  which encode transporters that are important for pi uptake from the soil solution  <cit> . most of the interactions were instead with atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig>  suggesting that the encoded transporters, like atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> themselves, are likely important for inter-organ pi transport processes. this role has already been demonstrated for atpht1; <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> were also among a very small group of phr1-regulated genes that displayed a very strong and specific response to pi availability in the root environment, with only atpht1; <dig> also responding equally well in shoots, as shown previously  <cit> . there was no evidence for a genetic interaction between atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> themselves in our study. this is interesting, given that the two transporters appear to act sequentially in the transport of pi to the shoot.

the lack of a strong alteration in transcript abundance for other atpht <dig> genes in the roots of the atpht1; <dig> mutant under pi deficiency was a further indication that the disruption of atpht1; <dig> function was directly responsible for the lower capacity for pi translocation to the shoot in this mutant. by contrast, the alterations in atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> transcript abundance in the roots of atpht1;9– <dig> under pi deficiency leaves open the possibility that the genetic interaction of atpht1; <dig> with these genes is necessary for pi translocation in wt. the stronger repression compared to that in wt of atpht1; <dig>  atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> in atpht1; <dig> roots and of atpht1; <dig> in atpht1;9– <dig> roots under adequate pi supply indicated that decreases in the amounts of these other atpht <dig> proteins may also have contributed to the lower p accumulation in mutant shoots. a better understanding of the precise location of the various pht <dig> proteins within the plant is necessary to more thoroughly interpret these findings.

the genes involved in local pi signaling were even more strongly repressed by high pi in the atpht1; <dig> mutant than in the wt . the stronger repression in roots compared with that in shoots hinted at a possible accumulation of pi or down-stream metabolites in roots due to reduced pi transport into the shoot. the observed repression of atwrky <dig> in low-pi roots and atlox <dig> in shoots of the same treatment could indicate that the underlying “local” p regulatory circuits trigger different downstream responses in different organs. for example, atlox <dig> repression may lead to reduced shoot growth in low-pi conditions, given that the atlox <dig> gene is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid, an effector of shoot growth  <cit> .

integration of pht <dig> gene expression and tissue pi status
the transcriptional responsiveness of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> to changes in pi supply was similar to each other, but not identical. feeding pi to pi-deprived plants suppressed atpht1; <dig> transcripts in the roots more quickly and more strongly than atpht1; <dig> transcripts. by contrast, the suppression of atpht1; <dig> transcripts in the shoots of these same plants was stronger than that for atpht1; <dig>  although the overall response of p-responsive transcripts in the shoots was much weaker than that in the roots.

for both atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig>  and indeed nearly all of the atpht <dig> genes, the strong repression in the roots upon pi re-supply brought the transcript levels far below those found in control plants continually fed pi. this would be a useful adaptation for plants in their natural environment, where the available pi concentration in the soil rarely exceeds 10 μm  <cit> . plants growing under these soil conditions would most certainly not be pi-limited, but there would be strong pht <dig> expression and a danger of pi over-accumulation if a rich supply of pi was encountered. thus, should a pi-limited plant encounter a very pi-rich soil patch, the rapid and strong systemic suppression of atpht1; <dig> in the roots followed by the suppression of atpht1; <dig> and the other atpht <dig> genes would prevent pi toxicity through the rapid decrease in the influx of pi into the shoots. the observed stronger suppression of all atpht <dig> transcripts in the roots upon pi re-supply could be due to a systemic signal, given that the nutrient solution is quickly depleted of pi and pi accumulation is much stronger in the shoot than in the root itself . by contrast, the weaker over-all suppression of atpht <dig> transcript abundance in the shoots could be a response to the lower pi accumulation in the root, more slowly increasing po concentrations or to the lower local accumulation of pi in the cytosol of shoot cells, given that most of the pi translocated to the shoot would immediately be moved to the vacuole  <cit> . the observed increase in pht <dig> transcript abundance in the shoot after  <dig> d of pi re-supply was consistent with this proposed delay in pi signal perception in the shoot.

loss of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> did not intensify the morpho-physiological response to pi limitation
plants respond to changes in pi supply by altering their physiology and biochemistry, both of which are modulated by changes in gene expression  <cit> . key physiological characteristics associated with low pi availability are a relative increase in resource allocation to the roots resulting in an increased root-to-shoot ratio as well as increased root-hair proliferation, root branching and lateral root elongation  <cit> . the deployment of these traits is often accompanied by an arrest in primary root elongation. in our system, inactivation of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> had little effect on the establishment of these traits.

our conclusions regarding the morpho-physiological responses of the atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> mutants to changes in pi status was somewhat contrary to a previous report on these two genes  <cit> . in the earlier report, atpht1; <dig> mutants, including the atpht1;9– <dig> knock-out allele examined here, and atpht1; <dig> / atpht1; <dig> rnai co-suppressed lines, showed increased p-starvation responses compared to those in wt. these enhanced responses included effects on primary root length, lateral root length and shoot fw  <cit> . the disparity between our studies could be due to differences in the plant growth conditions. for example, remy et al.  <cit>  used a medium containing 100 μm fe, while our medium contained 40 μm fe. high fe concentrations can lead to the precipitation of pi thus aggravating p limitation responses. previous work showed that the inhibition of primary root growth during pi limitation of arabidopsis grown on synthetic media was due to fe toxicity and that the recovery from inhibition was more rapid for larger plants  <cit> . thus, our larger plants seem to have been quite immune to the fe exposure in the medium used here. other differences in growth conditions that may have led to study-dependent differences in plant root architecture under pi limitation were the gelling agent  <cit>  and the presence or absence of myo-inositol, a precursor for many secondary messenger molecules and a regulator of plant growth responses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the products of the atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> genes are involved in the translocation of pi from the roots to the shoot in arabidopsis. when supplied with moderate pi for an extended period, the reduced pi translocation to the shoots in atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> did not affect shoot pi concentration, but instead lowered the organic p concentration. some of the observed effects on growth and p allocation in the atpht1; <dig> and atpht1;9– <dig> mutants may be indirect, as mutations in these genes caused changes to the transcript abundance of other atpht <dig> genes. the loss of atpht1; <dig> also had an indirect effect on the transcript abundance of genes involved in systemic signalling mediated by the pho2/mir <dig> network. thus, atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> have a wider role in the control of p nutrition in arabidopsis than was previously reported.
