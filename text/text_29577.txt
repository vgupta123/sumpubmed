BACKGROUND
most of biochemical reactions inherent to the life of a cell are mediated by protein-protein interactions, e. g. the recognition of a substrate by an enzyme, or an antigen by an antibody. protein-protein interaction is influenced by several factors like the size and shape of the interface, shape complementarity between interacting proteins or hydrophobicity  <cit> . interfaces between interacting proteins have been extensively studied for decades now  <cit> . it has been shown that they have distinct features when compared to non-specific interfaces observed in protein crystals  <cit> , or when compared to the rest of the protein surface  <cit> . different models have been proposed for the protein binding process. the first was the 'lock and key' model, stating that interacting proteins bind to each other thanks to shape complementarity, without structural modification. another model has then been suggested: the induced fit, in which the protein structure is modified upon binding  <cit> . finally, it is thought that unbound protein exist as an ensemble of conformations, some of them being more favorable for the interaction  <cit> , this is the pre-existing equilibrium model. as the number of experimental 3d protein structures increases, some evidences of induced-fit and pre-existing equilibrium are now available and are described in  <cit> .

the prediction of protein-protein interactions is a current challenge. some bioinformatic methods have been developed in order to predict whether or not two proteins interact  <cit> . when it is known that two proteins interact, docking methods are employed to predict the 3d structure of the resulting complex, given the structures of interacting partners  <cit> . the performance of docking methods are monitored by critical assessment of predicted interactions , a blind prediction experiment where structural biologists provide unpublished experimental complex structures as targets for docking programs  <cit> . induced fit introduces a supplementary difficulty to the challenging task of docking. slight modifications involve the rearrangement of side chains that change their conformations to accommodate the interaction with the interacting protein. stronger modifications can also alter the backbone conformation. flexible protein-protein docking methods are thus developed in order to account for these conformational changes .

the extend of induced fit modification in protein-protein complexes has been previously studied. a study made by betts and sternberg in  <dig> revealed that, in a dataset of  <dig> protein-protein complexes, a half exhibited substantial movements, when compared to pairs of similar proteins solved by different groups  <cit> . it has been later shown that the structural changes upon protein-protein binding correlate well with the theoretical displacements derived from normal mode analysis  <cit> . recently, this was further explored on antibodies that bind different antigens  <cit> . the case of enzymes has also been addressed: the conformational modification induced by the binding appears to be small in most enzymes , but residues belonging to the binding site exhibit larger backbone motions  <cit> . recently, daily and gray have used control sets to distinguish between enzyme induced fit modifications and experimental error or intrinsic flexibility of proteins  <cit> . they found that about 20% of the residues exhibit substantial conformational changes and noted a significant bias toward weakly constrained regions, e. g., loops.

in this study, we propose an investigation of structural changes in protein complexes, from a local point-of-view, via a structural alphabet developed in our lab. we consider a set of protein-protein complexes for which the crystallographic structures of both the complex and free partners are available, and quantify the structural changes in terms of structural letter modifications. we also use a control set of  <dig> protein pairs for which the structures has been independently determined by a different team, as in  <cit> . the correlation between global change and the number of local change is investigated. we then study the preference for particular letters in the interface regions, and analyze the structural letter substitutions that occur at the interfaces. we also use this new approach to detect common binding motifs in unrelated proteins.

RESULTS
proteins from  <dig> complexes are represented as sequences of structural letters using our structural alphabet called hmm-sa  <cit> . we then analyze the differences between bound and unbound structural letter sequences. for clarity, we briefly present here the structural alphabet hmm-sa; more details can be found in  <cit> .

hmm-sa, is a library of  <dig> structural prototypes of four residues, called structural letters, established using hidden markov model formalism. thanks to hmm-sa, the 3d structure of a protein backbone is simplified into a sequence of structural prototypes. the simplification relies on cα positions only: each four-residue fragment of the protein structure is described by four inter-cα distances. the resulting distances are the input of a hidden markov model, and the structure is translated as a sequence of structural letters. this encoding is made using the viterbi algorithm  <cit>  and takes into account both the similarity of the fragments with the  <dig> structural letters and the preferred transitions between structural letters. a protein structure of n residues is then encoded as a sequence of n -  <dig> structural letters. the model has been trained on  <dig> x-ray structures of globular proteins, presenting less than 30% sequence identity with a resolution better than  <dig>  Å and longer than  <dig> residues. these structures were taken from the pdb, irrespective of their quaternary structures. they represent a total of  <dig>  four-residue fragments.

the  <dig> structural letters, named , are shown on figure 1a. it has been shown previously  <cit> , that four structural letters,  specifically describe α-helices, and five structural letters, , specifically describe β-strands. letters  and  are the most regular,  being slightly shorter. it has been shown that linear helices are encoded by runs of , and curved helices are encoded by runs of   <cit> . the  <dig> remaining structural letters describe loops. letters  form helix ends and letters  form strand ends. this alphabet allows a very precise decomposition of 3d structures. some structural letters are structurally close, while others are more distant. this is quantified using the root-mean-square deviation between two structural letters . the rmsddev has been computed from  <dig> fragment pairs randomly chosen in the two structural letters  <cit> . it has been shown, that the rmsddev between two structural letters is always greater than the intrinsic variability of each structural letters, measured in the same way and called rmsdintra  <cit> . figure 1b reports the hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> structural letters according to the rmsddev. using a cut-off of  <dig> Å, the  <dig> structural letters are grouped into  <dig> groups: , , , , , , , and .

number of local changes
a set  <dig> protein pairs solved by different groups is used as a control set to assess the local structural changes observed in a data set of  <dig> protein-protein complexes, denoted as the complex set. in the control set,  <dig>  structural letters are modified out of  <dig> . the total number of structural letter pairs considered in the complex set is  <dig> . overall,  <dig>  structural letters are unchanged , and  <dig>  are changed . this proportion is significantly greater than the proportion in the control set, as assessed by a chi-square test .

if we consider the  <dig> groups of structural letters with a  <dig> Å rmsddev threshold  by ignoring structural letter changes within the same group, we obtain the following results: 5% of the control set is modified  and 11% of the complex set is modified . these proportions are significantly different as assessed by a chi-square test .

the global compositions of bound and unbound chains, in terms of structural letters, are similar , except for helical letters  and : bound conformations have more  and less  than unbound conformations.

number of changes in different classes
there are  <dig> classes of complexes in the complex set: enzyme-substrate, antibody-antigen, and others. table  <dig> summarizes the number of changes in the different types of complexes.

a: cα root mean square deviation between bound and unbound conformations, b: number of protein chains involved, c: total number of structural letters involved, d: percentage of structural letters that differ between bound and unbound conformation.

antibody-antigen complexes undergo 29% of structural letter modifications, a number similar to that obtained on the control set. thus, on the limited number of structures available , this class of proteins shows only moderate modifications upon protein-protein binding. the 'other' class experiences the highest percentage of structural letter changes . this class encompasses different kind of complexes . the enzyme class has an intermediate behavior with 32% of modifications. in their study, daily et al found that 20% of the residues in enzymes are significantly modified upon binding  <cit> . here, we find 32% of change in the structural letter sequences. as we show later, a part of these changes replace a structural letter by a similar one. table  <dig> also reports the percentages of modified structural letters according to the root mean square deviation of the cα . for all types of complexes, the global tendency is a correlation between the percentage of modified structural letters and the cα rmsd, the exception being the antibody-antigen in which a low percentage of modified letter  is obtained for high rmsd  for  <dig> chains.

local change versus global change
some structures undergo minor global modifications, and other structures are significantly modified, as assessed by the cα rmsd ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å. for comparison, the cα rmsd on the control set ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å, with a mean value equal to  <dig>  Å . the percentage of modified structural letters for different rmsd ranges is indicated in table  <dig>  as expected, the percentage of modified structural letters is higher on the structures with high rmsd.

to analyze in more details the relation between local and global modifications, we confront the cα rmsd with the percentage of structural letter modification in the complex set. figure 2a illustrates the correlation between the number of structural letters that differ between bound and unbound conformations, and the cα rmsd between bound and unbound conformations, in the complex set. the first is a measure of local structural change, while the second is a measure of global change. it can be seen from figure  <dig>  that both measures are positively correlated: structures with great rmsd tend to have a high percentage of structural letters that differ between bound and unbound conformations. this confirms the results shown in table  <dig>  the pearson correlation coefficient between both measures is  <dig>  . however, protein structures with a cα rmsd lower than  <dig> Å exhibit a great range of structural letter change proportion, from  <dig> to more than 70%. it indicates that the structural letter sequences bring an information about the structural changes that can not be evaluated by the cα rmsd alone.

two chains exhibit high cα rmsd, around  <dig> Å, but a moderate fraction of structural letter changes, around 30%. these two chains are chain a of receptor part in complex 2vis  and chain b of receptor part of the same complex . the examination of these structures shows that they are made of two domains that undergo large motions upon binding, as can be seen on figure 2b. the relative orientation of the two domains is significantly modified, hence leading to a high cα rmsd. the local structures, however, remains similar, as assessed by the moderate percentage of modified structural letters. if they are superimposed by portion, the two domains have low cα rmsd:  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å for domains 1– <dig> and 110– <dig> for chain a.

on the contrary, some structures exhibit slight global modifications but a high proportion of local changes: chains a and b of the receptor part of complex 1i4d , and chain b of the receptor part of complex 1f <dig> . these structures, shown on figure 2c, have a good conservation of there global structures, but the structural letter sequences capture some subtle differences in helix structures. the unbound helices are encoded by runs of helical letter , alternate with less regular letters  and , whereas bound helices are encoded by homogeneous runs of , suggesting a higher regularity of bound helices.

it thus appears that the structural alphabet approach offers a complementary approach to the global rmsd as a few local change can be associated to drastic global change, and inversely.

comparison with local rmsd
the structural alphabet provides a simplified but detailed description of the protein backbone. as shown on figure  <dig> some structural letters have very similar conformation, e.g.,  and , whereas others are clearly different, e.g.,  and . this disparity has been quantified in  <cit> , by the rmsddev:  <dig>  Å between  and , and  <dig>  Å between  and . furthermore, the structural letters have different intrinsic variability, as measured by the rmsdintra. the rmsdintra of the structural alphabet varies from  <dig>  Å for letter , to  <dig>  Å for letter   <cit> . the consequences are that  different structural encoding can be observed for similar conformations , and  the same structural letter can encode relatively dissimilar fragments, e. g., the most variable letter . it is then desirable to check for consistency between the structural alphabet approach and classical external measures to assess the extend of the local deformations. the aim is to see if the structural alphabet, used for structure description, can also be used to detect significant local deformations.

structural deformations between bound and unbound forms is usually assessed using classical rmsd computation. in that section, we show a comparison between the assessment of deformation using the structural alphabet and classical rmsd. the measure of deformation using the structural alphabet is given by the rmsddev associated to the structural letter change between bound and unbound forms. for the measure using classical rmsd, we computed local cα rmsd in a sliding window of four residues along the protein. the reason why we choose a size of four residues for the sliding window is because the structural letters are four-residue long. the results of this comparison on the complex set is shown in figure  <dig>  in case of identical structural letter in the bound and unbound structure , we consider the rmsdintra, instead of rmsddev, which is a measure of the intrinsic variability of each structural letter. a few cases of identical structural letters correspond to high local rmsd. these cases correspond to fragments that are surrounded by structural letter substitutions. for example, fragment 64– <dig> of the r chain of the ligand part of complex 1wq <dig> is encoded by qfo in the unbound form and ffe in the bound form. the fragment encoded by the central f has a local rmsd equal to  <dig> Å. the case of different structural letter between bound and unbound forms is called a structural letter substitution . here, we further introduce a distinction between isolated substitutions  and substitutions that appear in stretch . an isolated substitution denotes a structural letter that is modified when one or both of its neighbors remain unchanged, e.g, art → abt or art → abg. inversely, a stretched substitution denotes a structural letter change surrounded by modified structural letters, e. g., art → cbg. 61% of the structural letter substitutions appear isolated, and 39% appear in stretch. an unexpected finding of this analysis is that some structural letter substitutions exhibit a high rmsddev but a low local rmsd . for example, we observe  <dig> cases of structural letter substitutions with an associated rmsddev greater than  <dig> Å and a local rmsd lower than  <dig>  Å, out of  <dig>  substitutions associated to rmsddev greater than  <dig> Å . among  <dig> isolated substitutions associated with rmsd dev greater than  <dig> Å,  <dig> correspond to local rmsd lower than  <dig>  Å i. e., 70%. if we consider only stretched substitutions, this ratio is only 15% . this effect is thus more frequently seen in isolated substitutions than in stretched substitutions. this can be globally assessed by the pearson correlation coefficient between local rmsd and rmsddev:  <dig>  for isolated substitutions and  <dig>  for stretched substitutions. these cases correspond to fragments with low rmsd but encoded by highly dissimilar structural letters. they are due to the stochastic nature of the structural encoding using a hmm.

a consequence is that the rmsddev alone cannot be used to quantify the structural change. this analysis tells us that although the structural alphabet offers a unique original tool to detect and qualitatively describe structural deformation, this information has to be combined with the local rmsd in order to properly measure the deformation.

analysis of interface regions
the interface regions are defined using voronoi tessellations. among the  <dig>  residues in the complex set,  <dig>  are thus defined as interface residues. interface residues then represent 12% of the whole dataset .

interface local structure
the local structure composition of the interface set is compared to the global composition of the complex set on figure 4a. the relative frequency of helical letters  and extended letters  is lower in the interface set than in the complex set. it is in agreement with the study of ansari et al  <cit>  who showed that coils are more abundant in protein-protein interfaces than in general. letters that form helix ends  are more abundant in the interface set. the majority of coil letters are favored at the interface set  but some particular letters are not:  . the statistical significance of structural letter preference for interface regions is assessed by z-scores computation, illustrated on figure 4b. these z-scores compare the structural letter proportion in the interface with the proportion in non-interface regions. the significance threshold, corrected by bonferroni, is equal to  <dig> . figure 4b indicates that letters  are significantly under-represented in the interface, while letters  are significantly over-represented. the structural alphabet thus provides more information than the classical helix/strand/coil classification: some structural letters found in the coil are not favored at the interface.

number of local changes
a total of  <dig>  structural letters are involved in the interface:  <dig>   are unchanged and  <dig>   are changed. if we consider the  <dig> groups of figure  <dig>   <dig> structural letters are changed . this is significantly greater than the results obtained for the whole structures , as assessed by chi-square tests .

to assess if each individual letter undergo more substitutions in the interface set than in the control set, we compute z-scores . all the structural letters, except , are more modified in the interface set than in the control set. the difference is significant for  <dig> letters out of  <dig>  particularly high for letters i, q, j, and k.

number of possible substitutions
the number of possible substitutions  for each type of structural letters are reported in table  <dig>  nsub quantifies, for each structural letter, the mean number of structural letters it can be substituted with. in the control set, helical letters  experience the highest nsub, around 3– <dig>  it means that these letters are replaced, on average, by three to five different letters. extended letter  have nsub around  <dig>  among the structural letters that describe coils, only letters  have a nsub greater or equal to  <dig>  it indicates that the expected variations in structural sequences caused by experimental error and natural protein flexibility affect preferentially helices, strands in a lesser extend, and a few coil letters. it is known that loop regions are more flexible that regular secondary structures. the variations observed in helix and strand structural sequences may be due to the fact that our structural alphabet offers a very detailed description of these regions.

the same global tendency is observed in the control and the interface sets: high nsub for helical letters, some of the extended letters and a few coil letters. however, the nsub computed from the the complex set are higher than the nsub computed from the control set. the interface region analysis results, in a majority of cases, in higher nsub than in the complex set, confirming that interface regions undergo more various structural changes. the nsub are one to two points greater in the interface set than in the control set, except for letters  ,   and  , resulting in nsub greater than  <dig> for these letters. on the contrary, letter  has the lowest nsub, equal to  <dig>  this analysis thus reveals that some structural letters are particularly affected by the binding .

severity of local deformations
the quantitative measurement of structural letter changes is assessed using the local rmsd. in the control set, 5% of the fragments show a local rmsd greater than  <dig>  Å. we will then use  <dig>  Å as a threshold to select significant local deformations. in the complex set, 25% of the fragments have local rmsd greater than  <dig>  Å, and 35% if we restrict to the interface fragments. it thus appears that interface regions undergo more severe local changes than the rest of the structure.

it thus appears that the severity of local deformation is not uniform among the structural letters, in particular among structural letters describing coils. some structural letters are more likely to be affected by the formation of protein-protein complex.

structural letter substitutions
now that we have shown that some structural letters are preferentially affected upon binding, the next step is to analyze the resulting conformation after binding, namely the structural letter substitutions. figure  <dig> is an illustration of the probabilities of structural letter substitution in the interface region. the unbound form is taken as the reference for this computation. to take into account only significant changes, we restrict the analysis to the pairs of structural letters that correspond to a local rmsd greater than  <dig>  Å. the number of structural letter pairs with local rmsd greater than  <dig>  Å is  <dig>  including  <dig> cases of structural letter identity. among the  <dig> possible substitution probabilities ,  <dig> are non-null and  <dig> are greater than 5%. it must be noted that the substitution probability matrix is highly asymmetrical.

for example, extended letters  display high probabilities to be substituted into letter  upon binding. the probability for letter  to be transformed into  in the interface region upon binding is  <dig> %, whereas it is  <dig> % for the inverse transformation from  to . this arises from the normalization with respect to the unbound form needed for the probability computation. the substitution count table is nearly symmetrical, as shown in additional file  <dig>  but the number of structural letters in each class being unequal , it results in asymmetry in the substitution probabilities. to facilitate the global examination of figure  <dig>  let us separate the  <dig> structural letters into the  <dig> main groups associated to classical secondary structure elements:  for helix and helix borders,  for strands and strand borders, and the remaining  for coils.

many substitutions occur within the helical group , and, in a lesser extend, in the extended group . these substitutions are responsible for subtle modifications of regular secondary structures, like illustrated in figure  <dig>  inside the coil group, that gathers a variety of distinct conformations, significant substitutions occur from letters  and toward letters . eight substitutions with probability greater than 5% are observed from the helix group to the coil group, including  <dig> substitutions with probabilities greater than 10%: from  to  , from  to   and from  to  . in the same way,  <dig> substitutions with probability greater than 5% occur from the strand group to the coil group, one of them with probability greater than 10%: from  to  . four substitutions with probabilities greater than 5% occur from the coil to the helix group  and  <dig> occur from coil to strand group, including three substitutions with high probability:  to  ,  to   and  to  . no substitutions occur between strand and helix groups with high probabilities. this analysis tells us that the local structural modifications that occur upon binding are most of the time subtle substitutions between structural letters belonging to the same major groups. conformational changes occur mainly following a continuum between helices/coils and strands/coils and a few structural letters play key role in the modifications.

the structural alphabet thus provides a new way to describe local structural changes as the substitution of a structural letter by another one. it is the first time, to our knowledge, that such a qualitative description is reported.

graphical examples
structural modifications occur in both partners: region 186– <dig> in chymotrypsin and region 38– <dig> in eglin part. the global cα rmsd for chymotrypsin  is  <dig>  Å and the percentage of structural letter substitution is 37%. for eglin , global cα rmsd is  <dig>  Å and 45% of the structural letters are modified. both modifications involve letters  which are significantly more modified in the interface set than in the control set. 1de <dig>  shown in figure 7d, is a complex between beta2-microglobulin and a transferrin receptor. the structural modification highlighted here occur in region 13– <dig> of the beta2-microglobulin and region 519– <dig> of the transferrin receptor . the local structures of both partners are modified were the contact occurs. beta2-microglobulin  has a global cα rmsd equal to  <dig>  Å and 49% of structural letter substitution. the transferrin receptor  has a global cα rmsd equal to  <dig>  Å and 41% of its structural letters are modified upon binding. both regions involve letters .

a last illustration of the conformational change analysis using the structural alphabet is shown in figure  <dig>  in this analysis, we use the structural alphabet to detect common binding motifs in unrelated proteins. the question raised is: " do proteins with unrelated functions exhibit similar structural motifs at the interface ?" the objective is to identity, if any, such structural motifs that could be considered as case of "local structural convergence" toward the same conformation, from unrelated proteins. we applied the following criteria to detect such cases:

• we look for structural motifs at least four structural letter long ;

• the motif should be present in the bound forms of at least two complexes from different classes. we consider the  <dig> classes from table  <dig>  namely enzyme/substrate, antibody/antigen, and other;

• the motif should be located in totality at the protein-protein interfaces of the complexes;

• we do not consider runs of helical letters  or extended letters . helices and strands being highly abundant in 3d structures, these motifs may be non significant;

• a significant local deformation should be seen, at the considered motif, in at least one complex;

• the local rmsd between the bound fragments covered by the motif should be lower than the local rmsd between unbound fragments.

using these criteria, we extracted common bound motifs from proteins with unrelated function. with the rmsd criterion, we select cases where the conformational change induced by the binding put the bound structures closer than the unbound structures, what we call "local structural convergence". given the limited amount of data we have, and the stringent criteria we applied , we found only a few cases of local structural convergence. two examples are illustrated in figure  <dig>  structural motif goif is seen in two unrelated complexes: 1ahw, an antibody/antigen complex, and 1bvn, an enzyme/substrate complex. the local cα rmsd for the corresponding fragment is  <dig>  Å between unbound forms and  <dig>  Å only between bound forms. complex 1ahw undergoes only minor conformational change, as assessed by the rmsd equal to  <dig>  Å, and a similar unbound structural motif: goij. complex 1bvn is modified up to an amount of  <dig>  Å, starting from a different structural motif: sgrf. the underlying amino-acid sequences are 'lqhgesp'  and 'vidlgge' . structural motif llgi is seen in one 'other' complex, 1grn  and one enzyme/substrate complex, 1udi. both complexes are significantly modified by the binding:  <dig>  Å rmsd for 1grn, from kpql to llgi, and 1udi, in a lesser extend:  <dig>  Å rmsd, from lnng to llgi. local rmsd are equal to  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å before and after binding respectively. underlying amino-acid sequences are 'yvptvfd'  and 'qlviqes' . these examples highlight the usefulness of the structural alphabet for further analysis studies using larger data sets.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals that the structural alphabet offers a new way to investigate local deformations induced by the protein-protein interaction. classical studies revealed that interface regions preferentially involve loops. here, we show that two structural letters forming helix ends  are preferred at the interface and that only a part of the structural letters describing the loops, , are preferred at the interface. letters  are particularly affected by the binding . concerning the severity of the substitutions, letters  are subject to major modifications.

it is the first time that local conformation changes can be qualitatively described in such a way. the main advantage of using the structural alphabet approach, compared to classical rmsd measure, is that it provides a description of bound and unbound conformations, and, in turn, a qualitative description of the deformation. this feature opens the perspective for further studies, such as the classification of interface structural motifs and structural changes. the following questions could be addressed: are the structural modifications common to any type of complexes ? can the same structural modifications be observed in unrelated proteins ? could we use the qualitative description of structural changes to make a classification of binding movements ? an example of such analysis is illustrated in figure  <dig>  in which we highlight two examples of common binding structural motifs from unrelated proteins. although the actual amount of data is insufficient to derive any conclusive remarks, the structural alphabet approach seems very promising to address such questions.

the computation of structural letter substitution probabilities highlights some preferred substitutions. such informations could be useful for flexible docking experiments and binding pocket detection at protein surfaces. flexible docking strategies include the use of ensembles of alternate starting conformations -taken from molecular dynamic simulation  <cit>  or other conformational sampling techniques  <cit> - and the explicit integration of conformational changes during the docking procedure via simulated annealing refinement  <cit>  or multicopy mean-field approach  <cit> . in this framework, the structural letter substitution probabilities derived from the present study could be used in a conformational sampling technique. the structural letter substitution matrix could be used in a generative manner using a markov process: starting from the unbound structural letter sequence, modifications are introduced using the matrix, to generate a potential bound structural letter sequence. it is then possible to re-build the bound backbone from the structural letter sequence  <cit> . this would probably require some external methods to predict which region is to be modified. the strong transition rules between successive structural letters  <cit>  should also be taken into account in order to generate realistic structural letter sequences.
