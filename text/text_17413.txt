BACKGROUND
in drosophila, there is an excess of retrogenes moving from the x chromosome to autosomal regions
 <cit> . interestingly, those retrogenes are frequently expressed in testis
 <cit> . both observations have been reported several times in drosophila melanogaster
 <cit> , as well as in other species of mammals
 <cit>  and mosquitoes
 <cit> . in addition, a comparative study between the genomes of twelve drosophila species revealed excessive movement out of the x chromosome for both retrogenes and dna-based duplications in the drosophila genus
 <cit> . further, older genes that originated before the split of the drosophila and sophophora subgenera and for which expression is greater in males than females, are under-represented on the x chromosome
 <cit> . the gene movement off the x chromosome likely contributed, along with other mechanisms, to the paucity of x-linked male-biased genes found in drosophila <cit> .

several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the excessive movement of genes out of the x chromosome and the paucity of male-biased x-linked genes
 <cit> . these hypotheses include  meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ,  dosage compensation,  meiotic drive, and  sexual antagonism, and they all assume that natural selection has favoured accumulation of male-biased genes on the autosomes
 <cit> . two of those hypotheses, msci and dosage compensation, have been tested and shown to play a role in the genomic relocation of retrogenes expressed in testis
 <cit> . msci is predicated on the hypothesis that retrogenes located on autosomes continue functioning during male meiosis whereas otherwise they would be subjected to inactivation
 <cit> . indeed, in meiosis where msci occurs, autosomal retrogenes have higher expression than their parental x-linked genes, presumably to compensate for their inactivation
 <cit> . in drosophila, the dosage compensation hypothesis also predicts a decrease in the number of male-biased genes in the x chromosome relative to autosomes
 <cit> . up-regulation in males is less effective for x-linked genes since they are already hypertranscribed during dosage compensation
 <cit> . consistent with this hypothesis, autosomal retrogenes are often derived from x-linked parental genes that reside close to components of the dosage compensation machinery
 <cit> .

the recent study by metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  proposed a new interpretation which negated the need for selection-based hypotheses to understand the out-of-the x movement pattern of drosophila retrogenes. to test the general role of natural selection, metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  identified retrogenes for which the parental gene has been lost or degenerated. in other words, the parental genes and retrogenes are never found in the same species. this innovative approach differed from previous studies that analyzed both parental and retrogene copies of the same species
 <cit> . a key argument used for their analysis was that the remaining retrogenes assumed and maintained parental ancestral function
 <cit> . this unique set of parental genes and retrogenes  displayed no differences in their patterns of dna sequence evolution nor in sex-biased expression. however, these retrogenes still showed excessive movement out of the x chromosome suggesting no selection for these genes based on differential gene expression in males. moreover, the genes studied by metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  displayed female-biased or unbiased  expression profiles. therefore, the authors suggest that such gene movement in drosophila is not related to male-biased expression and therefore is a general non-adaptive property of retrotransposition
 <cit> .

we revisited the analyses and sex-biased expression data presented by metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  and found several issues with the retrogene dataset and expression data used that tended to render their arguments arguable. first, we found that the set of retrogenes was a segmental dataset in which the majority of genes with male-biased expression were excluded. second, we observed that the general unbiased expression they claimed to exist was actually a consequence of the use of expression data from whole animals. sex-biased gene expression  is poorly revealed when rna is obtained from whole-body samples in comparison to dissected tissues 
 <cit> . third, we found that most of the observed female-biased expression is derived from x-linked parental genes. the dataset provided by metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  shows an excess of x→a movement and therefore contains a significant number of parental genes that are located on the x chromosome, which is known to be enriched with female-biased genes. fourth, we analyzed additional gonad expression data that support the evidence that autosomal genes show higher male-related expression than x-linked genes. in the following four sections, we report our analyses of metta and schlötterer’s
 <cit>  data that led to conclusions different from their previous ones.

RESULTS
the segmental dataset underestimated male-biased expression
we analyzed the dataset of positionally relocated genes for  <dig> drosophila species
 <cit> , used by metta and schlötterer
 <cit> . bhutkar et al. <cit>  identified  <dig> cases of inter-chromosomal retrotransposition for which the parental copy had degenerated or had been lost . metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  further filtered the dataset by several criteria such as high coverage between orthologous sequence alignments and intron absence to control the data quality 
 <cit> . therefore, for those remaining  <dig> cases together with a previously identified retrogene , , each of the  <dig> drosophila species has only one orthologous gene that corresponds either to the parental gene or the retrogene. in metta and schlötterer’s study
 <cit> , d. melanogaster expression was retrieved from flyatlas
 <cit>  .

metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  found that none of the  <dig> cases of inter-chromosomal retroposition showed testis-biased expression in d. melanogaster. however, the pattern of testis-biased expression changes significantly between the segmental dataset  and the initial dataset of  <dig> retrogenes from bhutkar et al. <cit> . nine out of the  <dig> remaining cases  show testis-biased expression in d. melanogaster <cit> , which is significantly different from the expression patterns found in their segmental dataset . 
 <cit> . segmental dataset corresponds to the  <dig> movement cases selected by metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  from the original  <dig> cases in
 <cit> . excluded dataset corresponds to the remaining  <dig> cases. the number of testis-biased genes is significantly higher in the excluded dataset , which implies that the filter used by metta, and schlötterer
 <cit>  disproportionally selected less testis-biased genes in the segmental dataset.

nonetheless, metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  were aware that the testis expression data limited the analysis to d. melanogaster genes . for the cases of retroposition where the parental gene had been lost, the copy present in d. melanogaster either corresponded to the parental gene or the retrogene, depending on which species or branch the duplication occurred. using the segmental dataset and the expression criteria in
 <cit> , metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  found that only one out of five retrogenes located on an autosome is expressed  in the testis, which supported their argument for general female-biased or unbiased expression of retrogenes. however, this result was not consistent in flyatlas
 <cit>  in which three of the five retrogenes  are expressed in testis. moreover, in the excluded dataset, the only case of an autosomal retrogene  in d. melanogaster with parental x-linked gene is indeed testis-biased expressed
 <cit> .

the difference in sex-biased expression between the excluded and segmental datasets could have compromised their final 
CONCLUSIONS
 <cit> , as one should expect that data subsets would not show drastic differences in expression patterns. one possibility is that the conservative sequence similarity used to construct the segmental dataset biased their acquisition of male-biased expressed genes since in drosophila this class of genes is known to be more divergent than female-biased or unbiased expressed genes
 <cit> .

however, the conservation of sequence similarity was not the only threshold used to remove genes from the segmental dataset
 <cit> . other criteria, such as absence of introns, were also implemented
 <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the segmental dataset represents an even more confident set of relocated retrogenes. therefore, we conducted a full analysis on the excluded dataset . we found no evidence to exclude the following cases: cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig>  note that three of those genes are male-biased expressed. thus, those highly confident relocated genes contained in the excluded dataset still show a significantly higher frequency of male-biased genes than the segmental dataset . nonetheless, we focused our further analyses only in the segmental dataset used by metta and schlötterer’s
 <cit> . in the following three sections, we present several points that led us to continue to have a different conclusion.

whole-body gene expression comparison between males and females underestimated male-biased expression
\in order to test for functional equivalence among duplicate copies, metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  compared the sex-biased gene expression between retrogenes and parental copies. they used the available gene expression data from whole body of males and females in d. simulans, d. yakuba, d. ananassae, d. pseudoobscura, d. virilis and d. mojavensis <cit>  to classify those genes into different categories in terms of sex-biased expression. they found that retrogenes and parental genes usually show similar expression. indeed, almost 50%  of cases have the same sex-biased expression across all species . however, our re-analysis of the data  revealed that approximately 80% of those cases  with same sex-biased expression show no significant evidence for male- or female-biased expression. note that we used the same source to obtain information regarding male- or female- biased expression
 <cit>  . all of them are equally expressed among males and females . note that our re-analysis has shown that one additional case of relocation  has unbiased expression in d. simulans <cit>  .
 <cit> . dsim: d. simulans; dyak: d. yakuba; dana: d. ananassae; dpse: d. pseudoobscura; dvir: d. virilis; dmoj: d. mojavensis. significant female- and male-biased expression is represented in red and blue, respectively. female-biased expressed genes located on the x chromosome are shown in grey boxes. retrogenes and parental genes are shown in “r” and “p”, respectively. same sex-biased expression can be divided in: no sex-biased expression and female-biased expression for all orthologs analyzed. “-” corresponds to cases where orthologos do not show the same sex-biased expression. “na” refers to no expression data available.

the sex-biased expression data used by metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  came from a previously published article that compared whole body expression of males and females
 <cit> , whereas previous analyses of gene movement with male expression in drosophila utilized expression data from testes and ovaries
 <cit> . it was reported that the number of genes with sex-biased expression is drastically reduced in the whole body expression data of d. melanogaster <cit> . we also have previously observed that analysis of gene duplicates using whole body expression data only recovered 30% of the male-biased gene expression in d. melanogaster gonads
 <cit> . this low coverage of male-biased genes in the whole body data was also observed in anopheles gambiae <cit> . in this case an even smaller proportion of male-biased genes is observed when compared to the proportion of female-biased genes: only 7% of testis-biased expression is recovered using male whole-body rna. in contrast, 50% of ovary-biased expression is recovered when using whole-body of females
 <cit> . moreover, the number of female-biased genes can also be underestimated using whole-body rna. since those genes are widely expressed
 <cit> , the introduction of somatic tissues in the rna pool may distort the relative excess found in the ovary. therefore, the use of whole-body rna underestimates in general detection of sex-biased genes found by gonadal tissue comparisons.

metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  also claimed that 60% of genes that have heterogeneous sex-biased expression, i.e. cases in which orthologs of the same gene in different species have different sex-biased expression. moreover, they found that sex-biased expression among species show no particular pattern associated with retrogenes or parental copies . however, this result is not unexpected as only  <dig> out of the  <dig> retrogenes  displayed sex-biased expression for all species/gene combinations . we therefore reason that any conclusions regarding the relationship between sex-biased expression and chromosomal locations of retrogenes without parental genes must await additional studies using comparisons between gonads in males and females .

female-biased expression is associated with x-linkage of parental genes
metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  claimed that genes in their dataset show a high frequency of female-biased expression in contrast to the male-biased expression usually found for retrogene moving out of the x chromosome. they interpreted this lack of association and the apparent non-random gene traffic off the x to reflect a non-adaptive process. however, we found that this level of female-biased expression  is a consequence of large number of x-linked parental genes present in the dataset and therefore is not unexpected even under selection-driven models. in other words, there is an excess of the x-linked gene movement to the autosomes in their dataset. if all orthologs to the  <dig> retrogenes across the twelve drosophila species are analyzed, it is clear that there will be an enrichment of x-linked parental genes when analyzing the total expression profile . as the x chromosome in drosophila is enriched with female-biased genes
 <cit> , it is reasonable to expect a high frequency of this class of gene.

indeed, we found that most of those female-biased genes are parental genes located in the x chromosome where  <dig>  out of the  <dig> female-biased genes are located on the x chromosome and only two are retrogenes . note that two of  <dig> genes previously found to be female-biased expressed are actually unbiased expressed between males and females . in other words, a high frequency of female-biased genes as 60%  are x-linked parental genes and the x chromosome is known to be enriched with parental genes and female-biased expressed genes
 <cit> . this association can be clearly seen as an enrichment of x-linked female-biased genes for parental copies but not for retrogenes . removal of female-biased x-linked genes from table
 <dig> , results in a noticeable decrease in sex-biased expression, particularly for retrogenes:  <dig> male-biased and  <dig> female-biased expressed genes. therefore, the large number of female-biased genes associated with x-linkage of parental genes is expected from various forms of sexual antagonism
 <cit>  models and consistent with the known deficit of male-biased genes on the x chromosome and enrichment of female-biased genes
 <cit> . in other words, their finding of excess of female-biased genes is actually in agreement with proposed selection-based hypotheses connected to sex-biased expression
 <cit> .

additional gonad expression data supports selection hypothesis for movement out of the x chromosome
we searched for additional gonad expression data for the specific group of retrogenes and their parental counterparts analyzed by metta and schlötterer
 <cit> . if the selection is driving the retrogene movement out of the x chromosome, we should be able to detect lower expression in ovaries and higher expression in testis for those genes located in the autosomes in comparison to x-linked genes. however, if the movement out of the x chromosome is an intrinsic property of the retrogenes, no differences of sex-related expression should be expected.

although such assessment is not trivial given the small sample size , we were able to find significant differences in at least two independent analyses. first, using flyatlas
 <cit>  expression data for the segmental dataset of d. melanogaster , we found that parental genes are more up regulated in ovary than retrogenes . this pattern is not a result of the great number of x-linked genes found in the group of parental genes as none of the x-linked retrogenes is up regulated in the ovary . this is in contrast to the expression profile of x-linked parental genes, which are all up regulated in the female organ .

second, using two different spermatogenic expression profiles
 <cit> , we found that d. melanogaster autosomal genes described by metta and schlötterer
 <cit>   were more likely expressed in meiosis than in mitosis.
additional file 3: figure s <dig> plots the correlation between two available expression profiles in d. melanogaster spermatogenesis
 <cit> . one of the profiles corresponds to the expression fold difference found between bag-of-marbles  mutant and wild type testes
 <cit> . the bam mutation prevents the entry into meiosis stage and results in the accumulation of pre-meiotic cells
 <cit> . the other profile corresponds to the expression fold difference found between mitotic and meiotic cells dissected from wild-type testes
 <cit> . both expression profiles are significantly correlated and therefore should reproduce the expression differences between the first two phases of spermatogenesis . in the latter profile
 <cit> , the x-linked genes analyzed in metta and schlötterer’s
 <cit>  sample show a higher mitotic/meiotic expression when compared to genes located in the autosomes . this result suggests that autosomal genes are more frequently expressed in meiotic cells of the testis.

these independent analyses have shown that autosomal- and x-linked genes analyzed by metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  are not equally expressed regarding sex-related tissues: the autosomal genes tend to be less ovary-expressed and tend to show more male expression, more specifically the meiotic phases of the testis. this result is therefore in agreement with the hypothesis that selective forces such as msci, dosage compensation and sexual antagonism are involved in the retrogene movement out of the x chromosome
 <cit> . it is important to notice that the selective model does not necessarily require male-biased expression, but higher male expression of autosomal retrogenes than of their x-linked parental counterparts.

discussion
numerous studies have shown increased testis expression of retrogenes that have moved out of the x chromosome in d. melanogaster <cit> . those findings are associated with several evolutionary hypotheses in which autosomal male-biased genes have been favoured by natural selection
 <cit> . however, the recent study of metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  found no evidence of male-biased expression among retrogenes for which the parental copy has been lost. on the contrary, the genes analyzed have mostly female-biased or unbiased expression
 <cit> . as those genes also show the excessive movement out of the x chromosome, metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  suggested that such a trend is an intrinsic property of retrogenes in drosophila and not part of an adaptive process.

the segmental dataset used by metta and schlötterer
 <cit>  did not show the same proportion of testis-biased expressed genes observed in the entire dataset of retrogenes in which the parental gene was subsequently lost
 <cit> . thus it is clear that the segmental dataset used by metta and schlötterer was not representative of the entire dataset of retrogenes for which the parental copy has been lost and the authors therefore took this as evidence against selection-based hypotheses
 <cit> .

in addition, statistical analysis of gene movement and sex chromosome evolution can only be performed using tissue-specific expression profiles across species, particularly male gonads
 <cit> . however, such studies are complicated in cases where the parental copy has degenerated or has been lost. in those instances, movements of parent and retrogenes can only be inferred using genomic comparisons and phylogenetic inference between different drosophila species
 <cit> . unfortunately, expression data derived from gonad analysis do not yet exist for all genomic sequenced drosophila species .

although a previous study of whole-body expression analysis successfully detected the non-random chromosomal distribution of sex-biased genes
 <cit> , it failed to recover the known extensive male-biased expression obtained using tissue-specific data in d. melanogaster <cit> . that means whole-body expression analyses lack the statistical power needed to detect the tissue-specific basis of retrogene movement out of the x chromosome
 <cit>  probably due to the smaller sample size of this dataset in comparison to genome-wide analyses. in a previous study
 <cit> , we approached this problem by using a conservative analysis of gene movement in d. melanogaster for which gonad expression data are available
 <cit> . although the number of retrogenes was too small to conduct a statistical test, it was possible to show that x-linked parental genes for which the corresponding retrogene had moved to the autosomes were generally under-expressed in testis in agreement with sexual antagonism, msci and dosage compensation models
 <cit> . thus, hypotheses concerning the generality of retrogene movements from the x  cannot be tested with existing expression data. we must await the acquisition of appropriate tissue-specific expression data from across the drosophila clade.

however, we were able to show that there is an association of sex-biased expression with movement out of the x chromosome within the group of retrogenes analyzed by metta and schlötterer
 <cit> . first, using d. melanogaster gonad data from flyatlas
 <cit> , we found the x-linked parental genes tend to be more up regulated in ovaries than retrogenes located in the autosomes. second, autosomal genes tend to more expressed in meiotic cells of the testis in comparison to x-linked genes. those results are in agreement with the hypothesis that autosomal regions provide a favourable environment for male-expression
 <cit> .

nevertheless, it is important to notice that even if the tissue-specific data across the drosophila clade provides evidence for reduced testis-biased expression of retrogenes without parental genes compared to that of retrogenes with parental copies, it will not necessarily rule out msci, sexual antagonism, meiotic drive and dosage compensation models
 <cit> . the current sex-biased expression of retrogenes without parental gene does not necessary reflects expression levels when duplication occurred. in this model of retrotransposition, it is reasonable to assume that before the parental gene is lost, the retrogene would either complement the parental gene’s function, or undergo neo- or sub-functionalization
 <cit> . only after degeneration of the parental copy could selection favour mutations in the retrogene that gradually restore the parental function
 <cit> . therefore, for the selection-driven hypothesis, male-biased expression is only expected by the time the inter-chromosome movements have occurred.

in addition, there are several other lines of evidence supporting hypotheses that predict excessive gene movement off the x chromosome is driven by natural selection. first, the excessive gene movement out of the x chromosome is not exclusively found in retrogenes. genes created by dna-based mechanisms also show excessive out-of-the-x movement, which suggest that natural selection, rather than mutation processes intrinsic to retrotransposition, played an essential role in distributing male-biased genes
 <cit> . second, chicken and silkworm, which have zw sex determining systems, also present association between sex-bias gene expression and chromosomal gene movement. in those cases, a symmetrical pattern to the xy sex determining system is observed: genes that move out of the z chromosome tend to be ovary-biased expressed
 <cit> . therefore the phenomenon is not dependent on mutational processes intrinsic to the testis expression and therefore is more likely to be driven by natural selection. third, a recent population genomic analysis of the copy number variants of drosophila retrogenes found that there are more fixed than polymorphic retrogenes originating on the x chromosome, which provided direct and strong population genetic evidence for the positive selection hypotheses
 <cit> . fourth, it worth mentioning that several autosomal retrogenes that moved out of the drosophila x chromosome showing clear testis-specific functions have been indentified and extensively described. examples of those genes are drosophila nuclear transport factor-2-related , rcd- <dig> related  and gasket ,
 <cit> .
