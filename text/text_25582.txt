BACKGROUND
modern inhaled corticosteroids are currently the most effective drugs used in long-term asthma therapy, combining potent anti-inflammatory activity with fast metabolic inactivation  <cit> . inhaled corticosteroids can reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness, asthma symptoms, frequency of asthma exacerbations, and improve lung function and quality of life  <cit> . on the other hand, long-term treatment with inhaled corticosteroids can be associated with systemic adverse effects, such as cortisol suppression, formation of cataracts, decreased bone density, and growth suppression in children  <cit> .

the efficacy of an inhaled corticosteroid and its potential to cause systemic adverse effects are based on its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties  <cit> . these properties are determined by the reversible binding of the drug to the glucocorticoid receptor, which is present in almost all cell types  <cit> . thus, local therapeutic benefits as well as unwanted adverse effects are mediated by the same receptor  <cit> .

ciclesonide is a new generation inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis  <cit> . in contrast to other inhaled corticosteroids that bind directly to the glucocorticoid receptor, e.g. fluticasone propionate, ciclesonide is a prodrug with almost no receptor binding affinity. airway esterases convert ciclesonide to its pharmacologically active metabolite desisobutyryl-ciclesonide , which has a 100-fold higher binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor than its parent compound  <cit> . the receptor binding affinity varies among inhaled corticosteroids and is expressed as the binding affinity relative to dexamethasone with an affinity of  <dig>  <cit> . des-cic and fluticasone propionate are among the most potent corticosteroids with binding affinities relative to dexamethasone of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

before a corticosteroid is able to bind to its receptor, it has to pass through the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane. the efficacy of an inhaled corticosteroid therefore also depends on its efficient uptake into the cell. several features of the drug, such as the size of the molecule, charge, and lipophilicity play a role in its ability to cross this barrier. high lipophilicity may also enhance receptor binding affinity and this property correlates highly with the volume of distribution and pulmonary retention time of the drug  <cit> . prolonging the time that a drug is available in the lung may enhance its anti-inflammatory activity. the conjugation of a corticosteroid with highly lipophilic fatty acids in the pulmonary tissue is a mechanism by which the retention time of a drug is increased  <cit> . the ester bond between the corticosteroid and the fatty acid is formed via a hydroxyl group at position c- <dig>  <cit> . des-cic, but not fluticasone propionate, has the required group at position c- <dig> . conjugates of des-cic with oleic and palmitic acid have been found in vitro and in vivo in rat and human lung tissues  <cit> . the formation of these pharmacologically inactive des-cic fatty acid esters is a reversible process  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to investigate the uptake of ciclesonide in human alveolar typeii epithelial cells, using the human-lung derived carcinoma a <dig> cell line as an established in vitro model for studying drug metabolism and delivery in the lung epithelium  <cit> . ciclesonide uptake was compared with the uptake of fluticasone propionate, a potent and widely used inhaled corticosteroid  <cit> . in addition, the in vitro metabolism of ciclesonide in a <dig> cells was examined, to evaluate the formation of the pharmacologically active metabolite des-cic and its conjugation with fatty acids in human lung epithelial cells.

RESULTS
uptake of ciclesonide and fluticasone propionate in a <dig> cells
the mean intracellular concentrations of ciclesonide and fluticasone propionate determined by lc/ms/ms analysis after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min of incubation are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  after  <dig> min, most of the ciclesonide was not metabolized. the parent compound accounted for 96% of the total amount of ciclesonide . at this time point, the total concentration of ciclesonide in a <dig> cells was  <dig> -fold higher than the concentration of fluticasone propionate; the difference was statistically significant . at all other time points, the concentration of ciclesonide was numerically higher when compared with fluticasone propionate .

a)  <dig> dishes per time point

b) conjugates of des-cic with palmitic acid were almost undetectable.

in vitro metabolism of ciclesonide in a <dig> cells
because the majority of ciclesonide  was not metabolized during  <dig> min of incubation, we investigated the metabolism of ciclesonide during a longer period of time. the mean intracellular concentrations of the parent compound ciclesonide, its active metabolite des-cic and fatty acid conjugates of des-cic after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h of drug-free incubation are shown in figure  <dig>  ciclesonide concentrations decreased over time from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/dish after  <dig> h to approximately 1/10th of that level after  <dig> h . the mean intracellular concentrations of des-cic remained about constant during the 24-h incubation period, with values of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/dish after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of incubation. lipid conjugates of des-cic with oleic acid and palmitic acid were detected. at all time points, the main metabolite of ciclesonide was des-cic-oleate. the concentrations of the des-cic fatty acid conjugates in the a <dig> cells increased over time. des-cic-oleate concentrations increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/dish after  <dig> h to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/dish after  <dig> h of incubation. des-cic-palmitate concentrations were much lower, but showed an increase from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/dish to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/dish measured after  <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively.

discussion
in asthma therapy, alveolar epithelial cells are one of the most important targets for inhaled corticosteroids, because these cells are involved in the secretion of many pro-inflammatory proteins  <cit> . thus, the efficient uptake of an inhaled corticosteroid into these cells is a prerequisite for the exertion of its anti-inflammatory activity. the human epithelial lung adenocarcinoma cell line a <dig> provides a useful model for drug transport and metabolic processes in epithelial type ii cells  <cit> . in this study we evaluated the uptake efficiency of the two corticosteroids ciclesonide and fluticasone propionate into a <dig> cells and investigated the metabolism of ciclesonide in this cell type.

after incubation, significantly higher concentrations of ciclesonide than fluticasone propionate were detected in a <dig> cells, suggesting a more efficient uptake of ciclesonide into the cells . these observations might be correlated with the lipophilicity of the compounds. high lipophilicity facilitates the passage of the drug through the phospholipid bilayer of the cell. the logd  values at ph  <dig>  are  <dig>  for ciclesonide and  <dig>  for fluticasone propionate, indicating that ciclesonide has a  <dig> -fold higher lipophilicity compared with fluticasone propionate.

binding of drugs to plasma proteins is another factor that may affect the uptake of drugs into cells. in the systemic circulation, 99% of ciclesonide and 90% of fluticasone propionate are protein-bound  <cit> , leading to the assumption that in vivo more unbound fluticasone propionate is available for uptake compared with ciclesonide. however, the protein content of the incubation media in these experiments was  <dig> % bsa, which is lower than the protein content in the systemic circulation. furthermore, the exact protein concentration in vivo on the surface of alveolar cells is not known. therefore, it is not certain whether the difference in protein binding between the two corticosteroids might have an influence on the results of this study.

after the uptake into the a <dig> cells, ciclesonide is converted by airway esterases to its pharmacologically active metabolite des-cic, which is then conjugated with fatty acids. during the 24-h drug-free incubation period, the intracellular levels of des-cic remained stable, while ciclesonide concentrations decreased to trace amounts at  <dig> h and levels of des-cic fatty acid conjugates increased over time. des-cic-oleate was the major fatty acid conjugate, and after  <dig> h of drug-free incubation, the major compound detected. similar results were reported previously in vitro for precision-cut human lung slices and for human lung tissue after in vivo inhalation of ciclesonide  <cit> . the total amount of intracellular ciclesonide  remained stable over the  <dig> h of drug-free incubation. in a previous study using similar experimental conditions, the anti-inflammatory potency of des-cic in a <dig> cells was demonstrated by the inhibition of cytokine production  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, this study demonstrated that ciclesonide is effectively taken up into human alveolar type ii epithelial  cells and metabolized to its pharmacologically active metabolite des-cic and fatty acid conjugates of des-cic. levels of des-cic remained constant over a  <dig> h period, possibly because des-cic may be formed from either ciclesonide or des-cic-oleate. fatty acid esters are much more lipophilic compared with the parent compound ciclesonide  <cit> . these inactive esters remain in the cells, where they reconvert to the active metabolite, thus prolonging the exposure time and local anti-inflammatory activity of ciclesonide in the lung. the slow-release pool of active drug may contribute to the proven efficacy of once-daily inhaled ciclesonide in asthma therapy, as was shown in several clinical studies  <cit> .
