BACKGROUND
given the nonspecific clinical symptoms of sepsis, especially in its early stages, and the need for rapid implementation of appropriate therapy, microbiological and laboratory testing is of importance. the key role in diagnostics is determining the etiological agent of infection. until now, the so-called diagnostic “gold standard” is still blood cultures performed in specialized media, preferably in automated culture systems. an important advantage of blood cultures is their low cost of testing. however, the long period of waiting for the results, in relation to the need for rapid implementation of appropriate antibiotic therapy, is undoubtedly a disadvantage of this method. the downside is also its low sensitivity – positive blood culture results, despite the presence of clinical signs of sepsis, are obtained in less than 50% of cases  <cit> . the situation is further exacerbated by subjecting patients to antibiotherapy before the collection of blood samples for culture – patients are often treated with antibiotics before the symptoms of sepsis manifest themselves. in such cases, cultures from blood are very difficult to perform due to the fact that it contains antibiotics inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. the detection of microbial nucleic acids is promising for effective, accurate and prompt diagnostics of bloodstream infections. the sensitivity of molecular methods is much higher than the sensitivity of the culture method, and, what is more, prior employment of antibiotherapy does not affect the test results  <cit> . unfortunately, methods of molecular biology also have their limitations. the difficulty is caused by the isolation of dna of suitable quality and high concentration from blood. an essential step in isolating dna from blood is bacterial and fungal cell wall lysis of its cells present in the blood. however, bacteria and fungi display varying susceptibility to lysis. the wall of gram-positive bacteria and fungi is thick and resistant to degradation, which results in the necessity of employing mechanical disruption, chemical lysis, and thermal lysis  <cit> . another problem is the amplification of microbial dna isolated from blood which can be inhibited by heme, its main component. this compound causes dissociation of dna polymerase which results in disintegration of enzyme–substrate complex, and, additionally, it blocks its catalytic pocket  <cit> . the listed difficulties cause the market to lack solutions which have applications in molecular diagnostics of sepsis. although it is possible to point out septifast  kit which, however, does not exhaust the possibilities offered by the application of the diagnostic method based on pcr  <cit> . septifast  allows the detection of ten to twenty species of bacteria and fungi, whose presence is most often confirmed in patients’ blood. however, if sepsis is triggered by a bacterial or fungal etiological agent from outside the list, the septifast kit will generate a negative test result, which may mislead the physician.

consequently, the aim of the study was to develop an alternative nested, multiplex, real time pcr  method serving to detect the presence of microbes in blood in order to diagnose sepsis.

RESULTS
primers design
four external primer sequences have been designed. their sequences are presented in table  <dig>  a test of the designed primers was performed on dna isolated from the reference strains of the bacterial and fungal species listed in the section “reference microbial strains” and amplification signal was obtained for all species, with no cross-reaction of primers specific for bacteria to fungal dna and vice versa. the designed primers correctly typed the studied reference strains species as belonging to the groups of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, yeast fungi, or filamentous fungi.

the multiplex real-time pcr amplification standardization
the annealing temperature of the primers  was determined to be  <dig> °c and for amplification ii –  <dig> °c . afterwards, it was arranged that magnesium ion concentration should equal  <dig>  mm for amplification i and  <dig>  mm for amplification ii. compositions of the reaction mixtures were presented in table  <dig>  concentration of the used reagents were as follows: external primers  –  <dig> μm; internal primers  –  <dig> μm; taqman probes  –  <dig> μm; buffer b 10× ; dntp’s  –  <dig> mm; mgcl <dig>  –  <dig> mm; perpetual taq polymerase  <dig>  u/μl . dna amplification was carried out under the following thermal conditions for amplification i: 95°c for  <dig> min   <dig> cycles and for amplification ii: 95°c for  <dig> min   <dig> cycles.

evaluation of the qpcr method sensitivity
the indication of sensitivity was performed separately for amplification ii  and in the nested system, i.e. in successive amplifications i and ii. the obtained results were compared in table  <dig>  these results allow us to conclude that the use of amplification in the nested system, i.e. successive amplifications i and ii, gives us the possibility to increase the detection sensitivity by two orders of magnitude for reference strains of filamentous, yeast fungi and for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in comparison with amplification ii alone – functioning as an independent reaction.

the study of blood samples from patients using the method of nested-multiplex qpcr, multiplex qpcr and microbiological blood culture
 <dig> blood samples from patients with clinical symptoms of sepsis were examined with the use of the developed method in the nested multiplex system and of bact/alert® 3d  blood culture. the application of the developed method for microbial detection allowed to increase the percentage of positive results from  <dig> % as for culture to  <dig> % in the case of nested-multiplex qpcr . the elaborated pcr method enabled us to confirm the results of blood culture in every case and assign group membership, being gram-positive bacteria or gram-negative bacteria – yeast fungi presence was confirmed in one case only by pcr . mutliplex qpcr  gave results of  <dig> % which is a value slightly lower than in the case of using culture methods and just as nested pcr confirm the results of blood culture. in all  <dig> samples, amplification signal in negative control was not obtained, which guarantees absence of contamination. a detailed compilation of the results is presented in table  <dig>

discussion
molecular diagnostics of microbial etiological agents of sepsis is currently at an initial stage and is limited more to scientific research than to diagnostic practice. only few kits for the detection of microorganisms that cause sepsis are available on the market: septifast  and septitest , but in no way do they satisfy the needs of molecular sepsis diagnostics  <cit> . the septifast  system enables the detection of more than a dozen specific microbial species, while septitest  theoretically allows to detect every possible microorganism species, but sequencing of the pcr product is required, which increases the cost and prolongs the wait for the result.

the starting point for the design of the described nested-multiplex qpcr method was the work describing the application of the qpcr method to detect bacteria and fungi in biological materials separately – bispo et al. described the pcr methodology in the detection of bacteria with gram differentiation in the vitreous humor, and sugita et al. described the pcr method for the detection of yeast and filamentous fungi in the eyeball when it is inflamed  <cit> . during the work carried out by our team, it was possible to combine the sequences of primers and probes described by the authors into a multiplex reaction for simultaneous detection of bacteria and fungi with their differentiation into gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, yeast fungi, and filamentous fungi. the results of sensitivity determination of such a method in the multiplex system has shown that it is possible to achieve the detection threshold of  <dig>  × 102 cfu/ml to  <dig>  × 103 cfu/ml depending on the group of microorganisms . the resulting sensitivity was lower than the one obtained using septifast  test with which one can detect the presence of individual microorganisms at the level of: 3 × 100 cfu/ml for e. coli, 3 × 101 cfu/ml for s. aureus, 3 × 101 cfu/ml for c. albicans and 3 × 100 cfu/ml for a. fumigatus <cit> . in order to increase the sensitivity of the detection method in the multiplex qpcr system, a preliminary amplification procedure  was designed so as to gain an opportunity to carry out detection of the presence of bacteria and fungi in the nested multiplex qpcr system. the designed primer sequences and amplification procedure related to their use allowed to reduce the detection threshold to approximately 101 cfu/ml for all of the four examined groups of microorganisms . the resulting sensitivity is slightly lower than in the case of septifast  test, but it should be taken into account that the number of cells of bacteria and fungi amplified in the pcr reaction oscillate at a maximum of  <dig>  cfu/reaction, suggesting getting closer to the detection limit for the established conditions of nested-multiplex qpcr amplification . furthermore, in the septifast  system, internal transcribed spacer  was used as a target region for differentiating species of bacteria and fungi, and not the sequences of 16s rrna and 18s rrna as in the nested multiplex qpcr method; consequently, it is not possible to directly compare the parameters of both methods  <cit> .

the examination of blood samples from patients with clinical symptoms of sepsis, with the use of the developed methodology, gave a percentage of positive results of  <dig> % compared to  <dig> % obtained with the method of blood culture in the monitored culture system . this is a considerable difference, which may raise the suspicion of false positive results, but which seems unlikely, given the use of negative control, that in each case gave a negative result. specialized, universal media have been used in blood culture for bact/alert® 3d system  which could prevent the growth of certain microbial species . this could impact on the low percentage of positive results in the blood culture method. a large proportion of positive samples indicates high sensitivity of the nested-multiplex qpcr method in the diagnostics of microbiological agents that cause sepsis, but it should be remembered that the samples came from patients who experienced clinical signs of sepsis, so there was a high probability of bacteremia or fungemia. similar results have been shown by chang et al. in their study using septifast  test, in which they demonstrated the presence of bacteria in 75% of blood samples  <cit> . on the other hand, the use of nested pcr increases the risk of contamination of samples, which may lead to a more frequent appearance of false positive results. therefore, samples which are positive by nested pcr, but negative by culture may be tested by a third method  in order to rule out contamination. the blood culture methods, even in automated systems, do not allow to obtain positive results of the culture in the majority of cases, which does not exclude sepsis in patients  <cit> . the detection of microorganisms in blood by multiplex qpcr and its sensitivity were significantly lower . obviously, such results may suggest an occurrence of contamination while drawing the blood sample, when bacteria from the skin get into the sample. these are revealed at the same time as the relevant etiological agent of sepsis using the much more sensitive pcr method. in such a situation, it would be necessary to differentiate the amplification signal strength, to separate signals coming from the contamination.

CONCLUSIONS
the method presented in this paper is based on a combination of the nested and multiplex pcr methods in order to obtain higher sensitivity; additionally, the method allows to extend its scope over the whole panel of bacterial and fungal microorganisms , but without typing specific species. this information is very useful to the physician when selecting the appropriate treatment before he receives the final identification from microbiological laboratory.
