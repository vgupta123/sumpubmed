BACKGROUND
several signaling pathways have been identified which promote the characteristic features of apoptotic cell death, including cell shrinkage, translocation of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, internucleosomal dna fragmentation and budding leading to disintegration into apoptotic bodies  <cit> . the biochemical and cellular mechanisms involved depend on the apoptogenic stimulus and may also be specific to the experimental model  <cit> . in contrast to other agents able to induce apoptosis, ca2+ ionophore a <dig> elicits direct activation of intracellular signal. a <dig> provokes caspase-independent apoptosis in jurkat cells, which differs from fas cross-linking by antibodies  <cit> . however, the apoptotic pathways induced by a <dig>  dependent on extracellular ca2+ ions  <cit> , remain a matter of debate  <cit> . although the effect of a <dig> on gene transcription had been documented for various genes, there were no experimental data available on the overall pattern of gene expression in cells grown in the presence of this agent.

scott syndrome is an extremely rare hereditary defect of swift egress  of phosphatidylserine to the cell surface of stimulated platelets and blood cells, when challenged by stimuli resulting in rapid elevation of cytosolic ca2+ concentration  <cit> , and the clinical phenotype is hemorrhagic  <cit> . functional studies performed with b lymphocytes immortalized by epstein-barr virus -transformation  derived from three unrelated scott syndrome patients demonstrated the same deficiency of rapid membrane response and suggested alteration in  ca2+-dependent transduction pathway  <cit> . another characteristic of cultured scott b lymphoblasts is a spontaneous tendency to apoptosis that is enhanced when a <dig> is added to the culture medium  <cit> . we previously demonstrated using several methods that addition of  <dig> nm a <dig> for  <dig> hours in the culture medium induced apoptosis in scott b lymphoblasts more markedly than observed in control b cell lines  <cit> . it has been currently observed that cells originating from patients with genetic diseases or acquired pathologies may exhibit either spontaneous susceptibility or resistance to apoptosis, allowing the study of the role of the defective genes in the corresponding apoptotic processes  <cit> . the scott b lymphoblasts thus appeared to constitute a unique model for the global investigation of changes in gene expression patterns during apoptosis and search of mutation possibly accounting for the hemorrhagic phenotype associated with the syndrome.

in order to understand what controls the apoptogenic potential of the ionophore we examined by dna microarray analysis whether a <dig> provoked changes in the transcriptional patterns for  <dig>  different mrna sequences. we simultaneously checked if differential modulation of gene expression could account for the enhanced susceptibility of scott b lymphoblasts to apoptosis as compared to b lymphoblasts derived from the patient's daughter or unrelated individuals. a change of expression of  <dig> genes was observed, including the coordinated repression of a set of  <dig> genes mostly involved in cell cycle progress. our data illustrated that a23187-induced apoptosis correlates with transcriptional regulation of multiple genes and that global profiling analyses are important approaches for a better understanding of the involved mechanism. the results also showed a more pronounced gene repression in scott b lymphoblasts, suggesting that the defect implies an element involved in  signal transduction pathway promoting a23187-induced transcriptional regulation of cell cycle genes.

RESULTS
apoptotic characteristics of scott b lymphoblasts
spontaneous cell mortality of scott b lymphoblasts in vitro has been previously shown  <cit>  as well as their high susceptibility to  <dig> nm ca2+ ionophore a23187-induced apoptosis  <cit> . we confirmed using the cells cultured for the present study, the apoptogenic effect of the treatment for all b lymphoblasts  and the much higher amount of apoptotic scott b lymphoblasts in basal medium and upon addition of a <dig> 

identification of  <dig> genes that are transcriptionally modulated in b lymphoblasts cultured in the presence of a23187
the selection criteria for analyses of the hybridization data as defined in the methods section enabled identification of  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed with a two-fold change or more of gene expression, after treatment of b lymphoblasts with  <dig> nm ca2+ ionophore a <dig> for  <dig> hours . hierarchical clustering  <cit>   and comparison of the fold change values , showed one group of  <dig> genes characterized by transcriptional activation  and another group of  <dig> genes by repressed transcription .

up-regulation of  <dig> genes
the activation of transcription for each one of the  <dig> up-regulated genes respectively appeared to be mostly of comparable amplitude in the three scott, daughter's and control b lymphoblasts cell lines. these genes belong to various functional categories, coding for cytokines, transcription or growth factors and proteins of cell metabolism . hybridization ratios comparing the expression levels, in the absence of a <dig>  in scott and daughter's relative to the control b lymphoblasts , suggested that in some cases, such as for expression of scm- <dig> or macrophage-derived chemokine, different up-regulation values for a given gene reflected variable basal expression. the effect of the treatment  then appeared to be more effective when the basal expression was low. sixteen up-regulated genes were basally expressed differently  and the others were similarly expressed in the three cell lines before a <dig> treatment.

down-regulation of  <dig> genes mostly coding for histones and proteins involved in the cell cycle
a significant fold change for repression of the  <dig> down-regulated genes mostly occurred in a23187-treated scott b lymphoblasts when compared with control b lymphoblasts for which repression was of lower amplitude . these genes mostly code for histones and for proteins involved in the progression of the cell cycle. sets of genes coding for essential components of the molecular mechanisms involved in movements of organelles, microtubules or chromosomes and for proteins participating in the cell cycle at the level of dna replication, repair and recombination or nucleotide synthesis were also down-regulated in a23187-treated cells. fold change values found in daughter's cells were either intermediate when compared to scott and control b lymphoblasts, or similar to control.

the comparison of the expression levels of these genes in scott and daughter's relative to control b lymphoblasts in the absence of a <dig> indicated a reduced basal expression of a subset of  <dig> genes in scott b lymphoblasts . these genes code for  <dig> histones and for cdkn2c, b-myb and thymidine kinase . the other down-regulated genes were similarly transcribed in the three cell lines in basal culture conditions.

independent verification of array findings
to validate the microarray results, we measured the relative expression of an arbitrarily chosen subset of nine of the identified genes by real-time quantitative rt-pcr on new rna preparations and rt . results confirmed the up-regulation of expression in the presence of a <dig> of the genes coding for ifn-inducible gamma  <dig> , argininosuccinate synthetase  and siah <dig>  the expression differences were of the same range values as those measured by microarrays analysis for wars and siah <dig>  much higher values  were measured for ass, demonstrating that for determining high difference levels the microarrays data saturate at lower values than those resulting from quantitative rt-pcr. determination of mrna levels using quantitative rt-pcr for six down-regulated genes confirmed the fold change values found in the microarrays analyses and demonstrated the stronger repression in scott b lymphoblasts . these data provide validation of the gene expression changes identified by microarrays.

treatment with a <dig> alters cell cycle progression
cell cycle analyses were performed in order to check whether the decrease in expression of histones and cell cycle-related genes in a23187-treated cells correlated with changes in cell cycle progression. the cells continued to cycle in the presence of  <dig> nm a <dig>  although 10% decrease of populations in s phase was observed, suggesting partial blockade from g <dig> to s in all of the three cell lines . however, cell cycle profiles for a23187-treated scott, daughter's and control b lymphoblasts were differently affected. scott cells exhibited a 2-fold increase of cells in g2/m and a very low enhancement of cells in g <dig>  conversely, with few changes in the number of cells in g2/m, the number of control b lymphoblasts in g <dig> was increased in the presence of a <dig>  coinciding with diminished proportion of cells in s phase. intermediate values were found for daughter's b lymphoblasts. therefore, it appears that treatment with a <dig> modifies the cell cycle with, in scott cells, a marked increase in g2/m populations in correlation with blocked progression to g <dig> 

discussion
the spontaneous tendency to apoptosis is presumably a consequence of the still unknown mutation in scott b lymphoblasts rather than due to ebv transformation. other cases have been described, showing that ebv-transformed b cell lines, independently of viral transformation, retain the original characters of the b lymphocytes from which they originate  <cit> . indeed, several b lymphoblast cell lines derived from the patient with scott syndrome having provided the cells for this study as well as from the first described isolated case, all present a spontaneous tendency to apoptosis in culture  <cit> . therefore, we expected that a better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the spontaneous and a23187-induced apoptosis in scott b lymphoblasts would be helpful for the identification of candidate gene for the mutation.

previous reports on the effects of a <dig> on a variety of cultured cells pointed at apoptosis associated with induction of early response genes partly dependent only on caspase/bcl- <dig> pathways  <cit> . however the signaling pathways controlling a23187-induced cell death are not known. several studies have demonstrated that ca2+ ionophores are able to regulate gene transcription in vitro but the effects varied according to concentration, time course of the treatment and cell type  <cit> . in this study, although a possible effect of a <dig> treatment for  <dig> h on the stability of the various mrnas cannot be excluded, the fact that groups of genes were modulated in the same directions suggests transcriptional regulation. these genes could be, at least in part, regulated as downstream targets for early response genes coding for transcription factors or regulators.

execution of apoptosis can be regulated by specific transcriptional factors and further modulated by cytokine-triggered signaling pathways  <cit> . the cytokines up-regulated in this study are markers of lymphocyte activation and mediators of inflammation  <cit>  and may play a role in the modification of the b lymphoblasts leading to cell death. additional genes up-regulated by a23187-treatment  code for proteins involved in cell proliferation  <cit> , metabolism, protein synthesis, translation, tumor cell proliferation or transcription and may either promote cell death  <cit>  or be markers of phenotypic changes. the up-regulated genes mostly appear to be similarly expressed and modulated in all of the three b cell lines and one could assume at least a partial role for these genes in the apoptotic characters of the treated cells although the importance of a specific gene cannot be deduced from this study. for instance, all the proteins coded by the three up-regulated genes analyzed to validate the microarrays data  were all demonstrated in other studies to be either involved in apoptosis or anti-proliferation  <cit>  and/or markers of induction by interferon gamma  <cit> .

several mechanisms may simultaneously participate in the specific effects of a <dig> on gene regulation, depending on the transcription machinery of individual genes. our study further demonstrated that the treatment of scott b lymphoblasts with a <dig> provokes a down-regulation of a restricted set of  <dig> different genes. the transcription level of these genes was repressed more than two-fold in a23187-treated scott b lymphoblasts and also decreased, although to lower extent, in daughter's and control b lymphoblasts.

interestingly, at least  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes code for proteins involved in the formation of essential complexes during the onset of cell cycle or in cell cycle progress, and  <dig> of them code for histones. genes expressing positive and negative regulators of the cell cycle were repressed, suggesting a complex effect of the treatment on cycle progression. among the repressed genes are those coding for the cyclin-dependent serine-threonine kinase cdc <dig> and the subunit cyclins a and b, each being involved in the control of entry into mitosis and cell cycle advancement  <cit> . remarkably, the gene encoding the cyclin-selective ubiquitin carrier, which participates in the destruction of cyclins a and b promoting exit from mitosis into g <dig> of the next cell cycle  <cit> , is also repressed. several down-regulated genes, coding for serine/threonine kinases , are implicated in the segregation of chromosomes during mitotic cell division  <cit> . other genes code for transcription factors or regulators, such as b-myb, which are important for chromosome segregation  <cit> .

decrease of histones h <dig> ,  <dig> h2a and  <dig> h2b expression is a characteristic feature observed in a23187-treated cells, including daughter's and control b lymphoblasts. histones, of which genes are transcriptionally modulated as the cell cycle progresses, play key roles in the structural and transcriptional properties of the chromatin  <cit> . if the repressed genes are regulated at the transcriptional level in a coordinated fashion, one may hypothesize that common promoter elements may direct the observed pattern of regulation. remarkably, expression of a large portion of the down-regulated genes is controlled by member of the e2f family transcription factors. among these genes are histones, cyclins a and b, b-myb, cdc <dig>  bub <dig>  thymidine kinase, dihydrofolate reductase, top <dig>  flap endonuclease <dig>  <cit> . e2f-dp <dig> heterodimers, essential for the g1/s phase transition bind to promoter elements and are negatively regulated by the hypo-phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein rb  <cit> . a role for e2f in regulating gene expression of several histones subtypes correlates with the presence of consensus sequences for e2f binding in the shared h2a/h2b promoters  <cit> . however, the location of these sequences in the promoter domain is closer to the h2a side rather than to that of h2b . this observation, together with the fact that only a restricted fraction of the known e2f target genes were repressed, suggests complex regulatory mechanisms for transcriptional regulation of genes down-regulated in the presence of a <dig> 

the data suggest a link between g0/g <dig> or g2/m cell cycle arrests and apoptosis. similar relationships were previously demonstrated through various studies . furthermore, the individual inhibition or knock-down of several genes repressed in the presence of a <dig>  such as top <dig> or lamin b <dig>  was shown to induce apoptosis in hela cells  <cit> . our results suggest that the down-regulation of cell cycle genes explains, at least partly, the apoptogenic effect of a <dig>  although the analysis of the cell cycle phases did not show significant differences between the three b cell lines under basal conditions, a <dig> treatment clearly changed the cell cycle profiles for all cell types. the presence of a <dig> in culture medium diminished the transcription of genes important for progression of the cell cycle at the g <dig> phase correlating with an increase of cells in g <dig> and decrease of s phase cells. this was observed in all cell types, correlating with the down-regulation of cell cycle genes, although with lower change levels in daughter's cells and controls. moreover, significant blockade of cells in g2/m phase was mainly observed for scott and  daughter's b lymphoblasts.

networks linking signaling and cell proliferation have now been widely described, connecting for instance ras effector/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway with the rb/e2f pathway, controlling either cell proliferation, differentiation, cell growth arrest or apoptosis  <cit> . these observations suggest that the expression pattern of the genes down-regulated by a <dig> is associated with the apoptotic tendency of the cultured scott b lymphoblasts. the present work leads to the hypothesis that a mutation in scott cells would reside in a signaling pathway component shared by the membrane remodeling process and the transcriptional regulation of a subset of cell cycle genes upon addition of the ca2+ ionophore.

CONCLUSIONS
the apoptogenic effect due to the addition to cultured cells of  <dig> nm a <dig> for  <dig> hours correlates with an overall pattern of gene regulation involving at least a hundred genes and demonstrating the coordinated regulation of sets of them. analysis of gene regulation upon treatment also represented a new approach to understand the still unexplained defective mechanism in scott cells. the results orientate the future work toward the exploration of a signaling defect in scott b lymphoblasts upstream of the transcriptional machinery for genes participating in cell cycle progress and down-regulated with the treatment.
