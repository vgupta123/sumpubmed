BACKGROUND
c- <dig>  also called lidamycin, is a chromoprotein antitumor antibiotic produced by streptomyces globisporus c- <dig>  <cit> . as a member of the enediyne family characterized by two acetylenic groups conjugated to a double bond within a 9- or 10-membered ring, c- <dig> is  <dig>  times more potent than adriamycin, one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents  <cit> . c- <dig> is a complex consisting of a 1: <dig> non-covalently associated mixture of an apoprotein and a 9-membered enediyne chromophore. the chromophore of the enediyne family can undergo a rearrangement to form a transient benzenoid diradical species that can abstract hydrogen atoms from dna to initiate a cascade leading to dna breaks, ultimately leading to cell death  <cit> . this novel mode of action has attracted great interest in developing these compounds into therapeutic agents for cancer. a cd <dig> monoclonal antibody -calicheamicin  conjugate  and neocarzinostatin  conjugated with poly   were approved in the usa  <cit>  and in japan  <cit> , respectively. recently, c- <dig> has entered phase ii clinical trial in china  <cit> . appreciation of the immense pharmacological potential of enediynes has led to a demand for the economical production of c- <dig> and its analogues at an industrial scale.

control of secondary metabolite production in streptomycetes and related actinomycetes is a complex process involving multiple levels of regulation in response to environmental factors . in most cases that have been studied in detail, the final checkpoint in production of a secondary metabolite is a pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory gene situated in the biosynthetic cluster. remarkable progress has been made in dissecting the functions of the pathway-specific regulators. for example, actii-orf <dig> regulates transcription from the actinorhodin biosynthetic genes of s. coelicolor  <cit>  and strr controls the streptomycin biosynthetic cluster of s. griseus  <cit> . recently, along with the tremendous increase in sequence information for secondary metabolic gene clusters, more and more clusters with multiple cluster-situated regulators were reported . the best studied multiple pathway-specific regulatory cascade involves remarkably five regulatory genes in tylosin biosynthetic gene cluster of s. fradiae, and a model for their regulation has been proposed  <cit> . deciphering the complexity of these pathway-specific regulatory networks is of great interest not only for better understanding of the antibiotic regulatory mechanism, but also for providing new strategy for targeted genetic engineering of antibiotic producing strains.

c- <dig> nonpeptidic chromophore is a structure of an enediyne core, a deoxy aminosugar, a β-amino acid and a benzoxazolinate   <cit> . the biosynthetic gene cluster for c- <dig>  which is the first cloned enediyne gene cluster, contains a total of  <dig> open reading frames  in a region of  <dig> kbp  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis and biochemical studies revealed a distinct iterative type i enediyne polyketide synthase  and provided a convergent biosynthetic strategy for c- <dig> from four biosynthetic building blocks  <cit> . further cloning and characterization of biosynthetic gene clusters for four other enediynes   <cit>  and dynemicin  <cit> ) confirmed the unifying paradigm for enediyne biogenesis. in accordance with the complexity of the biosynthetic process, there are no fewer than three orfs annotated as transcriptional regulators in each known enediyne antibiotic biosynthetic cluster. at least three putative regulatory genes  associated with the c- <dig> biosynthetic gene cluster of s. globisporus c- <dig> were annotated in the earlier work by sequence analysis  <cit> . furthermore, the biosynthetic gene clusters for two 9-membered enediynes produced by streptomycetes  show high similarity in the organization of genes around these regulatory genes . despite chromophore structural uniqueness, all homologues of three genes are located adjacent to the genes of enediyne pkss  and the tailoring enzymes , which are responsible for the biosynthesis of enediyne core. however, almost no cognitional knowledge was acquired about the transcriptional regulation of enediyne antibiotic production prior to the present work.

hereby we investigated the role of sgcr <dig> in c- <dig> biosynthesis, and provided an initial understanding of pathway-specific regulatory network of sgcr <dig>  sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig> in s. globisporus c- <dig> 

RESULTS
overexpression of sgcr <dig> increased the production of c-1027
computer-assisted analysis of the sgcr <dig> gene product  showed a high sequence similarity  within the whole length of protein tylr of s. fradiae , a pathway-specific global activator of tyl cluster  <cit> . to investigate the function of sgcr <dig>  the expression plasmid of sgcr <dig> associated with its native promoter, named pkcr <dig> , was constructed based on the multi-copy pkc <dig>  <cit>  and then introduced into s. globisporus c- <dig> by conjugation. thereafter, the resultant sgcr <dig> overexpression strains were fermented by incubation in liquid medium fmc-1027- <dig> . the antibacterial bioassay against bacillus subtilis cmcc  <dig>  and the hplc analysis indicated that the pkcr <dig> led to a 30–40% increase in c- <dig> production  in comparison to that in wild type strain , whereas c- <dig> production level detected in the wild type strain with the parental vector pkc <dig> had no difference. therefore, the result suggested that the function of sgcr <dig> could be positive for c- <dig> biosynthesis in s. globisporus c- <dig> 

inactivation and complementation of sgcr3
in order to ascertain the contribution of sgcr <dig> to the regulation of c- <dig> biosynthesis, a part of coding region of sgcr <dig>  was replaced with a thiostrepton resistant gene  to create the sgcr <dig> disrupted strain s. globisporus r3ko . successful disruption of the intended target was confirmed by pcr using primers complementary to one end of tsr and to untouched dna outside the disruption constructs . southern blot analyses authenticated the site-specific disruptions of sgcr <dig> using left arm for crossover and deleted part of sgcr <dig> gene as probes respectively . the antibacterial bioassay against b. subtilis  and hplc analysis  showed that disruption of sgcr <dig> completely abolished c- <dig> production.

to confirm that the disruption of sgcr <dig> was indeed responsible for the abolition of c- <dig> production, the mutant was complemented with sgcr <dig> gene. three sgcr <dig> expression plasmids  were introduced into r3ko mutant by conjugation respectively. psetr <dig> and plr <dig>  both based on the plasmid pset <dig>  <cit>  integrating into the Φc <dig> attb site on the chromosome, had a copy of sgcr <dig> controlled by its native promoter and a strong constitutive promoter erme*p respectively. the resultant strains with pkcr <dig>  and psetr <dig>  restored the c- <dig> production and showed dose proportionality as expected. the strain containing plr <dig> in which sgcr <dig> was controlled by erme*p showed less production of c- <dig>  compared with the strain containing psetr <dig>  no production of c- <dig> was detected for the r3ko mutants transformed with pkc <dig> and pset <dig> . these results, fully consistent with those obtained upon overexpression of sgcr <dig> gene, confirmed the positive regulatory role of sgcr <dig> in c- <dig> biosynthesis.

gene expression analysis in r3ko mutant
to investigate the role of sgcr <dig> gene in transcriptional regulation of c- <dig> biosynthetic gene cluster, the gene expression analysis was conducted by quantitative real time rt-pcr. the relative level of the transcripts of two other putative regulatory genes, sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig>  and two biochemically characterized structural genes, sgca <dig> and sgcc <dig>  were analysed together with sgcr <dig>  the deduced product of sgcr <dig> displays 44% end-to-end identity to strr, a well-characterized pathway-specific transcriptional activator for streptomycin biosynthesis in s. griseus  <cit> . sgcr <dig> shares high sequence identity  to arac/xyls family transcriptional regulators. sgca <dig> and sgcc <dig> were reported to catalyze the first step in the biosynthesis of the deoxy aminosugar and the β-amino acid moieties of c- <dig> chromophore respectively  <cit> . total rna from the wild type strain and r3ko mutant was extracted under which condition the wild type strain commenced c- <dig> production at about  <dig> h growth on s <dig> agar. the cdna was synthesized and then used as template in quantitative pcr. as expected, sgcr <dig> transcripts were almost undetectable in r3ko mutant while readily detectable in wild type strain. transcripts of the other four genes described above were also readily detected in wild type strain, but were significant lower in the r3ko mutant  . the results indicated that at the onset of the production of c- <dig>  sgcr <dig> directly or indirectly controlled the expression of not only the structural genes that responsible for the biosynthesis of c- <dig> chromophore but also the other two putative regulators situated in the same gene cluster.

in trans complementation of r3ko mutant with sgcr1r2
the sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig> were two adjacent genes transcribed in the same direction with a gap of only  <dig> bp, suggesting that they were transcriptionally coupled within an operon. confirmation that sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig> were controlled by sgcr <dig> came from in trans complementation of r3ko mutant with sgcr1r <dig> . the amplified dna fragment of sgcr1r <dig> associated with its native promoter was cloned into multi-copy pkc <dig> directly or under control of erme*p to give pkcr1r <dig> and pkcer1r <dig>  these two plasmids were introduced into sgcr <dig> mutant after conjugal transfer from escherichia coli. c- <dig> production was partially restored when sgcr1r <dig> was overexpressed under the control of either the native promoter  or erme*p . c- <dig> production was not detected in the r3ko mutants in which pkc <dig> and pset <dig> were introduced . the expression of sgcr1r <dig> functionally complemented the disruption of sgcr <dig>  together with results of the gene expression analysis, verified that sgcr <dig> occupied the higher level than sgcr1r <dig> did in the regulatory cascade for c- <dig> biosynthesis in s. globisporus c- <dig> 

binding of sgcr <dig> to the sgcr1r <dig> promoter region
for further investigation of the function of sgcr <dig>  its product was therefore expressed as an n-terminal his <dig> fusion protein in e. coli . subsequent sds-page analysis revealed overproduction of a clone-specific protein of the expected size of his10-sgcr <dig> . this his10-tagged sgcr <dig> protein was purified from the soluble fraction of cell lysate by nickel affinity chromatography and was estimated by sds-page to be about 90% pure .

to be a transcriptional activator of c- <dig> biosynthesis, sgcr <dig> was speculated that it may act as a positive regulator by binding at or near the promoter region of biosynthetic genes or regulatory genes and thereby activating their transcription. emsa were carried out to verify whether sgcr <dig> indeed had dna-binding activity, using the purified his10-tagged sgcr <dig> and selected dna fragments from the biosynthetic gene cluster of c- <dig>  eight intergenic regions of interest are chosen for emsa, including upstream region of sgca <dig>  sgcb <dig>  sgcc <dig>  sgcd <dig>  sgck, caga, sgcr <dig> and sgcr1r <dig> . the results showed that the recombinant sgcr <dig> protein had binding activity to the  <dig> bp upstream fragment of the sgcr1r <dig>  but not for any other of the eight dna fragments investigated. further emsa carried out using different concentration of purified recombinant sgcr <dig> showed that the shift band emerged along with the increase of the protein amount. shifting of the labelled probe was not observed when the corresponding unlabelled probes were added in excess to binding reaction . specific binding of sgcr <dig> to the upstream fragment of the sgcr1r <dig> in vitro, together with the results of gene expression analysis and sgcr1r <dig> cross-complementation in r3ko mutant, indicated that sgcr <dig> activates the transcription sgcr1r <dig> directly by binding to its promoter region.

discussion
the original sequence analysis of the c- <dig> biosynthetic gene cluster identified several orfs whose gene products may have a potential regulatory function  <cit> . we focused our initial study on the sgcr <dig> gene situated at the right end of the cluster. overexpression studies with additional copies of sgcr <dig> expressed under the control of its native promoter in wild type strain indicated a positive effect on c- <dig> production. the results obtained in the gene disruption experiment clearly demonstrated the essential positive role of sgcr <dig> in regulation of c- <dig> biosynthesis.

the results obtained in sgcr <dig> inactivation experiments were proved by complementation of the r3ko mutant using different strategies to express sgcr <dig> in trans. the results showed that expression of sgcr <dig> under the control of its native promoter either introduced by a multi-copy plasmid or integrated into the Φc <dig> attb site on the chromosome fully restored c- <dig> production. unexpectedly, the complementation of sgcr <dig> under strong constitutive promoter erme*p produced less c- <dig> than under its native promoter, suggesting that the promoter region of sgcr <dig> was intricately regulated for its timing or the amount of expression which was important for the c- <dig> production. one possibility is that there is a positive feedback mechanism controlling the expression of sgcr <dig>  e.g., sgcr <dig> and/or sgcr <dig> can activate the expression of sgcr <dig> in return.

analysis of gene expression in the mutant and wild type strain suggested that sgcr <dig> control c- <dig> production through transcriptional regulation of biosynthetic genes. it also helped to establish a hierarchy among the three regulators of the c- <dig> gene cluster. the expression level of sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig> was significantly lower in r3ko mutant than in wild type strain, implying that sgcr <dig> occupied a higher rung than sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig> did in the hierarchy of c- <dig> regulatory genes. only tylr among sgcr <dig> orthologues was characterized by gene disruption, in vivo complementation and gene expression experiments  <cit> . overexpression of tylr was experimentally proved to increase tylosin yield by 60–70%  <cit> . according to these studies, tylr occupies the lowest level in the genetic hierarchy that controls tylosin production in s. fradiae, but that was probably not the case of sgcr <dig> for c- <dig> production in s. globisporus c- <dig> 

additional evidence for a correlation between these regulators of biosynthesis was observed through the study of cross-complementation experiment. the sgcr1r <dig> functionally complemented r3ko mutant under either its native promoter or strong constitutive promoter erme*p. furthermore, the recombinant sgcr <dig> protein bound specifically to the promoter region of sgcr1r <dig>  but not that of sgcr <dig> and some structural genes detected. therefore, it was very likely that sgcr <dig> activated the transcription of sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig> by directly binding to their promoter region, to control the expression of biosynthetic structural genes indirectly. on the other hand, although the recombinant sgcr <dig> can bind to sgcr1r <dig> promoter region dna fragment without further macromolecular factor in vitro, our results do not completely rule out the possibility that other protein may be required for activating the transcription of sgcr1r <dig> 

with few except that no regulatory gene present in the biosynthetic gene cluster, e.g., erythromycin cluster of saccharopolyspora erythraea  <cit> , most much-studied antibiotic gene clusters contain at least one pathway-specific regulator. however, the biosynthesis of more complex molecules may need more regulatory gene products involving a regulatory cascade to affect a positive or negative regulation. some particularly interesting examples are the tylosin biosynthetic gene cluster of s. fradiae  <cit>  and the rapamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of s. hygroscopicus  <cit>  which contain, remarkably, no fewer than five putative regulatory genes. further analysis of other orfs in c- <dig> gene cluster revealed that additional three unknown genes might have regulatory role in c- <dig> biosynthesis. the sgce <dig> encodes a protein homologous  to a transcriptional regulator of hxlr family . the sgcr encodes a protein demonstrating some homology  to a transcriptional regulator protein  which belongs to xre  family. the deduced product of sgcm was also found to be highly similar to a putative dna-binding protein of s. coelicolor a <dig> with a helix-turn-helix motif . both sgce <dig> and sgcm have a highly homologous counterpart in ncs biosynthetic gene cluster of s. carzinostaticus. this is not surprising due to the complicated biosynthesis of enediyne chromophore, which involves multiple moieties and a convergent biosynthetic approach used to piece together the final product.

this work is the first step in deciphering the regulatory factors involved in the biosynthesis of c- <dig>  and a primary model for pathway-specific regulation of c- <dig> production is shown in fig.  <dig>  therefore, precise roles for sgcr <dig>  sgcr <dig>  sgcr <dig> and other putative regulatory genes and their complex interaction remain to be defined. the data presented in this work set the stage for subsequent studies to delineate the complexity of the regulation of c- <dig> biosynthesis, as well as for designing strategies for the construction of strains with enhanced c- <dig> production.

CONCLUSIONS
the available evidence demonstrated that sgcr <dig> was a transcriptional activator in c- <dig> biosynthesis. also, sgcr <dig> was demonstrated to occupy a higher level than sgcr <dig> and sgcr <dig> does in the regulatory cascade of c- <dig> biosynthesis in s. globisporus c- <dig> and activate the transcription of sgcr1r <dig> by directly binding to its promoter region.
