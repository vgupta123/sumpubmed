BACKGROUND
miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  are a class of non-autonomous dna transposable elements   <cit> . they were first described in the mutated maize allele wx-b <dig>  <cit>  and subsequent studies have revealed that mites are predominant in almost all plants and animals. they often have terminal inverted repeats  and target site duplications  at the ends of the elements. based on tsd sequences, earlier studies showed that mites were mainly classified into two super-families: tourist-like mites   <cit>  and stowaway-like mites   <cit> . studies have shown that mites may originate from internal deletion of corresponding autonomous transposable elements; thus, tourist and stowaway mite super-families are assumed originated from pif/harbinger and tc1/mariner elements, respectively . later studies indicated that some mites were derived from other autonomous dna transospons, such as hat transposons  <cit>  and mutator transposons  <cit> . in addition, due to ambiguous tsd and/or tir features, some mites were annotated as unknown super-families  <cit> .

there are hundreds of families of mites and they are present in high copy numbers, making them important genome constituents. these elements are widely, but not randomly, distributed in the genome, and their distribution density in each chromosome varies  <cit> . thousands of mite copies provide potential resources for genomic structure variation and may fuel genomic evolution. recent activities of mites have produced abundant mite-derived polymorphisms, which may contribute to considerable phenotypic diversity in rice  <cit> . mping, a tourist-like mite, which originated from an internal deletion of a transposase-encoding element ping, is activated by tissue culture and γ-ray irradiation in rice. mping insertions presented different profiles  among four rice strains under selection during domestication  <cit> . it was suggested that some new alleles induced by mping insertions might benefit the host by creating potentially useful allelic variants and novel, stress-inducible regulatory networks  <cit> .

although selection pressure tends to eliminate most insertions that reside in gene exons and introns in the early stage of mite amplification in the genome  <cit> , studies have still found that more ancient mite subfamilies are preferentially associated with genes  <cit> . this suggested that mites may be associated with the expression of neighboring genes. much recent research has focused on the function of mites in gene regulation. kiddo, a mite located in the rice ubiquitin <dig> promoter, has a dual function in gene regulation: its presence not only increases transcription rates but induces epigenetic modifications  <cit> . small rnas regulate the activity of transposable elements via a class of transposable element -derived 24-nt sirnas  <cit> . in solanaceae, mites generate small rnas that are mostly  <dig> nt in length and mite sirna biogenesis involves dicer-like  <dig>  rna-dependent rna polymerase  <dig>  and possibly dicer-like  <dig>  <cit> .

brassica, a close relative of arabidopsis, is an agriculturally important genus that includes a wide range of diploid and allotetraploid species, including oil crops, vegetables, and forages. b. napus, an allotetraploid species , originated from natural hybridization between the ancestral forms of the diploid species b. rapa  and b. oleracea  ~  <dig> years ago  <cit> . the brassica a and c genomes were estimated to have diverged ~  <dig>  million years ago  <cit> . the same sets of genomes in b. napus and its progenitors were defined as subgenomes of each other. the a genomes in b. rapa and b. napus were assigned the ar and an subgenomes, respectively; co and cn represent the c genome in b. oleracea and b. napus, respectively  <cit> . sequence-level comparative analysis has revealed that the similarity between the ar and an subgenomes is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, and is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % between the ar and cn subgenomes  <cit> . it has been suggested that transposable elements contribute to sequence variation in the a and c genomes  <cit> .

a stowaway-like mite, brasto, first reported in b. rapa, was found in the gene space and is still active both in diploid and allotetraploid brassica species  <cit> . in b. napus, a tourist-like mite, monkey king, was identified in the promoter region of bnflc.a <dig>  a homologue of arabidopsis flowering locus c   <cit> . in this study, we found that monkey king elements are not restricted to brassica species, but are specific to the brassicaceae family. we further investigated its sequence features, distribution, and phylogenetic relationships, and inferred its potential role in the evolution of brassicaceae genomes. monkey king-related intra- and inter-species polymorphisms were confirmed experimentally. dna methylation analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay  analysis, identification of a monkey king-related microrna , and transgenic analysis revealed its effects on gene expression and genome evolution in brassicaceae.

RESULTS
characteristics of a tourist mite family, monkey king, in brassicaceae
the monkey king sequence in the promoter of bnflc.a <dig> included  <dig> bp tirs and was flanked with a trinucleotide taa tsd, which are typical features of tourist mites . an at-rich core with a 270-bp a/t continuous fragment was found in the internal region of the sequence. a stem-loop formed in the secondary structure, with the tirs complementing each other . part of the nucleotide sequence seems to translate into amino acid residues, but no complete protein is encoded .fig.  <dig> identification and classification of monkey king.  sequence and structural characteristics of the monkey king insertion in the bnflc.a <dig> promoter. the 3-bp tsds and tirs are highlighted underlined and framed with arrows at the ends of the sequence, respectively; italics indicate a  <dig> bp a/t continuous fragment in the core region.  a stem-loop structure generated by a pair of 14-bp tir of the monkey king insertion. ten of the  <dig> nucleotides in each of the tirs are complementary to each other and the other four nucleotides have mismatches. tsds are underlined. dots represent the internal sequence in the monkey king insertion.  pictogram of tir sequences obtained from complete monkey king sequences in b. rapa, b. oleracea, a. thaliana, and a. lyrata. the height of each letter is proportional to the relative frequency of each nucleotide at that position



from the b. rapa and a. lyrata genome sequences, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> homologous sequences , respectively, were screened in the published plant mite database   <cit> . although no similar sequence was found in the mite database of a. thaliana,  <dig> monkey king homologous sequences were identified in the a. thaliana genome sequence by blast analysis . monkey king seems to be specific to the brassicaceae family, because no similar sequences were found in other plant families. monkey king density analysis of the three published genome sequences showed that the b. rapa genome, which is the largest genome in size, has the highest density , while the smallest genome  has the lowest density . in the same species, no significant differences were found in monkey king density among different chromosomes, except for chromosome  <dig> from a. thaliana and a. lyrata. in silico mapping of  <dig> complete elements on the b. rapa chromosomes also showed that they were approximately evenly distributed in their respective chromosomes . the physical positions of  <dig> complete monkey king elements from the b. rapa genome are listed in additional file  <dig>  the average length of the complete monkey king sequences varies significantly among the three genome sequences: the shortest was identified in b. rapa, followed by a. lyrata, while the longest was from a. thaliana. the average at-contents of these sequences vary slightly among the three species . however, different monkey king sequences have considerable variation in nucleotide composition in the same genome, especially in the b. rapa genome . correlation analysis between the at-content and the length of complete monkey king sequences showed that longer monkey king sequences have relatively higher at-contents in the b. rapa genome  .table  <dig> distribution of monkey king elements in b. rapa, a. lyrata and a. thaliana genome

monkey king tir consensus sequences were identified in four brassicaceae genomes: b. rapa, b. oleracea, a. thaliana and a. lyrata. for b. oleracea,  <dig> complete monkey king sequences were identified in the preliminary assembled b. oleracea genome sequence using blast analysis. the tir sequences are strongly conserved among these brassicaceae genomes . in general, one specific base occupied the highest proportion for one position. it seems that tir sequences from the two brassica genomes are more variable than those of the two arabidopsis genomes, especially at the 4th and 5th nucleotides in the 3′ terminal regions. additionally, there was a distinct difference  at the 9th nucleotide in the 3′ terminal regions between the brassica and arabidopsis genomes.

phylogenetic analysis of the monkey king elements in four brassicaceae genomes
all the complete monkey king sequences mined from the four brassicaceae genomes were used for phylogenetic analysis. in addition, the monkey king sequence in the promoter of bnflc.a <dig> from b. napus was included. from the phylogenetic tree , the monkey king members of a. thaliana and a. lyrata could be distinguished clearly from the brassica members. by contrast, the monkey king members from the two brassica genomes were interspersed with each other and could not be well separated, which indicated that they have high sequence similarity. however, some members from the same brassica genome formed a small cluster, indicating that they had been rapidly amplified in their respective genomes after a- and c- genomic species differentiation. the monkey king member in the bnflc.a <dig> promoter clustered into an a genome specific group, which indicated that the insertion may be from a genome in b. napus. in addition, different small clusters contained monkey king members from b. rapa and b. oleracea, which indicated that they might have diverged before the differentiation of the a and c genomes.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of complete monkey king sequences from brassicaceae genomes. red and black circles indicate a. thaliana and a. lyrata monkey king sequences, respectively; green and blue triangles indicate b. rapa and b. oleracea monkey king sequences, respectively; the arrow points the monkey king sequence in the bnflc.a <dig> promoter in b. napus cultivar tapidor



the preferred insertion sites of monkey king elements
the insertion sites of the  <dig> and  <dig> complete monkey king elements were inspected in the b. rapa and a. thaliana genomes using the annotated genome databases, respectively. in the b. rapa genome,  <dig>  % of the elements were inserted in gene-rich regions, less than 3kb from genes. among them, nearly half of the members were within less than 1kb from a gene, and a few members  were located within introns of genes . in the a. thaliana genome, notably,  <dig>  % of the elements were located in the gene-rich regions, while only three members  were more than 3kb from a gene. most of the members  were within less than 1kb from a gene, and two  were within introns . we also calculated the distance between the monkey king elements and untranslated regions  of genes in a. thaliana .  <dig>  % of the members  were within less than  <dig> kb from a utr. moreover, two members fell within utr regions. the details of the insertion sites of these complete monkey king elements from the two species are listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  although the monkey king copy ratios in different genomic regions showed some differences between b. rapa and a. thaliana, a similar trend was observed in the genomic locations between the two species: the closer to a gene, the higher the ratio of monkey king insertions. to further investigate the relationship between monkey king and genes, we examined potential transcriptional activity of monkey king by searching the brassica expressed sequence tag  database at ncbi. sixty-seven ests carrying monkey king fragments were mined from b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus. thirty ests matched with annotated b. rapa and  a. thaliana genes . according to the corresponding gene structure, the monkey king fragments from these ests were mainly located in 3′utr and intron regions. although more monkey king elements were inserted in the 5′ flanking sequences relative to the 3′ flanking sequences of genes, only one monkey king fragment from a est was found in a 5′utr of a gene.table  <dig> summary of the insertion positions of complete monkey king elements in the genomes of b. rapa and a. thaliana

intra- and inter-species polymorphisms caused by monkey king insertions in brassica species
to confirm if the monkey king insertions were actually species-specific or cause intra- and inter-species polymorphisms in brassica species, pcr amplification was carried out using primers designed against the monkey king flanking sequences. sequence comparisons further corroborated the pcr results . two monkey king members, sq <dig> and sq <dig>  were only detected in b. rapa and not in b. napus or b. oleracea ; the monkey king member c01- <dig> was only observed in b. oleracea and not b. napus or b. rapa . those insertions are probably species-specific and were resulted from independent activation after speciation. the monkey king member sq <dig> was detected in both b. rapa and b. napus, but not in b. oleracea , while the monkey king member c01- <dig> was detected in both b. oleracea and b. napus, but not in b. rapa . we deduced that the two members are a/c genome-specific and were inserted into the brassica genome after b. rapa and b. oleracea separated from the common ancestor and before b. napus speciation. in addition, inter-species polymorphisms caused by monkey king insertions were also observed, e.g. the member sq <dig> from b. rapa and the member c01- <dig> from b. oleracea .fig.  <dig>

monkey king dna sequence was targeted for methylation and bound by nuclear proteins
the monkey king element identified in the promoter of bnflc.a <dig> in our previous study  <cit> , was used to check the potential ability of monkey king to regulate gene expression via dna methylation and was subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay  analysis to check for interacting proteins. the methylation level of cytosine residues inside and flanking the monkey king sequences was investigated using bisulfite sequencing. in b. napus cultivar tapidor, cytosine methylation occurred in the monkey king sequence, while no apparent cytosine methylation was observed in the flanking sequences; in cultivar ningyou <dig>  no dna methylation occurred in the corresponding flanking regions . this means that dna methylation was confined strictly to the monkey king sequence.fig.  <dig> dna methylation and emsa analysis of b. napus monkey king.  and  dna methylation detection results in the monkey king sequence and its flanking sequences in the bnflc.a <dig> promoter in tapidor and ningyou <dig>  each cell represents a cytosine. blank cells denote no methylation. the higher the saturation is, the higher the dna methylation level.  emsa results in tapidor. thirteen probes  were derived from the monkey king sequence. the binding ability of the probes to nuclear proteins from tapidor leaves was analyzed by gel shift assays. plus 50-fold  and without plus unlabeled probes  were used for the binding assays



the emsa results clearly revealed that nuclear protein extracted from tapidor leaves specifically bound to a fragment  from the middle of the monkey king sequence, almost entirely composed of a/t bases . some monkey king fragments  were also recognized by nuclear proteins from tapidor leaves; however, the binding was much weaker than to the es <dig> fragment. some fragments  were non-specifically bound by nuclear proteins, because retarded bands were observed in both the noncompetitive  and competitive  binding assays. this result indicated that the monkey king insertion produced new binding motifs for some nuclear proteins , which may regulate bnflc.a <dig> expression in winter varieties of b. napus.

detection of a monkey king-related mirna
the b. napus monkey king sequence was used to scan the microrna database   <cit>  and a mirna known as bna-mir <dig> was found to perfectly match to the internal region  of the monkey king sequence . the mirna is  <dig> bp long and was firstly discovered as a new class in b. napus by zhao et al.  <cit> . further sequence analysis showed that the internal monkey king sequence  could form a stem-loop structure by itself , which suggested that bna-mir <dig> is generated from monkey king. in addition, blast analysis revealed that bna-mir <dig> aligned well to several b. napus ests . this mirna was used to search for similar mirnas in the mirbase; however, none were found in other species, which suggested that bna-mir <dig> is a brassica species-specific mirna.fig.  <dig> bna-mir <dig> generated by monkey king and its potential targets. the numbers and  arrows indicate the location of the bases in their respective sequences.  the alignment of monkey king and bna-mir <dig> .  the internal sequence of monkey king can form a bna-mir <dig> stem-loop by itself.  five ests  from b. napus matched perfectly to bna-mir <dig>  blue bases represent base mismatches



the monkey king element decreases the activity of 35s promoter in a. thaliana
to further investigate the effect of the monkey king element on gene expression, we studied the influence of the monkey king element on the activity of the 35s promoter that drives a gus reporter gene. two expression vectors, pbi <dig>  and pbi121m   were used to produce transgenic a. thaliana via agrobacterium-mediated floral dip transformation. transcription of the gus gene was assayed in transgene homozygous t3a. thaliana seedlings using quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr . seedlings hosting the pbi121m construct had lower levels of the gus transcript compared with the pbi <dig> seedlings . chemical staining also showed that the pbi121m seedlings displayed weaker gus activities than the pbi <dig> seedlings . these results demonstrated that the monkey king element decreased the activity of the 35s promoter when inserted upstream of the promoter.fig.  <dig> the effect of the monkey king element on the activity of the 35s promoter in transgenic a. thaliana.  schematic diagram of the pbi <dig> and pbi121m constructs. the monkey king sequence was inserted upstream of the 35s promoter in the pbi121m construct.  the relative transcriptional levels of the gus gene in ten-day-old transgenic a. thaliana seedlings carrying the pbi <dig> and pbi121m constructs, respectively. error bars represent the standard deviation .  chemical staining for the gus activity in ten-day-old transgenic a. thaliana seedlings



discussion
in this study, we conducted molecular and genomic characterization of a brassicaceae tourist-like mite, termed monkey king. monkey king possesses all of the typical features of tourist mites and has the consensus tir gggcctgactggtt. interestingly, a similar tir, ggggntgtttggtt, is present in kiddo and tourist-d in rice and hbr in maize  <cit> . however, no detectable similarity was observed with the internal sequences of these mites. the presence of this tir in monocot and eudicot mites suggested that these mites may have evolved from a common ancestor, or that the sequences bearing this tir easily create new mite families with dissimilar internal sequences. transposition of these mites may be mediated by the same transposase, because transposases recognize tirs to ensure mite mobility across the genome  <cit> . tirs of the same family have been used to identify members of a mite family  <cit> . tirs from one species could also be used to find novel mite families in other species, because different mite families from different species sometimes contain similar tirs, such as monkey king from the brassicaceae family and kiddo, tourist-d, and hbr from the grass family.

comparative analysis of brassica species with a. thaliana revealed that, besides genome triplication and allopolyploidization, tes contribute to the increased genome size of the brassica species  <cit> . in this study, mite density analysis showed that monkey king density in the b. rapa genome was three and  <dig> times more than that in the a. lyrata and a. thaliana genomes, respectively, demonstrating that the elements were actively amplified in the brassica after divergence from arabidopsis. on average, the b. rapa genome has the shortest complete monkey king sequence, followed by the a. lyrata genome, while the a. thaliana genome has the longest sequence. given the mite density differences among these brassicaceae genomes, we inferred that shorter monkey king sequences may be more easily amplified than longer monkey king sequences.

the high conservation of complete monkey king sequences also suggested that they have amplified relatively recently in the brassicaceae family. the high conservation of tirs was also considered a sign of recent proliferation in the maize tourist mite zmv <dig>  <cit>  and the b. rapa stowaway mite brasto  <cit> . some monkey king members have exactly the same tir sequence, which supports the recent activity and ongoing mobilization of monkey king. this hypothesis is also supported by the phylogenetic relationships among complete monkey king sequences, because some species-specific clusters were found in the phylogenetic tree. in addition, the pcr amplification results from different brassica dna samples also suggested that some monkey king insertions have arisen from independent activation in each species after speciation. in fact, our previous study suggested that the monkey king insertion in the bnflc.a <dig> promoter occurred in winter rapeseed after b. napus speciation  <cit> . these results indicated that some species-specific monkey king members inserted into their respective genomes independently after allopolyploidization ~ <dig> years ago.

monkey king is a high copy number tourist mite found in b. rapa, which parallels brami- <dig>  a recently identified high copy stowaway mite  <cit> . by contrast, in a. thaliana, we identified only  <dig> monkey king members. the physical association between mites and genes showed that, in the b. rapa and a. thaliana genomes, most complete monkey king elements were located in gene-rich regions, less than  <dig> kb from genes. many members were within less than  <dig> kb from a gene, while a few members were within introns. although the mite density and copy number showed obvious differences between b. rapa and a. thaliana genomes, a similar distribution trend was observed in the two genomes: the monkey king sequences were most abundant in the vicinity of genes. the insertion preference of this brassicaceae tourist mite is similar to that of the two brassica stowaway mites, brosto and brami- <dig>  <cit> . mites inserted in gene regulatory regions can modify gene transcriptional activity and change gene expression levels  <cit> . in a. thaliana, nearly half of the members were within less than  <dig> kb from a utr and two members fell within utr regions. additionally,  <dig> of  <dig> brassica ests carrying monkey king fragments matched the annotated b. rapa and  a. thaliana genes. thus, monkey king insertions could play a role in gene regulation and evolution in brassicaceae.

although many mites have been found in plant genomes and are associated with genes, few studies have examined the effects of mite insertions on neighboring gene expression  <cit> . in solanaceae, some mites generate small rnas, thus playing a direct role in gene regulation through the small rna silencing pathway  <cit> . in rice, sequences within mping were considered as enhancers that render adjacent genes stress inducible  <cit> . promoter activity analysis revealed that the mite kiddo was responsible for up to  <dig> % of neighboring gene expression in both transient and stably transformed rice calli  <cit> . moreover, when kiddo dna methylation was blocked with 5-azac, ubiquitin <dig> transcript accumulation increased threefold  <cit> . this indicated kiddo has a dual function in regulating gene expression. in our previous study, the monkey king insertion upstream of bnflc.a <dig> was positively associated with induced bnflc.a <dig> expression during vernalization  <cit> . in this study, monkey king dna methylation in the bnflc.a <dig> promoter was observed. this suggested that epigenetic modification may regulate bnflc.a <dig> expression by changing the monkey king dna methylation status. monkey king contains important motifs, such as tata-box and caat-box  <cit> . certain transcription factors probably bind to the motifs to change neighboring gene expression profiles. indeed, a fragment  containing putative tata-box motifs within monkey king bound nuclear protein extracted from tapidor leaves. these results suggest that monkey king insertions can produce new regulatory sites, which probably recruit new transcription factors. new alleles caused by mite insertions may benefit the host by producing useful allelic variants and novel regulatory mechanisms. in fact, bnflc.a <dig> allelic diversity caused by the monkey king insertion is one of the major causes of differentiation of winter and spring b. napus genotypes  <cit> . in addition, identification of the monkey king-related mirna, bna-mir <dig>  and its potential targets, indicated that the monkey king silencing pathway may be involved in expression regulation of genes bearing monkey king insertions. in arabidopsis, a transposable element was inserted in an intron of flc, resulting in low flc rna levels. the intronic te renders flc subject to repressive chromatin modifications mediated by te-derived sirnas  <cit> . in wheat, a mite  inserted in the promoter of vrn-a1a and influenced the flowering  <cit> . recent report showed that the mite_vrn also possessed sequences of a mirna   <cit> . whether or not bna-mir <dig> regulates bnflc.a <dig> expression through chromatin modifications of the monkey king sequence in the bnflc.a <dig> promoter remains to be investigated. bna-mir <dig> is a new class of mirna found in b. napus  <cit>  and may be specific to brassica species because it may be generated by a certain monkey king sequence. moreover, no similar mirnas from other species are present in mirbase. to date, many mites have only been identified in a given species, which suggests that mites can generate species-specific small rnas. the monkey king insertion was positively associated with bnflc.a <dig> expression  <cit> , however, our transgenic a. thaliana experiment revealed that the monkey king element inhibited promoter activity when inserted upstream region of a promoter. these results indicate that a new monkey king insertion may enhance or repress the expression of a gene with which it is associated, by causing dna epigenetic modification, nuclear protein binding sites and possible mirna-mediated regulation. given the wide distribution of monkey king elements in some brassicaceae genomes, this tourist mite family may contribute considerable phenotypic diversity to brassicaceae plants.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we characterized a brassicaceae tourist-like mite family monkey king. comparative analysis of brassica species with arabidopsis species revealed its putative role in the evolution of brassicaceae genomes. phylogenetic analysis and investigation of intra- and inter-species polymorphisms supported recent proliferation of monkey king in brassica species. monkey king elements are closely associated with genes and influence gene regulation and evolution. dna methylation detection, emsa analysis, identification of a monkey king-related mirna, and transgenic experiments suggested that monkey king insertions could regulate gene expression and genome evolution in the brassicaceae family in a variety of ways, such as epigenetic modification and new regulatory motif production.
