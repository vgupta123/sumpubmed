BACKGROUND
lipoprotein lipase  is produced by parenchymal cells in some tissues , secreted, and transported to the luminal side of capillaries. here the enzyme hydrolyzes triglycerides in chylomicrons and vldl and thereby makes fatty acids available for tissue metabolism. lpl activity is rapidly modulated by the nutritional state and plays a major role in distribution of fatty acids between tissues  <cit>  .

the rapid daily modulations of lpl activity are mainly post-transcriptional  <cit> . one mechanism involves changes in the proportion of active to inactive species of the enzyme without significant changes in total lpl protein  <cit> . down-regulation of adipose tissue lpl activity upon fasting requires that a gene, other than the lpl gene, is switched on  <cit> . this implies a protein that can transform lpl from an active to an inactive form. the fasting-induced, ppar-responsive angiopoietin-like protein- <dig>  has emerged as a strong candidate for the role of such an lpl-controlling protein in adipose tissue  <cit> . in vitro studies show that angptl <dig> interacts with lpl and converts active lpl dimers to inactive monomers  <cit> . inactivation of angptl <dig> in mice is associated with low plasma triglycerides and high post-heparin lpl activity  <cit> . a special case is that angptl4−/− mice on a diet with high content of saturated fat develop severe abdominal inflammation due to excessive lpl-mediated lipid uptake in mesenteric lymph nodes  <cit> . similarly, a loss of function mutation in angptl <dig> in humans is associated with low levels of plasma triglycerides  <cit> . conversely, overexpression of angptl <dig> in mice results in low lpl activity and high plasma triglycerides  <cit> . taken together these data convincingly show that angptl <dig> is involved in modulating the activity of lpl and thereby metabolism of plasma triglycerides. it should be noted however that angptl <dig> also has effects on angiogenesis and several other processes, and that there are additional members in the angptl protein family that have effects on plasma lipid metabolism  <cit>  .

another protein important for lpl action is the newly discovered glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein  <dig>  gpihbp <dig>  <cit> . this protein, which is expressed only in endothelial cells, is crucial for transfer of lpl to the luminal side of the capillary endothelium  <cit> . inactivation of the gene for gpihbp <dig> in mice results in gross chylomicronemia. genetic deficiency in humans produces a clinical phenotype similar to that in lpl deficiency. it is not known if gpihbp <dig> has any direct role in the modulation of lpl action. like angptl <dig> <cit>  the gpihbp <dig> is ppar-responsive  <cit> , suggesting that the two genes might be similarly regulated.

a third, newly discovered, protein involved with the lipase system is the lipase maturation factor . this is an er-based chaperone which appears to be necessary for maturation of lpl and the related hepatic lipase and endothelial lipase into their active forms  <cit> .

in this paper we have explored how this landscape of lpl controlling proteins behaves in rat adipose tissue under a number of conditions previously shown to be associated with rapid changes of lpl activity. specifically we have studied  if angptl <dig> is needed for the rapid modulation of lpl activity;  if the message levels show circadian oscillations,  at what rates the messages for the three lpl-controlling proteins and the proteins themselves are being turned over,  how the messages for the lpl controlling proteins change on changes in the nutritional state, known to cause large changes of adipose tissue lpl activity and  what happens to the expression of the three proteins when rats become insulin resistant.

RESULTS
circadian rhythm
the expressions in adipose tissue of many of the genes involved in energy metabolism undergo circadian changes  <cit> . we followed the changes with time of day of a number of parameters related to lpl activity . rats eat mainly during the dark period . mean food consumption was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of body weight per hour during the night . during the first hours of the light period  the rats ate  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of body weight per hour. this is less than 5% of what they ate per hour during the night. from 9:00 h −15:00 h food consumption per hour was about one quarter of that during the dark period. during the last hours of the light period, 15:00 h – 18:00 h, food consumption increased to about half of that during the dark period.


the changes in plasma glucose and non-esterified fatty acids  over the day were moderate . adipose tissue lpl mrna  showed its highest value at 22:00 h. this was  <dig>  fold higher than the lowest value . changes in gpihbp <dig> mrna  were modest and the tendency was opposite to that for lpl mrna, with higher values during the light than during the dark period. the increase in angptl <dig> mrna during the light period was more pronounced compared to gpihbp <dig>  but the levels were down again by  <dig>  h. lpl activity  in adipose tissue showed its highest value at 2:00 h and its lowest value at 10:00 h . the difference was about two-fold. lpl mass  followed a similar pattern, and the ratio between lpl activity and mass  did not change significantly.

response of the proteins studied and of lpl activity when mrna or protein synthesis was blocked
to directly study the turnover of the proteins involved, cycloheximide was injected in rats to block synthesis of new proteins . lpl activity decreased by 60% in 3 hours . lpl mass, measured by elisa , and estimated from western blots , decreased at a similar rate as the activity. these data are in line with earlier observations that the lpl protein turns over rapidly  <cit> . in contrast, angptl <dig> protein showed bands of similar intensity on western blots throughout the four hours studied . the pattern was the same when antibodies to the c-terminal  or n-terminal domain  of angptl <dig> were used. almost all of the protein was full length . with antibodies to the c-terminal domain small amounts of a 45 kda fragment was seen , probably representing the fibrinogen-like domain of angptl <dig>  these data show that the angptl <dig> protein turns over relatively slowly, much slower than the lpl protein. the turnover of the gpihbp <dig> and lmf <dig> proteins could not be studied since suitable antibodies were not available.


to directly study the turnover of the corresponding messages, the transcription blocker actinomycin d  was injected . fasted rats were used since the level of angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> messages in adipose tissue are several-fold higher in the fasted than in the fed state  <cit> . in concert with earlier studies  <cit> , lpl activity in adipose tissue rose from  <dig> ±  <dig> to  <dig> ± 112 mu/g in six hours after actd . the value for lpl mrna decreased by 8% by 4 h and by 33% by 6 h , but these changes did not reach statistical significance. lpl mass as measured by the elisa increased by 40%  in 6 h. consistent with these data, western blots showed that the level of lpl protein was essentially stable over the six h studied . these data confirm that the lpl transcript is relatively stable.

while lpl activity went up, mrna levels for angptl <dig>  gpihbp <dig> and lmf <dig> were reduced by 93%, 75% and 29% by six hours after actd . these results show that the angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> transcripts are turned over rapidly. on western blots, the angptl <dig> protein showed bands of similar intensity throughout the six hours . this pattern was the same when antibodies to the c-terminal or n-terminal domain were used. almost all of the protein was full length but traces of a 45 kda fragment were seen with the antibody specific for the c-terminal domain of angptl <dig>  these data again show that the angptl <dig> protein turns over relatively slowly.

early response to food withdrawal
to study the early events in adaptation of the lpl system in adipose tissue to fasting, food was withdrawn from rats in the morning. at this time the animals ate rather little . their stomachs were about half full and emptied almost completely within two hours after food was removed. insulin  and glucose  decreased whereas nefa increased . triglycerides decreased, presumably because the inflow of chylomicrons from the intestine faded . lpl mrna in adipose tissue did not change significantly, in accordance with earlier observations  <cit>  . the level of mrna for lmf <dig> also did not change significantly . in contrast, the levels of angptl <dig> mrna and gpihbp <dig> mrna increased markedly  in adipose tissue over the six hours studied . lpl activity in adipose tissue had decreased by 40% at four hours and by 53% at six hours . in contrast there was no significant change of lpl mass . all of these responses to food withdrawal were similar in a parallel experiment on female rats, but data are shown only for males. these data indicate that short term fasting is associated with reciprocal changes in adipose angptl <dig> mrna and lpl activity.


relation to changes in expression of other genes
to get a perspective on the rapid and large response of angptl <dig> transcript on fasting  <cit>  we carried out an array analysis of the changes of rna abundances in adipose tissue under the conditions used for our experiments. for this, food was removed from one group of rats in the early morning. seven h later the rats were sacrificed, epididymal adipose tissue was cut out, rna prepared and analyzed on illumina arrays. n =  <dig> for both the fasted and the ad lib group. after filtering the data for p <  <dig>  and signal intensity >  <dig>  there remained  <dig> transcripts that had increased, and  <dig> that had decreased by a factor of  <dig>  or more.

sorting by foldchange+, angptl <dig> came out as number four from the top , preceded only by pdk <dig>  pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase  <dig>  a key regulator of glycolysis/glyceroneogenesis, gpr109a, the ketone body/niacin receptor, a key regulator of lipolysis, and rgd1565690_predicted, a gene of unknown function . in concert with the results of the experiment in figure  <dig> and earlier observations  <cit> , the expression of lpl did not change significantly . neither gpihbp <dig> or lmff <dig> was represented on this chip.


food was removed from one group of rats in the early morning. seven h later the rats were sacrificed, epididymal adipose tissue was cut out, rna prepared and analyzed on illumina arrays. n =  <dig> for both the fasted and the ad lib group. full data are deposited at ncbi geo, accession no gse  <dig> 

responses to re-feeding
to study a situation when adipose tissue lpl activity increases rapidly we turned to re-feeding as a physiological model that we had used before  <cit> . for this, rats were fasted overnight and food was given back in the morning. the animals started to eat within  <dig> to 10 min. by one hour their stomachs contained  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/100 g body weight , similar to what was found in the stomach of regularly fed rats . insulin  followed a time course similar to that for weight of stomach contents. glucose increased , and nefa decreased . angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> mrna levels decreased rapidly and after two hours were only  <dig> and 21% of the initial levels, respectively . lpl activity and mass increased . thus, similar to fasting, fasting-refeeding is associated with reciprocal changes in adipose angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> mrna on the one hand, and lpl activity on the other hand.


response of the lpl system to fasting and re-feeding in angptl <dig> −/− mice
to directly investigate the role of angptl <dig> in the rapid modulation of lpl activity we turned to studies in mice in which angptl <dig> had been inactivated  <cit> . groups of mice  were fed ad lib, fasted over night, or fasted over night and then re-fed in the morning for 3 h. plasma lipid levels were in accordance with previous results on angptl4−/− mice  <cit> . separation of lipoprotein classes by fplc high-lighted that the fasted angptl4−/− mice had no tg in the vldl fraction, while after re-feeding the levels of vldl tg were similar in angpt4−/− compared to wild-type mice . the peak of hdl cholesterol was slightly higher in angptl4−/− and was shifted towards larger particles in all three groups of mice compared to wild-type . the increase in nefa on fasting was blunted in the angptl4−/− mice . this is in accordance with a role of angptl <dig> for intracellular lipolysis  <cit> .


in the wild-type animals, fasting caused a decrease of adipose tissue lpl activity, as expected . in contrast, fasting caused an increase of adipose tissue lpl activity in the angptl4−/− mice compared to fed or re-fed angptl4−/− animals. lpl activity was significantly higher in all three nutritional states in angptl4−/− compared to wild-type animals, indicating that angptl <dig> represses lpl activity to some extent also in fed animals. angptl <dig> mrna was about two-fold increased in fasted compared to ad lib fed wild-type mice, while, as expected, there was no detectable angptl <dig> mrna in the angptl4−/− mice . gpihbp <dig> mrna was also increased about two-fold in fasted wild-type mice compared to the fed groups. interestingly, this difference was not seen in the angptl4−/− mice . lpl mrna was not significantly changed in wild-type mice, but was decreased in the fasted angptl4−/− mice compared to the fed groups . taken together these data demonstrate that the reduction in adipose lpl activity upon fasting is dependent on increased expression of angptl <dig> 


response to insulin
to study direct effects of insulin on the lpl system, fasted rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of insulin,  <dig> u/kg body weight, which is in the range used for insulin tolerance tests in rodents  <cit> . the injection resulted in levels of insulin in blood that were about five times higher than the mean level in controls at 60 min. glucose and nefa both decreased . already one hour after the injection, adipose tissue lpl activity had almost doubled . lpl mass did not change significantly . angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> mrna both decreased . one hour after injection of insulin the levels were 33% and 50% of the initial levels, respectively.


changes with age and/or weight of the rats
previous studies have shown that the response of adipose tissue lpl activity to feeding/fasting is blunted in old, obese rats  <cit> . to probe this we studied rats at three different ages, 5 weeks old, lean, body weight  <dig> ± 20 g; 25 weeks old, moderately obese, body weight  <dig> ± 66 g; and 52 weeks old, grossly obese, body weight  <dig> ± 82 g. one set of rats from each age group was fasted overnight and compared to ad lib fed controls.

in the fasted state, the young lean rats had low blood glucose, about  <dig>  mmol/l. the intermediate and old rats had much higher blood glucose, about  <dig>  mmol/l . in the fed state the three groups had similar blood glucose levels, around 8 mmol/l. the fed/fasted ratio for glucose was around  <dig>  in the young, lean rats, but only  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the old and intermediate groups, respectively. nefa levels were similar in all three groups in the fed state . on fasting, the level increased almost three-fold in the young rats, but did not change significantly in the intermediate or old rats. plasma insulin levels  showed large differences between the groups. the fasting level was below  <dig>  ng/ml in the young rats, four times higher in the intermediate group and  <dig> times higher in the oldest group. the fed/fasted ratio was about  <dig> in the young lean rats, but only  <dig>  in the intermediate group. in the old group insulin levels in plasma did not differ between fed or fasted animals.


in accordance with the observations for food withdrawal  and re-feeding , angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> mrna levels were much higher in the fasted than in the fed state in the young rats . in contrast there were no statistically significant changes with nutritional state in the older rats.

adipose tissue lpl activity, expressed per gram wet tissue weight, was high in the young rats, about 1600 mu/g. in the intermediate and old rats the activity was less than one-third . these rats had much larger fat pads than the young lean ones so that the total lpl activity per pad was actually larger in the older groups , compared to the young rats. remarkably, the response to nutritional state was more pronounced in the young rats with a fed/fasted ratio more than twice as high as that in the two older groups .

discussion
the present study reinforces previous observations that rapid modulation of lpl activity  is not exerted at the level of lpl gene expression  <cit> . lpl mrna levels remained essentially stable under the conditions we tested. likewise, the mrna for lmf <dig>  an er protein needed for proper maturation of lpl into its active form  <cit> , did not change significantly, in accordance with an earlier study in zucker diabetic rats  <cit> . in contrast, the mrnas for angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig>  changed much more rapidly than most mrnas in mammalian cells  <cit> . these two proteins interact with lpl and we will designate them collectively as ‘lpl controlling proteins’. there may well be more, yet undiscovered, proteins that participate in the lpl system. a major mechanism for the modulation of adipose lpl activity is conversion of catalytically active lpl dimers into inactive monomers  <cit> . this process is virtually irreversible  <cit> . the lpl protein, active or inactive, turns over with a half-life of less than two hours  <cit>  which is much more rapid than the turnover of most proteins in mammalian cells  <cit> . hence, the overall design of the lpl system appears to be relatively constant production and secretion of short-lived enzyme molecules that either retain or loose their catalytic activity in response to a number of controlling proteins. this design may have evolved to meet the need to modulate the activity of secreted/extracellular lpl molecules.

the expression of many genes involved in energy metabolism undergo profound circadian oscillations in the adipose tissue presumably to adapt the animal to predictable changes in the environment  <cit> , lpl mrna, mass and activity all shoved higher values in the middle of the dark period. for lpl activity the amplitude was about two-fold, in accordance with previous studies  <cit> . angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> mrna showed modest changes opposite in direction to that for lpl. hence, it appears that the lpl system displays a moderate circadian oscillation in phase with the eating behavior, but can respond rapidly and profoundly whenever food becomes scarce. of note, the circadian oscillations of adipose tissue lpl are more pronounced in mice, with a more than three-fold higher activity in the middle of the dark period compared to the middle of the light period  <cit> . a significant circadian variation has also been reported for post-heparin lpl activity in humans  <cit> .

a possible confounding factor for studies of how lpl activity is modulated in adipose tissue is changes in the rate at which proteins are being synthesized in the adipocytes  <cit> . parkin et al. found that insulin more than doubled the rate of incorporation of amino acids into proteins in rat fat pads and caused a corresponding increase in lpl activity  <cit> . other groups have reported similar observations  <cit> . kern and his associates have described a more specific mechanism that affects lpl synthesis whereby stimulation of the protein kinase a system leads to formation of a protein complex that binds to the 3’utr of lpl mrna and blocks its translation  <cit> . it seems likely that part of the early responses of lpl activity in our studies, e.g. after injection of a large dose of insulin, reflect decreased/increased rates of lpl translation. this can not, however, fully explain the changes seen. for instance, during food deprivation  lpl activity decreased by more than 50%, while there was no significant change in lpl mass.

the experiment on angptl4−/− mice clearly demonstrated the important role of angptl <dig> for suppression of adipose tissue lpl activity in the fasted state. even though lpl mrna levels were significantly reduced in adipose tissue of the angptl4−/− mice, compared to all other groups of mice, lpl activity was the highest in adipose tissue of fasted angptl4−/− mice. also in the ad lib fed and the re-fed states, adipose tissue lpl activity was significantly higher in angptl4−/− mice than in wild-type mice, indicating that some lpl is depressed by angptl <dig> even under conditions when lpl activity is at demand. these data are compatible with those of köster et al.  <cit> , demonstrating 2– <dig> fold higher lpl activity in post-heparin plasma in angptl4−/− mice compared to wild-type mice in both fed and fasted animals. similarly, blocking transcription by actd led to a decrease in angptl <dig> mrna levels in adipose tissue and to a 3-fold increase in lpl activity in fasted rats  <cit> , and to a 3-fold increase in post-heparin plasma lpl activity in ad lib fed rats  <cit> . in fed animals, most of the lpl activity in post-heparin plasma originates from adipose tissue, while in fasted animals the dominating source is presumably skeletal muscle and heart  <cit> . taken together the data demonstrate that angptl <dig> is an important modulator of lpl activity in both fasted and fed animals.

the present data show that angptl <dig> mrna turns over rapidly in adipose tissue, in concert with an earlier study  <cit> . when transcription was blocked by injection of actd, the mrna decreased more than 90% in 4 hours. the mrna level responded rapidly to the perturbations of the nutritional state that we used. it increased more than 200% from  <dig> to 6 hours after food deprivation. it decreased by about 50% in one hour after injection of insulin and by about 65% within two hours after re-feeding of rats that had fasted overnight. in all of these situations, the expression of angptl <dig> changed as expected for a gene that negatively controls lpl activity. whenever the expression of angptl <dig> increased, lpl activity decreased and conversely when the expression of angptl <dig> decreased, lpl activity increased. the time courses for the changes were compatible with a major role for angptl <dig> in modulation of lpl activity, if one takes into account that the general rate of protein synthesis, and hence lpl synthesis, probably changed . in contrast to the rapid changes of angptl <dig> message levels, the angptl <dig> protein remained essentially unchanged over several hours, as evaluated by western blots. this was true whether we used antibodies to the n-terminal or c-terminal domains, and was true both in experiments where syntheses of new protein was blocked by cycloheximide and in experiments where message levels changed several-fold in response to a transcription block or in response to food withdrawal, re-feeding or insulin injection. this suggests compartmentalization, such that only newly synthesized angptl <dig> protein can inactivate lpl. within cells the angptl <dig> protein exists as monomers but they form oligomers when they reach the cell surface  <cit> . it is only after oligomerization that the angptl <dig> protein can interact with and inactivate lpl  <cit> . hence, it is possible that lpl and angptl <dig> monomers do not interact when they travel through the secretory pathway, but there is a critical event when the proteins emerge at the cell surface that triggers oligomerization of angptl <dig> and thereby inactivation of lpl. lmf <dig> may have a role here  <cit> . once lpl transfers to the endothelial cells the enzyme may be rescued by interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans  <cit>  and/or gpihbp <dig>  <cit> .

the message for gpihbp <dig> also turned over rapidly. when transcription was blocked by actd the message decreased by more than 60% within 4 hours. it increased 4-fold from  <dig> to 6 hours after food deprivation. it decreased by about 50% in one hour after injection of insulin and by about 80% within 2 hours after re-feeding of overnight fasted rats. this is in accordance with the studies of davis et al. who found that gpihbp <dig> message in adipose tissue is higher in 16 h fasted than in fed rats  <cit> . comparing the amplitudes of the changes, gpihbp <dig> was at least as responsive as angptl <dig>  this is impressive considering that array analysis showed that angptl <dig> was one of the genes whose expression had increased most seven hours after food withdrawal . the changes of gpihbp <dig> mrna were in the same direction as the changes of angptl <dig> mrna in all the situations that we studied. this is surprising. according to present hypotheses angptl <dig> protein suppresses lpl activity. gpihbp <dig> on the other hand stabilizes the enzyme and promotes its delivery to the site of action at the vascular endothelium  <cit> . one should note that the changes presumably take place in different cells in the tissue. gpihbp <dig> is expressed in endothelial cells  <cit>  whereas angptl <dig> is presumably expressed mainly in adipocytes. it is possible that gpihbp <dig> not only delivers lpl to the luminal side of the endothelium, but that under certain circumstances, like during fasting, gpihbp <dig> may predominantly transport lpl in the opposite direction leading to lpl-inactivation and or degradation within the tissue  <cit> .

rapid, tissue-specific modulation of lpl activity is important for whole body energy homeostasis by directing lipid uptake to the appropriate tissues and limiting the need for re-transport  <cit> . earlier studies have shown that the response of adipose tissue lpl activity to feeding-fasting becomes blunted as rats grow older and become obese  <cit> . the present study confirms these observations and links them to the development of insulin resistance. in young, lean rats  adipose tissue lpl activity decreased by a factor of  <dig>  –  <dig>  on fasting overnight. in older, obese rats the response was less than half,  <dig>  –  <dig> -fold. the older rats appeared to be insulin-resistant. fasting blood glucose and insulin was elevated compared to the young rats and the difference fed versus fasted was less for all parameters studied. it is of interest to note that these rats were not manipulated in any way but housed by normal routines and fed chow ad lib <cit> . the responses of the lpl controlling genes, angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> were blunted. the large change in gpihbp <dig> mrna  seen when young rats were fasted was completely abolished in the older rats. for angptl <dig> mrna some response remained but it was much less than in the young rats. it is of interest to note that the values seen in either the fed or fasted state in the older rats were similar to those seen in fasted young rats. hence, it appears that it was the ability to down-regulate the expression in the fed state that caused the loss of metabolic plasticity. in line with this it was recently shown that mrna of angptl <dig> is upregulated in diabetic mice  <cit>  whereas insulin inhibited angptl <dig> mrna expression in 3 t3-l <dig> adipocytes  <cit> . moreover, ffa, which are increased in the insulin-resistant state, were shown to upregulate mrna expression of angptl <dig> in human adipocytes  <cit> . a study on groups of human subjects  demonstrated a blunting of the response of angptl <dig> to feeding/fasting in both groups of elderly individuals compared to the young, while no effect was in this case seen on gpihbp <dig> expression  <cit> . bergö et al. found that blocking transcription by actd  increased adipose tissue lpl activity several-fold in fasted young rats, but had only a small effect in old, obese rats  <cit> . these data are compatible with the hypothesis that expressions of angptl <dig> and/or gpihbp <dig> are main determinants for lpl activity in adipose tissue of rats.

modulation of lpl activity is important for partitioning of lipids between tissues in accordance with changes in the metabolic situation  <cit> . it is becoming evident that that modulation of lpl action occurs by interplay of several factors. the central player, the lpl enzyme, appears to be produced at a relatively constant rate. the activity and the distribution of the enzyme between the endothelial cell surface and other places in the tissue are determined by lmf <dig>  angptll <dig> and gpihbp <dig> and perhaps other proteins in a context dependent manner. in addition lpl action is modulated by factors pertaining to the lipoprotein substrate  <cit> . apolipoprotein cii is a necessary cofactor. apolipoprotein ciii and other apolipoproteins can suppress lipase action. in this case the action of the enzyme is inhibited but not irreversibly lost.

CONCLUSIONS
the main conclusion from this study is that angptl <dig> is necessary for the rapid modulation of lpl activity in adipose tissue. angptl <dig> message levels responded very rapidly to changes in the nutritional state. lpl activity always changed in the opposite direction. this did not happen in angptl4−/− mice. gpihbp <dig> message levels also changed rapidly and in the same direction as angptl <dig>  i.e. increased on fasting when lpl activity decreased. this was unexpected because gpihbp <dig> is known to stabilize lpl.

in old, obese rats that showed signs of insulin resistance, the responses of angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> mrna and of lpl activity were severely blunted  or almost abolished . hence, the plasticity of the lpl system is severely blunted or completely lost in insulin resistant rats.
