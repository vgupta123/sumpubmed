BACKGROUND
mammary tumors are the most common form of canine tumors and account for approximately 50% of all tumors in female dogs  <cit> . development of canine mammary tumors  is influenced by age, hormone and genetic predispositions. cmts are commonly seen in bitches at middle and old age, with a median age of 8– <dig> years  <cit> . purebreed dogs have higher incidence of cmt  <cit>  and breeds like poodles, english springer spaniels , german shepherds, boxers, and dachshunds have a higher risk of developing cmt  <cit> . overall, human and dog cancer diseases show similarities in terms of the role of steroidal hormones during tumor development, and correlation between tumor grade and rate of metastasis  <cit> . a recent study has shown that variations in the brca <dig> and brca <dig> genes are associated with cmt in esss  <cit>  and these genes are responsible for early onset of breast cancer in women. inherited mutations in brca <dig> or brca <dig> increase the risk of breast cancer in women by around 56–84%  <cit> . the clinical impact and outcome of having brca mutations is somewhat unclear in humans  <cit> . brca1-associated breast cancers often occur in younger women, and these tumors are high grade and lack estrogen receptors , and are often triple-negative and, as such, harder to treat  <cit> . in dogs, overexpression of brca <dig> and brca <dig> has been found in mammary adenocarcinomas and their lymph node metastases, hence implying a tendency to reflect grade of malignancy  <cit> . nevertheless, comparative breast cancer studies are likely to greatly benefit both human and veterinary medicine.

early detection of cmts and efficient therapy can increase the life span in dogs  <cit> . several tumor markers, such as carbohydrate antigen 15– <dig> , thymidine kinase  <dig> , carcinoembryonic antigen , estrogen receptor , and human epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig> , have been evaluated for their capacity to aid in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of breast cancer in humans  <cit> . some of these markers, like ca 15– <dig>  cea, er, and her– <dig>  have been clinically evaluated in dogs  <cit> , but investigations on tk <dig> in cmts are largely lacking.

thymidine kinase  is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of deoxythymidine  to deoxythymidine monophosphate , which is subsequently phosphorylated to di- and triphosphates via the salvage pathway  <cit> . thymidine kinase  <dig> is cell cycle-dependent and s phase-specific. the tk <dig> activity reaches a peak g1/s boundary and then decreases rapidly in g <dig> and becomes undetectable in m phase  <cit> . in human medicine, serum tk <dig>  activity level serves as biomarker for prognosis and monitoring treatment of lymphoma and leukemia  <cit> . serum tk <dig> activity has been determined by using the commercially available tk-radioenzyme assay   <cit>  and non-radiometric tk-liaison assay  <cit> . these activity-based assays provide valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment monitoring in canine lymphoma and leukemia  <cit> . a recent study on sera from dogs with solid tumors demonstrated that determination of stk <dig> protein levels with immunochemical methods gave higher sensitivity compared to tk <dig> activity measurements  <cit> .

to date, no studies exist where both tk <dig> activity and tk <dig> protein levels have been determined in sera from cmt patients. in this study, we analyzed tk <dig> activity and tk <dig> subunit 26 kda protein levels in sera from  <dig> dogs with cmts. we further characterized the molecular forms of tk <dig> in all, cmt, and healthy dog sera using size exclusion chromatography. in the case of all, it was possible to study the cellular form of tk <dig> isolated from the leukemic cells, as in the cmt tissue extract. to our knowledge, this is the first time that cellular and serum forms of tk <dig> from the same patient have been determined.

methods
serum samples
sera from healthy dogs and dogs with mammary tumors were collected from the university animal hospital at the swedish university of agricultural sciences, uppsala, sweden, and stored at −20°c until analysis. the project was approved by the swedish animal ethics committee and owner consent was collected for each patient. the study comprised samples from healthy dogs  and dogs with mammary tumors  n = 3). the mean and median age was 6 years  for the healthy group, and  <dig>  and 9 years  for dogs with mammary tumors.

the tumor diagnostic procedures were as described previously  <cit> . a total of  <dig> breeds were included in this study. the most common breeds included were labrador retriever, rottweiler, boxer, and german shepherd , followed by golden retriever and riesenschnauzer  rhodesian ridgebacks and mixed breed , bernese mountain dog and ess , field spaniel, flatcoated retriever, border collie, american cocker spaniel, welsh springer spaniel, belgian shepherd, dalmatian, dachshund, and greyhound . polyclonal antibodies were produced against different epitopes in the c-terminal region of dog tk <dig>  the 28-mer antibody was produced using a  <dig> amino acid synthetic peptide  as antigen . the 16-mer antibody was produced against a  <dig> amino acid c-terminal region    <cit> .

isolation of acute lymphocytic leukemia cells and preparation of cell extract
an amount of 4 ml of heparinized all patient blood was diluted with an equal part of sterile phosphate-buffered saline  and the diluted blood sample was mixed with an equal volume of ficoll-paque. this was followed by centrifugation for 30 minutes at  <dig>  revolutions per minute . the cell band was removed, and washed three times with rpmi  <dig> medium with l-glutamine containing 20% fetal calf serum  and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. the cell preparation contained at least 95% all cells with a viability of >98%. cell viability was estimated by using the trypan blue exclusion assay. if the cells take up trypan blue it indicates that the cells are non-viable. cell viability should be at least >95% for healthy log-phase cells in cultures. percentages of viable cells were determined by using the following formula: %viablecells= <dig> –numberofbluecells÷numberoftotalcells× <dig>  

cells  were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm tris/hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  mm nacl, 7 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ,  <dig> % np- <dig>  and 2 mm 4-2benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride  for 30 minutes at 4°c. the suspension was centrifuged at  <dig>  rpms for 10 minutes at 4°c and supernatant was stored in aliquots at −80°c after addition of 20% of glycerol. protein concentration in the supernatant  was determined using the bio-rad assay.

extraction of thymidine kinase  <dig> from canine mammary tumor tissue
three grams of fresh tumor tissue  were collected from the clinic in sterile pbs, ph  <dig> . the accuracy of the tumor diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological analysis of two flanking tissue preparations right adjacent to the tissue used for tk <dig> analysis. the tk <dig> enzyme extract was prepared as follows: the tissue was homogenized in a teflon homogenizer with two volumes of  <dig>  m tris-hci buffer, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig>  m sucrose, 25 mm kci, 5 mm mgci <dig>  7 mm edta,  <dig> % np- <dig>  and 2 mm 4-2benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride . the homogenate was centrifuged at  <dig>  rpms for 30 minutes. the supernatant with a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml was stored at −20°c for further analysis.

serum thymidine kinase activity assay
thymidine kinase  <dig> activity in serum samples was determined using an optimized -dthd phosphorylation assay, as described previously  <cit> . in brief, this assay is based on a radio enzymatic technique in which the substrate 3-thymidine is converted to 3-thymidine monophosphate by tk <dig> in serum. the tk <dig> activity is expressed as pmol of dtmp formed per minute per ml of serum.

immunoaffinity sepharose preparation
the purified polyclonal anti-dog tk <dig> antibody  was coupled to cyanogen bromide -activated sepharose 4b, as described previously  <cit> . briefly, 2 mg of purified 16-mer antibody was added per 1 g of the cnbr-activated sepharose 4b resin in  <dig>  m sodium bicarbonate  on agitation for 4 hours at room temperature. then the coupled sepharose was transferred into tris–hcl buffer  after 2 hours at room temperature. the resin was washed alternately three times with acetate buffer  and tris–hcl buffer . the coupled antibody-sepharose was mixed with tris-buffered saline  containing  <dig> % nan <dig> 1: <dig>  and stored at 4°c.

size exclusion chromatography
size exclusion chromatography was performed as described elsewhere  <cit>  using a superose  <dig> column  attached to fast protein liquid chromatography  equipment . acute lymphocytic leukemia cell extract, all sera , cmt tissue extract, cmt sera , and sera from a healthy dog   were diluted in hydroxyethyl-piperazineethane-sulfonic acid , ph  <dig> , buffer   and applied on the column. standard proteins were α2-macroglobulin, 720 kda; β-amylase, 200 kda; bovine serum albumin , 66 kda; ova albumin, 45 kda; and horse myosin, 17 kda.

thymidine kinase  <dig>  isolation by anti-tk <dig> antibody sepharose
dog recombinant tk <dig> , 60 μl, serum samples were diluted with tbs, ph  <dig> , to a final volume of 230 μl. next, 300 μl of fplc fractions were incubated with anti-dog tk <dig> antibody sepharose . the samples were agitated at 4°c for 4 hours, followed by centrifugation for 1 minute at  <dig>  rpms. the antibody sepharose was washed twice with tbs, once with tbs-tween, and once more with tbs. then, 30 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  sample buffer  sds, 10%; bromophenol blue,  <dig> %; and dithiothreitol , 10 mm) was added to the sepharose before incubation at room temperature for 20 minutes, followed by centrifugation as above. the supernatants were heated at 95°c for 5 minutes and subjected to 12% sds-page, followed by electrophoretic transfer and western blotting, as described previously  <cit> .

statistical analysis
the tk <dig> activity and protein distribution in both groups were tested for normality using the d’ agostino and pearson omnibus normality test. the majority of distributions were gaussian and we used one way analysis of variance  followed by tukey’s multiple comparison post test to compare tk <dig> values across multiple groups. pearson correlation coefficient  was used to determine the correlation between tk <dig> activities and tk <dig> protein levels. unpaired t-test was used to evaluate the difference between the groups. for sensitivity and specificity analysis and for comparison of assays, receiver operating characteristic  curves were constructed. statistical analyses were performed using graph pad prism  <dig>  . the level of significance was set at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
serum thymidine kinase  <dig> activity and protein levels in canine mammary tumor
sera from  <dig> healthy dogs and  <dig> cmt dogs were analyzed for stk <dig> activity and stk <dig> protein, as described in the materials and methods section. the intensities of the 28 kda recombinant dog tk <dig> polypeptide  were analyzed and a standard curve was created, as shown in figure  <dig>  serum tk <dig> protein levels in clinical samples were calculated using this curve. in the healthy group, stk <dig> activity was in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  pmol/min/ml, with a mean ± standard deviation  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . in the immunoaffinity/western blot analysis, faint bands were detected in sera from healthy dogs, with a range of 3–18 ng/ml . in the cmt group, the stk <dig> activity was  <dig> – <dig>  pmol/min/ml . high stk <dig> protein levels were found in the mammary tumor sera  and the stk <dig> protein concentration ranged from 9 ng/ml to 54 ng/ml . serum tk <dig> protein levels in the all serum , all extract , and cmt extract  were also determined.figure  <dig>

significant differences were found in mean stk <dig> activity  and stk <dig> protein levels  between healthy and cmt dogs. significant correlations were also found between the stk <dig> activity and stk <dig> protein levels in healthy dogs  and cmts . canine mammary tumors were further classified as benign or malignant and the stk <dig> protein and activity levels were determined in these subgroups and compared to those in healthy dogs. there was no significant difference in stk <dig> activity in sera from healthy, benign, and malignant dogs . however, a significant difference was found in stk <dig> protein levels between these subgroups . to evaluate the performance of the two different assays, roc curve analysis for cmts vs. healthy dogs was done. the results showed that tk <dig> activity assay had an area under the curve  of  <dig> , p =  <dig>    <dig> – <dig> ), with a cutoff value of  <dig>  pmol/min/ml, sensitivity of  <dig> , and specificity of  <dig>  . the tk <dig> protein assay, however, had an auc of  <dig> , p <  <dig>  . the sensitivity in this case was  <dig>  and the specificity  <dig> , using a cutoff value of  <dig>  ng/ml . the specific activity of stk <dig> , based on the immunoaffinity assay and 3-dthd activity measurements in healthy dogs, was 49 ± 21 nmol/min/mg, which is significantly higher  compared to sera from the cmt group . the higher stk <dig> specific activity in healthy dogs , compared to dogs with cmts, means that there is a larger fraction of inactive tk <dig> polypeptide in case of cmts.figure  <dig>

molecular forms of thymidine kinase  <dig> in acute lymphocytic leukemia extract and sera
a fresh blood sample collected from a dog with all and white blood cells were separated, as described in the materials and methods section. cellular extract and sera from the same dog were applied to the superose  <dig> column and the tk <dig> activity and protein levels in the fractions were determined. native cellular tk <dig> activity eluted as major peak with molecular weights  of 40–66 kda, but with a small peak and some enzyme activity in the fractions at the higher mw range . western blot analysis of cellular extract fractions showed a tk <dig> subunit  in the fractions eluted, corresponding to mws of 40–66 kda, with faint bands in the high mw region . when analyzing sera from the same dog, about 90% of tk <dig> eluted as a peak in the high mw range corresponding to 200–720 kda . a tk <dig> polypeptide of 26 kda was detected in fractions 1– <dig>  but the band intensity did not correlate with the activity levels in these fractions . these results indicate that active cellular tk <dig> isolated from all exists mainly as dimer, while active stk <dig> from the same dog was found to occur as a high mw oligomer. a gel filtration experiment has been carried out with sera from another all dog and similar results were found .figure  <dig>

molecular forms of thymidine kinase  <dig> in mammary tumor extract and sera
tissue extract prepared from a cmt patient  was applied on the superose  <dig> column and around 70% of total tk <dig> activity eluted as major peak with mws of 40–100 kda, but with a minor peak and some enzyme activity in the fractions corresponding to higher mw . western blot analysis of cmt extract showed a tk <dig> subunit  in the fractions corresponding to the peak and faint bands in the high mw region . a serum sample from the same cmt dog was also analyzed and more than 95% of the total tk <dig> activity eluted in fractions 1– <dig>  corresponding to the mw range 200–720 kda . thymidine kinase  <dig> polypeptide of 26 kda was detected in all fractions  and there was no correlation with tk <dig> activity. these results indicate that stk <dig> protein exists in multimeric forms in cmt , many of them apparently inactive.figure  <dig>

molecular forms of thymidine kinase  <dig> in healthy dog sera
a serum sample from a healthy dog  was subjected to size exclusion chromatography. thymidine kinase  <dig> activity was recovered as a single peak in fractions 1– <dig>  corresponding to a mw range of 500–720 kda . western blot analysis showed a tk <dig> polypeptide of 26 kda in the same fractions . these results demonstrate that stk <dig> exists as an active high mw oligomer in sera of healthy dogs. when we analyzed another healthy dog serum on superose  <dig> column, similar results were found .figure  <dig>

discussion
serum tk <dig> determinations have been used clinically for many years as they provide valuable information to guide anti-cancer therapy both in human and in veterinary medicine. development of antibody-based assays has extended the use of tk <dig> in human breast cancer. some studies in humans have shown that breast cancer sera contain high stk <dig> protein levels, which can serve as prognostic marker for early stage detection  <cit> . a recent study in dogs with solid tumors has shown that tk <dig> protein assays are more sensitive compared to tk <dig> activity assays  <cit> . mammary tumors occur more frequently in dogs than in other species and diagnosing patients during early stages of disease will be valuable clinically. in this study, we evaluated if stk <dig> activity assay and tk <dig> protein assay can effectively differentiate cmt patients from healthy dogs.

the reason for comparing all and cmt was to show the difference in the molecular forms of tk <dig> in hematological tumors  and solid tumors . in our last published study  <cit>  we demonstrated the molecular forms of stk <dig> in an all patient and it was hence highly interesting to repeat these studies together with a characterization of the molecular forms of cellular  tk <dig> from the same all patient. furthermore, cmt are the most common tumors in older dogs and to develop an assay that can aid in the diagnosis of these types of tumors would be highly clinically valuable.

even though stk <dig> activity levels in cmts significantly differ from levels in healthy dogs, there is a large overlap between levels in the two groups. the results presented here using stk <dig> protein assays showed a larger difference and cmt patients had significantly higher stk <dig> protein levels compared to healthy dogs. in this study, stk <dig> protein assays were apparently able to differentiate benign from healthy samples as well as benign from the malignant forms of cmt, indicating that it may be possible to predict tumor progression by measuring stk <dig> protein levels. furthermore, the roc curve analysis showed that the stk <dig> protein assay had a sensitivity of  <dig> , while the stk <dig> activity assay showed a sensitivity of  <dig> . consequently, the stk <dig> protein assay is most likely very valuable for establishing prognosis and early diagnosis in cmts. recently, expression analyses in cmts have shown significant similarities to human breast cancer  <cit> . consequently, it is suggested that these profiles can aid in prognosticating outcome  <cit> . however, these expression analyses are still complicated and most likely useful only as research tools. moreover, they require specific, non-routine tissue preparation. a simple protein measurement in serum from a mammary tumor patient would be significantly easier to use and have a direct clinical implication. a natural next step in this research is to investigate if tk protein levels are correlated to, e.g., brca status in canine mammary tumors  <cit>  and, if so, if tk protein level analysis is a suitable complement to more elaborate expression analyses of extirpated tumor tissue and is possible to perform before surgery. this could become a marker to gate patients into more, or less, aggressive surgical/medical interventions and could likely positively affect outcomes. it could also reduce surgical trauma in a fair portion of cases, which is ethically attractive. in the present study no correlation was tested between e.g. high/low grade in the cmt group because of low power. it is known that half of the malignant cmt  metastasize. thus, it would be clinically highly beneficial if an early indication of the metastatic potential of the individual tumor could be made. the present study clearly indicates the need for prospective follow-up studies, where larger groups of cmts are collected, with possibility to collect follow-up information on clinical outcome and compare histopathological grade and pre/post-op stk <dig> protein values to see if a decline in stk <dig> levels is seen post-op, further indicating the correlation between stk <dig> levels and cmt.

however, a lack of more detailed information about the molecular forms of stk <dig> in dogs with tumor disease is a problem when it comes to using tk <dig> as a biomarker. in this study, we characterized cellular and serum forms of tk <dig>  the cellular tk <dig> in all cells was found to exist mainly as active dimers, as reported previously  <cit> , while stk <dig> occurs as high mw oligomeric complexes. there was no direct correlation between stk <dig> protein and activity levels, as shown previously  <cit> , and this was apparently due to the different types of tk <dig> protein complexes, with varying specific activity. active tk <dig> in cmt cell extracts was mainly found as tetramers, while stk <dig> activity occurred predominantly as high mw oligomers. the 26 kda tk <dig> protein levels were correlated to the activity in cell extract, but in case of stk <dig>  the 26 kda polypeptide was detected in all fractions corresponding to a broad range of mws. in stk <dig> in healthy dogs, where the levels were low, both tk <dig> activity and protein were detected only in the high mw region. there is a correlation between stk <dig> activity and protein levels in sera from healthy dogs  and sera from dogs with cmts . this is most likely because activity assays measure the high mw complex of tk <dig>  whereas the tk <dig> protein assays measure both active high mw and inactive lower mw forms. there was a difference in the mean specific activities of stk <dig> from healthy dogs, dogs with cmt, and the dog with all, namely, 49 ±  <dig>  20 ±  <dig>  and 760 ± 40 nmol/min/mg, respectively. the results obtained in this study are similar to those described earlier  <cit> . the specific activity of stk <dig> was measured in a relatively large group of dogs with cmt and was found to be about half that of stk <dig> in healthy dogs and about 2% of that observed in the all dog, which is very close to results observed with recombinant canine tk <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, we have attempted to determine total tumor tk <dig> protein and activity levels as well as stk <dig> levels in all and cmt dogs, using the same methods. there was a large difference in the ratio between the cellular and stk <dig> total activity and 26 kda tk <dig> protein levels in the all and cmt dogs . the reason for these large differences is most likely related to the differences in specific activities of the cellular and serum form of tk <dig> and this in turn is linked to the mechanisms involved in the accumulation and release of tk <dig> from hematologic and solid tumors. however, further studies are needed to clarify this question.

normally, tk <dig> is present in relatively low concentrations in blood from healthy dogs. it is 5–20-fold in malignant diseases  <cit> . therefore, sensitive laboratory methods are needed to obtain sufficient specificity and sensitivity. with the current available enzyme activity assays, this was achieved only for hematological tumors. these enzyme activity assays were not sufficient for detecting mammary tumors in dogs. however, stk <dig> protein assays differentiate cmts from healthy dogs more effectively and improve the clinical precision. the work described here will help to develop a reliable tk <dig> clinical test, which could be valuable in veterinary medicine. furthermore, with the similarities to human mammary tumors, it will likely have comparative implications in breast cancer research.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from this study show that tk <dig> protein assays provide more clinically relevant information on cmts compared to tk <dig> activity assays. size exclusion chromatography analysis demonstrates that stk <dig> exists as a high mw complex form in dogs with all, healthy dogs, and dogs with cmt, with active enzyme. in addition, in sera from dogs with cmt, there is a large fraction of inactive tk <dig> in intermediate and low mw complexes. these results will help to develop better tk <dig> protein assays of value for human and veterinary medicine.
