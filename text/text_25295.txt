BACKGROUND
islets are small organ-like structures, which are rich in vasculature and are predominantly constituted of insulin-secreting β-cells and glucagon-producing α-cells. as the main target of autoimmunity that results in type  <dig> diabetes, β-cells have been the subject of numerous studies aiming to identify the mechanisms which cause the massive cell death that ultimately leads to overt disease. in the setting of autoimmunity, β-cells respond to the onslaught of proinflammatory cytokines produced by immune cells, such as interleukin -1β, tumor necrosis factor  -α and interferon- γ, which trigger the nf-κb pathway and promote transcription of genes that ultimately cause β-cell dysfunction and cell death  <cit> .

a promising treatment for type  <dig> diabetes is islet cell transplantation  <cit> . to this end, pancreata from brain-dead non-diabetic donors are selected and islets are harvested and purified in clean room facilities for infusion into the portal vein of diabetic patients. however, the isolation procedure employed to obtain purified islets is time-consuming and frequently fails to produce sufficient good quality islets to enable a successful engraftment. the low yield during the isolation procedure can be credited, at least in part, to previously identified factors present in the organ donors, such as: advanced age, cause of brain death, episodes of anoxia, hypertension, use of vasopressors, which cause ischemia, poor glycemic control, and extended periods in the intensive care unit  <cit> . in addition, studies in an experimental model showed that brain death triggers an early increase in serum proinflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> and that their transcription, together with that of the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein- <dig> , are increased in the pancreas  <cit> .

inherent difficulties in separating islets from the surrounding acinar tissue may also contribute to a lower islet recovery  <cit> , and a common feature resulting from the isolation procedure will be a certain amount of cell death and loss of insulin content; both being hallmarks of low-quality harvested islets.

in the past two decades, toll-like receptors  have been progressively acknowledged as crucial pathogen recognition receptors, playing major roles in innate responses, as well as in triggering adaptive immunity  <cit> . the manifold properties of tlrs have been mainly identified in immune cells, especially macrophages and dendritic cells  <cit> . the most extensively studied receptor is tlr <dig>  which is the receptor for gram-negative bacterial endotoxins, collectively known as lps. control of tlr <dig> activation involves glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored cd <dig>  md- <dig>  and the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein . lbp binds to the lipid a moiety of lps and transfers lps to cd <dig>  which guarantees and optimizes signaling through the tlr <dig> complex  <cit> .

besides being found in antigen-presenting cells, several tlrs, and more specifically, tlr <dig>  have been identified in other cell types, such as endothelial cells  <cit> , myocytes  <cit> , thyroid cells  <cit> , endometrial cells  <cit> , mesangial cells  <cit> , and adipocytes  <cit> . in each of these cases, tlrs participate in responses associated to stress and disease. tlr <dig> has also been identified in human β-cells and β-cell lines such as hp <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig>  using immunofluorescence-based methods, whole islets and the sv40-transformed hp <dig> β-cell line were shown to express tlr <dig> and cd <dig>  however, the expression was not restricted to β-cells, since glucagon-secreting α-cells and even ductal cells were also positive.

in the present study, we investigated whether "ex-vivo" expression of tlr <dig> occurs in β-cells from islets harvested from brain dead donors, and the effects of tlr <dig> activation on insulin production and secretion, and on cell viability.

RESULTS
islets harvested from brain dead donors display variable expression levels of tlr4
analysis of gene expression at the mrna level, by quantitative rt-pcr, in freshly isolated human islets or in non- adherent islet cultures, confirmed the presence of tlr <dig> transcripts. in  <dig> out of  <dig> islet cell preparations, from different pancreata, analyzed immediately after the isolation procedure, variable levels of tlr <dig> gene expression were observed, which persisted for up to 48h in culture. no association was observed between tlr <dig> expression levels and glucose-induced insulin secretion in purified islets, cold ischemia time  or other donor variables, such as donor age, days in the intensive care unit or the presence of infection . however, when the relative mrna expression was measured at  <dig>   <dig>  and 48h, the pearson coefficient test  revealed a positive correlation between tlr <dig> and well known pro-inflammatory molecules involved in β-cell death, namely caspase- <dig>  mcp- <dig>  il- <dig> receptor antagonist, and fas  gene expression levels. this correlation was particularly evident in pancreatic islets obtained after low yield islet isolation procedures, in which islets displayed low cell viability, as measured by the live/dead fluorescence method, even though the relative mrna levels differed in islets from one pancreas to another .

 each ieq  represents one islet  <dig> μm in diameter,  purity is defined by percentage of dithizone-positive cells  in the islet preparations,  viability as measured by live/dead fluorescence,  relative tlr <dig> mrna expression levels are variable and this column indicates only presence  or absence  of detectable levels of tlr <dig> mrna at any time point,  correlation was obtained from time-course analysis of mrna expression of tlr <dig> and β-cell death-associated molecules by the pearson coefficient test. the presence  or absence  corresponding to a significant positive or negative linear correlation  is indicated in this column.

tlr <dig> expression observed on the surface of human pancreatic islets is mainly restricted to β-cells
we then investigated whether the tlr <dig> gene expression observed was restricted to functional endocrine islets cells or due to infiltrating macrophages and dendritic cells present within the islets.

to confirm which cell types were expressing the functional tlr <dig> protein, triple staining with newport green , which is specific for zn-rich insulin granules  <cit>  anti-tlr4-apc, and anti-cd11b-pe antibodies, was performed for flow cytometric analysis in isolated cells obtained after treatment with accutase. as observed with mrna transcripts, islets showed variable levels of tlr <dig> expression on the cell surface  , which was almost exclusively present in insulin-producing β-cells  . the percentage of cd11b+ cells was very low, but consistently tlr <dig> positive  . the fact that macrophages are present in a very low number is not surprising, considering that these islets were obtained from non-diabetic donors and non-infected pancreata, therefore, one would not expect to find infiltrating leukocytes.

lps-induced tlr <dig> expression in cultured β-cells leads to loss of cell viability
to investigate whether tlr <dig> activation affects viability of the pancreatic β-cells, the response of adherent cell cultures to lps was tested. following a 48h exposure to different concentrations of lps , the islet cells showed a markedly enhanced mrna expression of both tlr <dig> and the lps-associated cd <dig> molecules, in a concentration-dependent manner . after 48h the cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry with anti-tlr4/ng/tmre triple staining. a significant reduction of cell viability was observed , reaching  <dig>  ± 5%  at 48h , revealing the involvement of the activated tlr <dig> signaling pathway in the mechanism of β-cell death.

tlr <dig> expression is accompanied by decreased insulin synthesis and secretion
since a recently reported study indirectly associated tlr <dig> to glucose-mediated insulin regulation in human peripheral blood monocytes  <cit> , we hypothesized that this receptor could also be operating a negative regulatory mechanism in pancreatic β-cell insulin production and secretion.

as measured by ng-positive staining , the relative proportion of insulin content in lps-treated cells was reduced by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , when compared with non-treated cells . under the same conditions, we observed a discrete, but significant, decrease of insulin mrna expression . in agreement with these data, a  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  decrease in insulin secretion was observed in β-cells treated with lps .

the effects of lps-induced tlr <dig> expression in mouse min- <dig> cells closely resemble those observed in cultured human islets
in order to confirm the effects of tlr <dig> activation in β-cells, we assessed lps-induced stimulation of tlr <dig> expression in min- <dig> mouse insulinoma cells. under the same conditions used for human islet adherent cell cultures, we observed a  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold increase in both tlr <dig> and cd <dig> mrna levels, respectively , which were accompanied by a  <dig>  ± 3% loss in cell viability  in response to lps  in min- <dig> cells . lps was also capable of inducing a strong reduction of insulin content , as measured by ng-positive staining . taken together, these data suggest that the mechanisms for cell death and regulation of insulin homeostasis can be modulated by tlr <dig> in human and murine lps-stimulated β-cells.

discussion
in accordance with a growing literature showing that toll-like receptors exhibit functions in the homeostasis of several types of non-immune cells  <cit> , here we show that β-cells harvested from human non-diabetic brain-dead organ donors also express variable levels of tlr <dig>  our results indicate that there could be a role for tlr <dig> in β-cell homeostasis, possibly related to cell viability or insulin production.

in contrast with a previous study  <cit> , we showed that lps not only increases tlr <dig> expression and diminishes cell viability, but, also, leads to loss of β-cell insulin content. in both non-diabetic human and murine β-cells, tlr <dig> as well as cd <dig> transcripts were identified, with lps  leading to a concentration-dependent increase in their gene expression levels, in parallel with lowered cell viability and decreased insulin content and mrna transcription. these results are in agreement with a study showing that blocking tlr <dig> expression in murine islets by carbon monoxide treatment leads to increased survival of islet implants in an allogenic murine model  <cit> 

in a recent study  <cit>  with the brin bd <dig> rat clonal cell line, the authors showed decreased insulin secretion upon culturing in the presence of lps, but no change in insulin content. the authors also observed a reversal of the effect on insulin secretion upon removal of lps. the observed lack of change in insulin content may be explained by the fact that cells were incubated with  <dig> ng/ml lps only for 24h, in contrast to our incubation period for up to 48h, but using half the dose of lps. indeed, in our study, we also observed a low effect upon insulin content when cells were incubated for 24h . taken together, these findings suggest that effects on β-cell insulin content and cell viability require more time to take place.

in addition to the classical activation, via pathogen-associated molecular patterns, tlr expression in monocytes has been shown to be regulated by glucose  <cit> . high glucose levels induced tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> expression while mannitol did not, excluding an osmotic effect as the cause for observed results. increased tlr <dig> expression occurred due to pkc-δ-mediated activation and stimulated p47phox-dependent nadph oxidase activity, establishing a link between high glucose, nf-κb-mediated inflammatory cytokine production, and tlr expression. in another study, with type  <dig> diabetic patients, in which tlr expression in mononuclear cells was monitored in response to low-dose insulin infusion, a further relationship between tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  and insulin homeostasis was identified  <cit> . steady-state infusion during a short 4h period caused an increase of approximately  <dig>  fold in insulin plasma levels while maintaining the patient's glycemia, and led to decreased tlr expression, which occurred independently of blood glucose levels. the effect of this short-term experiment, however, was more pronounced on tlr <dig> than on tlr <dig> expression. it is possible that increasing the period of infusion would have increased the effect on tlr <dig> expression.

our study suggests a further link between insulin homeostasis, cell viability, and tlr <dig> expression. although we did not measure apoptosis-related molecules, we used tmre as an indirect marker for apoptosis. tmre is a dye with a high degree of membrane permeability that accumulates in viable mitochondria, thereby marking only cells that are not undergoing apoptosis. in the presence of lps-induced tlr <dig> expression, in both human and murine β-cells, insulin mrna, insulin secretion and insulin content were diminished, and β-cell viability was decreased .

endogenous ligands for tlr <dig> have been described, most of which have been proven to exert their effect independently of an eventual experimental lps contamination  <cit> . the list includes heat shock proteins  <dig> and gp <dig>  <cit> , fibronectin type iii extra domain a  <cit> , hyaluronan  <cit> , saturated fatty acids  <cit> , advanced glycation end-products  <cit>  and heme  <cit> . in other words, molecules produced or circulating during abnormal situations such as tissue damage and ischemia are capable of triggering tlr4- dependent pathways. these conditions are commonly present in brain-dead organ donors, being potential causes of engraftment failure as well as setting the conditions for inappropriate expression of tlr <dig> on non-immune cells. it remains to be seen how many of these potentially damaging factors are present before and during the long-lasting islet isolation procedures, and which, by favoring tlr <dig> expression, may further contribute to diminished insulin content and lower islet yield.

we can also envisage that increased glucose plasma levels not only induce insulin secretion, triggering insulin gene transcription and replacement of the intracellular stocks, but also increase surface expression of tlr <dig> molecules. the release of endogenous tlr <dig> ligands during tissue damage and inflammation followed by docking onto β-cells, could then result in loss of the ability of these β-cells to respond normally to glucose, contributing to the extra load of circulating plasma glucose and worsening of the glycemia control observed in response to tnf-α and adrenalin, as well as other hormones secreted under stressful situations.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, in the present study, we not only confirm the expression of tlr <dig> in pancreatic β-cells, but also suggest that its expression impacts upon β-cell viability and insulin synthesis and secretion, indicating that tlr <dig> should be included in the list of molecules affecting control of insulin homeostasis in β-cells.
