BACKGROUND
chicken is a model organism in various fields of biology, such as embryology or immunology. it is also the only bird species for which the genome has been studied in detail and a lot is expected from its use in comparative genome analyses. this will help to detect sequences conserved between species, which should correspond to unknown exons and to regulatory or other functional regions. such analyses will therefore be essential for the annotation of other genomes, including that of human  <cit> . chicken is also actually the only major agricultural species for which a draft assembly of the genome sequence is available  <cit> . thanks to a significantly lower rate of interspersed repetitive elements and to the use of a highly inbred bird for sequencing, this draft is probably more accurate than the first one published for human three years ago  <cit> . nevertheless, previous comparisons of rh mapping data with the sequence data showed that some sequence segments are in wrong positions of the genome assembly  <cit> . therefore the integration of all available chicken mapping resources will be essential for improving the quality of the assembly, building a more reliable and informative resource. in addition to the genetic and bac contig maps that have already been used, the rh map will thus provide an independent source of data to assist the chicken genome sequence assembly process towards a finished quality sequence.

rh panels are available for several domestic animals: cow  <cit> , pig  <cit> , horse  <cit> , dog  <cit>  and cat  <cit> . the successful production of a rh panel in chicken is quite recent  <cit>  and therefore only a limited number of chicken chromosomes have been studied to date, namely: gga <dig>  <cit> , gga <dig>  <cit> , gga <dig>  <cit> , gga <dig>  <cit> , and gga <dig>  <cit> .

we present here the radiation hybrid map of chicken chromosome  <dig>  built by using markers chosen from the gga <dig> genetic map and a substantial number of additional markers developed from chicken est data. markers from the genetic map are essential to anchor the rh map onto gga <dig>  markers developed from est data were chosen on the basis of existing comparative mapping information data, indicating conservation of synteny with hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig>  hsa <dig> and hsa <dig>  they were used primarily to saturate the map in markers and also to increase the precision of comparative maps. the gga <dig> rh map obtained was aligned with the genomic sequence assembly to detect eventual discordances.

RESULTS
development of est markers
eighty eight microsatellite markers and  <dig> genes were selected from available data in the literature or the databases. in addition to this,  <dig> markers were developed from est data to saturate the map. at the time this study was initiated, comparative mapping data suggested conservation of synteny of gga <dig> with  <dig> human chromosomes and therefore genes were selected from regions of hsa <dig> , hsa <dig> , hsa <dig> , hsa <dig> , hsa <dig> , hsa <dig> , hsa <dig> , hsa <dig> , hsa <dig> . primers were developed using the iccare web server  <cit>  with the constraints specific to rh mapping. one hundred and seventy eight out of  <dig> markers  amplified successfully. this high success in primer design using est is comparable to what was achieved in other studies using the iccare web server  <cit> .

gga <dig> rh map 
altogether, genotyping data were obtained for a total of  <dig> markers. two-point analysis with carthagene using a lod threshold of  <dig> enabled the construction of  <dig> gga <dig> linkage groups containing a total of  <dig> markers, including all the microsatellite and gene markers from the genetic map. out of the remaining markers, two  should have been integrated into the gga <dig> rh map, given their location within the sequence assembly. one explanation, concerning the lack of these  <dig> markers, could be that the retention frequency, that is unusually low for these two markers and indicative of pcr problems, did not allow attaining a lod score value significant for linkage. the other  <dig> markers map either to other chromosomes or to unknown regions. they correspond to the external boundaries of the regions of conserved synteny with human, from which est were chosen for marker development.

the final rh map of chicken chromosome  <dig> is  <dig> cr <dig> long and comprises  <dig> markers. a one-to-one comparison with the genetic map shows a good overall agreement, with a few improvements over the genetic map; for example markers adl <dig> and mcw <dig> are mapped with a higher precision than previously on the gga <dig> linkage group. at the end of the chromosome , the  <dig> markers  were in the same order in the linkage group, but its orientation is different from the genetic map. these markers are mapped on the comprehensive rh map , so the orientation given in the genetic map may be the right one.

the corresponding comprehensive map comprises a total of  <dig> markers .

comparative maps 
as a result of our map construction strategy, based in great part on the development of est markers, we found a few observations worthy of comment.

based on the information that the microsatellite mcw <dig>  identified as being in the limk <dig> gene, mapped to the gga <dig> genetic linkage group <cit> ,  <dig> chicken est markers were developed, corresponding to  <dig> mb of hsa22q <dig>  containing the homologous gene. recently, jennen et al indicated that the mapping of limk <dig> was erroneous and that it was located on the gga <dig> rh map  <cit> . we confirm here this result, as all of our five markers mapped to the gga <dig> rh linkage group . the mcw <dig> marker remains on the gga <dig> rh map, at the position corresponding to where the former limk <dig> would have been expected. the result of the blast search of mcw <dig> in the genome assembly indicated a homology with a sequence fragment of unknown location. no similarity with a limk sequence could be found in this fragment.

a recently published paper describing the mapping of il1b on gga <dig> suggested a conservation of synteny with hsa2q  <cit> . the il1b primers we tested failed to amplify correctly, but other chicken est markers located near il1b, whose position is  <dig>  mb on hsa2q, had been used in another mapping project in our laboratory  <cit> . of these, actr, positioned at  <dig>  mb and bin <dig> at  <dig>  mb on hsa <dig>  were mapped to gga <dig>  if il1b, located between these two markers in human, is indeed on gga <dig>  the fragment of conserved synteny must be very small. the sequence of il1b in the chicken genome assembly is in a fraction of unknown location.

previous data suggested that the ryr <dig> gene, mapped on hsa <dig>  was located on gga <dig>  <cit> . we have therefore tested  <dig> chicken est markers orthologous to hsa <dig> genes, but only one  could be localized on the gga <dig> rh map. as this localisation could be questioned, the identity of the fragment was confirmed after sequencing of the pcr product.

as already observed for other chicken chromosomes  <cit> , the gga <dig> regions investigated here, corresponding to regions of human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed a high number of intra-chromosomal rearrangements within the regions of conserved synteny.

alignment of the rh map to the genomic sequence 
a first draft chicken genome assembly was recently deposited into public databases by a team led by r. wilson and w. warren, from the washington university school of medicine in st. louis . the sequence coverage is  <dig> x. for gga <dig>   <dig> . <dig> bp were sequenced,  <dig> known genes were identified, and a total of  <dig> genes were defined altogether when including results from prediction programs.

for each gene or microsatellite marker from our gga <dig> rh map, we compared the fragment sequence with the chicken genome sequence assembly by using the blast algorithm  <cit> . the position for each marker in the sequence is indicated in figure  <dig>  the agreement between the rh map and the sequence order is almost perfect, with only a few local inversions that can be put on the account of genotyping errors or other artefacts that may remain despite all precautions taken, such as the double genotyping process.

in the upper part of the chromosome, several markers absent in the sequence assembly could be localized on the rh map: sequences corresponding to centg <dig> and cspg <dig> genes are aligned with "unknown" sequence  and abr <dig> is found on the gga <dig> sequence. the rh two point lod scores between centg <dig>  cspg <dig>  abr <dig> and their neighbours on gga <dig>  are higher than  <dig>  in addition, the genetic map confirms the localization of abr <dig> on chicken chromosome  <dig>  in the same region of the rh map, mcw <dig>  belongs to a genomic region with no sequence available ; the genetic map confirms the rh position of this marker. these results suggest possible improvements to be made in the sequence assembly for this region of chromosome  <dig> 

on the sequence assembly, the tsg gene, at position  <dig>  mb, is close to eya <dig> and stau <dig>  whereas on the rh map tsg maps at  <dig> cr, close to ptpn <dig> and lei <dig>  located at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb respectively. at the same position as tsg on the rh map, the vapa gene corresponds to a sequence fragment of unknown location. moreover, the rh map in this region is in agreement with comparative mapping, so we suspect there may be problems in the sequence assembly in the tsg region.

around position  <dig> cr, two local inversions between the rh map and the sequence orders are observed. the first concerns prkdc and mapre <dig>  and the second sdcbp and adl <dig>  in both cases, est markers mapped close to these genes are missing in the gga <dig> sequence assembly: cebpd near prkdc and asph near sdcbp are in the fraction of unassigned sequence. however, in the case of the prkdc-mapre <dig> region, the sequence assembly is in agreement with the gene order on human chromosome  <dig>  the order of the markers in the rh map is supported in both cases by a difference of lod greater than  <dig>  when compared to the alternate order.

in the lower part of the chromosome, several markers localized on the rh map are absent from the gga <dig> sequence assembly: the hey gene at position  <dig> cr is localized on gga <dig> in the assembly, whereas the two-point lod scores with its neighbours on the gga <dig> rh map are trust-worthy . the matn <dig> and ncald genes are in the unknown fraction of genomic sequence, whereas the 2-point lod scores with their neighbours, around  <dig> cr, are higher than  <dig>  at the end of the chromosome , we observed an inversion between the rh map and the sequence concerning the nov gene and the microsatellite lei <dig>  the order in the rh map is supported by a difference of lod greater than  <dig> when compared to the order in the sequence assembly.

altogether, out of  <dig> markers localized on gga <dig> through rh mapping, only one, labelled "no hit" in figure  <dig>  could not be found by blast in the chicken genome sequence;  <dig> were assigned to existing genomic sequence of unknown location;  <dig> were assigned to a wrong chromosome and  <dig> were not localized at the same position when both maps were compared. with less than 10% of markers either missing in the sequence or for which the two maps disagree, these results confirm the high quality of the genome assembly, with only few finishing improvements to be made in the near future.

the gga <dig> rh map is available on the chickrh web server  also used for rh genotyping data collection.

CONCLUSIONS
we have built a high resolution radiation hybrid map of chicken chromosome  <dig> using the chickrh <dig> panel. our goal was to provide jointly a source of potential polymorphic markers and of candidate genes for qtl mapping on this chromosome. in the course of our work, the first draft chicken genome assembly was released and we aligned it to our gga <dig> rh map. although the sequence assembly is globally in good agreement with our data, a limited number of discrepancies and the mapping of sequence fragments of unknown location or of markers not present in the genomic sequence, show that rh mapping it still useful.

future developments of the chicken rh map will now be based on the genomic sequence, using it for choosing sts markers in selected regions to develop rh framework maps and thereby detect eventual problems in the genomic sequence assembly. this is clearly needed in the regions for which the genetic map is still not complete, such as some microchromosomes, but also for parts of macrochromosomes, as shown in this study.
