BACKGROUND
sines  are powerful tools for systematic and population biologists  <cit> . examples of phylogenies elucidated using the sine method include the use of sines to support the hypothesis that cetaceans  form a clade within artiodactyla  <cit> , clarification of relationships between cichlid fishes  <cit>  and the resolution of the human-chimpanzee-gorilla trichotomy  <cit> . although applications of sine elements to resolve population dynamics have been limited to humans  <cit>  and, to a lesser extent, cichlid fishes  <cit> , these studies have been very successful in revealing patterns of variation and there is every reason to believe that they can be as productively applied to other species.

one reason for the success of sines as phylogenetic and population genetic markers is that their mode of evolution is unidirectional  <cit> . this characteristic allows for a confident inference that the ancestral state is the absence of the sine at each locus. because there is no known mechanism for the specific removal of sines from any genome  <cit> , individual sines are generally thought to be homoplasy-free characters  <cit> .

alu elements are primate-specific sines of ~ <dig> bp. these elements have been extremely successful at propagating in primate genomes as evidenced by the fact that they make up ~10% of the human genome by mass  <cit> . distinct subfamilies of alu elements in the human genome have been described in detail  <cit> . examination of these young subfamilies has provided us with clues as to the mobilization dynamics and evolution of alu elements in the hominid lineage. characterization of alu mobilization in non-human primates has not been as complete. the ascertainment of lineage-specific subfamilies of alu elements would increase our understanding of mobile element evolution in these organisms and allow for the development of sine-based studies of population and evolutionary patterns.

we recently used alu insertion loci to clarify various relationships among platyrrhine  and cercopithecid  primates  <cit> . these projects produced examples of alu insertions present in a wide variety of lineages along the primate tree. we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of the alu sequences themselves  in order to characterize the evolutionary history of alu lineages that have been or currently are retrotransposition competent in some non-human primates.

RESULTS
platyrrhine-specific alu sequences were obtained from the data sets used in ray et al.  <cit>  when available, the sequences from multiple taxa at a particular locus were aligned and a consensus sequence generated to create an approximation of the sequence of the original insertion. a total of  <dig> platyrrhine-specific insertions were collected. all selected sequences were examined for the presence of target site duplications . the presence of these tsds along with the absence of each marker in hominid and cercopithecid taxa  serves to verify that the elements are the result of retrotransposition events and not segmental duplications. to trim potentially long branches and to verify the ability of the approach to recover previously established relationships among reference sequences, we added the consensus sequences for alu elements specific to hominids   <cit> . we also included the canonical alu consensus sequences for the jb, sc, sg, sp, sq, sx, and y subfamilies  <cit>  and rooted the tree on alujb based on previously established relationships  <cit> .

the methods used to identify informative loci among cercopithecid taxa primarily involved a linker-pcr strategy using two alu selection primers  <cit> . unfortunately, this introduced a sequence bias toward particular subfamilies of recently integrated or lineage specific alu elements. the strategy used to identify informative platyrrhine loci, on the other hand, used a combined computational-experimental approach. over half of the loci identified were derived from bacterial artificial chromosome  sequences and thus no bias was introduced. in addition, a wide variety of primers was used in the linker-pcr approach; as a consequence, the bias was reduced for experimentally-derived loci. because of the bias in the data derived from the cercopithecids, we have not included these alu sequences in the analyses. for platyrrhine alu lineages, however, more confident inferences can be made.

tree topologies recovered using bayesian and parsimony criteria were generally congruent . minor differences in the placement of some sequences are observed but the well-supported clades recovered by the bayesian analysis are often present in the parsimony consensus trees with reasonable support . however, bootstrap support on the parsimony-based cladogram was not as high for several of the major nodes found on the bayesian tree. we suspect that this is due to the hybrid  nature of  <dig> sequences that share diagnostic features of both alusc-derived and alusp derived elements . given the assumptions inherent in parsimony-based analyses  hybrid elements that accumulated a whole suite of character states as a unit and that define other lineages in the data set would be expected to cause significant problems. supplemental analyses with the hybrid elements removed confirmed this suspicion by raising support values at some nodes over  <dig> points . the reduced tree-search method used is also thought to recover lower bootstrap support values than more traditional methods  <cit> . for these reasons, we have chosen to base our major conclusions on the topology and support values present on the bayesian tree.

within that tree, the established relationships between canonical alu consensus sequences were recovered as expected. the alujb subfamily is basal to the remaining alu sequences and relationships between the various alus subfamilies are similar to the results of kapitonov and jurka  <cit> . among the new world primate alu sequences all but three platyrrhine-specific sequences fall within a well supported alusc-aluy derived clade. this topology suggests that at there may have been three alu lineages active at the time of the platyrrhine-catarrhine divergence around 35– <dig> million years ago  <cit> : an aluy progenitor; alusp; and, alusc. the three platyrrhine-specific alu insertions that clustered outside the major platyrrhine alusc/aluy-derived clade were 'all_nwm_locus_1', 'all_nwm_locus_15', and 'all_nwm_locus_31'. each of these insertions is present in all tested platyrrhine taxa, suggesting that they occurred before the radiation of the new world monkeys into three recognized families, . the alu sequence at 'all_nwm_locus_1' appears to be derived from an alusp source gene. direct observation of the alu sequence confirms the presence of several alusp diagnostic sites in this element . based on our analyses, the sequence for 'all_nwm_locus_15' appears to be derived from an aluy progenitor. there is no significant support for the node, however, and it should be noted that this is merely a suggestion based on the topology of the tree. thus, an aluy progenitor, alusp, and alusc were all active around the time of the split. the source of the sequence at 'all_nwm_locus_31' is unclear given the differences in placement between the bayesian and parsimony analyses. repeatmasker  <cit>  lists the element as belonging to the alusg lineage. thus, it may represent a fourth lineage that was active early in the evolution of new world monkeys.

a majority of the alu sequences specific to various new world monkeys are most closely related to an alusc and there are four well-supported clades within this group. clade a is represented by two sequences that were found only in members of pitheciidae. the insertions 'callicebus_83' and 'pithecia_46', were specific to their respective pitheciid genera, and they share eight exclusive non-cpg mutations when compared to alusc and other alusc-like sequences . the close relationship between these sequences was also recovered in the parsimony analysis. while we will not assign them to a new subfamily based on only two sequences, we suggest that they are good candidates for a pitheciid-specific lineage.

a second clade  within the putative alusc-derived group was also highly supported  and was represented an insertion identified in all platyrrhine primates , as well as in two atelid taxa  and in all members of cebidae and atelidae . these sequences may represent an alusc-derived subfamily. however, this cluster was based on only a few sequences and on shared mutations at cpg sites; thus, it should be interpreted cautiously. an alternative is that these and the other elements in this group represent true alusc insertions that have continued to accumulate in platyrrhine genomes throughout their evolution. this is not unlikely given the recent observations of potentially polymorphic alusc loci  <cit>  and relatively recent alusx insertions in humans  <cit> . the 'stealth' model of alu evolution and dispersal reported by han et al.  <cit>  also predicts low levels of activity for older alu subfamiles. alusc may represent a hardy subfamily that has remained active at a low level for long periods of time in a variety of primate genomes.

clade c  comprises five sequences characterized by  <dig> shared mutations  that distinguish them from alusc. sequences in this clade are distributed among members of families pitheciidae and atelidae. one interpretation of this pattern is the emergence of the source gene prior to the expansion of a pitheciid-cebid clade but after the divergence of atelid taxa. this hypothesis is unlikely, however, given the results of ray et al.  <cit>  in which it was made clear that family pitheciidae was the first to diverge from the early platyrrhine groups. we suggest instead that the source gene emerged after the divergence of platyrrhine and catarrhine primates but before the platyrrhine radiation 17– <dig> mya  <cit> , and that none of these elements was recovered for cebid taxa due to sampling error. additional work will be required to test this hypothesis.

clade d is the largest of the clearly definable platyrrhine alu clades, comprising  <dig> sequences from all three platyrrhine families. it is well-supported  and is distinguished by numerous shared mutations among its members. of the new subfamilies described here, this lineage is particularly interesting because of its apparently unique origin. close examination of the sequences reveals four shared alusc diagnostic mutations at the 5' end of the elements; however, at the 3' end of the elements, there are five additional diagnostic sites characteristic of the alusp subfamily. examples of 'hybrid' elements have been described previously  <cit> , but these represented individual instances involving the gene conversion of alu elements already present in the genome. that does not appear to be the case here.

the presence of  <dig> distinct elements harboring this combination of alusc and alusp diagnostic mutations  suggests that there is a recently active source gene with these characteristics. we propose that a source gene  existed early in platyrrhine primate evolution and that the 3' end of the element was subjected to a gene conversion event via any of the three potential models described by kass et al.  <cit> . starting somewhere between bases  <dig> and  <dig> and continuing to the end of the element, the conversion event resulted in the replacement of the sequence of the source gene with sequence from an alusp-like element . the result was a 'fusion' element that remained active and may still be active in the genomes of several platyrrhine primates.

this group of elements can be further subdivided into two subfamilies based on additional shared diagnostic mutations in what appears to be the more recently derived subfamily. in addition to the alusp and alusc derived sites and the three additional distinguishing sites,  <dig> elements share four unique mutations. thus, clade d can be subdivided into two subfamilies consisting of  <dig> and  <dig> elements, respectively .

these two subfamilies share two diagnostic positions with the previously mentioned clade c 5' to the appearance of the alusp indicative sites. thus, we believe that these three groups of sequences represent a new platyrrhine-specific subfamily we dubbed alut. we chose this designation based on the nomenclature proposed by batzer et al.  <cit>  in which younger subfamilies are assigned later letters of the alphabet. this is followed by a lowercase letter designating the order of publication, and a numerical designation indicating the number of diagnostic sites that differentiate it from the subfamily consensus. because this group was similar to and apparently derived from alusc, alut was most appropriate. it is distinguished from alusc by the two aforementioned diagnostic mutations and can currently be divided into three subfamilies; aluta <dig>  aluta <dig>  and aluta <dig> . for reference, we have included a hypothetical alut consensus sequence based on the diagnostic sites shared by the ta <dig>  ta <dig>  and ta <dig> consensi and the presumed ancestral sequence, alusc, in figure  <dig> 

represented by  <dig> sequences, aluta <dig> was only found in cebid taxa . aluta <dig> is represented by ten sequences and was recovered in members of all three platyrrhine families. the distribution of this subfamily of elements among platyrrine taxa and the pattern of shared diagnostic sites suggest that the aluta <dig> family expanded earlier in platyrrhine evolution and may have given rise to the aluta <dig> subfamily. a larger sample based solely on elements derived from unbiased methods will be required to test this hypothesis and is currently underway.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of three  new subfamilies that are unique to platyrrhine primates represents a step forward in our understanding of the evolution of alu elements in the genomes of non-hominid primates. further, this is the first report of a unique mechanism of alu subfamily generation. until now, the evolution of alu subfamilies could easily be described using the sequential accumulation of diagnostic mutations. for example, the hominid alu subfamily aluyb currently consists of four variants, yb <dig>  yb <dig>  yb <dig>  and yb <dig>  <cit> . patterns of sequence variation clearly illustrate the hierarchical nature of sequence evolution in this family. yb <dig> exhibits all of the diagnostic mutations defining aluyb <dig> and aluyb <dig> as well as its own signature mutation. aluyb <dig> follows suit by exhibiting all of the aluyb <dig> mutations plus two others. this pattern is confirmed using age estimates that suggest aluyb <dig> is the oldest and aluyb <dig> is the youngest. the aluta <dig> and aluta <dig> subfamilies represent the first documented cases of a recently active 'fusion' element in which the diagnostic mutations were not accumulated gradually over time; instead, they represent the sudden incorporation of several signature mutations by way of a gene conversion event. thus, a new mechanism of alu subfamily generation, though previously considered possible  <cit> , has now been substantiated in the genome.

on a more practical level, a number of questions raised in other taxonomic analyses of new world monkeys can now be better addressed  <cit>  given the data presented here. we can confidently assign subfamily status to certain individual alu elements in platyrrhine genomes. thus, we are able to target particular alu subfamilies with known expansion timeframes to address branching patterns for particular primate lineages. this technique has previously proven valuable. for example, by combining a targeted analysis of the aluye <dig> subfamily with sequence database searches for additional informative loci, we were able to confidently address the human-chimpanzee-gorilla trichotomy  <cit> . application of similar techniques to other primates can easily be adapted by using the linker protocols described in ray et al.  <cit> , xing et al.  <cit>  and roy et al.  <cit>  and by computational analyses of existing sequence data.

at the population level, the amplification dynamics of alu elements have been well characterized in humans and even in chimpanzees, but have not been investigated extensively in other primates. this is unfortunate given their utility in studies of genome evolution in humans and chimpanzees  <cit> , population biology in humans  <cit> , and phylogenetic analysis at all levels of the primate tree  <cit> . knowledge of these subfamilies will aid in the development of markers useful for all of the above tasks. for example, given the endangered status of many new world taxa, the existence of easy-to-ascertain markers  to identify species-specific alu insertions in tissues of unknown origin will be a boon to conservation biologists and to population geneticists. similar genetic systems have already proven useful in other taxa ranging from humans to waterfowl  <cit> . as one simple example, we now use many of the alu loci used in this study to verify the identity of cell lines in our laboratory. using a single pcr to amplify a taxon-specific alu insertion is quick and efficient when compared to methods that involve morphological analysis  or amplification and sequencing of dna.

in this study we have identified diagnostic mutations for platyrrhine specific subfamilies. the identification of particular alu lineages is the critical first step in identifying polymorphic elements in a primate taxon  <cit> . by identifying the subfamilies that are specific to particular taxa, researchers are now better able to use previously established techniques that take advantage of diagnostic mutations to identify useful markers at various taxonomic levels. the essentially homoplasy free nature of sine markers makes them in some ways superior to other commonly used markers for population genetics  <cit> . thus we see this as the beginning of a series of studies in which the sine method of population genetic analysis will be expanded beyond our own species.
