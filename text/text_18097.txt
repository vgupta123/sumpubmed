BACKGROUND
very succinctly plant-bacteria interactions can be thought as governed at molecular level mainly by three types of proteins: plant prrs , bacterial effectors and plant resistance proteins. prrs are proteins recognizing highly conserved structures and molecules in microorganisms named mamp  and mediate mamp-triggered immunity , which is efficient against non-adapted pathogens. pathogens have developed effector proteins to suppress mti. in turn, plants can counteract the action of effector by the specific recognition of effectors mediated by resistance proteins which will trigger a strong defence response known as eti   <cit> .

during the past decade, small rnas have also been found to be key players in mediating plant-pathogen interactions as well as many other biological processes. micrornas  are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. they are transcribed from nuclear mirna genes by rna polymerase ii  into primary mirnas . the pri-mirnas are then processed in plants by dicer-like proteins  into precursor mirnas  which form a characteristic hairpin-like structure  <cit> . a subsequent processing step by dcl slices the pre-mirna to form a mirna:mirna* duplex . the duplex is then methylated and exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is recognized by an argonaute  protein and incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex . only the mature mirna strand  is retained in the complex, while the passenger  strand becomes degraded  <cit> . however, in some cases, mirna* has been detected as being expressed at the same or even at higher levels than the leader strand and may have silencing activity  <cit> . the risc complex will guide complementary mrna  silencing, usually by cleavage between the 10th and 11thnt of the paired mirna  <cit> .

an early mirna pathway control mechanism comes from mirna gene transcription regulation by cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting factors. recent works have attempted to identify key elements involved in mirna regulation  <cit> ; however, little is yet known about mirna co-regulation under different conditions and the mechanisms involved.

most known plant mirnas target transcription factors which play an important role in regulating plant development. there is now increasing evidence of mirna's importance in response to biotic and abiotic stress in plants  <cit> . reprogrammed mirna-mediated gene expression during plant immune response has not been studied in depth, but is potentially an important element for controlling pathogen invasion. it has been demonstrated that bacteria-induced mir <dig> mediates anti-bacterial defense of a. thaliana against pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  by targeting tir <dig>  an f-box family of auxin receptors and consequently repressing auxin signaling  <cit> . in turn, bacteria use effector proteins to disrupt mirna accumulation  <cit> . the repertoire of known bacterial-responsive mirnas has increased and includes several families known to regulate hormone signaling, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> involved in auxin signaling, mir <dig> involved in aba signaling and mir <dig> involved in jasmonic acid signaling  <cit> .

cassava  is a staple crop which stores important quantities of starch in its roots. these roots constitute the main source of calories for more than half a billion people around the world, mainly in tropical regions  <cit> . the starch also has important uses in industry, including bioethanol production  <cit> . cassava has remarkable tolerance to abiotic stress, it can be cultivated in low-fertility acidic soils and is highly tolerant to drought  <cit> . its production can be severely affected by cassava bacterial blight , caused by gram-negative bacteria xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis . this disease is present in all regions where cassava is grown and production losses can reach up to 80% or 100%  <cit> . cbb incidence, as that of many plant diseases, is expected to increase greatly with climate change  <cit> . this, along with the increasing human population, makes it essential to understand the underlying mechanism of plant antibacterial defense, aimed at producing biotechnological strategies for crop genetic improvement.

the cassava mirna repertoire is mostly unknown. up to  <dig> conserved mirna families have been indentified in ests collections by using bioinformatics approaches  <cit>  and the expression of  <dig> mature mirna families in cassava and other euphorbiaceous has been studied  <cit> . however no mirnas from cassava are currently deposited in mirbase, the consensus database for verified mirnas  <cit> . the first draft of the cassava genome was released in october  <dig> and a new version was made available in october  <dig>  <cit> . this is an important tool for the discovery and prediction of new and specific cassava mirnas.

this study characterizes the cassava mirna repertoire using expression data from small rna libraries and identifies pre-mirnas in the cassava genome. the mirna-mediated response to xam infection in cassava is also analyzed as well as possible transcription factors involved in mirna regulation.

RESULTS
deep sequencing of cassava srna libraries
small rna profiling libraries sequenced with illumina sbs technology were used to study the role of cassava mirnas in response to xam. two small rna libraries were constructed using rna extracted from leaves and stems from the xam-resistant cassava variety mbra <dig>  one of them was not inoculated  and the other inoculated  with the highly aggressive xam strain cio <dig>  the inoculated library was constructed from an rna pool of various post-inoculation times so only robust and consistent responses could be detected.  <dig> and  <dig> million reads trimmed reads  were obtained from the ni and i libraries, respectively . most trimmed reads in both libraries were in the 20-24nt range  . processed and raw files for these libraries can be accessed at the ncbi gene expression omnibus under accession number gse <dig> 

*percentages and normalized values throughout the work were calculated on these total reads. +percentage for non-redundant reads were calculated based on these total reads

reads from both libraries were mapped to the cassava genome , resulting in eight million  and seven million  reads perfectly mapping to the genome. reads mapping to known snornas, trnas, and rrnas were then removed and  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained from the ni and i libraries, respectively, and used for further analysis.

both libraries were also mapped against the xam genome to verify the presence of nucleic acids from bacteria in the i but not in the ni library . as expected, fewer reads from the ni library mapped the xam genome  compared to the i library . most ni reads matching the xam genome also matched the cassava genome  and were thus shared short regions between both genomes. only 33% of the i reads mapping to the xam genome corresponded to these shared regions; the remaining 67% may represent non-coding rna or degraded rna from xam.

mirna and pre-mirna identification
to identify conserved mirnas, reads from both libraries were mapped to a set of known plant mirnas from mirbase  <cit>  and pmrd  <cit> ;  <dig> conserved mirna families were identified in cassava. reads mapping to known mirna were predominantly 21nt long . these mirnas were also screened using mirprof  <cit>  and all  <dig> families were confirmed with this method. unlike mirbase, pmrd includes mirnas without experimental validation. only seven pmrd-exclusive mirna families mapped against small rna cassava libraries; these were taken into account for pre-mirna identification but no precursor could be identified in the cassava genome and were excluded from later analysis.

reads for the  <dig> conserved mirnas families were mapped against the genome and  <dig> adjacent regions were analyzed finding that  <dig> met the main criteria for being considered as real pre-mirnas . these pre-mirnas represented  <dig> mirna families . pre-mirnas for some families were not found which could be explained by considering the cassava genome incomplete sequencing or the presence of non-canonical pre-mirnas.

to identify novel mirnas, reads ranging from  <dig> to 24nt from both libraries were mapped against cassava intergenic regions  and the adjacent Â± 150nt region was extracted . mirchek  <cit> , mipred  <cit>  and mireap  <cit>  were used for initial filtering of possible pre-mirnas. candidates meeting the main criteria mentioned above , as well as having supporting evidence from mircheck, mireap or mipred, were considered to be real pre-mirnas. twelve new mirna precursors from  <dig> mirna families were identified and named cass_mira through cass_mirl  .

reads mapping to the predicted novel mirnas were mostly 21nt long, as was observed for conserved mirnas . a blastn  <cit>  search of genbank's nucleotide nr database for high pre-mirna conservation in other plant genomes revealed no similarity  with plant nucleotide sequences different from cassava in  <dig> out of the  <dig> pre-mirna families, whereas two pre-mirnas, cass-mirk and cass_mirl, resemble non-coding sequences from populus thricocarpa and helianthus petiolari respectively.

target prediction
targets were predicted for all mirnas identified among annotated genes in the cassava genome using a modified version of miranda software  <cit> ;  <dig> possible targets for  <dig> conserved mirna families were identified as well as  <dig> targets for the  <dig> new mirna families . targets were also searched for all mirnas in the cassava genome using psrnatarget http://plantgrn.noble.org/psrnatarget/. additional support as real targets was obtained for  <dig> out of the  <dig> targets identified with miranda . a high percentage of possible targets identified were transcription factors , as is common for many known plant mirnas  <cit> . other commonly predicted targets were kinases , dna binding proteins  and disease resistance proteins . four families  had among their possible targets genes involved in starch biosynthesis or metabolism, as identified by similarity with genes in the kegg pathway , which could be important focus points for biotechnological strategies aiming at bioethanol production.

mirna differential expression
cassava's mirnas expression levels were quantified as normalized reads mapping to each mature mirna in both libraries.  <dig> conserved mirna families had highly increased expression  in response to xam infection , including mir <dig> and mir <dig> families which are both known to target auxin response factors   <cit>  and mir <dig> and mir <dig> families which are also known to regulate auxin signaling  <cit> . predicted targets for mir <dig> in cassava were arf-like genes whereas predicted targets for mir <dig> included phosphatases and peptidases. these targets' downregulation in response to bacteria was confirmed through semi-quantitative rt-pcr . it was possible to confirm predicted target downregulation for other induced conserved mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> which target an f-box family protein, an athb transcription factor and a scarecrow-like transcription factor, respectively . in some of these cases  target expression decreased at  <dig> days post-inoculation  and then increased at  <dig> dpi, but never reached higher expression values than those without inoculation. this can be expected since libraries were constructed from an rna pooled from different times post inoculation. in spite of the importance of these data, a time specific quantification of mature mirnas is still needed to make an accurate correlation with target expression.

on the other hand seven mirna families' expression became reduced in response to xam infection  . these repressed families included mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> which were predicted to target various candidate nb-lrr and lrr disease resistance proteins. the mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> families were also repressed ; they are involved in copper regulation by targeting laccases, copper superoxide dismutases and plantacyanins, respectively  <cit> . it was possible to confirm bacteria-induced increased expression for a resistance-like protein predicted to be targeted by mir <dig>  and for a plantacyanin predicted to be targeted by mir <dig>  .

novel mirnas had overall low expression levels. only three novel mirnas  had expression values higher than  <dig> normalized reads in at least one library. thus, while many showed differential expression in response to bacteria they were not taken into account due to their low expression values. species-specific mirnas are known to have low expression compared to conserved mirnas  <cit> . cass_mire was highly induced in response to bacteria   and downregulation of its predicted target, a kinase related to a. thaliana feronia, was determined by rt-pcr . this gene is known to be involved in pathogen interactions and pollen development  <cit> .

the passenger strand  becomes rapidly degraded after mirna:mirna* duplex disruption and leader strand incorporation into risc  <cit> . its expression can nevertheless be detected in small rna libraries and it is considered supporting criteria for mirna validation  <cit> . mirna* expression for cassava mirnas was quantified as the number of reads in each library strand-specifically mapping to cassava mirnas* predicted from pre-mirnas. mirna* expression was detected for  <dig> conserved mirna families. all families had mirna/mirna* ratios higher than  <dig> in both ni and i libraries, meaning that as expected the leader strand was always more highly expressed than the passenger strand. the mirna/mirna* ratio changed for each mirna family between ni and i library . a change in mirna/mirna* ratio may have indicated differential degradation of the mirna* strand in different conditions; however, it was most likely a stochastic effect due to the detection of degrading molecules.

it is thought that mirna silencing signal can be amplified by the production of transient sirnas derived from cleaved target mrnas  <cit> . reads from both libraries were specifically mapped to predicted cassava mirna targets' sense or antisense strand to assess the extent to which transitivity or mirna silencing signal amplification occurred in cassava. reads mapping to the antisense strand would indicate the presence of dsrna-derived transitive sirnas after rdrp recognition, while reads mapping to the sense strand are likely to be predominantly cleaved mirna target products as well as possible sirnas. the percentage of predicted mirna targets with reads mapping to the antisense strand  in both libraries was around 10% . reads mapping to mirna targets' antisense strand  were around 1% of reads mapping to predicted targets , i.e. possible transitive sirna expression. this showed that only a small percentage of targeted genes produced transitive sirnas and they were produced in very small amounts compared to mirna target cleavage rate. these results suggest that mirna signaling amplification through target transitivity is not a prevalent mechanism in cassava.

promoter analysis
mirna genes are transcribed by rna pol-ii after recognition by transcription factors; however, little is known about mirna transcriptional regulation  <cit> . transcription factor binding sites  were identified in the 1000nt promoter region upstream of identified cassava pre-mirnas to find possible patterns in mirna gene regulation in response to bacteria. binding sites for  <dig> transcription factors were identified in  <dig> mirna promoter regions. commonly found regulatory motifs included the tata and gata box and rav  and lfy  tfbs .

it has been found that arf binding sites are over-represented in auxin-related mirna families like mir <dig> and mir <dig>  thus forming a regulatory loop  <cit> . in our results mir <dig> was also the family having the most arf binding sites identified .

the same predictions were then made in promoter regions of cassava mirna target genes and a set of  <dig>  randomly-chosen cassava genes to determine whether mirnas were differently transcribed from other groups of genes. paired wilcoxon tests were made comparing the frequency distributions in each group finding significant differences  between mirna genes and randomly selected genes  and between mirna genes and mirna targets , whereas no differences were found between target genes and randomly selected genes . however, no significant differences were found between the frequency distributions of mirna families highly induced or repressed in response to bacteria and those of non-differentially expressed mirna families .

discussion
a general model has been proposed based on arabidopsis-pseudomonas interaction results describing mirna-mediated response to bacterial infection. in this model mirnas targeting negative defense response regulators are induced and mirnas targeting positive regulators  are repressed upon bacterial infection  <cit> . in this work we reported the differential expression of some cassava mirna families in response to xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis, generally agreeing with this model. mirnas induction was found to be involved in regulating auxin signaling: mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> . conservation of these mirna families' expression pattern in arabidopsis and cassava pointed to a plant conserved defense mechanism, likely to be related to pti, since some of these families have been shown to be induced in response to flagellin  <cit> . thus, auxin signaling disruption seems to be an important strategy for impairing bacterial growth in plants. recent work has shown that enzymatic disruption of auxin signaling is an important mechanism for broad-spectrum resistance and that pathogens secrete auxins during infection to render a plant vulnerable by loosening the cell wall  <cit> . some conserved mirna families not present in a. thaliana were induced expressed in response to xam infection, including mir <dig> and mir <dig> families which have so far only been identified in populus euphratica and physcomithrella patens, respectively  <cit> . the role they might play in mediating plant-bacteria interactions remains unknown.

mirna downregulation showed in this work also agrees with the general model, since three repressed families  were predicted to target nb-lrr and lrr resistance-like genes in cassava. these genes' subsequent increased expression may have a role in cassava-specific eti response; however, this still needs to be demonstrated. other repressed families were mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  known to be involved in copper regulation and to be differentially expressed in response to biotic stress  <cit> . copper is widely used as a pesticide in agriculture due to its antibacterial effect  <cit> . it has been shown that some xanthomonas oryzae strains use transcription activator-like  effector proteins to modify copper distribution in rice to render the plant susceptible  <cit> . mirna-mediated regulation of copper homeostasis could also be crucial as a bacterial defense mechanism.

transitivity was analyzed by quantifying possible target cleavage-derived transient sirnas. this mechanism has been studied in detail for some specific cases in a. thaliana  <cit>  and in the moss physcomitrella patens  <cit> . a recent study has suggested, however, that the mechanism could be more widespread than once thought; analyzing next-generation sequencing of small rna libraries, the same percentage was found for small 21nt reads mapped against arabidopsis mirna targets in both sense and antisense strands  <cit> . on the contrary, it was found in this work that reads mapping o cassava targets' antisense strand were greatly under-represented in cassava libraries  and only around 10% of predicted targets produced antisense reads, agreeing with transitivity being an infrequent mechanism.

finally, tfbs were predicted on the promoter region of mirna genes finding that mirna genes appeared to have overall a different frequency distribution from those of protein coding genes including mirna targets suggesting the presence of regulatory elements acting specifically on mirna genes. it has been previously reported that mirna genes are abundant in tata-box, atmyc, arf, sorlep <dig> and lfy binding sites, compared to protein encoding genes  <cit> . in our results the frequency distribution of tfbs in these groups of genes reveals that namely the tata-box, myb <dig> and l1-box motifs were more abundant in mirna genes. however, no differences in tfbs frequencies could be found between bacteria-induced or bacteria-repressed mirna families and families that were not differentially, this suggests that mirna transcriptional regulation in response to bacteria may be family-specific or loci-specific.

CONCLUSIONS
this work has shown in-depth characterization of cassava mirnas in response to xam infection and has shed new light on these molecules' importance in plant-pathogen interactions. these data are encouraging but still preliminary and further experimental validation is still needed to fully understand the impact of the mirna pathway in the cassava-xam interaction. understanding mirna regulation and/or that of their targets could  lead to developing better biotechnological strategies aimed at producing cassava plants having enhanced resistance to pathogens.
