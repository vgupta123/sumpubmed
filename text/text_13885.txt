BACKGROUND
nanoparticles  offer spectacular properties to their bulk materials, such as a high surface area to volume ratio, new mechanical, chemical, electrical, optical, magnetic, electro-optical, and magneto-optical properties  <cit> . nanotechnology is one of the fastest growing areas of the high tech economy  <cit> , <cit> . products using nanoparticles - also known as nanomaterials -can be found in almost every area of our daily lives, from cosmetics to clothing to foods to drug products  <cit> - <cit> . there are hundreds of cosmetics that contain nanomaterials, such as zno, tio <dig>  and sio <dig>  in the market now and the number of these products are increasing rapidly  <cit> . nanoscale materials can find use in many areas related to the food industry including agriculture, food processing, food security, packaging, nutrition and neutraceuticals  <cit> - <cit> . nanoscale materials have been used as novel antimicrobial agents  <cit> . due to their powerful antimicrobial activity and particular modes of action, nanoparticles provide an attractive alternative to classic antibiotics in the development of next-generation antibiotic agents  <cit> - <cit> . various antimicrobial nanoparticles and nanosized carriers for antibiotics delivery have been developed to effectively treat infectious diseases, especially those caused by antibiotic-resistant microorganisms  <cit> , <cit> . nanoparticles behave differently from their respective bulk materials and thus the unique properties of the nanoparticles might also cause adverse health effects on human, animal and environment. the speedy commercialization of nanotechnology requires thoughtful and careful environmental, animal and human health safety assessment  <cit> , <cit> .

the detection and quantification of viable bacteria plays a critical role in quality control programs of the food, cosmetics and drug industry to prevent illness and in clinical diagnosis and therapeutics. currently there are many methods used for the detection and quantification of bacteria, ncluding conventional and molecular approaches  <cit> - <cit> . conventionally identification of bacteria is usually performed by three methods including culture-based counting for colony-forming units   <cit> , <cit> , spectrophotometer method of optical density  measurement  <cit> , <cit> , and flow cytometry   <cit> , <cit> . in spite of the sensitivity and reliability, counting cfu is time-consuming and labor-intensive  <cit> , <cit> . cfu determination is the conventional method to quantify bacteria, but only detects those that are able to grow on specific solid media, which excludes the detection of unculturable live, inactive or damaged bacterial cells  <cit> , <cit> . therefore, cfu counting tends to undercount the actual number of the bacteria. for example, anaerobic bacteria are not able to grow on the media and cultural conditions suitable for growth of aerobic bacteria. optical density method measures turbidity associated directly with bacterial growth which is rapid, low cost and non-destructive, however, it measures live as well as dead bacterial cell debris. flow cytometry is a relatively newly developed technique and enables a fast and reliable detection of all bacteria including the non-cultivable microorganisms. it enables researchers to reliably distinguish and quantitate live and dead bacteria with the aid of a flow cytometer in a mixed population containing various bacterial types  <cit> . besides, flow cytometry method is able to provide morphometric and functional properties of the detected bacteria  <cit> , <cit> . currently all these three methods are employed to quantify bacterial contents in the presence of nanoparticles  <cit> - <cit> . so far there has not been any research performed concerning potential interference by nanoparticles on the bacterial counting methods.

the aim of this study was to compare three commonly used conventional methods for bacterial detection and quantification in the presence of nanoparticles. in this study, three nanoparticles, zno, tio <dig>  and sio <dig>  which are commonly used in commercial products and four important human pathogens  frequently found in various products and environment representing gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were employed for this study.

RESULTS
physical and chemical characterizations of nanomaterials
it is critical to conduct physical and chemical characterization of testing nanomaterials in nanotechnology research. size, size distribution, surface charge, aggregation or agglomeration status, and shape have been considered as the most important parameters for nanomaterials. we evaluated these parameters using tem and zetasizer as described in the material and methods section. tem analysis indicated that the zno, tio <dig> and sio <dig> nanoparticles have spherical shape with slightly agglomeration . the primary size of zno, tio <dig> and sio <dig> nanoparticles were measured as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm, respectively . the range of the diameter of the zno, tio <dig> and sio <dig> nanoparticle was  <dig> - <dig>  nm,  <dig> - <dig>  nm and  <dig> - <dig>  nm. zetasizer analysis indicated that the average size of zno, tio <dig> and sio <dig> nanoparticles in buffer solution was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . the average surface charge of the zno, tio <dig>  sio <dig> nanoparticles in buffer solution was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, − <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, respectively . tem directly measured the primary size of the nanoparticles based on the projected area; while dynamic light scattering  measured the hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles based on the translational diffusion area of the particle being measured. the same samples of these nanoparticles in buffer were measured with a bigger size by zetasizer analysis than the measurement using tem. this is due to the differences in the weighted averages determined by these two techniques, and also the differences in the physical properties measured. tem is sensitive to the size of primary particles, whereas dls is sensitive to the presence of small quantities of large particles or aggregates.

effect of concentrations of nanoparticle on quantification of bacteria
potential interference of nanoparticles on the quantification of bacteria poses a challenge for the detection of bacterial contaminations in various consumer products. therefore, development of a rapid, sensitive and accurate method for detection of bacteria in the presence of nanoparticles is crucial for food, drug, cosmetic and other consumable products. among many bacterial identification and quantification methods, three of them including culture-based counting for cfu, spectrophotometer method of optical density measurement, and more recently flow cytometry are commonly used. zno, tio <dig>  and sio <dig> have been found in many commercial products including food, food supplements, cosmetics and drugs. s. enterica newport, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and e. coli, which are important human pathogens, are good representatives for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria . in this experiment the effect of various concentrations of nanoparticles on quantification of s. enterica newport, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and e. coli was investigated by exposing 5 ml of samples containing approximately  <dig> cells/ml to various concentrations of zno, tio <dig>  and sio <dig>  for 1 hr, respectively . as shown in table  <dig>  with increasing concentrations of zno, tio <dig>  and sio <dig>  there was no apparent interference of the nanoparticles on quantifications of all four bacterial species by flow cytometry measurement using the baclight live/dead bacterial viability and counting kit. as shown in figure  <dig> as example, two distinctive groups were formed. group p <dig> was the population of living bacterial cells, while group p <dig> was the population of dead bacterial cells at the presence of  <dig>  mg/ml nanoparticles. compared to a control, which did not contain nanoparticles, no shifts of the bacterial population or background increase were observed . since more than  <dig>  bacterial cells per sample were counted by flow cytometry measurement, high accuracy and excellent reproducibility of the quantification was achieved for both live and dead bacterial cells . although no apparent interference of the nanoparticles on quantifications of all four bacterial species was observed by using cfu counting, it was a time consuming and labor intensive procedure. besides, it took long time training and practice for mastering the technique of dilution in order to get reliable counts from one batch to another and from one plate to another in cfu counting. furthermore, the data obtained by cfu measurement is less accurate and reproducible due to a limited number of bacterial cells counted . the decreasing numbers of the bacteria by using cfu and flow cytometry were resulted from antibacterial effects caused by both nanoparticles tio <dig> and zno. as shown in table  <dig>  nanoparticles had adverse effect on quantification of bacteria using the spectrophotometer method of optical density measurement with severity of tio2 > zno > sio <dig>  for example, in the presence of  <dig>  mg tio <dig>  the number of s. epidermidis cells was not detectable due to high background interference from the nanoparticles in the samples. with  <dig>  mg/ml tio <dig>  s. enterica newport and e. faecalis cells were  <dig>  and  <dig> % of those measured by fca, respectively. on the other hand, e. coli cells were more than 8-folds than that by fca in the presence of  <dig>  mg/ml tio <dig>

effect of bacterial concentrations on quantification of bacteria after exposure to nanoparticles
in this experiment, we further investigated interference of nanoparticles zno , tio <dig> , and sio <dig>  on quantifications of s. enterica newport, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and e. coli with various bacterial concentrations by comparison of flow cytometry with optical density measurement. as shown in table  <dig>  with the decreasing concentrations of the tested bacteria, no apparent interference of the nanoparticles on quantifications of all four bacterial species by flow cytometry was observed. however, with decreasing concentrations of the tested bacteria, the adverse effect on quantification of bacteria was dramatically increased using the spectrophotometer method of optical density measurement, which reflected a progressively worse estimate of the bacterial counts as the ratio of numbers of bacteria and nanoparticles in the suspension decreased. for example, in the presence of  <dig>  mg tio <dig>  number of s. enterica newport cells could not be detected due to high background interference from the nanoparticles in the samples. s. enterica newport, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis could not be quantified in the presence of  <dig>  mg/ml tio <dig>  the data obtained from the bacterial quantification in the presence of  <dig>  mg/ ml of zno were either not able to be detected or not accurate. due to lower interference of sio <dig> at 1 mg/ml on the bacterial quantification, there was no apparent difference between flow cytometry and optical density measurement .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study compared three most commonly used bacterial quantification methods including colony counts, spectrophotometer method of optical density measurement, and flow cytometry in the presence of metal oxide nanoparticles. our results demonstrated that flow cytometry is the best method with no apparent interference by the nanoparticles, indicating that it is suitable for rapid, accurate and automatic detection of bacteria. flow cytometry is also able to detect both live and dead bacterial cells and allows detection of all bacteria including those that are uncultured. although the bacterial quantification determined by plate counts was not affected by the nanoparticles, it was time consuming, less accurate and not suitable for automation. the spectrophotometer method using optical density measurement was the most unreliable method to quantify and detect bacteria in the presence of oxide nanoparticles. the data presented in this study indicated that flow cytometry method for bacterial quantification is superior to the other two methods. this study provides data examining the potential interference of oxide nanoparticles on bacterial quantification. the information provided here will be useful in the assessment of bacterial contamination in food, drug and cosmetic products containing nanoparticles. future studies on other nanoparticles and limit of the bacterial detection by fmc are warranted.
