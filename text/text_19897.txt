BACKGROUND
extreme-acid survival is an important virulence factor for human pathogens such as e. coli strain o157:h <dig>  <cit> . in order to colonize the gastrointestinal tract, escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria must be able to grow in environments at extreme ph such as the duodenum  and the stomach   <cit> . in the gastrointestinal tract, enteric bacteria are subjected to acid stress from strong acid  as well as bacterial fermentation products such as acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, which are membrane-permeant weak acids  <cit> . e. coli preserves the integrity of proteins and nucleic acids present in the cytoplasm by maintaining cytoplasmic ph at approximately ph  <dig> , over a wide range of external ph  <cit> . low ph up-regulates genes required for survival under more extreme acid conditions, such as the arginine- and glutamate-dependent acid resistance systems  <cit> .

in e. coli k- <dig>  many studies show that adaptation to low or high ph stress involves regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis, as well as post-translational and regulation of protein function  <cit> . for example, acid induces the lysine decarboxylase operon cadba under control of the signal-transducing regulator cadc  <cit> . lysine decarboxylase  removes co <dig> from lysine, releasing cadaverine, a base that counteracts acidity. other kinds of genes up-regulated by acid include periplasmic chaperones, inner-membrane and outer-membrane proteins, acetate-stress proteins, and systems utilizing the proton gradient, such as motility and chemotaxis  <cit> . base-induced proteins include fermentation pathways generating acidic products, and metabolic complexes that import protons or minimize proton export, such as the f1fo atpase and cytochrome d oxidoreductase   <cit> .

while gene expression as a function of steady-state external ph has received extensive study, less is known about the dynamic response of e. coli to a sudden ph change. rapid acidification  of the external medium causes the cytoplasmic ph to fall, followed by recovery within minutes to close to the original value  <cit> . for the cadba operon, expression is upregulated within  <dig> min of rapid acidification, and downregulated within  <dig> min after ph neutralization  <cit> . but other genes showing ph-dependent expression ratios under growth for several generations at different ph values may be dependent on secondary effects of growth with ph stress. the gene products required to recover from rapid change in external ph  may differ substantially from those elevated or repressed during steady-state growth at low or high ph, where ph homeostasis is maintained. furthermore, few studies distinguish the effects of cytoplasmic versus external ph on gene expression; for example, yfid expression responds to membrane-permeant weak acids that depress cytoplasmic ph without affecting external ph  <cit> .

in this study we used microarray hybridization to investigate the transcriptomic response to a sudden acid shift. this approach enabled us to distinguish between genes up-regulated immediately upon acid shift, versus those whose expression increases after some time in the presence of acid. genes of interest were followed up with quantitative real-time pcr  using a membrane-permeant weak acid to assess whether the effect of acid treatment could be associated with the decrease of cytoplasmic ph.

RESULTS
cytoplasmic ph change
the effect of external acidification on the e. coli cytoplasmic ph under our experimental conditions was tested, in order to assess the state of the cytoplasm during our transcriptional profiling. the probe used was ph-dependent fluorescence of tetr-yfp  <cit> .

the external ph was acidified by adding hcl  to cell cultures of e. coli w <dig> containing a tetr-yfp plasmid, suspended in media adjusted to ph  <dig> . upon hcl addition, the cytoplasmic ph fell within  <dig> s to approximately ph  <dig>  . recovery began approximately  <dig> s after the cytoplasmic ph reached the lowest point . after  <dig> min, the cytoplasmic ph ranged between ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> . each replicate culture exhibited a biphasic recovery, which is consistent with the recovery pattern previously described by ref  <cit> . as a control, kcl was added instead of hcl  in order to detect changes in fluorescence signal that were independent of ph change. upon kcl addition, there was no significant change in fluorescence signal.

for comparison, the effect of a permeant-acid stress was measured under our experimental conditions  <cit> . addition of a permeant acid such as benzoate at high concentration depresses cytoplasmic ph with little or no recovery, without affecting external ph  <cit> . benzoate  was added to cell cultures of w <dig> containing p-tetr-yfp, which were suspended in media ph adjusted to ph  <dig> . after addition of  <dig> mm benzoate, the cytoplasmic ph fell within  <dig> s to that of the external medium . over the period of  <dig> min during which spectra were recorded, the cytoplasmic ph made a minimal recovery.  buffer  was added as a control, and did not cause a significant change in fluorescence signal.

rna hybridization following rapid acidification
for acid treatment and rna hybridization, e. coli strain w <dig> was cultured to early log phase  at ph  <dig>  . phext  <dig>  is equivalent to the cytoplasmic ph, and thus cells suspended at phext  <dig>  exhibit minimal ph regulated gene expression relative to rapidly acidified cultures. at time zero , hcl was added rapidly, resulting in the acidification of the external medium to ph  <dig> . at time points  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min,  <dig> ml of culture were removed. the ph of the media remained at ph  <dig>   after the  <dig> min sample was taken.

at time points  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min, rna was purified and cdna generated as described under methods. the cdna from five independent cultures of each time-point were hybridized to affymetrix antisense e. coli arrays. model-based expression indices were calculated from the probe-level data from affymetrix dat files using dchip software  <cit> . array data were deposited at the ncbi gene expression omnibus .

time-dependent variation
to determine the effect of time on differential gene expression, the log <dig> transforms of normalized model-based expression values from the microarray probe level data were analyzed during the 10-min interval. a mixed-effects linear model for longitudinal data was applied using the software sas mixed procedure . for each gene, the mixed-effects model was applied at a significance level of  <dig>  to determine whether or not the gene expression profile deviates significantly from a flat line over time, which indicates no time effect. the model takes into account time , the random deviation among biological replicates , and random error to determine significant time-dependence for gene variation  <cit> .

for array hybridization, our experimental design and analysis were consistent with the "consensus" recommendations of allison  <cit>  in that we included an ample number of biological replicates , assuring a low false-positive rate  as well as a high power of detection. the power of detection of changes in gene expression over time was estimated based on the observed biological variation among flask cultures  and the technical error term . the power of detection was estimated for two cases of expression change using a monte carlo simulation based on  <dig>  trials. for a gene whose expression increases two-fold over  <dig> min, the power of detection was 96%. for a gene whose expression increases two-fold by  <dig> min, with partial recovery by  <dig> min, the power of detection was 97%.

of the  <dig>  genes on the array,  <dig>   showed significant time-dependent variation in expression among the four time points. their expression indices and log <dig> expression ratios relative to time zero are tabulated in additional file  <dig>  the percent recovery of expression level was calculated as follows from the values of the log <dig> expression indices  for each gene:

 percent recovery=|−time 10log⁡2)−time 0log⁡2)|× <dig> 

where "peak log2" refers to the highest mean log <dig> of an up-regulated gene , or the lowest mean log <dig> of a down-regulated gene. for example, a gene whose expression increase peaks at 100-fold, then declines to 10-fold, would show 50% recovery with a remaining elevation of 10-fold; thus it would be "half recovered" in that the peak/recovered expression ratio equals the recovered/original expression ratio.

genes that showed a significant increase or decrease in mean expression at  <dig> min and/or  <dig> min, and exhibited less than a 200% recovery , were defined as up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively . following the rapid acid shift,  <dig> genes  were up-regulated and  <dig> genes  were down-regulated. their expression ratios relative to time zero, and their percent recovery, are tabulated. of the genes defined as up-regulated or down-regulated, those whose expression recovered fully by  <dig> min  were designated "transient." thus defined,  <dig> genes  showed transient up-regulation, and  <dig> genes  showed transient down-regulation.

genes that showed up-regulation or down-regulation by  <dig> min, and reached expression ratios of 2-fold or greater, are tabulated in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  respectively. many of these also show ph-dependent expression under steady-state conditions, in a study by maurer et al in which the bacteria were cultured for several generations at ph  <dig> , ph  <dig> , and ph  <dig>   <cit> . the percentage of genes with elevated steady-state expression in acid culture  <cit>  was 19%, for genes up-regulated at  <dig> min; 24%, at  <dig> min; and 34%, at  <dig> min . for genes down-regulated after acid shift, the percentage down-regulated in steady-state acid culture  <cit>  was 17% at  <dig> min, 17% at  <dig> min, and 27% at  <dig> min . thus, the longer a gene showed up-regulation  in our study, the more likely it was to show elevated  expression under steady-state growth at low ph.

a values shown represent the log <dig> ratio of expression indices compared to those at time zero. expression ratios of 2-fold or greater are shown. percent recovery is defined under results; a blank cell indicates recovery could not be defined.

b ref  <cit> 

genes whose up-regulation  was transient would not be expected to show steady-state expression ratios. in fact, of the  <dig> genes showing transient up-regulation to levels 2-fold or greater, none are reported in ref.  <cit> ; and of the  <dig> genes showing transient down-regulation, only one is reported. thus, our study revealed transiently acid-responsive genes that were not observed under steady-state growth conditions.

up-regulated genes following an acid shift
yagu and other acid stress genes of unknown function
the gene encoding inner-membrane protein yagu  <cit>  contributes to acid resistance  <cit>  and is one of the genes most strongly up-regulated  at low ph  <cit> . following acid shift, yagu was one of the top genes up-regulated at  <dig> min, with peak expression at  <dig> min and a 10% recovery at  <dig> min .

the up-regulation of yagu was confirmed by real-time pcr . the time course of yagu expression relative to time  <dig> was similar to that of the microarray data . in order to determine whether up-regulation was related to external ph or cytoplasmic ph, a second time course was conducted using the permeant weak acid benzoate. addition of benzoate to cultures suspended at phext  <dig>  acidifies the cytoplasmic ph while the external ph remains constant. the yagu gene showed no significant up-regulation following benzoate addition. therefore, yagu response is more consistent with direct sensing of external ph, not cytoplasmic ph.

three other genes observed by real-time pcr  showed approximately 16-fold increase in expression after rapid acid shift, but no effect of benzoate addition . expression of yjei recovered after acid shift, but the benzoate experiment ruled out a direct response to cytoplasmic ph. eight other genes tested  increased expression more than 4-fold with full or partial recovery, and were up-regulated after benzoate addition. this pattern is consistent with response to intracellular ph change. the gene fimb encodes the flagellar phase switching mediator fimb  <cit> ; the others have unknown functions. none of these genes were previously reported to be up-regulated by acid.

acid-inducible amino-acid decarboxylases
the most well-documented class of response to external acid is the degradative amino-acid decarboxylases, which convert specific amino acids to amines while exporting a proton  <cit> . all of these were up-regulated within  <dig> min following the acid shift, with little or no recovery. these include the lysine decarboxylase and transporter cadba  <cit>  and the arginine decarboxylase adiy  <cit>   as well as the glutamate decarboxylase and transporter  which are part of the gad acid response regulon  <cit> . other members of the gad regulon up-regulated after the acid shift included gade, gadwx, and evgas.

metabolism and transport
a number of metabolic enzymes and transporters were up-regulated following acid shift. several of these are associated with biofilm formation, such as isocitrate lyase  and malate synthase   <cit> . the proteins of galactitol transport were upregulated strongly . the gat genes are involved in biofilm formation  <cit>  and they show elevated expression in steady-state acid, which appears to favor substrates that produce fewer acidic fermentation products  <cit> . biofilm development genes ymgabc were also up-regulated after acid shift, as was the biofilm-dependent modulation protein bdm  <cit> . the expression levels of ymgabc began recovery by  <dig> min. these genes have not been reported previously to show elevated expression under steady-state acid conditions.

other metabolic genes known for acid-enhanced expression  <cit>  were found to be up-regulated without recovery following acid shift. these include sdhabcd, encoding succinate dehydrogenase,  <cit> ; the dppa, b, c, d, f dipeptide transport system  <cit> ; and glycerol transport components glpd, f, q, t, of which glpd encodes a multidrug-resistance component associated with persister cell formation  <cit> .

osmotic shock response genes
several genes up-regulated after acid shift are associated with osmotic shock, in particular the rcs regulon  <cit> . in the rcs regulon, the transcriptional regulators rcsa and rcsb control expression of genes involved in colanic capsule biosynthesis. the rcs regulon members up-regulated after acid shift included rcsabcd, bdm, and osmb  <cit> . of these, only rcsa shows elevated expression in steady-state acid  <cit> . an osmotic shock gene outside the rcs regulon, osmy  <cit> , also was up-regulated after acid shift.

the fur regulon
the ferric uptake regulator  governs the expression of various acid tolerance genes  <cit> . of the genes that were strongly-up-regulated after rapid acidification, eight are genes previously shown to be controlled by the fur regulon  <cit> , genes whose expression peaked at  <dig> min encode the cadmium induced metal binding protein   <cit> , ygac  <cit> , and the oxidative stress genes nrdh and nrdi  <cit> . the percent recovery of these genes ranged between  <dig> to 80% . fur also regulates the succinate dehydrogenase operon sdhabcd, which is up-regulated by acid under steady-state conditions  <cit>  and was up-regulated after rapid acidification .

many genes of unknown or putative function exhibited expression profiles that paralleled the shift and recovery of cytoplasmic ph. such genes include ygin, whose gene product has recently been isolated and characterized as a quinol monooxygenase  <cit> . the gene ygin exhibited peak up-regulation at  <dig> min and made a 63% recovery by  <dig> min . genes encoding the putative nad+- dependent succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase ynei  <cit>  and the putative periplasmic protein yhcn, exhibited peak expression at  <dig> min and recovered by 57% and 23% respectively .

down-regulated genes following an acid shift
the most strongly down-regulated genes following acid shift are shown in additional file  <dig>  many of these show steady-state elevated expression at high ph.

genes encoding the high-affinity cytochrome oxidoreductase d  are favored under low-oxygen conditions as well as at high ph  <cit> . the genes cyda, b, c were down-regulated following acid shift. similarly, the periplasmic extracytoplasmic response regulator cpxp  <cit>  is strongly up-regulated in base  <cit> . the cpxp gene was down-regulated immediately after acid shift, with little recovery . the gene encoding the base-inducible putative membrane-bound redox modulator alx  <cit>  was also down-regulated, as were the genes encoding serine deaminase and transport, sdaabc . amino-acid deaminases appear to be induced as a response to reverse ph increase  <cit> .

many genes involved in polyamine metabolism and transport show increased expression at high ph  <cit> . several of these were down-regulated following acid shift, including the spermidine metabolism genes spea, b, d, e  <cit>  and polyamine transport genes pota, b, c, d  <cit> .

delayed response to acid shift
some genes showed little or no response to acid shift until the 10-min time point . most striking was the delayed up-regulation of the nuo operon encoding nadh dehydrogenase i  <cit> . thirteen genes of the nuo operon were all up-regulated about 50% at  <dig> min, after little or no significant differences at  <dig> min or  <dig> min. the nadh dehydrogenase i is known to show elevated expression in steady-state acid  <cit>  and under anoxic conditions; its expression declines with aeration  <cit> . our new data showed that nuo expression does not increase immediately with acidity, but as a delayed consequence of the acid shift. the previously reported rise in nadh dehydrogenase could be a consequence of deenergization following acid stress. another complex showing delayed up-regulation by acid was the hslvu protease  <cit> . the hsl genes are known to be up-regulated by acid under steady-state conditions  <cit> . our new data is more consistent with a secondary response to acidification, such as a need to degrade acid-denatured proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
when cultures of e. coli k- <dig> w <dig> were subjected to a rapid decrease in external ph, from ph  <dig>  to ph  <dig> , the cytoplasmic ph decreased but began to recover within less than a minute after the acid shift. up-regulated genes included amino-acid decarboxylases , succinate dehydrogenase , biofilm-associated genes , and components of the gad, fur and rcs regulons. many of the acid-up-regulated genes showed sustained elevation, such as cada and sdhcd. on the other hand, the rapid acid exposure experiment revealed genes whose response to acid shift is transient, such as the biofilm development genes ymgabc and the flagellar phase variation modulator fimb. these genes were up-regulated after benzoate addition, a condition in which cytoplasmic ph is depressed permanently without change in external ph. thus, these genes are candidates for direct response to cytoplasmic acid stress. the acid response of other genes, such as nuo and hsl, was shown to be delayed. their delayed response suggests a secondary effect of growth in acid. overall, our study of gene expression following rapid acid shift or rapid benzoate addition revealed several classes of acid stress response: genes showing sustained up-regulation  following acid shift; genes showing transient up-regulation after acid shift, as well as up-regulation following permeant-acid treatment of the cytoplasm; and genes showing delayed up-regulation after acid shift.
