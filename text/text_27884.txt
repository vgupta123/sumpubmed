BACKGROUND
proteases are essential regulators of pathogenesis in the apicomplexa, a phylum that includes obligate, intracellular protozoan parasites of great human health  and agricultural and economic significance . extensive study of plasmodium species and t. gondii has established that proteases help to coordinate and regulate the lifecycles of these parasites, playing key roles in host cell invasion, general catabolism, host cell remodelling and egress from host cells  <cit> . these processes are all associated with the asexual stages of apicomplexan parasites. by contrast, relatively little is known about what roles proteases may play in the sexual phase of the apicomplexan lifecycle though it is known that a subtilisin  <dig> is detected specifically in the gametocyte proteome  <cit>  and expression of falcipain  <dig> is upregulated in gametocytes  <cit>  of p. falciparum. moreover, it has been demonstrated that the cysteine protease inhibitor, e64d, or the targeted genetic disruption of falcipain  <dig> can inhibit oocyst production in p. falciparum <cit> . likewise, the proteosome inhibitors, epoxomicin and thiostrepin, exhibit gametocytocidal activity  <cit> .

in comparison to p. falciparum and t. gondii, proteases from eimeria species have been studied far less intensively, despite the economic importance of this genus of parasites. thus, homologs or orthologs of several classes of proteases found in p. falciparum and/or t. gondii have also been identified in eimeria species including an aspartyl protease  <cit> , an aminopeptidase  <cit> , a rhomboid protease  <cit> , a subtilisin 2-like protease  <cit> , three cathepsin cs  <cit> , a cathepsin l  <cit>  and an orthologue of toxopain, a cathepsin b cysteine protease  <cit> . as for p. falciparum and t. gondii, these proteases have been found in the asexual stages of eimeria and are mostly predicted to play roles in host cell invasion, though expression of some of these enzymes is associated with the sporulation of the developing oocyst  <cit> . however, it is hypothesized that proteolytic processing of two proteins from the wall forming bodies of the macrogametocytes of eimeria – gam <dig> and gam <dig> – is essential for the subsequent incorporation of tyrosine-rich peptides into the oocyst wall  <cit> .

in this study, we screened the e. tenella genomic database for genes encoding proteases, classified these into clans and families and designed pcr probes for them. using cdna produced from e. tenella stage specific mrna, we carried out semi-quantitative pcr to determine the stage specificity of expression of the protease genes, especially to identify protease mrnas that were upregulated in gametocytes. in order to further resolve which of these may be involved in oocyst wall formation, we carried out a processing assay using gametocyte extracts of e. tenella, whereby a variety of specific protease inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit the processing of gam <dig> into smaller, putative oocyst wall proteins.

RESULTS
identification of potential protease genes in eimeria tenella
the genome of e. tenella  was sequenced by the parasite genomics group at the wellcome trust sanger institute and provided pre-publication for the current analysis. the parasite genomics group plan to publish the annotated sequence in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming future. the e. tenella genome database  was explored to identify genes that were automatically predicted to code for aspartic, cysteine, metallo and serine proteases. database mining revealed over  <dig> gene sequences whose predicted open reading frames were associated with potential peptidase activity. manual annotation of the genes was performed by blast search of apicomplexan genome databases to identify phylogenetically closely related nucleotide sequences and by blast search of various protein databases to identify the most closely related, experimentally characterized homologs available . additionally, the predicted proteins were analysed for conserved motifs and domains to further validate protein function . each predicted protein was then assigned a five-tiered level of confidence for function using an evidence rating  system . the evidence rating system, described previously  <cit> , allocates genes an overall score , indicating how compelling the bioinformatic and experimental evidence is for protein function. an er <dig> rating signifies extremely reliable experimental data to support protein function in the particular species being investigated, in this case eimeria, whereas er <dig> indicates no experimental or bioinformatic evidence for gene function. genes with an er <dig> were eliminated from further investigation. after this validation process was performed,  <dig> putative protease genes remained and these could be classified into clans and families of aspartic, cysteine, metallo and serine proteases , including: three aspartic proteases, all within family a <dig> in clan aa;  <dig> cysteine proteases, the vast majority  of which were in clan ca, five being cathepsins , one calpain , eight ubiquitinyl hydrolases  and one otu protease , as well as a single clan cf pyroglutamyl peptidase ;  <dig> metallo proteases, distributed over five clans , me , mf , mk  and mm ) and seven families , m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig> , m <dig>  and m <dig> ); and  <dig> serine proteases in clan pa , clan sb , clan sc , clan sk  and clan st . three additional rhomboid proteases were identified in the e. tenella genome database by using blastp to search the database using, as queries, homologs described in t. gondii: rhomboid protease  <dig> ; rhomboid protease  <dig> ; and rhomboid protease  <dig> . however, we were unable to confirm coding sequences or stage-specific expression for any of these three genes.

the e. tenella genome database  was searched for genes predicted to code for proteins with peptidase activity. all auto-annotated peptidase genes identified were manually curated by performing blast analysis against apicomplexan genome sequence databases and various protein databases  <cit>  such as the protein data bank , swiss-prot and non-redundant . in addition, signature protein motifs for the protein sequence of each gene were identified through pfam , interproscan  and the merops databases . further gene sequence manipulations, such as translation into amino acid sequences and clustalw alignments, were performed using the dnastar lasergene™  <dig> core suite. genes were assigned a five-tiered level of confidence for gene function using an evidence rating  system giving an overall score of er1- <dig>  where er <dig> indicates extremely reliable experimental data to support function and er <dig> indicates no evidence for gene function  <cit> .

stage-specific protease gene expression
to assess the stage specific gene expression of putative proteases identified in the e. tenella database, different stages of the parasite lifecycle were isolated and total rna purified. these stages included merozoites,  <dig> h gametocytes, unsporulated oocysts, sporulated oocysts as well as uninfected caeca control tissue. rt-pcr was performed and the stage-specific cdna samples were subjected to control pcrs to determine purity . purification of merozoite and gametocyte lifecycle stages inevitably results in co-purification of host tissue, hence, the e. tenella β-actin structural gene was amplified to optimize relative amounts of parasite starting material as described previously  <cit> . the e. tenella β-actin gene was amplified from each of the parasite lifecycle cdna samples and quantification of bands visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis allowed the specific e. tenella cdna to be standardized to each other accordingly. the e. tenella gam <dig> gene product, which is predominantly expressed in gametocytes but largely down-regulated in unsporulated oocysts, confirmed the quality of gametocyte cdna and served as a gametocyte-specific positive control, establishing the lack of gametocytes in merozoite and oocyst samples. the amplification of the tfp <dig> gene, specifically expressed in the asexual stages  <cit> , indicated contaminating merozoite cdna in the gametocyte cdna sample, as anticipated, at the 134 h time point. furthermore, amplification of a chicken host-specific lysozyme gene indicated host cdna was present in both merozoite and gametocyte preparations, also as anticipated.

after optimisation of parasite lifecycle stage cdna samples, primer pairs were designed to generate pcr products from exons of less than 1 kb in size, where possible. pcrs were performed at optimal annealing temperatures specific for the individual primer pairs and annealing times optimal for predicted cdna sized products. pcrs were performed at least twice  for each gene product, by different researchers each time. in the case of failed pcrs, primer pairs were redesigned and retested. results of pcr on the different lifecycle stages of e. tenella indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> protease genes could be amplified from parasite cdna . the five pcrs that failed to amplify a product from cdna were for three of the eight ubiquitinyl hydrolases, the single otu protease and one of the six subtilisins. however, it was possible to amplify pcr products from gdna for all five of these proteases that, when sequenced, confirmed primer specificity . the failure to amplify a product from cdna for these genes may be due to genome annotation problems; possibly the sequence targeted by our primers is not transcribed or falls in unpredicted intronic regions. alternatively, a low abundance of these transcripts may have contributed to the failure to detect cdna amplification products. further work will be required to characterize these genes. all other pcr products from cdna from the four e. tenella lifecycle stages were directly sequenced to confirm the correct coding sequence. expected and actual cdna amplicon sizes and their corresponding sequence accession numbers are shown in table  <dig>

the majority of the protease genes were expressed in more than one of the four parasite stages investigated . however, stage-specific up- or downregulation of protease gene expression was evident. thus, taking into account that merozoite cdna contaminates the gametocyte samples, it is safe to conclude that there were a large number  of protease genes whose expression was upregulated in merozoites including eimepsin  <dig>  cathepsin c <dig>  calpain, several of the ubiquitinyl hydrolases, an atp-dependent zn protease, the caax prenyl protease, three of the five insulysins, the leucyl aminopeptidase, the o-sialoglycoprotease, one of the trypsins, a subtilisin, the clp protease and rhomboid protease  <dig>  aminopeptidase n <dig> appeared to be downregulated specifically in merozoites. gametocyte-specific or gametocyte-upregulated proteases were also common, with thirteen in all, also distributed across the four groups of proteases, including eimepsin  <dig>  cathepsin c <dig>  ubiquitinyl hydrolase  <dig> and  <dig>  the pyroglutamyl peptidase, aminopeptidase n <dig>  insulysin  <dig>  the s2p-like metalloprotease, two trypsin-like proteases and three of the subtilisins. additionally, two other proteases were upregulated or specific for the sexual phase of the lifecycle , namely, cathepsin c <dig> and subtilisin  <dig>  cathepsin l appeared to be downregulated specifically in gametocytes. only two protease genes, a pepsin-like protease with high homology to eimepsin  and an insulysin, were switched on exclusively in oocyst lifecycle stages. in contrast, numerous protease genes appeared to be downregulated in sporulated oocysts .

protease processing of gam56
gametocytes from e. tenella-infected caeca were lysed and immediately incubated with or without protease inhibitors for various lengths of time, and the native gam <dig> protein analysed by sds-page and western blotting with anti-gam <dig> antibodies, as described previously  <cit> , to track the disappearance of the protein to determine whether any inhibitors could prevent the degradation observed in the presence of native gametocyte proteases. the precise epitopes recognised by the anti-gam <dig> polyclonal antibodies are not known for e. tenella though there is some evidence, from work with e. maxima <cit> , that they are located in the conserved amino-terminus of the protein. the anti-gam <dig> antibodies are, thus, very useful for sensitive and specific tracking of the degradation of gam <dig>  no disappearance of gam <dig> was apparent after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h  but was obvious at 24h . the  <dig> h assay was therefore repeated three times with a comprehensive range of protease inhibitors  targeting the four protease families identified in the genome. the aspartyl protease inhibitor, pepstatin a, had no effect on gam <dig> disappearance . none of three cysteine protease inhibitors investigated, z-phe-ala-diazomethylketone , n-ethylmalemide  or e <dig>  inhibited gam <dig> disappearance. the serine/cysteine protease inhibitor, chymostatin  and leupeptin , inhibited gam <dig> disappearance but another inhibitor with the same specificity, antipain, did not . the serine protease specific inhibitors, benzamidine hcl , soybean trypsin inhibitor  and aprotinin  all inhibited the disappearance of gam <dig> but aebsf did not . the metal chelating agent, edta, also inhibited the disappearance of gam <dig> but more specific metalloprotease inhibitors, bestatin and phosphoramidon, did not .

discussion
mining of the e. tenella genome database has revealed over  <dig> protease transcripts distributed over  <dig> clans and  <dig> families of aspartic, cysteine, metallo and serine proteases. such diversity of proteases is not unusual, indeed it may be an underestimate of the true number of protease genes in this parasite since other apicomplexan parasites are known to possess substantially more protease genes ; thus, for example, there are at least  <dig> in cryposporidium parvum, more than  <dig> in p. falciparum and over  <dig> in t. gondii, though other apicomplexan parasites possess similar numbers of protease genes as e. tenella. eimeria tenella also has lower numbers of protease genes than protozoan parasites like leishmania, trypanosoma and trichomonas . but, again, e. tenella has a broadly similar total number of protease genes to entamoeba dispar and giardia intestinalis, which are also intestinal parasites. however, the fact that our dataset for e. tenella lacks protease genes for several families, across all four types of proteases, that are represented in all other apicomplexa and most other protozoan parasites, including a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  provides reason to believe that some e. tenella protease genes remain unannotated.

the apparent stage-specific regulation of protease genes in e. tenella is striking and intriguing. most investigations of parasitic protozoan proteases have focused on the asexual stages of the apicomplexan parasites, t. gondii and p. falciparum, establishing crucial roles for proteases in host cell invasion, remodelling and egress by the asexual stages of these parasites  <cit> . our finding that expression of up to  <dig> of  <dig> protease genes examined in e. tenella is upregulated in merozoites further underscores the importance of proteases in the biology of the asexual stages of apicomplexan parasites. not surprisingly, therefore, an eimepsin, several cathepsins, a calpain, a trypsin-like protease, subtilisins, clp and a rhomboid protease are upregulated in the asexual stages of e. tenella . likewise, eimepsin <dig> and insulysin  <dig> are expressed specifically in oocysts and may play an important role in the first steps of the parasite lifecycle, such as host cell invasion; they are, therefore, worthy of further research. the downregulation of several proteases  in sporulated oocysts may be, in part, attributed to the dormancy of this lifecycle stage, yet still warrants further investigation.

perhaps the most significant finding of our stage-specific expression study was the relatively large number of protease genes whose expression is upregulated specifically in the gametocytes stage – a total of at least  <dig> genes, including six that are only expressed in gametocyte . this observation becomes even more intriguing when examined in the context of the distribution of different families of proteases across parasitic protozoa . four classes of proteases stand out amongst the protozoa because they are only found, or are “over-represented” in the two coccidian parasites, e. tenella and t. gondii – families c <dig>  m <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  eimeria tenella contains a total of eleven protease genes distributed unevenly across these families, with only one in c <dig> and m <dig> and three and six in the serine protease families, s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively. but, even more significantly, all but three of these unique protease genes are upregulated or confined in expression to the gametocyte stage of the parasite. thus, expression of a pyroglutamyl peptidase, a trypsin-like protease and subtilisin  <dig> is upregulated in gametocytes whilst expression of an sp2-like protease, a trypsin 1-like protease and three subtilisins is entirely gametocyte specific.

one of the defining features of the coccidia is the possession of a hard-walled oocyst that originates from specialized organelles  in macrogametocytes. it is hypothesized  <cit>  that degradation of two proteins found in the wall forming bodies of macrogametocytes of eimeria, namely gam <dig> and gam <dig>  is integral to oocyst wall formation; tyrosine-rich peptides formed by the degradation of these two proteins are believed to be subsequently cross-linked via dityrosine bonds  <cit> , giving the oocyst wall its renowned strength and resistance to environmental and chemical insults  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we designed an assay to follow the degradation of gam <dig> in freshly harvested gametocytes . this assay has certain inherent limitations: first, it relies on sensitive antibodies for detection of specific degradation of gam <dig> and, unfortunately, the lack of suitable antibodies for detection of gam <dig> in e. tenella <cit>  meant that we were unable to run confirmatory experiments with this protein; and, second, the only controls possible are a zero time point and a cocktail of protease inhibitors designed to prevent all proteolytic activity. these limitations require us to be cautious in our interpretations; none-the-less, the inhibition of degradation of native gam <dig> by a very specific group of protease inhibitors reveals that this function may be carried out by subtilisin-like proteases. thus, degradation of gam <dig> was inhibited by the serine/cysteine protease inhibitors, chymostatin and leupeptin, and the serine protease specific inhibitors, benzamidine hcl, soybean trypsin inhibitor and aprotinin but not by aebsf . intriguingly, the metal chelating agent, edta, also inhibited degradation of gam <dig>  this profile indicates that serine proteases are critical for degradation of gam <dig> but it seems to rule out participation of rhomboid proteases, which are unaffected by edta, aprotonin, leupeptin and chymostatin  <cit> . trypsin-like proteases can, perhaps, not be completely ruled out of this process but the inhibitory profile, particularly the lack of inhibition by aebsf coupled with the inhibitory effect of edta, points to a subtilisin or subtilisins as p. falciparum subtilisin  <dig> is inhibited in exactly the same fashion  <cit> .

subtilisins are further implicated in the formation of the oocyst wall of eimeria through analogy with their known role in the formation of the cuticle of nematodes. thus, the assembly of collagens to form the cuticle involves a number of molecular events that strikingly resemble our model of oocyst wall formation pathways: first, collagens are the result of degradation of proproteins by a subtilisin-like protease  <cit> ; and, second, these collagens are subsequently bonded together by di- and tri-tyrosine crosslinks  <cit> . a failure in either of these steps, results in a malformed cuticle and parasite death  <cit> . subtilisins are currently being further investigated as potential candidates in the catalytic cleavage of the oocyst wall precursor proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
eimeria tenella possesses a large number of genes coding for proteolytic enzymes, which display a remarkable pattern of stage specific expression. as in other apicomplexan parasites such as p. falciparum and t. gondii, expression of many of these genes is upregulated in the asexual, invasive stages, possibly indicating important roles in host cell invasion, remodelling and egress. however, expression of almost one-third of the protease genes identified in the e. tenella genome is upregulated or confined to the sexual gametocyte stage of this parasite’s lifecycle; some of these appear to be unique to coccidia and may play key roles in the formation of the resilient oocyst wall, a defining feature of this group of important parasites.
