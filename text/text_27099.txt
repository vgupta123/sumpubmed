BACKGROUND
sunflower  is one of the most important sources of vegetable oil grown worldwide  <cit> . fungal infections represent one of the main constraints for crop yield and productivity, having a detrimental impact on quality components. sclerotinia sclerotiorum  de bary is a worldwide distributed necrotrophic pathogen, attacking more than  <dig> plant species including sunflower, soybean and rapeseed  <cit> . the fungus can attack several plant organs causing diverse symptoms in leaves, stalks and flowers, with sclerotinia head rot  being the most damaging for sunflower crop production. shr is considered a major disease in europe, argentina, and usa, causing average yield reductions of  <dig> to 20 %, and can even result in loss of the entire harvest  <cit> . disease control on s. sclerotiorum is difficult, since the fungus persists in soils for long periods and at high inoculum levels  <cit> .

resistance to s. sclerotiorum has been described as quantitatively inherited with predominantly additive gene action, and medium heritability  <cit> . classical linkage mapping based on biparental populations was used to dissect quantitative trait loci  for shr resistance. these analyses have rendered qtl with small effects, explaining only a minor proportion of the phenotypic variance  <cit> . in addition, a number of studies have been done in other s. sclerotiorum host species to understand the defense mechanisms triggered in resistant genotypes  <cit> . one of the most comprehensive studies has been conducted in brassica napus by performing microarray analysis in resistant and susceptible genotypes infected with s. sclerotiorum <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig>  genes were found to be differentially expressed after infection in the resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. the number of differentially expressed genes increased over infection time, most of them being up-regulated. the putative functions of these genes included pathogenesis related proteins, proteins involved in oxidative burst, protein kinase and molecule transporters, among others  <cit> . however, extrapolating this information to sunflower, and using it to evaluate new sources of resistance requires the identification of orthologous genes between b. napus and h. annuus.

association mapping  was suggested as a promising alternative to classical linkage mapping to elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits  <cit> . the am approach is based on the extent of linkage disequilibrium  observed in a set of accessions that are not closely related. in contrast to classical biparental population mapping, am is a method that detects relationships between phenotypic variation and gene polymorphisms in existing germplasm, without development of mapping populations. this method incorporates the effects of recombination occurring in many past generations into a single analysis and thus, it is complementary to the classical biparental approach  <cit> . the main drawback of am is the possibility of false-positive results due to unrecognized population structure. in order to avoid population stratification effects, information on the relatedness among genotypes is commonly included trough the recognition of the population structure and/or as a kinship matrix between genotypes  <cit> .

am has been successfully applied in mapping genes involved in several traits in different plant species   <cit> . even though two possible strategies have been proposed, genome wide association  and candidate gene approaches, the latter has been the most widely used in plants, mostly due to the lack of complete genome data for many plant species.

despite the fact that both nucleotide diversity and decay of ld have been assessed in sunflower germplasm from different origins  <cit> , no am studies have been published to date either for shr or any other trait.

this paper reports the identification of resistance qtl for shr based on candidate gene am. given that no biological mechanisms or biochemical pathways have been positively identified for shr, selection of candidate genes was based on previous transcript profiling studies in sunflower  <cit>  and b. napus <cit> . this approach resulted successful in detecting a significant association between one of the candidate genes evaluated and shr incidence. these results suggest that am is a useful strategy for dissecting complex traits in sunflower, thus providing a valuable tool to assist in crop breeding.

RESULTS
phenotypic data
ninety-four inbred lines belonging to the “sunflower breeding program” of inta were evaluated for shr incidence during 2008/ <dig> and 2009/ <dig> in replicated trials. because the experiments were conducted as randomized complete blocks, and repeated in two consecutive trials, the model used to obtain the adjusted line means, included the trial, and the blocks within trials, as random effects. all inoculation days were suitable to produce disease. the line effect was significant . the adjusted shr incidence means varied form 0 % to 100 %, with an average of  <dig>  %. in fact, 52 % of the association mapping population  showed an intermediate behavior against the disease, i.e. between 40 % and 60 % .

candidate gene selection
a total of  <dig> genes were used as starting point for candidate gene selection. putative orthologous sequences, either from sunflower or from other asteraceae species were identified for  <dig> out of  <dig> a. thaliana loci selected from the work of zhao et al.  <cit>  using the phylogenetic approach detailed in methods. after pcr amplification using sunflower genomic dna as template, products with the expected sequence were obtained for 10/ <dig> loci. for six of them, paralogous sequences were also identified in helianthus. thus, the initial  <dig> loci of a. thaliana correlated with  <dig> genes in sunflower  .

specific pcr products were obtained for 11/ <dig> genes selected from the rha <dig> est library . conversely, pcr amplification of ha26sps, hatf <dig> and haltp <dig> yielded unspecific products, whereas little or no amplification was observed for hathi, hate, hapk. introns of variable length  were found for harnahe, hahp <dig>  hakiv, hapep and hatf <dig> 

five germin-like proteins  and two transcription factors from the wrky family  were amplified successfully. summarizing, a total of  <dig> candidate genes were suitable for amplification in the  <dig> sunflower inbred lines selected as core set  for initial polymorphism development. the candidates encompassed  <dig> genes derived from the expression analysis of zhao et al.  <cit> , six genes from the rha <dig> est library  <cit>  and seven genes chosen based on their putative role in defense mechanisms in sunflower  <cit>  .

snp identification and genotyping of candidate genes
polymorphisms were found in 28/ <dig> candidate genes, and  <dig> were further selected to be genotyped in the amp. the seven genes that were not included in subsequent analyses were discarded due to  minor allele frequencies lower than  <dig>  in the cs ,  failure of dna sequencing in some members of the cs  and  the instability of polymorphic sites . genes hadrp, hacp, haglp <dig>  haglp <dig> and haglp <dig>  selected to be genotyped by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography  in the amp, did not achieve the expected resolution and were also excluded from further analyses. hence, 16/ <dig> polymorphic candidate genes were genotyped in the amp. three candidate genes were genotyped by dhplc , nine by fluorescent capillary electrophoresis   and four were typified by direct sequencing  . haplotypes not present in the cs were found in the amp for hacyp450c, happ2c, haric_b, hahp <dig>  hazfhd, hagdpdi and hawrky <dig>  regarding the  <dig> candidate genes genotyped in the amp, the number of haplotypes ranged from two to nine, with an average of  <dig>  haplotypes per gene. the average haplotype frequency was  <dig>  %. the lowest haplotype frequency  was found for hacyp450c and hawrky <dig>  whereas the highest haplotype frequency  was found for hapi gene.

population structure
the amp was characterized using eight ssrs, resulting in the detection of  <dig> alleles, ranging from four alleles at locus ha <dig> to nine at locus ha <dig> .

population structure was evaluated through principal coordinate analysis  and the bayesian method implemented in structure software  <cit> . the first two principal coordinates of the pco explained  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the molecular variance, with no clear clustering of individuals being detected among the  <dig> inbred lines analyzed . according to the structure analysis, the log-likelihood values of the data conditional on k reached a plateau at k =  <dig> . likewise, the ad hoc procedure proposed by evanno et al.  <cit>  showed peaks of Δk at k =  <dig>  k =  <dig> and k =  <dig>  thus, k =  <dig> was selected as the most likely number of ideal populations, since its signal was detected by both the log-likelihood and the evanno et al. criteria  <cit> . although most of the inbred lines  showed an inferred ancestry higher than 60 % to one of the k =  <dig> ideal populations, the other 38 % of individuals showed substantial admixture .

association analysis
the mlm accounts for multiple levels of relatedness, including population structure  and kinship relationships . the k matrix was calculated following bernardo  <cit> , as kijt=sij−11−t+ <dig>  the t parameter represents the probability that two alleles are alike in state, given that they are not identical by descent. in practice, t is unknown, and should be assessed, usually, by a maximum likelihood estimation procedure. however, despite several t values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  were empirically tested to evaluate its effect on results, the latter were unaffected by changes of t. the p-values of the association analysis using either the p matrix  or the q matrix  and two t values for the kinship matrix were found to be highly stable . a significant association was found between haric_b and shr incidence , with the maximum family wise error rate being below 14 % for the number of genes analyzed and a significance level of  <dig> .

kinship relationships were obtained as suggested by bernardo  <cit> . the k matrix was calculated as kijt=sij−11−t+ <dig> , where t is the probability that two alleles are alike in state, given that they are not identical by descent. in practice, t is unknown, but different t values  were evaluated to reach the maximum likelihood in model  explained in methods section. **p <  <dig> .

in order to identify which haplotype was involved in the association detected, the averages of the shr incidence adjusted means were plotted against the three different haplotypes found in haric_b . the haplotype  <dig> is associated with the lowest levels of shr incidence and is present in four inbred lines , which showed shr incidence of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. the effect of haplotype  <dig> was estimated as an incidence reduction of 19 % relative to the average incidence estimated for the whole set of inbred lines involved in the experiment.

haric_b pcr amplification using genomic dna from inbred lines carrying haplotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> yielded products of different lengths. haplotype  <dig> generated the shortest pcr product , haplotype  <dig> produced an intermediate length fragment correlating with a 10 bp insertion present in the first intron , and haplotype  <dig> amplified the longest pcr product . haric_b was also analyzed at the cdna level to investigate its gene structure in sunflower. according to this analysis, haric_b genomic structure consists of four exons and three introns . haplotype  <dig> and  <dig> did not show length variation at the cdna level. the length difference between haplotype 1/ <dig> and  <dig> corresponds to a 311-bp insertion located 31 bp before the end of exon two and to a 5-bp indel detected in the third intron . the 311-bp insertion leads to the splicing of exon two and to a shorter rt-pcr product . at the protein level, this splicing pattern causes a frame-shift which results in a premature stop codon . accumulation of haric_b transcripts was examined by rt-pcr in different organs and capitula developmental stages  of inbred lines carrying haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. haric_b is accumulated specifically in florets, in contrast to the housekeeping gene, which was found in all the tested tissues .

discussion
the genetic determinants of shr resistance were investigated following a candidate gene approach intended to provide fine-scale resolution to qtl mapping efforts for this trait. selection of candidate genes is one of the fundamental challenges of candidate gene am, particularly when there is limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying the trait under study. for shr, the most comprehensive experimental evidence comes from the study of gene expression changes in two genotypes of the oilseed b. napus infected with s. sclerotiourum using a whole genome microarray from a. thaliana <cit> . however, transferring this information to sunflower was hindered by ortholog identification between highly divergent species. commonly, most researchers use pairwise distance comparisons algorithms, such as blast, cog , rbh , rsd  and inparanoid, to determine gene orthology  <cit> . in contrast, although they have been shown to exhibit greater accuracy and lower error rates than pairwise comparison methods, phylogeny based approaches have been only partially exploited due to the complexity of the automation of sequence alignment and the choice of appropriate genes and species to be included in the analysis  <cit> . notwithstanding, it is only by phylogenetic reconstruction that ortholog and parolog relationships can be distinguished, especially for species with incomplete genome sequence data where the best hit of pairwise comparison methods is often not the nearest neighbor  <cit> .

the phylogenetic approach devised here allowed identification of  <dig> genes from asteraceae that are orthologs or paralogs to the a. thaliana loci detected as over-expressed at  <dig> hpi in the b. napus resistant genotype. particularly, for at5g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  two to three loci were identified as paralogs to the a. thaliana sequence used as query, providing wider coverage of their putative functional spectrum .

two additional sources served to increase to  <dig> the number of candidate genes, an est library obtained through suppressive subtractive hybridization from sunflower capitula of the genotype rha <dig> infected with s. sclerotiorum at  <dig> hpi, and previous literature reports  <cit> . after identification of polymorphisms  within the core set of  <dig> inbred lines, a total of  <dig> candidate genes were selected to be further genotyped in the amp. this number of candidate genes has proved adequate to find significant genotype-phenotype associations for traits with different degrees of complexity. examples include the studies carried out in a. thaliana for flowering time  <cit> , in potato for late blight  <cit>  and in maize for aluminum tolerance  <cit> . moreover, in this study the authors used information sources similar to those described here to select the candidate genes, finding significant associations for six of them.

the amp analyzed here is representative of the elite breeding pool used by inta in the “sunflower breeding program”. it encompasses germplasm from different geographical origins, with some of the lines being derived from introgressions with wild helianthus species . in agreement with the morphological diversity and intricate ancestry of the amp, the ssr markers revealed high levels of genetic variability. indeed, the mean number of alleles per locus was even higher than the estimate obtained for a set of compounds, populations and lines conserved at the inta germplasm bank   <cit> .

as suggested by stich et al.  <cit> , marker-trait associations were assessed using mlm, which took into account trials, blocks, population structure and kinship relationships to control type i error rates. both pco and the bayesian method  were used to infer population structure for the  <dig> elite inbred lines. while pco analysis showed no clear grouping pattern by drawing the two first principal coordinates, structure suggested the presence of nine different gene pools . the lack of defined groups in pco is not unexpected given the restricted genetic of cultivated sunflower  <cit> . however, either using p or q matrixes in the association analysis did not have an impact on the p-values . moreover, varying the probability t for the calculation of the k matrix did not modify the association results.

a significant association was detected between a lower srh incidence and the haplotype  <dig> of haric_b . the nature of the mutation found in the haplotype  <dig> of haric_b, the highly specific expression pattern for this gene in sunflower and the experimental evidence on the role of this protein family in a. thaliana <cit>  lend support to the biological significance of the detected association. haric_b was selected from the study of zhao et al.  <cit>  following ortholog identification via phylogenetic analysis. haplotype  <dig> showed an insertion of 311-bp at the 3’ end of exon two, which alters the rna splicing and, consequently, leads to both the generation of a frame-shift and a premature stop codon in the mrna. only ca. 15 % of mutations that have been identified as being associated with genetic variation in plant quantitative traits involve changes in the amino acid composition of proteins. however, it has been shown that many of the associations that correspond to noncoding mutations located in introns, untranslated regions or intergenic regions show up as significant because they are in ld with untyped causal mutations that in turn are nonsynonymous substitutions  <cit> .

although haric_b molecular function has been inferred by homology, the orthologous a. thaliana gene  has been experimentally described as a small binding-protein that interacts with rop <dig> . there are  <dig> arabidopsis ric proteins  involved in pollen tube growth and other functions  <cit> . wu et al.  <cit>  have shown that ric <dig> transcripts are found only in the flowers and inflorescences of a. thaliana. in agreement with its proposed ortholog relationship, the expression pattern of haric_b matches that found for ric <dig>  with transcripts being present in florets from r <dig> to r <dig> developmental stage . it is noteworthy that r <dig>  is the period of maximum susceptibility to s. sclerotiorum infection in the sunflower cultivation areas of south america, and florets are the main entry point for the pathogen  <cit> .

different studies suggest that the role of ric <dig> involves elevation of cytosolic ca2+ and regulation of  de-polymerization of actin filaments,  exo-cytosis, and  ca2+ mediated signals  <cit> . interestingly, the rop-interactive domain of haric_b is located in exon two, which is missing in plants carrying haplotype  <dig>  thus, if a functional protein can be synthesized from it, its regulation by rop gtpases would seemingly be not possible.

recently, two necrosis and ethylene-induced peptides  have been described in s. sclerotiorum . ssnep <dig> expression is highly dependent on ca2+ concentration, and compounds increasing calcium levels  greatly reduced s. sclerotiorum virulence and expression of ssnep <dig> <cit> . thus, consistent with its putative role of intracellular calcium elevation, the haplotype  <dig> of haric_b might be participating in the defense against shr by repressing expression of the necrosis factor ssnep <dig>  through the de-regulation and elevation of cytosolic ca2+ concentrations in the target organ for pathogen attack.

the power of association mapping greatly depends not only on the allele frequency distribution but also on the magnitude of the effect that can be ascribed to a locus, relative to other loci present in the population  <cit> . thus, the detection of association between haric_b  and a lower shr incidence, despite the fact that haplotype  <dig> was in low frequency, suggests that it has a strong effect on the phenotype. indeed, considering that resistance is the result of the interaction of multiple factors, having found a single haplotype that accounts for a shr incidence reduction of about 20 % in average, emphasizes the importance of the finding. however, beyond the experimental evidence presented here, and the biological considerations that support the role of haplotype  <dig> on the resistance to shr, validation of these results will require the re-evaluation of this candidate polymorphism in a larger amp and different field testing environments. a wider association study is currently underway using large-scale gene sampling and high-throughput genotyping methods.

it has been shown that the causal polymorphism for a qtl can be distant from the functional gene under analysis, particularly in species with high levels of ld, such as sunflower  <cit> . while it cannot be ruled out that the polymorphism responsible for a lower shr incidence resides in a linked ungenotyped region, the evidences discussed here suggest that haric_b can be considered a strong candidate to be directly involved in shr resistance. to assess its relationships with qtl previously identified in biparental populations, haric_b was genotyped in the sunflower ril mapping population pac <dig> x rha <dig>  it was mapped to lg <dig> between the markers e36m59_ <dig> and e38m50_ <dig> , a region for which no qtl have been reported to date  <cit> . this is not unexpected, as the parental lines used to investigate shr resistance may not carry the haplotype  <dig> of haric_b, especially considering its low frequency in the amp. in this context, haric_b may be thought of as a new and highly delimited qtl for shr resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
identification of genes and alleles underlying resistance to shr has been a major concern for sunflower research groups. the present work contributes to previous qtl studies by identifying the most highly delimited qtl for shr reported to date. validation experiments are currently ongoing to determine the specific role of haric_b, however, the association found is highly supported by  its specific expression pattern in the target organs of s. sclerotiorum infection,  the role of its orthologous gene in arabidopsis in altering cytosolic ca2+ concentration,  the fact that ca2+ plays an important part in reducing s. sclerotiorum virulence. finally, our results demonstrate that association genetics via candidate genes is a valuable approach for elucidating the molecular basis of complex agronomic traits in sunflower, and for developing dna-based markers for “precision breeding” of improved varieties.
