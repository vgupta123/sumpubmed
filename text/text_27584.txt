BACKGROUND
rna interference , a method of sequence specific gene knockdown, has been used to analyse gene function in plants, invertebrates, and more recently mammalian cells  <cit> . the conserved rnai pathway involves the processing of double stranded rna  duplexes into 21– <dig> nucleotide  molecules known as small interfering rnas  to initiate gene knockdown  <cit> . since the discovery of rnai in animals  <cit>  the use of long dsrna in lower eukaryotes, especially in the model organism caenorhabditis elegans, has been used to determine gene function  <cit> . however, in mammalian systems the cellular uptake of long dsrna induces an antiviral defence mechanism initiated by interferon , leading to non-specific translational shutdown and apoptosis  <cit> .

this non-specific cellular activity can be circumvented by the direct transfection of either chemically synthesised or in vitro transcribed sirnas of approximately  <dig> nt in length into mammalian cells  <cit> . these short molecules do not activate the ifn response, but can induce reliable and efficient transient knockdown of target genes  <cit> . as a consequence, the development of dna-based vectors for expression of short hairpin rna  molecules that are processed within the cell to produce active sirna molecules has progressed rapidly  <cit> . such dna expression constructs have achieved highly efficient gene knockdown without induction of the ifn response.

dna-based vectors offer some additional advantages over chemical and in vitro synthesised sirna. vector construction is much less expensive compared to the chemical synthesis of sirna, selection of transfected cells is possible via antibiotic selection and the option of inducible shrna transcription is also available. shrna expression vectors have been engineered using both viral , and plasmid systems  <cit> . these vectors often utilize promoters from a small class of pol. iii promoters  <cit>  to drive the expression of shrna. promoters of this type are preferred because they naturally direct the synthesis of small, highly abundant non-coding rna transcripts, with defined termination sequences consisting of 4– <dig> thymidines  and have no requirement for downstream promoter elements  <cit> .

the human u <dig> snrna promoter is the best studied type iii pol. iii promoter. it has characteristic promoter elements known as the enhancer and core regions  <cit> , and is frequently used in rnai expression vectors. a total of nine full-length u <dig> loci have been identified from the human genome  <cit> . these genes are dispersed throughout the genome and five of these are potentially active, including the previously described human u <dig> promoter, now denoted u6- <dig>  in the current study we describe the characterisation of the bovine u <dig> snrna promoter and its expression of shrna molecules in bovine cells. we used a pcr based cloning strategy to construct a plasmid vector that features the bovine u <dig> promoter to drive expression of shrna molecules directed at the exogenously expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein  and the endogenous bovine gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase .

RESULTS
characterisation of a bovine u <dig> promoter
a bovine bac clone was identified from genbank  that contained a  <dig> nt region that shared 100% identity with the human u <dig> snrna sequence. a region directly upstream of this sequence also shared significant homology with previously identified human u <dig> promoter sequences. blat analysis revealed that this bac-clone shared the greatest sequence homology with the human u6- <dig> promoter located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the bovine bac sequence contained upstream promoter elements consistent with the human u <dig> promoters and other human pol. iii promoters  <cit>  . these elements are also present in the mouse u <dig> promoter used in the psilencer  <dig> -u <dig> sirna expression vector . the location and spacing of these elements is similar for all human u <dig> promoters and their requirement for pol. iii activity is well documented  <cit> . the presence of these elements in the bovine bac-clone sequence directly upstream of the full-length u <dig> snrna suggested that this region may be an active bovine promoter and could be used effectively to promote shrna expression.

shrna expression vector construction
using the predicted bovine u <dig> snrna promoter sequence as template, pcr based cloning strategies were used to generate shrna expression vectors targeting egfp and bovine gapdh. a two-step pcr reaction was used to produce a vector targeting egfp  . one-step pcr reactions were used to produce an shrna expression vector targeting gapdh , and a non-specific control shrna  . in addition, using the mouse u <dig> snrna promoter sequence from psilencer- <dig>  as template in one-step pcr reactions, shrna expression vectors targeting egfp  and bovine gapdh  were produced .

in all constructs, the first nucleotide of the predicted shrna was a guanine  residue, corresponding to the first nucleotide of the native u <dig> snrna. an xbai restriction enzyme site was engineered downstream of the termination signal to allow screening for full-length shrna products inserted into pgem-t easy  which lacks an xbai site. all final shrna expression constructs consisted of either the full-length bovine or mouse u <dig> promoter, a shrna sense sequence, a loop sequence, a shrna antisense sequence, a termination sequence and an xbai site.

activity of the bovine u <dig> promoter measured by egfp knockdown
to analyse the function of the bovine u <dig> promoter, the level of egfp expression in cells cotransfected with pbovineu6-shegfp and pegfp-n <dig>  were directly compared with egfp expression in cells cotransfected with pbovineu6-shscrambled and pegfp-n <dig>  an indication of the bovine promoter efficiency was provided by direct comparison to the level of egfp knockdown by the same shrna molecule expressed from pmouseu6-shegfp. prior to validation in bovine cells, both mouse and bovine u <dig> promoter driven shrna expression vectors were first validated in vero cells. as this cell line lacks the interferon α, β and ω genes  <cit> , a significant reduction in egfp expression could be attributed to rnai and not the result of non-specific inhibition of protein translation characteristic of the ifn response triggered by expressed exogenous dsrna.

for each transfection condition, knockdown of egfp in vero and mdbk cell lines was visualised by fluorescence microscopy . flow cytometry was used to determine the mean fluorescence intensity  . results in both cell lines showed that cells transfected with either pmouseu6-shegfp or pbovineu6-shegfp exhibited large reductions in egfp expression when compared with cells transfected with pbovineu6-shscrambled.

to ensure that the observed reduction in egfp expression could be directly attributed to rnai induced by expressed shrna, the transcription of these molecules was detected in transfected cells. a radiolabelled rna probe complementary in sequence to the egfp shrna sequence was used in an rnase protection assay to visualise these molecules. the mouse microrna  mir- <dig> probe used as a loading control for each condition produced a strong signal at the expected size for all samples . the egfp shrna was detected only in those samples that were transfected with either of the egfp shrna vectors . there were no obvious differences in the amount of shrna produced by either the mouse or bovine u <dig> promoters.

activity of the bovine u <dig> promoter measured by gapdh knockdown
to further validate the function of the bovine u <dig> promoter for rnai, shrna expression vectors targeting the endogenous bovine gene gapdh were produced. an active shrna sequence was identified by testing three sirna sequences directed at this gene. real-time pcr was used to determine the relative amount of gapdh in mdbk cells transfected with the three sirnas compared to cells transfected with the scrambled sequence sirna control. a similar level of knockdown was achieved for each of the bovine gapdh sirnas . the most appropriate sirna sequence, gapdh # <dig>  was selected for use in construction of an shrna vector as this sequence did not contain any runs of t or a residues that may cause premature termination of expressed shrnas. this sequence was used for both mouse and bovine u <dig> shrna vectors . using real-time pcr, the relative amount of gapdh in mdbk cells transfected with pmouse-shgapdh and pbovine-shgapdh was determined by comparison to cells transfected with the irrelevant control plasmid pbovine-shscrambled . both vectors produced a very similar level of gapdh knockdown, although not as effective as the gapdh sirnas. this is probably because the transfection efficiency for sirnas is generally much greater than that of large plasmid vectors.

CONCLUSIONS
we mined data from the bovine sequencing project and identified a bovine u <dig> snrna promoter that is the putative bovine homologue of the human u6- <dig> snrna promoter. this pol. iii promoter sequence contains a number of functional sequence elements that are characteristic of this type of promoter and are essential for promoter function. the bovine u <dig> promoter sequence was used in the construction of plasmid based shrna expression vectors pbovineu6-shegfp and pbovineu6-shgapdh. these vectors efficiently induced rnai in mdbk and vero cells through production of shrna molecules targeted at the exogenously expressed reporter gene egfp, and the endogenous bovine gene gapdh. the use of this promoter sequence and the shrna vector cloning strategy described here will be advantageous in rnai functional genomic experiments in bovine cells. the characterisation of this u <dig> promoter is an important step in the development of novel bovine species specific rnai based therapeutics. for ethical reasons it is essential to minimise the introduction of non-bovine dna sequences, consequently this research could be of significance in the transgenic delivery of shrna molecules in bovine species.
