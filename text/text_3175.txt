BACKGROUND
genetic sequence variation within the mitochondrial genome  has by tradition been considered to represent accumulation under the neutral equilibrium model  <cit> . this view relied largely on the genetics of mtdna: it is haploid, maternally transmitted and non-recombining. there are relative few mtdna genes, but these encode fundamental biological processes  <cit>  and any functional variation in such genes should thus swiftly be purged or fixed by natural selection  <cit> . in recent times, however, a number of studies have shown that the pattern of mitochondrial dna variation and evolution is often at odds with a neutral model. evidence of positive selection has been observed in mtdna sequence data, for example in the form of high dn/ds ratios or correlations between haplotype frequencies and environmental factors . moreover, recent experimental studies that use crossing designs to isolate effects of mtdna have documented important phenotypic effects of mtdna variation . the maintenance of mtdna polymorphism, involving functionally non-equivalent haplotypes, may rely upon epistatic interactions between mtdna and the nuclear genome    <cit> .

processes that are governed by mtdna or hosted by mitochondria  are to a large extent dependent upon products of the nuclear genome and intergenomic mtdna × nudna epistasis should therefore be widespread  <cit> . mitonuclear interactions have been observed over several levels of biological organization; from interspecific to intraspecific  <cit> . generally, however, mitonuclear incompatibilities tend to increase with genetic distance  <cit> . theory predicts that adaptive mtdna mutations should fix rapidly within populations through positive selection in females  <cit>  and the nuclear genome should co-adapt as a corollary  <cit> , generating population differentiation. it is thus not surprising that many studies have documented mitonuclear interactions between populations while there are much fewer examples of such interactions within populations  <cit> . selection on joint mitonuclear genotypes can act to maintain variation in mtdna  <cit> , but the maintenance of stable mitonuclear polymorphisms within populations seems to require either sex-specific selection or frequency dependent selection . negative frequency dependent selection will occur whenever the relative fitness of a mtdna haplotype is, for whatever reason, inversely proportional to its frequency  <cit> . theory also show that sex specific selection, favoring different mitonuclear types in males and females, can act to maintain mitonuclear polymorphism  <cit> . because of the key role that sex-specific mitonuclear fitness interactions may play  <cit> , empirical tests of such sex-specific epistasis are much needed  <cit> .

experimental studies of mitonuclear fitness interactions within populations have yielded mixed results. some studies have found no evidence  <cit>  while others have  <cit> . for example, one study of sympatric cytoplasmic variation on viability in drosophila melanogaster failed to detect any nuclear-cytoplasmic effects, across second chromosome segregation lines  <cit> . however, another study of the same species  <cit>  revealed sizable nuclear-cytoplasmic effects, across lines carrying different x chromosomes. yet another study  <cit>  demonstrated sizable sympatric mitonuclear fitness interactions in d. melanogaster, but provided limited evidence for sex-specific fitness ranks of mitonuclear variants. also, studies of d. subobscura populations assessing linkage disequilibrium between nuclear markers such as chromosomal inversions or allozymes and mtdna variability, indicative of selection on mitonuclear genotypes  <cit> , found subtle and seemingly transient disequilibria . the possibility that negative frequency dependent selection, presumably generated by habitat heterogeneity, promotes mitonuclear polymorphisms recently received experimental support in a study that monitored changes in haplotype frequencies in  <dig> laboratory populations of the seed beetle callosobruchus maculatus  <cit> . here, the relative fitness of mtdna haplotypes over  <dig> generations of experimental evolution was inversely proportional to their starting frequency.

d. subobscura is an intriguing model system for the study of genetic variation in mtdna . the presence of ubiquitous intra-population variation, with two dominant haplotypes  co-occurring together with typically much rarer endemic haplotypes, in conjunction with weak differentiation between geographically distant populations makes d. subobscura an ideal system for understanding the forces that act to maintain within-population variation in mtdna. previous studies of natural populations have suggested that both random and adaptive processes are required to account for the observed temporal and geographic distribution of the two dominant haplotypes in this system. a number of studies are indicative of selection on mitonuclear genotypes, and experimental assessments have yielded some evidence for this  <cit> . here, we extend this work and ask whether the phenotypic effects of the two dominant haplotypes in d. subobscura are sex specific. to achieve this, we create and assay replicated mitonuclear introgression lines.

the construction of mitonuclear introgression lines , that harbor different combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear variants, can greatly aid our understanding of the forces that act within populations to maintain genetic variability in mtdna as it allows the dissection of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic effects on phenotypes  <cit> . here, we use mnils to examine  whether segregating genetic variation in mtdna within populations is functional,  whether phenotypic effects of mtdna interacts epistatically with segregating nudna variation and  whether such effects are sex-specific. we assess a series of key life-history traits independently in males and females. a recent study of the same set of mnils documented sizeable differences in metabolic rate between flies with different haplotypes, with partly sex-specific effects  <cit> . however, that study found no significant mitonuclear interactions for adult metabolic rate. in the current study, we provide a detailed dissection of mitochondrial and mitonuclear effects on fitness components such as egg-to-adult developmental time, viability, offspring sex-ratio, adult longevity and resistance to desiccation.

RESULTS
our crossing design was partially orthogonal, with some combinations of mtdna × nudna missing, and we thus analyzed our data using three different inferential modules . the first module  focused on differences in life history traits between haplotypes i and d, the second  on differences between ii and d, and the third  on differences between i and ii. we found no significant effects of mtdna, nudna or their interaction on overall egg-to-adult developmental time or egg-to-adult viability per replicate vial, in any of the three modules . there was a tendency for haplotype i to show shorter developmental time and higher viability compared to the other haplotypes , but this trend was not significant. the addition of vial-specific adult sex-ratio to these models in no case significantly improved model fit to data . it is possible that the lack of significant genetic effects on developmental time and viability may, at least in part, be due to laboratory adaptation during introgression.fig.  <dig> the crossing design used in the mitonuclear introgression experiment. indicated are also the three crossed modules used for inferential modelling

in terms of the proportion of males produced per vial  haplotype ii differed from the others, but mtdna haplotype effects depended critically upon the nudna background. haplotype ii showed a much lower proportion of males compared to the d haplotype in the native ii nudna background. in the d nudna background this effect was reversed, such that haplotype ii yielded more males than both haplotypes i and d. assuming that mtdna carries no meiotic drive elements  <cit> , such that the primary sex ratio is 1: <dig> in all lines, this data implies that female juvenile survival was somewhat elevated compared to that in males in flies carrying haplotype ii when coexpressed with its native nudna. there was also a nudna effect, such that flies carrying nudna originally associated with mtdna haplotype i showed a higher proportion of hatching males than those carrying nudna associated with the d haplotype. the addition of vial-specific viability to these models in no case significantly improved model fit to data . thus, the observed effects were not due to an overall effect of viability on the proportion of males eclosing.table  <dig> the effects of mitochondrial haplotype , nuclear genetic background  and their interaction on the proportion of males hatching

our analyses of adult survival  revealed a series of sex-specific effects. overall, females lived longer than males did and females were more resistant to desiccation, but the strength of the sex effect on longevity was contingent upon the mitonuclear genotype as evidenced by the sex × mtdna × nudna interactions in modules a and b. interestingly, the effects of mitonuclear genotype on adult longevity were stronger in females compared to males . this was corroborated in one-way mixed model anovas of the effect of mitonuclear genotype across all seven genotypes , where effects on longevity were stronger in females  compared to males . the same was true, albeit to a lesser extent, for desiccation resistance . in summary, mtdna variation had sizeable effects on adult longevity but these effects were contingent upon the nudna background and were generally stronger in females compared to males. in contrast, we found no significant mtdna effects on desiccation resistance in adult flies.table  <dig> the effects of mitochondrial haplotype , nuclear genetic background , sex and their interactions on adult longevity

discussion
our study adds to a handful of studies demonstrating important functional phenotypic differences between sympatric mtdna haplotypes, in vivo  as well as in vitro . collectively, this empirical body of research suggests that the long-standing view of segregating mtdna variation as being selectively neutral may often be misplaced. in the case of d. subobscura, it is highly likely that the phenotypic sex-specific effects on longevity and egg-to-adult survival seen here translates into differences in fitness across mtdna haplotypes in nature, especially considering the fact that previous studies documented differences in whole-organism metabolic rate  <cit>  and other key life-history traits  <cit>  between flies carrying alternate sympatric mtdna haplotypes.

given that selection should act on mtdna variation within populations of d. subobscura  <cit>  one might ask what processes could act to maintain the typical pattern of within-population variation seen in this species; with haplotype i and ii co-occurring at fairly similar frequencies. our results provide three important and relevant insights. first, we found that functional mtdna effects were contingent upon the nuclear genome with which they were co-expressed. intergenomic epistatic interactions between the two genomes have previously been documented across populations in many taxa  and it has been suggested that such mitonuclear interactions may be important also in d. subobscura  <cit> . our study confirms that this is indeed the case and it provides a rare example of segregating within-population mitonuclear genetic variation which is demonstrably functional.

second, we found that mitonuclear genetic effects were sex-specific. this was both strongly suggested in our analysis of adult sex-ratios, presumably reflecting sex-specific egg-adult-survival, and directly demonstrated by the sex × mtdna × nudna interactions seen for adult longevity. similar sex-specific mitonuclear effects have previously been documented in d. melanogaster . they are of key importance from a theoretical point of view, as models have shown that sex-specificity of mitonuclear genetic effects can act to maintain stable mtdna polymorphism  <cit> . in particular, it has been shown that sex-specific adult viability selection on mitonuclear types promotes the maintenance of mitonuclear polymorphism  <cit> . mitonuclear fitness interactions in females are key here; mitonuclear interactions in females are more effective in generating and maintaining mitonuclear polymorphism, simply because females co-transmit mitonuclear combinations while males do not  <cit> . from this perspective, it is very interesting to note that the mitonuclear genetic effects on adult longevity seen in our study were generally stronger in females than in males. similarly, a previous study  <cit>  found that mtdna effects on whole-organism metabolic rate were larger in females than in males in d. subobscura. the lack of selection on mtdna in males can also generate a male-specific genetic load, known as the mother’s curse  <cit> . this should, however, be particularly evident in male fertility traits  <cit> , which were not assayed here.

third, the phenotypic effects of nudna and mtdna x nudna seen in our study provides indirect evidence for linkage disequilibrium between mtdna haplotypes and nuclear genes, as the nuclear genomes were classified based on the mtdna haplotype with which they were co-expressed in the founding population. the founding population should therefore have been characterized by a statistical association between mtdna and nudna. measurable linkage disequilibrium between mtdna haplotypes and nuclear genetic markers has previously been demonstrated in d. subobscura  <cit> . such disequilibria can be generated and maintained by continual mixing of spatially subdivided, and locally adapted populations  and/or by sex-specific selection on mitonuclear genotypes  <cit> . we suggest that the sex-specific effects of mitonuclear genotypes seen here, in combination with the fact that the two dominating mtdna haplotypes  occur at roughly equal frequencies in most populations e.g.  <cit> , points to a major role for selection in the maintenance of mitonuclear disequilibria in d. subobscura.

earlier attempts to shed light on the widespread mtdna polymorphism in natural d. subobscura populations assayed similar sets of fitness components as in our study but did not control for nuclear genetic variation  <cit> . one study  <cit>  found that haplotype ii tended to outperform haplotype i in their native nuclear genetic backgrounds, in terms of developmental time, male longevity and resistance to desiccation in both sexes. they were, however, unable to separate mitochondrial and nuclear genetic effects. in another study  <cit>  a single common nuclear genetic background was used and no differences between the two haplotypes were found. our results  are consistent with the later study since we generally did not observe significant main differences between haplotypes i and ii, although haplotype i tended to outperform haplotype ii . recently, the authors of a study that assessed metabolic rate suggested that negative frequency dependent selection may contribute to the maintenance of haplotype i and ii  <cit> . this suggestion was based on  roughly equal frequencies of haplotypes i and ii over the entire species range,  the dynamics of haplotype change in laboratory populations  <cit>  and  recent evidence for negative frequency dependent selection on mtdna in another insects species  <cit> . while this may be true, the result of our study suggests an additional mechanism; sex-specific viability selection on mitonuclear genotypes may contribute both to the maintenance of mtdna polymorphism and to mitonuclear linkage disequilibrium  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we found no significant main differences between sympatric mtdna haplotypes in d. subobscura. instead, important phenotypic effects of mtdna variation were contingent upon the nuclear genetic background and were sex-specific. our findings provide novel support for the possibility that sex-specific mitonuclear selection contributes to the maintenance of mitonuclear genetic variation in this model system.
