BACKGROUND
inflammatory diseases such as mastitis, inflammatory bowel disease, metritis and laminitis are economically important diseases for the dairy industry. mastitis is the most common amongst them, alone accounting for losses in excess of $ <dig> billion to the us dairy industry  <cit> . a number of therapeutic, prophylactic and management strategies have been proposed to minimize this complex disease. however, a widely accepted complimentary strategy is based on improving the host genetics through selective breeding. since it is difficult to use a direct index to measure the mastitis phenotype, milk somatic cell score  is often used as an indirect index to select animals for breeding  <cit> . milk scs is a log <dig> score of the milk somatic cell count and has been genetically correlated with clinical mastitis   <cit> . it has been demonstrated in sheep that intramammary infections occur less frequently after one generation of breeding for low scs <cit> . breeding strategies in dairy cattle are similarly based on selection for low estimated breeding values  for scs  <cit> .

the etiology of mammary inflammatory disorders is diverse and may include infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. in order for an effective host immune response to occur against a wide variety of pathogens, the host must possess receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns associated with different classes of pathogens. these are referred to as pathogen associated molecular patterns . receptors that recognize pamps are collectively referred to as pattern recognition molecules   <cit> . the prms are expressed widely by different cells including monocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells and epithelial cells  <cit> . pamp recognition leads to the secretion of cytokines and chemokines by the epithelial cells that recruit effector cells  of the immune system to the site of infection where they contribute to the host inflammatory immune response and subsequent acquired immune response.

phagosomal toll-like receptor- <dig>  is involved in recognizing pamps associated with gram-positive bacteria. murine studies for example, have demonstrated that tlr <dig> is in involved in the early recruitment of neutrophils in response to intraperitoneal challenge with either staphylococcus aureus, or peptidoglycan  from s. aureus  <cit> . ruminant studies have demonstrated that tlr <dig> gene  expression occurs in dermal and gut-associated tissues  <cit> , and is highly induced during mastitis caused by s. aureus  <cit> . bovine tlr <dig> was recently radiation hybrid mapped to bos taurus autosome   <dig>  <cit> .

caspase recruitment domain  <dig> , also known as nucleotide oligomerization domain  <dig> , is a cytosolic protein capable of initiating inflammation following pamp recognition. the gene encoding bovine card <dig>  is located on bta <dig>  it was previously categorized as a member of the caterpiller family, but was reassigned to the phylogenetically conserved nlr  protein family  <cit> . card <dig> shares a common tripartite domain structure with other members of this family. the tripartite domain consists of a carboxy -terminal leucine rich repeat  domain; a central nacht  domain, and an amino  – terminal domain that is composed of two card domains. the lrr domain is involved primarily in the recognition of bacterial peptidoglycans , whereas the central nacht domain facilitates self-oligomerization and has atpase activity. the card domains are known to interact with card containing serine/threonine kinase rip <dig> , via homophilic card-card interaction; this leads to the activation of nf-κb  <cit> .

the major portion of the pgn recognition system in mammals is constituted by card <dig> along with nod <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> . card <dig> is involved in intracellular recognition of muramyl dipeptide , the minimal bioactive structure of pgn, which is common to the cell wall of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. therefore, card <dig> acts as a general sensor of bacterial infection  <cit> . a recent study suggests that nod <dig> might be involved in sensing of pgn motifs of s. aureus, after its phagocytosis  <cit> . there are several reports of interactions between card <dig> and other prms, especially tlr <dig>  <cit> . this demonstrates the importance of card <dig> in signalling events associated with recognition of different pamps. polymorphisms, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms , within the genes coding for different receptor proteins may impair the ability of certain individuals to respond properly to infections  <cit> . in the case of tlr <dig> and card <dig>  they have been identified as susceptibility loci for different inflammatory bowel diseases in humans  <cit> . it is possible that snps within these genes influence other inflammatory diseases such as mastitis in cattle. therefore, understanding the genetic variation underlying prms might help livestock breeders to identify and select animals with enhanced resistance to mastitis for breeding programs. the purpose of this study was to identify snps in the bovine tlr <dig> and card <dig> and to evaluate the association of these snps with scs and other production traits in a population of canadian holstein bulls.

RESULTS
snp detection
investigation of the coding exon, flanking introns and promoter sequences of tlr <dig> revealed no polymorphisms. investigation of exonic, flanking intronic and promoter sequences of card <dig> revealed the presence of four snps, including two transitions: a ↔ g at position c.2886-14a>g and a ↔ t at position c.3020a>t, and two transversions: a ↔ c at position c.4500a>c and c ↔ t at position c.4950c>t . the nomenclature adopted for the snps was based on the convention described by the human genome variation society  <cit> . no snps were found in the promoter sequence from the set of animals used in this study. snp c.2886-14a>g was the only polymorphism found in the flanking intronic sequence . all the other snps were found in exon  <dig>  snp c.3020a>t was found in the coding sequence of exon  <dig> and is non-synonymous; allele 'a' producing leucine and allele 't' producing glutamine in the peptide sequence. the snps were submitted to the national centre for biotechnology information  and were released in dbsnp build  <dig> 

genotypic and allelic frequencies
the genotypic and allelic frequencies are summarized in table  <dig>  the individual frequencies of the genotypes were in hardy-weinberg equilibrium for all the snps, as determined by chi-square test. the calculated chi-square values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and were all non-significant . the linkage disequilibrium was evaluated for all pairs of snps using r <dig>  the r <dig> values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and were all significant  except for the pair consisting of snps c.4500a>c and snpc.4950c>t.

snp association analyses
statistical analyses revealed associations between card <dig> snp c.3020a>t and ebvs for milk yield, protein yield, udder depth, and scs and between snp c.4500a>c and milk yield, fat yield and protein yield. amongst all the possible regression models for scs, a single snp model including snp c.3020a>t was found to be the best model and showed significant association of this snp with scs . the average allele substitution effect of this snp for scs was  <dig> , with allele 't' increasing scs over allele 'a' . all significant associations were retained at 8% experimental-wise significance level by permutation test. a complete description of the average allele substitution effects is presented in table  <dig>

discussion
tlr <dig> and card <dig> play a role in the initiation of inflammatory and immune responses to bacterial infections. a number of studies have reported that snps in prms of different species play an important role in contributing towards disease susceptibility. therefore, the main objective of this study was to identify snps in the tlr <dig> and card <dig> and to estimate the extent of associations between these snps and scs, a trait directly related to udder inflammation. in the current experiment, the dna pool used for the purpose of snp detection was comprised of dna samples from  <dig> animals with extreme ebvs for scs. the exons, flanking intronic sequences, and promoter region were targeted for snp detection. therefore it is unlikely, that all snps in the population were identified.

although no snps were identified in tlr <dig>  four snps were identified in card15; only one snp was found in the coding region  of this gene. this snp, located in exon  <dig>  is a non-synonymous snp coding the terminal lrr domain of card <dig> receptor. while allele 'a' at this position codes for glutamine, allele 't' codes for leucine. the association of the t allele with increased scs and decreased udder depth, which predisposes animals to mammary infections, indicates that changes in the composition of the lrr domain of card <dig> may contribute to disease susceptibility. the terminal lrr domains, as in card <dig>  are common to different prms and are responsible for pamp recognition. there are several reports of polymorphisms in the human and mouse lrr coding gene segments that contribute to differential binding to several bacterial components  <cit> . in humans, card <dig> variants have been hypothesized to alter bacterial component recognition by altering the structure of lrr domain or the adjacent region  <cit> . it is possible that snp c.3020a>t may compromise protein functionality by altering the conformation of the binding site in a similar fashion. this could contribute to the development of inflammatory disorders and warrants further investigation. the association between this snp and udder depth might be an indirect result of the genetic correlation that exists between scs and udder depth   <cit> .

strong associations were also observed between the analyzed card <dig> snps and production traits. such associations may be a result of linkage between these snps and other genes on the same chromosome having a significant effect on these production traits. significant qtls have been found on bta <dig> for all the traits used in the analysis. while qtls for scs and udder composite index exist close to the location of this gene  <cit>  on the chromosome, qtls for milk yield, protein yield and fat yield were situated farther away   <cit> .

haplotype reconstruction revealed all four possible card <dig> haplotypes to be segregating in the sampled bulls. the second most frequent haplotype  differed significantly from the most common haplotype  with respect to its effect on scs ebvs. in agreement with the results of the allele substitution analyses, the linear effect of hap <dig> carrying the allele 't' at snp position c.3020a>t was significantly different from hap <dig>  however, we did not see any difference between the linear effects of hap <dig> and hap <dig> for scs. strong associations were observed between hap <dig> and milk and protein yields . since, hap <dig> carries alleles 't' and 'c', both of which are associated with increased milk and protein yields, these results were in agreement with the allele substitution analysis. it is interesting to note that the most common haplotype, hap <dig>  carries alleles 'a' and 'c' at positions c.3020a>t and c.4500a>c respectively, and is beneficial not only for reducing scs but also for increasing production. thus selection for hap <dig> in the population seems promising.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, four snps in card <dig> in a sample of canadian holstein bulls were discovered. statistical analyses revealed that snp c.3020a>t was associated with ebvs for scs and udder depth and milk and protein yields, while snp c.4500a>c was only associated with milk, fat and protein yields. the most common haplotypes for these two snps in the population differed significantly for their effect on scs. moreover, the most common haplotype carried alleles at both loci that are favourable for reducing scs and increasing production ebvs. this implies that these two snp, together with other gene polymorphisms, may be potentially used for genetic selection for mastitis resistance and production. the findings of this study indicate that snp c.3020a>t is a candidate for further detailed studies on its functional mechanisms.
