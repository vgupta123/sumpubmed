BACKGROUND
since shortly after its introduction into europe, maize has been recognized to be an excellent forage plant and is now the most important annual forage crop in northern europe. despite the fact that maize silage provides roughage with high energy content, large genetic variations in cell wall digestibility have been established between maize genotypes  <cit> . the lignified grass cell wall is a composite material with cellulose microfibrils, an amorphous matrix consisting of hemicelluloses  with very little pectins, and phenolics. phenolics are comprised of lignins, which are essential for the structural integrity of tissues and impart hydrophobicity to vascular elements. they also are comprised of cell wall-linked p-coumaric  ferulic, and diferulic acid derivatives. lignins are the only cell wall component resistant to micro-organism degradation. hence, lignin content is a primary factor involved in cell wall digestibility variation. in addition, lignin variable structure and the intensity of cross-linkages between cell wall components also have variable depressive effects on cell wall carbohydrate degradation by microorganisms in the cow rumen.  <cit> . the lignin pathway begins after the shikimate pathway with the deamination of l-phenylalanine into cinnamic acid. successive steps including hydroxylation and methylation on the aromatic ring lead to production of three monolignols . the latter are polymerized into lignins, giving rise to the three p-hydroxyphenyl , guaiacyl  and syringyl  monomeric units. in the maize lignin pathway, caffeic acid o-methyltransferase  is specifically involved in methylation of 5-hydroxy-coniferaldehyde into sinapaldehyde.

besides the reddish brown pigmentation of the leaf midrib and stalk pith associated with lignified tissues, brown-midrib  mutants of maize were early distinguished by their lower lignin content and modified lignin structure  <cit> . among the four non-allelic bm mutants, bm <dig> exhibits the strongest phenotype and was early considered to be a powerful model in cell wall digestibility improvement and lignification studies  <cit> . compared with normal hybrids, cell wall digestibility of isogenic bm <dig> genotypes was increased by about  <dig> percentage points  <cit> . correlatively, and based on several experiments with lactating cows  <cit> , the intake of bm <dig> silage by dairy cows was always higher than the intake of normal silage . a higher milk yield of cows fed bm <dig> hybrids was also reported in most experiments. every time this trait was recorded, an increase in body weight was also observed in cattle fed with bm <dig> silage. however, the bm <dig> mutation has adverse effects on agronomic traits such as lower biomass yield and higher susceptibility to lodging and diseases, especially in early maize genetic backgrounds. as a consequence, only a few late maize hybrids are available for farmers on the us market  <cit> .

since the precursory studies done from  <dig> to  <dig>  extensive research has been devoted to maize bm <dig> plants in order to establish the key determining factors in their higher feeding value, with an in- depth description of their specific lignification patterns  <cit> . the lignin content of maize bm <dig> mutant plants is reduced by about  <dig> to  <dig> %, with a partly correlative reduced content of pca esters by about  <dig> %. in the sixties, kuc et al.  <cit>  established that the frequency of s units was reduced in bm <dig> mutants, and they suspected the occurrence of additional not yet detected units. the thioacidolysis s/g ratio was shown to be reduced from  <dig>  –  <dig>  in normal plants to  <dig>  –  <dig>  in bm <dig> plants, and the additional units in lignins were identified as 5-hydroxyguaiacyl  units  <cit> . the reduction in pca esters thus appeared consistent with the preferential acylation of s units by p-coumaric acid  <cit> . the content of alkali-releasable fa in bm <dig> mature plants was not altered  <cit> . in younger plants, marita et al.  <cit>  obtained a greater amount of fa esterified to arabinoxylans in the bm <dig> cell walls. however, similar cross-linking between arabinoxylans  was obtained.

a nearly null comt activity has been shown in maize bm <dig> plants  <cit> . vignols et al.  <cit>  and morrow et al.  <cit>  later established that bm <dig> mutants had an altered exon  <dig> of the comt gene, with different events likely corresponding to different insertions/excisions of a transposable element. down-regulation of comt in maize gave plants with similar lignin patterns as observed in bm <dig> mutants  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a lignin devoid of s units was observed due to a mutation in the gene encoding ferulate 5-hydroxylase   <cit> , while the arabidopsis "bm3" mutant lacking the following comt step in the pathway only had a reduced s content  <cit> . only one comt sequence is described in databases for maize, and a unique comt in maize would seem to be the most probable hypothesis to date. the presence, even clearly reduced, of s units in bm <dig> lignins then raises a question about a substitutive pathway, and/or a substitutive omt. in contrast to s unit content, normal ferulic acid content was observed in bm <dig> or as <dig> plants, showing that comt is very likely not involved in its biosynthesis. ferulic acid biosynthesis in maize is still not clearly understood and different putative pathways have been discussed recently  <cit> . based on the data of nair et al.  <cit>  with the ref <dig> mutant of arabidopsis, ferulic acid could be produced in maize beyond the monolignol pathway. ferulic acid could be derived from oxidation of the corresponding aldehyde, rather than acting as a precursor of this aldehyde.

in contrast to phenolic compounds, only a few changes in cell wall carbohydrate characteristics were observed in bm <dig> plants. the cellulose content of bm <dig> maize was nearly the same as in normal plants, and the hemicellulose content was reported to be slightly or significantly higher in bm <dig> plants  <cit> . the composition of hemicelluloses also appeared to be little modified in bm <dig> plants. in plant stalks with just emerging tassels, marita et al.  <cit>  found a higher xylan content  in bm <dig> mutants. similarly, the xylan substitution with arabinose was a little lower in bm <dig> maize than in normal maize. a minor but significant decrease was also observed for rhamnose in bm <dig> plants  <cit> .

little data is available on histological comparisons of normal and bm <dig> tissues. based on scanning electron microscopy observations  <cit> , the sclerenchyma of bm <dig> stem tissues appeared less dense, less rigid and less thick, with larger cell lumens than in normal plants. moreover, the parenchyma of bm <dig> plants was more rapidly degraded in rumen fluid and the sclerenchyma walls were highly degraded and considerably thinned in bm <dig> plants. in contrast, the sclerenchyma of normal plants was little changed even after  <dig> hours of incubation in the rumen fluid.

in a study devoted to a comparison of  <dig> cell wall gene expressions in 20-day-old normal and bm plants  <cit> , only seven genes were differentially expressed in the bm <dig> mutant. the seven genes were all over-expressed except for the disrupted comt. gene expression was also investigated in young stems of three normal and bm <dig> lines. the latter were harvested  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after germination, with a micro-array containing nearly  <dig>  ests  <cit> . out of  <dig> candidate ests putatively involved in cell wall digestibility variation, only  <dig> were differentially expressed between bm <dig> and normal isogenic plants.

the first objective of the present study was to investigate variations in expression of cell wall related genes in older and more lignified tissues of bm <dig>  comt down-regulated, and normal silking maize plants. investigations were based on ear  and basal  internodes which differ in their physiological maturity. a second objective was to relate variation in gene expression to the previously described modifications in cell wall components, lignin content and structure of bm <dig> and comt down-regulated plants. a third objective was to find new factors involved in maize cell wall lignification and assembly, in order to further improve forage maize feeding value. expression studies were based on a macro-array specifically devoted to cell wall and lignification topics developed in cnrs-ups toulouse for such investigations  <cit> .

RESULTS
lignin pathway gene expression in normal f <dig> basal and ear internodes of maize
older and younger lignification stages were compared in basal and ear internodes of the f <dig> normal line. all genes known to be involved in constitutive monolignol biosynthesis had a higher expression in younger ear internodes, indicating their higher lignification activity, than in older basal internodes . an expression at least three times higher was thus observed for genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyases , cinnamate 4-hydroxylases , 4-coumarate:coa ligases , caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferases , f5h, comt, cinnamoyl-coa reductases , cinnamyl and sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenases . expressions of hydroxycinnamoyl transferases  and p-coumaroyl-shikimate/quinate 3'-hydroxylases  genes were low, raising the possibility of other still unknown homolog genes involved in the pathway. among the five maize ccoaomt genes shown to be expressed in maize by guillaumie et al.  <cit> , the most expressed genes were ccoaomt <dig> and ccoaomt <dig> in ear and basal internodes, respectively. previously described ccoaomt <dig>  <cit>  was the second most expressed gene in younger internodes and in older ones. laccase genes were more expressed than peroxidase genes, and more expressed in older internodes, probably confirming the involvement of laccases in monolignol polymerization. however, three peroxidases, including zmpox <dig> and zmpox <dig>  had a reverse expression pattern and were more expressed in younger tissues. these peroxidases could be assumed to be more specifically involved in the first steps of cell wall assembly.

lignin content and cell wall digestibility in comt under-expressed and disrupted plants
cell wall content was a little lower in as <dig> basal internodes, which is likely related to a higher soluble carbohydrate content in this line. lignin content, estimated as klason lignin  <cit>  in the cell wall part was reduced by  <dig> % in both f2bm <dig> and as <dig> basal internodes, with a correlative average increase by  <dig> % in cell wall digestibility, estimated as in vitro neutral detergent fiber  digestibility  <cit> .

histochemical staining and lignin pattern alterations in bm <dig> or as <dig> internodes
at silking +  <dig> days stage of plant growth, histological observations showed that xylem, sclerenchyma and parenchyma between vascular bundles were lignified. internodal transverse sections stained with maüle reagent, which enables to distinguish between s and g units, showed important differences between f <dig>  as <dig> and bm <dig> lines . all lignified tissues in f <dig> plants exhibited a red coloration, showing the presence of s units, whereas in bm <dig> line both sclerenchyma and parenchyma between bundles had a brown coloration, underlying an absence of s units in both of these cell types. in as <dig> plants, lignified parenchyma cells stained red, similar to f <dig> line, but sclerenchyma cells surrounding vascular bundles displayed an orangey color. this difference probably indicated a sclerenchyma-specific reduction of s units in as <dig> line and highlighted the fact that using adh <dig> promoter directs comt down-regulation specifically in sclerenchyma tissues  <cit> .

at silking stage, wiesner staining  and uv-light  observations of the bottom part of ear internode cross sections showed that protoxylem is lignified in all observed lines. metaxylem vessels are lignified in f <dig> line but were only weakly lignified in bm <dig> plants and not lignified in as <dig> plants.

lignin and phenylpropanoid pathway gene differential expression in bm <dig> or as <dig> internodes
the expression of the comt gene was, as expected, heavily reduced in comt-disrupted and down-regulated plants. in younger lignifying tissues of the ear internode, comt expression was reduced to a nearly null value in bm <dig> plants. despite transgene, was driven only in sclerenchyma tissues of as <dig> plants, comt under-expression was reduced by  <dig> % in as <dig> ear internodes . comt expression was reduced by 20– <dig> % in both bm <dig> and as <dig> basal internodes . more genes were differentially expressed in younger ear internodes than in older basal internodes. in addition, the pattern of gene deregulation was almost similar in bm <dig> and as <dig> plants. however, a lower number of genes were differentially expressed in as <dig> plants and their expressions were less modified than in bm <dig> plants. disruption or down-regulation of comt led to a differential expression of a limited number of genes related to the phenylpropanoid pathway, which were all over-expressed, except a pal gene in bm <dig> plants. the small number of differentially expressed genes has also been observed in younger growing bm <dig> plantlets  <cit> , illustrating a possible weak apparent co-regulation of lignin pathway genes at these developmental stages. contrary results were obtained by shi et al.  <cit>  in a f2/f2bm <dig> comparison, with differentially expressed lignin pathway genes most often under-expressed in bm <dig> plants, except for two cytochrome p <dig> 98a <dig>  over-expressed genes. observed differences could be related to variable stages of sampling and cropping conditions, and to a different set of investigated genes.

normalized expression values are given for the f <dig> line and values for each mutant are expressed as ratios of signal intensity compared to normal plants. genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed when expression ratio values were lower than  <dig>  or higher than  <dig> . values between the two thresholds are indicated in italics.

besides the under-expressed comt gene, the "new" ccoaomt <dig> and ccoaomt <dig> genes were over-expressed in young ear internodes, while the two currently known ccoaomt <dig> and ccoaomt <dig> were not differentially expressed . ccoaomt enzymes have a strict affinity for coa-ester and have no or very little affinity on corresponding acids  <cit> . consequently, it could not be considered that the two ccoaomt substitute the missing comt activity in the biosynthesis, of about a  <dig> % residual s content in bm <dig> plants  <cit> . the missing comt activity was probably substituted by other omt, whether they are over-expressed or not. plausible candidates include zrp4-like omt. several zrp4-like omt genes were indeed shown to be significantly expressed in stalk lignifying tissue  <cit> , and their role is likely not limited to methylation of suberin sub-unit precursors as initially described by held et al.  <cit> . moreover, two zrp4-like omt genes were over-expressed in bm <dig> plantlets  <cit> , including the ay <dig> zrp4-like omt which also have a tendency to be over-expressed in ear internodes of bm <dig> silking plants with a ratio equal to  <dig> . unlike the under-expressed comt, one f5h gene, whose encoded protein supplies comt in its 5-hydroxy-coniferaldehyde substrate, has an increased expression in older internodes of bm <dig> and as <dig> plants. however, this is not the case in younger ear internodes.

a pal/tal gene, which encodes the entry enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway, had a greatly reduced expression in f2bm <dig> ear internodes and, to a lesser extent, in basal internodes. however, the expression was not reduced in as <dig> internodes . a low pal expression was in agreement with the much lower lignin content of bm <dig> stalk tissues. in contrast to pal, a c4h and a 4cl gene, whose encoded proteins catalyzed the following steps of the pathway, were over-expressed in bm <dig> young internodes. also in contrast to pal under-expression, a chorismate mutase was over-expressed in the youngest internodes of both bm <dig> and as <dig> plants, upstream in the phenylpropanoid pathway. in the shikimic acid pathway, chorismate mutase is the enzyme which catalyzes the first committed step in phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis  <cit> . this allows the intra-molecular rearrangement of the enolpyruvyl chain of chorismate to produce prephenate. the chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase gene over-expressed in the ear internode of bm <dig> possibly encoded a bifunctional chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase as observed by fischer et al.  <cit> , but its involvement as a precursor supplier for lignin biosynthesis is still unknown.

the zmpox <dig> peroxidase gene, whose encoded protein is involved in constitutive lignification  <cit> , had an increased expression in bm <dig> and as <dig> plants, especially in younger internodes. simultaneously with the higher zmpox <dig> expression, two laccase genes were similarly over-expressed in bm <dig> young internodes, and one in as <dig> plants. these maize laccases were close orthologs to the poplar lac <dig> gene, whose down-regulation in poplar induced an important alteration of xylem fiber cell walls, with an increase in soluble phenolic compounds, especially in xylem parenchyma cells  <cit> .

according to nair et al.  <cit> , sinapic and probably ferulic acids in arabidopsis derived from oxidation of the corresponding aldehydes, rather than acting as precursors of those aldehydes. a putative involvement of aldehyde dehydrogenase  enzymes in maize ferulate biosynthesis has not yet been established. however, several aldh genes are expressed in lignifying tissue  <cit>  including the aldh22a <dig> arabidopsis ortholog  <cit>  over-expressed in comt deficient tissues, which was also the most expressed aldh in normal internodes. while the lignin content of bm <dig> maize plants was greatly reduced, their content in ferulates released after alkaline hydrolysis was not modified or slightly increased  <cit> .

the maize chalcone flavonone isomerase , described in maize by grotewold and peterson  <cit> , was over expressed in bm <dig> and as <dig> internodes. chi catalyzes conversion of chalcone, a yellow pigment synthesized downstream to the coumaroyl-coa, into naringenin. chi genes are regulated by myb transcription factors  <cit> , similarly to several other phenylpropanoid-related genes. because zmchi1gene is not involved in the lignin pathway, its over-expression could be interpreted as a possible reaction against over-availability of monolignol precursors.

differential expression of transcription or regulation factor genes in bm <dig> or as <dig> internodes
several transcription or regulation factors, including one athb- <dig> hd-zip iii, two argonaute, and one shatterproof mad-box ortholog gene, were over-expressed in both ear and basal internodes of bm <dig> and, to a lesser extent, as <dig> silking plants . these transcription factors were not differentially expressed in bm <dig> plantlets. however, some of the transcription factors were under-expressed in bm <dig>  bm <dig>  and/or bm <dig> plantlets  <cit> . homeodomain-leucine zipper  iii proteins are transcription factors which belong to a class of highly related proteins characterized by their expression in -vascular tissues. athb- <dig> hd-zip proteins are positively regulated by auxin and promote vascular cell division and differentiation towards the formation of xylem and vascular tissue  <cit> . argonaute genes are required for post-transcriptional gene silencing and rna interference, and many of the mirna which have thus far been identified in plants are predicted to target transcription factors involved in developmental processes  <cit> . an over-expression of an argonaute gene, as observed in bm <dig> and as <dig> deficient comt plants, is considered to induce a higher repression of target genes. the simultaneous differential expression of argonaute genes and the athb- <dig> hd-zip gene could be related. the maize rolled leaf <dig> gene  indeed encodes a hd-zip iii transcription factor, the expression of which is mediated by the mirna zmmir <dig>  <cit> . shatterproof  mads-box gene is involved, with shp <dig>  in lignification of valve margin cells adjacent to the dehiscence zone of arabidopsis siliques  <cit> . the over-expressed maize shp <dig> ortholog gene was the zmzag <dig> gene which has been described with zmzag <dig>  <cit>  as an agl6-like gene . whether such a shp maize ortholog could be involved in lignified tissue differentiation or more directly in lignification, is not yet known. however, its deregulation in bm <dig> and as <dig> tissue could for the first time illustrate a relationship between this type of regulation factor and cell wall differentiation or lignification in grass plant stalks.

normalized expression values are given for the f <dig> line and values for each mutant are expressed as ratios of signal intensity compared to normal plants. genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed when expression ratio values were lower than  <dig>  or higher than  <dig> . values between the two thresholds are indicated in italics.

differential expression of genes related to auxin signaling and tissue patterning in bm <dig> or as <dig> internodes
several genes related to auxin signaling, and/or probably involved in vessel set up or tissue patterning, were over-expressed in basal or ear internodes of comt deficient plants . this occurrence probably indicated a feedback disorganization of tissues and cell wall assembly when the activity of the key comt enzyme was missing.

normalized expression values are given for the f <dig> line and values for each mutant are expressed as ratios of signal intensity compared to normal plants. genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed when expression ratio values were lower than  <dig>  or higher than  <dig> . values between the two thresholds are indicated in italics.

pinoid  orthologous genes, of which one member was over-expressed in basal and ear bm <dig> internodes, and in ear as <dig> internodes, encode serine/threonine protein kinases. pid genes are preferentially expressed in the vascular tissue of developing organs and in xylem parenchyma cells  <cit> , and have been shown to be positive regulators of polar auxin transport  <cit> . the emb <dig> gene of arabidopsis, whose maize ortholog is over-expressed in basal internodes of bm <dig> and as <dig> plants, is involved in the maintenance of polar auxin transport. in addition, the lack of emb <dig> protein induced an irregular and discontinuous venation, with clustered or scattered tracheary elements  <cit> . the emb <dig> gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor  on adenosine diphosphate -ribolysation factor gtpase , which is involved in the targeted recycling of pin <dig> putative auxin efflux carrier  <cit> . its over-expression in bm <dig> and as <dig> plants was likely a consequence of tissue assembly with a reduced amount of s units. in addition, one monopteros  gene ortholog was over-expressed in bm <dig> ear internodes. the mp gene of arabidopsis encodes a transcription factor of the auxin response factor  family, which is also involved in vascular cell differentiation  <cit> . the arabidopsis recessive mutant "continuous vascular ring"  has a great increase in stem vascular tissue in of inter-fascicular regions  <cit> . moreover, it has been established that cov <dig> affects vascular patterning by a mechanism which is not auxin-dependant  <cit> . in addition, cov <dig> mutants were shown to be defective in synthesis, transport, or perception of an inhibitor. the maize cov <dig> ortholog over-expression in bm <dig> ear lignifying internodes thus corresponded to a higher inhibition in lignified tissue formation, possibly illustrating a feed-back effect resulting from the low availability of s units.

cucumisins are serine protease of the subtilisin family  <cit> . cucumisins are involved in the general protein turn-over as non-selective enzymes, but they also perform specific roles in the processing of precursor proteins to regulate growth and development by limited proteolysis  <cit> . the over-expressed maize cucumisin in bm <dig> and as <dig> ear internodes was the closest ortholog to a zinnia  cucumisin expressed during xylogenesis  <cit> . similarly, a subtilase  has been identified from a xylem library of arabidopsis  <cit> . the role of cucumisins in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is still unknown. however, it is plausible that several cucumisins could function during autolysis of tracheary elements. a cucumisin gene deregulation in bm <dig> internodes could be in agreement with the lower stiffness of bm <dig> plant vessels.

differential expression of transport and detoxification genes in bm <dig> or as <dig> internodes
four genes involved in transport and detoxification processes were over-expressed in bm <dig> and/or as <dig> internodes . atp-binding cassette  transporters are involved in different physiological functions such as cell signaling, transport of a broad range of substances across membranes and detoxification processes  <cit> . given their ability to transport a diverse set of small molecules across membranes, and because several abc transporters had similar expression profiles to known monolignol genes along the arabidopsis growing stem, abc transporters were assumed to be involved in the secretion of monolignols  <cit> . the maize abc transporter over-expressed in internodes of maize bm <dig> plants could thus be considered as a monolignol transporter. based on its under-expression in bm <dig> plantlets, it has been assumed to be preferentially involved in coniferyl alcohol transport  <cit> .

normalized expression values are given for the f <dig> line and values for each mutant are expressed as ratios of signal intensity compared to normal plants. genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed when expression ratio values were lower than  <dig>  or higher than  <dig> . values between the two thresholds are indicated in italics.

maize bronze2-like genes encode glutathione s-transferases . the latter are carrier proteins  <cit>  which deliver anthocyanins from the biosynthesis site to the tonoplast membrane, where an appropriate abc-type transporter moves the pigment into the vacuole  <cit> . because several abc transporters have a substrate preference for glutathione conjugates  <cit> , a coupled activity could be assumed between the two over-expressed zmgst <dig> and zmgst <dig> and the over-expressed abc transporter. the much reduced comt activity and s unit formation could induce the accumulation of phenolic compounds that have to be delivered into the vacuole as a detoxification process.

plant glucosyltransferases belong to a multigene family, which are likely differentially regulated in different biosynthesis pathways and in response to a range of environmental stimuli. glucosyltransferases have relative substrate specificity because of their extended plasticity towards metabolites of related structure  <cit> . they are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary plant metabolites and metabolization of xenobiotics. they are known in particular to have activity on both flavonoids and p-hydroxycinnamate derivatives. in addition, a grapevine udp-glucose:flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase, has been shown to be homolog to the maize bz <dig> encoded protein  <cit> . the role of the protein encoded by the differentially expressed udp-glucosyltransferase-like gene is still unknown, but it could possibly be involved in detoxification and/or transport processes.

the role of nodulin mtn21-like genes is not yet understood, but the presence of seven transmembrane domains and structural homologies with bacterial multidrug exporters might suggest a role in a transport function. the maize nodulin mtn21-like gene over-expressed in bm <dig> and/or as <dig> internodes was found to be orthologous to a zinnia nodulin mtn21-like gene expressed during xylogenesis. consequently, the maize nodulin mtn21-like gene is probably involved in transport of a component related to vascular tissue assembly.

differential expression of cell wall associated protein genes in bm <dig> or as <dig> internodes
several arabinogalactan proteins  and agp-like proteins, which belong to a class of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins , have been shown to be involved in plant xylogenesis  <cit> . some of these proteins were thus highly preferentially expressed in differentiating xylem compared with phloem  <cit> . out of the four genes encoding cell wall proteins which were differentially expressed in bm <dig> or as <dig> internodes , zmrcp <dig> and zmrcp <dig> showed especially high over-expression ratios  in ear internodes. the large differential expression values in comt deficient plants likely indicate that these agp genes are relevant targets in understanding maize cell wall assembly.

normalized expression values are given for the f <dig> line and values for each mutant are expressed as ratios of signal intensity compared to normal plants. genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed when expression ratio values were lower than  <dig>  or higher than  <dig> . values between the two thresholds are indicated in italics.

one glycine-rich protein  was the only investigated gene with an over-expression in bm <dig> internodes and an under-expression in as <dig> internodes. this significant interaction could be related to the lack of complete isogenicity of f <dig> and as <dig> genetic backgrounds, but also to the fact that comt down-regulation in as <dig> was directed specifically in sclerenchyma tissues. grp genes encode a group of cell wall structural proteins which are particularly expressed in xylem tissues  <cit> . the differentially expressed grp gene is the closest ortholog of the rice osgrp- <dig> gene  which possesses sequence elements conferring vascular-specific expression  <cit> .

the differentially expressed proline rich protein  was one of the rare genes significantly under-expressed in comt-deficient ear internodes. prp are considered to be structural components of the cell wall and are abundant in fibers and xylem  <cit> . vignols et al.  <cit>  have thus described the maize zmprp, which is expressed in vascular tissue, mainly in cells related to xylem development, but not in phloem cells. however, the differentially expressed prp and zmprp are very different genes, with only  <dig> % identity. the protein encoded by the under-expressed prp gene is a basic prp, with  <dig> % of proline amino acid and a peptide signal allowing protein secretion in the cell wall. it also presents a six-times repeated ppvtgppvtypp motif, which is different from the classic prp motif . this prp, which is probably involved in cell wall formation, appeared to be an original and possibly new type of cell wall prp.

differential expression of genes involved in nucleotide sugar interconversion and cell wall carbohydrate metabolism in bm <dig> or as <dig> internodes
the nucleotide sugar interconversion pathway comprises a set of enzymatic reactions by which plants synthesize activated monosaccharides as precursor elements of cell wall polysaccharides  <cit> . nucleotide sugars are thus substrates used for the elongation of carbohydrate chains by udp-glycosyltransferase  <cit> . cellulose is synthesized by an enzyme complex associated with the plasma membrane, using udp-d-glucose as a precursor. while udp-d-glucose is also a precursor of hemicelluloses, hemicellulose polysaccharides are formed in the golgi apparatus and are exported to the external surface of the membrane in golgi vesicles  <cit> .

seven genes of the nucleotide sugar interconversion pathway, which belonged to five multigene families, were over-expressed in bm <dig> and/or as <dig> plants . sucrose synthases catalyze a reversible reaction giving udp-d-glucose from sucrose and uridine diphosphate . udp-d-glucose dehydrogenases convert udp-d-glucose into udp-d-glucuronic acid . udp-d-glca is afterwards the substrate of udp-d-glca decarboxylases, giving udp-d-xylose, which is then converted into udp-l-arabinose in a reversible reaction catalyzed by udp-d-xylose 4-epimerases  <cit> . gdp-d-mannose  <dig> -dehydratase catalyzes the irreversible conversion of gdp-d-mannose into 4-keto-6-deoxy-gdp-d-mannose, then allowing the synthesis of gdp-fucose  <cit> . in plant stalks with just emerging tassels, a decrease in mannose content has been observed in bm <dig> plants  <cit> , which could be related to over-expression of gdp-d-mannose  <dig> -dehydratase.

normalized expression values are given for the f <dig> line and values for each mutant are expressed as ratios of signal intensity compared to normal plants. genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed when expression ratio values were lower than  <dig>  or higher than  <dig> . values between the two thresholds are indicated in italics.

several genes involved in cell wall modification during cell growth and vascular element formation were differentially expressed between normal and comt deficient plants . expansins are involved in the disruption of hydrogen bounds between cellulose microfibrils and cross-linking glycans in the cell wall. at least five different expansin genes are expressed in differentiating tracheary elements of zinnia. these genes were associated with the intrusive growth of protoxylem and with the differentiation of mesophyll cells into tracheary elements  <cit> . xyloglucan endotransglycolase/hydrolases  and glucanases modify the structure of the cell wall so that it becomes more responsive to primary wall-loosening events  <cit> . xyloglucan binds non-covalently to cellulose, coating and cross-linking adjacent cellulose microfibrils. the resulting network is considered to be the major tension-bearing structure in the primary wall  <cit> . cleavage of xyloglucan chains by hydrolytic enzyme leads to rapid wall loosening, but also induces important risks of structural failure in the absence of concomitant reinforcement. xth, capable of splitting and reconnecting xyloglucan molecules in a new position, help to satisfy the contradictory needs of growing and/or differentiating tissues  <cit> . exo and endoglucanases are involved in specific degradation of cell wall β-glucans in auxin-mediated cell elongation  <cit> . zmgnsn <dig>  which was over-expressed in ear internodes of bm <dig> and as <dig> plants, encodes an endo- <dig> – <dig> -β-d-glucanase first found in maize seedling growing tissues  <cit> . the two other over-expressed endoglucanases were ortholog to β- <dig> -glucanase, which are also considered to be involved in hydrolysis of cell components and could be induced by hormone or wounding signals  <cit> . an exoglucanase was also overexpressed in bm <dig> internodes which has been shown to preferentially hydrolyze the non-reducing terminal glucosyl residue from  <dig> -β-d-glucans  <cit> .

in maize, most hemicelluloses are arabinoxylans, with a few xyloglucans which are predominant in primary walls of dicotyledons. xyloglucans have a backbone composed of β- <dig> -glucose with up to 75% of the residues substituted with mono-, di-, or triglycosyl side chains. α- <dig> -xylosyl residues, linked to o <dig> of β- <dig> -glucose, are partly further substituted by β- <dig> -d-galactosyl. the latter can be further substituted by α- <dig> -linked fucosyl residues  <cit> . this last step is catalyzed by xyloglucan fucosyltransferases and two genes encoding members of this multigene family were over-expressed in ear internodes of comt deficient plants.

cell autolysis is a key event in tracheid formation. a maize gene ortholog to a pectate lyase  expressed in the zinnia model system was found to be over-expressed in ear internodes of bm <dig> and as <dig> plants. zepel was strongly expressed at a very early stage of tracheary element induction, and was related to the presence of auxin. moreover, in young zinnia stems, zepel expression was associated with vascular bundles  <cit> . the over-expression of this gene in bm maize is likely an indication that this type of enzyme is involved in monocotyledon plant lignification.

two cellulose synthase genes were over-expressed in bm <dig> or as <dig> internodes whereas no drastic modification was described in cellulose content in bm <dig> plants. interestingly, zmcesa- <dig> and zmcesa- <dig> are respectively homolog to ptrcesa <dig>  <cit>  and hvcesa <dig>  <cit>  genes, highly expressed in developing xylem and stem undergoing significant secondary cell wall biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
disruption or down-regulation of comt gene induced a correlative differential expression of only a few genes involved in the lignin pathway. these genes were all over-expressed, except for an under-expressed pal gene. as a consequence, deregulation of maize comt did not clearly highlight major co-regulation of lignin pathway genes. similarly, no over-expressed phenylpropanoid related gene could explain that as much as  <dig> % of s units were still present in bm <dig> lignins, with no comt expression. syringyl alcohol thus probably resulted from methylation by other omt which were sufficiently available. one zrp4-like omt gene, which was shown to be over-expressed in maize bm <dig> plantlets  <cit>  and which also had a tendency to be over-expressed in the bm <dig> ear internode, could be a candidate for the replacement of the lacking 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde methyltransferase activity.

differential gene expressions in bm <dig> and/or as <dig> internodes highlighted a probable disturbance in cell wall assembly and/or a possibly modified chronology of the different events leading to cell expansion and lignification with consequences far beyond the phenylpropanoid metabolism. the reduced availability of monolignols and s units led to deeply different walls, with probably greater differences in carbohydrate composition than currently considered. during cell wall assembly, biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid, protein, and carbohydrate constituents appeared to be inter-dependent, and the deficiency in a key-enzyme of the lignin pathway had consequences on the expression of several genes involved in cell wall metabolism. apart from a prp gene in bm <dig> plants and a grp gene in as <dig> plants, all non-lignin-pathway differentially expressed genes were also over-expressed. furthermore, the lower number of deregulated genes in as <dig> plants than in bm <dig> plants could result, in addition to the difference in genetic background of the two progenies, from the sclerenchyma-limited expression of the comt-antisens constructed gene.

the differential expression of genes in comt-deficient plants is likely an indicator of their involvement in cell wall assembly, and some of these genes are probably new relevant targets for silage and biofuel maize breeding. while the transcription factors involved in regulation of lignin biosynthesis and deposition in maize are not yet clearly understood, the differential expression of one athb- <dig> hd-zip iii, two argonaute, and one shatterproof mad-box orthologous genes between bm <dig> and normal plants could be the first evidence of their role in the cell wall metabolism. similarly, maize cov <dig> ortholog could be assumed to be involved in lignified fiber tissue patterning. finally, the comparison of gene expression in silking normal and bm <dig> plants highlighted the possible involvement in the constitutive lignin pathway of not yet considered genes, such as zrp4-like omt.
