BACKGROUND
despite the successes of antiretroviral therapies, the neurocognitive complications of aids infection  continue to be an important problem  <cit> . interestingly, clinical, neuropathological and imaging studies have demonstrated that the virus variably affects different regions of the brain  <cit> . in vivo 1h mrs studies of chronically hiv infected patients have disclosed varying metabolic abnormalities in different brain regions  <cit> . some have reported that the most profound mrs changes occur in the basal ganglia and white matter  <cit>  while others have reported significant changes in the frontal cortex of hiv patients, even in patients free of neurological symptoms  <cit> .

the simian immunodeficiency virus -infected rhesus macaque model is arguably the best animal model of neuroaids  <cit> . there are strong neuropathological similarities between hiv patients and siv-infected macaques  <cit> . in vivo macaque brain 1h mr spectra are similar to humans and post mortem and in vivo mrs studies from siv infected macaques have revealed metabolic abnormalities  <cit>  similar to those observed in hiv-infected human brains by in vivo mrs  <cit> . a power calculation conducted by greco et al. revealed that single voxel mrs at  <dig>  tesla was capable of detecting changes similar to those observed in human mrs studies for most metabolites using less than  <dig> animals  <cit> .

eight of the animals reported on in this study were allowed to progress until terminal aids or the  <dig> year endpoint of the study. pathology of the harvested brains revealed that two out of the eight animals developed sive encephalitis  as defined by the presence of perivascular infiltrates of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells  <cit> . these findings are consistent with previous reports that neuropathological changes are variable, with siv encephalitis developing in 25% of infected macaques  <cit>  similar to the incidence of encephalitis in hiv-infected humans. furthermore, spectroscopy on these animals revealed that an elevation of basal ganglia cho/cr at four weeks post-inoculation is predictive for the development of siv encephalitis  <cit> .

the objective of our study was to evaluate macaque brain regional variations during acute siv infection. during the first month of siv infection, very rapid changes in macaque blood viral load are observed  <cit>  much like its human counterpart. we previously reported that profound metabolic changes occur in the frontal cortex of macaques in the first weeks after siv infection  <cit> . to help understand brain region specific variations in hiv/aids, we evaluated the neurochemical changes observed by in vivo 1h mrs in the basal ganglia and white matter, and compared them to the changes seen in the frontal cortex in  <dig> siv-infected rhesus macaques. this study aims to reveal which brain regions are more susceptible to gliosis and neuronal injury during the primary phase of infection.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> rhesus macaques were infected with siv, and imaged with in vivo 1h mrs at multiple time points including pre-infection and up to  <dig> weeks after infection. 1h mr spectra were separately acquired from  <dig> specific brain regions, frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and centrum semiovale, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  1h mr spectra with short echo time  are characterized by resonances primarily arising from naa, mi, cr, cho, and glx . peak viremia was observed at ~11– <dig> days pi  with a mean plasma level of  <dig>  ×  <dig> copy eq./ml. at  <dig> wpi, the mean plasma viral load was  <dig>  ×  <dig> copy eq./ml

a multivariate analysis of variance  was performed for all metabolites across all time points and brain regions, and highly significant differences were found . further analyses isolated temporal  and regional differences . below, we detail the temporal metabolic changes during the first  <dig> weeks of siv infection, and the metabolic changes that occur in different brain regions.

temporal changes in metabolite concentrations during acute siv infection
the normalized changes in the mean concentrations of naa, cr, cho, mi, and glx after infection in each brain region are graphically displayed in figure  <dig>  metabolite concentrations  and the results of the statistical analyses are listed in table  <dig>  p-values were obtained using repeated measures analysis of variance  on  <dig> animals measured before infection and at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi. if significant by rm anova, holm's t-tests were used to isolate differences between the time points. additionally, paired t-tests were performed on all  <dig> animals scanned before infection and  <dig> wpi. ns indicated that anova or t-tests were not significant. the most significant changes were observed in the frontal cortex and were consistent with previous studies  <cit> . naa is significantly decreased at  <dig> wpi but is not different from baseline at  <dig> weeks. cho shows a trend towards increase at  <dig> wpi  but falls below baseline levels at  <dig> wpi. mi increases at  <dig> wpi and remains elevated. cr concentration did not change over time in the frontal cortex. thus, changes in metabolite concentration and metabolite ratios with respect to cr are similar. no change in frontal glx was identified.

p-values were obtained using repeated measures analysis of variance  on  <dig> animals measured before infection and at  <dig> and  <dig> wpi. if significant by rm anova, holm's t-tests were used to isolate differences between the time points. additionally, paired t-tests were performed on all  <dig> animals scanned before infection and  <dig> wpi. ns indicated that anova or t-tests were not significant.

interestingly, we found a significant increase in the cr concentration at  <dig> wpi in the white matter of the centrum semiovale. similar to the frontal cortex, white matter cho increases significantly at the time of peak viremia at  <dig> wpi and decreases to a level below baseline at  <dig> weeks. likewise, mi increases at  <dig> weeks and stays elevated at  <dig> weeks. however, naa concentrations in the centrum semiovale show no significant differences during the first month of infection. a significant decrease in the white matter naa/cr  at  <dig> weeks is explained by an increase in cr at that time point. again, no significant glx changes could be detected.

in the basal ganglia, absolute metabolite concentration changes over time were not statistically significant. however, while the cho concentration did not change significantly at any time point after infection, cho/cr ratio did show a significant decline of  <dig> %  between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi. inspection of the absolute concentration values of these  <dig> metabolites suggests that the change in the ratio is driven primarily by a decline in cho, and the lower variances observed in ratios accounts for the observation of the statistically significant decline. notably, a decline in cho/cr between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi was also observed in the frontal cortex  and the white matter . basal ganglia naa and glx changes after infection were not significant. if present, they are within the experimental error of the measurements.

correlations between metabolite concentration changes in different regions
to determine whether metabolic markers, naa, cho, mi, cr and glx levels change in a similar fashion during acute siv infection in the frontal cortex, white matter and basal ganglia, spearman rank correlation analyses were undertaken. table  <dig> summarizes the correlations between metabolite concentration changes in different regions. the rationale for correlating the changes of metabolites in different brain regions was to determine if the metabolic responses were uniform throughout the brain or if some regions are affected to a greater extent. we interpret positive correlations to mean that the responses to infection are similar in different brain regions, and that the responses are different when they do not correlate.

for this purpose the percent change from baseline were calculated for each individual monkey for all time points. significant p-values are noted in bold. p-values with a trend towards significance  are noted italics and non-significant differences are indicated by ns. however, it must be noted that when the correlations are subjected to bonferroni correction, a p-value of <  <dig>  is required for significance.

no significant correlations between naa concentration changes in the frontal cortex and white matter, and between frontal cortex and basal ganglia naa were found. while no significant temporal changes in naa were found in the basal ganglia or white matter, spearman rank analysis revealed a significant association between white matter and basal ganglia changes . for the choline changes, spearman rank analyses revealed correlations between all three brain regions . mi changes were correlated between frontal cortex and basal ganglia , but not between white matter and the other two regions. there was no significant correlation between cr concentration changes in the three brain regions. finally, glx changes were correlated between frontal cortex and basal ganglia , but, no correlation was found between white matter and basal ganglia. a trend was found between glx changes in the frontal cortex and white matter.

correlations between metabolite concentration changes and plasma viral loads
we also investigated correlations between plasma viral load and metabolite concentration changes in the  <dig> volumes of interest . viral load data was obtained from  <dig> animals at  <dig> and/or  <dig> wpi for a total of  <dig> data points. using spearman rank, we found a significant correlation between the change in the cho/cr ratio in the frontal cortex and change in the plasma viral loads at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks combined . in addition, we found a correlation between plasma viral loads and cho/cr changes in the basal ganglia  and cho changes in bg . there was no relationship between wm changes and plasma viral loads. furthermore, there was no relationship between any of the other metabolite concentrations/ratios and viral loads. however, due to the small sample size, we consider these analyses highly preliminary.

discussion
a long-standing observation in patients infected with hiv is that different parts of the brain appear to be variably affected by the virus. evidence for variable response to the virus by different brain regions has come from clinical, pathological and imaging studies. to help gain a better understanding of this phenomenon, we used in vivo 1h mr spectroscopy to probe how different regions of the macaque brain respond metabolically during the first month of siv infection, a time point not normally accessible by clinical studies. at the time of peak viremia, a transient decline in the naa resonance, reflecting temporary neuronal injury, was only detected in the frontal cortex. on the other hand, changes in cho and mi were similar across brain regions. the cr resonance appeared stable in all regions and times with the exception of white matter where a transient increase was observed at peak viremia.

evidence of neuronal injury is detected only in the frontal cortex
a decrease in naa is only observed in the frontal cortex at  <dig> wpi, the time of peak viremia. naa is almost exclusively located in neurons, and a decrease in naa reflects neuronal loss  <cit>  or reversible neuronal injury  <cit> . lentz et al. showed that encephalitis severity correlates with decreased naa/cr levels in the frontal cortex in the macaque model of neuroaids  <cit> . with the reduction of siv plasma viral load by 1– <dig> orders of magnitude at  <dig> wpi, naa levels are also no longer abnormal, suggesting that partial immunologic control of the virus is sufficient to result in neuronal recovery. the selective neuronal vulnerability of frontal cortex to siv infection is further supported by the observation of significant decreases in synaptophysin  in the frontal cortex but not in the basal ganglia . syn is an integral membrane glycoprotein in presynaptic vesicles. its decline indicates a disruption in synaptic transmission and it is therefore a sensitive marker of neuronal dysfunction. we have previously shown that syn is highly correlated to in vivo naa/cr measurements in this same siv/macaque model of neuroaids  <cit> .

choline changes in the same manner in the brain regions
the cho levels appear to change in a similar fashion in all brain regions after siv infection. this implies that the changes are global, and not specific to any particular brain region. mi increased significantly in the fc and wm, and mi changes correlated between frontal cortex and basal ganglia , but not between white matter and the other two regions. it must be noted that when the correlations are subjected to bonferroni correction, the mi correlations lose significance, however, the choline correlations between the regions remain significant after bonferroni correction. at the time of peak viremia, cho levels are elevated, and they decrease to baseline levels or lower with a reduction of plasma viral load at  <dig> wpi. an increase in cho may reflect altered membrane metabolism  <cit> , and may be associated with cerebral inflammation. its elevation is believed to reflect cellular responses, including cell proliferation, recruitment, microgliosis, and/or astrocytosis in neuroaids  <cit> . evidence of the association with astrocytosis is given by our observations of elevated gfap at the same time point in this model  <cit> .

in a previous report  <cit>  we reported that cho levels in the frontal cortex decreased to levels significantly below baseline by  <dig> wpi. in extending our analyses to other regions we find that at  <dig> wpi cho levels are below baseline in the white matter and basal ganglia, but these are not significant. however, significant declines in cho were observed in all  <dig> regions between  <dig> and  <dig> wpi, a period when viral loads are substantially reduced. the best interpretation of this observation is that it is a manifestation of brain recovery and healing.

cerebral mi increased almost linearly after siv infection. mi is located primarily in glia; thus, elevation of mi is considered to reflect increased glial cell activity  <cit> . an elevation of mi has been commonly reported in studies of chronically infected hiv patients  <cit> . the increases in mi were not as highly correlated between the brain regions, but they appeared to increase in all  <dig> regions almost linearly up to  <dig> wpi. we have previously reported that there is a complex relationship between astrocytosis and mi, as well as between astrocytosis and cho  <cit> . the data reported here on cho and mi continue to support a complex relationship among these measurements that occur when the animal is infected. further studies are necessary to elucidate the relationships.

creatine increases during acute siv infection in white matter
at the time of peak viremia, cr concentrations were significantly increased in the white matter of the centrum semiovale. changes in total cr  are associated with altered energy metabolism. elevated cr levels have been reported in the frontal white matter of chronic hiv patients  <cit> . it is believed that the virus enters the brain through infected monocytes that later differentiate into macrophages  <cit> . during this process of mononuclear cell infiltration, glial-cell activation and proliferation may manifest high tissue metabolism which would explain an increase in cr. energy change as a function of enhanced glial activation is supported by our finding that the greatest increases in mi and cho are in the same regions as the highest increase in cr . our finding that creatine changes are not uniform across the brain regions is consistent with the study by chang et al.  <cit>  who reported creatine increases in the white matter but decreases in the basal ganglia in later stages of aids dementia complex.

comparison of hiv and siv
most hiv mrs studies are performed during the chronic stage of infection, often with subjects who are on antiretroviral therapy. our macaque study focuses on acute siv infection, a period that has not yet been studied by mrs in hiv infection. acute siv infection induces the most profound naa changes in the frontal cortex, and more subtle and difficult to detect changes in the basal ganglia and white matter. we hypothesize that hiv in humans might produce similar responses during the primary infection as those described here. during primary infection, hiv and siv proliferate to very high levels for a short time. as the immune system responds to the infection, plasma virus drops to lower levels. there may be recurrence of high viremia with the progressive weakening of the immune system by the virus. anti-retroviral therapy will suppress viral production at this stage. it is only at the last stage, with the collapse of the immune system, that very high viremia is once again observed. there are very few reported mrs studies of people with early  <cit>  or late high viremia  <cit> . it is possible that the difference in viral loads in patients is the most important factor responsible for differences mrs patterns that have been reported.

the macaque model has similar mr spectroscopic changes  as in human neuroaids, suggesting that neurochemical and cellular responses to siv and hiv are similar. however, the specific pattern of mrs changes in various brain regions of the acutely siv-infected macaque appears different from that seen in humans. both, single voxel mrs and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging  studies performed before the advent of anti-retroviral therapy demonstrated profound declines in the levels of naa in advanced cognitively impaired patients  <cit> . in the early stages of cognitive dysfunction, cho/cr and mi/cr were shown to be elevated prior to changes in naa  <cit> .

more recently in the anti-retroviral era, in vivo 1h mrs studies of hiv patients have consistently found metabolic abnormalities in different brain regions  <cit> . some groups have reported that the most profound mrs changes occur in the basal ganglia and white matter  <cit> . others have reported significant changes in the frontal cortex of hiv patients, even in patients free of neurological symptoms  <cit> . additionally, recent high spatial resolution neuroimaging investigations using sophisticated analytic methods have found diminution in the thickness of the cortical mantle  <cit> .

in this study we found region specific responses with respect to naa but not choline. mrsi studies investigating the regional metabolic responses in hiv infected patients with hiv associated dementia were found to be quite variable. some report evidence of uniform metabolic abnormalities  in various brain regions and conclude that abnormalities of cerebral metabolites in hiv-infected patients may be part of a diffuse process  <cit> . however, some mrsi studies observe naa/cr decreases  <cit>  and cho/cr increases  <cit>  in gray matter regions and not in white matter in patients with aids dementia complex. additionally, barker et al. reported that the largest reductions in naa and increases in cho were in the frontal lobe white matter and there were no changes in the cortical gray matter  <cit> . this great variability could be the result of many factors including: disease stage; the presence, type and duration of antiretroviral treatment; co-morbidities including drug abuse; and differences in imaging parameters such as pulse sequence, te and tr.

we also investigated potential correlations between plasma viral load and metabolite concentration changes. we previously reported  <cit>  a significant relationship between changes in cho/cr and plasma viral loads  by spearman rank correlation analyses. here, we found a correlation between plasma viral loads and cho/cr changes in the basal ganglia and cho changes in bg. there was no relationship between wm cho changes and plasma viral loads or between any of the other metabolite concentrations/ratios and viral loads. these preliminary findings are different from what has been reported for patients with hiv, however, our study focuses on the acute phase of infection, unlike human studies which involve chronically infected individuals. among hiv+ patients higher plasma viral loads are typically associated with lower naa  <cit>  and higher mi  <cit> . another study reported that csf but not plasma viral load correlated with cho/cr in the white matter  <cit> . again, there are many potential reasons for differences in correlations that have been reported between viral loads and mrs metabolites.

possible mechanisms of regional brain metabolic abnormalities
the leading theory of neuroaids pathogenesis is that infected/activated monocytes traffic into the cns, where they differentiate into macrophages, and set off a cascade of events that ultimately result in neuronal injury  <cit> . one possibility that may explain regional variations in brain injury is that there are differences in the rate of monocyte trafficking into various brain regions. however, the similarity in the changes in cho and mi observed in all regions suggests that the trafficking is globally similar. this is supported by the finding of similar astrocytic activation in frontal cortex and basal ganglia . however, while the evidence suggests that viral invasion is globally similar, neuronal injury is selective to the frontal cortex. cortical neurons may be more susceptible to injury or neuronal protective/recovery mechanisms may be more effective in other regions.

the relationship of brain metabolic changes with respect to the level of virus in the blood is important. the greatest changes in naa, cho and cr occur at the time of peak viremia followed by near normalization within  <dig> weeks. this sensitivity of the brain to events in the blood indicates a highly dynamic pathogenic process with the rapid transit of virally-infected monocytes into the brain and an equally rapid response by the brain to these events. the highly dynamic nature is further supported by the rapid normalization as plasma viral load decreases. notably, this normalization occurs despite persistent virus in the blood, although not at peak levels. this observation suggests there may be a competition between pathogenic and protective mechanisms, and that a threshold level of viral load and trafficking, virally-infected monocytes must be exceeded for brain metabolic response to be manifested.

patient management
our results imply that the virus has a global effect on microgliosis and astrogliosis. however, only cortical regions, here the frontal cortex, are affected by neuronal injury, suggesting that some regions of the brain are more vulnerable to invasion by siv or hiv infected macrophages. these results may support the use of a combination of antiretroviral therapy early to decrease influx of infected/activated monocytes/macrophages that lead to inflammation and neuroprotective drugs which pass the bbb in order to prevent neuronal injury in region of the brain in which the innate recovery mechanisms fail.

mr spectroscopy should be considered for use in clinical hiv patient care to monitor changes in metabolism indicative of neuronal dysfunction possibly predictive of cognitive dysfunction. single voxel mrs  <cit>  as well as magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging   <cit>  have been performed on patients with hiv dementia. single voxel mrs has been commonly used since it is a shorter scan  and requires less data processing. however, mrsi is a much more efficient technique to record mr spectroscopy data since it examines multiple regions in one data acquisition. both techniques have shown significant changes in metabolite concentration in individuals with neuroaids and offer complementary information and should be used in conjunction as suggested by sacktor  <cit>  if time allows.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, during acute siv infection, changes in cho and mi were similar across brain regions while a significant decrease in naa, a marker of neuronal injury, was found in the frontal cortex only. a potential mechanism for these observations is that trafficking of infected monocytes involves all brain regions producing cellular changes  that are reflected in elevations in cho and mi. however, the data suggest that there is variable regional susceptibility to neuronal injury. with respect to clinical hiv patient management, the data from this model suggests that while the virus has global effects such as astrogliosis, cortical regions may be more susceptible to neuronal injury and merit observation, perhaps with the inclusion of clinical mrs studies. moreover, the use of neuroprotective agents may be particularly useful in the protection of cortical neuronal integrity. the siv-infected macaque model monitored with 1h mrs is an excellent tool to further delineate the precise neuropathogenic mechanisms and to help assess the value of drugs that may used as adjunctive therapy whose purpose is the maintenance of cognitive normality.
