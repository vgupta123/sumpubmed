BACKGROUND
escherichia coli strains that cause diarrhoea in humans have been divided into different pathotypes according to their virulence attributes and the mechanisms involved in the disease process  <cit> . five major groups of intestinal pathogenic strains have been established, such as enteropathogenic e. coli , enterohemorrhagic e. coli , enteroaggregative e. coli , enterotoxigenic e. coli  and enteroinvasive e. coli .

while epec is a major cause of infantile diarrhoea in the developing world, ehec is associated with foodborne outbreaks in the developed world and can cause bloody diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis  and the haemolytic uraemic syndrome  due to the elaboration of shiga toxin . more than  <dig> e. coli serotypes that produce shiga toxins  have been described  <cit> . a small number of these have been shown to be implicated in severe disease such as hc and hus in humans. a classification scheme has been established to group stec strains into the five seropathotype groups a-e depending on the severity of disease, the incidence of human infections and the frequency of their involvement in outbreaks  <cit> .

strains belonging to the epec group have been subdivided into typical and atypical epec as these differ from each other in their adherence mechanisms to human epithelial cells  <cit>  and in their evolutionary lineages  <cit> . typical epec adhere in a localized manner mediated by bundle-forming pili that are encoded by eaf  type plasmids harboured by these strains  <cit> . atypical epec do not carry eaf plasmids and most of these adhere in a localized adherence-like pattern to epithelial cells  <cit> . some epec strains share similarities with certain ehec strains in terms of their o:h serotypes, virulence genes and other phaenotypical traits  <cit> .

the chromosomally encoded locus of enterocyte effacement  which is present in both, epec and ehec strains plays a major role in their pathogenesis. the lee carries genes for the attaching and effacing phenotype promoting bacterial adhesion and the destruction of human intestinal enterocytes  <cit> . besides lee encoded genes, a large number of non-lee effector genes have been found on prophages and on integrative elements in the chromosome of the typical epec strains b171- <dig>   <cit>  and 2348/ <dig>   <cit> . in a homology-based search, all non-lee effector families, except cif, found in the typical epec strains were also present in ehec o157:h <dig> sakai strain  <cit> . on the other hand, some strain specific effectors were only present in ehec o157:h <dig>  and not in the epec strains. moreover, epec o <dig> and o <dig> strains were different from each other regarding the presence of some effector genes   <cit> .

it has been shown that ehec o157:h <dig> has evolved stepwise from an atypical epec o55:h <dig> ancestor strain  <cit> . atypical epec and ehec strains of serotypes o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig> have been found to be similar in virulence plasmid encoded genes, tir-genotypes, tccp genes, lee and non-lee encoded genes indicating that these are evolutionarily linked to each other  <cit> . the classification of these strains into the epec or the ehec group is merely based on the absence or presence of genes encoding shiga toxins   <dig> and/or  <dig>  in ehec strains, stx-genes are typically harboured by transmissible lambdoid bacteriophages and the loss of stx-genes has been described to be frequent in the course of human infection with ehec  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been demonstrated that stx-encoding bacteriophages can convert non-toxigenic o <dig> and other e. coli strains into ehec  <cit> .

a molecular risk assessment  concept has been developed to identify virulent ehec strains on the basis of non-lee effector gene typing  <cit>  and a number of nle genes such as nlea, nleb, nlec, nlee, nlef, nleg <dig>  nleg <dig>  nleg <dig>  nleh1- <dig> and ent/espl <dig> have been found to be significantly associated with ehec strains causing hus and outbreaks in humans  <cit> .

we recently investigated  <dig> ehec, stec, epec and apathogenic e. coli strains for the presence of nle genes and ehec virulence plasmid-associated genes. by statistical analysis, two clusters of strains were obtained. oi- <dig> encoded genes ent/espl <dig>  nleb and nlee were most characteristic for cluster  <dig>  followed by oi- <dig> encoded genes nleh1- <dig>  nlea and nlef. ehec-plasmid encoded genes katp, etpd, ehxa, espp, saa and suba showed only medium to low influence on the formation of clusters. cluster  <dig> was formed by all ehec  and by eight of twenty-one epec strains investigated, whereas cluster  <dig> gathered all lee-negative stec , apathogenic e. coli  and the remaining thirteen epec strains  <cit> . these findings indicate that some epec strains share non-lee encoded virulence properties with o157:h <dig> and other ehec strains. such epec strains could be derivatives of ehec which have lost their stx-genes but could also serve as a reservoir for the generation of new ehec strains by uptake of stx-phages  <cit> .

to classify strains of the epec group according to their relationship to ehec we have investigated  <dig> typical and atypical epec strains for the presence of nle-genes of o-islands oi- <dig>  oi- <dig> and oi- <dig>  as well as prophage and ehec-plasmid-associated genes. oi- <dig> encoded genes were found to be significantly associated with atypical epec strains that showed close similarities to ehec regarding their serotypes and other virulence traits. in typical epec, the presence of o-island  <dig> was significantly associated with strains which are frequently the cause of outbreaks and severe disease in humans.

the oi- <dig> encoded genes had only medium influence  on the formation of cluster  <dig> and oi- <dig> and ehec-plasmid encoded genes were of low influence . interestingly, ehec-plasmid genes ehxa , etpd , espp  and katp  were significantly more frequent in atypical epec  than in typical epec  strains .

the  <dig> atypical epec strains were divided into  <dig> different serotypes . twenty-five  strains were not typable according to their o-antigens . with the exception of five serotypes , all others were associated with one cluster only. strains belonging to classical ehec types o26:h <dig>  o103:h <dig>  o145:h <dig> and o157:h <dig>  were predominant in cluster  <dig>  . only four strains  of classical ehec serotypes grouped into cluster  <dig> . these were one avian o26:h <dig> strain , one human o103:h <dig> and two human o145:h <dig> strains .

forty  of the  <dig> serotypes encompassing atypical epec were associated with strains carrying one or more of the ehec-plasmid genes ehxa, katp, etpd, espp. ehec-plasmid genes etpd , ehxa  and espp  were significantly more frequent among strains  and serotypes  belonging to cluster  <dig> than in strains  and serotypes  of cluster  <dig> .

presence of virulence genes in stec and apathogenic e. coli strains
the  <dig> stec strains investigated in this study belonged to  <dig> different serotypes . twelve of these  were previously described from isolates of human origin  <cit> . apart from stx-genes,  <dig>  of  <dig> stec were positive for one or more of ehec-plasmid associated genes ehxa, espp and katp. none of the stec was positive for the plasmid etpd gene as for all other nle-genes investigated in this study . the  <dig> apathogenic e. coli strains belonged to  <dig> different serotypes  and were negative for all virulence markers investigated in this study .

discussion
the concept of molecular risk assessment  <cit>  has been successfully employed for grouping stec strains into those that are associated with outbreaks and life-threatening disease in humans and those which cause less severe or are not implicated in human disease. the presence of non-lee effector genes encoded by o-islands oi- <dig>  oi- <dig> and oi- <dig> has been shown to be highly associated with ehec strains that were frequently involved in outbreaks and severe disease in humans  <cit> . in a previous work, we were able to associate the presence of oi- <dig> and oi- <dig> encoded genes with an "ehec-cluster" comprising forty-four ehec strains as well as eight of twenty-one epec strains investigated  <cit> . this finding indicates that some epec strains are more related to ehec in their virulence patterns, than others.

in order to explore this relationship between epec and ehec more closely, we investigated larger numbers of strains and serotypes of typical and atypical epec for thirteen virulence genes associated with ehec o <dig> o-islands oi- <dig>  oi- <dig>  oi- <dig>  the ehec-plasmid and prophage cp-933n. genes for nleg5- <dig> and nleg6- <dig> were included since oi- <dig> specific genes were previously found to be associated with classical ehec and also with some epec strains  <cit> . the prophage cp- <dig> associated espk gene was included since its homologues were found in ehec o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig>  in atypical epec o55:h <dig> but not in typical epec o <dig> and o <dig> strains  <cit> .

our findings indicate that about half of the typical and atypical epec strains and serotypes are closely related to ehec regarding these virulence attributes . the presence of oi- <dig> encoded genes, followed by oi- <dig> were most significant for the assignment of epec to the "ehec-related" cluster  <dig> confirming data from our previous study performed on a different collection of strains  <cit> . the oi- <dig> encoded genes nleg5- <dig> and nleg6- <dig>  as well as the espk gene were not as strongly associated with cluster  <dig>  as the oi- <dig> and oi- <dig> genes. recently, the oi- <dig> associated genes adfo and ckf were reported to be present in  <dig>  of  <dig> investigated epec strains but a high variability of oi- <dig> associated orfs in epec strains was observed  <cit> . this could explain the results of our study, where the oi- <dig> associated nleg5- <dig> gene was found infrequently in all epec, whereas the nleg6- <dig> gene was frequent in atypical epec  but rarely found in typical epec  . further work is needed to define the genes of oi- <dig> that are most suitable for the molecular risk assessment of ehec and epec strains.

in our study, ehec-plasmids were associated with ehec, stec and atypical epec, but not with typical epec strains. ehec-plasmids are frequently harboured by classical ehec but also by many lee-negative stec strains  <cit> . correspondingly, ehec-plasmid encoded genes ehxa, etpd, katp and espp had only a small influence on cluster  <dig> formation, confirming results of previous studies  <cit> . in this study, ehec-plasmid genes were significantly more associated with atypical epec cluster  <dig> than with cluster  <dig> strains. the high proportion of ehec-plasmid positives among cluster  <dig> strains suggests that many of these may have derived from ehec by losing stx-genes. a loss of stx-genes was reported to occur frequently in classical ehec strains  <cit> . ehec-plasmid genes were found in 23/ <dig>  of atypical epec cluster  <dig> strains belonging to ehec related serotypes o26:h <dig>  o103:h <dig>  o145:h <dig> and o157:h <dig> . these  <dig> ehec-like strains showed the same virulence characteristics  as their homologous ehec strains.

in addition to this, there are epidemiological findings pointing to a closer relationship between "cluster 1" atypical epec and ehec strains. significantly  more typable  cluster  <dig> strains than cluster  <dig> strains belonged to serotypes  that are associated with the production of shiga toxins . only  <dig> %  of the atypical epec strains of cluster  <dig> showed o:h types  previously associated with stx-production.

typical epec were also found to split into cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> strains. cluster  <dig> was formed by typical epec serotypes o55:h <dig>  o114:h <dig>  o111:, o127:h <dig> and o142:h <dig> strains which accounted worldwide for large outbreaks in hospitals, infant wards and day nurseries with a high mortality rate  <cit> . cluster  <dig> typical epec accounted for serotypes that were more rarely associated with outbreaks, except for epec o119:h <dig>  the latter was frequently associated with infantile diarrhoea in brazil  <cit> . on the basis of these findings, a seropathotype classification for typical epec similar to those described for stec  <cit>  can be established. typical epec strains associated with outbreaks and high mortality are gathered in cluster  <dig> which is mainly characterized by the presence of oi- <dig> associated genes ent/espl <dig>  nleb, nlee. these findings are supported by two clinical studies showing that the presence of oi- <dig> encoded genes was significantly associated with diarrhoea in patients infected with atypical epec  <cit> . the function of nle-genes in pathogenesis of ehec and epec infection is only partially known  <cit> . further work is needed to explore the contribution of oi- <dig> effectors to the high infectivity and virulence of epec and ehec strains resulting in outbreaks and severe disease in humans.

it has been shown previously that the evolution of typical and atypical epec has occurred from lee positive ancestor strains and divergent phylogenetic groups of epec  and ehec  were established  <cit> . virulence genes harboured by eaf-plasmids, ehec-plasmids and stx-phages were found in phylogenetically unrelated strains indicating that these were acquired several times during evolution  <cit> . their horizontal spread to unrelated strains and the frequent loss of plasmid and bacteriophage inherited determinants makes these less suitable for identifying clones associated with high infectivity and virulence in humans. the oi- <dig> inherited nle-genes were found to be significantly associated with highly virulent cluster  <dig> strains of ehec and epec. they appear to be more stably inherited than plasmid and phage associated genes and could thus serve as an additional diagnostic tool for the reliable identification of ehec and epec infections in humans, animals and ehec contamination of food sources and the environment.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the oi- <dig> pathogenicity island is a common attribute that is significantly associated with highly virulent ehec and epec strains. of the oi- <dig> encoded genes, nleb was found as most conserved and thus presents a suitable marker for genetic screening for human virulent ehec and epec strains. horizontally transferred genetic elements such as the virulence-plasmids and phages were less significantly associated with the highly virulent clones of ehec and epec strains.
