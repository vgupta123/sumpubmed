BACKGROUND
microarrays are a valuable tool in functional genomics research. the breadth of their applications is reflected by the myriad of computational methods that have been developed for their analysis in the last decade. one popular practice is to compare expression patterns of genes by calculating correlation coefficients on expression level estimates across a set of conditions. many downstream analysis tools are based on the presence or absence of correlation in the expression profiles of genes, like the inference of co-expression  <cit> , gene regulatory  <cit>  and bayesian networks  <cit>  and the study of gene family evolution  <cit> . from a biological point of view, these approaches are useful and informative, but here we show that if care has not been taken as to how these correlations are calculated and how the reporters for each transcript are selected, incorrect conclusions can be drawn.

a gene is represented on a microarray by one or more reporters, i. e. nucleotide sequences that are designed to uniquely match its transcript, or transcripts if different splice variants exist  <cit> . affymetrix genechips are the most widely used microarray platform, and a wealth of data measured on these arrays is publicly available. affymetrix reporters are 25-mer oligonucleotides whose sequence is complementary to the intended target. each target is represented by a set of reporters, called composite sequences  <cit>  or probe set  <cit> . probe set size varies between  <dig> and  <dig>  depending on the type of array, but is the same for the majority of the probe sets within one array. the signals of these different individual reporters are combined into one expression value for the probe set in a step called summarization  <cit> .

the composition of the probe sets and the identifier of their gene transcript is contained in what is referred to as a cdf, a chip description file. affymetrix, as array manufacturer, provides this information, and thanks to the openness of their technology specification, users can also construct their own custom-made cdfs. for affymetrix' cdfs, probe set compositions are considered static and probe set annotation dynamic: with an updated annotation of a genome, the assignment of a probe set to a particular target gene can change, but never the content of its reporters  <cit> . for custom-made cdfs, this restriction is not necessary, as reporters can be arbitrarily assigned to targets.

microarray technology confronts researchers with various challenges. our understanding of transcriptomes is incomplete, and our estimates of which transcripts exist in a genome are constantly evolving. therefore, for the analysis of microarray data it is important to ascertain that a reporter does in fact measure the transcript it was intended to target when the array was designed. another concern is cross-hybridization, where transcripts other than the ones intended hybridize to a reporter. the signal that is obtained for such a reporter will be that of a combination of multiple different transcripts.

the widespread use of expression arrays encouraged different research groups to study the extent and effect of hybridization of cdna molecules to reporters with mismatches in more detail. the cardinal importance of reporter annotation was underscored by observations made and evaluation tools developed by several research groups  <cit> . dai et al.  <cit>  conducted a comparative analysis of genechip data with original and redefined probe set definitions and described a discrepancy of  <dig> to 50% difference in the lists of reported genes using various analyses. these authors provide up-to-date reporter mapping files for various types of genechips that match individual reporters to transcripts. based on the same observation of problematic reporter annotation, zhang et al.  <cit>  conducted an in-depth analysis of the reporter assignment on specific microarrays and pinpointed consistent but inaccurate signals across multiple experiments resulting from problematic reporters that are either non-specific or miss their target. they concluded that up to around 10% of the reporters on widely used arrays are non-specific in that they target multiple transcripts and another 10% miss their target.

different efforts have also aimed to model hybridization strength and extent of cross-hybridization to improve the design of high affinity reporters that are less prone to cross-hybridization  <cit> . in addition, tools have been developed to infer the extent of cross-hybridization of individual reporter sets subsequent to data analysis  <cit> .

the technical aspect of the microarray technology has also been tackled: eklund et al.  <cit>  reported that replacing crna with cdna hybridization targets substantially reduces cross-hybridization. alternative technologies to detect cross-hybridization on microarrays have also been suggested  <cit> .

wren et al.  <cit>  described a positive relationship between the observed signal and the amount of contiguous hydrogen bonds involved in duplex formation during reporter-transcript binding. okoniewski and miller  <cit>  conducted a large-scale analysis to map all interactions between reporters, probe sets and transcripts on the hgui33a array. first, a set of basic motifs were defined to identify families of interacting probe sets as in some cases a reporter can bind more than one transcript, or a transcript can bind more than one reporter. the motifs were then used to build a bipartite graph of interactions with the probe sets and transcripts as nodes and matches as edges. the authors were able to identify several hub probe sets, whose expression combines the signals of many available transcripts. a detailed investigation of the expression signals revealed that reporters targeting multiple transcripts had higher absolute expression signal than those targeting a unique transcript, and that probe sets that contain reporters with multiple matches had increased expression correlation between them.

a different approach in situ was taken by wu et al.  <cit>  for the construction of a free energy model for cross-hybridization. these authors observed a clear relationship between the known concentrations of spiked-in transcripts in different experiments and the measured signals of reporters not designed to target these specific transcripts. based on the sequences of these affected reporters, the authors constructed a free energy model to assess the sequence dependence of cross-hybridization which can be used to refine the algorithms used in reporter design.

these different studies intelligibly show that cross-hybridization is a critical concern for microarray analysis. it is clear that a reporter can bind different transcripts or that a transcript can bind to different reporters if stable, partial binding occurs or if hairpin structures are formed  <cit> . as a result, the signals of the reporters a transcript binds will be similar and correlation coefficients, calculated on these signals during downstream analysis, will be artifactual. the in situ effect of sequence similarity on expression correlation is however not known.

for this study we worked with the ath <dig> affymetrix genechip that was designed for the analysis of gene expression in arabidopsis thaliana. arabidopsis is the most commonly studied model plant organism and a wealth of high quality data has been generated with this genechip. we investigated the relationship between reporter-to-transcript sequence similarity and correlation of expression signals. we assessed the extent to which inclusion of off-target reporters in probe sets, i. e. reporters that are highly alignable to another transcript than the intended one, influences this correlation. the conventional probe set design, as defined by the manufacturer of the microarray was evaluated with respect to cross-hybridization and compared to our custom-made probe set composition.

we show that numerous probe sets on a widely used commercial array contain off-target reporters, and that inclusion of these reporters in a probe set gives rise to a signal pattern that is highly similar to that of the unintended probe set. we illustrate our findings with examples and demonstrate the effect of individual reporters through simulation. furthermore, we put forward a novel method to detect unreliable probe set to transcript hybridization events. our results show that excluding reporters that align well to another transcript diminishes this effect to a substantial extent and provides a method to pinpoint the occurrence of cross-hybridization in existing microarray datasets. we conclude from this study that reporter-to-transcript sequence alignment strength can be a source of error in studies of correlation of expression signals and that proper probe set composition is effective in minimizing the effect of cross-hybridization.

RESULTS
two definitions of probe set annotation
the ath <dig> is an affymetrix genechip for the analysis of gene expression in the premier plant model organism arabidopsis thaliana. a wealth of high quality data measured with this array is publicly available and has been widely used for various applications, such as the inference of gene co-expression networks and the study of functional aspects of the evolution of gene families  <cit>  .

for the affymetrix cdf of the ath <dig>  a probe set was assigned to a gene if nine or more of its reporters had perfect sequence identity with the gene's transcript consensus sequence. if this condition was fulfilled for multiple genes, the probe set was assigned to all of them. in this way,  <dig>  probe sets were assigned to more than  <dig>  genes. a probe set can thus contain up to eight reporters that align perfectly to another gene's transcript without being assigned to it  <cit> .

we built a custom-made cdf with alternative probe set definitions and annotations. we aligned each 25-mer reporter sequence to the predicted transcripts of arabidopsis thaliana . a reporter was assigned to a gene if it had perfect sequence identity with its transcript and did not align to any other gene's transcript with zero or one mismatches. we removed reporters that had multiple hits in the genome, and reporters that had hits in the reverse complementary direction. probe sets were defined as eight or more reporters all assigned to a particular gene's transcript. this resulted in  <dig>  probe sets with unique assignments to  <dig>  target genes. table  <dig> shows some statistics on the probe set definitions. the approach we took is highly similar to the one introduced by dai et al.  <cit> .

in those cases where their probe set annotations are based on the unigene database, dai and colleagues require perfect hits to unigene clusters and unique hits of a reporter to a genomic location. for their cdfs that are based on databases other than unigene, the rule of one transcript assignment per reporter does not apply  <cit> , so reporters can be assigned to multiple transcripts. as this is currently the case for the ath <dig> array, for which the cdf of dai et al. is based on the tair annotation, we computed a custom cdf that requires uniqueness. hence, we expect that our results can be generalized to other arrays for which dai et al. have computed cdfs with 1: <dig> reporter-target mapping, and in the future, when their ath <dig> cdf will be changed to unique 1: <dig> mapping , it could be used instead of our custom cdf.

off-target alignments
our aim was to investigate the relationship between correlation coefficients of microarray gene expression profiles and potential off-target sensitivity of reporters and probe sets. figures 1a and 1b explain our procedure of calculating the score for off-target sensitivity. for a probe set with n reporters designed to target gene x, and another gene y, we computed the alignment scores {a <dig> ...,an} of x's reporters to y's transcript sequence with needle  <cit> , a needleman-wunsch alignment  <cit>  program. a global alignment algorithm was used to align the full length of the reporter to the target while allowing for gaps and hairpin-forming. furthermore, we used an exact algorithm to ensure that the optimal alignment was reached. needle scores an identical match with a positive score of  <dig> and penalizes a mismatch score with - <dig>  the gap open penalty was set to - <dig> and gap extension penalty to - <dig> . the reporters have a length of  <dig>  so a perfectly matching reporter will have a score of  <dig>  some interesting scores are shown in table  <dig>

effect of individual reporters on probe set summaries
it may come as a surprise that a few reporters out of  <dig> can affect the summarized expression profile of a probe set to the extent that their inclusion coerces it to resemble that of another gene. to better understand how this can happen, consider the following simulated data example. assume that a gene a has a sinusoidal expression pattern over the course of  <dig> time points in an experiment. figure 5a shows the signal profiles of the  <dig> reporters of this gene's probe set, with data simulated using an established error model for microarray data  <cit> . the  <dig> reporters of a probe set b in figure 5b show random signals without any underlying trend. nine of the reporters of probe set c have identical signals as nine reporters of probe set b, while the remaining two reporters cross-hybridize with the transcript of gene a . the summarized expression values obtained by applying the median polish method  <cit>  are shown in figure 5d. interestingly, the pearson correlation between probe set a and b is - <dig> , while the correlation between a and c is  <dig> . what is the explanation for this? the rma method  <cit>  exploits the fact that sensitivity to target abundance is strongly reporter-dependent and repeatable across arrays. rma fits a model that explains the measured intensities as the product of a reporter effect and the target abundance. it estimates the model parameters, and hence the target abundance, with an outlier resistant method called median polish. these estimates can, however, be susceptible to subtle changes in the data, especially when the data from the reporters disagree, like here in our simulation  <cit> .

we also explored other summarization methods. with dchip  <cit>  for example, the effect of the two contaminating reporters is even stronger: the correlation between a and b is  <dig> , while it is  <dig>  between a and c. the statistical model that dchip uses is similar to the one of rma, however, there are differences in the variance assumptions and the robust estimation algorithm. affymetrix' mas  <dig> software uses an algorithm called one-step tukey's biweight  <cit> . this algorithm appears to be less influenced by the two off-target reporters: the correlation between probe set a and b is - <dig> , while it is - <dig>  between a and c.

CONCLUSIONS
microarrays are an important source of functional data. many inferential tools are based on the presence or absence of correlation in the expression profiles of genes, for example when inferring co-expression networks  <cit> , in the study of the evolution of gene duplicates or families  <cit>  and in the inference of gene regulatory networks  <cit>  or bayesian networks  <cit> .

different research groups have pinpointed the critical concern of cross-hybridization for microarray analysis  <cit> . dai et al.  <cit>  and zhang et al.  <cit>  highlighted problematic reporter annotation and underscored the importance of up-to-date reporter mappings. zhang et al.  <cit>  showed that about 10% of the reporters on widely-used arrays are non-specific in that they target multiple transcripts and approximately another 10% miss their target. okoniewski and miller  <cit>  constructed a network of different levels of interactions between reporters and transcripts, as some reporters are able to bind more than one transcript, and some transcripts can bind more than one reporter. in this network they were able to identify several hub probe sets that show a higher absolute expression signal of reporters targeted by multiple transcripts than those that target a unique transcript because they combine the signals of many available transcripts. moreover, their analysis revealed that probe sets whose reporters have multiple matches also show higher expression correlation with each other. wu et al.  <cit>  described a linear relationship between spiked-in concentrations and the measured signals of reporters that were not designed to target these particular transcripts.

we described a positive relationship between the correlation of microarray gene expression profiles and the off-target sensitivity of microarray probe sets, as estimated by sequence alignment of microarray reporters to off-target genes. probe sets that contain reporters that align well to off-target genes show correlated intensity values to these other genes .

in many cases, this positive relationship is likely not due to functional relatedness of the genes, but to a cross-hybridization artifact. three lines of argument support this statement: first, the positive trend is present even between gene pairs that do not share longer stretches of sequence similarity and where the reporter to off-target alignment is only based on short near-matches . second, this effect can be observed within probe sets . third, omitting reporters liable to cross-hybridization results in decreased artifactual correlation coefficients between probe sets .

different summarization methods perform differently when dealing with cross-hybridizing reporters: methods that do majority weighting of reporters, such as rma  <cit> , can become unstable when there are two disagreeing groups of reporters that are close to balancing each other and when small changes can lead to a flip of the majority from one side to the other. examples for this are shown in figures  <dig> and by simulation. simpler methods that are based on averages or trimmed averages, such as mas  <cit> , appear to be less affected by this problem, however, such methods suffer from the serious disadvantage of an overall smaller sensitivity  <cit> . the latter thus cannot be regarded as a solution for the cross-hybridization problem.

the standard probe set definition, as made available by the manufacturer of the array, affymetrix, was compared to a custom-made one. in affymetrix' definition, a probe set is a fixed set of reporters that is annotated to those genes to which a particular number of its reporters align perfectly. probe sets can contain up to a certain number of reporters with perfect sequence identity to an off-target gene. in the custom-made cdf, a probe set is a set of reporters that align perfectly and uniquely to one gene's transcript. the use of more stringent probe set mapping and annotation results in decreased artifactual correlation coefficients. this will improve the quality of downstream analysis results. our probe set definition is highly similar to the one used by dai et al.  <cit> . our results support and provide further evidence for the beneficial effect of probe set reorganization they and others  <cit>  reported.

in conclusion, off-target sensitivity is a factor that should be taken into account when doing correlation analysis from microarray data. high-quality assignment of reporters to target genes is essential for inferring genuine biological expression correlations. the correlation coefficient calculated between alignment strength and expression correlation coefficients, the metacorrelation coefficient, is a novel method to identify instances of unreliable reporter behavior.
