BACKGROUND
horizontal gene transfer , the movement of genes from one organism to another by mechanisms other than direct descent, is widespread in prokaryotes, but is thought to be rare among eukaryotes with sexual reproduction  <cit> . however, recent genome and expressed sequence tag  projects in nematodes provide strong evidence for hgt from bacteria, fungi, amoebozoa or from endosymbionts in the plant parasites meloidogyne incognita and m. hapla, fungivorous and plant-parasitic nematodes of the bursaphelenchus group, the necromenic nematode pristionchus pacificus and the filarial nematode brugia malayi  <cit> . in particular, cell wall degrading enzymes of glycosyl hydrolase families , pectate lyases and xylanases were acquired by several of these nematodes. cellulases  can be found in  <dig> different glycosyl hydrolase families, of which only ghf <dig> and ghf <dig> were found in nematodes so far  <cit> .

surprisingly, phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that cellulase genes have been acquired multiple times independently in nematodes from distinct microbial donors  <cit> . characterized cellulases from plant parasitic tylenchida  and migratory parasitic species  are from glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> . they appear to have acquired a whole ancestral ghf <dig> gene cassette consisting of the catalytic domain and the carbohydrate-binding module  <dig>   <cit> . the intronless ancestral gene from putative bacterial donors later gained introns followed by intron shifts or losses in single gene copies. the pine wood nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus, which is part of the same clade as the cyst/root-knot nematodes above, but from a distinct grouping, acquired a different family of cellulases  from fungi  <cit> . genes obtained by hgt that are central to parasitic interaction, like pectin lyase or cellulase genes have undergone expansion by gene duplication after hgt in meloidogyne hapla, m. incognita or p. pacificus  <cit> .

evolutionary theory makes a number of predictions for the successful acquisition of genes by hgt. specifically, evolutionary theory predicts that the successful integration of hgt-acquired genes into the biology of the host requires gene activity and longevity  <cit> , resulting in a number of testable, but yet unanswered questions, i.e. are genes acquired by hgt functional? how stable are these genes over evolutionary time scales and do they undergo normal or unusual turnover rates? finally, are such genes under positive selection?

to study the evolutionary history, activity and longevity of genes acquired by hgt requires a well-established phylogenetic framework at the species and family level and a number of natural isolates for intra-species comparisons. nematodes of the beetle-associated genus pristionchus fulfill these requirements as more than  <dig> strains of worldwide origin are available for the model species p. pacificus and  <dig> species of the pristionchus genus have been phylogenetically characterized  <cit> . furthermore, molecular analysis places the genus pristionchus well within the diplogastridae family  <cit> . building on this phylogenetic framework, we used, first, transcriptomics of seven pristionchus species and three additional diplogastrid species to study the evolution of cellulase genes and, second, compared individual genes in  <dig> natural isolates of p. pacificus.

here we show that species with cellulase genes in their transcriptome always exhibited cellulase activity. cellulase genes show high turnover with significant birth and death rates. the comparison of  <dig> natural isolates of p. pacificus strains from around the world suggests these high evolutionary dynamics to be associated with copy number variations and positive selection. we conclude that functional assimilation, high gene turnover and selection might represent key features of hgt events in nematodes.

RESULTS
cellulase genes in diplogastrid transcriptomes
est libraries of p. pacificus, six additional pristionchus species, and three other diplogastrids  were sequenced using the roche 454-sequence technology platform   <cit> . the datasets contained  <dig>  to  <dig>  assembled est contigs and  <dig>  to  <dig>  singletons, each. expressed gene contigs encompassing the carbohydrate-binding module  present at the c terminus of cellulases, were identified in all seven pristionchus species and a near full-length cellulase transcript was found in koerneria sudhausi   <cit> . in contrast, cellulase/cbm transcripts were not found in d. magnus and acrostichus sp. rs <dig> . the cbm of the pristionchus nematodes belonged to the cbm <dig>  family  <cit>  and differed from that of plant-parasitic nematodes, which have similarity to the bacterial carbohydrate-binding module of family  <dig>   <cit> . the cbm <dig> domains of different pristionchus species were all highly similar to each other . in contrast, in the k. sudhausi cellulase a cbm domain could not be detected and the cellulase transcripts did not show sufficient sequence similarity to the pristionchus cellulases to be included in the same multiple sequence alignments.

blastx searches of genbank, wormbase and uniref <dig> databases with pristionchus and koerneria cellulase transcript sequences encompassing the full-length cellulase domain identified them as members of the glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig>    <cit> . different sets of closest matching sequences were found. the pristionchus cellulase genes ppa-cel- <dig>  ppa-cel- <dig> and ppa-cel- <dig>  the latter not detected in the sequenced transcriptome, were most closely related to a paralogous set of duplicated genes of the slime molds dictyostelium discoideum and polysphondylium pallidum , whereas k. sudhausi genes revealed high similarity to cellulase genes of the plant-parasitic nematode aphelenchus avenae . these results of the similarity searches could be affected by skewed or insufficient sampling because matching homologues from related organisms are not yet in the databases, as has been argued by mitreva et al.  for ghf <dig> cellulase genes in plant-parasitic nematodes  <cit> . this explanation could hold for the koerneria ghf <dig> cellulase gene, which appears to be in a monophyletic clade with plant-parasitic nematodes of the phylogenetic clade  <dig>  <cit> . however, the clade  <dig> nematode koerneria is the only nematode in this clade - which encompasses diplogastridae  and rhabditidae  - to possess this ghf <dig> subclass, and no genes similar to ghf <dig> cellulases were detected in available est datasets at genbank from non-plant parasitic nematode clades or other species at intermediate phylogenetic positions .

in contrast, the pristionchus cellulases belong to a ghf <dig> subclass that is distinct from those in plant-parasitic nematodes. tracing the ghf <dig> genes of clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> nematodes and amoebozoans back to a common ancestor would require maintenance and sequence conservation of gene copies in genomes over extended evolutionary timescales and massive parallel losses of genes in most investigated nematodes and other phylogenetically related lineages of organisms during evolution. hence, two independent hgt events, one from an amoebozoan or related microorganism to an ancestral pristionchus species and a second from an unknown donor to koerneria and aphelenchus, appear to be the most likely scenario.

correlation of cellulase genes and cellulase activity
is the presence of cellulase genes in the est sequence data correlated with cellulase activity? we tested the supernatant of mixed stage cultures of all ten species in a congo red-polysaccharide interaction assay and found complete correlation with the transcriptome data  <cit> . all eight tested pristionchus and koerneria species that contain cellulase genes in their est libraries had detectable cellulase activity in the assay . in contrast, d. magnus and acrostichus sp. rs <dig> did neither show cellulase activity nor could we detect expression of cellulase genes in their transcriptomes . thus, species with cellulase genes in their transcriptome always exhibited cellulase activity, suggesting that functional assimilation of hgt acquired genes represents an important force during hgt events.

evolutionary dynamics of pristionchus cellulase genes
to study the evolutionary dynamics and turnover rates of cellulase genes, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationship of the  <dig> pristionchus ests encoding cbm <dig> domains by the maximum likelihood criterion using the alignment shown in additional file  <dig> the resulting phylogram revealed two important findings . first, the cellulase cbm <dig> gene phylogeny is highly congruent to the species phylogeny of pristionchus   <cit> . this result indicates an ancestral acquisition of cellulase genes followed by maintenance of the gene through several speciation events and subsequent divergence by point mutations during the evolution of species. the only discrepancy is presented by the p. uniformis contig <dig> , which appears to be a cellulase gene that was maintained only in p. uniformis but was lost in other pristionchus species. homologous genes in the p. pacificus genome with highest similarity to p. uniformis contig <dig>  are ppa-cel- <dig> and ppa-cel- <dig>  second, the cellulase genes evolve dynamically by gene duplications as indicated by species-specific duplicates in p. pacificus, p. sp.  <dig> and p. sp.  <dig>  respectively. in addition to lineage-specific gene duplications, putative gene deletions have occurred as exemplified by an ancestral cbm <dig> domain that is detectable in only one extant species, p. uniformis. these results suggest conspicuous evolutionary dynamics of cellulase genes in the genus pristionchus with high gene birth and death rates.

copy number variation among populations is well known from human evolution  <cit> . we wanted to know if the evolutionary dynamics of genes acquired by hgt also results in patterns of copy number variations. we selected three paralogous cellulase genes from the p. pacificus genome and compared them in  <dig> natural isolates of worldwide origin . two of the genes  are expressed in the transcriptome and are detectable by mass spectroscopy in the proteome  <cit> . for comparison, the third gene  has been selected because it could be found as a complete copy in the genome and its transcription has been demonstrated, but at too low levels to be found in the transcriptome and proteome analyses  <cit> . the analyzed parts of the genes ppa-cel- <dig>  ppa-cel- <dig> and ppa-cel- <dig> encompass  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively, with a total of  <dig>  kb of exonic sequence . while ppa-cel- <dig> and ppa-cel- <dig> were obtained from all  <dig> natural isolates, ppa-cel- <dig> could only be detected in  <dig> out of the  <dig> p. pacificus strains . the variability of ppa-cel- <dig> among the strains is low, with ≤  <dig> % nucleotide differences in pair-wise comparisons of the whole gene and ≤  <dig> % nucleotide differences in exons. at the same time, this gene is highly similar to ppa-cel- <dig> in transcript sequence and to a large part in intronic sequences with most of the splice sites being conserved between them. these results suggest that the ppa-cel- <dig> arose by recent gene duplication from ppa-cel- <dig> within the species p. pacificus. the time since its birth was too short for substantial sequence diversification and the gene itself has not yet spread through the whole population. thus, the comparison of pristionchus species and p. pacificus strains provides strong evidence for notable evolutionary turnover of cellulase genes by gene duplications and putative deletions.

*positive selection was determined using the selecton server

evidence for positive selection of ppa-cel-2
in addition to copy number variations, the evolutionary diversification of genes should result in intra-specific polymorphisms, which are either the result of non-adaptive or selective processes  <cit> . the p. pacificus collection of wild isolates of worldwide origin enables the inference of site-specific positive darwinian and purifying selection. site-specific positive darwinian should result in a ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous  substitutions higher than one at individual codons. we calculated the ka/ks ratio at each site of the cellulase proteins ppa-cel- <dig>  ppa-cel- <dig> and ppa-cel- <dig> with the help of the selecton server by using an empirical bayesian method  <cit> . sites with a ka/ks ratio ≥ <dig> in ppa-cel- <dig> were identified. a likelihood ratio test was performed between the two models, m <dig> and m8a, implemented on this platform. m <dig> considers sites under purifying selection vs. a category of sites experiencing positive or neutral selection   <cit> . m8a, which is nested in the m <dig> model, is restricted to purifying and neutral selection only   <cit> . the test showed a significance level of  <dig>  in support for the m <dig> model, which allows site-specific positive selection .

in contrast, ppa-cel- <dig> and ppa-cel- <dig> did not show any evidence for positive selection, arguing that the evolutionary forces act on individual genes with high specificity. this is also observable when comparing the degree of polymorphisms among the three genes. the highly expressed ppa-cel- <dig> gene displayed up to  <dig> % nucleotide differences in pair-wise comparisons of the whole gene and  <dig> % in exons. in contrast, the variation in ppa-cel- <dig> was considerably higher with up to  <dig> % and  <dig> % nucleotide differences in the whole gene and exons, respectively. we speculate that neutral processes underlie this variability in ppa-cel- <dig>  but not in ppa-cel- <dig>  taken together, the comparison of three cellulase genes in  <dig> natural isolates of p. pacificus indicates that different evolutionary forces act on these genes and provides evidence for positive selection acting on ppa-cel- <dig> 

evidence for intron gain after hgt
after a gene has been acquired by hgt it will assimilate to the new genomic environment, which may lead to changes in the size and number of spliceosomal introns  <cit> . consistent with this, we found that the putative donor cellulase genes in the slime molds d. discoideum and p. pallidum contain only one or two small introns of  <dig> to  <dig> bp, whereas the p. pacificus cellulase genes ppa-cel- <dig>  ppa-cel- <dig>  and ppa-cel- <dig> possess  <dig> to  <dig> introns, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . this includes several extremely small introns of a length below  <dig> bp, which are typical for p. pacificus and other nematodes  <cit> . assuming that the slime mold genes represent the ancestral state, these cellulase genes have gained up to  <dig> small spliceosomal introns. however, we want to note that in theory, it is also possible that slime molds might have lost ancestral introns.

discussion
we have shown that the diplogastrid nematode genera koerneria and pristionchus independently acquired cellulase genes by hgt from different putative donors. a detailed functional and genomic investigation in the phylogenetic framework of pristionchus reveals that all features of evolutionary significance are fulfilled, including functional activity, longevity and the action of positive selection. longevity of the transferred genes is indicated by their divergence from the donor through accumulated mutations. in addition, the resulting cellulase cbm <dig> phylogeny following hgt into pristionchus is congruent to the host taxon phylogeny, i.e. the phylogenetic pattern of the transferred genes is largely identical to the phylogeny of the genus pristionchus . thus, the original insertion of the cellulase gene occurred in an ancestral taxon and has been maintained over evolutionary time scales. during these processes, the cellulase gene became functionally integrated into the nematode's biology. five notions support this. first, the cellulase genes are transcribed. second, peptides corresponding to transcripts were identified by mass spectrometry  <cit> . third, the nematodes secrete cellulases whose enzymatic activity can be demonstrated in functional assays with supernatant of mixed stage cultures. in nature, microorganismal and plant cellulose are potential targets for nematode cellulase activity, providing new potential food sources and fitness advantages for the nematode. fourth, the cellulase genes gained introns in the host species, which are in phase with the functional open reading frame. the finding that the original open reading frames have not been disrupted by intron gain provides additional evidence for the functional assimilation of the acquired genes and for a selective advantage of active cellulase proteins in p. pacificus. fifth, the cellulase genes display high intra-genus and intra-species turnover dynamics by birth-and-death processes, accompanied by selection for certain functional genes. in conclusion, we demonstrated the functional integration of acquired cellulase genes into the nematode's biology as predicted by theory. functional assimilation, remarkable gene turnover and selection might represent key features of horizontal gene transfer events in nematodes. we speculate that hgt represents a major source for evolutionary innovation in nematodes and might have helped nematodes to invade the diversity of ecosystems, in which they can be found today, such as parasites of plants, animals, including humans.

CONCLUSIONS
predictions for successful horizontal gene transfer by evolutionary theory include, in particular, integration of the genes into the host's genome, functional activity, evolutionary longevity and positive selection of the genes. supported by a robust phylogenetic framework we examined here these predictions for cellulase genes in seven species of the diplogastrid nematode pristionchus and three other related diplogastrid genera. the following conclusions can be drawn. first, species with cellulase genes in their transcriptome always showed enzymatic cellulase activity demonstrating functional integration into the biology of the nematode. second, different cellulase genes were acquired independently by the diplogastrid nematodes koerneria and pristionchus. third, the considerable congruence of the phylogenetic profile of cellulase genes within the genus pristionchus with the phylogeny of the species indicates an ancestral gene integration event into the genome and gene longevity. forth, sequence comparisons of three selected cellulase genes in  <dig> natural isolates of the species pristionchus pacificus show notable evolutionary dynamics with elevated birth and death rates, associated with copy number variations and putative positive selection for one of the cellulase genes. thus, functional integration of acquired cellulase genes into the nematode's biology, as predicted by theory, could be demonstrated.
