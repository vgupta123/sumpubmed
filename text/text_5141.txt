BACKGROUND
the a-type receptors for γ-aminobutyric acid  mediate the majority of fast inhibitory transmission in the mammalian central nervous system. many clinically important drugs including benzodiazepines, barbiturates and general anesthetics act as positive allosteric modulators of this receptor  <cit> . gabaa receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion-channels, composed of subunits from many subunit classes: α1– <dig>  β1– <dig>  γ1– <dig>  δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1– <dig>  this produces a great heterogeneity in the receptor structures and receptor properties. the main receptor population containing the α <dig> subunit is responsible for only some, but not all, behavioral and physiological effects of gabaa receptors and, most importantly, the animals devoid of the α <dig> subunits survive without dramatic abnormalities  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that minor subtypes are also relevant in physiology and as pharmacological targets.

here, we focused our study on minor populations of novel ε and θ subunit-containing gabaa receptors. these subunits are enriched in several discrete nuclei, most remarkably in the bilateral brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus   <cit> . the ε and θ subunit genes are clustered with the α <dig> subunit gene in the chromosome xq <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a common ancestry with the three other β-α-γ gabaa receptor subunit gene clusters in other chromosomes, although the θ and ε subunits have diverged remarkably from β- and γ-like sequences  <cit> . the in situ hybridization signals of rat brain sections have shown that the lc neurons express among the α subunits, the α <dig> and α <dig> subunit mrnas, but not those of α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig> or α <dig>  <cit> , among the β subunits, the β <dig> and β <dig> subunit mrnas  <cit> , but none of the γ1– <dig> mrnas are clearly enriched in the lc neurons. in contrast to the expression profiles of the most gabaa receptor subunits, the ε and θ subunit mrnas are strongly enriched in the lc neurons  <cit> . these expression profiles suggest a likely existence at least of α3β1θ, α3β1ε and α3β <dig> receptor populations among the lc gabaa receptors, with additional roles of α <dig> and β <dig> subunits in either replacing the α <dig> and β <dig> and/or perhaps co-assembling with them .

the θ subunit has the highest sequence identity  with the β <dig> subunit  <cit> . it should hypothetically form functional receptors with α and β or α and γ subunits, but in practice it may not form functional receptors when coexpressed with an α subunit or an α and β subunit as the αβθ combination failed to respond to gaba  <cit> . thus, only little is known about the pharmacological properties of the θ subunit, and its role has not been satisfactorily studied in different receptor subunit combinations.

the ε subunit is more related to the γ subunits  <cit> . the effect of the ε subunits on the properties of gabaa receptor subtypes has been studied only in a few receptor subtypes, mostly in α <dig> subunit-containing receptors. the ε subunit-containing receptors display insensitivity to benzodiazepines and reduced efficacy for anesthetics, spontaneous channel openings, sensitivity to picrotoxin, rapid or more extensive desensitization, and this subunit has abolished the outward rectification in recombinant receptors  <cit> .

the lc is the largest noradrenergic nucleus with many projections innervating major levels of neuraxis. it plays an important role in the regulation of anxiety states, vigilance, attention and memory functions  <cit> . it has been shown that  <dig> % of the nerve terminals in the lc can accumulate gaba and that the lc neurons contain glutamic acid decarboxylase, the gaba biosynthetic enzyme  <cit> . the lc harbors a unique repertoire of gabaa receptors due to the expression of ε and θ subunits. this report describes a characterization of recombinant α3β1θ/ε receptors that most likely form major gabaa receptor populations in the lc neurons.

RESULTS
gaba-site sensitivity of recombinant human gabaa receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes
gaba elicited inward currents in α3β <dig>  α3β1γ2s, α3β1θ, α3β1ε and α3β1εθ gabaa receptors that were well distinguished from the baseline, whereas no currents were detected in the α3θε combination or the dimer α3θ combination . the gaba concentration-response curves are depicted in fig. 1a. currents were normalized to the maximal peak currents induced by gaba . gaba concentrations producing  <dig> % of the maximum efficacy  varied significantly between the receptor subtypes. the α3β1ε receptors had the highest gaba sensitivity , being 25-fold higher than in α3β <dig> and α3β1θ receptors and almost 100-fold higher than in α3β1γ <dig> receptors . the gaba sensitivity of α3β1θ receptors was not different from that of α3β <dig>  while the addition of ε subunit significantly increased gaba sensitivity and the addition of γ <dig> reduced it. when both ε and θ subunits were co-injected, the oocytes had similar ec <dig> values for gaba as the α3β <dig> receptors.

the potency of gaboxadol, a partial agonist of the gaba site  <cit> , at all tested receptor subtypes was lower than that of gaba . gaboxadol had the highest potency at the α3β1ε receptor , followed by α3β <dig> , α3β1εθ , α3β1θ  and α3β1γ <dig> receptors . since different batches of oocytes were used in fig.  <dig>  maximal currents induced by gaba and gaboxadol could not be compared. when  <dig> mm concentrations of gaba and gaboxadol were individually applied to the same oocytes, the gaboxadol-evoked currents were only about 50% of the corresponding gaba currents , suggesting that gaboxadol is a partial agonist at these receptor subtypes. more specifically in α3β1ε receptors, in which  <dig> mm concentrations of both agonists saturate the receptor , gaboxadol-induced currents were  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the gaba currents  and both agonists applied simultaneously evoked a current that was  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the gaba current alone.

ε subunit-containing receptors display leakage currents that can be blocked with picrotoxin
recombinant α3β1ε receptors exhibited spontaneous activity, which could be seen by outward currents during application of  <dig> μm picrotoxin, the gabaa receptor channel blocker, and often by the continuous drift of the baseline. figure  <dig> illustrates the effect of picrotoxin  and compares its amplitude to the inward currents induced by  <dig>  μm gaba .

θ subunit confers high efficacy for etomidate
in the presence of  <dig> μm etomidate, gaba-induced currents were  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the control gaba response for α3β <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1γ <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1θ ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1ε  and  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1εθ  receptors , indicating that the α3β1θ receptors were potentiated by etomidate the most  and the α3β1ε receptors the least . nonlinear regression fit of etomidate potentiation of gaba-induced currents revealed that etomidate had higher efficacy in α3β1θ than α3β1γ <dig> receptors , but there was no drastic difference in etomidate potency . in α3β1εθ receptors, the efficacy of etomidate was clearly reduced from that for α3β1θ receptors.

θ and γ <dig> subunits enhance propofol efficacy
in the presence of  <dig> μm propofol, gaba-induced currents were  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the control gaba response for α3β <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1γ <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1θ ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1ε  and  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1εθ  receptors , indicating that both γ <dig> and θ subunit-containing receptors were more potentiated by propofol than α3β <dig> combination . the α3β1ε receptors were hardly potentiated at all, but addition of the θ subunit to this combination increased the efficacy. nonlinear regression fit of propofol potentiation of gaba-induced currents yielded a similar potency  and maximal potentiation for α3β1γ <dig> and α3β1θ receptors .

ε and θ subunits reduce neurosteroid potency
in the presence of  <dig> μm pregnanolone, gaba-induced currents were  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the control gaba response for α3β <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1γ <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1θ ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1ε  and  <dig> ±  <dig> % for α3β1εθ  receptors, indicating that γ <dig> subunit-containing receptors were slightly more potentiated by pregnanolone than α3β <dig> receptors . nonlinear regression fit of pregnanolone potentiation of gaba-induced currents yielded remarkable differences in pregnanolone potency as α3β1γ <dig> receptors were highly sensitive and robustly potentiated by pregnanolone . the α3β1ε, α3β <dig> and α3β1θ receptors were apparently much less sensitive . the α3β <dig> and α3β1θ receptors were clearly potentiated, but there was only little neurosteroid potentiation in α3β1ε receptors. interestingly, the addition of both ε and θ subunits appears to increase the potency and reduce the efficacy as compared to α3β1θ receptors.

ε and θ subunits do not confer benzodiazepine sensitivity nor affect barbiturate modulation
benzodiazepines presumably bind to the interface between α and γ <dig> subunits  <cit> . in the presence of  <dig> mm flurazepam, gaba-induced currents were affected as follows:  <dig> ± 3% of the gaba control response  in α3β <dig>   <dig> ± 31% in α3β1γ <dig> ,  <dig> ± 3% in α3β1θ  and  <dig> ± 6% in α3β1ε  receptors. as expected  <cit> , benzodiazepine sensitivity was achieved only among the receptor subtype containing the crucial γ <dig> subunit. nonlinear regression fit of flurazepam effects on gaba-induced currents revealed ec <dig> =  <dig>  μm and maximal potentiation of  <dig> ± 21% of the gaba control response in α3β1γ <dig> receptors . possible negative modulation of ε subunit-containing receptors at low flurazepam concentrations was not statistically significant .

in the presense of  <dig> μm pentobarbital, gaba-induced currents were  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the control gaba response in α3β <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % in α3β1γ <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> % in α3β1θ  and  <dig> ±  <dig> % in α3β1ε  receptors, showing that γ <dig> subunit-containing receptors were more efficaciously potentiated by pentobarbital than other combinations , which did not differ from each other.

direct activation by etomidate and propofol
anesthetics at high concentrations are known to open the gabaa receptor ionophores also directly in the absence of gaba, i.e., without allosteric interaction with the gaba binding sites  <cit> . we used etomidate and propofol at high  <dig> μm non-saturating concentrations, and found that the α3β1ε, α3β1γ <dig>  α3β <dig> and α3β1θ receptors were all slightly activated in the absence of gaba . etomidate at  <dig> μm provoked currents from  <dig>  %  up to  <dig> %  of ec <dig> gaba control responses. propofol at  <dig> μm provoked even smaller currents ranging between  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  of the ec <dig> gaba responses. all drugs and gaba controls were applied to each oocyte. these results indicate that the effects of etomidate and propofol in the presence of ec <dig> gaba are not due to direct effects on the receptor channel, but rather due to allosteric potentiation of the gaba action.

discussion
the present data indicate that the locus coeruleus -enriched ε and θ subunits of gabaa receptors produce significant functional and pharmacological changes on the α3β <dig> receptors. these features also differentiate them from γ <dig> subunit-containing receptors. it is thus possible that the novel subunits may form receptor populations that could be selectively targeted by future drugs.

as compared to the α <dig> subunit-containing receptors, the α <dig> subunit receptors display a reduced sensitivity to gaba, which has been traced to an extracellular n-terminal domain of four amino acids within the α subunits that mediates the distinct sensitivities to gaba  <cit> . we confirmed here the very low gaba sensitivity in most of the α <dig> subunit combinations tested , the ec <dig> values for gaba being 10– <dig> times higher than those found in previous studies in recombinant α <dig> and especially α <dig> subunit-containing receptors expressed in oocytes  <cit> . however, the ε subunit confers high gaba sensitivity to the receptors, the ec <dig> for gaba being almost 100-fold lower than that for α3β1γ <dig> receptors. thus, the ε subunit makes the α3-receptors as sensitive to the natural transmitter as most other receptor subtypes are. this effect of ε subunit may be specifically dependent on the α subunit, since in α <dig> subunit-containing receptors the addition of ε does not alter gaba sensitivity  <cit> . the high gaba potency of the α3β1ε receptors was apparently reduced when θ subunit was added. however, whether all subunits were present in the same pentameric receptors in our conditions remains uncertain and awaits further experiments with linked subunits.

previously it has been shown that gaboxadol binds to and acts on all gabaa receptors with a relatively low selectivity  <cit> . more recently, gaboxadol has been suggested to affect more efficiently or potently extrasynaptically located gabaa receptors   <cit> , which are found at high concentrations in the hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum, but are also present widely in the neocortex  <cit> . gaboxadol potency and efficacy are dependent on the α subunit  <cit> . in the present study, gaboxadol had a low potency at all α <dig> subunit-containing receptors, but its potency was higher in the presence of ε subunits than with γ <dig> subunits . however, the potency variation was smaller between the subtypes with gaboxadol than with gaba, which might have something to do with the differences in intrinsic efficacies. we found high apparent efficacies for gaboxadol in most receptor subtypes , but in comparison to gaba in the same oocytes, its efficacy was lower than that of gaba at  <dig> mm concentrations. this is consistent with partial agonism of gaboxadol that has previously been shown for α3β1/2/3γ <dig> receptors  <cit> .

a feature of the ε subunit-containing receptors was the spontaneous activity of the chloride channel, which has been observed in other recombinant receptor experiments when ε is expressed with α <dig> and β subunits  <cit> . the ε subunit-containing receptors have been suggested to have higher stability of the energetically more favorable ionophore open-state position than closed-state position, functionally causing "leakage" currents  <cit> . the spontaneously active currents can be blocked by gabaa antagonists such as picrotoxin   <cit> . in line with our results with α3β <dig> receptors, agonist sensitivity has been shown to be increased with the degree of spontaneous receptor current in α1β2γ2/ε receptors . the role of constitutive receptor channel activity is still uncertain, since e.g. sergeeva and haas  <cit>  found that constitutive activity did not correlate with the expression of ε subunit mrna in cultured hypothalamic neurons. thompson et al.  <cit>  have suggested that the relative level of ε subunit expression may influence the emergence of constitutive channel activity. at least in recombinant receptors in vitro, the constitutive activity is the hallmark of ε subunit-containing receptors.

in our experiments, the ε-containing receptors were mildly, if at all, modulated by different allosteric agonists  in the presence of gaba, supporting the previous findings about benzodiazepine-insensitivity and reduced efficacy of general anesthetics at ε subunit-containing receptors  <cit> . since we applied gaba and the modulators simultaneously, part of the response at high modulator concentrations could be due to their direct effects. however, etomidate and especially propofol alone at  <dig> μm concentration caused only small responses in the absence of gaba, indicating that the main effect of these modulators was the potentiation of gaba action. spontaneous openings induced by the ε subunit may decrease the anesthetic efficacy compared to that in α3β <dig> dimer subtype, although the baseline gaba sensitivity differences were taken into account by adjusting the gaba concentrations to ec <dig> of each receptor subtype. furthermore, the addition of ε subunit even to the α1β3θ receptors that show high etomidate and propofol efficacies, reduced the efficacies of these drugs. only the barbiturate pentobarbital retained its activity in the ε subunit-containing receptors in our study. our results are in concert with those of whiting et al.  <cit>  and neelands et al.  <cit> , who found barbiturate potentiation in α1β1ε and α1β3ε combinations expressed in oocytes. however, irnaten et al.  <cit>  found the cardiac parasympathetic neurons transfected with the ε subunit to lose their pentobarbital modulation of spontaneous ipscs and pentobarbital-evoked facilitation of gabaergic currents. it should be noted that the lc neurons from the rat are sensitive to barbiturates using intracellular recording from in vitro brain slices  <cit> , indicating that the expression of ε subunits in these neurons does not make the neurons insensitive to barbiturates.

the θ subunit was clearly more silent in various receptor subunit combinations than the ε subunit. gaba sensitivity was not altered by inclusion of the θ subunit in α3β <dig> receptors. injections of the oocytes with α <dig> and θ or α <dig>  θ and ε subunit crna cocktails did not produce functional responses to gaba, although the amino acid sequence identity of the θ subunit resembles that of the β subunits  <cit> . this indicates that the θ subunit fails to fully replace the β subunits. pharmacologically the θ subunit brought about clear properties to α3β1θ receptors, the most striking being the increased efficacy of the anesthetic etomidate . this is important, since etomidate belongs to the growing number of gabaa receptor ligands the efficacy of which is largely determined by residues in the second transmembrane region of the β subunits  <cit> . etomidate is more potent and efficacious on β <dig> and β <dig> receptors than on β <dig> receptors  <cit> , which apparently explains its low efficacy in our α3β <dig> and α3β1γ <dig> receptors. our experiments should be extended to the amino acid residue level by testing whether the residue in the θ subunit , homologous tm ii region residue ser <dig> in the β <dig> subunit vs. asn <dig> in the β <dig> and  <dig> subunits  <cit> , is responsible for the altered pharmacology. this might reveal the molecular mechanisms of how θ subunits promote the actions of etomidate in β <dig> subunit-containing receptors. our finding might suggest that even β <dig> subunit-containing receptors may be partially responsible for the actions of etomidate, when the receptor also harbors the θ subunit. this could complicate the conclusions recently drawn from the studies with mouse lines having etomidate-insensitive asn-ser point-mutated β <dig> or β <dig> subunits, with the β <dig> subunit-containing receptors selectively mediating etomidate sedation and hypothermia and β <dig> subunit-containing receptors etomidate hypnosis and anesthetic immobility  <cit> . however, since the θ subunit increased only the efficacy of etomidate and failed to provide the higher potency that β <dig> and β <dig> do, the β1θ subunit-containing receptors might not have a great influence on the in vivo sensitivity to etomidate.

propofol efficacy was also high in the presence of the θ subunit, but now identical to that of the γ <dig> subunit. similar efficacy profile was found for the neurosteroid pregnanolone, but not so clearly for pentobarbital. the θ subunits are not critical for the actions of benzodiazepines, as the gaba potentiation by flurazepam did not take place in α3β1θ receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
locus coeruleus neurons express a rare repertoire of gabaa receptor subunits to form gabaa receptor subtypes with specific characteristics. our present data suggest that α3β1θ and α3β1ε receptor subtypes, expressed uniquely in the locus coeruleus, are differentially affected by benzodiazepines and anesthetics in comparison to α3β <dig> and α3β1γ <dig> receptors. this pharmacological diversity might be exploited to find subtype-selective compounds for the treatment of stress and anxiety, and for the induction of analgesia and sedation. furthermore, the ε subunit confers high transmitter sensitivity, which may make it a dominant site for physiological modulation, especially if located in receptors outside synapses.
