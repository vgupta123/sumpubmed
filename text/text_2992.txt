BACKGROUND
development of the dentition is regulated by time- and position-specific reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions . these odontogenic interactions are directed and coordinated by transcription factors, growth and signaling factors, their cognate receptors, and extracellular matrix constituents  <cit> . collectively, various combinations of molecules within these interactions determine when or where teeth develop and modulate the specifications for tooth size and shape.

noggin, wnt5a, and mfrzb <dig> genes have been shown to regulate tooth size . cai et al., using hetero-specific tissue recombination from rat molar tooth organs, demonstrated that tooth size is determined not by dental papilla mesenchymal cell number, but by intrinsic tissue-specific dental papilla mesenchymal factors  <cit> . in addition, exogenous treatment with bone morphogenic protein   <dig>  noggin, fibroblast growth factor   <dig>  and fgf <dig> does not affect tooth size, despite the observation that bmp2/ <dig>  fgf3/ <dig>  lef <dig>  and wnt5a/5b are expressed in the dental mesenchyme during the cap and early bell stages of tooth morphogenesis . the crown width of a bioengineered molar reconstructed with dissociated epithelial and mesenchymal cells through the organ germ method is correlated with the length of the contact area between the epithelial and mesenchymal cell layers  <cit> .

in conditional bmp7-deficient embryos, the maxillary incisor tooth organs are either missing or hypoplastic, and the development of the first molar tooth organs is delayed, malformed, or missing  <cit> . therefore, bmp <dig> is assumed to be an essential growth factor for tooth morphogenesis. bmp <dig> is a 35-kda homodimeric protein that is associated with a variety of signaling pathways, including the canonical smad pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase -related pathways, and the phosphoinositol 3-kinase /akt pathway . uterine sensitization-associated gene- <dig>  is a heavily glycosylated 28–30 kda secretory protein that functions as a monomer to induce signal transduction. usag- <dig> binds to the wnt coreceptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein   <dig> and lrp <dig> and inhibits wnt signaling  <cit> . lrp <dig> modulates and integrates bmp and canonical wnt signaling during tooth morphogenesis by binding to secreted usag- <dig>  <cit> . usag- <dig> expression is further restricted to the distal renal tubules, in a pattern similar to the localization of bmp <dig>  usag- <dig> is a bmp antagonist; it interacts with bmp <dig> in the developing and adult kidney and directly binds to bmp2/4/ <dig>  as assayed using co-immunoprecipitation studies  <cit> . moreover, we previously reported that usag-1-deficient mice exhibit supernumerary maxillary incisors in response to enhanced bmp signaling and that bmp signaling is modulated by wnt signaling in usag-1-deficient mice  <cit> .

based on these observations and findings, we hypothesized that bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> play important roles in tooth morphogenesis. therefore, we previously established double genetically modified mice to analyze the in vivo inter-relationships between bmp <dig> and usag- <dig>  using this model, we demonstrated that usag- <dig> inhibits bmp <dig> signaling, leading to apoptosis and degeneration of rudimentary tooth germs in maxillary supernumerary incisor formation  <cit> . moreover, we found that the tooth size in mandibular incisors of bmp <dig> heterozygous mice was altered. accordingly, in this study, we examined the effects of bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> signaling on tooth size in mandibular incisors using the f <dig> generation of mice.

methods
production and analysis of usag-1- and bmp7-lacz knock-in mice
bmp7-lacz knock-in  mice and usag1-lacz knock-in  mice were produced as previously described  <cit> . bmp7-deficient mice were embryonic lethal. day e <dig> was established as midnight prior to finding a vaginal plug.

polymerase chain reaction  amplification was performed using kod fx neo polymerase  and specific primers for genotyping.

x-gal staining
the bacterial lacz  gene in bmp7lacz/lacz  and usag1lacz/lacz  mice was knocked into the gene of interest  <cit> . frozen sections of embryos were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 2 min and stained with x-gal  twice as whole mounts and frozen sections, followed by counterstaining with nuclear fast red . for x-gal staining, embryos were incubated at 37 °c in buffer  <dig>  35 mm k4fe <dig>  2 mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  % np- <dig>   <dig>  % sodium deoxycholate, 1× phosphate-buffered saline ). we observed mandibular incisors in bmp7+/−  and usag-1+/−  mice and mandibular molars in usag-1+/−  mice at e <dig> and e <dig> 

analysis of the adult tooth phenotype
three-dimensional  computed tomography  scans  were performed using the heads of adult mice. we converted cb files to tiff files. cb files had 512 × 512 pixels,  <dig> bits, and a voxel size of x:y:z = 1:1: <dig> . next, 3d images were reconstructed and analyzed with computer imaging software   <cit> . the mandibular incisor volume was measured using the imaging software; then, to measure the cross-sectional area, mandibular incisors were cut vertically to the tooth axes at the uppermost point on the incisor alveolar rim , so as to avoid the influence of environmental factors, such as dental occlusion and tooth attrition. the cross-sectional area of the incisors was measured using imagej software. we analyzed a total of  <dig> wild-type  and  <dig> bmp7+/− samples in adult bmp7-lacz knock-in  mice at 2 months after birth, a total of  <dig> individual genotypes in adult usag1lacz knock-in  mice at 3 months after birth, and nine usag-1+/+bmp7+/+,  <dig> usag-1+/− bmp7+/+,  <dig> usag-1−/−bmp7+/+,  <dig> usag-1−/−bmp7+/−,  <dig> usag-1+/−bmp7+/−, and  <dig> usag-1+/+bmp7+/− adult f <dig> generation mice at 4 months after birth. data for volume and cross-sectional area obtained from the right and left incisors were summed.

we measured the cross-sectional area of mandibular supernumerary incisors of three usag-1−/−bmp7+/+ and six usag-1−/−bmp7+/− adult f <dig> generation mice. we used two usag-1−/−bmp7+/+ and six usag-1−/−bmp7+/− mice at 1 month after birth and one usag-1−/−bmp7+/+ mouse at 4 months after birth. the total area was measured in cases of multiple supernumerary teeth.

to evaluate the effects of bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> on the total dentition, we also measured mandibular molars. we obtained photographs of mandibular three molars of the f <dig> generation from directly above the occlusal view under a stereomicroscope and measured the projected area with imagej software using an image of a ruler taken at the same magnification. the distances between the lens and specimen were fixed. we examined unilateral mandibular molars from seven usag-1+/+bmp7+/+,  <dig> usag-1+/−bmp7+/+,  <dig> usag-1+/+bmp7+/−, and  <dig> usag-1+/−bmp7+/− adult f <dig> generation mice at 1 month after birth. because molar form usag-1−/− mice fused  <cit> , we did not measure these molars.

brdu immunostaining
cell proliferation was detected by brdu immunostaining  according to the manufacturer’s specifications. we made a working solution of brdu in pbs at 1 mg/ml and injected the mice intraperitoneally with 1 ml of the brdu solution. after 2 h, the mice were sacrificed, and the heads of the embryos were removed and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight. paraffin sections  were then created. background tissue was stained with hematoxylin for 5 s. we counted approximately 500– <dig> nuclei under a light microscope, and the labeling index was determined as / <dig> 

detection of apoptosis
apoptotic cells in situ were detected by the tunel method using an apoptag plus in situ apoptosis detection kit-fluorescein  according to the specifications of the manufacturer.

for paraffin-embedded sections, embryos were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in pbs overnight. after fluorescent staining, the sections were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear staining .

statistical analysis
data are presented as the means ± standard deviations. statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance  with the statistical program r. gaussian distributions were determined by the anderson darling normality test.

in adult bmp7-lacz knock-in mice,  <dig> wt samples and  <dig> bmp7+/− samples collected from mice at 2 months after birth were analyzed. we calculated the mean volume and area of the right and left incisors. statistical significance was determined by unpaired one-tailed t-tests for volume and by mann–whitney u tests for cross-sectional area.

in adult usag1-lacz knock-in mice,  <dig> samples of individual genotypes at 3 months after birth were analyzed as stated above. statistical significance was determined using kruskal-wallis and steel-dwass tests for multiple comparisons in volume and by one-way anova using a games howell test for multiple comparisons in cross-sectional area.

in the adult f <dig> generation, we examined nine usag-1+/+bmp7+/+,  <dig> usag-1+/−bmp7+/+,  <dig> usag-1−/−bmp7+/+,  <dig> usag-1−/−bmp7+/−,  <dig> usag-1+/−bmp7+/−, and  <dig> usag-1+/+bmp7+/− mice, as mentioned above. statistical significance was determined by one-way anova using a games howell test for multiple comparisons.

in the analysis of mandibular molars in the adult f <dig> generation, statistical significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed t-tests .

finally, for analysis of cell proliferation using brdu staining in the mandibular incisors in bmp7-lacz knock-in mice at e <dig> and analysis of mandibular supernumerary incisors in the adult f <dig> generation, statistical significance was determined using mann–whitney u tests. for analysis of cell proliferation using brdu staining in the mandibular incisors in usag1-lacz knock-in mice at e <dig>  statistical significance was determined using kruskal-wallis and steel-dwass tests for multiple comparisons.

we used a generalized linear model  to examine the effects of respective genes and genotypes on tooth size. the model formula of the glm was “tooth size = usag-1 + bmp7”. we did not consider interactions. from this analysis, we found that bmp7+/− was associated with an increase in tooth size, whereas usag-1+/− was associated with a decrease in area . the error structure of the response variable followed a gaussian distribution. the link function was a linear model. the explanatory variable was categorical data. we used genotypes as the categorical data.table  <dig> a generalized linear model to analyze adult tooth size. the response variable is the total area of the occlusal surface of the molars of the f <dig> generation at 1 month after birth

next, a glm was used, as described in the methods. usag-1−/− and bmp-7+/− were associated with increased tooth size, whereas usag-1+/− was associated with decreased tooth size . this analysis confirmed that bmp7+/− was most strongly associated with an increase in tooth size.table  <dig> a generalized linear model to analyze adult tooth size. the response variables are volume and cross-section of the mandibular incisors of the f <dig> generation at 4 months after birth

analysis of cell proliferation using brdu staining of the mandibular incisors at e15
in murine incisors and molars, tooth eruption and tooth root formation are completed by about p <dig> or p <dig>  the cap stage and early bell stage are considered equal to the morphogenetic phase. during the early bell stage, only the labial epithelium gives rise to the enamel-forming ameloblasts in mandibular incisors  <cit> . murine incisors are continuously growing; however, bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> are not expressed in enamel epithelial stem cells in adult mice  <cit> .

therefore, we investigated cell proliferation by brdu staining in the mandibular incisors at e <dig>  during the early bell stage. the tissues of the mandibular incisors at the early bell stage were categorized as vestibular lamina, stellate reticulum, dental papilla, labial mesenchyme, lingual mesenchyme, labial cervical loop, and lingual cervical loop . the labeling index of bmp7+/− embryos was significantly higher than that of wt embryos in the cervical loop . additionally, the labeling index of usag-1−/− embryos was significantly higher than that of wt and usag-1+/− embryos in dental papilla . the labeling index of wt embryos was significantly higher than that of usag-1+/− embryos in stellate reticulum .fig.  <dig> brdu immunostaining and detection of apoptosis in mandibular incisors at e <dig>  a–j analysis of proliferation using brdu staining in mandibular incisors at e <dig>  a sagittal section of mandibular incisors  of wt mice. b schematic diagram. vl: vestibular lamina, sr: stellate reticulum, dp: dental papilla, lam: labial mesenchyme, lim: lingual mesenchyme, lac: labial cervical loop, lic: lingual cervical loop. c–f sagittal section of cervical loop .  sagittal section of dental papilla . j analysis of cell proliferation using brdu staining in mandibular incisors of wt and bmp7+/−  mice at e <dig>  percent labeling index in respective tissues of wt and bmp7+/− e <dig> embryos are shown. labeled cells were counted under 1000× magnification. we counted approximately  <dig> nuclei under a light microscope and determined the labeling index as:  /  <dig>  data are the mean + standard deviation . ns: not significant, *p <  <dig>  by mann–whitney u test. k analysis of cell proliferation using brdu staining in mandibular incisors of usag-1+/+, usag-1+/− and usag- <dig> −/−  mice at e <dig>  percent labeling index of mandibular incisors of usag-1+/+, usag-1+/− and usag-1−/− embryos at e <dig>  data are the mean ± sd. ns: not significant, *p <  <dig>  by steel dwass test. l tunel staining in mandibular incisors of bmp7+/− , usag-1−/− , usag-1−/−bmp7+/− , and usag-1+/−  mice at e <dig>  under 100× magnification, the developing bone and cartilage  are shown. under 200× magnification, meckel’s cartilage , epithelium near the oral cavity , and the mesenchyme near the tooth germ  are shown. all bars: 100 μm

next, we investigated the occurrence of apoptosis in cells in the mandibular incisors of bmp7+/− , usag-1−/− , usag-1−/−bmp7+/− , and usag-1+/−  embryos at e <dig> . apoptotic cells were detected near meckel’s cartilage, the developing bone and cartilage, the epithelium near the oral cavity, and the mesenchyme near the tooth germ . few apoptotic cells were observed in the tooth germ for all genotypes. in the early bell stage, apoptosis was not associated with the determination of tooth size.

analyzing mandibular supernumerary incisors in the adult f <dig> generation
in the f <dig> generation, the size of supernumerary incisors of usag-1−/−bmp7+/− mice was larger than that of usag-1−/−bmp7+/+ mice . moreover, the total area of mandibular supernumerary incisors of usag-1−/−bmp7+/− mice was significantly larger than that of usag-1−/−bmp7+/+ mice .

discussion
the expression levels of usag- <dig> and bmp <dig> are opposing in the region near the rudimentary incisor tooth primordia between the maxilla and mandible  <cit> . moreover, in several types of genetically modified mice, the dental phenotype differs between the maxilla and mandible  <cit> . for example, in usag-1-deficient mice, supernumerary teeth are observed in 100 % of the maxillary incisor regions, whereas partial penetrance is observed in the mandible  <cit> . thus, the genetic controls for tooth organ size and shape play critical roles in tooth regeneration. in this report, we demonstrated that the sizes of mandibular incisor and molar tooth organs in bmp7+/− mice were significantly larger than those of wt mice. in contrast, the sizes of incisors and molars were significantly smaller in usag-1+/− mice than in wt mice, and the volume and cross-sectional areas in usag-1−/−, mice were significantly larger than those of all other genotypes. thus, our results demonstrated, for the first time, that bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> heterozygous mice exhibited changes in tooth size.

in conditional bmp7-deficient embryos, the maxillary incisors have been shown to be missing or hypoplastic  <cit> . thus, the phenotypes of usag- <dig> heterozygous mice and bmp <dig> heterozygous mice were opposite those of usag-1-deficient mice and bmp7-deficient mice, respectively. our results suggested that the levels of bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> expression in heterozygotes did not reach the threshold level necessary for normal tooth morphogenesis, that is, the embryos exhibited haploinsufficiency. furthermore, heterozygotes may exhibit changes in downstream gene expression, resulting in changes in tooth size. global analysis of gene expression in heterozygotes, such as microarray analysis and next-generation sequencing, is needed in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in these processes.

the expression level of bmp <dig> was similar to those of wnt5a and mrfzb <dig> and was localized adjacent to usag- <dig> expression in the dental mesenchyme. usag- <dig> is a bmp <dig> antagonist; however, the effects of bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> were additive within the mandibular incisors of the f <dig> generation. brdu assays confirmed that cell proliferation was increased within the cervical loop in association with larger sized mandibular incisors in bmp7+/− embryos. furthermore, we confirmed that the increased cell proliferation of dental papilla mesenchymal cells was associated with larger mandibular incisors in usag-1−/− embryos. importantly, apoptosis was not associated with tooth size at e <dig>  these data indicated that there was a difference in the mechanisms of action of bmp <dig> and usag- <dig> during the cap or bell stages of tooth morphogenesis. continuous growth and enamel deposition in incisors can be modulated by the levels of fgf3/ <dig>  activin, and bmp2/4/ <dig> mesenchymally expressed in the epithelial stem cell niche  <cit> . thus, we concluded that elongation of the cervical loop in bmp7+/− embryos at e <dig> enlarged the incisors and that bmp <dig> expressed in the mesenchyme around the cervical loop had distinct local effects on the loop.

the volume and cross-sectional area were largest in usag-1−/− mice, and the labeling index of the dental papilla in usag-1−/− mice was highest of all genotypes examined. we have also reported that phosphorylated smad1/5/ <dig> levels are increased and that β-catenin is localized in the nucleus in odontogenic mesenchymal cells within the maxillary rudimentary incisor tooth organ in usag-1-deficient embryos  <cit> . using organ culture of wt and usag-1-deficient mandibular incisors, munne et al. demonstrated that usag- <dig> expression is limited to the mesenchyme and that the dental mesenchyme may limit supernumerary tooth induction resulting from activated wnt signaling, thereby minimizing the amount of mesenchymal tissue surrounding the incisor tooth germs prior to culture  <cit> . usag- <dig> is downstream of sonic hedgehog  signaling; therefore, a wnt-shh-sostdc <dig> negative feedback loop may control the spatial patterning of teeth, and wnt, shh, and sostdc <dig> may act as the activator, mediator, and inhibitor, respectively, in reaction–diffusion models  <cit> . consistent with this, patients with supernumerary teeth have larger teeth than controls in humans  <cit> . thus, these findings, combined with our new results, suggest that enhanced bmp- and wnt-mediated signal transduction in the dental mesenchyme of usag-1−/− mice may increase the proliferation of cells in the dental mesenchyme at the cap or early bell stages, resulting in increased tooth size and formation of supernumerary teeth.

the size of a tooth is determined not only by genes related to tooth development but also by the development of the mandible. the size of mandibular incisors is altered by craniosynostoss in the apert fgfr2s252w mouse model  <cit> . importantly, in our study, we found no significant difference in the linear distance of the anteroposterior diameter and altitude between respective genotypes in bmp7-lacz knock-in mice at 2 months of age . however, at 3 months of age, usag-1−/− mice exhibited a significantly longer linear distance of the anteroposterior diameter and altitude compared with that in wt and usag-1+/− mice . the development of the mandible in the context of usag- <dig> deficiency may be associated with changes in the size of the mandibular incisor and molar in usag-1−/− mice. these results suggested that we may be able to control the size of teeth by regulating the gene expression level locally in humans when dental epithelial stem cells, such as third dentitions and outer enamel epithelium, are used for tooth regeneration in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings showed that bmp <dig> heterozygous mice exhibited dramatic increases in tooth size and that tooth size was controlled by the expression levels of specific genes.
