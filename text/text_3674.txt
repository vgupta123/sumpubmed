BACKGROUND
mus booduga  and mus terricolor blyth,  <dig> are the indigenous pygmy field mice of india and are highly interesting for evolutionary studies. they are morphologically alike and were considered conspecific until matthey and petter  <cit>  discovered that they were two sibling species, primarily based on their divergent karyotypes. these co-existing, sibling species are closely allied to the house mouse mus musculus belonging to a sister lineage. they are found in abundance in cultivated fields being a major pest infesting mainly rice and wheat fields. these field mice have 2n =  <dig> chromosomes as in other mus species. m. booduga has the same karyotype throughout its distribution with all acrocentric chromosomes in the complement, identical to that of m. musculus. the karyotype of m. terricolor, on the other hand, is distinct due to the presence of large submetacentric x and large acrocentric y chromosomes. in addition, different apparently non-overlapping populations of m. terricolor possess divergent karyotypes showing variation in the number of autosomal heterochromatic large short arms established in homozygous condition  <cit> . a multidimentional investigation carried out over the years in our laboratory at varanasi revealed recency of evolutionary differentiation of the three chromosomal species of m. terricolor which however have developed both pre-mating and almost complete post-zygotic isolations  <cit> .

we have earlier analysed  <dig> enzymatic and nonenzymatic loci in mus booduga-terricolor complex as well as mus musculus tytleri  <cit>  for genetic variations. among  <dig> loci only three loci  showed adaptive correlation. we have observed direct correlation of the difference in preference for sites for burrows in the fields and difference in depth of burrows and nest chamber position in the burrows of m. booduga and m. terricolor to the fixation of alternative alleles at three loci hemoglobin beta-chain , transferrin  and superoxide dismutase  . the fixation of alternative alleles at these three loci, and the differences in their burrow patterns and location probably reflect adaptive strategy difference between the co-existing, sibling species.

RESULTS
the season of breeding of both m. terricolor and m. booduga coincided with the harvesting of major crops, namely, rice and wheat. in southern india, where the difference in climatic conditions in summer is less-marked compared to other seasons, and availability of the crops is fairly continuous, breeding was observed almost throughout the year. in the north however, these mice were hardly traceable in the parched fields during hot summer months, but they were in abundance when rice and wheat were harvested in october/november and march/april. these pygmy field mice remain in burrows during day time and come to surface only at nights in search of food and mates.

burrow study
a characteristic feature of live burrows was the presence of small mounds of minute damp soil pellets at the entrance. larger mounds were seen at the entrance of breeding or family burrows with pups. pups were found in globular nests padded with dried grass and straw. a study of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> litter of m. terricolor i, ii and iii, respectively showed that the litter size varied from  <dig> to  <dig> with a mean of  <dig>  seven litters of m. booduga were examined and were found to be similar in size as in m. terricolor.

the presence of mice in burrows could be ascertained by the degree of freshness or wetness of pellets at the entrance. the entrance and particularly the exit of the burrows were camouflaged making them fairly inconspicuous. it was striking that m. terricolor constructed their burrows in the raised earthen mounds or bunds built for holding water in cultivated fields. the m. booduga burrows, on the other hand, were located in flat portions of the fields. the difference for preference of site for making burrows was found in northen as well as southern india. a total of  <dig> burrows of m. booduga  and  <dig> burrows of the m. terricolor complex  were excavated and studied. the burrows of m. booduga and m. terricolor had similarities in diameter  of inlet and outlet tunnels, diameter  of nest chamber, number of storage cell  and in having a single entrance .

the burrows of m. terricolor i, ii and iii showed more or less similar measurements and other features in different soil-types from northern and southern india. it was interesting that m. terricolor seem to prefer moist soils, and often one would come across tunnel of crabs by the side of m. terricolor burrows . the average lengths of the inlet and outlet tunnels were almost equal being  <dig> cm  and  <dig> cm  respectively. the nest chamber was at an average  <dig> cm  from the top surface which was markedly less deeper compared to the nest chamber in m. booduga burrows which was at an average depth of  <dig> cm  in the alluvial and deltaic soils in the north and at  <dig> cm  in the red and coastal alluvial soils in the south. the burrows in northen india therefore had longer and deeper tunnels; the inlet and outlet tunnels being  <dig> cm  and  <dig> cm  as compared to shallower  <dig> cm  and  <dig> cm  ones in southern india . analysis of variance  shows high f-values indicating significant difference among taxa with respect to lengths of inlet and outlet tunnels and the depth of the nest chamber . thus, the difference in location of the burrows and in position of the nest chamber, , would affect concentration of o <dig> and co <dig> in the nest chambers of their burrows.

besides the family burrows with females and pups, much simple burrows were also found which were occupied only by adult male. excavation of  <dig> such burrows of both m. terricolor  and m. booduga  showed that these had no separate outlet tunnels, storage cell or blunt-end tunnel. the inlet tunnel of each species ended in a chamber resembling the nest chamber, but without bedding. the inlet tunnel was running downward from the entrance in case of m. booduga burrows whereas it was running upward in m. terricolor burrows. the sites for the male burrows were as for the family/breeding burrows.

electrophoretic analysis
the sample size studied for the three loci sod- <dig>  trf and hbb varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  the allelic frequencies were  <dig>  for the allele sod-1a in all the three chromosomal species m. terricolor i, ii and iii  and  <dig>  for the alternative allele sod-1b, which was markedly anodal, in m. booduga . in m. booduga the frequency of trfa, which was much more anodal to trfc and trfd was  <dig>   and of trfb it was  <dig> . the frequencies were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for trfc and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for trfd in m. terricolor i, ii and iii respectively . for heamoglobin beta chain , in m. terricolor i, ii and iii, only allele hbbp was present , but in m. booduga the frequency of hbbp was very low being  <dig>  whereas it was  <dig>  for hbbb .

discussion
there are reports on nest construction in various mus species mostly under laboratory conditions but very few in natural environments . nest ranges from a simple pallet to a spherical enclosed type and the burrow structures vary from a simple system of m. m. musculus, m. m. domesticus and m. m. molossinus with shallow burrows of 18â€“ <dig> cm to that of m. m. hortulanus which has the most complex of all mus species with its nest chamber  <dig> to  <dig> cm deep in soil. the burrows of the co-existing m. booduga and m. terricolor are particularly interesting because of their site of construction. the position of the entrance and exit of the burrows of m. booduga is located at the highest level while their nest is at the lowest level . on the other hand, m. terricolor i, ii and iii have their nest at the highest level and the entrance and exit at the lowest level of the burrow . this difference is due to their location .

low o <dig>  and high co <dig>  conditions have been reported in the occupied burrows of rodents, e.g., spalax and geomys  <cit>  and also converging points of evidence show adaptive mechanisms of spalax to the extreme conditions of hypoxia in its subterranean environment  <cit> . in the burrows of the indian pygmy field mice too relatively less o <dig> and more co <dig> could be present which would vary with depth, since it is known that proportion of o <dig> decreases and co <dig> increases with increase in depth below ground level  <cit> . since post-partum mating takes place in these mice, in the breeding season in the nest chambers litters of different age groups are often found in both m. booduga and m. terricolor burrows. it is quite common that suckling females are already gravid. increase in the number of individuals in the nest chambers would further affect o <dig> and co <dig> concentrations. the nest chambers are located at greater depth in m. booduga compared to that of m. terricolor and exchange of air takes place from only one surface  in the m. booduga burrows built in flat fields. in the m. terricolor burrows, on the other hand, exchange of air takes place from three sides of the raised mounds or bunds where they build their burrows. these differences should affect o <dig> and co <dig> levels and consequently, the burrows and nest chambers of m. terricolor would be relatively more aerated than that of m. booduga. apparently, m. booduga lives in more hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions compared to m. terricolor types i, ii and iii. f-values obtained by anova also indicate significant difference in the burrow dimensions. interestingly, very high f-value for depth of the tunnel  supports significant difference in the level of depth of burrows of m. budooga and m. terricolor reflecting difference in hypoxic/hypercapnic conditions among burrows.

hypoxic/hypercapnic conditions known to be lethal to other mammals had no visible effect on these indian pygmy field mice as also reported in case of subterranean mole rats. however, the evidence shows structural differences in molecules related to hypoxic tolerance like hemoglobin, myoglobin, erythropoietin, vegf, etc. in subterranean mole rats spalax  <cit> . also, evidence from a number of high-altitude vertebrates viz., north american deer mice  living in hypoxic conditions indicates that modifications of hemoglobin function typically play a key role in mediating an adaptive response to chronic hypoxia  <cit> .

interestingly, the electrophoretic analysis in the present study showed difference in mobility and fixation of alternative alleles at three loci hbb, trf and sod- <dig> that are directly or indirectly dependent on oxygen concentration for function, between sibling species m. booduga and m. terricolor. in m. booduga the fixed alleles of all the three loci are of faster mobility. an increased anodal mobility of the major component of hbb has been reported which is associated with increased oxygen affinity  <cit> . in the serum faster migrating transferrin binds more iron atoms than the slower transferrin, and iron is one of the important components of hemoglobin  <cit> . superoxide radical anion is formed even as a normal product of the biological reduction of molecular oxygen. the superoxide dismutase protects organisms against oxygen toxicity by catalyzing dismutation of the reactive radical to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. peng et al.,  <cit>  have shown in x-irradiated drosophila melanogaster that the allele of slow mobility  had higher enzyme activity which provided more protection against radiation damage than allele of fast mobility . their results further indicated a possible adaptive role of the polymorphism  found in natural populations of d. melanogaster. if this could be extrapolated, the allele of faster mobility  present in m. booduga may presumably be adapted to an environment with less oxygen in their nests and burrows. working on the subterranean system spalax, israeli scientists at university of haifa are now focusing on whether these rodents could help understand and treat human diseases involving hypoxia  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
thus, location, structure and depth of the burrows might have been the contributory factors for selection of alternative alleles at three loci sod- <dig>  trf and hbb , which reflect differences in probable adaptive strategy in m. booduga and m. terricolor. the burrows of the non-overlapping chromosomal species m. terricolor i, ii and iii are however the same which could be due to recency of their evolutionary divergence, but more so because of lack of competition for the well-adapted 'microhabitats' as they are non-overlapping in distribution, unlike between the co-existing, sibling species m. booduga and m. terricolor which exhibit mutual "exclusion" of the 'microhabitats' for burrow construction.

further, understanding the biochemical mechanisms that enable the subterranean rodents to survive and function under conditions of hypoxic stress can provide important insights into the nature of physiological adaptations. the indian pygmy field mice are a unique model system to study molecular mechanisms for adaptation to hypoxia. the importance of adaptation to hypoxia in understanding the behavior of several biological systems is coming to the fore.
