BACKGROUND
the genus fusarium includes a large group of phytopathogenic fungi, each having a different or partially overlapping host range. f. graminearum is an important pathogen on wheat, barley and maize, causing fusarium head blight
 <cit> , while f. verticillioides mainly infects maize, causing rot and wilting
 <cit> . in contrast, f. oxysporum causes disease on more than  <dig> different plant species, but specific strains usually infect only a single host species
 <cit> . this has led to the introduction of the forma specialis concept in f. oxysporum, where strains are categorized according to the host plant they infect, such as tomato or banana
 <cit> . in addition, some strains of f. oxysporum may also cause infections in humans
 <cit> . genomic sequences of several fusarium species have been generated, including f. graminearum , f. verticillioides , f. pseudograminearum , f. solani , f. fujikuroi  and f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strain  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> different f. oxysporum strains, including pathogens from different hosts as well as a biocontrol strain have been sequenced
. genome comparisons showed that chromosome xii of f. fujikuroi is absent in the genome sequence of related species f. verticillioides, while  <dig> and 820 kb genome sequences at both ends of chromosome iv of f. verticillioides are absent in f. fujikuroi <cit> . comparing the genome of f. pseudograminearum with f. graminearum showed that  <dig> % of genomic sequence could be aligned at >70% nucleotide identity
 <cit> . strikingly, f. oxysporum  <dig> includes  <dig> core chromosomes and four lineage-specific  chromosomes. ls chromosomes are specific to f. oxysporum strain  <dig> and have no collinear chromosomes in either f. graminearum, f. verticillioides or other f. oxysporum strains. the ls chromosomes in f. oxysporum  <dig> are suggested to have resulted from horizontal transfer from unknown sources
 <cit> . on ls chromosome  <dig>  several effector-encoding genes have been identified that facilitate infection of its host plant
.

in contrast to the high number of chromosomes present in f. verticillioides , f. oxysporum  and f. fujikuroi , f. graminearum has only four chromosomes, which probably resulted from fusions of ancestral chromosomes
 <cit> . comparing the genome of f. graminearum isolate ph- <dig> with f. graminearum isolate gz <dig> revealed several regions with high snp density
 <cit> . in addition, comparison of the genome of f. graminearum with the closely related species f. verticillioides and f. oxysporum revealed several non-conserved regions
 <cit> . further analysis showed that high snp density regions match with non-conserved regions. although many of the genes specifically expressed during plant infection are enriched in non-conserved regions
 <cit> , the origin and the biological relevance for these non-conserved regions are still largely unknown. in this study, we explored rna-seq data from both conidia and mycelium of f. graminearum to investigate the putative effect of gene locations  on their expression patterns. in addition, by comparing the genome of f. graminearum with those of f. verticillioides and f. oxysporum, we show a possible mechanism for the generation of non-conserved regions.

RESULTS
synteny block analysis between the genomes of fusarium graminearum, f. verticillioides and f. oxysporum.

to identify collinear regions on the chromosomes of f. graminearum  and f. verticillioides , we performed synteny block analysis presented in figure 
 <dig>  this analysis revealed that f. graminearum chromosome  <dig>  is largely collinear with f. verticillioides chromosomes   <dig>   <dig> and 8; fgchr  <dig> is collinear with fvchrs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 11; fgchr  <dig> is collinear with fvchrs  <dig>   <dig> and 7; while fgchr  <dig> is largely collinear with fvchrs  <dig> and  <dig> . these major collinear regions between chromosomes indicate that the four f. graminearum chromosomes were likely formed primarily through end-to-end joining of two to four smaller ancestral chromosomes, descendants of which still exist in f. verticillioides. similar collinear patterns were observed when comparing the genome of f. graminearum with those of f. oxysporum . in addition to these major collinear regions, translocations and inversions of many chromosomal segments are observed in the chromosomes of f. graminearum. for instance, the first half of fgchr  <dig> is homologous to fvchr  <dig>  but the order of genomic sequences on fgchr  <dig> is different from fvchr  <dig>  some chromosomal regions are translocated to new positions, while some are inversed . in addition, thirteen non-conserved regions, which were designated nc1-nc <dig>  were found on the four chromosomes of f. graminearum. these non-conserved regions exhibit almost no synteny with the chromosomes of f. verticillioides . notably, although the second half of fgchr  <dig> shows collinearity with fvchrs  <dig> and  <dig>  a large number of small synteny blocks was identified, indicating multiple rearrangements in this part of chromosome  <dig> . similar chromosome rearrangement patterns were observed when the chromosomes of f. graminearum were compared with those of f. oxysporum  <dig> . we also performed synteny block analysis between f. oxysporum and f. verticillioides. consistent with the notion that f. oxysporum and f. verticillioides are more closely related to each other than to f. graminearum, the collinearity between f. oxysporum and f. verticillioides was much higher .figure  <dig>

gene expression analysis on individual chromosomes of f. graminearum
to investigate a possible correlation between chromosome rearrangements and gene expression patterns on each chromosome of f. graminearum, we performed rna-seq analysis on mycelium of wild-type isolate ph- <dig> grown in nutrient-rich medium. three biologically independent replicates were conducted. in total,  <dig> , <dig> rna-seq reads were mapped against the four chromosomes and the expression level of each chromosome was evaluated by using rpkm  values. the averaged expression levels of genes on chromosome  <dig> are significantly higher than other chromosomes, while the expression levels of genes on chromosome  <dig> are significantly lower . subsequently, we evaluated the expression levels of all predicted genes of f. graminearum  and divided them into five categories based on their rpkm values: rpkm  <dig>  rpkm 0– <dig>  rpkm 1– <dig>  rpkm 10– <dig> and rpkm > <dig>  the proportion of each category on each chromosome was calculated. as expected, the proportion of weakly expressed genes  is higher on fgchr  <dig>  than on the other chromosomes  , while the proportion of highly expressed genes  on fgchr  <dig>  is lower than that on the other chromosomes . box plot analysis also showed that relatively more weakly expressed genes  are located on fgchr  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

.  the expression levels of genes on each chromosome were quantified by the number of reads per kilobase per million reads mapped. genes on chromosome  <dig> showed relative low expression levels. different letters represent statistically significant differences .  all genes of f. graminearum were grouped into five classes according to their rpkm values , and the proportion of each class was calculated for each chromosome.  box plot analysis of gene expression on each chromosome. the expression of each gene was quantified by its rpkm value. log2-transformed rpkm values were used to draw a box plot graph for each chromosome.



detailed analysis of chromosome regions with weakly expressed genes in f. graminearum
to identify positional differences in gene expression, we divided each chromosome into 20 kb windows and for each window the log2-transformed read coverage was used to quantify the expression level. this analysis demonstrated that on fgchr  <dig>  two large regions, nc <dig>  and nc <dig>  exhibited significantly lower expression levels   when compared with other parts of the same chromosome or with other chromosomes. in addition, four regions on fgchr  <dig>  three regions on fgchr  <dig> and three regions on fgchr  <dig> showed significantly lower gene expression levels. these gene expression patterns were observed for each of three biologically independent replicates . subsequently, we determined the number of genes in each of the 20 kb windows. interestingly the regions with weakly expressed genes showed slightly higher gene density . these data demonstrate that the expression of genes is not equally distributed across the chromosomes of f. graminearum and that the lower expression is not caused by a lower gene density in these regions.figure  <dig>

low-expression regions coincide with non-conserved regions
detailed inspection showed that regions with low levels of expression correspond to non-conserved regions of f. graminearum . this was further analyzed by comparing genes predicted in the genome of f. graminearum to all the genes in f. verticillioides using blastn . for  <dig> genes in f. graminearum, conserved genes were found in f. verticillioides , while for  <dig> genes in f. graminearum, no conserved ortholog in f. verticillioides was identified . when calculating the number of non-conserved genes in each 20 kb window, we found that non-conserved genes are more abundant in chromosomal regions, where genes are weakly expressed . this indicates that the regions with weakly expressed genes coincide with the non-conserved regions in f. graminearum. in addition, genes that are not expressed in nutrient-rich medium are enriched in non-conserved regions .

to investigate whether non-conserved genes show lower levels of expression, the expression levels of all conserved and non-conserved genes were categorized according to their rpkm values. on each chromosome, the conserved genes showed much higher gene expression levels than non-conserved genes . furthermore, we categorized the genes of f. graminearum into five groups according to the p value of the predicted genes in the blast analysis using the predicted genes of f. verticillioides as a reference . compared to the other three chromosomes, fgchr  <dig> contains a higher proportion of non-conserved genes  . in addition, a strong correlation between the degree of gene conservation and gene expression level was observed , as genes with high similarity to their homologs showed relatively higher expression levels, while genes with less similarity to their homologs showed relatively lower expression levels. to specifically demonstrate this phenomenon the expression levels of all  <dig> transcription factors, previously identified by son et al. <cit>  were analyzed. as observed for the expression levels of all genes, the expression levels of genes encoding transcription factors with high similarity to their putative homologs in f. verticillioides were higher than genes encoding non-conserved transcription factors . furthermore, when each category of genes, grouped by the degree of similarity, was mapped on the four chromosomes of f. graminearum, a clear differential gene distribution pattern was observed. conserved genes tend to cluster together as well as less conserved genes . strikingly, no conserved genes  are located at one of the terminal regions of fgchr  <dig> figure  <dig> 
gene expression levels in relation to their degree of similarity.  the expression levels of genes with orthologs  or genes without orthologs  in f. verticillioides were quantified by their rpkm values.  genes were categorized into five groups according to their degree of similarity with those of f. verticillioides . the proportion of each category of genes on each chromosome was calculated.  box plot analysis of the expression of genes on each chromosome according to their degree of similarity with those of f. verticillioides. log2-transformed rpkm values were used to evaluate gene expression levels.  box plot analysis of the expression of  <dig> transcription factor genes  according to the degree of similarity with those of f. verticillioides. log2-transformed rpkm values were used to evaluate gene expression levels.



expression of genes in non-conserved regions is highly variable in different developmental stages
to investigate whether gene expression in non-conserved regions is invariably low, or whether it is related to a specific growth stage, rna-seq analysis was performed on conidia of f. graminearum isolate ph- <dig> produced in mung bean medium. three biologically independent replicates were analyzed and in total  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained. gene expression patterns on each chromosome of f. graminearum were analyzed with the obtained rna-seq data. firstly, similar gene expression patterns on each chromosome of f. graminearum were observed for the three biological replicates . secondly, also in conidia nearly all non-conserved regions exhibited significantly lower gene expression levels than conserved regions . however, some parts of non-conserved regions, especially in regions nc <dig> and nc <dig> showed expression levels similar to conserved regions . in addition, we compared the gene expression levels between conidia and mycelium in each 20 kb window on each chromosome. strikingly, the relative expression  of genes located in conserved regions is relatively constant, while the relative expression of genes in non-conserved regions is sometimes highly variable . furthermore, we selected the  <dig> genes that exhibit the strongest up- and down-regulation between the two different developmental stages and mapped their locations on each chromosome of f. graminearum. we found that these highly induced or repressed genes are significantly abundant in non-conserved regions  . these data suggest that gene expression in non-conserved regions might be important for f. graminearum to respond to external stimuli or during specific phases of its life cycle, while gene expression in conserved regions are more stable and are more likely to be involved in housekeeping functions.figure  <dig>

non-conserved regions are enriched for genes encoding secreted proteins and enzymes required for the production of secondary metabolites
to further understand the biological relevance of non-conserved regions, we examined which categories of genes are enriched in the non-conserved regions. firstly, we studied the distribution of all genes encoding secreted proteins in f. graminearum. previously, brown et al.
 <cit>  identified  <dig> genes encoding secreted proteins in the f. graminearum genome
 <cit> . distribution of these genes on each chromosome of f. graminearum showed that  <dig> locate in non-conserved regions and  <dig> in conserved regions , suggesting that they are significantly enriched in non-conserved regions . moreover, a higher proportion of genes encoding secreted proteins were observed on chromosome  <dig>  . secondly, the distribution of secondary metabolite genes, including  <dig> polyketide synthase  genes and  <dig> non-ribosomal peptide  genes
 <cit>  also appeared to be unevenly distributed:  <dig> pks genes and  <dig> nrps genes locate in non-conserved regions, while only one pks gene and two nrps genes were found in conserved regions. this indicates that genes involved in secondary metabolism are also enriched in non-conserved regions. . in contrast, ribosomal genes that are essential for growth are enriched in conserved regions  and fewer ribosomal genes are identified on chromosome  <dig> of f. graminearum . in contrast, transcription factor-encoding genes were randomly distributed on each chromosome of f. graminearum  .figure  <dig>

non-conserved regions are enriched for relocated genes
as mentioned above,  <dig> genes in f. graminearum have homologs in f. verticillioides. to further demonstrate that genes with their putative homologs in f. verticillioides are likely to be true orthologs, the homologs in f. verticillioides were aligned against the genes in f. graminearum using blastn and we found that  <dig> gene pairs are the reciprocal best blast hits, suggesting that they are orthologs . these genes can be further divided into two groups based on their collinearity with their orthologs. most f. graminearum genes have their putative orthologs on one of the collinear chromosomes of f. verticillioides, while some genes have their putative orthologs located on non-collinear chromosomes of f. verticillioides. the number of genes matching to putative orthologs on each chromosome of f. verticillioides is presented in table 
 <dig>  for example, on fgchr  <dig>   <dig> genes have a putative ortholog on the collinear chromosomes  of f. verticillioides, whereas for  <dig> genes, putative orthologs were shown on non-collinear chromosomes of f. verticillioides. we then mapped all these genes on the chromosomes of f. graminearum and found that non-conserved regions are highly enriched for these genes . this indicates that non-conserved regions in f. graminearum are enriched in genes that have undergone relocation. a similar pattern was observed when comparing f. graminearum with f. oxysporum . further evidence for these relocations comes from the fact that in  <dig>  of these relocations a single gene was relocated, but in  <dig>  cases two neighbouring genes and in  <dig>  cases three or more neighbouring genes were relocated together. figure 
7c shows one example of a relocation of four neighbouring genes in f. graminearum. on fvchr <dig> four genes were found between genes fveg_ <dig> and fveg_ <dig>  whereas no genes were identified between orthologs fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig> in f. graminearum, indicating that these four genes have been relocated to a new location in f. graminearum. blast analysis of the four f. verticillioides genes showed that their orthologs in f. graminearum are relocated to the non-conserved region nc <dig> of fgchr  <dig> figure  <dig>

to understand whether genes that are relocated to non-conserved regions are also affected in expression, we compared the expression levels of relocated genes with non-relocated genes. this analysis indicated that expression of relocated genes was significantly lower than non-relocated genes under the conditions examined .

secondary metabolite gene clusters are assembled in non-conserved regions by gene relocations
as shown above, most of secondary metabolite genes are located in non-conserved regions, and previous studies have shown that genes producing secondary metabolites are often clustered
 <cit> , but whether these secondary metabolite gene clusters are assembled by gene relocations is still unknown. here we found that gene clusters, such as pks <dig>  pks <dig>  pks <dig>  pks <dig> and pks <dig>  are probably formed by gene relocations, as genes in these clusters have orthologs that are located on different chromosomes of f. verticillioides. this is exemplified by the pks <dig> gene cluster of which most genes have high similarity to their orthologs . the ortholog of pks <dig> gene is located on chromosome  <dig> of f. verticillioides. other genes that are typically associated with secondary metabolite gene clusters, such as mfs monosaccharide transporter, nad binding oxidoreductase, alcohol dehydrogenase, cytochrome p <dig> family protein and c <dig> transcription factor, have their orthologs located on the chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of f. verticillioides, respectively . this result suggests that secondary metabolite gene clusters could be formed by gene relocations as was found for other genes in the non-conserved regions.figure  <dig>

the origin of lineage-specific chromosomes in f. oxysporum
f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopercisi isolate  <dig> contains eleven core chromosomes and four lineage-specific  chromosomes
 <cit> . comparison of core chromosomes of f. oxysporum with those of f. verticillioides through synteny analysis revealed several non-conserved regions , especially at the end of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  to determine whether the four ls chromosomes and non-conserved regions on core chromosomes of f. oxysporum are enriched for gene relocations, we selected all genes of f. oxysporum with homologs on a non-collinear chromosome of f. verticillioides and assigned these genes to each chromosome of f. oxysporum. the four ls chromosomes appear to be enriched for genes that have relocated from core chromosomes . gene relocations were also supported by the observation that multiple groups of adjacent genes on ls chromosomes showed collinearity with their homologs on the chromosomes of f. verticillioides . in addition, relocation of genes was also observed in non-conserved regions of core chromosomes of f. oxysporum, especially in one telomere proximal region of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, synteny block analysis of chromosomes in f. oxysporum was performed and we found that most of the genes present on ls chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> are duplicated, which is consistent with previous findings
 <cit> . some genes on ls chromosome  <dig> might originate from ls chromosomes  <dig> or  <dig>  interestingly, genes on ls chromosome  <dig> are duplicated from core chromosome  <dig> , suggesting that ls chromosome  <dig> originally arose from core chromosome.

discussion
genome comparison between closely related species may help us to understand the mechanism of genome evolution and apprehend how species evolve to adapt to new environments
. comparing the genome of homo sapiens with the closely related species chimpanzee showed that  <dig> % of the genomic sequences are similar
 <cit> , but  <dig>  putative inversions were identified on the chromosomes of h. sapiens <cit>  that are likely to be involved in genome evolution. large-scale translocations and inversions appear to have also occurred in the ascomycete saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . here, we compared the genome of f. graminearum with that of two closely related species f. verticillioides and f. oxysporum. again, a large number of translocations and inversions were identified. next to these translocations and inversions of large chromosomal segments, non-conserved regions are commonly discovered in closely related species. for instance, synteny analysis of the genome of aspergillus nidulans with related species a. fumigatus and a. oryzae showed that around 78% of the genome could be mapped to conserved syntenic blocks, while the remaining genomic sequences lack significant syntenic blocks
 <cit> . in addition, syntenic analysis of  <dig> sequenced drosophila species showed that on average 66% of each genome was covered by syntenic blocks
 <cit> , indicating that the location of the remaining 34% of the genome is not conserved. comparing the genome of f. graminearum with those of f. verticillioides and f. oxysporum, thirteen non-conserved regions were identified. the presence of these non-conserved regions suggests that genome evolution has occurred unevenly across the chromosomes. although non-conserved regions frequently occur in the genomes of many species, their origin and biological relevance are still largely unknown.

the development of rna-seq technology
 <cit>  allowed us to evaluate the global gene expression patterns along chromosomes
 <cit> . in this study, we used rna-seq data obtained from the mycelium of the sequenced isolate ph- <dig> of f. graminearum grown in nutrient-rich medium to investigate the gene expression pattern along whole chromosomes. interestingly, we found two striking features in f. graminearum:  there is a strong correlation between the degree of gene conservation and gene expression level and  genes in the non-conserved regions showed lower expression levels than genes in the conserved regions. in addition, comparing gene expression levels between conidia and mycelium, we found that the expression of genes in non-conserved regions is highly variable, while the expressions of genes in conserved regions is surprisingly stable. this indicates the expression of genes in conserved regions is less dependent on fungal development , while the expression of genes in non-conserved regions seems more developmentally regulated. furthermore, house-keeping genes are more abundant in conserved regions, while genes required in specific developmental stages or environmental conditions are found more often in non-conserved regions. this conclusion was supported by the fact that genes encoding secreted proteins or involved in the production of secondary metabolites, which are induced under specific conditions
, are more abundant in non-conserved regions, while ribosomal genes are mainly located in conserved regions.

gene enrichment in specific chromosomal regions has also been studied in other species. for instance, secondary metabolite genes are enriched in subtelomeric regions of aspergillus species. the rapid rearrangement of subtelomeric regions may promote the rapid evolution of these genes to become species-specific attributes
 <cit> . in the plant pathogenic fungus verticillium dahliae, in planta-expressed genes are enriched in lineage-specific genomic regions that have developed by extensive chromosomal reshuffling, which was suggested to drive evolution of virulence
 <cit> . in f. oxysporum, genes encoding secreted effectors and virulence factors are more abundant in ls chromosomes, while few house-keeping genes are identified on ls chromosomes
 <cit> . the drivers and biological relevance of gene enrichment in specific chromosome regions are still not fully understood. one possible reason could be that clustering of genes with similar expression patterns may facilitate co-regulation of specific sets of genes under specific conditions or developmental stages. this phenomenon has been observed in many species, such as yeast, mouse and human
. secondly, changes in gene expression levels have also been shown to be important in adaptive evolution
 <cit> , so perhaps enrichment of genes in non-conserved regions could facilitate them to rapidly change their expression pattern.

our data indicate that genes in non-conserved regions are weakly expressed, but how the expression of these genes is suppressed is still unknown. previous studies have shown that gene position in the nucleus is associated with their transcriptional regulation, for instance, the nuclear periphery was considered as a zone for transcriptionally repressed genes
 <cit> . this type of organization could also occur in f. graminearum and non-conserved regions could form specific sub-compartments of the nucleus with repressed gene expression.

the non-conserved regions occur widely, but how they are generated is still unclear. in this study, many gene relocations were identified in non-conserved regions of f. graminearum, in contrast to conserved regions. gene relocations have been described previously in s. cerevisiae where the dal gene cluster, including six genes, was formed by gene relocations from six different loci
 <cit> . in f. graminearum and f. sporotrichioides, trichothecene biosynthesis requires genes at three loci: the 12-gene tri cluster, a second locus with two genes , and a third locus with one gene . however, in the more distantly related species f. equiseti, both tri <dig> and tri <dig> are located within the tri core cluster suggesting that the latter two genes have been relocated during evolution of f. equiseti <cit> . we also showed that four successive genes were relocated to a non-conserved region in f. graminearum. however, how these genes are marked for relocation is still obscure. based on our findings that genes with low similarity to their homologs have low expression levels , we hypothesize that the relocated genes in non-conserved chromosome regions already had a low expression level before they were relocated. possibly, in the three dimensional organization of chromosomes in the interphase these weakly expressed genes are in close proximity with the likewise weakly expressed non-conserved regions. such a close proximity might facilitate targeted relocation of weakly expressed genes to one of these non-conserved regions.

in f. oxysporum, four ls chromosomes and  <dig> core chromosomes were identified. it was suggested that these four ls chromosomes were generated by horizontal transfer from a yet unknown fungal source
 <cit> . also for the dispensable chromosomes in zymoseptoria tritici horizontal gene transfer was hypothesized
 <cit> . although horizontal gene transfer is one of the reasonable explanations for the origin of ls chromosomes in f. oxysporum <cit> , other mechanisms or events could also contribute to the formation of ls regions. in this study, the frequent gene relocations identified in non-conserved regions of f. graminearum drove us to hypothesize that the generation of ls chromosomes in f. oxysporum could also have included extensive gene relocations. this hypothesis was supported by the fact that around  <dig> genes on ls chromosomes have a homolog in f. verticillioides, and in  <dig> cases, two or more adjacent genes are collinear with their homologs. in addition, large part of ls chromosome  <dig> represents a duplication of the telomere proximal region of core chromosome  <dig>  suggesting that it might originate from the core chromosome. based on the studies by us and others
 <cit> , we proposed that most likely horizontal gene transfer from other fungal species and gene relocations within the species both occurred in f. oxysporum.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data demonstrate that chromosomes of f. graminearum show distinct conserved and non-conserved regions. subsequent gene expression analysis showed that genes in these regions exhibit different expression patterns. genes showing high and stable expression levels are more abundant in conserved regions, while genes that are induced or repressed in specific developmental stages or under different environmental conditions  are significantly abundant in non-conserved regions. this type of genome arrangement may not only facilitate the co-regulation of specific sets of genes, but could also enable fungi to maintain on the one hand the required conservation of house-keeping genes and on the other to accelerate the evolution of species-specific genes to rapidly adapt to new environments or new hosts. moreover, due to the selective transcription of genes in non-conserved regions, this could prevent organisms spending too much energy in transcription and translation of evolving genes that do not have acquired full functionality yet.
