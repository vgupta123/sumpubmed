BACKGROUND
eukaryotic dna is packaged within the nucleus through its association with histone proteins forming the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, the nucleosome. the nucleosome consists of  <dig> bp of dna wrapped around a histone core octamer composed of two each of histones h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig>  <cit> . histone c- and n-terminal tails are flexible, protrude from the nucleosome octamer structure, and are subjected to post-translational modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination or sumoylation. among these modifications, histone lysine methylation patterns have been associated with distinct chromatin states and are proposed to be major epigenetic marks that could extend the information potential of the genetic code by fixing the chromatin organization in a heritable manner .

in particular, constitutive heterochromatin, considered as the part of the genome that is gene poor, transcriptionally silent and highly condensed in interphase cells, is characterized to harbour nucleosomes rich in trimethylation at lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig> , trimethylation at lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  and monomethylation at lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>   <cit> . the histone methyltransferases suv39h <dig> and suv39h <dig> play a crucial role in the initial steps of heterochromatin formation in mammals by selective trimethylation of h3k <dig>  <cit> . indeed, mice that are deficient for suv39h activities were shown to display impaired h3k <dig> trimethylation at pericentric heterochromatin and were subjected to chromosomal instability  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms by which suv39h <dig> and suv39h <dig> are recruited at heterochromatin are still unknown but were suggested to be mediated by direct or indirect association with components of a rna interference pathway  <cit> . according to current models, h3k9me <dig> marks placed by suv39h activities stabilize heterochromatin protein  <dig>  binding at heterochromatin  <cit> , and hp <dig> proteins would then recruit the histone methyltransferases suv420h <dig> and suv420h <dig> which in turn, trimethylate h4k <dig>  <cit> . at present, it is unclear whether suv420h histone methyltransferases interact only temporally with chromatin to methylate h4k <dig> or participate in a more stable multiprotein complex together with hp <dig> or other chromatin proteins to support a stable heterochromatin structure.

interestingly, maintenance of stable heterochromatin domains in living cells involves the transient binding and dynamic exchange of hp <dig> from chromatin  <cit>  indicating that heterochromatin is not a static and inaccessible higher order conformation but is a dynamic domain of chromatin. in contrast to hp <dig>  suv39h <dig> has a significantly slower exchange rate and a substantial fraction immobile at heterochromatin  <cit> , and nothing is known about the dynamics of the suv420h class of histone methyltransferases.

to gain further insights into the role that suv420h <dig> plays in heterochromatin, we first used a directed proteomic analysis of suv420h2-binding proteins in cells using the tandem affinity purification -mass spectrometry  methodology  <cit> . we showed that hp <dig> proteins are the main suv420h <dig> interacting partners. we then investigated the in vivo kinetics of suv420h <dig> in mouse l <dig> cells and compared them to those of hp <dig> proteins. using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  analysis we showed that in contrast to hp <dig> proteins, suv420h <dig> has a slow exchange rate and is largely strongly bound at pericentric heterochromatin. furthermore, we mapped the domain responsible for stable association to chromatin to a region of  <dig> amino-acids of suv420h <dig>  previously defined as the heterochromatic targeting module by schotta et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
suv420h <dig> interacts with hp <dig> proteins
pericentric regions, as well as telomeres, are part of the constitutive heterochromatin, which is characterized by hypermethylation of dna, hypoacetylation and hypermethylation of histones. in particular, trimethylation of h3k <dig>  and trimethylation of h4k <dig>  by the suv39h and suv420h histone methyltransferases respectively, mark pericentric chromatin  <cit> . in order to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in the recruitment of suv420h enzymes at heterochromatin and identify their interacting partners, we applied the tandem affinity purification  technology coupled to tandem mass spectrometry , since this approach has proven to efficiently allow the characterization of protein complexes from different cells in culture or organisms  <cit> . tap/ms analysis of protein associations around suv420h <dig> was performed from hela cells, because we have assembled a database of more than  <dig> tap/ms experiments from proteins involved in chromatin regulation in this cell line. this dataset allows reliable assessment of a given interaction .

a retrovirus gene transfer strategy was used to generate a cell pool expressing tap-tagged suv420h <dig> fusion protein. expanded cell pools were subjected to tandem affinity purification, a procedure consisting of two specific binding and two specific elution steps under mild conditions, which preserve the integrity of non-transient protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the affinity purified complexes were resolved on sds-page and coomassie stained . then, proteins were identified by peptide sequence determination using tandem mass spectrometry . most proteins were characterized by the identification of several peptides . details on protein identification procedures are given in the methods section. the tagged suv420h <dig> protein represents a prominent band on the gel and was identified by peptides covering 36% of its total sequence . however, suv420h <dig> was not the most abundant protein recovered by tap/ms since tubulin, which is considered as a tap/ms contaminant, remains the most prominent identified protein. this relative low recovery of suv420h <dig> by tap is probably due to its strong association to chromatin . sonication or addition of intercalating agents such as ethidium bromide  <cit> , prior to protein extraction, did not improve the recovery rate of suv420h <dig> by tap/ms . in spite of a weak recovery of the bait, heterochromatin proteins   <dig> were identified as specific suv420h <dig> interactors  by identified peptides covering 53%  and 15%  of their total sequence, respectively. the third member of the hp <dig> protein family, hp1β  was not formally identified in the purification. however, the peptide iigatdssgelmflmk identified in the suv420h <dig> purification, is common to hp1γ and hp1β sequences. moreover, hp1β was identified by western blotting using specific anti-hp1β antibodies in the tap-suv420h <dig> purified samples . consequently, an interaction between suv420h <dig> and hp1β might occur as well. none of the other proteins identified by tap/ms appeared to be specific to the suv420h <dig> purification when compared to our dataset. thus, we conclude that suv420h <dig> mainly interacts with the hp <dig> isotypes in vivo; hp1α, hp1γ and hp1β as well.

shotta et al  <cit>  mapped a hp1-binding domain of murine suv420h <dig> in the aa349– <dig> protein region referred as the heterochromatic targeting module, once this domain is also responsible for suv420h <dig> targeting at heterochromatin. to confirm that such a functional module is also conserved in the human ortholog, the corresponding region  from human suv420h <dig> was expressed in e. coli as a recombinant gst fusion protein and bound to glutathione-sepharose beads. full-length tap-tagged hp1α, hp1β and hp1γ were expressed in hek <dig> cells and incubated with gst-suv420h <dig>  fragments. after extensive washings, bound proteins were eluted with glutathione, separated on sds-page and western blots were probed with peroxydase coupled anti-peroxydase antibody for detection of tap-tagged hp <dig> isotypes. figure 2a shows that the suv420h <dig>  fragment interacts with all three hp <dig> proteins. in contrast, recombinant gst-gfp fusion protein does not interact with hp <dig>  excluding unspecific binding to the gst-tag. thus, the heterochromatic targeting module from human suv420h <dig>  as previously described for its mouse counterpart  <cit> , interacts with all three hp <dig> isotypes, hp1α, hp1β and hp1γ . interestingly, this domain of suv420h <dig> contains a pyvrv sequence, which is similar to the pentameric sequences found through a phage display analysis with the drosophila melanogaster hp <dig> chromoshadow domain  <cit>  and present in a number of proteins interacting to mammalian hp <dig> chromoshadow domains  <cit> .

to define the hp <dig> regions involved in the binding to suv420h <dig>  tap-tagged mutants of hp1γ were transiently expressed in hek <dig> cells. nuclear protein extracts were incubated with the recombinant gst-suv420h <dig>  heterochromatic targeting module . deletion of hp1γ chromoshadow domain  abolishes hp1γ dimerization as expected  <cit> , but also the interaction with the suv420h <dig>  fragment, whereas deletion of lysine  <dig> to lysine  <dig> within the hp1γ hinge region does not affect binding to the suv420h <dig> heterochromatic targeting module. thus, the hp <dig> csd is required for suv420h2-hp <dig> interaction. in order to test whether the hp <dig> csd is sufficient for such an interaction, a gst-csd fusion protein was expressed in e. coli, bound to glutathione-sepharose and incubated with in vitro translated tap-suv420h <dig>  or tap-gfp proteins. figure 2c shows that the suv420h <dig>  fragment specifically interacts with gst-csd, but not gst-gfp. taken all together, these results indicate that the interaction between suv420h <dig> and hp <dig> proteins is mediated by the binding of the heterochromatic targeting module to the chromoshadow domain of the respective proteins.

hp <dig> is a dynamic component of heterochromatin and its dynamics depend on the cell cycle
to assay for protein dynamics at heterochromatin, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching   <cit>  experiments were performed in live murine l <dig> cells. these cells were used in our imaging analyses, because mouse fibroblastic cells present a defined distribution of heterochromatic domains revealed by hoechst staining patterns as bright fluorescent nuclear regions .

gfp-hp <dig> expressing cells were generated using retroviral gene transduction. fusion proteins of gfp with hp1α, hp1β and hp1γ were shown to localize to these heterochromatin foci . the endogenous hp <dig> counterparts were shown to be localized at the same nuclear domains, as revealed by immunochemistry using specific anti-hp <dig> antibodies . expression of gfp-hp <dig> fusion proteins was analyzed by western blotting using specific antibodies for each hp <dig> isotype . gfp-hp <dig> fusion proteins were expressed as full-length proteins at levels significantly higher  or similar  to those of their endogenous counterparts.

defined areas of ~ <dig>  μm of diameter were irreversibly photobleached by five excitation pulses of  <dig> ms. fluorescence recovery in the same areas was imaged at regular time intervals . the relative fluorescence intensity values for each experiment were collected and plotted in a frap curve after correction for photobleaching. the t1/ <dig> value of fluorescence recovery, which is a measure for the speed of replacement of molecules in the bleached area by molecules from the environment was determined, as well as the intensity of fluorescence recovery after  <dig> s, which is a measure of the mobile fraction of molecules . as previously reported by others in other cell types  <cit> , figure 3c–d shows that hp <dig> proteins are highly dynamic components of heterochromatin in l <dig> cells. the high mobility of ectopically expressed gfp-hp <dig> proteins might not be a consequence of protein overexpression since similar observations have been obtained in different experimental settings  <cit> . for instances, schmiedeberg et al  <cit>  determined similar t1/ <dig> values from hep- <dig> cells expressing gfp-hp <dig> proteins at levels lower than those of their endogenous counterparts. it indicates that hp <dig> dynamic parameters do not depend on the gfp-hp <dig> expression levels. however, we observed that for each of the three gfp-hp <dig> isotypes, t1/ <dig> values from one photobleached cell to another show a significantly high variability .

in order to test whether this large distribution of t1/ <dig> values could reflect different states of the cells, we performed frap experiments after cell synchronization . gfp-hp <dig> expressing cells were blocked in g <dig> by serum starvation for  <dig> hours, or in g2/m transition using a nocodazole treatment for  <dig> hours  <cit> . cell synchronization was verified by fluorescent-activated cell sorter  analysis in presence of propidium iodide  <cit> , and frap performed. figure 4a–b shows that, in all cases, cell synchronization reduces the variability of the t1/ <dig> values. after serum deprivation, the t1/ <dig> was ~ <dig>  s, ~ <dig>  s, and  <dig>  s for hp1α, hp1β and hp1γ, respectively, but only ~ <dig>  s, ~ <dig>  s, and ~ <dig>  s after the nocodazole treatment. both serum starvation and nocodazole treatment did not affect gfp-hp <dig> protein localization  or protein expression . this suggests that hp <dig> proteins at heterochromatin have faster dynamics in g <dig> rather than in g <dig> phase of the cell cycle.

in order to demonstrate that these differences in hp <dig> dynamics were due to intrinsic properties of hp <dig> but not a consequence of the treatments, similar experiments were performed with nsd3s, another protein associated to heterochromatin. based on alternative splicing events, the nsd <dig> gene encodes two different proteins  <cit> : a long isoform  related to the histone methyltransferase nsd <dig>  and a short isoform  which does not contain the set domain and the phd fingers, but still harbouring a pwwp motif. nsd3s was stably expressed as a gfp fusion protein in l <dig> cells using retroviral transduction. figure 5a shows that nsd3s is targeted at pericentric heterochromatin. frap experiments revealed that nsd3s is as dynamic as hp <dig> at heterochromatin . gfp-nsd3s fluorescence recovery reached ~80% after  <dig> s with a t1/ <dig> value ~ <dig>  s. these dynamic parameters are similar to those of hp <dig> proteins , indicating that hp <dig> proteins are not the only mobile components associated to heterochromatin with such a highly dynamic exchange rate. next, frap experiments after cell synchronization were performed on gfp-nsd3s expressing l <dig> cells. figure 5d–e shows that t1/ <dig> values are relatively similar after serum starvation and nocodazole treatment. this result indicates that the treatments used to induce cell synchronization do not modify significantly nsd3s dynamics at heterochromatin. consequently, the differences of mobility in hp <dig> protein dynamics during the cell cycle are indeed due to their intrinsic properties, but not to culture conditions.

suv420h <dig> is a stable component of heterochromatin
to gain insights into the dynamic properties of suv420h <dig> and its association to heterochromatin, frap experiments were performed on l <dig> stably expressing a gfp-suv420h <dig> fusion protein . in contrast to hp <dig> proteins, gfp-suv420h <dig> fluorescence recovery reached only 10% as a maximum after  <dig> s, suggesting that ~90% of the suv420h <dig> fraction is stably bound within heterochromatic domains. even after several minutes, the intensity of fluorescence recovery remains weak . together, these results indicate that suv420h <dig> is more stably associated to heterochromatin than hp <dig> proteins. this suggests that in addition to its function as a histone methyltransferase, suv420h <dig> might have a structural role in chromatin organization.

to identify the protein domains involved in stable association of suv420h <dig> at heterochromatin, we stably expressed various protein deletions as gfp fusions in l <dig> cells. figure 6a shows a schematic representation of the protein truncations used. consistent with previous data  <cit> , the n-terminus of suv420h <dig> comprising the catalytically active set domain is dispersed within the nucleus, whereas the c-terminal part of the protein is associated with heterochromatin that corresponds to hoechst dense staining . moreover, the  <dig> amino-acids region comprising the heterochromatic targeting module of suv420h <dig> is sufficient to recapitulate full length protein localization. next, frap studies were performed in l <dig> cells expressing suv420h <dig> c-termini-gfp fusion proteins still located at heterochromatin foci. the c-terminal truncation as well as the heterochromatic targeting module alone, show kinetic properties similar to those of suv420h <dig> full length . at the opposite, the suv420h <dig>  protein region comprising the set domain, is highly mobile. thus, in contrast to suv39h <dig> for which the set domain has been shown to contribute to heterochromatin binding  <cit> , all the dynamic characteristics of suv420h <dig> are restricted to the  <dig> amino-acids heterochromatic targeting module.

so far, the mechanism by which the heterochromatic targeting module is tightly bound to chromatin remains elusive. using a gst-pull down-mass spectrometry strategy, the only proteins found to interact in vitro with this domain were the hp <dig> proteins , but other approaches are ongoing to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in the linkage of suv420h <dig> to heterochromatin.

next, we compared the suv420h <dig> kinetics with the one of h2afy. h2afy  is a variant of histone h2a, enriched at the inactive x chromosome in female mammals and found at other chromosomal locations  <cit> . since h2afy is more resistant to salt extraction than canonical h2a  <cit> , it is expected that h2afy might be in more stable association with h3-h <dig> and/or dna than h2a. h2afy was stably expressed as a gfp fusion protein in l <dig> cells using retroviral transduction. figure 7a shows that h2afy is targeted at foci identified by hoechst staining as pericentric heterochromatin regions, like suv420h <dig>  frap experiments performed over more than  <dig> min showed that fluorescence recovery after  <dig> min is ~22% and ~7% for gfp-suv420h <dig> and gfp-h2afy, respectively . thus, suv420h <dig> is stably bound to heterochromatin, but not as strongly as the nucleosome component, h2afy.

CONCLUSIONS
the suv420h family of histone methyltransferases catalyzes trimethylation of histone h4k <dig> which is characteristic to pericentric heterochromatin. so far, little is known about the mechanisms by which this protein class is recruited to and interacts with chromatin.

here, we applied the tap/ms approach in order to identify proteins associated to the histone methyltransfase suv420h <dig>  in our purification, a relatively weak amount of suv420h <dig> was recovered, presumably because the protein is tightly bound to chromatin. we assume that the suv420h <dig> captured by tap mainly correspond to the nucleoplasm soluble fraction. most of the proteins identified by tap/ms appeared to be nonspecific and recovered in a number of unrelated purifications . however, members of the hp <dig> family were found as specific suv420h2-binding partners. since only part of the suv420h <dig> population was purified, we cannot exclude that a number of suv420h <dig> interacting partners, and in particular the proteins associated to the suv420h <dig> fraction the most tightly bound to chromatin, were not identified.

we used in vitro gst-pull down assays, to map the domains of interaction between suv420h <dig> and hp <dig> proteins. as previously described for the mouse suv420h <dig> ortholog  <cit> , an  <dig> amino-acids region defined as the heterochromatic targeting module of suv420h <dig> interacts with hp1α, hp1β and hp1γ proteins. using deletion mutants, the hp <dig> chromoshadow domain was shown to be sufficient for binding to the suv420h <dig> heterochromatic targeting module.

to investigate the mechanisms by which suv420h <dig> could be recruited at heterochromatin and the possible role of hp <dig> proteins in this recruitment, protein dynamics were studied using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  in living cells  <cit> . for a long time, heterochromatin was considered as a stable structure maintained in an inaccessible conformation that would exclude transcriptional activation. this concept has changed when hp <dig> was shown by frap analysis to be highly mobile  <cit> . in our study, we show that nsd3s is another protein transiently bound to pericentric heterochromatin, reinforcing the idea that the dynamic nature of heterochromatin is essential to its function. along our study, we also showed that hp <dig> exchange kinetics is modified during the cell cycle, indicating that heterochromatin organization is modulated during the cell cycle progression. however, not all the proteins bound to pericentric heterochromatin are in continuous flux with the nucleoplasm since krouels et al. showed that a substantial fraction of the histone methyltransferase suv39h <dig> is stably associated with chromatin  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that the major part of suv420h <dig> is also tightly bound at pericentric heterochromatin, indicating that in addition to its histone methyltransferase activity, suv420h <dig> might have a structural role in chromatin organization. we showed that the heterochromatic targeting module is sufficient to fully recapitulate suv420h <dig> dynamic properties. then, in contrast to suv39h <dig>  <cit> , the set domain of suv420h <dig> is not required for stable binding of the protein to pericentric heterochromatin.

genetic studies indicated that h3k <dig> trimethylation would precede h4k <dig> trimethylation, and that hp <dig> which recognizes h3k <dig> trimethylation could target suv420h class of histone methyltransferases to heterochromatin  <cit> . our data confirm such an interaction in vitro and in vivo. however, frap experiments reveal that in contrast to hp <dig>  suv420h <dig> is strongly associated to pericentric heterochromatin. thus, the fraction of suv420h <dig> captured and characterized by tap/ms is the soluble fraction which may be in a stable association with hp <dig>  consequently, we speculate that suv420h <dig> is recruited to heterochromatin in association with hp <dig>  but stably maintained at its sites in an hp1-independent fashion.
