BACKGROUND
fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe and budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae are among the original model organisms in the study of the cell-division cycle  <cit> . in particular, our understanding of the cell cycle of s. cerevisiae was greatly enhanced over the last decade owing to several genome-wide expression studies  <cit> . based on such high-throughput studies, detailed regulatory networks for budding yeast were reconstructed on genome-wide scale and complexity, e.g.,  <cit> . yet, unlike s. cerevisiae, no comprehensive cell cycle regulatory network is known for s. pombe. it has only been partially characterized  <cit> . as a result, important regulatory cascades in budding yeast have no known or complete counterpart in fission yeast.

past comparisons of networks, which revealed both conserved and divergent control elements for similar modules across different yeasts species  <cit> , highlighted the importance for constructing a large-scale regulatory network for fission yeast. recently, three independent microarray studies have generated genome-wide time course gene expression data for the cell cycle of s. pombe  <cit>  making it currently the organism with the largest cell cycle transcriptome. a subsequent meta-analysis  <cit>  of ten experiments from the three studies was a first step towards aligning the data sets but no major attempt to reconstruct a s. pombe regulatory network has been made. using one of the gene expression time course studies of the s. pombe cell cycle, nachman and regev  <cit>  used a biochemical regulatory network inference  method to identify transcriptional- and motif-based modules comprising some of the known and novel regulatory networks that control the fission yeast cell cycle. however, the limited gene expression data set representing a single form of cell cycle synchronization , the noise inherent in the small data set and phase-specific differences between genes and transcription factors  all pose real challenges to the discovery of a comprehensive and reliable regulatory network.

in this study, we reconstructed a global gene regulatory network along with a comprehensive parts-list of co-regulated genes and significant regulators to allow system-level modularization of the interconnected processes involved in the s. pombe cell cycle. we adopted two algorithmic strategies for constructing the parts-list: 1) using the estimates of time period and phase angles from a non-linear model, we computed phase-specific time-lagged correlations between tf-gene pairs to infer the activities of a large set of regulators and 2) partitioning a large pool of genes into clusters that are not only co-expressed in many of the ten time course experiments but are also co-regulated in the ten tf deletion and over expression experiments. these two workflows converged to produce a phase-specific network of regulatory modules. finally we dissected the network to identify cis-elements that may indicate putative mechanisms for phase-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the fission yeast cell cycle.

for the researcher, the modularization of the s. pombe cell cycle by our gene and module networks allows for investigation of various phase-specific hypotheses on fission yeast cell cycle regulation. due to the lack of strong evidence of transcriptional regulation in the g <dig> phase of the s. pombe cell cycle, as compared with s. cerevisiae, it was speculated that post-transcriptional regulation might be more active in fission yeast  <cit> . indeed among the enhanced clusters of ribosome biogenesis genes that express during the g <dig> phase in s. pombe, we identified new, highly significant and distinctive rna motifs in their 3' utr sequences, thus lending support to that hypothesis. we provided evidence for transcript decay of these genes with the help of statistical analysis of their time course profiles and data from previous experiments. thereby, we also demonstrated how our parts-list could be systematically mined for generating interesting experimentally testable hypotheses.

RESULTS
new modules and regulators at m and g <dig> phases
using a curated collection of  <dig> tfs in s. pombe with known or predicted protein domains  <cit> , we computed phase-specific time-lagged correlation of expression profiles of all tf-gene pairs. the statistically significant  and consistent  correlations helped us identify a tf that is active within a phase-specific regulatory context as well as its targets therein. specifically, a tf's activity  is its weighted average effect as a regulator on the downstream targets at a given time point. using network component analysis   <cit>  we inferred strongly periodic tfas for  <dig> tfs  with respect to  <dig> target genes  during different phases of the cell cycle . indeed the activity profile  for almost every tf  time courses) had a single, dominant periodic component as determined by the average periodogram method and the p-value from the related g-statistic  <cit>  . the average periodogram for each of the time courses plotted in figure  <dig> is used to detect the presence of a dominant frequency of cell cycle oscillation. almost every tf shows a single principal oscillation frequency in mutual agreement with the one cycle period. this is indicative of their regulation by common regulatory processes in a strongly periodic manner. while we identified most of the tfs that are go annotated for cell cycle regulation, many new candidates were also inferred .

based on the regulatory matrix of the  <dig> tfs and their downstream targets in multiple experiments, we reconstructed a gene regulatory network , which could be mined for inferring phase-specific modules and sub-networks. for instance, a majority of the  <dig> tfs were found to regulate one or more modules in the m and g <dig> phases . in addition, specific gene-level regulatory links may be studied by dissecting the global network. for instance, a subnetwork of early m phase clusters  revealed a new regulatory hub in the form of the hmg box tf spbc19g <dig>  , besides such well-known hubs as the key tf ace <dig> and the polo kinase plo <dig> 

clusters of co-regulated genes lead to new phase-specific control elements
as a basis of our large-scale regulatory network, we sought out to construct a parts-list  of statistically significant cell cycle components such as a large number of co-regulated gene clusters and their putative regulators. to increase statistical power for detection of new or subtle modes of regulation, we enhanced a bayesian algorithm  <cit>  with new strategies to co-cluster different types of experiments and identify co-regulated genes. the revised algorithm accommodates heterogeneous data types by modeling  each of the ten cell cycle time course experiments and the ten tf deletion or overexpression experiments with suitable basis functions. with the help of effective priors to model the periodically expressed profiles apart from the monotonic trends, the algorithm produced an optimal clustering of  <dig> fission yeast genes into  <dig> disjoint clusters . details regarding the  <dig> clusters of co-expressed genes are summarized in table  <dig>  a complete list of the  <dig> genes categorized by the cluster numbers is in additional file  <dig>  we also determined the regulatory signature of every cluster . an example of a periodic cluster containing  <dig> genes expressed in m phase is shown in figure  <dig> 

motifs similar to known motifs are given by the name published in the literature . newly discovered motifs are given by their consensus sequence.

the co-regulated genes within the clusters were characterized and validated. gene ontology  analysis revealed that many of the genes within the clusters were represented by known functional categories from different stages of the cell cycle . testing of circular uniformity of peak phase angles of genes in each cluster determined that  <dig> out of  <dig> clusters were cell cycle phase-specific. circular-circular regression   <cit>  showed that during cell cycle progression, the phase ordering of the  <dig> clusters exhibited significant  coherence across the ten time course experiments. significant  and non-redundant putative binding sites, many of which were conserved across different fission yeasts, were detected for most of the clusters . several new and interesting motifs were observed  beside some that were previously known .

post-transcriptional regulation of ribosome biogenesis genes
post-transcriptional regulation plays a key role in the control of gene expression in terms of processing, transport, localization, quality control and turnover of mrna transcripts. therefore, systematic identification of targets for such regulation is of fundamental importance to the investigation of multi-layered gene regulation  <cit> . in the present study, we identified new, highly conserved motifs in the 3' utr sequences of  <dig> co-regulated genes from clusters  <dig> and  <dig> that are involved mostly in ribosome biogenesis in s. pombe . two single-stranded motifs u uu g and ggg  in 3' utr  <cit>  were highly statistically significant  with strong positional bias within the range of the first  <dig> nucleotides. in the most significant occurrence of the resulting rna motif , they appeared overlapped as uucuucggguuuuaa with a small loop structure, denoted by . see additional file  <dig> for associated likelihood scores. dominant go categories of biological process and cellular component for the proteins encoded by the genes containing the motifs include rna processing  and nucleus-nucleolus  respectively .

the transcriptome and the proteome have long been compared to gain insights on rna turnover  <cit> . thus, to explore the present hypothesis, we analyzed comparative transcriptomic and proteomic measurement data of s. pombe gene expression from a previous high-throughput study  <cit> . genes with low correlation between their transcriptomic and proteomic levels could be substantially regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms  <cit> . both types of measurements were available in the above data for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that had the motifs, and for  <dig> of the remaining genes  that did not. we first computed the percentile scores separately for each measurement to be able to compare them on the same scale . as shown in the lower left  quadrant, the few genes with the motifs and low transcript levels are correlated with their protein product expression. given this data set, perhaps it may be reasonable to assume that the mrna abundance in the cells is sufficient for carrying out various biological processes during the cell cycle. however, the correlation between the transcriptomic and proteomic levels for the genes with high expression and containing the motifs was lower  than those without them . indeed most of the genes carrying the motifs and having above-average transcript level  have a steadily low protein level  potentially indicative of transcript decay or short half-life. conversely, the majority of genes without the motifs had a protein level consistent with their transcript level . similarly, high correlation  was observed for cell cycle genes in general highlighting further the discrepancy between the transcriptomic and proteomic levels of many of the genes that contained the motifs  <cit> . given the generally high values of aug context adaptation index  and ribosome occupancy  of these genes  <cit> , the discrepancy may be more likely due to post-transcriptional regulation than to lack of translational efficiency.

we believe that the shapes of the time-course profiles of genes containing the rna motifs can provide useful information regarding the pattern of their decay in g2-phase. we used standard statistical measures such as skewness and kurtosis of a time course  <cit>  to describe the decay characteristics. the skew and excess kurtosis statistics measure respectively, the asymmetry and the peakedness of a profile that could shed light on the temporal pattern of its decay. for instance, while a left skewed profile  may represent an early peaking gene, a heavy right-tailed profile  denotes slow decay rate. therefore, we first computed the skew of each of the above  <dig> profiles restricted to the first full duration of the g <dig> phase, and then the kurtosis by focusing on the right tail . we noted that most of the genes are expressed in early- to mid-g <dig> phase, i.e. with left or negative skew, as is consistent with the ribosome biogenesis expression previously observed  <cit> . clearly, most profiles had a sharp decline as g <dig> progresses, which are captured by the negative excess kurtosis of their right tails.

discussion
in the study of the systems biology of a unicellular organism such as fission yeast, the importance of the interconnected cell cycle processes cannot be over-emphasized. however, the processes could be studied both in terms of their connectedness to each other as well as their cell cycle phase-specificity. to encompass both the global and the local aspects of the underlying gene regulatory network for s. pombe, we took a 3-step approach. first, using genome-wide expression data from multiple experiments, we reconstructed a gene regulatory network based on  <dig> downstream target genes of  <dig> transcription factors that were identified to have strongly periodic activity during the cell cycle . second, we coupled tf mutant data from ten microarray studies with time course expression data from ten cell cycle experiments with the help of an enhanced bayesian co-clustering algorithm. the co-regulated and phase-specific gene modules  led to the identification of many new conserved cis-regulatory elements . third, we dissected some parts of the above network to identify cell cycle phase-specific control elements to show how the gene regulatory network and the parts-list could be used for generating hypothesis about s. pombe cell cycle regulation.

using new computational strategies and a large gene pool, we constructed a comprehensive parts-list of key regulatory genes, many interesting tfs and binding motifs, and phase-specific modules that offer insights on different aspects of the fission yeast cell cycle regulatory program . beyond a core of  <dig> strongly cell cycle regulated genes in s. pombe  <cit> , based on observed transcript oscillation, it has been noted that the number of genes that might be regulated by the cell cycle, due to reasons that are adaptive or otherwise, could be as many as  <dig>  approximately two-thirds of which may be weakly regulated  <cit> . indeed if we observe the ranking of all genes by the variance of their peak phases across ten independent experiments as determined by marguerat et al.  <cit> , then the top  <dig> genes show surprisingly low variance. thus, to identify a comprehensive set of co-regulated genes that are potentially cell cycle-related, we clustered expression data for a pool of  <dig> genes in s. pombe having highly consistent cell cycle phase characteristics . as described in the results section, the depth of the pool enabled us to detect new, unexplored modes of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in s. pombe.

in contrast with previous studies  <cit> , the larger pool size in the present study posed a computational challenge to conventional clustering, which was compounded by the relatively large number of time course and non-time course regulatory experiments. without the regulatory signatures, solely time course clustering of such a large number of genes produced noisy clusters . however, common clustering algorithms that do not distinguish between heterogeneous types of data are more likely to identify primarily the genes with the most consistent periodic profiles across experiments, while identifying the remaining majority of genes as "noisy" and clustering them arbitrarily. to address this, we enhanced the power of detection of an earlier bayesian co-clustering algorithm  <cit>  with the capacity to produce clusters of genes that are co-expressed in many, but not necessarily all of the experiments. using a mixture of regressions based on the cluster-experiment error variances , the strategy of formalizing the notion of a clustering consensus among independent experiments made our algorithm robust against inter-study variation. as a result, unlike earlier studies that did not use high-throughput data and focused on small-scale networks of biochemical interactions in the s. pombe cell cycle . recently, nachman and regev  <cit> , using a biochemical regulatory network inference  approach, have shown that cell-division specific genes ace <dig> and fkh <dig> act together in a combinatorial regulation way and that fkh <dig> and sep <dig> are involved in a negative feedback loop that may control regulatory activity at the g2/m phase of the fission yeast cell cycle. interestingly, fkh <dig> also shows high coordination with spbc19g <dig>  , a hmg box tf that is periodically expressed  at the onset of m phase  <cit> . assuming that tfs with similar tfa profiles might function together  <cit> , it is interesting to check for possible regulatory associations among these factors targeting the m phase-specific clusters. for instance, a large number of the promoters for genes in cluster  <dig> , contained two strong motifs  with best matches for binding sites of the forkhead domain  and hmg box  respectively. many of these promoters actually contain both types of binding sites, and in opposing-strand orientation, potentially indicative of combinatorial regulation . while hmg-box tfs are known to associate with forkhead tfs for ribosome biogenesis in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , their dual role with respect to chromatin, which is partly structural and partly regulatory, might be particularly favorable for the intensely active regulation at the onset of mitosis. for instance, besides acting as a conventional tf, some hmg-box tfs can also induce changes in the dna structure that enhance binding of other tfs  <cit> . on the other hand, a forkhead tf that binds to condensed chromatin during mitosis could use chromatin-remodeling for regulation  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, fkh <dig> not only regulates the g2/m specific clb <dig>  cluster  <cit> , it also represses clb <dig> with the help of a chromatin-remodeling atpase that re-positions nucleosomes in the clb <dig> promoter  <cit> .

intriguingly, no systematic study of hmg-box tfs in fission yeast is known although it is the only tf family that has  more regulatory members present in s. pombe than in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . as a regulatory hub in our predicted early m phase network, spbc19g <dig>  is linked with well-known periodically expressed mitosis and cell division proteins such as klp <dig> and klp <dig> , some of which also contained both forkhead and hmg- <dig> motifs in their upstream regulatory sequences  and are potential candidates of associated regulation.

while pointing out the gap in s. pombe regulatory cascade as compared to s. cerevisiae, it was suggested that post-transcriptional regulation might play a major role in the much longer g <dig> phase of s. pombe  <cit> . with the help of our large gene pool, we focused on two early-to-mid g <dig> clusters  containing weakly expressed ribosome biogenesis genes. ribosome biogenesis possibly involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps of gene expression regulation  <cit> , with diverse control elements in budding and fission yeasts  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, genes encoding factors involved in ribosomal rna  synthesis and ribosome assembly were among those having the least stable transcripts  <cit> . given that orthologous genes could have similar turnover across species  <cit> , it is possible that mrna stability plays an important, if not critical, role in the multi-layered regulation of ribosome biogenesis genes in s. pombe  <cit> .

transcript stability is often regulated by specific interactions between cis-elements in the 3' untranslated region  of mrnas and hundreds of different rna binding proteins  in the cell  <cit> . using some of the recently developed resources which specifically search for rna motifs that may be recognized by different rbps  <cit> , we identified highly conserved sequence and structure based rna motifs in the 3' utr sequences of  <dig> ribosome biogenesis genes. interestingly, these rna motifs were not significant in the s. cerevisiae orthologs of the  <dig> genes . neither were the motifs significant in other gene clusters in s. pombe such as the m phase cluster  <dig>  it is therefore possible that the motifs we identified are bound by proteins that perform highly distinctive  post-transcriptional regulation.

statistical analysis of the time course profiles of the  <dig> ribosome biogenesis genes containing the motifs indicated low rna turnover. despite the general pattern of their expression -- peaking early in g <dig> followed by fast decay by mid g <dig>  there were exceptions  -- and hence the reported motifs may not have a uniformly destabilizing effect. therefore, we suspect that with more detailed experiments, further regulatory classification is possible. for instance, several genes containing the rna motifs  encode small nucleolar u <dig> rnp  associated proteins that form parts of a complex involved in rrna processing and ribosome biogenesis  <cit> . indeed post-transcriptional regulation of such a specific functional class has been observed recently  <cit> . thus, it is possible that motifs such as those reported above could act as control elements not only for regulating the level, but also the quality of rna as needed for ribosome biogenesis and other processes in s. pombe.

finally, we understand that like any computational derivation, our gene and module networks are based on modeling assumptions which may not fully capture the complexity of the multi-layered regulatory program of the s. pombe cell cycle. while they are based on different types of data from many experiments, the networks could still be enhanced by future studies from various "omic" approaches. for instance, detailed chip-on-chip studies, which have greatly enhanced our understanding of the local protein-dna interactions in s. cerevisiae, could provide similar support to our networks.

CONCLUSIONS
our fission yeast regulatory network can form the starting point for a variety of inquires. together with different supporting genome-wide data for the organism such as its sequence  <cit> , proteome  <cit> , localization  <cit> , expression intermediates  <cit> , interactome  <cit> , orthology  <cit> , etc., it offers the scope for a wide range of analysis. in particular, as shown above, the underlying parts-list can be mined for insights on different phase-specific regulatory mechanisms involved in the cell cycle. it also provides a basis for generation of plausible hypotheses for experimental investigation. in this direction, we provided new testable evidence for the hypothesis  <cit>  of post-transcriptional regulation of the g <dig> phase in s. pombe in the form of new rna motifs for the ribosome biogenesis genes. as future work, we are interested to pursue some of the above results experimentally.
