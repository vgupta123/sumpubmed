BACKGROUND
iron is an essential micronutrient for plants but excess iron can be toxic. hence, plant iron homeostasis is tightly regulated. strategy i plants take up reduced iron. first, the rhizosphere is acidified by proton extrusion to solubilize fe3+, then fe3+ is reduced to fe2+ which is finally taken up into the root epidermis cell by a specific transporter . in arabidopsis thaliana, belonging to the group of strategy i plants, the p-type h+-atpase aha <dig> extrudes protons into the rhizosphere  <cit> . ferric iron is reduced by the ferric chelate reductase fro <dig>  which is induced by iron deficiency in the root epidermis  <cit> . finally, ferrous iron is translocated into the root cell by irt <dig>  . expression of aha <dig>  fro <dig> and irt <dig> is regulated by fit  . even under strong constitutive fit expression irt <dig> and fro <dig> are induced only under iron deficient conditions  <cit>  and ectopic expression of irt <dig> and fro <dig> in leaves only occurs under iron deficiency  <cit> . hence, fit activity is post-translationally regulated  <cit> , and fit protein-protein interactions have been found that can explain this behavior . loss-of-function mutants of fit exhibit symptoms of iron starvation like chlorosis, reduced growth and lethality  <cit> .

to gain better understanding of the gene regulatory processes transcriptomic analyses with regard to iron homeostasis in a. thaliana have been performed with diverse results. iron deficiency causes activation of distinct functional modules such as the ‘transportome’ which, among others, includes genes that are involved in transition metal detoxification  <cit> . ethylene signaling-related genes and a number of iron-responsive genes are expressed in an ethylene-dependent manner such as fit, irt <dig>  nas <dig>  nas <dig>  frd <dig> and the gene of a 2og-fe oxygenase family protein  <cit> . ein3/eil <dig> appear to be required for reorganization of the photosystems to reduce photo-oxidative damage and this could also be achieved under iron deficiency by ein3/eil1-mediated increase of iron uptake  <cit> . copper deficiency causes secondary iron deficiency in arabidopsis and leads to up-regulation of irt <dig> and fro <dig>  <cit> . there is crosstalk between copper and iron uptake and phosphate starvation and there are indications for different functions of copper under iron deficiency and phosphate starvation  <cit> . micrornas were demonstrated to negatively regulate cusod  genes allowing increased cusod expression to functionally replace fesods  under iron deficiency in a. thaliana rosette leaves  <cit> . time course transcriptomic analyses showed that distinct sets of genes are up- and down-regulated at different time points after induction of iron deficiency  <cit> . another time course experiment revealed that pye  is involved in iron homeostasis by regulating genes such as fer <dig>  fer <dig>  opt <dig>  nas <dig>  fro <dig>  nramp <dig> and frd <dig>  <cit> .

based on results of many microarray analyses, the creation and analysis of co-regulatory networks of iron-responsive genes have gained increasing interest. prominent publicly available tools for such network analyses are atted ii  <cit>  and string  <cit> . co-expression and interaction network analyses may help identify further important genes as potential targets of future investigations and hence contribute to discover new aspects of the plant’s physiological reaction to iron deficiency and the respective underlying control mechanisms. for example, co-expression analyses revealed multiple subnetworks for iron homeostasis functions including the pye-bts regulon  <cit>  and iron uptake including fit targets like irt <dig>  some of these genes are robust markers for iron deficiency in a. thaliana roots  <cit> .

so far, there are only few known marker genes for iron deficiency  <cit> . a number of fit-dependent genes have been determined in a previous study using the fit- <dig> mutant  <cit>  which is a promoter t-dna insertion line with residual fit expression  <cit> . furthermore, this study has been performed using ath <dig> affymetrix chips which to this date lack a number of genes including important iron homeostasis-related genes such as fit and fro <dig>  it can be speculated that fit1- <dig> plants display a rather intermediate reaction to iron deficiency due to their residual fit expression and that not all fit-dependent genes could have been detected due to the use of ath <dig> affymetrix chips. so far, no fit over-expression line has been employed in the search for fit-dependent genes which might contribute to refinement of the search results. furthermore, it has not yet been investigated whether the developmental stage of the plants influences the dependence of genes on fit. to address these questions, we conducted transcriptomic analyses of roots of six week-old plants and six day-old seedlings that were exposed to iron-deficient or iron-sufficient conditions using the arabidopsis thaliana col- <dig> , fit- <dig>   <cit>  and ha-fit  over-expression lines  <cit> . we stringently filtered the genes by their expression patterns to obtain a comprehensive list of known and novel fit-dependent genes. this same filtering process was then used to determine genes that were affected by the presence of fit only in roots or seedlings, respectively. furthermore, we assembled a virtual dataset based on our gene expression data plus previous transcriptomic analyses to pinpoint more reliably iron deficiency-regulated marker genes and used this dataset to perform co-expression analysis.

RESULTS
overview of the microarray analyses
a number of genes that are potentially regulated by fit have been pointed out by colangelo and guerinot  <cit> . since the study has been performed with wild-type col- <dig> and the fit- <dig> knock-out mutant  <cit>  which is a promotor t-dna line, we decided to extend the analytic strategy by using a fit knock-out mutant with the strong fit- <dig> allele which is an exon t-dna knock-out mutant  <cit>   and by including the fit-overexpression line ha-fit  <dig>   <cit>  to define a full set of genes that are regulated by fit. we first analyzed the transcriptomic changes in roots of six week-old wild type, fit and ha-fit plants that were exposed to iron-sufficient  or iron-deficient  conditions for 7 days prior to harvesting and the same analyses were conducted with six-day-old whole seedlings that were grown on  +fe or -fe . using catma two-color microarrays we performed seven pairwise comparisons with three biological and two technical replicates, respectively. in three pairwise comparisons we measured the transcriptomic changes upon iron deficiency within the lines. these include wild type -fe vs. +fe, fit -fe vs. +fe and ha-fit -fe vs. +fe. we refer to these comparisons as ‘intra-line comparisons’. the four other pairwise comparisons monitor transcriptomic differences between the lines at a given iron status. they include the comparisons fit vs. wild type and ha-fit vs. wild type both at  +fe and -fe, respectively. we refer to them as ‘inter-line comparisons’. to validate the seedling data, we performed rt-qpcr with selected iron homeostasis-related genes . the root data were previously validated by  <cit> .

gene regulation in roots from six-week-old arabidopsis plants
first, when gene expression in roots of six-week-old wild type plants was analyzed, a total number of  <dig> genes was found regulated in at least one out of the seven comparisons . four thousand one hundred genes were found regulated in the intra-line comparisons . out of these,  <dig> were up-regulated  and  <dig> were down-regulated  at -fe in at least one of the comparisons. the least number of regulated genes at  +fe versus -fe was found in fit. four hundred fifty-four genes were induced and  <dig> genes repressed in fit. the number of induced and repressed genes in wild type was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, while in ha-fit  <dig> genes were induced and  <dig> genes repressed under -fe. the less pronounced transcriptomic reaction to -fe in fit can be explained by the fact that fit plants suffered from iron deficiency although they were grown on iron-sufficient medium. hence, the primary and secondary adaptations to -fe that can be observed in wild type and ha-fit may have largely been established in fit plants under  +fe already. additionally, the lack of fit may cause the inability to induce or repress a subset of genes as soon as further iron deficiency is sensed. the little overlaps between fit and the other lines and the large overlaps between wild type and ha-fit  also suggest that six-week-old fit roots react in a more distinct way to iron deficiency while wild type and ha-fit show similar responses.fig.  <dig> venn diagrams of the differentially expressed genes in the six-week-old arabidopsis roots  and six-day-old seedlings . intra-line comparisons in roots : total numbers of regulated genes , induced genes  and repressed genes . inter-line comparisons in roots : total numbers of regulated genes , induced genes  and repressed genes . intra-line comparisons in seedlings : total numbers of regulated genes , induced genes  and repressed genes . inter-line comparisons in seedlings : total numbers of regulated genes , induced genes  and repressed genes . intersection between regulated genes in roots and seedlings . the diagrams were created using the unnamed online tool provided by vib/u gent, bioinformatics & systems biology, technologiepark  <dig>  b- <dig> gent, belgium; accessible through http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/venn/




in the inter-line comparisons a total of  <dig> genes were found regulated . more genes were regulated in the inter-line comparisons  than in the intra-line comparisons . hence, differential gene expression between the different lines at a given iron supply is larger than the reaction of the respective lines to iron deficiency. out of the  <dig> regulated genes in the inter-line comparisons  <dig> were up-regulated  and  <dig> were down-regulated . thirteen percent  were found up- and down-regulated in different lines suggesting a regulation by fit. whereas the number of regulated genes was lower in fit under -fe than in the other lines, the transcriptomic changes between fit and wild type were much greater than between ha-fit and wild type. in conclusion the transcriptomes of ha-fit and wild type are more similar to each other while six-week-old fit plants display distinct transcriptomic adaptations.

gene regulation in 6-day-old arabidopsis seedlings
in six-day-old seedlings  <dig> genes were found regulated in at least one of the seven comparisons . with  <dig> genes the number of regulated genes in the inter-line comparisons of six-day-old seedlings  is 32 % less than in roots of six week-old plants. out of these,  <dig> genes were found induced  and  <dig> genes were found repressed  under -fe. the overlap between the up- and down-regulated genes was only 2 % . this suggests that gene regulation upon iron deficiency is very specific to the investigated lines. in contrast to the six-week-old roots we could not observe a large difference in the number of regulated genes that overlap between fit, wild type and ha-fit seedlings in the intra-line comparisons. all three lines shared roughly similar numbers of regulated genes, being reduced or repressed. the number of genes regulated in seedlings of the single lines did not differ as much as in roots of six-week-old plants. therefore, seedlings of the three lines react more similarly to iron deficiency than roots of adult plants.

in the inter-line comparisons  <dig> genes were found regulated . out of these,  <dig> genes were induced  and  <dig> genes were repressed  in at least one of the comparisons. the intersection between up- and down-regulated genes was 4 % . this again suggests that the observed regulations were predominantly specific to the compared lines. in contrast to the six-week-old roots where the most pronounced regulation in the intra-line comparisons was found in fit this could not be observed in the six-day-old seedlings. five hundred fifty-seven genes were induced  and  <dig> were repressed under iron-deficient conditions in fit seedlings compared to wild type  under -fe. only  <dig> genes were induced  and  <dig> genes were repressed under  +fe in fit seedlings compared to wild type . from the lower numbers of regulated genes and the higher line and comparison-specific gene regulation we conclude that the six-day-old seedlings display a transcriptomic reaction that is distinct from the differential gene expression in six-week-old roots at the large scale.

taken together, the total number of regulated genes was larger in the roots of six-week-old plants than in seedlings . seedlings may programmed to quickly increase their biomass and uptake and utilization of nutrients may be generally enhanced, which could lead to a less responsive gene regulation upon iron deficiency. iron is also stored in vacuoles of the embryo  so there is a pool of usable iron which might contribute to a less pronounced transcriptomic reaction to iron-deficient medium in young seedlings. another possible explanation could be that older roots are fully differentiated and react differently and more intensively to iron deficient conditions. however, among the  <dig> and  <dig> genes regulated in roots and seedlings, respectively, there is a comparably large intersection of  <dig> genes which still points towards a certain common transcriptomic reaction in roots and seedlings . furthermore, the numbers of regulated genes show that the influence of fit on gene expression is higher than the impact of iron deficiency alone. in roots of ha-fit and wild type more genes were regulated in -fe versus  +fe than in fit and the intersection between ha-fit and wild type was larger than between fit and the two other lines. this is in agreement with the fact that fit mutants cannot react to iron deficiency as wild type or the fit over-expressor.

hierarchical clustering of the microarray results in iron homeostasis-enriched gene clusters
to detect regulatory patterns we performed hierarchical clustering with the datasets from the six-week-old arabidopsis roots , the six-day-old seedlings  and the combination of both . we highlighted clusters in which the two confirmed fit-regulated marker genes irt <dig> and fro <dig>  <cit> , at3g <dig>  at3g <dig>  mtpa <dig> and copt <dig>  <cit>  were present.

in the dataset generated from the six-day-old seedlings the fit-regulated marker genes appeared in five clusters of which four were directly adjacent and contained a total of  <dig> genes . the fifth cluster was distinct from the others and contained  <dig> genes . in the dataset from the six-week-old roots, the marker genes were found in one cluster containing  <dig> genes . finally, in the combined dataset of both roots and seedlings, the marker genes were found in a single cluster containing  <dig> genes . when focusing on the genes that clustered with fit-regulated marker genes,  <dig> genes were found co-regulated in a robust manner in three clusters. thirty-three genes were found in two of three clusters and  <dig> genes were present in only one out of the three clusters . among the genes that were found in the clusters there were  <dig> previously fit-associated ones. ten of these were present in all three clusters,  <dig> in two of three clusters and  <dig> in one of the three clusters .fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering of the genes that were differentially regulated in six-day-old seedlings . roots of six-week-old plants  and in the combined analysis . the respectively compared lines and conditions are indicated by numbers. 1: fit +fe vs. wt  +fe. 2: fit -fe vs. wt -fe. 3: ha-fit  +fe vs. wt  +fe. 4: ha-fit -fe vs. wt -fe. 5: ha-fit -fe vs. ha-fit  +fe. 6: wt -fe vs. wt  +fe. 7: fit -fe vs. fit  +fe. the left panels show an overview over the whole cluster analysis and the right panel shows a magnified view of the respective cluster that is indicated by the red triangle and that contains known iron homeostasis-related genes. red color represents up-regulation and green color represents down-regulation. the cluster analysis has been performed with genesis  <cit> 



stringent expression pattern filtering revealed robustly fit-dependent genes
to detect novel fit targets, we performed stringent filtering of the  <dig> regulated genes in the combined dataset of roots and seedlings . at first, we reduced the list of all genes to those genes that were found regulated in at least one comparison in seedlings and roots, thereby reducing the number to  <dig> genes .

next, we performed a consecutive four-step filtering of genes by scatter plot analysis. in the first step we selected  <dig> genes that were induced by -fe in the wild type in the comparisons wt -fe vs. wt  +fe in roots and seedlings . in the second step we selected genes that were down-regulated under iron deficiency in the fit knock-out mutant compared to wild type . in the third step we filtered out genes that were up-regulated in the comparison ha-fit at -fe vs. +fe in roots and seedlings  since the fit target genes irt <dig> and fro <dig> are only induced under iron deficient conditions in a constitutive fit over-expressor  <cit> . in the last step, we selected genes that were not induced in fit vs. wt under  +fe in roots and seedlings . as a result, we ended up with  <dig> genes that we considered as positively fit-regulated . as these were found regulated by fit in roots and seedlings, we refer to them as robustly fit-induced. out of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> have been related to fit before  <cit> . however,  <dig> genes  are novel fit-induced genes previously not known in the fit regulation context . a comparison of the expression pattern analysis with the results of hierarchical clustering shows that all the genes found in the expression analysis were also present in at least one of the iron- and fit-associated clusters .fig.  <dig> four-step filtering of fit-induced genes using scatterplot analysis of log <dig> fold changes of gene expression in the respective comparison in seedlings  and roots . the blue dots represent genes that did not match the requirement and were removed in the subsequent step. the yellow dots represent gene expression patterns that matched the requirement and which were used as the input for the subsequent pattern analysis. the respective zero-points are indicated by red crosshairs. the genes filtered in a were used as input in b. the genes filtered in b were used as input in c. the genes filtered in c were used as input in d. the yellow dots in d represent the  <dig> fit-induced genes 

the genes were identified by expression pattern analysis. the selection criteria for fit-induced genes were: induced under -fe in wt, repressed in fit vs. wt at -fe, induced in ha-fit under -fe and not induced in fit vs. wt at  +fe . those for fit-repressed genes were: repressed under -fe in wt, induced in fit vs. wt at -fe, repressed in ha-fit under -fe and not repressed in fit vs. wt at  +fe . these criteria had to be met in roots and seedlings. the given values are log <dig>  up-regulation is indicated by red background, down-regulation is indicated by green background and insignificant or below threshold regulation is indicated by black background. agi codes of genes that have been previously associated with fit  <cit>  and the fit-regulated gene fro <dig>  <cit>  are written normal, the agi codes of the novel robustly fit-induced genes are written in bold and underlined. for more information on the genes see table 2

the question whether there are also fit-repressed genes was addressed with the inverse analysis as above. in the first step we selected  <dig> genes that were repressed by -fe in the wild type in the comparisons wt -fe vs. wt  +fe in roots and seedlings . in the second step we selected genes that were up-regulated under iron deficiency in the fit knock-out mutant compared to wild type . in the third step we filtered out genes that were down-regulated in the comparison ha-fit at -fe vs. +fe in roots and seedlings . in the fourth step, we selected genes that were not repressed in the absence of fit under  +fe in the comparison fit  +fe vs. wt  +fe in roots and seedlings . as a result, we ended up with  <dig> genes that we considered as repressed by fit . the two fit-repressed genes were serine carboxypeptidase-like  <dig>  and zrt/irt-like protein  <dig> . scpl proteins are annotated to have peptidase activity by sequence similarities but a number of scpl, instead of peptidase activity, act as lyases and acyltransferases in the production of secondary metabolites involved in herbivory defense or uv protection  <cit> . however, the catalytic activity and the biological processes in which scpl <dig> might be involved have not yet been determined. excess zinc causes secondary iron deficiency in a. thaliana and iron uptake genes are induced to compensate for secondary iron deficiency  <cit> . another zinc transporter, zip <dig>  belongs to the robustly fit-induced genes . it can be speculated that under iron deficiency and in situations of excess zinc, zinc homeostasis could be modulated by fit to reduce the negative effects of zinc on iron homeostasis.fig.  <dig> four-step filtering of fit-repressed genes using scatterplot analysis of log <dig> fold changes of gene expression in the respective comparison in seedlings  and roots . the blue dots represent genes that did not match the requirement and were removed in the subsequent step. the yellow dots represent gene expression patterns that matched the requirement and which were used as the input for the subsequent pattern analysis. the respective zero-points are indicated by red crosshairs. the genes filtered in a were used as input in b. the genes filtered in b were used as input in c. the genes filtered in c were used as input in d. the yellow dots in d represent the fit-repressed genes 



expression pattern analysis in six-day-old seedlings and six-week-old roots reveals distinct sets of fit-dependent genes
we used the same filtering as above to detect genes regulated in a fit-dependent manner only in six-day-old seedlings or only in six-week-old roots, respectively. in seedlings, out of the  <dig> input genes  that were found regulated in one of the comparisons,  <dig> were expressed at a higher level in wt -fe vs. +fe and expressed at a lower level in fit -fe vs. wt -fe . out of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were expressed at a higher level in the comparison ha-fit -fe vs. ha-fit  +fe and not expressed at a higher level in the comparison fit -fe vs. fit  +fe . among these  <dig> genes there were all the  <dig> previously found fit-regulated genes, as expected. hence,  <dig> genes were regulated in a fit-dependent manner exclusively in six-day-old seedlings .fig.  <dig> filtering of temporally fit-induced genes using scatterplot analysis of log <dig> fold changes of gene expression in the respective comparisons in seedlings  and roots . the blue dots represent genes that did not match the requirement and were removed in the subsequent step. the yellow dots represent gene expression patterns that matched the requirements and which were used as the input for the subsequent pattern analysis. the respective zero-points are indicated by red crosshairs. the genes filtered in a were used as input in b. the genes filtered in c were used as input in d. the yellow dots in b and d represent fit-induced genes in six-day-old seedlings   and in roots of sic-week-old plants  . the filtering steps  <dig> and  <dig> as well as  <dig> and  <dig> are combined in one graph, respectively



in roots of six-week-old plants, out of  <dig> total regulated genes   <dig> were expressed at a higher level in wt -fe vs. +fe and expressed at a lower level in fit -fe vs. wt -fe . out of these  <dig> genes  <dig> were expressed at a higher level in ha-fit -fe vs. ha-fit  +fe and not expressed at a higher level in fit -fe vs. fit  +fe . also these genes comprised the  <dig> previously determined fit-regulated genes, so that finally,  <dig> genes were found regulated in a fit-dependent manner exclusively in six-week-old roots .

among the  <dig> genes that were regulated in a fit-dependent manner specifically in seedlings there were  <dig> genes that have been previously associated with fit  <cit>   and those that were regulated in a fit-dependent manner specifically in six-week-old roots comprised  <dig> previously fit-associated genes . thus, including the above-described  <dig> robustly fit-induced genes, our results cover  <dig> out of the  <dig> previously known fit-associated genes  <cit> . three hundred eighteen fit-dependent genes were not previously described as fit-regulated genes. eleven of them were stably regulated in a fit-dependent manner in six-day-old seedlings and in six-week-old roots. forty-nine were regulated in a fit-dependent manner exclusively in six-day-old seedlings. two hundred fifty-eight genes displayed a fit-dependent regulation pattern exclusively in six-week-old roots. interestingly,  <dig> of the seedling-specific fit-dependent genes were not found regulated at all in six-week-old roots. these are considered generally seedling-specific. one hundred sixty-five of the fit-dependent genes in six-week-old roots were not found regulated at all in seedlings. these are considered generally root-specific. the generally root-specific genes contained four previously known fit targets which coincides with the fact that previously found fit targets were obtained with roots of plants in the four to six true leaf stage plus three days of treatment  <cit> . the  <dig> seedling-specific, positively fit-dependent genes comprise a total of  <dig> genes that were either previously determined as fit targets  <cit>  or that were shown to play specific roles in iron homeostasis  . additionally, these genes contain nadk <dig> , an nad kinase which is involved in de novo synthesis of nadp  <cit> . as suggested before  <cit> , reducing equivalents are required to maintain the iron uptake machinery and de novo synthesis of nadp could be increased as a response to these requirements.

we also performed the same analysis with inversed parameters to find genes that were repressed in a fit-dependent manner in either seedlings or root samples . after subtraction of the above-determined two robustly fit-repressed genes, another  <dig> genes were repressed by fit in six-week-old roots  and  <dig> genes in six-day-old seedlings . taken together, we suggest as a possible explanation that along with the robustly fit-dependent genes other distinct sets of genes could be under the control of additional but yet unknown factors which might act in different developmental stages.fig.  <dig> filtering of temporally fit-repressed genes using scatterplot analysis of log <dig> fold changes of gene expression in the respective comparisons in seedlings  and roots . the blue dots represent genes that did not match the requirement and were removed in the subsequent step. the yellow dots represent gene expression patterns that matched the requirements and which were used as the input for the subsequent pattern analysis. the respective zero-points are indicated by red crosshairs. the genes filtered in a were used as input in b. the genes filtered in c were used as input in d. the yellow dots in b and d represent fit-repressed genes in six-day-old seedlings   and in roots of sic-week-old plants  . the filtering steps  <dig> and  <dig> as well as  <dig> and  <dig> are combined in one graph, respectively



we suspected that the genes which showed the fit-dependent regulation pattern only in the seedling samples but not in the root samples  were expressed in roots where fit is active. sixty-six of these  <dig> genes were found in our study to be fit-regulated in roots. the other  <dig> genes were checked for root expression using publicly available microarray and rna-seq data via the genevestigator tool  <cit> . all  <dig> fit-induced and four fit-repressed genes out of these  <dig> genes were indeed all found expressed at low, medium or high level in root and root cell samples. only two fit-repressed genes  were found expressed at very low level in roots and were therefore excluded from any further analyses. we cannot exclude that some other genes which might have been expressed at a very low level in roots but higher level in cotyledons were not detected in our analyses.

the robustly fit-regulated genes comprise a number of transporters that are involved in iron uptake, such as irt <dig>  <cit> , or in sequestration of other bivalent metals under iron deficiency such as mtpa <dig>  <cit> , mtp <dig>  <cit>  and ireg <dig>  <cit> . copt <dig> is involved in copper uptake  <cit> . copt <dig> expression and copper uptake are increased under fe deficiency, possibly to supply cu to enzymes that use cu as a cofactor  <cit> . the exact function of the zrt/irt-like family protein zip <dig> is unknown but it could potentially be an fe or zn transporter. at5g <dig> is a putative amino acid transporter. the fit-repressed gene zip <dig> encodes a transporter that is localized to the plasmamembrane and capable of transporting zn and mn  <cit> . the role of zip <dig> in iron homeostasis is unclear but it might also be involved in zn or mn detoxification. irt <dig> is an iron transporter. irt <dig> expression is induced by iron and zinc deficiency  <cit> . pdr <dig> might be an exporter of scopoletin and derivates into the rhizosphere  <cit> .

some robustly fit-regulated genes encode enzymes. fro <dig> is a ferric chelate reductase that is part of the iron uptake machinery in arabidopsis  <cit> . pap <dig> is a purple acid phosphatase that is targeted to peroxisomes  <cit> . peroxisomes are involved in a number of metabolic pathways but also in the response to oxidative stress, ja and sa biosynthesis and indole-3-butyric acid metabolism  <cit> . hence, pap <dig> could play a role in the regulation of such processes under fe deficiency through reversible protein phosphorylation  <cit> . pap <dig> regulation also depends on jai <dig>  thus, in addition to fit, it may be regulated by myc <dig>  <cit> . at1g <dig> is a glucose-methanol-choline  oxidoreductase family protein with unclear function. prs <dig> is a phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase. according to biocyc  <cit>  the product, 5-phospho-α-d-ribose 1-diphosphate, could serve as a precursor in several nucleoside and nucleotide salvage pathways but could also be a precursor of nad+ which might be required in higher amounts under iron deficiency. iamt <dig> converts iaa to methyl-iaa . meiaa is an inactive form of iaa that gets converted back into iaa by hydrolysis  <cit> . it has been suggested that the nonpolar and mobile meiaa molecule serves to quickly change local iaa concentrations  <cit> . ugt72e <dig> is involved in the glycosylation of sinapyl aldehyde and coniferyl aldehyde  <cit> . the phenylpropanoid glucosides are better soluble than their non-glycosylated forms and ready for transport. coniferyl aldehyde and sinapyl aldehyde can be precursors of ferulic acid, sinapic acid and lignin. it has been suggested that glycosylation of these phenylpropanoids might regulate the biosynthesis of lignin and the metabolism of a number of other phenylpropanoids  <cit> . at5g <dig> is an nad-linked oxidoreductase superfamily protein of unknown function. cobl <dig> is predicted to be anchored to the plasmamembrane  <cit>  and has been previously annotated as a putative phytochelatin synthase  <cit> . the fit-regulated genes also encompass the genes of three putative e <dig> ligases: at2g <dig> and at4g <dig> are ring/u-box superfamily proteins and at3g <dig> contains a u-box. an enzymatic function of these gene products has not been demonstrated but based on the similarity to e <dig> ligases we speculate that they might be involved in the regulation of proteasome-dependent protein turnover under iron deficiency. at3g <dig> is a galactose oxidase/kelch repeat superfamily protein with high similarity to nitrile specifier proteins which are involved in glucosinolate breakdown  <cit> . at3g <dig> shows a high similarity to at3g <dig> . therefore, we speculate that it could also play a role in coumarin biosynthesis or metabolism. scpl <dig> which is the other fit-repressed gene, encodes a putative serine carboxypeptidase. enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated but the protein could play a role in proteasome-independent protein processing or turnover.

the exact molecular function of another fraction of the robustly fit-induced genes is unknown. the 14-3- <dig> protein grf <dig> has been demonstrated to act downstream of no and has been suggested to modulate fit expression in a feedback loop  <cit> . glp <dig> is a plasmodesmata-located protein. glp <dig> over-expressing plants display reduced primary root and enhanced lateral root growth  <cit> . hence, glp <dig> might be involved in altering the root architecture under iron deficiency. at4g <dig> is an sbp  family protein it contains a zinc finger domain. we speculate that this might be a regulatory protein, possibly by taking a role in mrna processing. scrl <dig> is a  <dig> amino acids long peptide and member of a family of small, secreted, cysteine rich proteins. according to uniprotkb  <cit>  it is a putative defensin-like protein. the role of scrl <dig> is unknown. at1g <dig>  the gene of an unknown protein has been demonstrated to be induced under excess zn  <cit> . the genes of five more unknown proteins are among the robustly fit-regulated proteins: at3g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at2g <dig> and at5g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at2g <dig> encode  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids long peptides that might have regulatory functions or play roles in signal transduction.

we assembled a virtual dataset using our own expression data of iron-regulated genes together with the transcriptomic data from  <dig> previous studies in which arabidopsis wild type roots or seedlings were tested for transcriptomic adaptations upon iron deficiency . from time course experiments we used the 24 h  <cit> , 48 h and 72 h data  <cit> . the reconstructed data from two publications  <cit>  were incomplete since they only contained induced genes. together,  <dig> transcriptomic analyses from  <dig> studies and our own data have been taken into account . from the collected data we assembled a virtual iron regulation dataset  in which the genes were filtered by the number of occurrences among the regulated genes and by the uniformity of their regulation. from  <dig> genes that were found regulated in at least one of the studies,  <dig> genes met the requirements of which  <dig> genes were induced and  <dig> were repressed under -fe. out of the  <dig> fit-regulated genes all but seven genes  were among the induced genes in this virtual dataset. a closer look at these seven genes showed that five of them  had not been included in the affymetrix ath <dig> chips used in the published work. the two other genes, at1g <dig> and at5g <dig>  were barely  <dig>  and 2-fold up-regulated under -fe, which makes them prone to be filtered by the oftentimes used two-fold detection threshold.

one observation that we made during the assembly of the virtual dataset was the very variable number of genes detected as regulated in the distinct analyses. the highest number of genes that was found regulated in wild type upon iron deficiency was  <dig> . a comparable number of genes was for example also detected by long et al.  <cit>  in the 48 h and 72 h time points of the time course analysis. the lowest number of genes that were found regulated upon iron deficiency in wild type roots was  <dig>  <cit>  while in transcriptomic analyses of other studies this number ranged from roughly  <dig> to  <dig> genes. the average number is ca.  <dig>  hence, it is not surprising that potentially important genes were often not detected and this might have contributed to the fact that at5g <dig> did not make it into the virtual dataset and that some of the newly fit-associated genes were not found as such. a reason for the great variability of the number of detected differentially expressed genes could be inconsistent growth conditions which may lead to a high variance between the biological replicates and consequently to insignificant regulation. interestingly, even the central regulator of iron uptake, fit, has only been found regulated in  <dig> of  <dig> analyses. this might be due to the fact that fit is relatively weakly up-regulated under iron deficiency but might also be due to the fact that this gene is only present on two of four often used microarrays to this time point. hence, detection of some important genes might also depend on the microarrays used to perform the transcriptomic analysis. the comparison of the  <dig> genes in the virtual dataset with our own data showed that we found  <dig> of these genes regulated while  <dig> genes in the virtual dataset were not found regulated in our analyses. the fact that the average virt absolute value was  <dig>  shows that our analyses with ca. 49 % covered an above-average number of these genes.

robust marker genes for iron deficiency
our virtual dataset of the transcriptomic response of wild type to iron deficiency was constructed so that the genes were not only ranked by the number of occurrences in all analyses but also according to the uniformity of their regulation across multiple analyses. setting thresholds in the process of constructing the dataset enabled us to filter the regulatory noise and pinpoint those genes that are most reliably induced upon iron deficiency in wild type arabidopsis roots and whole seedlings. according to this procedure,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes that were found regulated in at least one of the  <dig> analyses of wt -fe vs. wt  +fe in this study and all the other considered studies  are present in the virtual dataset . this number is ca. 25 % less than the average number of genes that were found regulated in all considered studies. the highest ranked up- and down-regulated genes are shown in table  <dig>  the four topmost ranked induced genes upon iron deficiency in wt are at3g <dig> , at3g <dig> , at4g <dig> , at3g <dig>  and fe-dependent oxygenase superfamily protein) and at3g <dig>  . this makes them the most reliable marker genes for iron deficiency in arabidopsis roots and seedlings. at3g <dig> and mtpa <dig> match previous findings  <cit> . at4g <dig>  at3g <dig> and at3g <dig> are almost equivalent alternatives albeit their ranking is slightly lower. although stably up-regulated under iron deficiency in roots and seedlings, not much is known about the functions at3g <dig> and at3g <dig>  due to its similarity to at3g <dig>  it can be guessed that at3g <dig> possibly also participates in coumarin biosynthesis. the consistent induction of these genes upon iron deficiency, along with the hitherto unknown at3g <dig>  they are interesting new targets for future research. interestingly, among the top  <dig> up-regulated genes  <dig> have been associated with fit by colangelo and guerinot  <cit>  and this study. only at3g <dig>  is regulated independently from fit. this fits the previous finding that bhlh <dig> is regulated together with bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig> and bhlh <dig> by the concerted action of bhlh <dig> and ilr <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> genes that were found most stably up or down-regulated in arabidopsis wild type across  <dig> studies in a total of  <dig> transcriptomic comparisons between -fe and  +fe

up-regulated genes are represented by the value  <dig>  down-regulated genes are represented by the value - <dig>  genes with no significant regulation or with regulation below the threshold of the respective study are represented by the value  <dig>  the genes with the highest virt absolute value are regarded as most stably up- or down-regulated, respectively. 1: this study . 2: this study . 3: bauer and blondet,  <dig>  <cit> . 4: ivanov et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . 5: yang et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . 6a: long et al.,  <dig>  48 h  <cit> . 6b: long et al.,  <dig>  72 h  <cit> . 6c: long et al.,  <dig>  24 h   <cit> . 7: garcia et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . 8: buckhout et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . 9a: dinneny et al.,  <dig>  48 h  <cit> . 9b: dinneny et al.,  <dig>  72 h  <cit> . 10: colangelo and guerinot,  <dig>  <cit> . 11: schuler et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . for the down-regulated genes, the analyses  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  were excluded in the calculation of the virt value since these only contained genes that were induced upon iron deficiency



among the most stably up-regulated genes under iron deficiency there is also the newly fit-associated gene at1g <dig> . glp <dig> is a germin-like protein. germin-like proteins have been associated with pathogen response  <cit> . it is possible that germin-like proteins also play a role in other stress responses such as iron deficiency. glp <dig>  also named pglp <dig>  is a component of the ncap  pathway, locates to plasmodesmata and regulates root growth  <cit> . so glp <dig> could be involved in iron signal complex translocation or in the altered root growth as a response to iron deficiency. hence it would be interesting to know whether adaptations of the root architecture to iron deficiency is disturbed by glp <dig> knock-out or glp <dig> over-expression mutants.

the three topmost ranked down-regulated genes are at5g <dig> , at4g <dig>  and at2g <dig>  . however, since their rank absolute value is lower than the five topmost induced genes they are less suitable as robust iron deficiency marker genes. however, due to its ranking the down-regulated gene that is best-suited for this purpose would be fer <dig> 

co-expression and functional analysis of the virtual dataset revealed functionally enriched regulons
out of the  <dig> genes in the virtual dataset  <dig> were found induced. this is concordant with the general observation that under iron deficiency more genes are induced than repressed. we used these genes to create co-expression networks using the string version  <dig> tool  <cit> . genes resulting in singlet nodes and networks with ≤  <dig> nodes were disregarded. one hundred sixty-nine genes grouped into networks with ≥ <dig> nodes . after rearranging the nodes we could detect a total of  <dig> networks with  <dig> to  <dig> nodes. six networks  had no connection to other networks. seven networks  were connected with each other by sharing few nodes.fig.  <dig> co-expression network built from the genes induced under -fe in the virtual dataset: regulon 1: contains members of the fit target network  <cit> . regulon 2: consists of members of the iron homeostasis network  <cit> . regulon 3: is largely composed of genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism. regulon 4: mainly comprises genes that participate in the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. regulon 5: is mostly composed of genes that are involved in rna processing and translation. regulon 6: contains mitochondrial proteins. regulon 7: is heterogeneous but contains comparably many chaperons. regulon 8: is enriched in genes involved in amino acid metabolism. regulon 9: is also heterogeneous but enriched in genes that participate in plant-pathogen interaction. regulon 10: shows no enrichment of molecular functions. regulon 11: mainly contains genes that participate in purine, lipid and aromatic compound metabolism. regulon 12: is composed of genes involved in the response to low sulfur. regulon  <dig> shows no enrichment of molecular functions. the network has been created with the string version  <dig> protein interaction database  <cit> . the confidence was set to ‘medium’  and no genes were added. the  <dig> genes induced under -fe in the virtual dataset were used as input. singlet nodes have been removed and only networks with  <dig> or more nodes are shown. the resulting network image contains  <dig> genes . for a high resolution image see additional file 6: figure s4



one closed regulon  contained genes of the fit target network  <cit> , namely irt <dig>  mtpa <dig>  fro <dig> and cyp82c <dig> . among the input genes of the virtual dataset further members of this regulon  were present. another closed regulon  was mainly composed of known members of the iron homeostasis pye-bts regulon  <cit> . only  <dig> genes of the original regulon were missing, namely pp2-a <dig>  the gene of an unknown protein  and ipt <dig>  hence, this regulon is very consistently and almost entirely induced upon iron deficiency. interestingly, this regulon contained  <dig> additional members compared to the original network, namely ireg <dig>  bhlh <dig>  djc <dig>  pgr5-like a and cgld <dig>  thus, the pye-bts regulon could be extended by  <dig> members. the third closed regulon  was mainly composed of genes that are involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism. increase of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis has been previously observed at the proteomic level  <cit> . among others, pal <dig>  pal <dig>  4cl <dig> and 4cl <dig>  which catalyze the very first steps in the phenylpropanoid pathway, were members of this regulon  and the respective proteins were also found induced upon iron deficiency. this network did not contain genes of enzymes that synthesize the final conversions. however, f6’h <dig> and another gene that has been hypothesized to also participate in coumarin biosynthesis  as well as the gene of the abc transporter pdr <dig>  which could be responsible for coumarin secretion into the rhizosphere were among the consistently iron deficiency-induced genes  but not directly connected to one of the regulons in our graph . furthermore, this regulon also contained mat <dig> which provides s-adenosylmethionine that, among others, serves as a methyl group donor in coumarin biosynthesis. among others, organic acids such as malic acid were discussed to attract soil bacteria which might contribute to enhance iron uptake  <cit> . coumarins are excreted under iron deficiency  <cit>  and coumarins also play roles under other abiotic stresses such as osmotic stress  <cit> . coumarins like scopoletin also function as phytoalexins  <cit> . besides mobilization of rhizospheric iron they could also serve to alter the rhizobiome.

at the proteomic level induction of glucose metabolism upon iron deficiency has been observed  <cit> . we identified a regulon with  <dig> nodes  that is induced under iron-deficiency. eight of the ten nodes are genes which are involved in glucose metabolism, namely g6pd <dig>  ipgam <dig>  pepc <dig>  pfk <dig>  the gene of a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase family protein , the gene of a sugar isomerase family protein , the gene of a phosphofructokinase family protein  and the gene of a pyruvate kinase family protein . additionally, fba <dig> was found induced in a neighboring and connected regulon . this clearly indicates an increase of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. both were suggested to provide energy equivalents, organic acids and reducing equivalents  <cit> .

another network with  <dig> members  contained mainly transcription and translation-related genes. among those are mdn <dig>  nrpa <dig>  nap1; <dig>  rpl3p, prh <dig>  erf1- <dig>  the gene of a ribosomal protein l <dig> family protein , the gene of the ribosomal protein s <dig> , the gene of a ribosomal protein l30/l <dig> family protein , the gene of a nonsense-mediated mrna decay nmd <dig> family protein  and the gene of a zinc finger  family protein  .

noticeable enrichment in genes that are involved in the response to low sulfur were found in a small four-member network : the tetratricopeptide repeat -like superfamily protein gene sdi <dig> , lsu <dig> , apr <dig>  and the gene of another so far uncharacterized tetratricopeptide repeat -like superfamily protein . sdi <dig> is regulated by fit specifically in seedlings . the largest regulon contained  <dig> tightly interwoven nodes . a portion of the genes in this regulon is involved in the response to various chemical, biotic and abiotic stimuli such as response to chitin, response to water deprivation or response to other organism as well as response to stress. this regulon also contained the formerly known and partially newly determined fit downstream targets pub <dig>  f6’h <dig>  gstl <dig>  rbohd, the gene of two unknown proteins  and the gene of a glycine rich protein  .

twenty-five of the fit target genes were contained in the virtual dataset and used as input genes. only three of them were present in the resulting co-expression network. since we intentionally did not add any genes, the respective bridging nodes were missing so they appeared as singlet nodes or networks with < <dig> nodes and were removed. for the same reason the fit target network and the iron homeostasis pye-bts-regulon were not connected. however, the deeper analysis of the virtual dataset showed a comparably high concordance with previous observations at the proteomic level. although the actual overlap between distinct genes and proteins in the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses is comparably low and single comparisons between the proteomic and transcriptomic regulation under iron deficiency showed a pronounced discrepancy between gene and protein regulation, the general adaptations of some metabolic and regulatory pathways that were observed at the protein level  <cit>  are mirrored at the transcriptome level.

CONCLUSIONS
fit is the central regulator of iron homeostasis in arabidopsis. until now,  <dig> genes were known to be regulated downstream of fit  <cit> . with stringent expression pattern analysis we divided the regulated genes in multiple subgroups with distinct expression patterns . we were able to define  <dig> robustly fit-induced genes among which there were  <dig> novel robustly fit-induced genes. additionally, we pinpointed two robustly fit-repressed genes. hence, for the first time a repressing effect of fit could be demonstrated. furthermore, our results indicate a total of  <dig> genes that were regulated in a fit-dependent manner either in seedlings or in six-week-old roots. fit influenced the expression of far more genes than previously demonstrated. we were able to show that the control by fit also depends on hitherto unknown factors.fig.  <dig> summary of the results of our microarray analyses. the big blue circle represents genes that were found regulated in at least one comparison in six-week-old roots and the big red circle contains genes that were found regulated in at least one comparison in six-day-old seedlings. the lower yellow oval consists of genes that were found fit-induced in six-week-old roots and the lower green oval represents the fit-induced genes in six-day-old seedlings. the intersection between the lower yellow and green ovals contains the  <dig> genes that we consider robustly fit-induced. eleven of them are novel fit-regulated genes . we also detected fit-repressed genes. the upper yellow oval represents genes that were found fit-repressed in six-week-old roots and the upper green oval contains the fit-repressed genes in six-day-old seedlings. the intersection between the upper yellow and green ovals contains the  <dig> genes that we consider robustly fit-repressed



the construction of a virtual dataset based on  <dig> distinct transcriptomic analyses allowed for removing a great portion of regulatory noise and revealed a total of  <dig> genes that are stably regulated under iron deficiency in arabidopsis roots and seedlings. four hundred thirty-seven of them were found stably induced and  <dig> stably repressed under iron deficiency with a probability of ≥  <dig> . from the induced genes in this dataset we performed co-expression analysis and found a total of  <dig> regulons with ≥  <dig> nodes. some of these regulons were enriched with functionally related genes among which parts of the previously known fit target network and the iron homeostasis pye-bts regulon could be identified. the pye-bts regulon was almost completely present and could be extended by further genes.

direct comparisons demonstrated large discrepancies between the proteomic and transcriptomic regulation  <cit>  and remodeling the ribosomal composition has been proposed to cause biased translation  <cit> . the analysis of our virtual dataset appears to confirm such remodeling processes. however, the data in the virtual dataset display considerable overlap with combined proteomic data  <cit>  at least at the functional level.

taken together this study not only provides new insight into the effects of fit abundance on gene expression but also points out the importance of redundant analyses.
