BACKGROUND
eukaryotic dna is bound by histones and organized into chromatin, which serves as the true in vivo substrate of transcription, replication and dna repair. post-translational modification of histones alters chromatin structure; for example, histone acetylation plays a central role in the unwinding of dna. histone deacetylase inhibitors  globally increase histone acetylation, relaxing chromatin structure and leading to reversible decondensation of chromatin regions  <cit> . these inhibitors of chromatin-modifying enzymes are emerging as a promising anticancer drug and already have shown anticancer effects in both pre-clinical and clinical settings  <cit> . hdaci’s are gaining increasing attention because of their therapeutic effectiveness in selectively killing cancer cells and their mild toxicity profile  <cit> .

double strand breaks  in dna occur naturally in the genome during replication and are increased by exogenous dna damaging agents. many anti-cancer therapeutics, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy agents, kill tumor cells by inducing dsbs. dsb repair is essential for cell viability and normal growth because a single unrepaired dsb can lead to programmed cell death. dsbs can be repaired through several pathways including homologous recombination, non-homologous end-joining and single strand annealing  <cit> . understanding the relationship between dsb repair and hdaci anticancer effects is important for elucidating mechanistic details of dsb repair within chromatin that have the potential to be exploited in the clinic.

sodium butyrate, a naturally occurring short-chain fatty acid that is a by-product of carbohydrate metabolism in the gut, is one of the most widely studied hdaci’s  <cit> . we studied the effect of sodium butyrate alone and combination with the dna damaging agent, etoposide. etoposide, a classical chemotherapeutic drug of cancer, interrupts the normal function of topoisomerase ii  during dna replication and generates dsbs  <cit> . we treated both healthy human embryonic kidney  <dig>  and breast cancer mcf- <dig> cells with sodium butyrate, and our results demonstrate that sodium butyrate treatment increases sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of etoposide and reduces dsb repair capacity in mcf- <dig> but not in hek <dig> cells.

RESULTS
sodium butyrate suppresses the proliferation of hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells to different extents
to verify the effects of sodium butyrate on the proliferation of hek <dig> cells and cancerous mcf- <dig> cells, we performed cck- <dig> assays. sodium butyrate suppressed both hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cell growth in a dose- and time- dependent manner . no significant effect was found with  <dig> mm sodium butyrate for either cell line; however, increasing concentrations of sodium butyrate increasingly reduced the proliferation over time. the effect appeared more dramatic for mcf- <dig> cells: at  <dig> h, no difference could be seen at any concentration for hek <dig>  whereas for mcf- <dig> cells, the  <dig>  mm  and  <dig>  mm  groups had significantly reduced a450nm values compared with the vehicle control. additionally, at  <dig> h with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate concentrations, the inhibitory rate of hek <dig>  was lower than that of mcf- <dig> cells . these findings suggest that mcf- <dig> cell growth is inhibited more strongly than hek <dig> by sodium butyrate.figure  <dig>

to directly compare the effects of sodium butyrate on mcf- <dig> versus hek <dig>  we calculated the % viability for  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate treatment at different times. mcf- <dig> cells were more greatly inhibited than hek <dig> were upon  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate treatment for  <dig> h  and upon  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate treatment for  <dig> h ,  <dig> h ,  <dig> h , and  <dig> h  . these finding verify that hek <dig> cells are more resistant than mcf- <dig> cells to the cytotoxic effects of sodium butyrate.

sodium butyrate decreases the proportion of cells in s phase for both hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells
cell proliferation is closely associated with the cell cycle, which is regulated by checkpoints that are activated by the dna damage response pathway. to determine whether the differential effects of sodium butyrate on proliferation in hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells can be explained by differential redistribution of cell cycle progression, we treated each cell line for  <dig> h with  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  mm butyrate. our results demonstrate that for both cell lines, sodium butyrate robustly induces the accumulation of cells in g <dig> and g <dig> phase with a concomitant decrease of cells in s phase . these results suggest that sodium butyrate triggers cell cycle checkpoints in both cell lines, indicating that the differences in growth response to sodium butyrate are not caused by differential control of the cell cycle.figure  <dig>

sodium butyrate suppresses cell growth synergistically with etoposide, and the effect is more dramatic for mcf- <dig> cells than for hek <dig> cells
to further verify the growth inhibitory effects of sodium butyrate in hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells, an equivalent number of each type of cell were seeded for colony forming assay after  <dig> h treatment with vehicle or  <dig>  mm butyrate in the absence or presence of  <dig>  μm etoposide, a classic dna damage reagent. because co-treatment with hdaci and topo ii inhibitor only has a synergistic effect if hdaci is administrated before topo ii inhibitor  <cit> , we exposed the cells to  <dig>  mm butyrate before etoposide was added. while each drug alone had minimal effect, the two drugs together decreased the number of colonies that grew after  <dig> days in both hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells; however, the inhibitory effects of the two drugs in combination were more obvious for mcf- <dig> cells . these results suggest that the two drugs may function synergistically to reduce cell viability and that the synergistic effects are more pronounced for cancerous mcf- <dig> cells.figure  <dig> 
sodium butyrate enhances the cytotoxic effects of etoposide, and the effect is more dramatic in mcf- <dig> cells than in hek <dig> cells.  mcf- <dig> and hek <dig> cells were pre-treated with dmso vehicle or  <dig> mm sodium butyrate for  <dig> h, and then were treated with vehicle control or  <dig>  μm etoposide for  <dig> h. after the treatment period, cells were re-seeded for colony forming assay and grown for  <dig> days. the colonies were stained with  <dig> % methylene blue for visualization. results are representative of  <dig> independent experiments.  hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells were treated for  <dig> h with  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate and then were exposed to dmso vehicle or  <dig>  μm etoposide for  <dig> h. after the treatment period, cells were re-seeded for colony forming assay. the fraction of surviving colonies was determined for the  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate groups relative to the corresponding  <dig> mm sodium butyrate group.*p<  <dig>  and **p<  <dig>  for mcf- <dig> versus hek <dig> cells, ##p<  <dig>  versus the corresponding co-treatment of  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate plus etoposide in mcf- <dig> cells. results represent the means + sd of quadruplicate experiments.



to verify these findings, we treated cells with a range of doses of sodium butyrate with or without etoposide for  <dig> h prior to plating. in the absence of etoposide, the survival fraction for the  <dig>  or  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate doses, was significantly increased for mcf- <dig> cells compared to hek <dig> cells, but the opposite trend was observed for the  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate dose . additionally, in the presence of etoposide,  <dig>  mm or  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate led to more obviously decreased colony formation for mcf- <dig> cells than for hek <dig> cells. these results suggest that under lower, non-toxic doses of butyrate, mcf- <dig> cells may have intrinsic mechanisms for protection from cell death, but that under harsher drug conditions of either higher dose sodium butyrate or a combination of sodium butyrate and etoposide, cancerous mcf- <dig> cells are more sensitive than hek <dig> cells to drug treatment.

sodium butyrate enhances etoposide-induced γ-h2ax accumulation to a greater extent in mcf- <dig> cells than in hek <dig> cells
to further investigate the potential contribution of dna dsbs to the differential growth response of mcf- <dig> and hek <dig> cells, we tested whether sodium butyrate can increase nuclear γ-h2ax foci, a marker of dna dsbs.  <dig>  mm butyrate alone did not significantly affect γ-h2ax foci in either cell line. however, the addition of  <dig> μm etoposide caused a difference in the number of foci per nucleus, which was statistical in mcf- <dig> cells, but not in hek <dig> cells . furthermore, the percentage of foci–containing cells was significantly increased in mcf- <dig>  but not hek <dig> cells . these results suggest that low dose butyrate treatment can heighten etoposide-induced dna damage and γ-h2ax accumulation to a greater extent in mcf- <dig> cells than in hek <dig> cells.figure  <dig> 
sodium butyrate statistically increases γ-h2ax foci induced by etoposide in mcf- <dig> cells but not hek <dig> cells. hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells growing on slides in  <dig> well plates were exposed to dmso vehicle or  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate for  <dig> h followed by  <dig> h dmso vehicle or  <dig> μm etoposide treatment. following the treatment period, cells were fixed and assessed for γ-h2ax foci.  the average numbers of γ-h2ax foci per cell are shown. the inset shows a representative image of staining for a γ-h2ax-positive cell.  the % of foci-containing cells with > <dig> foci was calculated. *p<  <dig>  and **p<  <dig> . results represent the mean +sd of  <dig> samples with  <dig> to  <dig> cells counted per slide.



sodium butyrate suppresses nuclear expression of dna dsb repair proteins induced by etoposide in mcf- <dig> and hek <dig> cells
to determine how sodium butyrate may affect the etoposide-induced dsb repair process, we examined the expression of proteins involved in the dna damage response pathway. because dsbs are generated in dna, which is located in the nucleus and is characterized by surrounding chromatin architecture, we assessed the expression changes in chromatin-bound and nuclear soluble protein fractions. hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells were pre-treated cells with sodium butyrate before exposure to  <dig> μm etoposide for inducing detectable dsbs and dna damage response. as shown in figure  <dig>  the chromatin-bound protein of acetyl-histone h <dig>  is increased in both hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells; however, the increase in mcf- <dig> cells is observed at a lower sodium butyrate dose. this is consistent with the greater sensitivity of mcf- <dig> cells as compared to hek <dig> cells to the sodium butyrate/etoposide combination.figure  <dig> 
sodium butyrate modulates the nuclear expression of dsb repair proteins induced by etoposide in mcf- <dig> and mel <dig> cells. hek <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells were pre-treated with dmso vehicle or  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate for  <dig> h before exposure to dmso vehicle or  <dig> μm etoposide for  <dig> h. after the treatment period, the cells were harvested, and then soluble nuclear protein and chromatin bound protein were extracted using a subcellular protein fraction kit.  <dig> μg proteins were loaded for western blot analysis. coomassie blue staining gel is shown as loading control. results are representative of three independent experiments.



the results for the other proteins we tested are more complex. chromatin-bound rad <dig> did not show reproducible modulation upon treatment with sodium butyrate and etoposide. however, rpa <dig>  ku <dig> and ctip showed variable patterns of modulation, with increase in chromatin-bound protein in hek <dig> cells at certain doses of sodium butyrate, but decrease gradually in mcf- <dig> cells follow increasing doses. the soluble nuclear portion of these proteins also showed variable trends of modulation, high doses  of sodium butyrate attenuate the upregulation of rad <dig>  rpa <dig> and ctip induced by etoposide in mcf- <dig> cells but not in hek <dig> cells. collectively, these data support the idea that the hdaci sodium butyrate is involved in the mechanism of etoposide-induced dsb damage and repair to improve its anticancer activity.

discussion
research has shown that hdaci’s affect gene transcription, induction of cell cycle arrest, differentiation, apoptosis, and inhibition of cell survival, particularly in tumor cell lines  <cit> . consistent with those data, we found that the growth of both hek <dig> cells and cancerous mcf- <dig> cells are inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner by sodium butyrate treatment alone. core histone acetylation and deacetylation are connected with checkpoint activation and repression  <cit> , and hdaci also mediates acetylation-dependent changes in non-histone proteins involved in cell cycle regulation  <cit> . our data show that the cell cycle of both hek <dig> cells and cancer mcf- <dig> cells are arrested by sodium butyrate mostly in g <dig> but also in g <dig> phases and reduced in s phase simultaneously, and a similar result has been observed in hela cells before  <cit> . so, cell cycle arrest might be one of the main reasons for the effects of sodium butyrate in promoting inhibition of proliferation.

hdac1/ <dig> play redundant and essential roles in tumor cell survival. their deletion leads to nuclear bridging, nuclear fragmentation, and mitotic catastrophe, mirroring the cytotoxic effects of hdaci’s on cancer cells  <cit> . human hdac1/ <dig> function in the dna damage response pathway to promote dna repair, and their deletion leads to hypersensitivity to dna-damaging agents and sustained dna-damage signaling  <cit> . consequently, various hdaci’s with different hdac inhibition profiles have been reported to induce dna damage  <cit> . sodium butyrate exhibits radiosensitizing effects in several cancers, such as cervical cancer and melanoma cells  <cit> . we demonstrated that low dose and short times of sodium butyrate incubation led to protection from killing in mcf- <dig> cells, as measured by colony forming assay, whereas higher doses or a combination of sodium butyrate and etoposide had clear effects on the viability of mcf- <dig> cells. higher concentrations of hdaci are believed to exert cell cycle redistribution, induction of apoptosis, and downregulation of surviving signals; whereas lower, non-toxic doses of hdaci might not be strong enough to produce dsbs, but might allow gene activation that sustains cell survival in mcf- <dig> cells. consistently,  <dig> h treatment of  <dig>  mm sodium butyrate alone did not affect cell viability, with no detectable increase in the γ-h2ax foci in either hek <dig> or cancer mcf- <dig> cells line; however, when combined with etoposide,  <dig>  mm butyrate sensitized mcf- <dig> cancer cells but not hek <dig> cells to produce more γ-h2ax foci. this chemotoxic synergy is likely due to both increased numbers of dsbs and hyperactivation of the cytotoxic arm of the dna damage response.

hdaci’s have been shown to directly downregulate homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining in many cancer cell lines  <cit> . for example, in prostate cells, treatment with hdaci downregulates the protein expression levels of brca <dig>  rad <dig> and dna-pk, and the mrna expression levels of atm, brca <dig>  brca <dig>  rad <dig> and xrcc <dig>  <cit> . synchronized hela cells in g <dig> phase have decreased non-homologous end-joining in the presence of butyrate  <cit> . additionally, hdaci’s attenuate the upregulation of ku <dig>  ku <dig> and dna-pk induced by ionizing radiation in several cancer cells  <cit> . on the other hand, the effects of hdaci on non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination proteins to date have not been observed in normal human cells.

interactions between chromatin and dna damage response proteins are central to the cellular response to dsbs. assembly factors and repair at most dna breaks in mammalian cells occurs by recruiting complexes from the nucleoplasm. therefore, the protein expression of chromatin-bound and soluble nuclear compartments reflects an underlying state of dsb repair. we found that sodium butyrate differentially affects the nuclear expression of some dsb repair proteins in mcf- <dig> and hek <dig> cells. the chromatin-bound protein of acetyl-histone h <dig> was more highly induced by sodium butyrate in the presence of etoposide for mcf- <dig> cells than for hek <dig> cells. differences were also observed for rad <dig> , ku <dig> , ctip , and rpa <dig> . however, rad <dig>  did not consistently change with increasing doses of sodium butyrate. these results indicate that the dsb repair pathway induced by etoposide is suppressed after butyrate pre-treatment in both cell lines, but that the effect is more dramatic for cancer mcf- <dig> cells. these results suggest that sodium butyrate may enhance cancerous cell mcf- <dig> killing by inhibiting recruitment of repair factors to damaged dna and reducing its repair capacity.

we have compared two different cell lines, one cancerous and one non-cancerous; however, we acknowledge that these cell lines also have differences in the species and tissue derivation. therefore, further work is needed to determine whether the differences in response that we have observed in this study may extend to other cancerous and non-cancerous cell pairs. undoubtedly, there is a range of response to sodium butyrate that is likely to vary according to the cancer type and stage of malignancy. however, our results provide important mechanistic information about how sodium butyrate may function differentially in different cells, which may explain the therapeutic efficacy and low toxicity of hdaci’s in selectively killing cancer cells  <cit> . practically, the combination of sodium butyrate may enhance the efficacy of etoposide and permit lower concentrations. additionally, the understanding of how these two drugs function synergistically may facilitate the development of future therapeutics to selectively treat cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our findings indicate that the cytotoxic effects of the hdaci sodium butyrate occur, in part, via down-regulation of dsb repair protein accessibility to the nucleus and the sites of damage, with the outcome of affecting the repair capacity. differences in the chromatin compaction in hek <dig> cells and cancer mcf- <dig> cells in response to hdaci treatment might determine distinct fates between survival and death by controlling the dsb repair pathway. consequently, sodium butyrate sensitizes cancerous mcf- <dig> more highly than hek <dig> cells to the cytotoxic effect of dna damage agents. further work is needed to elucidate the precise pathways and targets by which hdaci’s exert these chemosensitizing effects in cancer cells.
