BACKGROUND
plant-parasitic nematodes are important pests in agriculture and are found across a broad range of climatic conditions. the genus meloidogyne includes more than  <dig> species; four species – m. incognita, m. arenaria, m. javanica and m. hapla – account for approximately 95 % of the total crop area infested by this genus  <cit> . the southern root-knot nematode  is the most important parasitic nematode of upland cotton inflicting economic losses through direct damage to the plant root system and indirectly through increasing severity of other root diseases such as fusarium wilt caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum. yield loss due to rkn has dramatically increased in the u.s. from 1 % in  <dig> to  <dig>  % in  <dig>  resulting in losses of more than  <dig> million pounds  of cotton valued over $ <dig> million . recommended management practices to control rkn include crop rotation and nematicide application. the broad host-range of rkn leaves cotton growers with few profitable options to adopt crop rotation as a means of nematode management  <cit> . nematicides applied at planting fail to provide season long protection; moreover, the future availability of most widely used cotton nematicide, aldicarb, is uncertain.

host plant resistance can be an efficient rkn management tool in cotton production. resistant varieties can offer good to excellent pest control efficacy and are also environmentally sound alternatives. both cultivated and wild relatives of upland cotton have been screened to identify germplasm displaying high levels of rkn resistance  <cit> , and a few resistance sources were identified. currently, the auburn  <dig> rnr germplasm line is the most important source of rkn resistance because it displays near immunity to rkn infection. the resistance in auburn  <dig> rnr is believed to have originated from transgressive segregation in a cross between two moderately resistant parents, clevewilt  <dig> and wild mexican jack jones  <cit> . resistance in auburn  <dig> rnr was transferred to several adapted cultivars through backcrossing, resulting in the release of m-lines with improved agronomic qualities while retaining near-immunity to rkn  <cit> .

quantitative trait locus  mapping studies have identified regions on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> and the short arm of chromosome  <dig> that confer rkn resistance in auburn  <dig> rnr derived m-lines . origin of the resistance loci was traced to the two moderately resistant parents of auburn  <dig> rnr, with the qmi-c <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> inherited from clevewilt  <dig>  <cit>  and the qmi-c <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> inherited from wild mexican jack jones  <cit> . the qmi-c <dig> locus was recently fine mapped to a  <dig>  cm interval  <cit> , however the qtl region near qmi-c <dig> remains sparsely mapped  <cit> .

recent studies suggested that the qmi-c <dig> locus predominanly affects root gall suppression whereas the qmi-c <dig> locus largely reduces egg production but has little effect on galling  <cit> . further, while the main effects of each qtl appeared to serve as the major genetic basis in conferring resistance for both galling and egg production phenotypes, additive x additive epistatic interaction was important in suppressing nematode egg production, resulting in a near-immunity to infection when both qtls are present  <cit> . these studies support earlier histo-pathological observations indicating that a two-stage defense mechanism was responsible for resistance in auburn  <dig> rnr. the first stage involved suppressing the development of giant cells at 6 days post penetration and the second stage involved reducing the egg production of m. incognita females at 24 days post penetration  <cit> .

the presence of two or more unlinked resistance loci with different mechanisms in the auburn  <dig> rnr source has complicated elucidating the mode of inheritance and determining the genetic effects of each resistance gene. for example, zhou et al.  <cit>  reported that rkn resistance in the auburn  <dig> rnr source involved a partially dominant and a recessive gene. however, mcpherson et al.  <cit>  suggested that resistance in the auburn  <dig> rnr source was due to a dominant and an additive gene, and zhang et al.  <cit>  concluded that resistance was controlled by at least two additive genes. to better determine the genetic effects of each resistance locus and to investigate the hypothesis of independent resistance genes controlling plant responses to suppression of root galling and nematode reproduction in this resistance source would require testing a genetic population segregating for only a single resistance locus.

host-plant resistance to root-knot nematodes was first identified in lycopersicum peruvianum mill., a wild relative of cultivated tomato  <cit>  where a single dominant mi gene conferred resistance to three major root-knot nematodes m. arenaria, m. incognita and m. hapla. further molecular characterization of the mi gene revealed that it encodes a protein with nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat  motifs  <cit>  and triggers a hypersensitive response in the host plant. based on the amino acid motifs and their membrane spanning domains  <cit> , disease resistance genes in plants are grouped into eight classes and a majority of these genes are characterized by the presence of leucine rich repeat  motifs. the several classes of lrr-containing proteins that exist in plants have diverse overall structures and functions. they provide an early warning system for the presence of potential pathogens and activate protective immune signaling in plants  <cit> . in addition, they act as a signal amplifier in the case of tissue damage, establishing symbiotic relationships and affecting developmental processes  <cit> .

in this study, we developed a genetic population segregating only for the qmi-c <dig> resistance locus. our objectives were to:  develop and map new ssr markers to construct a dense linkage map near the qmi-c <dig> locus,  estimate the genetic effect of qmi-c <dig> on rkn resistance and  predict putative candidate genes responsible for the qmi-c <dig> resistance by identifying genes that encode for lrr-containing proteins within the qtl interval.

methods
population development
the mapping population was derived from an interspecific cross between the highly resistant upland cotton line m- <dig> rnr, and an rkn susceptible g. barbadense cultivar pima s- <dig> as described by shen et al.  <cit> . a total of 1252 f <dig> individuals were planted in a greenhouse and screened with previously published ssrs mapped to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . seven f <dig> individuals that were completely heterozygous at the qmi-c <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> as determined by five previously mapped co-dominant ssr markers   <cit>  but were homozygous for the pima s- <dig> allele at the qmi-c <dig> locus as determined by cir <dig> and cir <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  were identified. all seven plants were self-pollinated to yield a genetic population consisting of  <dig> plants segregating only for the qmi-c <dig> locus.

phenotypic screening and data analysis
the mapping population was planted in a greenhouse along with ten plants each of the parental lines, m- <dig> rnr and pima s- <dig>  as resistant and susceptible checks, respectively. the screening method to determine the level of resistance to rkn has been described previously by shen et al  <cit> . one hour prior to inoculation, nematode eggs were collected by agitating infected eggplant roots  in  <dig>  % sodium hypochlorite solution for two minutes  <cit> . three week old plants were inoculated with approximately  <dig> eggs of m. incognita race  <dig> . inoculum was distributed into two holes about  <dig>  cm deep in soil on opposite sides of the seedling and the holes were covered with soil after inoculation. the soil temperatures varied between 17 °c and 28 °c. plants were evaluated for the amount of m. incognita reproduction at  <dig> to 58 days after inoculation. phenotypic data collected included root galling index , total number of eggs extracted, and the number of eggs per gram of fresh root. roots were washed free of soil, evaluated for galling, weighed, cut into 5-cm pieces, and agitated in a 1 % v/v sodium hypochlorite solution in a 1-liter flask for four minutes  <cit> . eggs were collected and rinsed with tap water on nested 150- over 25-μm-pore sieves. root galling index  was evaluated using the  <dig> to  <dig> scale where 0 = no galling, 1 = 1–10 % of the root system galled, 2 = 11–20 % of the root system galled, up to 10 = 91–100 % of the root system galled  <cit> . roots of each plant were harvested and weighed immediately prior to extraction of eggs. eggs were extracted from the whole root system and counted. the mean number of eggs per gram of fresh root  was evaluated in order to standardize egg counts.

statistical parameters describing the population for each phenotypic trait were calculated using sas . fisher’s least significant difference  test was used to compare phenotypic means for all traits between mapping parents. data for total egg count and eggs per gram of root weight were log <dig>  transformed to achieve a normalized distribution for qtl analysis.

ssr mining and primer design
he et al.  <cit>  and gutierrez et al.  <cit>  indicated that the rkn resistance locus on chromosome  <dig> is flanked by bnl <dig> and cgr5668; therefore, we used the sequences from which these two ssrs  to blast search the genome sequence of g. raimondii at www.phytozome.net . the physical location of the qmi-c <dig> locus was found to be on the distal end of g. raimondii chromosome  <dig>  more than  <dig> mbp of sequence from the distal end of this chromosome was downloaded in fasta file format, divided into two equal segments of 2mbp each, and scanned for short repeating units using a web based microsatellite repeat finder . search parameters were: minimum number of repeats =  <dig>  minimum repeat unit length =  <dig>  maximum repeat unit length =  <dig>  fifty microsatellites that were between 10– <dig> repeats long were selected; these microsatellites are fairly uniformly distributed along the  <dig> mbp region. three hundred base pairs on each side of each microsatellite were selected for primer development using the web based batchprimer <dig> software  <cit> . primers were 20–22 nt long and designed to amplify 150–200 bp pcr products at melting temperatures between 50–55 °c. primers were commercially synthesized by eurofins mwg operon .

pcr reaction conditions were slightly modified from a previously described protocol  <cit> . pcr amplification was performed in a ptc- <dig> or ptc- <dig> thermocycler . a 10 μl reaction contained 10 ng of template dna,  <dig>  μm primer mix, 100 μm dntps,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  3u of dna polymerase, and 1x reaction buffer . the cycling conditions for pcr were 94 °c for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °c for 1 min, 55 °c for 1 min, and 72 °c for  <dig>  min. after the last cycle, reactions were incubated at 72 °c for 6 min before cooling to 4 °c. the amplified pcr products were separated by electrophoresis on a 10 % w/v non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel  and visualized by staining with silver nitrate following published procedures  <cit> .

linkage map construction and qtl mapping
procedures for linkage map development and qtl analysis were as described by he et al.  <cit> . briefly, all markers were first tested for their ability to detect polymorphism between the m- <dig> rnr and pima s- <dig> parents. primers that detected clear polymorphism between parents were utilized to genotype the entire mapping population. linkage groups were constructed using the mapmaker/exp  <dig>   <cit>  software. linkage group assembly was done using the ‘group’ command with a lod score of  <dig>  and a maximum recombination fraction of 30 cm. recombination units were converted into genetic distances by using the kosambi mapping function  <cit>  with the “error detection” command on. new markers were added to the framework using the ‘try’ and ‘compare’ commands. the final order of markers on a linkage group was confirmed using the ‘ripple’ command.

detection of qtls and estimation of various genetic parameters were performed by composite interval mapping  function implemented in the software winqtl cartographer version  <dig>   <cit> . likelihood ratio  threshold values  for declaring the presence of qtls were estimated after  <dig> permutations  <cit> . mapping was performed at 1 cm walk speed in a 10 cm window using five background cofactors selected via forward-backward stepwise regression. qtls were defined by one-lod likelihood intervals on either side of the peak position.

identification of potential candidate genes
the reference genome sequence of the d genome diploid g. raimondii and the assembled dt subgenome of the tetraploid g. hirsutum were downloaded from cottongen  along with their gff <dig> gene annotation files. the physical region between markers bnl <dig> and stv <dig> was identified in both genome sequences and scanned for annotated genes using the multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation software  <cit> . genes with leucine rich repeat  n-terminal domains were shortlisted as potential candidate genes that may be involved in a nematode resistance. protein sequences encoded by these genes were further used for blastp  search to identify protein homologs in the protein database of genbank. a neighbor joining method was utilized to construct the phylogenetic tree using the mega  <dig>  software  <cit> .

identification of single nucleotide variations
genomes of an rkn susceptible cotton line, acala ‘maxxa’ , and an rkn resistant line, ga120r1b <dig> , were sequenced at 82x and 30x read depth respectively by illumina sequencing of paired-end libraries  <cit> . using the cotton d-genome sequence as reference  <cit> , short reads were aligned using the burrows-wheeler aligner   <cit> . single nucleotide polymorphism  between candidate gene alleles in rkn resistant and susceptible lines were called with samtools/bcftools  <cit>  using reads with mapping quality > <dig> and base quality > <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS

new ssr marker development and mapping
a total of  <dig> microsatellites were found on the 4 mb region of g raimondii chromosome  <dig> between the two ssr markers bnl <dig> and cgr <dig>  thought to contain qmi-c <dig>   <dig> microsatellites were identified in the first 2 mb and  <dig> in the next 2 mb region. the distribution of di, tri, tetra, penta and hexa repeats on the two regions is presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  of the  <dig> microsatellites identified,  <dig>  di-nucleotide repeats and  <dig> were tri-nucleotide repeats with unit copy numbers from 5– <dig>  forty-five ssrs occurring at approximately uniform intervals were selected to fine-map the region between bnl <dig> and cgr <dig>  a polymorphism survey found  <dig>  ssrs to be polymorphic between m- <dig> rnr and pima s- <dig>  with  <dig>  being monomorphic and  <dig>  failing to amplify.

association analyses
because these phenotypes displayed a non-normal distribution, log transformed data for total eggs and eggs g- <dig> of root phenotypes were used for further analysis. composite interval mapping detected a major qtl for total eggs and eggs g- <dig> root near the marker ugt <dig>  with the allele from the resistant parent m- <dig> rnr increasing nematode resistance for all phenotypes. the qtl peak for both phenotypes was located at the  <dig>  cm position with a lod value of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these qtls explained up to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of phenotypic variation for total eggs and eggs g- <dig> root, respectively. the likelihood interval, circumscribed by a one lod score drop on either side of the peak, covered  <dig>  cm and was flanked by markers ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> . the d/a ratio was  <dig>  for both phenotypes, indicating that the gene action for this qtl is additive. interestingly, there was no significant association with rgi suggesting that this region has no effect on suppressing root galling.

to more precisely evaluate the genetic effect of qmi-c <dig>  all individuals homozygous for the m- <dig> rnr alleles, homozygous for the pima s- <dig> alleles and heterozygous for the entire region between bnl <dig> and stv <dig> that flanks the qmi-c <dig> locus, were selected for further analysis . in total,  <dig> individuals were completely homozygous for the m- <dig> rnr allele,  <dig> were completely homozygous for pima s- <dig> alleles and  <dig> were completely heterozygous for the region between bnl <dig> and stv <dig>  differences in phenotypic means for total eggs and eggs g- <dig> root between the two homozygous classes were highly significant . the difference in phenotypic means for total eggs and eggs g- <dig> root between the heterozygous class and the pima homozygous s- <dig> class was significant, but no significant difference was observed between the heterozygous and the m <dig> rnr homozygous class . these results suggest that although the d/a ratio indicates that the gene action was additive, this locus may have dominance effects. no significant difference was observed between the means of the three genotypic classes for rgi or root weight.fig.  <dig> mean difference between the three genotypic classes in the bnl <dig> -- stv <dig> interval. means were compared  between individuals completely homozygous for the m- <dig> allele , completely homozygous for pima s- <dig> alleles  and completely heterozygous 



potential candidate genes
more than  <dig> annotated genes were identified in the physical region between the markers bnl <dig> and stv <dig> , including  <dig> in the g. raimondii genome and  <dig> in the orthologous region from the dt subgenome of g. hirsutum  that contain leucine rich repeat  n-terminal domains. based on the g. raimondii physical map, the lrr candidate genes were distributed into three groups . most of the lrr genes within each group shared a high level of homology as indicated by their clustering in the phylogenetic tree drawn from multiple alignments of the protein coding regions of these genes . for example, all eight genes in group iii fall into a single clade in the phylogenetic tree. the genes in group i and ii were more similar to each other with two genes in group i clustering with four genes in group ii, and two genes each in group i and ii forming the third clade in the phylogenetic tree. finally, the gene gorai.005g <dig> from group i appears to be the most diverse as it does not cluster with the other groups. the  <dig> lrr genes identified in the d <dig> chromosome of g. hirsutum also showed a similar distribution on the physical map and clustering pattern in the phylogenetic tree . a blast search indicated that all genes except gorai.005g <dig> in g. raimondii showed a high degree of similarity  with at least one of the genes found in g. hirsutum. interestingly, gorai.005g <dig> did not yield any hit on the d <dig> chromosome of the g. hirsutum dt sub-genome, suggesting that it may have been lost from the tetraploid genome.table  <dig> physical locations of genes with leucine rich repeat  domain between ssr markers bnl <dig> and stv <dig> on chromosome  <dig> of g. raimondii and chromosome d <dig> of g. hirsutum

snp between rkn resistant and susceptible alleles
sequences of protein coding regions  and untranslated regions  of  <dig> genes between gorai.005g <dig> and gorai.005g <dig> , including  <dig> that contain lrr motifs, were compared between acala ‘maxxa’  and ga120r1b <dig>  lines. twenty-five snps were identified in  <dig> genes that differentiate the rkn resistant line from the susceptible acala maxxa . snp alleles in coding regions of four lrr genes in the rkn resistant line ga120r1b <dig> – gorai.005g <dig>  gorai.005g <dig>  gorai.005g <dig> and gorai.005g <dig> – resulted in changes in amino acids relative to acala maxxa .table  <dig> details of non-synonymous snps that differentiate genes from ga120r1b <dig>  and acala maxxa  lines in the qtl region flank by gorai.005g <dig> and gorai.005g032200



discussion
transgressive segregation for rkn resistance from the auburn 623rnr cotton germplasm is due to the effects of pyramiding of at least two qtls inherited from different parents; each individually confers moderate resistance, although the two qtls interact epistatically to confer near-immunity. the qmi-c <dig> and qmi-c <dig> loci map to chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . study of these loci shows that two phenotypes commonly used to measure resistance reaction to rkn, specifically galling index and egg production, could be partly genetically independent, and the qmi-c <dig> and qmi-c <dig> loci may provide resistance via different mechanisms  <cit> . full characterization of qmi-c <dig> and qmi-c <dig> will advance our understanding of defense mechanisms against parasitism from rkn, elucidate host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level, and facilitate their use in cotton improvement.

the genetic population used in the current study, consisting of 513 f2: <dig> plants, was developed using f <dig> plants that were heterozygous  at the qmi-c <dig> locus but homozygous for the susceptible parent allele at the qmi-c <dig> locus. without the confounding effects from the qmi-c <dig> qtl, our data confirmed prior qtl analyses suggesting that the qmi-c <dig> locus had a highly significant effect on egg production but little or no effect on root galling . the estimated main genetic effects for this locus was  <dig>  to  <dig>  % pv explained, lower than the  <dig> to 47 % pv explained in our earlier study when both qtls were segregating in the population  <cit> . the suppression of egg production with qmi-c <dig> alone appears to be lower in the absence of the qmi-c <dig> locus, further supporting the hypothesis that the combination of both qtls with different modes of action provides the genetic basis for transgressive segregation in the auburn 623rnr germplasm  <cit> . similar transgressive resistance to root-knot nematode resulting from epistatic interaction have been reported in cotton. for example, wang et al.  <cit>  reported that the gene rkn <dig> from the susceptible g. barbadense cultivar pima s- <dig> can significantly enhance the level of resistance to rkn in the acala nemx resistance source. in addition to cotton, interlocus interactions among main effect resistance qtls have been observed in pepper  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> , suggesting that epistasis is common and constitutes a major component of host-plant resistance to pest and disease pathogens.

the reference genome sequence of the diploid g. raimondii  <cit>  and draft sequence of the tetraploid upland cotton g. hirsutum  <cit>  have provided the cotton community an unprecedented resource for genome analysis. in this study, we were able to narrow the confidence interval for qmi-c <dig> to a  <dig>  cm region and identify  <dig> candidate resistance genes with conserved lrr domains clustering in three groups . this is not surprising as nbs-lrr genes are frequently clustered in plant genomes, and can contain genes conferring resistance to diverse pathogens, thereby acting as reservoirs of genetic variation for resistance specificities  <cit> . more importantly, of the six rkn resistance genes that have now been cloned in plants, all fall into a family of genes with the classic lrr motif typical of disease resistance genes   <cit> . not all genes may be expressed at a given time but specific r genes may be triggered by the avirulence  factor of the invading pathogen, and result in activation of a gene-for-gene resistance mechanism. since a majority of disease resistance genes are comprised of arrays of hypervariable potential ligand-binding sites, inter-allelic recombination within these arrays along with unequal recombination may be the primary mechanism behind rapid evolution of r genes and their clustering in the genome  <cit> .

to further investigate the role of these lrr genes in disease resistance, we performed a blast search of genbank to identify annotated genes from species for which the genome sequence is available. except for the gene gorai.005g <dig> and its tetraploid genome counterpart gh d02g <dig> that showed high similarity with a theobroma cacao leucine-rich repeat protein kinase family protein isoform , all other candidate genes from cluster i and ii  showed high similarity with a theobroma cacao verticillium wilt disease resistance-like protein . genes in cluster iii showed high homology with a theobroma cacao receptor like protein . this observation is not uncommon - as noted in earlier studies, r genes in a disease resistance cluster encode protein motifs that are components of signal transduction systems including genes coding for protein receptors and protein kinases. for example, the xa <dig> r gene cluster in rice is composed of more than eight lrr and protein kinase genes while the m locus in flax and rpp <dig> locus in arabidopsis are comprised of genes with nbs-lrr and toll-interleukin like protein receptor domains  <cit> . molecular studies have shown that some r genes in a disease resistance cluster share some degree of sequence similarity with other genes but are functionally divergent. for example, prf, an nbs-lrr r gene, is located within a cluster of five protein kinase homologs . both prf and pto genes are required for resistance to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  <cit> , suggesting that resistance is conferred by a haplotype rather than an individual gene.

among  <dig> positional candidate lrr genes, sequencing of the qtl interval of the resistant germplasm ga120r1b <dig>  revealed only four to have non-synonymous mutations in the coding region , suggesting these to be more probable candidates than the others. the observation that the snp containing lrr gene gorai.005g <dig> belongs to cluster-i and gorai.005g <dig>  gorai.005g <dig>  and gorai.005g <dig> belong to cluster-ii implicates one of these two clusters in rkn resistance. such non-synonymous mutations in the coding region are likely to have caused changes in the structure and function of the encoded protein, but the effects of these mutations are currently unknown.

although no nematode resistance genes have been cloned via map-based cloning in cotton, a polypeptide called meloidogyne induced cotton or mic protein has been observed to be differentially expressed in root galls of resistant and susceptible cotton plants  <cit> . further analyses on the mic protein led to the identification of the mic- <dig> gene family with at least  <dig> mic-like cdnas that encode cotton-specific pathogenesis-related proteins  <cit> . overexpression of mic- <dig> in a rkn susceptible cotton line showed 60–70 % reduction in rkn egg production when compared to non-transgenic controls  <cit> . further, overexpression of mic- <dig> does not affect rkn-induced root galling. therefore, the mic gene family produced a similar phenotypic effect as qmi-c <dig>  reducing nematode egg production but not root galling. however, our blast search against the g. hirsutum genome database using the mic sequence  showed no mic-like genes in or near the qmi-c <dig> region, precluding mic family members as candidate genes for this qtl. nonetheless, given that mic expression and effects are strongly correlated with rkn resistance, it is possible that this gene family represents a type of pathogenesis-related gene in which the effect is at the ‘end-point” in the signaling cascade that is regulated by gene annotated in the qmi-c <dig> locus.

from a practical breeding perspective, until the causal gene for qmi-c <dig> is identified, it might be prudent to simultaneously target all three clusters of r genes from the resistant parent to ensure horizontal and possibly stable rkn immunity of new cultivars. tightly linked markers are therefore important for detecting recombination events that may result in segregation of these r gene clusters, as well as to identify the zygosity of selected plants during marker-assisted selection. our results further point to the dominant nature of this qtl as indicated by non-significant differences between the heterozygous and homozygous classes of resistance alleles. this scenario can potentially render selection based solely on phenotypic observation less effective in cotton breeding populations, and may have contributed to difficulties in fixing resistance alleles during the development of the highly resistant germplasm line ga 120r1b <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we validated an earlier observation that the qmi-c <dig> resistance locus mostly suppress egg production but has little effect on galling, further supporting the hypothesis that the effectiveness of rkn resistance from auburn 623rbr is due to synergistic effects of two different mechanisms of rkn resistance. in addition, we have delimited qmi-c <dig> to a physical contig of about  <dig>  mb and identified  <dig> positional candidate llr genes, including four of which containing non-synonomous mutation in the coding region. the candidate genes identified warrant functional studies that will help in identifying and characterizing the actual qmi-c <dig> defense gene against root-knot nematodes.
