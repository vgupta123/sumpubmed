BACKGROUND
om <dig>  the type strain of the gram-negative bacterium oligotropha carboxidovorans  <cit>  , was isolated from soil of waste water sewage treatment settling ponds. om <dig> is capable of chemolithoautotrophic growth on co, co <dig>  and h <dig>  <cit>  and can utilize chemoorganoheterotrophic substrates under aerobic conditions, including the salts of pyruvate, formate, glyoxylate, lactate, ascorbate, malate, oxoglutarate, acetate, and oxalate.

initial  <dig> s rdna sequencing  <cit>  showed oligotropha carboxidovorans is phylogenetically close to two bradyrhizobiaceae: bradyrhizobium sp. btai and nitrobacter hamburgiensis x <dig>  all three species share some common gene and operons; however, these three bacteria vary greatly in metabolism. together they are an excellent model for understanding how closely related bacteria adapt to very different environments.

in addition to its utility for comparative genomics, o. carboxidovorans genes may have practical utility for bioenergy production. o. carboxidovorans is capable of utilizing syngas, which is a mixture of co, co <dig>  and h <dig> that results from gasification of organic wastes, for chemolithoautotrophic growth. microbial fermentation of this gas mixture could serve as a source for biofuels. many of the chemolithoautotrophy genes in o. carboxidovorans are located on a megaplasmid and have been studied  <cit> . the o. carboxidovorans genome will allow further studies to understand how they are regulated and how fixed carbon is assimilated into its metabolism, which could enhance use of syngas as a biofuel source.

we previously announced the o. carboxidovorans genome sequence  <cit> . at the time of our previous announcement, the chromosome sequence was in two large contigs. we now report completion of the o. carboxidovorans om <dig> genome and comparative genomics analysis with bradyrhizobium sp. btai and n. hamburgiensis x <dig>  central intermediary metabolism is similar in o. carboxidovorans, bradyrhizobium sp. btai, and n. hamburgiensis x <dig>  and o. carboxidovorans shares other features such as iron transport systems. however, o. carboxidovorans also has several unique features, particularly in fatty acid oxidation and glyoxylate cycle.

RESULTS
genome organization
closure of the last two gaps produced a  <dig> , <dig> bp long circular om <dig> chromosome  with  <dig> predicted genes. the vast majority  are protein coding;  <dig> encode rnas, and  <dig> are predicted as pseudogenes. of the  <dig> rna genes, three are rrna genes , and the rest code for trnas. twelve percent of the genome is predicted to be intergenic dna. of the om <dig> protein coding genes, tigr role categories were assigned to  <dig> %. of these,  <dig> % had a definitive functional assignment, and  <dig> % did not have a role category. in addition,  <dig> % were identified as conserved hypothetical proteins , and  <dig> % were designated as hypothetical proteins . transporter and enzyme functions are the most abundant major metabolic activities in the om <dig> genome, together making up  <dig> % of the predicted coding capacity. table  <dig> shows predicted functional classifications  of o. carboxidovorans proteins.

using rfamscan http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/ <cit>  in oligotroscope, we found  <dig> potential non-coding rna sequences, which includes small rna  . prediction of prokaryotic srnas has limitations because their sequences are diverse; therefore, identification is based on conserved sequence features in the intergenic regions . in several bacteria, srnas have important regulatory functions, including regulation of outer membrane protein expression and regulating stress responses . some srnas such as dsra and rpra are translational activators  <cit> . the regulatory rna ssra is needed for correct high-level translation of rpos  <cit> .

gc and at skew analysis http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/ori-finder/ suggests a putative replication origin  starting at position  <dig>   <cit> . the origin has a strong inflection point in the coding strand with  <dig> dnaa box motifs . this motif was identified using search parameters that allowed no more than one mismatch compared to the perfect e. coli dnaa box    <cit> .

the final sequences discussed in this paper  are available at comprehensive microbial resource  , integrated microbial genomes  http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/pub/main.cgi, kegg, and genoscope .

comparative genomics
o. carboxidovorans, n. hamburgensis, and bradyrhizobium spp. have contrasting physiologies and ecological niches. n. hamburgensis is ubiquitous in nature; it has been isolated from soil, building sandstone, and sewage sludge. it is similar to o. carboxidovorans in that it is a facultatively lithoautotrophic bacterium, but it differs from o. carboxidovorans by using nitrite to nitrate oxidation  as its autotrophic growth energy source. n. hamburgensis can also grow mixotrophically with no <dig> and organic components or heterotrophically using only organic compounds  <cit> . its current biotechnology applications include efficient transformation of fertilizer nitrogen into readily usable forms  and nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment. b. japonicum usda <dig> is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that develops a symbiotic relationship with the soybean plant glycine max by establishing root nodules  <cit> . such symbiotic relations are agriculturally important as they obviate the need for expensive and environmentally damaging fertilizer. bradyrhizobium sp. btai <dig> is a photosynthetic rhizobium that is also capable of nitrogen fixation, the first known example of such an organism  <cit> . it can form stem and root nodules.

the om <dig>  <dig> s rdna genes are most similar to those of nitrobacter hamburgensis x <dig>  followed by bradyrhizobium sp. strains usda <dig> and btai <dig> . the om <dig> genome is also more syntenic to n. hamburgensis x <dig> than bradyrhizobium . thus, overall gene synteny substantiates the rdna phylogeny, but regional synteny between the three strains varies considerably. synteny is well conserved between the three species in regions containing genes that encode conserved functions, such as abc transporters, heavy metal binding and transporter proteins, ribosomal proteins, and metabolic pathways . by contrast, synteny is less conserved in genes encoding some of the hypothetical proteins, and this difference is likely due to specific evolutionary adaption. a comparison of general genome features shows considerable variation in genome size in the three species, but otherwise the three species are similar .

*number of coding sequences  encoded in each respective genome

†percent bidirectional best hits  in each respective species compared to o. carboxidovorans. bbh are defined as gene couples encoding proteins that are considered orthologous based on either reciprocal best blast hits or satisfying a blastp alignment threshold .

‡the number of syntons shared between each respective species and o. carboxidovorans. a synton is a conserved gene cluster  shared between two bacterial genomes. all possible kinds of chromosomal rearrangements are allowed . the gap parameter, representing the maximum number of consecutive genes that are not involved in a synteny group, was set to five genes.

although these three genera have different physiologies, they show significant homology at the protein level. o. carboxidovorans om <dig> shares  <dig> orthologous proteins  with identity ≥ 70%)  <cit>  with n. hamburgensis x <dig>  and it shares  <dig> with b. japonicum usda <dig>  comparing all three strains using the same criteria, there are  <dig> proteins that have orthologs in all three strains . many of these are "housekeeping" proteins involved in dna metabolism, repair, protein synthesis, central metabolic pathways, and chaperones/heat shock proteins. many of the flagellar proteins and proteins responsible for nitrogen uptake and regulation had orthologs in all three species. membrane proteins involved in uptake of cations and heavy metal ions  and czca-like proteins ) also had orthologs in all three species.

on the other hand,  <dig> o. carboxidovorans proteins did not have similarity with any proteins from b. japonicum and n. hamburgensis   <cit>  . most of these proteins are hypothetical; some are phage integrase proteins, and a few are transcriptional regulators or permease genes responsible for transport of ions across the cell membrane. these proteins appear unique to o. carboxidovorans and could be interesting for further study to determine their roles in cellular metabolism.

mobile and extrachromosomal elements
the o. carboxidovorans genome has  <dig> putative phage or transposon related genes and two prophages as determined by prophinder. no transposons are present. this number of bacteriophage genes is lower than n. hamburgensis strain x <dig>  which has  <dig> predicted phage-related genes and six prophage genes. high genome plasticity or presence of a large number of mobile elements can indicate the need for rapid changes in response to the environment  <cit> . for example, the pseudomonas fluorescens pf- <dig> genome contains at least  <dig> large dna segments that have evolved due to genetic exchanges with other bacteria  <cit> ; these adaptations improved its ability to compete and survive in the dynamic and microbiologically complex rhizosphere. shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> also has a large number of mobile elements that provide a means of rapid adaptation  <cit> . thus, o. carboxidovorans may live in an environment where there is less selective pressure compared to n. hamburgensis. by contrast, b. japonicum strain usda <dig> does not have any predicted prophages . genes coding for mobile and extrachromosomal element functions form a distinct and major category only in n. hamburgensis and not in the other two species.

energy metabolism
many of the unique features of om <dig> energy metabolism enabling it to use co  or h <dig>  under aerobic chemolithoautotrophic conditions  <cit>  are encoded on the phcg <dig> megaplasmid. om <dig> central energy metabolism genes are similar to n. hamburgensis and b. japonicum . for energy production, om <dig> mainly uses nadh-quinone oxidoreductases by oxidative phosphorylation. the chromosome encodes a f-type atpase that is typical in bacteria and cytochrome c oxidase , which would be used in various other carbon metabolism pathways. gene responsible for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are located on the chromosome; they allow heterotrophic growth on nutrient rich media  and on minimal medium containing acetate  <cit> .

carbohydrate metabolism
genes enabling co <dig> fixation via the calvin-benson-bassham  reductive pentose phosphate cycle are located on the megaplasmid  <cit> . the om <dig> chromosome encodes a complete krebs cycle  and a complete anaplerotic glyoxylate cycle . the glyoxylate cycle functions similar to the krebs cycle but lacks enzyme steps that generate co <dig>  it is primarily an oxidative pathway that allows synthesis of carbohydrates from acetyl~scoa, which usually is derived from the oxidation of fatty acids by the β-oxidation pathway. the glyoxylate cycle is found in many β-proteobacteria, including om <dig>  particularly in organisms that grow well in media in which acetate and other krebs cycle dicarboxylic acid intermediates are the sole carbon growth source. compared to n. hamburgensis, the om <dig> chromosome encodes many gene that participate in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism alone . the difference may reflect the inability of n. hamburgenesis to utilize dicarboxylates. b. japonicum is capable of catabolizing dicarboxylic acids  <cit> ; not surprisingly, it has nearly the same number of gene as o. carboxidovorans.

fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation
all three species have enzymes participating in saturated and unsaturated fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis. in om <dig>  of the  <dig> % genes responsible for fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism,  <dig> code for fatty acid biosynthesis, and  <dig> code for fat degradation. genes present in om <dig> involved in fatty acid biosynthesis encode orthologs for acp, acca, accb, accc, accd, fabd, fabh, fabf, fabg, faba, fabz, and fabi  <cit> . om <dig> is capable of generating malonyl-coa via acetyl-coa carboxylase   and transferring malonyl-coa to acyl carrier protein by fabd. it also has genes necessary for fatty acid biosynthesis initiation , keto group reduction , dehydration , and enoyl reduction . as expected, because o. carboxidovorans, n. hamburgensis, or b. japonicum have fabi, they do not have fabk and fabl.

compared with n. hamburgensis or b. japonicum, o. carboxidovorans has fewer fatty acid oxidation enzymes . in particular, om <dig> lacks the genes that degrade long chain fatty acids. for example, o. carboxidovorans does not have a gene encoding bll <dig> , which is involved in degradation of long chain fatty acids. this gene is present in b. japonicum. fatty acid methyl ester analysis on strain om <dig> indicated an accumulation of some long chain fatty acids when it is grown under different environmental conditions . we believe the absence of these genes in o. carboxidovorans may contribute to accumulation of long chain fatty acids under certain conditions.

chemolithoautotrophic growth
o. carboxidovorans is an autotrophic organism that can grow at the expense of inorganic compounds and use co <dig> as a carbon source. its nitrogen comes from inorganic compounds such as nh <dig>  no3-, or n <dig>  during chemolithoautotrophic growth, it derives energy from oxidation of co to co <dig>  this function is encoded on a megaplasmid encoding the enzyme co dehydrogenase . plasmid-cured mutants  either lose all chemolithoautotrophic growth capabilities or cannot utilize h <dig> plus co <dig> but retain the ability of using co plus co <dig>  <cit> .

the n. hamburgensis genome contains genes that are found in carboxidotrophic bacteria. for example, it has several genes encoding cytochrome b <dig>  an important electron transfer component in aerobic carboxidotrophic bacteria  <cit> . the n. hamburgensis genome also has four gene clusters and a lone cds encoding multiple homologs of molybdopterin-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase . the largest of these clusters  has high similarity to b. japonicum usda <dig> and few other species  <cit> . in fact, the n. hamburgensis genome has more copies of mo-codh-like genes than it does of nitrite oxidoreductase   <cit> . this suggests that these proteins have a vital, but poorly understood, role in the lifestyle of n. hamburgensis. b. japonicum usda <dig> also encodes a mo-codh, and it can oxidize co at the expense of nitrate reduction under anaerobic conditions. however, it does not grow under these conditions  <cit> . in strain usda <dig>  anaerobic co uptake only occurs in the presence of nitrate, which is not a substrate or electron acceptor for anaerobic codh. therefore, no carbon fixation occurs  <cit> . thus, although these two species differ from o. carboxidovorans in their chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle, they have similar enzyme for this purpose, particularly codh.

in o. carboxidovorans, the cox genes are specifically and coordinately transcribed under chemolithoautotrophic conditions in the presence of co  <cit> ; therefore, sensing co is an important function. co sensors are typically heme-based  <cit> . two o. carboxidovorans genes encode proteins  that are putatively associated with co sensing based on sequence motifs similar to two component regulatory systems  <cit> . however, the o. carboxidovorans sequence upstream of the cox cluster does not have genes with unambiguous functions in the sensing of co or the regulation of cox genes. other species, such as azotobacter vinelandii and bradyrhizobium, contain a gene encoding cooa transcriptional receptor that may be involved in co sensing and regulating the function of co dehydrogenase  <cit> . blastp results suggest this protein belongs to the acad superfamily, and it shows similarity to acyl-coa dehydrogenases involved in lipid metabolism. o. carboxidovorans has chromosomally encoded acyl-coa dehydrogenase genes; some of them are directly involved in fatty acid metabolism . therefore, it is possible that chromosomally encoded lipid metabolism in o. carboxidovorans and plasmid-encoded co fixation are linked, but further studies are needed to confirm this.

transport and binding
one tenth of o. carboxidovorans genes are responsible for cell motility, binding, and membrane transport. by contrast, 6% of n. hamburgensis genes are in this category. this difference likely reflects their contrasting lifestyles. as an environmental species, o. carboxidovorans likely has increased need for a diversity of these functions, while the symbiotic species n. hamburgensis is in a relatively constant environment.

iron transport and related proteins are responsible for specific uptake of ferric-siderophore complexes, which are high affinity iron chelators in gram-negative bacteria. o. carboxidovorans codes for  <dig> fhu gene, ocar_ <dig>  ocar_ <dig>  and ocar_ <dig>  that are periplasmic proteins and may function as an abc-type transport mechanism driven by atp hydrolysis. the e. coli fhu system consists of four genes, designated fhua, fhuc, fhud and fhub, that are arranged in one operon  <cit> . periplasmic fhud  and cytoplasmic-membrane-associated fhuc  and fhub  are proteins necessary for the transport of ferrichrome and other fe3+-hydroxamate compounds  across the cytoplasmic membrane from the periplasm into the cytoplasm  <cit> . the protein complex tonb-exbb-exbd  <cit>  provides energy for this process. the presence of genes encoding these proteins suggests a functional iron siderophore transport complex in o. carboxidovorans.

iron acquisition is important in bacteria, both as a requirement for growth and as an environmental signal that regulates gene expression  <cit> . iron transport is especially important in nitrogen fixing bacteria  <cit>  because it increases fitness in the competitive rhizosphere  <cit> . rhizobium leguminosarum  contains a fhudcb operon for siderophore uptake  <cit> . bradyrhizobium also has iron transport systems, but unlike o. carboxidovorans, it does not utilize tonb iron transport. the presence of fe siderophores and transporter genes in non pathogenic, non-nitrogen fixing o. carboxidovorans reflects its similarity to nitrogen fixing symbiotic bacteria. the presence of these genes in o. carboxidovorans also indicates that its natural environment, like most natural environments, is restricted in iron  <cit> .

unlike n. hamburgensis, o. carboxidovorans and b. japonicum have nickel/peptide transporting genes. other o. carboxidovorans transport related proteins  are also present in n. hamburgensis and b. japonicum.

CONCLUSIONS
the previously reported sequence of the o. carboxidovorans megaplasmid revealed mechanisms for its chemolithoautotrophic growth. the complete o. carboxidovorans genome reveals metabolic pathways used during heterotrophic growth and how chemolithoautotrophic growth is linked with central metabolism. further research is needed to identify genes involved in the regulation of chemolithoautotrophic growth versus heterotrophic growth.

o. carboxidovorans appears to be adapted to a relatively stable microenvironment because its genome contains remarkably few phage- or transposon-related genes in comparison to n. hamburgensis and other soil bacteria. the lack of any typical gram-negative communication system based on acylated homoserine lactones  also suggests an exclusive microhabitat, similar to azoarcus bh <dig>  <cit> . production of ahls is not uncommon in environmental bacteria, but it only occurs in some microhabitats under appropriate conditions  <cit> . another important characteristic of the o. carboxidovorans genome is the presence of tonb-dependent receptors for iron transport across the cell membrane, unlike n. hamburgensis and b. japonicum. the role of iron acquisition in o. carboxidovorans metabolism is another very interesting area for future research.

o. carboxidovorans, n. hamburgensis, and b. japonicum each have unique genetic pathways that enable them to have specialized functions such as co oxidation, nitrite oxidation, and n <dig> fixation. these genetic pathways have historically been the most well studied from these species. however, comparison of their genomes reveals that there are many metabolic pathways that are conserved between these closely related species. comparison of these three genomes also revealed previously unknown differences in the "conserved" metabolic pathways. the cumulative effects of these metabolic differences, along with the unique pathways, allow these phylogenetically related species to adapt to diverse environments  <cit> . therefore, the unique pathways for these organisms must be understood in the context of their respective genomes. this current analysis is only a beginning, and further work on the function of o. carboxidovorans proteins will yield valuable information on how this species survives in its unique environment and how it adapts to both heterotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic lifestyles.
