BACKGROUND
response times to visual stimuli can be extremely fast in some cases. however, there is also considerable intra-individual variability in response times across trials, even under identical experimental conditions. which neural processes can account for these behavioral differences? why do we manage to be fast on some trials but not on others?

experimental findings suggest that processing of visual information may be extremly rapid, leaving an upper limit of 10– <dig> ms for information transfer between two neurons at successive levels of the visual processing hierarchy  <cit> . this implies that processing must be achieved using the very first spikes of a neuronal stimulus response based on an ensemble code rather than a rate code  <cit> . such effective and fast transfer demands synchronous arrival of several spikes at the same target neuron, propagated from different source neurons that were activated by the respective stimulus. however, the membrane potential of neurons is randomly fluctuating around its resting potential. therefore, without a synchronization of those fluctuations even a coherent wave of input spikes to a certain processing stage will result in an increasingly scattered spike distribution at the input to the next processing stage. in this case reliable processing of a stimulus can only be achieved based on a time consuming rate code. rodemann and körner  <cit>  demonstrated in a neural network simulation that stimulus-locked, evoked gamma band responses  can be the expression of a phase reset of ongoing neuronal activity after a visual stimulus, which results in strong synchronization of spiking activity in the stimulated neuronal population. in this case processing of the stimulus can be based on instantaneous evaluation of an ensemble code, which results in much faster responses.

so far egbrs have been studied in perceptual tasks in both auditory  <cit>  and visual modalities  <cit> . in these experiments it could be shown that although egbrs are highly dependent on physical parameters of the stimulation  <cit> , they are significantly modulated by top down factors like attention  <cit>  or memory  <cit> . although the early time window in which they occur and the simulation performed by rodemann and körner  <cit>  render egbrs a possible mechanism for fast response initiation, studies that link egbrs and response times are rare. there is only indirect evidence regarding this topic. in studies investigating egbrs in schizophrenic patients, decreased phase-locking is accompanied by prolongated reaction times in patients compared to healthy controls  <cit> . furthermore, studies that investigated stimulus induced amplitude modulations in the gamma range found relations between such amplitude modulations and reaction time  <cit> . such later amplitude modulations of oscillations in the gamma range, so called induced gamma oscillations  <cit>  have been associated with a wide range of cognitive processes  <cit>  and learning  <cit> .

in the current study, we directly investigated the idea that phase-locked, evoked gbrs are relevant for speeded responses. participants were asked to respond as fast as possible to large black squares presented on a white screen, while their electroencephalogram  was recorded. trials in which the participants were able to respond fast were analyzed separately from trials with slower reactions. we hypothesized that egbrs would be enhanced in those trials, in which the participants were able to respond fast, compared to trials, in which participants responded slower. we further explored whether these effects could be explained by amplitude modulations in the single trials or whether they were due to an increase in phase-locking to the onset of the stimulus.

RESULTS
response times
median response times ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> ms . mean response times for fast trials  and slow trials  are indicated in figures  <dig> and  <dig> as vertical dotted lines. a histogram of all response times can be found at the top of figure  <dig> 

event related potentials
a slowly increasing negative potential could be observed preceding the stimulus. in order to test whether this negativity is influenced by the degree of expectancy of the next stimulus, we used three different randomizations of the inter stimulus interval : a uniform distribution, for which all possible isis had the same probability, a gaussian distribution with a clear peak for medium latency isis, an exponential distribution, for which very long isis are possible, but most isis are relatively short. these three isi distributions have been shown to influence the slow stimulus preceding potentials  <cit> . in the current data, however, the negative potential did not differ between different randomizations of the inter stimulus interval  =  <dig> ) and was most pronounced over central electrodes. separating the trials into fast and slow responses revealed that this slowly increasing negative potential was large for fast response trials, but nearly absent for slow response trials . comparing the mean amplitude in the last  <dig> ms preceding stimulus onset in a central region of interest  yielded a highly significant difference  = - <dig> , p < 10-4).

in addition also a difference in p1-n <dig> peak to peak amplitude is visible in figure  <dig>  however, this difference was only visible in a small subset of three participants. in some participants no p1-n <dig> complex could be found or the effect was even reversed. a statistical analysis of those participants for which a p1-n <dig> pattern could be observed did not yield a significant difference between fast and slow responses  = - <dig> ).

gamma band responses
gamma band responses  were quantified by three different parameters. evoked gbrs  were obtained from the wavelet transform of the averaged event-related potential, gamma band amplitude modulation  was computed as the average amplitude of the single trial wavelet transforms and gamma band phase-locking  was quantified as phase-average  of the single trial wavelet transforms.

a clear egbr could be observed over posterior and central areas. this response peaked between  <dig> and  <dig> ms at frequencies between  <dig> and  <dig> hz . evoked gbrs were generally more pronounced over the posterior roi than over the central roi  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). no significant differences for different isi randomizations were found  =  <dig> ). separating the trials into fast and slow behavioral responses yielded a clear difference in the egbr : in trials with fast behavioral responses, egbrs were larger in amplitude  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and earlier in latency  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) than in trials with slow behavioral responses. no significant differences were observed in the baseline level of gamma activity  =  <dig> ).

we analyzed phase-locking  and amplitude modulation  patterns in the same time window to investigate whether the effects of egbr were due to an increased phase-locking to the stimulus or due to amplitude modulations in the single trials. pl was significantly enhanced for the fast response trials compared to the slow response trials  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , fig. 4). pl was also more pronounced over the posterior roi than over the central roi  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). am was more pronounced over the posterior roi  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), too. however, am between  <dig> and  <dig> ms did not depend on the response speed  =  <dig> ). in a later time window between  <dig> and  <dig> ms am was significantly modulated by reponse speed  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , fig. 3). note however, that this effect was found in most cases after the participants had already pressed the button.

relation between stimulus preceding erp and gamma band response
in order to disentangle the relation between the slow negative potential and the egbr, we split the trials into two groups of trials with either a pronounced prestimulus negativity  or a weak prestimulus negativity  and analyzed egbrs separately in both subsets. no significant egbr differences were found between trials with strong and weak negativity  =  <dig> ). as depicted in figure  <dig>  this was due to large standard deviations between single participants. inspection of single participant data revealed that out of  <dig> participants, five demonstrated enhanced egbrs in strong negativity trials compared to weak negativity trials, while two participants demonstrated decreased egbrs in strong negativity trials compared to weak negativity trials. for the remaining four participants egbrs were virtually the same for strong negativity trials compared to weak negativity trials.

discussion
in the current study we demonstrated that both erps and egbrs are increased for fast compared to slow responses. we further pointed out that the enhanced egbrs for fast responses are a result of increased phase-locking to the stimulus, rather than stimulus related amplitude modulations.

we observed a slowly increasing potential that appeared  <dig> ms before stimulus onset and was terminated by the participant's response. on the one hand, this negativity could reflect a contingent negative variation . such a cnv would be expected to vary between blocks depending on the degree of expectancy, i.e. the distribution of inter stimulus intervals  <cit> . however, in our paradigm no significant differences were found between the three blocks which differed in the distribution of inter stimulus intervals and thus in the degree of expectancy. on the other hand, the negativity might also reflect a readiness potential  <cit> . however, a readiness potential should normally be observed preceding self paced movements  <cit> , whereas in the current study no such movements were required. we demonstrated that this negative potential differed between fast and slow responses, which is in line with previous studies, that showed that reaction times are short if a pronounced readiness potential can be observed  <cit> . deecke et al.  <cit>  have argued that readiness potentials are recordable only before voluntary movements  but not or to a lesser degree before reactions as in case of the reaction to a visual stimulus. however, other authors also described readiness potentials before reactions to a stimulus  <cit> . thus, based on our current data we cannot discriminate between a cnv and a readiness potential that preceds the stimulus. however, both types of slow potentials have been associated with anticipatory motor preparation  <cit> . 

we could extend the erp findings by showing a relation between evoked gamma oscillations and reaction time, indicating that fast reactions are associated with highly phase-locked gamma oscillations. in line with the erp results this effect was observed at central electrodes  <cit> . however, in the current study we found significant differences between fast and slow response trials also at posterior electrodes. previous results indicating that egbrs are highly dependend on physical factors of the stimulus, linked egbrs to very early visual processing  <cit> . this extends the findings obtained from erp analysis by showing that fast and slow response trials differ already in earlier stages of visual processing. the current findings are in line with both findings from the auditory modality  <cit>  as well as models that link rapid feedforward processing of spike timings with phase-locked gamma oscillations  <cit> . furthermore, gbrs seem to be facilitated when participants are required to make a behavioral response compared to when no responses are required  <cit> . it might be argued that the observed effects are, although triggered by the stimulus, mainly a manifestation of anticipation of the stimulus. such an effect should take place already before the stimulus would be applied. it has been reported that such anticipation effects vary with the randomization procedure used for inter stimulus intervals  <cit> . although different randomization procedures were used for the different blocks of the experiment, no effect of the randomization procedure was observed. this favors the interpretation that the electrophysiological effects are related to facilitation of stimulus processing rather than anticipation of stimulus timing in fast response trials.

due to its similar frequency characteristics, electromyographic activity is usually a big problem when dealing with eeg gamma activity. we visually inspected every trial before analysis to make sure that there was no excessive high frequency activity in the data. still there might be muscular activity in the data, with an amplitude that is too low to be detected visually. however, the gamma activity in the present study displays one important property that cannot be expected for such low amplitude muscular activity: it is phase-locked to a visual stimulus while showing virtually no power increase. furthermore, low amplitude muscular activity would be expected to have a constant tonus which would be subtracted with the baseline. therefore, we believe that the results described here can be related to cerebral processing rather than muscular artifacts.

how do the slow negative potential and the findings about phase-locked gamma oscillations fit together? while slow negative potentials like cnv or readiness potential are usually associated with anticipatory motor activity , egbrs have been linked to early visual processing  <cit> . these two phenomena might be related in two different ways: first, the slow negativity might be a prerequisite for an enhanced egbr, which in turn enables the participant to perform a rapid response. second, the slow negativity as well as the egbr might independently facilitate rapid reactions. the fact, that we did not find significant differences in egbr for different magnitudes of the slow negativity in single trials, is in line with the second alternative. however, further research in this direction is needed to reveal the exact relations between these two brain signals and behavioral performance. in such an experiment the stimulus preceding erp and poststimulus gamma band activity could be dissociated by experimentally suppressing one of these phenomena independently by an appropriate experimental manipulation.

we observed very fast reaction times in the current study. compared to the reaction times of 400– <dig> ms  observed in simple cognitive experiments,  <dig> ms might seem very short. it should be kept in mind, that in the current experiment no stimulus discrimination was necessary. taking into account the high contrast and very low spatial frequency  of the stimuli used in the present study, reaction times around  <dig> ms fit well with the expected reaction times as estimated by plainis and murray  <cit> .

previous studies reported correlations of either gamma peak latency  <cit>  or amplitude  <cit>  with reaction time. however, in both studies effects were observed after the participant's average response time. furthermore, these studies did not analyze phase-locking of the activity. although our data also include late, stimulus induced amplitude modulations, which also vary with reaction time, we show that fast and slow response trials differ with respect to their phase-locking even before amplitude modulations start to play a role. furthermore, the fact that the am effect on gamma oscillations only becomes significant after the participants already have responded, excludes the latter from being a causal factor determining the reaction time differences. these results might indicate that phase-locked gbrs play an important role in fast detection of visual stimuli, whereas induced gbrs might be linked to further refinement of this initial classification, as has been suggested by recent models of visual processing  <cit> .

the current results demonstrate that rapid visual processing in preparation for a speeded response is  dependent on stimulus locked activity in the gamma range. however, the actual behavior in a cognitive task is most probably based on the interactions of different oscillatory processes. indeed, movement seems to be related to other, probably lower frequencies  <cit> . also the integration of different modalities to a coherent movement has been associated with oscillatory activity at lower frequencies  <cit> . in contrast, the observed effects in the gamma range seem primarily related to visual processing, albeit preparing the brain for speeded responses. it has been argued recently that high frequency oscillations which are evoked in early sensory areas need to be down modulated to lower frequencies that then cover more distributed areas of the brain  <cit> . thus, it seems plausible to assume that early evoked gamma activity might be necessary but not sufficient for speeded responses and later activity of lower frequency must mediate the results of the enhanced visual processing to motor areas. indeed, lower frequencies during a visual motor integration task have been reported to be highly synchronized between visual and motor areas in cats  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we could show that fast reaction times are associated with enhanced phase-locking in the gamma range. evoked gamma activity might thus be related to a fast mode of visual processing.
