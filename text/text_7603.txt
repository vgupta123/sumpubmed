BACKGROUND
metaplasia is the appearance of a tissue type foreign to the organ it arises in and results from a reprogramming of stem cells that reside in normal tissues  <cit> . in the human breast, it is observed in both benign and malignant lesions. the malignant version, metaplastic carcinoma of the breast , encompasses squamous carcinoma, squamous carcinoma with spindle cell metaplasia, carcinoma with chondroid differentiation, carcinoma with osseous differentiation, and adenocarcinoma with spindle cell differentiation  <cit> . not infrequently, the metaplasia is not limited to one cell type . gwin et al. studied twenty-one infiltrating duct carcinomas with chondroid differentiation; fully a third also exhibited squamous metaplasia  <cit> . an interesting observation is that cartilage and bone formation are relatively frequent occurrences in the mammary tumors of cats and dogs  <cit> . canine tumors containing epithelial and mesenchymal components are hypothesized to arise from stem cells based on the fact that the two components are monoclonal  <cit> . bone and cartilage are also observed in pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary glands and rarely in calcifying epithelioma of malherbe  <cit> . metaplasia also arises in the context of chronic inflammation; for example, h. pylori infection of the gastric mucosa induces intestinal metaplasia. this conversion is hypothesized to be the result of a change in the expression of one or several transcription factors in the adult stem cell  <cit> .

the susan g. komen for the cure® tissue bank at the iu simon cancer center is a biorepository established expressly for the acquisition of normal, i.e. healthy, breast tissue from volunteer donors  <cit> . to increase the availability of a prohibitively limited resource, epithelial  and stromal cells  were established from the donated tissue. the primary, non-transformed epithelial cells, the focus of this study, were characterized by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and in vitro cell culture. during this process it has become apparent that all of the epithelial cells tested have the ability to differentiate in vitro into a variety of cell types when plated in or on biologic matrices. classic germ layer theory posits that some of these cell types have their origin in the ectoderm but others are derived from the mesoderm or neural crest. however, here is a growing body of evidence to suggest that explant culture conditions, such as were utilized to isolate these cells, select cells that are multipotent  <cit> . the plasticity of the epithelial cells developed by ktb mimics that seen in mcb and it is tempting to postulate that these tumors arise from similar multipotent or plastic cells as described in the present study.

methods
all studies were approved by the indiana university institutional review board . all research was carried out in compliance with the helsinki declaration.

experimental design
the original purpose of this study was the characterization of the epithelial cells derived from the donated normal breast tissue. initial studies included immunohistochemistry to determine the expression of epithelial cytokeratins, myoepithelial markers and hormone receptors; and ploidy analysis. the first evidence of plasticity was observed in the matrigel® cultures. this observation shifted the focus of this study to an assay of the epithelial plasticity. as matrigel® is a mixture of collagen, laminin and fibronectin, cells were grown on each of these surfaces to determine if any one of these proteins was responsible for the transformed phenotype. preliminary cell type identifications were made based upon shape, size and intracellular components on phase contrast microscopy. colorimetric assays and immunohistochemistry were utilized to provide additional evidence as to the cells’ identities. alcian blue is routinely used in pathology laboratories to identify cartilage and nestin expression is a marker of neural stem cells. however, as both have been noted in normal breast epithelium  <cit> , additional makers of chondrocytic and neural differentiation that are specific to the cell type were assayed.

cell culture
after obtaining informed consent, a  <dig> gauge core needle was used to obtain breast tissue  from  <dig> healthy female volunteers with no history of breast disease   <cit> . the tissue was immediately homogenized, digested with collagenase and hyaluronidase, and cultured using selective media and trypsinization to differentiate the epithelial cells from stromal cells as previously described  <cit> . the ktb hme cells  were obtained from frozen stocks, thawed, and suspended in wit-p media  unless otherwise stated  then plated onto primaria-coated t- <dig> flasks . the majority of experiments used cells prior to passage four; no follow-up experiments utilized cells beyond passage  <dig>  cells were cultured at 37°c, in an environment of 95% relative humidity and 5% co <dig>

RESULTS
k-hme cells express common epithelial and myoepithelial markers by immunohistochemistry
the k-hme cells are epithelial in nature  and do not express estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor  or her <dig> protein . cytokeratin 5/ <dig> expression was observed in cells cultured in both megm and wit-p media; cytokeratin 8/ <dig> expression was seen only when grown in wit-p. the expression of other proteins varied as a function of the growth media; for example vimentin expression was observed in wit-p media but not in megm . the epithelial cells expressed p <dig>  a protein essential for the self-renewal of stem cells of epithelia  <cit> , and a marker of myoepithelial cells  <cit> ; and alpha smooth muscle actin, which is associated with both myoepithelial cells and myofibroblasts.

the majority of k-hme cells are diploid
the majority of the established breast epithelial cells are diploid  as evidenced by two chromosome  <dig> and two chromosome x signals. a small percentage of cells  were tetraploid at passage  <dig> and exhibited four x signals and four chromosome  <dig> signals each .

cell phenotype of the k-hme cells in the presence of basement membrane proteins
when the cells were placed in the center of a sandwich of matrigel®, they uniformly formed spheres 37 mm-325 mm in diameter after 10 days in culture . hematoxylin and eosin staining of the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections of these spheres reveals a keratinizing squamous epithelium . the cells initially appeared to be forming duct-like structures, which disappeared over the 10 days of culture .

immunohistochemistry was repeated on sections showing squamous differentiation. in comparison to cells in 2-d culture, these cells strongly expressed the epidermal growth factor receptor and vimentin; did not express sma  and contained a few, scattered cd <dig> positive cells . single cells appeared ck <dig> positive; however, those cells within the spheres were very weakly ck  <dig> positive; er, pr, her <dig> remained negative.

three of the twelve k-hme cell strains  were chosen for additional characterization. photomicrographs of the breast tissue from two of these three donors are presented in additional file 3: figure s2a,b. these cells were grown on collagen i, collagen iv, laminin, fibronectin and primaria surfaces. the most striking differentiation was observed on the collagen iv and fibronectin surfaces, although this was observed on primaria dishes as well. multiple cell types were observed including large, multinucleated cells, which resembled osteoclasts both by morphology and upon tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining . incubation of the cell cultures with alcian blue highlighted the presence of glycosaminoglycans in another subfraction of the cells . immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against collagen ii and x revealed granular cytoplasmic staining in a fraction of cells when grown on collagen or primaria . the phenotype of the cells, the positive staining with alcian blue, and the production of collagen ii and x suggest chondrocytic differentiation  <cit> .

spindle-shape cells with oil red o positive cytoplasmic vacuoles consistent with adipocytes were observed . in other areas of the cell culture, a sheet of myod expressing cells was seen . numerous cells with long, dendritic processes expressed nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein , and beta-iii tubulin . immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed at the neuron-specific nuclear protein neun   <cit>  showed uniform nuclear staining  in a fraction of cells when grown on collagen but not on primaria. a subpopulation of cells expressed the melanocyte differentiation antigen mart- <dig> . the addition of bmp <dig> or neuregulin to the culture media did not enhance osseous or neural differentiation, respectively. growth of the cells in melanocyte growth medium did not promote the expression of mart- <dig> 

clonality
analysis of a single cell suspension of k-hme  <dig> cells revealed that the various cell types are represented in a colony that grew from a single cell . each cell type represented only a fraction of the total cells . flow cytometric analysis determined that 25% of cells expressed cd <dig>   <cit>  and 5% expressed the calcitonin r   <cit>  .

organotypic culture
in organotypic culture, k-hme cells partially differentiated into a stratified epithelium that showed e-cadherin rich junctions characteristic of skin . keratin  <dig>  a suprabasal keratin of the epidermis, was also noted . similarly, expression of involucrin , a crosslinking protein found in upper strata of epidermis and keratin- <dig> , a basal-layer keratin of epidermis, were observed in the top and bottom layers, respectively. p <dig>  which is expressed in the basal layer of epidermis, also was present in the k-hme cells at the bottom of the tissue . there was no change in staining after  <dig>   <dig> and 7 days of emersion. cell division occurred in cells near the basal layer with approximately 10% of the basal cells undergoing cell division .

expression of breast stem cell markers in k-hme cells
flow cytometry for stem cells markers showed the cells were cd49f positive and epcam negative . k-hme cells grown in wit-p media were positive for telomerase activity, an indicator of progenitor cell characteristics, while those grown in megm were negative unless transduced with exogenous htert.  quantitative pcr revealed that the k-hme cells express the stem makers klf <dig>  nanog, notch <dig> and sox <dig> at levels similar to embryonic stem cells . data is normalized to gapdh. expression of embryonic stem cell markers nanog and oct <dig> was verified at the protein level and was observed in a fraction of the cells by immunohistochemistry . oct <dig> rna expression was lower by qpcr, which is consistent with the ihc as not all cells expressed the protein. immunofluorescence using antibodies against nucleostemin confirmed the presence of multiple nucleoli in a subset of cells .

discussion
identification of the mammary epithelial stem cell has been a “source of much contention”  <cit> . methodologies utilized for the identification include mammosphere culture, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and recapitulation of the mammary gland by single cells in vivo. “since metaplasia often involves the transformation of undifferentiated stem or progenitor cells…”  <cit> , metaplastic ability may be another attribute of these cells.

while no single marker can be considered to be cell-type specific, the preponderance of evidence presented in this paper including cellular phenotype, colorimetric reactions and multiple immunostains suggest that the k-hme cells are multipotent. explant culture conditions select cells that are multipotent. multipotency has been demonstrated for explant cultures of the hair follicle, bronchiole and intestine  <cit> . sieber-blum and colleagues showed that cells from bulge explants of whiskers of transgenic mice are pluripotent, differentiating into neurons, smooth muscle, schwann cell, melanocytes, and chondrocytes  <cit> . using wnt10cre/r26r double transgenic mice, they were able to trace these cells to the neural crest. a subsequent study by yu et al. confirmed differentiation into neurons, muscle cells, endothelial cell, adipocytes and osteoblasts  <cit> . the cell line developed by delgado and colleagues from bronchiole explants co-express differentiation markers for multiple cell types of the lung and give rise to all lung epithelial lineages  <cit> . intestinal explant cultures or “organoids” are multi-cellular aggregates of intestinal mucosal progenitors and putative mucosal stem cells, which have been seeded onto scaffolds in tissue engineering experiments to create neointestines  <cit> . the cells most competent to emerge from tissue explant cultures would appear to be the basal cells, which display the highest level of potency  <cit> . similarly, the epithelial cells described herein established by outgrowth from explant culture are basal and retain multipotency. both delgado et al. and yu et al. suggest that their isolated cells resemble multipotent embryonic progenitors either in terms multi-lineage differentiation and/or expression of nanog and oct <dig>  human lung stem cells isolated by wang and colleagues express nanog, oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig> and klf <dig>  <cit> . indeed, expression of oct <dig> and nanog has been reported in rare cells within adult tissues including bone marrow, epidermis, bronchial epithelium, myocardium, pancreas and testes  <cit> . likewise a subpopulation of k-hme cells express oct <dig> and nanog. k-hme cells also display multiple nucleoli, a characteristic of human embryonic stem cells  <cit> .

a recent publication from the laboratory of tlsty and colleagues reports findings similar to the ones presented in this manuscript  <cit> . the cells utilized for their studies were isolated by a completely different method, i.e., the selection by flow cytometry of cells from reduction mammoplasties that, after lineage depletion, are cd <dig> positive and cd <dig> negative. these cells are also pluripotent and express a number of genes reported to confer multi-and pluipotency at levels comparable to embryonic stem cells. although there are a number of similarities to the k-hmes there are also some differences, e.g., their cells are epcam positive, and differentiation was effected by the addition of growth factors and supplements to the media. these differences notwithstanding, the fact that two independent laboratories using different methods have identified pluripotent, plastic cells in the breast lends credence to this discovery.

the epithelial cells described herein are metaplastic. they express basal cytokeratins  <dig> and  <dig>  which are the hallmarks of the basal cells of stratified squamous epithelia  <cit> , and myoepithelial cells/basal cells of the normal breast. however, a subset of luminal cells in the terminal ducts also express cytokeratin  <dig>  <cit> . in the mouse mammary gland, the basal cell fraction is enriched in mammary stem cells  <cit> . the expression of the luminal cytokeratins  <dig> and  <dig>  and of vimentin in wit-p media is of interest. wit-p media in contrast to megm contains all-trans retinoic acid , which has been shown to significantly increase the expression of cytokeratins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  vimentin and icam- <dig> in oral gingival cells in vitro <cit> . it also increases expression of these cytokeratins in t47d breast cancer cells  <cit> . ince, weinberg and colleagues, selected primary breast epithelial cells by their growth in wit-p media and transfected them with htert, sv- <dig> lt/st and h-ras-v <dig>  the xenograft tumors formed from these cells expressed cytokeratins  <dig> and  <dig> and resembled human invasive ductal carcinoma  <cit> . those cells selected by their growth in megm resulted in tumors with squamous differentiation that lacked ck8/ <dig> expression. p <dig>  which is routinely used as a marker of myoepithelial cells, is strongly expressed by the k-hme cells. however, it is also a stem cell marker in the epidermis and limbal epithelium  <cit> . in p63-null mice, the epithelium fails to stratify, and mammary buds or other epidermal appendages do not form  <cit> . pellegrini and colleagues have argued that the phenotype of p63-null mice should be ascribed to a failure to maintain the stem cell compartment. this would suggest that p <dig> marks the stem cells of the epidermal appendages, which includes the mammary glands, as well as the epidermis and limbic epithelium. it is entirely possible that the k-hme cells are the p <dig>  ck <dig> and nestin positive cells identified by li et al. in the basal/myoepithelial layer of the mammary gland  <cit> . k-hme cells are epcam negative and cd49f positive by facs analysis, an immunophenotype ascribed by lim et al. to the mammary stem cell enriched population  <cit> .

the differentiation of human breast cells obtained from outgrowth of organoids into squames is well described  <cit> . the ability of these basal cells to form “relatively large spherical structures with a central core of squamous metaplasia” on basement membrane has also been noted  <cit> . squamous differentiation of cells isolated from reduction mammoplasty has more recently been reported  <cit> . both nasal airway stem cells and tracheal airway stem cells form spheres of squamous cells “akin to squamous cell metaplasia” when grown on matrigel®  <cit> . it should be noted that the squamous differentiation observed in our study is contextual: in the middle of matrigel®, the phenotype most closely represents a squamous carcinoma of the skin. this keratin pearl-like structure is the form assumed by squamous metaplasia in the breast both in benign  or malignant  lesions. it is also observed in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, esophagus, anus and even in a minority of tibial adamantinomas  <cit> . this suggests a commonality in the pathophysiology of the metaplasia, that is, that basal/stem cells on becoming surrounded on all sides by basement membrane/stroma form keratin pearl structures. the fact that this is observed in normal cells raises the possibility that metaplasia is a property of all epithelia, which is kept in check by the normal microenvironment and tissue polarity. in a study conducted by miyoshi and colleagues using transgenic mice, stabilization of β-catenin expression through mmtv-cre-induced deletion of exon  <dig> results in reversion to epidermis and squamous metaplasia in the mammary tumors that develop therein  <cit> . this squamous metaplasia resembles that seen in the matrigel® sandwich cultures in that there is a cyst-like/nodular structure with keratin in the middle encircled by a stratified epithelium. these investigators suggest that the differentiation of the mammary gland as a secretory epithelium requires suppression of β-catenin signaling, and absent this repression the phenotype reverts to epidermis  <cit> . in other words, the default genetic program for epithelial cells in the breast may be epidermis and their differentiation into a gland requires, at a minimum, the repression of the default program, if not a concomitant activation of a program that results in gland formation.

how can differentiation into these various cell types be explained? boecker and colleagues recently published a study of salivary gland tumors of the breast and histologically similar tumors of the salivary and lacrimal glands  <cit> . they utilized triple immunofluorescence to trace the lineage of cells within these tumors. the results of their study led them to hypothesize that there are k5/k14/p63-positive progenitor cells within these neoplasms that give rise to glandular epithelial cells, myoepithelial cells, as well as the squamous and mesenchymal cells. the k-hme cells may be the progenitor cells hypothesized by boecker et al.

eric neilson has suggested that terminal differentiation rather than being an end point is a lay-over point: “…terminal differentiation is really just an evolutionary pause maintained by signaling events, transcription factors, and genomic setting”  <cit> . neilson and his colleague, michael zeisberg, have proposed that epithelial plasticity is comprised of two processes: metaplasia  and epithelial-mesenchymal transition   <cit> . emt can further be divided into three types  <cit> . type  <dig> emt functions in early embryogenesis when it is involved in gastrulation and neural crest migration. type  <dig> emt is the formation of fibroblasts from secondary epithelial cells or endothelial cells. type  <dig> emt facilitates the metastasis of epithelial cells in a process that includes the loss of intercellular connections, migration and the establishment of residence in a secondary location.

metaplasia is often composed of the tissue type normally derived from the neighboring region of the embryo  <cit> . a dividing line forms between these two regions at a point where an inducer is at its threshold concentration  <cit> . if a stem cell originally residing in this region and now in one of the resulting adult tissues retains bidirectional tissue potential, an inciting event after birth, e.g., infection, wounding, tissue regeneration, could tip the balance resulting in an homeotic transformation. the cells that eventually form the breast begin their life as ectoderm, which borders the neural crest. neural crest cells form cartilage, bone, nerve and smooth muscle in face and cranium; as well as the peripheral nervous system and a number of neuroendocrine cell types. pleomorphic adenomas, tumors that also display areas of bone and cartilage formation, are hypothesized to have a contribution from neural crest cells based upon the expression of gfap  <cit> . human genetic disorders may provide an additional clue. mutation of p <dig> is responsible for limb-mammary syndrome , the features of which include hypoplasia/aplasia of the mammary gland and cleft palate. that the phenotype is manifest in tissues derived from the ectoderm and neural crest suggests that the mutation was present in a progenitor of both lineages. are the k-hmes just such a cell? if so, the observed phenotypic plasticity observed in the k-hme cells may be more akin to type  <dig> rather than type  <dig> emt.

CONCLUSIONS
within the normal human breast are epithelial cells with phenotypic plasticity. they are likely the source of metaplasia. metaplasia may offer a wealth of clues with regard to normal and pathologic physiology. the human body has regulated differentiation so that specialized tissues and cells are generated and located/arranged to enable the organism to survive, thrive and function. when this differentiation goes awry, it should prompt the question: why? what is a chondrocyte doing in the breast? many tissues have been shown to contain cells that are pluri/multipotent. these cells function in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis or the restoration of tissue integrity following wounding or remodeling. the plasticity of the k-hme cells mimics that seen in mcb and it is tempting to postulate that these tumors arise from similar multipotent or plastic cells. the differentiation repertoire of these cells may be circumscribed under normal physiologic conditions by the tissue microenvironment. alteration of the microenvironment by a mechanical and/or disease processes may release the restrictions enabling the metaplastic phenotype to become evident.
