BACKGROUND
multiple sclerosis  continues to be a serious public health problem without a curative treatment. although the development of ms is attributed to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, the exact cause of ms is not completely understood  <cit> . the goals of ms therapy are to modify the disease course and to manage relapses and symptoms. for example, finglolimod has been shown to reduce relapses of ms patients by preventing pathogenic lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous systems   <cit> . however, a substantial proportion of ms patients do not respond well to the currently available medications. therefore, identification of new targets for management of ms is urgently needed.

fatty acid binding proteins  constitute a family of cytosolic proteins which exhibit distinct tissue specificity  <cit> . as lipid chaperones, fabps can regulate cellular metabolism and function through enabling fatty acid distribution and coordinating their responses. since fatty acids function both as energy sources and as signaling molecules, fabps have been identified as central regulators of metabolic and inflammatory pathways  <cit>  using a mouse model of ms, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , we have demonstrated that mice deficient of fabps, in particular epidermal fabp , have protection from the development of eae  <cit> . e-fabp deficient dendritic cells  are defective in producing proinflammatory cytokines and in promoting th <dig> and th <dig> responses  <cit> . furthermore, we have shown that cd4+ t cells deficient for e-fabp exhibit increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor γ , which suppressed th <dig> differentiation while enhancing regulatory t cell  development  <cit> . based on our previous studies, it has become clear that the protection against eae exhibited by e-fabp-deficient mice is due to the e-fabp-deficient phenotype of the antigen presenting cells  as well as of the t cells, themselves. thus, e-fabp represents a new therapeutic target for eae treatment, and modulating e-fabp activity may provide an attractive strategy for ms management.

recently, many studies have reported the development of specific inhibitors which can modify fabp functions  <cit> . for example, bms <dig>  a small molecule inhibitor of adipose fabp , has been shown to treat atherosclerosis and type  <dig> diabetes in mouse models  <cit> , suggesting that inhibition of fabp activity is an effective approach for treatment of inflammatory diseases and metabolic syndromes. herein, we identified 2-- <dig> -dimethoxy- <dig> -dihydropyrimidoisoquinolin-4-one  as a novel e-fabp inhibitor using a ligand docking computational method  <cit> . experimental evidence further confirmed that ei- <dig> effectively inhibited e-fabp activity in both dcs and t cells and potently reduced eae symptoms in mouse models.

flow cytometric and cell sorting
immune cells from draining lymph nodes or spleens were subjected to surface staining or cultured with pma , ionomycin  and golgiplug  for 6 hours, then harvested for surface and intracellular staining. flow cytometric data were collected with a bd facs calibur™. flow cytometric data analyses were performed with flowjo . the following antibodies were used for cell staining: anti-cd <dig> , anti-cd <dig> , anti-mhc class ii , anti-ifn-g , anti-il- <dig> , anti-foxp <dig> , anti-cd <dig>  and anti-cd <dig> .

molecular docking model of e-fabp/inhibitor interactions
in our previous studies, we demonstrated that e-fabp deficient t cells exhibit elevated expression of pparγ, but e-fabp deficiency has no impact on parβ/δ expression  <cit> . thus, we tested all the potential e-fabp inhibitors by measuring alterations of ppar expression in t cells. while all the tested inhibitors displayed minimal impact on parβ/δ expression , ei- <dig> remarkably enhanced pparγ expression in cd4+ t cells and bmdcs . these data suggested that ei- <dig>  is able to functionally inhibit e-fabp activity. we next analyzed the binding characteristics of ei- <dig> with e-fabp obtained from the molecular docking studies . in this model, the binding pocket of e-fabp remained virtually unaltered and the ei- <dig> adopted the u-shaped conformation similar to what has been observed in the previous complex structures with fatty acid ligands . the main e-fabp/ei- <dig> interactions consisted of five hydrogen bonds with the side chains of tyr <dig>  arg <dig>  and try <dig> and backbone carbonyl oxygen of met <dig> as well as van der waals interactions with the surrounding hydrophobic residues. tyr <dig> made a bidentate hydrogen bonding interactions with o <dig> and o <dig> of the inhibitor, maintaining the same interaction with the polar head group of the natural fatty acid ligands. altogether, our data indicate that ei- <dig> displayed an optimal fitting with favorable interactions around the lipid binding pocket of e-fabp.figure  <dig> screening of e-fabp inhibitors. t cells were isolated and incubated with potential e-fabp inhibitors  or dmso control for overnight. expression of pparβ/δ  and pparγ  was examined by realtime-pcr .  confocal analysis of pparγ protein expression in bmdcs cultured either with dmso or with ei- <dig>  for 18 hours .  chemical structure of the ei- <dig> - <dig> -dimethoxy- <dig> -dihydropyrimidoisoquinolin-4-one).  analysis of ei-03/e-fabp complex by a computational model. the protein was shown as a ribbon diagram and a partially transparent surface representation while the docked compound is shown as a ball-and-stick model. the inset shows a zoomed-in view of the main interactions highlighted by a network of hydrogen bonds.



ei- <dig> binds directly to e-fabp
on the basis of tight interactions of the ei-03/e-fabp complex indicated by the molecular docking model, we next performed an in vitro binding assay with the recombinant protein to confirm the direct binding of ei- <dig> to e-fabp. to obtain pure apo-proteins, residual endogenous ligands of e-fabp were removed by lipidex-chromatography . the direct binding of ei- <dig> to e-fabp was measured by the thermal shift assay  <cit> . in this assay, the thermal stability of e-fabp was monitored by measuring the fluorescent signal of sypro orange in the presence or absence of the potential ligands. as shown in figure 2b, ei- <dig> binding to e-fabp increased the temperature of unfolding of e-fabp  in a dose-dependent manner. in contrast, there was no change of tm in the presence of compound ei- <dig> under the same conditions, suggesting a specific binding of ei- <dig> to e-fabp. consistent with the molecular modeling results, these data further indicate that ei- <dig> specifically binds to e-fabp and thus inhibits its lipid-binding activity.figure  <dig> ei- <dig> binds directly to e-fabp.  a coomasie-stained gel depicting the purity of e-recombinant fabp protein  used in thermal shift assays.  normalized melting curves depicting enhanced thermal stability of e-fabp in the presence of ei- <dig>  as is evident by a tm shift of  <dig> - <dig> °c when compared to ei- <dig> or dmso control. the data shown are representative of three independent experiments.



ei- <dig> regulates cytokine production by dcs
we have shown that e-fabp-deficient dcs exhibited reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines, but increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . to this end, we examined whether dcs with inhibition of e-fabp activity by ei- <dig> mimicked the phenotype of e-fabp-deficient dcs. first, we determined the effects of ei- <dig> on cytokine production by dcs stimulated with mtb, the most common adjuvant used in eae models. ei- <dig> treatment significantly suppressed tnfα and il- <dig> production by dcs at the transcriptional levels . in contrast, mrna levels of il- <dig>  but not il-1β, by dcs was greatly elevated in the presence of ei- <dig> . when we collected the cultural supernatants and measured each cytokine by elisa, we confirmed above effects of ei- <dig> treatment of dcs at the protein levels . we next analyzed the effects of ei- <dig> on expression of surface molecules which were critical for ag presentation on dcs. as shown in figure 3i-k, in response to mtb stimulation, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and mhc class ii molecules were greatly upregulated. however, ei- <dig> treatment had no impact on the expression of mhc class ii, cd <dig> and cd <dig> on mtb-stimulated dcs, suggesting a minimal effect of ei- <dig> on antigen presentation. therefore, ei- <dig> may regulate the function of antigen present cells by controlling the balance of cytokine production.figure  <dig> ei- <dig> regulates cytokine production by dcs.  bone-marrow derived dcs were stimulated with mtb  for 6 hours with the indicated concentrations of ei- <dig> or the dmso control. cells were lyzed for rna extraction and cultural supernatants were collected for protein quantification. relative mrna levels of tnfα , il- <dig> , il- <dig>  and il-1β  were measured by real-time pcr. protein levels of each cytokine  were quantitated by elisa . for measuring expression of co-stimulatory molecules and mhcii expression, mtb-stimulated dcs with or without ei- <dig> were analyzed for cd <dig> , cd <dig>  and mhc ii  levels with flow cytometry with respective antibodies. the results shown are representative of three independent experiments.



ei- <dig> inhibits the differentiation of effector t cells
as e-fabp expression in t cells promotes th <dig> differentiation  <cit> , we reasoned that inhibition of e-fabp with ei- <dig> suppressed the production of il- <dig> by cd4+ t cells. to this end, we differentiated naïve cd4+ t cells into th <dig> cells with tgf-β/il- <dig> in the presence or absence of ei- <dig>  indeed, ei- <dig> treatment significantly inhibited th <dig> differentiation in vitro . of note, when we induced naïve t cells to th <dig> cells in vitro, ifnγ production in th <dig> cells was significantly reduced . to further confirm this observation, we directly cultured lymphocytes from lymph nodes  with anti-cd3/cd <dig> antibodies in the presence of ei- <dig>  and showed that ifnγ production from cd4+ t cells was also significantly inhibited by ei- <dig> treatment . in contrast, foxp3+ tregs were upregulated with treatment of ei- <dig> , which was consistent with what we observed in our previous studies  <cit> . interestingly, cd8+ t cells from lns also exhibited impaired ifnγ production in response to ei- <dig> treatment . moreover, cells isolated from spleen showed similar phenotypes in the presence of ei- <dig> . thus, our data demonstrated that ei- <dig> treatment counter-regulates the balance of effector t cells and tregs in vitro. due to the pathogenic roles of th <dig> and th <dig> cells and protective roles of tregs in eae development  <cit> , these results imply that ei- <dig> could potentially inhibit eae development through suppressing effector t cells and promoting tregs, thereby representing a good drug candidate for eae treatment.figure  <dig> ei- <dig> regulates t cell differentiation. naïve cd4+ t cells were differentiated into th <dig> with il- <dig>  and tgfβ  or th <dig> with il- <dig>  for 3 days in the presence or absence of ei- <dig> . production of il- <dig>  and ifnγ  was measured by intracellular flow staining. lymphocytes from lns were cultured with anti-cd3/cd <dig> antibody in the presence or absence of ei- <dig>  for 3 days. foxp <dig>  and ifnγ  in cd4+ t cells were examined by intracellular staining.  naïve cd8+ t cells were differentiated with il- <dig>  in the presence or absence of ei- <dig>  for 3 days. ifnγ production was examined by intracellular flow staining. each panel displays a representative of three experiments yielding similar results. data are presented as the means ± sd.



ei- <dig> treatment ameliorates eae symptoms in vivo
given the evidence that ei- <dig> regulated the functions of both apcs and t cells, suggesting a favorable outcome for treatment of autoimmune diseases, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of ei- <dig> using eae models in vivo. we treated mice with ei- <dig> concurrent with mog immunization on day  <dig> of the eae model. we found that ei- <dig> treatment significantly ameliorated the severity of eae disease with reduced clinical scores . further analyses showed that mice treated with ei- <dig> exhibited reduced numbers of total infiltrated leukocytes, into the cns as compared to mice treated with vehicle control . more specifically, the percentage of cd4+ t cells, cd8+ t cells and cd11b+mhcii+ populations in ei- <dig> treated mice was significantly lower than those in control mice . consistent with the in vitro data, cd4+ t cells in the cns of ei-03-treated mice exhibited reduced production of il- <dig> and ifnγ, but elevated expression of foxp <dig>  when compared to those from control mice . in addition, cd8+ t cells in the cns also displayed reduced expression of ifnγ in ei- <dig> treated mice .figure  <dig> amelioration of eae is associated with reduced leucocyte infiltration and effector t cell function in ei-03-treated mice.  c57b/ <dig> mice treated with ei- <dig> or dmso vehicle control  were immunized with mog35– <dig> and scored daily postimmunization .  eae mice from ei-03-treated or control mice were sacrificed at the peak of the disease and total numbers of mononuclear cells in the cns of those mice were measured with an automatic cell-counter. percentage of infiltrated cd4+ t cells , cd8+ t cells  and cd11b+mhcii+ cells  were analyzed by flow cytometric staining. the expression of il- <dig>  ifnγ  and foxp <dig>  in cns-infiltrated cd4+ t cells were determined using intracellular staining.  total numbers of ifnγ+ cd8+ t cells in cns were measured using intracellular staining. the results shown are representative of three independent experiments .



notably, when we treated mice with different dosages of ei- <dig>  we found that there was no additional benefit at a higher dosage  of ei- <dig> , suggesting that an effective efficacy of ei- <dig> treatment for eae development can be achieved at a relative lower dosage . as ms treatment is usually initiated after the disease has been active and diagnosed, we further investigated whether administration of ei- <dig> was effective for treating active eae. we started ei- <dig> treatment when mice began to show symptoms of eae. as shown in figure 6b, ei- <dig> treatment was able to effectively inhibit eae symptoms even when administered during active disease. taken together, our results indicate that ei- <dig> is effective in suppressing eae development and progression, thus representing a promising drug candidate for treatment of patients with ms.figure  <dig> ei- <dig> treatment inhibits eae disease.  different dosages of ei- <dig> were administered to mice at the beginning of eae induction with mog immunization . vehicle dmso was administered as non-treated controls. clinical scores were measured daily .  ei- <dig> compounds  were administered to mice on day  <dig> after eae induction with mog . average clinical scores were shown in panel b .



discussion
ms is an autoimmune disease of the cns in which axons are demyelinated due to an attack of activated immune cells. although many cell types, including oligodendrocytes, epithelial cells and microglial cells, are involved in the pathogenesis of ms, the crosstalk between innate apcs and autoreactive lymphocytes plays a central role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune responses. while ms is traditionally thought to be a th1-cell mediated autoimmune disease, characterized by ifnγ inflammation, recent work has demonstrated that other t cell subsets also contribute to the development of ms. for example, th <dig> cells can produce il- <dig> and il- <dig> to disrupt blood brain barrier  and induce neuronal dysfunction in the cns  <cit> ; cd8+ t cells have also been shown to be critical for the pathogenesis of ms  <cit> . in contrast, these effector t cell-mediated immune responses are normally suppressed by tregs, which are able to maintain immune homeostasis of cns immunity  <cit> . thus, ms is associated with unbalanced t cell subsets marked by increased frequency of effector t cells and decreased treg cells. as ms is a heterogeneous disease involving various factors and numerous pathogenic cells, treatments targeting a single mediator or one specific cell type may not be optimal for treatment of ms patients. herein, we provide evidence that targeting e-fabp, a lipid carrier expressed abundantly in immune cells, represents a novel strategy for modulating the functions of dcs and t cells for the management of eae.

in our previous studies, we have demonstrated that e-fabp expression in cd4+ t cells regulates t cell differentiation and function  <cit> . in addition, e-fabp is also highly expressed in dcs, promoting proinflammatory cytokine production. during the development of eae, e-fabp is further upregulated in the cns, contributing to eae pathogenesis through promoting il- <dig> and ifnγ inflammation  <cit> . thus, e-fabp overexpression in immune cells may dysregulate their functions to promote autoreactivity for the development of autoimmune diseases. by taking advantage of the efficient molecular docking methods  <cit> , we performed a systematic search of more than  <dig> million drug-like compounds. based on the ranking of the conformational, orientational and positional space of the docked compounds, we selected the very best candidates predicted to bind the lipid binding pocket of e-fabp and experimentally tested their functions with both in vitro and in vivo models. as e-fabp regulates t cell differentiation through impacting nuclear receptor pparγ expression/activity  <cit> , we first investigated whether these compounds actively enhanced pparγ expression. indeed, we showed that ei- <dig> acted like an inhibitor of e-fabp in that it significantly increased pparγ expression, mimicking the heightened pparγ levels observed in e-fabp deficient t cells. more importantly, we showed that ei- <dig> was able to directly bind to the lipid binding pocket of e-fabp , thus functioning as a specific inhibitor of e-fabp.

to examine the effect of ei- <dig> on apc functions, we found that ei- <dig> potently inhibited proinflammatory cytokine tnfα production by mtb-treated dcs. in contrast, anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> was upregulated by ei- <dig> treatment. this phenotype is consistent with what we have seen in e-fabp deficient dcs. since dcs also express a-fabp, although to a much less extent, we cannot exclude the possibility that ei- <dig> may bind to a-fabp contributing to the observed phenotype. as ei- <dig> treatment may impair the production of th-differentiation related cytokines, such as il- <dig>  by dcs, we further analyzed the effect of ei- <dig> on t cell differentiation. we confirmed that ei- <dig> decreases il- <dig> production while increasing foxp <dig> expression in t cells, which corresponds to the effects observed in e-fabp deficient t cells. notably, e-fabp is the predominant fabp member in t cells , it is reasonable to speculate that ei- <dig> may also regulate t cell differentiation through direct targeting e-fabp in t cells. in addition, ei- <dig> was also showed to inhibit ifnγ production both in cd4+ t cells and in cd8+ t cells, implying that ei- <dig> may exhibit a more broad effect in controlling the function of dcs and the differentiation of t cell subsets for treatment of t cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.

as studies of eae have contributed to several approved ms medications  <cit> , we used this model to further investigate the therapeutic efficacy of ei- <dig> in vivo. ei- <dig> administration significantly suppresses the clinical symptoms during eae development . further analysis showed that ei- <dig> treatment inhibited t cell migration into the cns as well as the production of il- <dig> and ifnγ of the infiltrated populations. notably, when we titrated the dosage of ei- <dig> in mouse models, we did not observe any apparent toxicity of ei- <dig> even at the dose of 20 mg/kg/day, regarding overall health condition, total cell counts and apoptotic status of peripheral blood, and activation markers of immune cells . thus, ei- <dig> is well tolerated when applied in vivo. since pparγ agonists have been shown to reduce clinical signs of eae  <cit> , we cannot exclude the possibility that administration of ei- <dig> in vivo may directly activate other targets, including pparγ to exert its protective effects on eae development. in addition, it warrants further investigation as to whether ei- <dig> treatment affects functions of other populations besides dcs and t cells during eae development.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have demonstrated that targeting e-fabp represents a novel strategy for treatment of eae. using a molecular docking model, we identified a new e-fabp inhibitor which can regulate functions of both apcs and t cells. further analyses with animal models of ms revealed a therapeutic benefit of the inhibitor in ameliorating clinical symptoms of eae through inhibition of lymphocyte migration and pathogenic functions. thus, these data suggest that this newly-identified inhibitor may be a new drug candidate for treatment of ms and other autoimmune diseases.
