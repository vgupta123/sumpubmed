BACKGROUND
sugarcane  is a large, perennial, tropical or subtropical grass widely grown primarily for sugar production worldwide. it is a first generation biofuel crop used for ethanol and biomass production as an alternative source of energy  <cit> . about 75% of the world's sugar  supply is from sugarcane and the other 25% from sugar beet . as a c <dig> plant, sugarcane has been recognized as one of the world's most efficient crops in converting solar energy into chemical energy, specialized for sucrose production  <cit> . sugarcane is also among the crops having the most favorable energy input/output ratio  <cit> .

the genus saccharum includes six species based on morphology, chromosome numbers, and geographical distribution, and they are s. spontaneum, s. robustum, s. officinarum, s. barberi, s. sinense, and s. edule. recent genomic and molecular cytogenetic data provided strong evidence that s. barberi and s. sinense were derived from interspecific hybridization between s. officinarum and s. spontaneum  <cit> . although it has not been proven, s. edule is thought to be an intergeneric hybrid between either s. officinarum or s. robustum with a related genus that might account for its aborted inflorescence  <cit> . s. robustum and s. spontaneum are two wild species with different basic chromosomes, x =  <dig> and x =  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these two wild species have a wide range of chromosome numbers and ploidy levels with 2n =  <dig> -  <dig> for s. robustum and 2n =  <dig> -  <dig> for s. spontaneum  <cit> . s. robustum has been postulated to be the progenitor of the high sugar content species, s. officinarum . the unique basic chromosome number and distinctive dna fingerprints of s. spontaneum from the other species of saccharum are the reasons for a proposal to divide this genus to only two species, s. spontaneum as traditionally defined and s. officinarum including all other species and interspecific hybrids  <cit> .

hybrids derived from crosses involving a female s. officinarum  and a male s. spontaneum exhibit 2n + n transmission, conserving the entire genome of s. officinarum, a phenomena known as female restitution  <cit> . the female restitution remains true in the first backcross between female s. officinarum and the 2n + n f <dig>  but breaks down at the subsequent backcross. dutch breeders in early  <dig> utilized this unusual phenomenon in sugarcane improvement to integrate resistance genes for biotic and abiotic stresses from the wild species s. spontaneum and quickly recover the high sugar content property by a few backcrosses to the high sugar content species s. officinarum. for that reason, all current sugarcane cultivars in production are hybrids with 80-90% of the genome from s. officinarum and 10-20% of the genome from s. spontaneum  <cit> .

the complexity of the autopolyploid genome and the interspecific hybridization of modern cultivars hindered progress in genetic/genomic research and the application of genomic tools in sugarcane breeding programs. the only sugarcane bacterial artificial chromosome  library that we are aware of was constructed from the hybrid cultivar r <dig> with 2n =  <dig> chromosomes. given an estimated genome size of  <dig> gb, this bac library provided  <dig> × coverage of the polyploid genome and 14× coverage of the basic chromosome set  <cit> . sugarcane cultivars used for genetic mapping often have more than  <dig> chromosomes, and all sugarcane genetic maps constructed to date appear to be incomplete, due to the large number of chromosomes to be mapped and the limited genomic sequences available for developing markers  <cit> . this deficiency has restricted the application of marker-assisted selection, because much of the genome cannot yet be scanned for target traits. however, sugarcane is in the forefront as a source of biofuel, and this has stimulated investment from both private and public sectors in sugarcane research. coupled with the decreased cost of dna sequencing using the next generation sequencing technologies, the once daunting and prohibitive task of sequencing the autopolyploid sugarcane genome becomes a real possibility.

sorghum  moench) is a major cereal crop that provides food, feed, fiber, and fuel. it is domesticated in northern africa with the ability to be productive in adverse environment and is valued for its drought tolerance. in comparison to polyploid sugarcane, sorghum is a diploid with  <dig> chromosomes and has a genome of about  <dig> mb  <cit> . the size of the monoploid sugarcane genome is estimated to be of similar magnitude, approximately  <dig> mb; the genome complexity in sugarcane comes from the ploidy level and the two genome sets presented in sugarcane hybrids. the sorghum genome has been sequenced because of its small genome size and its importance for food security and biofuel production in diverse environments, particularly developing countries in the tropics  <cit> . sorghum and sugarcane belong to the same subtribe, saccharinae, within the grass family poaceae  <cit>  and are close relatives to each other, sharing a common ancestor about 8- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the completion of the sorghum genome sequence offered unprecedented opportunities for sugarcane genomic research  <cit> .

the synteny between sugarcane and sorghum genome has been reported before using dna markers  <cit> , but no details of microsynteny are available except one pair of sugarcane bacterial artificial chromosomes  containing the adh <dig> gene  <cit> . the objectives of this project are:  to test the suitability of using the sorghum genome as a template to assist assembly of sugarcane sequences generated from  <dig> selected sugarcane bacs using  <dig> flex;  to explore the sequence features of the autopolyploid by examining a large set of long contiguous genomic sequences; and  to test the hypothesis of microcollinearity between sorghum and sugarcane at  <dig> chromosomal locations across the respective genomes.

RESULTS
selection and sequencing of  <dig> sugarcane bacs
to examine the microsynteny between the sugarcane and sorghum genomes,  <dig> sugarcane bacs of the hybrid cultivar r <dig> were selected based on overgo hybridization data performed on the sorghum and sugarcane bac libraries and locations of the overgo probes in the sorghum sequences  <cit> . specifically,  <dig> overgo sequences were blasted against the sorghum genome assembly , and  <dig> have exactly one hit to the sorghum assembly with at least  <dig> to  <dig> bp identical to the sorghum genome target. the blast hit locations were converted to the locations in base pair on the ordered sorghum scaffolds and then to the positions of assembled chromosomes. the  <dig> "single copy sorghum overgoes" were compared to the sugarcane hybridization data and  <dig> overgoes had  <dig> to  <dig> hits on sugarcane as  <dig> to  <dig> homologs per basic chromosome were expected in the hybrid cultivar r <dig>  we then found a subset of bacs hit by at least two of the above probes that were within about  <dig> kb in sorghum and  <dig> sugarcane bacs were then selected with one sugarcane bac corresponding to each sorghum chromosome arm in the euchromatic regions of the  <dig> sorghum chromosomes .

these  <dig> bacs were sequenced by one  <dig> flex run using a bac pooling strategy with four horizontal and five vertical pools . a total of  <dig>  reads were generated, yielding  <dig> mb raw sequences after excluding low quality sequences. the insert sizes of the  <dig> sugarcane bacs with insert were estimated using pulse field gel electrophoresis, ranging from  <dig> -  <dig> kb with an average of  <dig>  kb . the bac clone 19d <dig> turned out to be empty as confirmed by the end sequences of this clone matching 100% to the pbelobac <dig> vector sequence. this clone had been manually selected because the two hybridized overgoes hit same location on sorghum genome, which weaken the anchor evidence of this clone. we then excluded it from further analysis. the total reads for remaining  <dig> bacs provided 64× coverage for the combined  <dig>  mb bac sequences.

b: all  <dig> contigs were blast against each other, and those contigs with matching sequences to other contigs were removed from comparative analysis with sorghum genome

initial assembly of bac sequences based on the row and column pools resulted in a total of  <dig> contigs, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> contigs per bac with a combined length of  <dig>  mb . these assembled contigs were examined to eliminate redundant small assemblies, and  <dig> unambiguous contigs with a total of  <dig>  mb sequences were sorted out to represent the sequence of  <dig> bacs with an estimated sum of  <dig>  mb . to order the multiple contigs for each bac, orthologous sorghum sequences were used as templates to orient these sugarcane contigs and fill the gaps between the contigs when possible. a sum of  <dig>  mb sugarcane contigs were unambiguously ordered, accounting for  <dig> % of the  <dig>  mb bac sequences . contigs of two bacs, sc0172l <dig> and sc0175o <dig>  were not ordered because all the contigs were less than  <dig> kb with a few genes predicted but projected to different sorghum super contigs. among the  <dig>  mb ordered sugarcane contig sequences, the sequence aligned with sorghum sequence spanned  <dig>  mb , accounting for about  <dig> % of the sugarcane bac sequences.

gene content and repetitive sequences
to annotate the sequenced sugarcane bacs, the repetitive sequences of the assembled bac contigs were first masked by repeatmasker using a repeat database combined from repbase databases and tigr plant repeat databases. the remaining sequences were annotated using sugarcane ests, sorghum ests, and predicted sorghum gene models. in total,  <dig> protein coding genes were predicted in the  <dig> sugarcane bac sequences, including  <dig>  validated by sugarcane ests,  <dig> by sorghum ests, and additional  <dig> corresponding to sorghum predicted gene models . in the corresponding sorghum regions,  <dig> genes were annotated, including  <dig>  validated by sorghum ests,  <dig> by sugarcane ests, and additional  <dig> by sorghum gene models. a total of  <dig>  genes from the  <dig> bacs are predicted to be true orthologs between sugarcane and sorghum. sequence identity between these two species across  <dig> kb coding region revealed a  <dig> % exon sequence identity with a range of  <dig>  to 100%.

for the genes of sugarcane inferred by sorghum ests and gene models, rt-pcr was used to confirm their expression. among the  <dig> genes matched by sorghum ests, primers were designed from  <dig> of them, and  <dig>  were expressed in mature leaves or leaf rolls . among the  <dig> genes predicted by the sorghum gene models, primers were designed from  <dig> of them, and  <dig>  were expressed in mature leaves or leaf rolls . the expression of two genes appear to be developmental stage specific, sc187j16c6-11k only detected in leaf rolls and sc11815c12-55k in mature leaf. the number of validated genes on the  <dig> bacs is  <dig> , and the average gene density is one gene/ <dig>  kb in these euchromatic regions.

among these annotated genes,  <dig> sugarcane genes have no counterpart on the corresponding sorghum region while  <dig> sorghum genes have no counterpart on the corresponding sugarcane regions. the  <dig> putative sugarcane-specific genes are distributed on  <dig> bacs and are all supported by sugarcane ests. among them,  <dig> have no orthologs in the sorghum genome and  <dig> have orthologs in other parts of the sorghum genome rather than in the corresponding regions. for the  <dig> sorghum genes without sugarcane orthologs, one is supported by sorghum est, and the other  <dig> are predicted by sorghum gene models. the  <dig> sugarcane-specific genes were blasted against the non-redundant protein database in genbank. only five of them presented significant match , two with known function, encoding beta-galactosidase  <dig> and auxin efflux carrier, respectively, and the other three encoding hypothetical proteins. the remaining  <dig> ests have no match in the non-redundant protein database.

we examined the content of repetitive sequences in these euchromatic regions of sugarcane and sorghum. the sorghum genome contains 61% repetitive sequences, but most of them are in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions  <cit> . the percentage of repetitive sequences in the about  <dig> mb regions studied is  <dig> % in sugarcane and  <dig> % in sorghum. both genomes contain similar quantities of retroelements,  <dig> % in sugarcane and  <dig> % in sorghum, mostly ltr-retrotransposons. however, sugarcane has more copia than gypsy elements  while sorghum has more gypsy  elements in these analyzed regions. sorghum displayed more dna transposons than sugarcane  in these regions .

in the approximately  <dig> mb sugarcane sequences, about  <dig> kb were simple repeats. we have designed  <dig> pairs of primer from the sequences flanking the simple sequence repeats  for genetics mapping. thirty six ssrs were amplified successfully and six were polymorphic between s. officinarum la purple and s. robustum molokai  <dig>  the parents of our sugarcane mapping population .

comparative analysis of sugarcane and sorghum homologous sequences
the selected sugarcane bacs corresponding to euchromatic regions of sorghum chromosome arms made it possible to analyze microsynteny between these two closely related genomes. of the  <dig> genes annotated in the sugarcane bacs,  <dig>  matched orthologous sorghum genes, and they provided the anchoring points for aligning sugarcane bac contigs to sorghum chromosomes. the sequence of bac sc79a <dig> was actually aligned with sorghum chromosome  <dig> instead of chromosome  <dig> as defined by previous overgo probes , which is due to the reassignment of few scaffolds in the final chromosome assembly. all other bacs aligned correctly to the sorghum chromosome arms as assigned by the locations of overgo probes. most of the aligned regions are collinear between sugarcane and sorghum, while numerous small scale chromosomal rearrangements were uncovered, including all known types of chromosomal rearrangements . deletions and insertions are too numerous to be counted. duplications appeared to have occurred more frequently in sugarcane  than in sorghum . three inversions were detected, but we lacked an outgroup to enable inference about which genome they had occurred in. translocations occurred more frequently than inversions, with seven translocations and four inverted translocations found.

alignment of sorghum and sugarcane genomic sequences revealed local dna sequence expansion in both genomes . but over all, the sorghum genome expanded more in the aligned regions. among the sequenced sugarcane bacs, a total region of  <dig> kb aligned to  <dig>  kb sorghum sequence, suggesting a net  <dig> kb  expansion in sorghum, likely due to the accumulation of retrotransposons. to determine the possible cause of sequence expansion, we examined two of the aligned regions where the sorghum sequence expanded  <dig> %  and sugarcane sequence expanded 47% . the genic regions between the two species were highly conserved by presenting a set of orthologous genes with the same size, orientation, structure, and function. however, the intergenic regions were extensively dissimilar with abundant transposable elements, including three distinct retrotransposon, dna transposons, simple repeats, and centromeric repeats , which accounted for the expansion in both sorghum and sugarcane sequences.

tandem gene duplication was observed in both sugarcane and sorghum genomes. these genes were identified by aligning genome sequence with sugarcane and sorghum ests. for example, a gene duplication was found on sorghum chromosome  <dig> but not in the corresponding region of sugarcane bac 118l <dig> contig  <dig>  three tandem copies of the gene predicted to encode the 60s ribosomal l10a protein is found in sorghum and only one copy in sugarcane. another gene encoding serine carboxypeptidase  <dig> was duplicated in sugarcane bac 109d <dig> contig 11-13- <dig> but not in the corresponding region of sorghum chromosome  <dig>  there were two copies of this gene in sugarcane and one in sorghum  <cit> . in another case, a gene encoding for receptor kinase was duplicated in sugarcane bac 108j <dig> but not in the corresponding region of sorghum chromosome  <dig> .

the large number of orthologous genes between sugarcane and sorghum allowed us to estimate the divergence time between these two closely related genera to be about  <dig>  million years using  <dig> pairs of orthologous genes .

validation of  <dig> sequence assembly using sanger sequences
to assess the quality of  <dig> flex sequence assembly, we selected two bacs sc172l <dig> and sc118l <dig> for sanger sequencing. sc118l <dig> appeared to harbor a substantial amount of rearrangement between sugarcane and sorghum and sc172l <dig> had  <dig> relatively short contigs assembled from  <dig> reads with the longest contig of  <dig> kb and a few genes being annotated that scattered in different regions of the sorghum genome. the sanger sequence reads of these two bacs, were assembled into  <dig> and  <dig> contigs, respectively, after multiple attempts to close the remaining gaps by primer walking, each showing a reduction from the  <dig> and  <dig> contigs of  <dig> sequences. the sanger sequences of these two bacs also matched the estimated insert size of  <dig> kb for sc172l <dig> and  <dig> kb for sc118l <dig>  while the assembled  <dig> contigs are  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb for these two bacs respectively .

alignment between the sanger and  <dig> sequences revealed missing sequences in each of the assemblies. segments of sc172l <dig> are not in the  <dig> contigs, whereas all assembled sanger sequences of sc118l <dig> are in  <dig> contigs that also have additional sequences not present in the sanger sequences . plots of the sanger and  <dig> sequences against the sorghum sequences also showed that the  <dig> sequence of sc118l <dig> is more complete than the sanger sequence of this bac, possibly because of the sequences in the five gaps that we were not able to close . the sanger sequence of sc172l <dig> is more complete than the  <dig> contigs, which covered only  <dig>  kb of the  <dig> kb insert , and allowed us to identify and annotate an extra gene and a few more retrotransposase genes validated by the sugarcane ests. these two sugarcane bacs contains  <dig> % repetitive sequences, higher than the  <dig> % in the sorghum homologous regions .

the previous  <dig> sequence of sc172l <dig> had  <dig> short contigs  and six genes including four retrotransposase genes. its alignment to sorghum sequence was puzzling because the six genes aligned to different regions of the sorghum genome. the more complete sanger sequences of sc172l <dig> allowed us to align it with the sorghum genome, which revealed chromosomal rearrangements after the divergence of these two species. the bac sc172l <dig> aligned largely to sorghum chromosome  <dig>  but a portion aligned to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . though the sanger sequence of sc118l <dig> was less complete than its  <dig> sequence, the assembly from sanger reads further confirmed the local chromosome rearrangements harbored by this bac .

discussion
because of the large number of chromosomes  and the nature of autopolyploids, both high density genetic mapping and physical mapping have proven to be challenging tasks in sugarcane. currently, there is no physical map and no saturated genetic map that covers all chromosomes. alternative approaches would need to be tested for a potential sugarcane genome sequencing project. our results showed that the sorghum genome is an excellent template for assembly of sugarcane euchromatic sequences. the initial assembly of pooled  <dig> bac sequences showed 40% inflation compared with estimated insert sizes, which likely was caused by multiple assemblies of repetitive sequences. after aligning the sequences with the sorghum genome using orthologous genes as anchors,  <dig> % of the sugarcane bac contigs could be ordered unambiguously and  <dig> % of the sugarcane bac sequences aligned with the sorghum genic regions. sequences that were not aligned consisted of repetitive and non-coding sequences.

the suitability of the sorghum genome as a template for sugarcane genomic sequence assembly, at least for the genic regions, will be critical for strategic planning to sequence the sugarcane genome. current bac by bac or whole genome shotgun sequencing approach would require a high density genetic map ideally with a density at two markers per mb and a physical map with a10× genome coverage. for sugarcane, the only bac library available is constructed from commercial hybrid cultivar r <dig> with  <dig> × genome coverage  <cit> . a 10× coverage bac library would require one million clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb, an expensive and laborious task. a high density genetic map would require mapping  <dig>  markers for the  <dig> chromosomes of r <dig>  and these markers would have to be sequence tagged to be useful for sequence assembly, not anonymous markers such as amplified fragment length polymorphism  markers. in the past  <dig> years,  <dig> sugarcane maps have been constructed, and each of them covers only a fraction of the genome with less than  <dig>  markers, and the majority of the markers in recent maps are aflp markers  <cit> . fortunately, the cost of sequencing is declining rapidly with increased throughput. most likely, a draft of the sugarcane genome will be generated before an ultra high density  genetic map and a physical map are available, using the sorghum genome as a template for sequence assembly.

the sugarcane genome has gone through at least two rounds of genome wide duplication events to become an octoploid since its divergence from a common ancestor shared with sorghum. the two rounds of duplications might have occurred after the speciation event separated the two wild species s. robustum  and s. spontaneum  since these two species has different basic chromosome number  <cit> , within  <dig> million years  <cit> . although each octoploid has eight genomes, it is not possible to distinguish each individual genome and every genome is a mosaic of all eight genome segments, because every chromosome is free to pair and recombine with any one of the other seven homologous chromosomes during meiosis, although it should be noted that most genetic maps of sugarcane showed some evidence of preferential pairing  <cit> . for this reason, it might not be possible to distinguish the two recent genome wide duplications, and a minimum tiling path of bac clones would be as a good representative as any one single genome in the octoploid. the hybrid cultivar r <dig> has 2n =  <dig> chromosomes with potentially  <dig> genomes. we selected a single bac from each of  <dig> euchromatic regions corresponding to  <dig> distinctive chromosome arms , representing one of the potential  <dig> genome. we found more genes in sugarcane sequenced fragments than in sorghum in the aligned homologous regions , and more putative sugarcane specific genes  than sorghum specific genes . two of the  <dig> initially annotated sugarcane specific genes have orthologs in other part of the sorghum genome, which left  <dig> to be most likely sugarcane specific genes. all  <dig> putative sugarcane-specific genes were validated by sugarcane ests, while only one of the  <dig> putative sorghum-specific genes was validated by sorghum ests. moreover,  <dig> of the  <dig> sugarcane specific genes have no match in the non-redundant protein database in genbank, suggesting that they are likely involved in sugarcane-specific processes. although we masked the repetitive sequences of the bacs using plant repeat database, it is possible that some of them could be low copy transposable elements since we don't have a sugarcane specific repeat database.

the sugarcane est project  yielded a database containing  <dig>  ests assembled into  <dig>  unigenes from  <dig> different cdna libraries  <cit> . this est database validated  <dig> % of the  <dig> annotated genes on the  <dig> sugarcane bacs, while only  <dig> % of the  <dig> sorghum annotated genes were validated by sorghum ests. it might be a general rule that the est databases of polyploid organisms represent higher percentage of genes than their diploid counterparts, because the multiple  allelic forms of each gene would result in greater chance of a particular allelic form to be sequenced in a collection of a wide range of tissues and developmental stages. however, more alleles don't necessarily increase the chance of a particular gene to be expressed in any type of tissues or developmental stages, as we have discovered two developmental stage specific genes in our rt pcr experiment involving  <dig> predicted genes.

the subtribe saccharinae includes three major biofuel crops, sugarcane, miscanthus, and sorghum. sugarcane and miscanthus are closely related and belong to the saccharum complex  <cit> . sorghum is their closest relative outside of the saccharum complex. our estimate of a common ancestor shared by sugarcane and sorghum about  <dig>  million years ago is in line with the 8- <dig> million years estimated by jannoo et al  <cit> . this time frame should be also applied to miscanthus as it is a member of the saccharum complex.

most of the bac sequences aligned with the sorghum sequences collinearly. however, one of the bac  aligned to multiple chromosomes of sorghum, indicating large scale chromosomal rearrangements between sugarcane and sorghum genomes. numerous local small scale  rearrangements between sugarcane and sorghum genomes were also detected. these sequence arrangements at both intra- and inter-chromosomal scales between the two species reflect their evolutionary history after their divergence about  <dig> million years ago. our sugarcane bac sequences provide the view of a representative genome of the possible  <dig> genomes in r <dig>  it would be more interesting to document the rearrangements among sugarcane homologs, which should be far fewer.

the 2c genome size of r <dig> is about  <dig> gb with an average of  <dig> mb per chromosome among its  <dig> chromosomes, larger than the ~ <dig> mb per chromosome in sorghum  <cit> . however, our data suggest that the sorghum sequences appear to be expanded compare to the sugarcane orthologous sequences studied, due to accumulation of retroelements, contradicting the genome size estimates from flow cytometry. if what we observed truly reflect the features of these two genomes, the basic genome of sugarcane  could be smaller than that of sorghum. the discrepancy between the direct sequence comparison and the genome size estimates could be due to tendency of overestimating genome size by flow cytometry, as demonstrated by the sequenced genomes of rice and poplar  <cit> . it is also possible that the discrepancy is caused by inaccurate assembly of repetitive sequences of the sugarcane bacs generated by  <dig> flex. finally, the small sampling of sugarcane bacs that we studied may not be representative of the genome as a whole.

sugarcane has been cultivated and improved over thousands of years, beginning in prehistoric times with selection initially on natural variations and continuing with the modern techniques of hybridization and genetic engineering. enormous yield increase has been achieved in the last century by breeding for yield, disease and insect resistance, and stress tolerance. while sugarcane farmers throughout the world face constant challenges to sustain profitability and protect the environment  <cit> , breeders face not only those challenges but also a biological constraint as the gap between average farm yield and genetic yield potential is narrowed through improved agronomic practices  <cit> . sequencing the complex genome of autopolyploid sugarcane will provide the genomic resources to study genes and gene interactions controlling sugar yield, biomass yield, and other agronomic traits. a sugarcane genome sequence has the potential to revolutionize sugarcane improvement programs by providing high throughput genome wide screening for genomic selection  <cit> , and for mining promoters of specific alleles.

CONCLUSIONS
sugarcane is an economically important tropic crop primarily for sugar production but increasingly for biofeul production. its large polyploid genome coupled with interspecific hybridization and aneuploid hindered sugarcane genomic research. the available genome sequence of sorghum, a closely relative of sugarcane, provides an exceptional opportunity to unravel the complex sugarcane genome. in this study, we strategically selected  <dig> sugarcane bacs each corresponding to a sorghum chromosome arm for sequencing to study the genome structure and organization. sequence comparisons revealed that sugarcane genome is mostly collinear in the genic regions with sorghum genome, and the coding region of sugarcane and sorghum shared an average of  <dig> % sequence identity. the unaligned regions between sugarcane and sorghum sequences were occupied mostly by repeats. the sorghum genome is an excellent template for assembling the genic dna of the autopolyploid sugarcane genome. the comparable gene density between sugarcane and sorghum and the high number of sugarcane specific genes indicated that sugarcane genome might have retained more, not less, genes after the divergence of these two genera. polyploidy species might not have faster pace of gene loss despite the redundancy of multiple alleles at each locus.
