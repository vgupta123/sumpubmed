BACKGROUND
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  are pathogenic bacteria that are able to infect humans and several species of animals. in farm animals such as cattle, etec infection results in reduced growth rate, increased mortality and economic loss  <cit> . etec interacts with intestinal epithelial cells , colonizes the small intestine and secretes enterotoxins inducing intestinal acute diarrhea and inflammation  <cit> . in addition to its capacity to infect cells and induce damage through toxins, etec are able to induce an inflammatory response through other pathogen-associated molecular patterns  such as lipopolysaccharide  that contribute to cellular and tissue damage during infections  <cit> . etec is able to trigger toll-like receptor - <dig> activation and cytokines production by iecs and induce the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. although this mechanism represent an important primary line of host defense, a prolonged or non-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines production may lead to tissue damage and epithelial barrier disfunction  <cit> . therefore, during etec infection it is imperative to generate an adequate inflammatory response against the pathogen, accompanied by efficient regulation, in order to achieve protection without damaging host tissues.

probiotics have been defined as “live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host”  <cit> . several lactic acid bacteria  strains are considered beneficial to the host and as such have been used as probiotics and included in several functional foods. modulation of host immunity is one of the most commonly alleged benefits of the consumption of probiotics. the term immunobiotics has been proposed for those probiotic strains with immunoregulatory activities  <cit> . studies have shown that immunobiotics can beneficially modulate the immune response against etec  <cit> . roselli et al. <cit>  showed that bifidobacterium animalis mb <dig> and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg protect intestinal caco- <dig> cells from the inflammation-associated response caused by etec k <dig> by partly reducing pathogen adhesion and by counteracting neutrophil migration. moreover, experiments in caco- <dig> cells demonstrated that l. rhamnosus gg is able to counteract the etec-induced up-regulation of interleukin -1β and tumor necrosis factor , and the down-regulation of transforming growth factor β <dig>  expression, and consequently to block the cytokine deregulation  <cit> . in addition, comparative studies between l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis mb <dig>  demonstrated that individual strains of probiotics have a different impact on the inflammatory response triggered in iecs  <cit> . others studies evaluating the effect of probiotic yeasts showed that saccharomyces cerevisiae cncm i- <dig> decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> in porcine intestinal epithelial ipi-2i cells cultured with f4+ etec  <cit> . moreover, it was demonstrated that the cncm i- <dig> strain inhibits etec-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines transcripts and proteins and that this inhibition was associated to a decrease of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinases  phosphorylation and to an increase of the anti-inflammatory peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γmrna level  <cit> .

there is increasing research in the use of probiotics for decreasing pathogen load and ameliorating gastrointestinal disease symptoms in animals  <cit> . several studies were conducted in vivo utilizing different probiotic strains to evaluate the effect of immunobiotics against etec infection, however the majority of these studies were performed in swine and only few in the cattle  <cit> . beside the in vivo studies, several in vitro tests can be performed to identify the best potential probiotics. in this sense, we have recently demonstrated that the combination of the nuclear factor κ b -reporter assay using a porcine tlr2-expressing transfectant , the mitogenic assay using porcine peyer’s patches immunocompetent cells and the evaluation of anti-inflammatory activities of lab in porcine intestinal epithelial  cell line are useful tools to select potential probiotic strains  <cit> . moreover, we showed that pie cells can be used to study the mechanisms involved in the protective activity of immunobiotics against intestinal inflammatory damage and may provide useful information for the development of new immunologically functional feeds that help to prevent inflammatory intestinal disorders, including weaning-associated intestinal inflammation in pigs  <cit> . therefore the use of probiotics in animal feeding could be enhanced by preliminarly in vitro screening such as the production of inhibitory substances, survival in the gastrointestinal tract and antibiotic susceptibility  <cit>  that can be analyzed to evaluate functionality and safety  <cit> . moreover, the use of probiotics in cattle could be improved by the development of in vitro systems specific for cattle that allow the simply and efficient assess of the immunomodulatory activity of the potential probiotic lab strains.

recently we have successfully established a bovine intestinal epithelial cell line   <cit> . we hypothesized that bie cells are useful in vitro model system for the study of interactions between pathogens and bovine iecs, for the selection of immunobiotic microorganisms and for the study of the mechanisms of immunomodulation by probiotic lab in iecs. therefore, the aims of the present study were: i) to assess the capability of bie cells to respond to the challenge with heat-stable etec pamps, considering the production of cytokines and the activation of mapk and nf-κb pathways and; i) to select potential immunomodulatory lab that may be used to beneficially modulate the inflammatory response in bovine iecs challenged with heat-stable etec pamps.

bie cells were stimulated with l. casei oll <dig> or mep <dig>  for  <dig> hr and then challenged with heat-stable etec pamps as described before. the concentration of il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> secreted into the supernatant of bie cell cultures was determined using two commercially available enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay  kits , according to the manufacturers’ instructions.

western blotting
bie cells cultured in  <dig> × <dig> cells/ <dig> mm dishes were stimulated with lactobacillus casei oll <dig> or pam3csk <dig> with same time schedule and equivalent amount as mentioned above. bie cells were then washed and stimulated with heat-stable etec pamps for indicated time. after stimulation, bie cells were washed three times with pbs and resuspended in  <dig> μl of cellytic m cell lysis reagent  including protease and phosphates inhibitors . protein concentration was measured with bca protein assay kit . extracts  were transferred into eppendorf tubes and were added with  <dig> μl of sample buffer solution , and boiled for  <dig> min at 95°c. equal amounts of extracted proteins  were loaded on 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a pvdf membrane. the membrane was blocked with 2% bsa/tbs-t  for  <dig> hours at room temperature. phosphorylation of p <dig>  jnk and erk mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor kappa b inhibitor protein  degradation were evaluated using phospho-p <dig> mapk  antibody ; p <dig> mapk antibody ; phospho-sapk/jnk  antibody ; sapk/jnk antibody ; phospho-p44/ <dig> map kinase  antibody ; p44/ <dig> map  antibody  and; i kappab-alpha antibody  from cell signaling technology  at  <dig> times dilution of their original antibodies and with immunoreaction enhancer  overnight at room temperature. after washing with tbs-t, the membrane was incubated alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-rabbit igg  at  <dig> times dilution with immunoreaction enhancer  for  <dig> hour at room temperature. after washing with tbs-t, signals were generated by overlaying the membrane with ecftm substrate  for  <dig> min at room temperature under dark conditions. the attophos  was detected by molecular imager fx . the densitometry of western blots was carried out by using image j software .

statistical analysis
normalized relative expression of each control data  was transferred to a normal distribution with a mean of  <dig> . in order to normalize the control data, they were fitted by using the following function: zxi=xi−xcontrol−σx/σx 

z: all adjusted data; xi: ith experimental data, x: a mean of repeated control data; and σx was a standard deviation of repeated control or trial data. similarly, normalized relative expression for heat-stable etec pamps and lactobacilli data was fitted to this function to show them as a fold value compared to the control data. each of data number repeated in a same condition was from  <dig> to  <dig>  statistical analysis was performed by using sas computer program, ver. <dig>  and glm procedure. the multiple comparisons among means of fold expression were carried out by fisher’s least significance differential test, lsd method. differences were significant at 5% level and were showed in graphs with superscripts letters  or asterisks .

RESULTS
expression of tlrs in bie cells
in order to study the mechanisms by which bovine iecs induce immune responses against intestinal pathogens, we have previously established a clonal bovine intestinal epithelial cell line . when bie cells are cultured they assume monolayer cobblestone and epithelial-like morphology with close contact between the cells  <cit> . moreover, scanning electron microscopy examination of bie cell reveled that 3-days old cells have irregular and slender microvilli-like structures on their surface and that this structures increase in complexity as the cells grow  <cit> . in this work, we applied real-time quantitaive pcr to analyze the expression of tlrs mrna in bie cells. all tlrs genes were expressed in bie cells . among tlr family, tlr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were strongly expressed, followed by tlr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we were particularly interested in expression of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> as the main receptors detecting lab and etec respectively. therefore, to confirm these real-time pcr findings, we further examined the expression of tlr <dig> and  <dig> proteins in bie cells using anti-tlrs antibodies that are able to cross-react with bovine tlrs . visualization of the immunofluorescense staining confirmed the protein expression of tlr <dig> and  <dig> in bie cells .

study of the inflammatory response in bie cells stimulated with heat-stable etec pamps
we next investigated the response of bie cells to heat-stable etec pamps challenge. the etec 987p strain used in this study does not express flagellin and we have demonstrated that the main molecule responsible for the inflammatory response triggered by this bacterium is the lps present on its surface  <cit> . bie cells were cultured for  <dig> days and then challenged with heat-stable etec pamps. twelve hours after stimulation we determined mrna levels of several cytokines . stimulation of bie cells with heat-stable etec pamps significantly increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines mcp- <dig>  il-1α, il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> and the levels of ifn-β . we also evaluated the mrna levels of il-1α, il-1β, il-6il- <dig>  tnf and mcp- <dig> at different times after stimulation with heat-stable etec pamps, with the aim of establishing the most appropriate time to study the inflammatory response. after the challenge with heat-stable etec pamps, levels of il-1α, il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and mcp- <dig> increased progressively in bie cells until the hour  <dig> post-stimulation . on the contrary, mrna levels of tnf in bie cells stimulated with heat-stable etec pamps were increased earlier at hour  <dig> . considering these results, we selected the hour  <dig> post-stimulation for the following experiments.

selection of lactobacilli strains able to modulate inflammatory response in bie cells
recently, we have demonstrated that stimulation with lactobacillus jensenii tl <dig> is able to down-regulate the levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> produced by porcine iecs in response to heat-stable etec pamps or lps challenges  <cit> . moreover, we demonstrated that tlr <dig> is partially involved in this immunoregulatory effect of l. jensenii tl <dig> in pie cells  <cit> . then, we next aimed to evaluate if this immunobiotic strain has a similar effect on bie cells. for this reason, bie cells were stimulated for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours with l. jensenii tl <dig> or the synthetic tlr <dig> agonist pam3csk <dig> and then challenged with heat-stable etec pamps. twelve hours after stimulation levels of mcp- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> were evaluated . stimulation of bie cells for  <dig> h with l. jensenii tl <dig> or pam3csk <dig> significantly increased the production of il- <dig> in response to heat-stable etec pamps challenge in hour  <dig> post-stimulation. on the contrary, levels of il- <dig> were significantly lower in cells treated for  <dig> h with l. jensenii tl <dig> or pam3csk <dig>  mcp- <dig> levels were significantly higher than controls in bie cells treated for  <dig> h with pam3csk <dig> or  <dig> h with l. jensenii tl <dig> . bie cells pre-stimulated with l. jensenii tl <dig> or pam3csk <dig> during  <dig> h showed significantly reduced levels of il- <dig> .

these results indicate that it is possible to modulate the inflammatory response in bie cells by using lab. then, we next aimed to evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory effect of  <dig> lactobacilli strains in bie cells with the aim of finding the strain with the highest immunomodulatory capacity in the bovine system. first, we evaluated the effect of lactobacilli on bie cells without any inflammatory challenge . bie cells were treated with the different lactobacilli strains for  <dig> h and the levels of mrna il- <dig>  il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> were determined. only the strain mep <dig> slightly increased levels of mcp- <dig>  and mep <dig> and mep <dig> also slightly increased levels of il- <dig> in bie cells . on the contrary, several strains were able to significantly down-regulate the levels of il- <dig> in bie cells . next, we evaluated the effect of lactobacilli on bie cells using heat-stable etec pamps as inflammatory factor . for this purpose, bie cells were stimulated with the different lab strains for  <dig> h, challenged with heat-stable etec pamps and the levels of the three pro-inflammatory cytokines were studied at hour  <dig> post-stimulation. mcp- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> levels in bie cells stimulated with oll <dig>  mep <dig>  mep <dig> and mep <dig> strains were significantly lower than those observed in the control. on the contrary, the other strains tested reduced one of the cytokines studied or had no effect . considering that l. casei oll <dig> and l. casei mep <dig> showed the highest capacity to down-regulate il- <dig> and also were able to reduce il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> after heat-stable etec pamps challenge, one of these strains  was selected for the following experiments. to further confirm the immunoregulatory effect of l. casei oll <dig> and to obtain transcriptional data supported by protein detection of selected cytokines, we conducted elisas to evaluate the levels of il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> proteins . bie cells were stimulated with l. casei oll <dig> or l. casei mep <dig>  and  <dig> h after were challenged with heat-stable etec pamps. challenge significantly increased levels of both il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> proteins. pretreatment of bie cells with l. casei oll <dig> significantly reduced levels of mcp- <dig>  however l. casei mep <dig> was not able to modify mcp- <dig> values . both l. casei oll <dig> and mep <dig> were able to reduce levels of il- <dig> after the challenge with heat-stable etec pamps, however the effect of l. casei oll <dig> was significantly higher than those observed for mep <dig>  in addition, we evaluated if the tlr <dig> agonist pam3csk <dig> was able to modulate il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> synthesis. bie cells pretreated pam3csk <dig> showed reduced levels of both cytokines after heat-stable etec pamps challenge .

effect of l. casei oll <dig> on mapk and nf-κb pathways in bie cells
we next evaluated whether l. casei oll <dig> was able to attenuate heat-stable etec pamps-mediated pro-inflammatory responses by modulating the nf-κb pathway. challenge of bie cells with heat-stable etec pamps significantly reduced the levels of the counter-regulatory factor iκbα . bie cells previously stimulated with l. casei oll <dig> or pam3csk <dig> did not show a significant degradation of iκbα indicating an inhibitory effect in nf-κb pathway . we also examined the relationship between mapk activation and regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bie cells by l. casei oll <dig> . bie cells were stimulated with oll <dig> strain, pam3csk <dig> or control medium and the activation profiles of p <dig>  erk and jnk were compared. as shown in figure 5a and b, heat-stable etec pamps induced the phosphorylation of p <dig> and erk, which reached a maximum between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes. the time course of erk phosphorylation induced by heat-stable etec pamps in bie cells treated with pam3csk <dig> showed a similar tendency to that observed in the control. on the contrary, reduced phosphorylation of p <dig> was observed in pam3csk4- and l. casei oll2768-treated bie cells . in addition, in l. casei oll2768- treated bie cells a delayed increase of p-erk was observed when compared to control. in l. casei oll2768-treated cells the levels of p-erk were significantly increased  <dig> min after heat-stable etec pamps challenge . the time course of jnk phosphorylation induced by heat-stable etec pamps in bie cells treated with pam3csk <dig> showed a similar tendency to that observed in the control . in l. casei oll2768- treated bie cells, phosphorylation of jnk significantly increased at minutes  <dig> and  <dig> after heat-stable etec pamps challenge. in addition, the levels of p-jnk decreased at minutes  <dig> and  <dig> in l. casei oll2768-treated bie cells, showing a difference with the control cells .

effect of l. casei oll <dig> on negative regulators of the tlrs signaling pathway in bie cells
we studied the negative regulators that are known to mediate the tlr signaling pathway. first, we aimed to evaluate the changes in tlrs negative regulators without any pro-inflammatory challenge. for this reason, bie cells were stimulated for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours with l. casei oll <dig> or pam3csk <dig> and the expression of single immunoglobulin il-1-related receptor , toll interacting protein , a20-binding inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa b activation  <dig> , b-cell lymphoma 3-encoded protein , mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  and interleukin- <dig> receptor-associated kinase m  was determined by real-time pcr. none of the treatments were able to significantly induce changes in the expression of sigirr, abin- <dig> or irak-m . we observed a slightly increase of mkp- <dig> after  <dig> hours of stimulation with both l. casei oll <dig> or pam3csk <dig>  however this increase was not maintained after  <dig> hours. in addition, both treatments were capable of up-regulate the expression of tollip after  <dig> h post-stimulation . the expression of bcl- <dig> was significantly up-regulated after  <dig> h post-stimulation with pam3csk <dig> or  <dig> h with pam3csk <dig> and l. casei oll <dig> . we next evaluated the changes in the expression of tlr negative regulators after the challenge with heat-stable etec pamps. again, bie cells were treated with l. casei oll <dig> or pam3csk <dig> for  <dig> hours and stimulated with heat-stable etec pamps. no changes were observed in the expression of irak-m and abin- <dig> with either treatment . mkp- <dig> was significantly up-regulated in oll2768-treated bie cells only in hour  <dig> post-challenge. in addition, the stimulation of bie cells with pam3csk <dig> increased expression levels of sigirr and tollip at hour  <dig> post-stimulation with heat-stable etec pamps. on the other hand, bie cells treated with l. casei oll <dig> showed significantly higher levels of bcl- <dig> and tollip during all the studied period when compared to untreated control bie cells .

discussion
although once considered simply a physical barrier, it is becoming increasingly evident that the epithelium plays as a crucial regulator of intestinal immune homeostasis. in response to invasive bacteria, iecs may produce a variety of cytokines and chemokines that play a crucial role in both the innate and adaptive immune responses in the gut  <cit> . in this paper, in order to understand the functional role of the bovine intestinal epithelium in mucosal host defense as part of the immune system, we studied in bie cells the expression of tlrs and characterized heat-stable etec pamps-induced signal transduction pathways and cytokine induction. it is known that iecs are able to respond to pathogenic microorganisms because their expression of pattern recognition receptors  such as tlrs. therefore, the first aim of our research was to investigate the expression of tlrs in bie cells. we found that tlr <dig> was one of the most highly expressed tlrs in bie cells. tlr <dig> is conserved among different species and its expression appears to be a characteristic feature of iecs  <cit> , therefore, the presence of tlr <dig> in bie cells resembles iecs of other species.

the inflammatory response triggered by the activation of tlr <dig> in iecs play a critical role in host defense against gram pathogens. in this study, we showed that heat-stable etec pamps from strain 987p significantly enhanced the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-1α and mcp- <dig> in bie cells by activating both nf-κb and mapk pathways. these findings correlate with our previous observations since we demonstrated that the heat-killed etec 987p strain, which does not express flagellin, triggers a tlr4-mediated inflammatory response in porcine intestinal epithelial cells through its lps  <cit> . moreover, the findings of the present work correlate with studies of the immune response against etec in iecs of different hosts species. it was shown that both nf-κb and mapk pathways are important mediators of etec and lps activation in human , mouse  and porcine  iecs  <cit> .

the cytokines produced by bie cells may have an important protective role during etec infection. the enhanced secretion of il- <dig> stimulates the strong infiltration of neutrophils in the lamina propria that is observed upon etec infection. following il- <dig> induced recruitment of neutrophils il- <dig> can induce degranulation of these cells, thereby enhancing the inflammatory response  <cit> . on the other hand, iecs are able to produce mcp- <dig> in response to etec challenge. this chemokine has potent monocytes-activating and attracting propierties and plays a major role during intestinal inflammation  <cit> . therefore, our findings indicate that bie cells are useful cell line for studying inflammatory responses via tlr <dig> in vitro. moreover, taking into consideration that inflammatory responses induced by intestinal pathogens can lead to dysregulation of iecs signaling, disruption of membrane barrier integrity, enhancement of pathogen translocation and disease  <cit> , bie cells could be also used to evaluate therapies designed for preventing inflammatory damage caused by heat-stable etec pamps during etec infection.

several reports have demonstrated that immunobiotic lab are able to improve resistance against pathogens and to protect against inflammatory damage caused by the infectious process  <cit> . therefore we next aimed to evaluate if an immunobiotic lactobacillus strain could regulate the inflammatory response induced by heat-stable etec pamps in bie cells. our laboratory has recently found that l. jensenii tl <dig> has a high capacity to down-regulate il- <dig> and il- <dig> production by pie cells in response to heat-stable etec pamps or lps challenges  <cit> . for these reasons, we first focused on l. jensenii tl <dig> to evaluate its anti-inflammatory effect in bie cells. l. jensenii tl <dig> is able to decrease il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  expressions in heat-stable etec pamps-challenged bie cells. however, this effect was lower when compared with the immunomodulatory activity of this strain in porcine iecs  <cit> . in heat-stable etec pamps-challenged porcine iecs previously treated with l. jensenii tl <dig> the expression of il- <dig> and il- <dig> were 35% and 30% lower than control respectively  <cit> . although the effect of l. jensenii tl <dig> in bie cells was lower than the previously described in porcine iecs, the present study indicate that lab strains could be beneficial for attenuating inflammatory damage caused by heat-stable etec pamps in bie cells. thus, we next aimed to select the most effective strains of lactobacilli able to modulate heat-stable etec pamps-mediated inflammatory response in bie cells. several strains were evaluated in our system and we found that some lactobacilli were able to down-regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines. among these strains, l. casei oll <dig> showed the most pronounced effect. of interest, we showed that the immunoregulatory effect of l. casei oll <dig> in bie cells was more pronounced than that observed for l. jensenii tl <dig>  while the effect of oll <dig> strain was lower in porcine iecs  <cit> . then, our findings indicate that is appropriate to evaluate different strains carefully according to the specific host, because the effect of the same lab strain may differ according to the host that consumes it. in this sense, our in vitro bovine system can be of great value to find immunobiotic lab strains suitable on the bovine host.

in bie cells, l. casei oll <dig> attenuated heat-stable etec pamps-induced pro-inflammatory response and we confirmed that these effects were related to the capacity of oll <dig> strain to inhibit nf-κb and p <dig> signaling pathways in heat-stable etec pamps-challenged bie cells. these results are reminiscent of other studies showing that probiotics are able to suppress tnf- or s. typhimurium- induced il- <dig> gene expression and secretion by iecs in a nf-κb-dependent manner  <cit> . moreover, our experiments extended these findings by showing that lab are able to inhibit p <dig> signaling pathway in heat-stable etec pamps-challenged bovine iecs.

the jnk and p <dig> mapk pathways share several upstream regulators, and accordingly there are multiple stimuli that simultaneously activate both pathways. then we expected that l. casei oll <dig> had the same effect on jnk as they had in p <dig> pathway. however, we found an opposite behavior in jnk pathway. while in l. casei oll2768-treated bie cells the phosphorylation of p <dig> was reduced after challenge with heat-stable etec pamps, increased levels of p-jnk were detected. it was shown that these two stress-activated signaling pathways induce opposite effects and there is evidence indicating that the p <dig> mapk pathway can negatively regulate jnk activity in several contexts  <cit> . in fact, the first evidence for this crosstalk was the observation that chemical inhibition of p38α and p38β strongly increased the activation of jnk, which was induced by il- <dig> and sorbitol in epithelial cells and by lps in macrophages  <cit> . moreover, the kinetic analysis of our results showed an up-regulation of p-p <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes after heat-stable etec pamps challenge that was followed by a down-regulation of p-jnk between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes. therefore, we can speculate that l. casei oll <dig> has a direct influence in p <dig> pathway while its effect in jnk is the result of the inhibition of p <dig> phosphorylation. further research is needed to clarify completely the influence of l. casei oll <dig> in mapk pathways in heat-stable etec pamps-challenged bie cells.

regulatory proteins can modulate the duration and intensity of tlrs signals  <cit> . consequently, to dissect the mechanism that underlie the anti-inflammatory effect of l. casei oll <dig>  we evaluated the effect of this strain on the expression of the tlrs negative regulators in bie cells. we observed that l. casei oll <dig> can negatively regulate tlr <dig> signaling in bie cells by up-regulating tollip and bcl- <dig> proteins. bcl- <dig> functions as an inhibitor of nf-κb activity by stabilizing repressive nf-κb homodimers in a dna-bound state and preventing the binding of transcriptionally active dimers. in fact, stabilization of repressive complexes through the induction of bcl- <dig> expression has been proposed to function in the processes of lps tolerance  <cit> . on the other hand, it was demonstrated that overexpression of tollip impairs tlr4-triggered nf-кb and mapk signaling pathways and that inhibition of tlr signaling by tollip is mediated through its ability to suppress the activity of il- <dig> receptor-associated kinase   <cit> . moreover, it was showed that prior exposure of iecs to a tlr ligand, such as lps, induces a hyporesponsive state to a second challenge with the same or another tlr ligand by selectively limiting pro-inflammatory responses through up-regulation of tollip and subsequent suppression of irak  <cit> . therefore, the induction of bcl- <dig> and tollip by l. casei oll <dig> in bie cells is important in establishing nf-κb- and mapk-mediated tolerance against heat-stable etec pamps.

at present, we cannot provide the conclusive mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of l. casei oll <dig> on bie cells. however, we can hypothesize that when l. casei oll <dig> encounters bie cells it interacts with one or more prrs and induces the up-regulation of bcl- <dig> and tollip negative regulators . then, bie cells pretreated with this immunobiotic strain produce lower concentrations of inflammatory mediators in response to heat-stable etec pamps challenge that could help to limit the inflammatory damage. one of the possible prr involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of l. casei oll <dig> could be tlr <dig> since our comparative studies with pam3csk <dig> demonstrated that treatment of bie cells with the tlr <dig> agonist up-regulate the expression of tollip and reduce activation of nf-κb and p <dig> mapk pathways. moreover, it was found that lps cross-tolerance may be induced by pre-exposure to lipoteichoic acid which leads to up-regulation of the common checkpoint tollip via tlr <dig>  <cit> . however, further research is needed to resolve which prr is activated by l. casei oll <dig> for the induction of negative regulators.

CONCLUSIONS
we firstly reported in this study that bie cells are useful for studying in vitro inflammatory responses in the bovine gut epithelium triggered by activation of tlr <dig>  we also demonstrated that bie cells can be used for the selection of immunomodulatory lab and for studying the mechanisms involved in the protective activity of immunobiotics against pathogen-induced inflammatory damage, providing useful information that may be used for the development of new immunologically functional feeds through the screening and precise selection of lactobacilli strains that are able to beneficially modulate the immune system in the bovine host. in addition, we showed that l. casei oll <dig> functionally modulate the bovine intestinal epithelium by attenuating heat-stable etec pamps-induced nf-κb and mapk activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. therefore l. casei oll <dig> is a good candidate for in vivo studying the protective effect of lab against intestinal inflammatory damage induced by etec infection or heat-stable etec pamps challenge in the bovine host.
