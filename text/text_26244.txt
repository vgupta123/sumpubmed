BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an aerobic gram-negative pathogen and a common etiologic agent of nosocomial infections, especially pneumonia, in seriously ill patients  <cit> . this species is intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial agents and usually develop resistance to other antimicrobial agents during antimicrobial chemotherapy, further limiting the available therapeutic options  <cit> .

bacterial efflux systems capable of ejecting antimicrobials are mostly encoded by chromosomal genes and generally fall into five classes, the major facilitator superfamily , the atp-binding cassette  family, the small multi-drug resistance  family, the multi-drug and toxic compound extrusion  family and the resistance-nodulation-division  family  <cit> . the rnd chromosomal systems are encoded by operons and are typically formed by three proteins, which are located in the inner membrane, periplasm and outer membrane of the bacterial cell  <cit> .

sequencing of p. aeruginosa genome revealed the presence of several rnd efflux systems. of those, mexab-oprm, mexcd-oprj, mexef-oprn and mexxy-oprm are able to pump out multiple antipseudomonal compounds  <cit> . studies with mexab-oprm mutants demonstrated that this efflux system extrudes quinolones, aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, novobiocin, and most β-lactams but not imipenem  <cit> . the mexxy-oprm is able to eject cefepime, cefotaxime, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, erythromycin, tetracycline and meropenem  <cit> . mexab-oprm and mexxy-oprm are constitutively expressed and contribute to the intrinsic resistance phenotype of p. aeruginosa. however, when overexpressed, these efflux systems confer reduced susceptibility to different classes of antimicrobial agents  <cit> . although the efflux systems mexcd-oprj and mexef-oprn are quiescent in wild type p. aeruginosa, their overexpression may also contribute to the acquired multi-drug resistance phenotype in mutant isolates  <cit> .

overexpression of efflux systems generally confers modest levels of antimicrobial resistance  <cit> . however, its association with other resistance determinants is frequently observed  <cit> . in brazil, production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases , such as ctx-m  and ges , or metallo-β-lactamases  such as spm  and imp  are the main mechanisms of acquired resistance to broad-spectrum β-lactams among p. aeruginosa clinical isolates  <cit> . the association of these β-lactamases with overexpression of efflux pumps and/or porin loss may lead to high level and/or co-resistance phenotypes  <cit> . for this reason, efflux pumps may seriously impact antimicrobial therapy in clinical settings. the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of efflux systems as well as its association with other resistance mechanisms, such as β-lactamase production and porin down-regulation, among p. aeruginosa clinical isolates.

pulsed field gel electrophoresis
a total of  <dig> distinct pfge patterns were detected among the  <dig> p. aeruginosa clinical isolates studied. five p. aeruginosa isolates could not be typed by pfge using spei. although  <dig> isolates were clustered in six pfge patterns,  <dig> isolates showed distinct pfge patterns.

carbapenems hydrolysis and β-lactamases production
carbapenem hydrolysis was detected in  <dig> p. aeruginosa, representing  <dig> % of the whole collection and  <dig> % of the imipenem-resistant isolates. these isolates had their carbapenemase activity inhibited by edta, and the presence of the mbl-encoding genes blaspm- <dig> and blaimp-like was confirmed by multiplex pcr, in  <dig> and  <dig> isolates, respectively. among the spm-producing p. aeruginosa studied,  <dig> showed the same pfge pattern, whereas one isolate could not be typed using spe i. esbl-encoding genes were present in five isolates: blages- <dig> , blages- <dig>  and blactx-m- <dig> . ges-type producers belonged to the same genotype, whereas ctx-m-2-producer showed a unique pfge profile.

the gene expression analysis showed that  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of p. aeruginosa clinical isolates demonstrated increased mexy  and mexb  transcription mrna levels, respectively, compared to those of pao <dig>  in addition,  <dig> p. aeruginosa isolates  showed overexpression of both mexb and mexy efflux genes. overexpression of mexcd-oprj and mexef-oprn were not observed among the clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa evaluated in this study. overall,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of p. aeruginosa clinical isolates studied showed decreased oprd expression , and overexpression of ampc , respectively. none of the investigated resistance determinants was identified in  <dig> % of clinical isolates .

among the isolates overexpressing the mexy efflux gene,  <dig> % were not susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. cefepime non-susceptibility was observed in 80% of isolates overexpressing mexy. of those,  <dig> % also presented reduced oprd transcription,  <dig> % were mbl-producers,  <dig> % produced the esbl ges- <dig>  and  <dig> % showed increased ampc transcriptional levels . among the cefepime non-susceptible isolates that did not show mexy overexpression,  <dig> % produced spm- <dig>   <dig> % overexpressed ampc,  <dig> % produced the esbl ctx-m- <dig>  and  <dig> % produced ges- <dig>  an esbl with carbapenemase activity.

meropenem non-susceptibility was observed among  <dig> % of isolates overexpressing mexb . of those,  <dig> % showed decreased oprd expression,  <dig> % were mbl producers,  <dig> % overexpressed ampc and  <dig> % were ges- <dig> producers . as expected, all meropenem-susceptible isolates that overexpressed mexb, presented normal expression of both ampc and oprd when compared to that of pao <dig>  higher percentage of mexb overexpression was observed among isolates that were also not susceptible to cefepime, amikacin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. of note,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of spm-producing p. aeruginosa showed increased transcriptional levels of mexy and mexb, respectively.

it is worth to mention that mexab-oprm and/or mexxy-oprm overexpression was observed among isolates that were susceptible to most antimicrobials tested. this finding was expected since efflux pump overexpression in p. aeruginosa usually confers modest increase in the mics of antimicrobial agents that are ejected by these systems.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
p. aeruginosa is the fifth most frequent pathogen of bloodstream infections and the first one causing pneumonia in latin america according to the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program  <cit> . in the last decades, the emergency of multi-drug resistant p. aeruginosa has been observed worldwide. some of antimicrobial agents have become less effective against these organisms reducing the available therapeutic options for treatment of these infections.

in this study  <dig> % of the p. aeruginosa isolates studied were resistant to carbapenems. our findings are in accordance of previous studies that showed high rates of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenems, among p. aeruginosa clinical isolates collected from brazilian institutions  <cit> . the genetic diversity observed among the p. aeruginosa isolates studied indicates that spread of clones and emergency of distinct genotypes have occurred in our hospital. the high rate of carbapenem resistance can be partially explained by the spread of an endemic spm-producing clone. it also justifies the susceptibility rate to aztreonam since mbl producers are not able to hydrolyze this antimicrobial agent. this finding corroborates with those previously reported that described a single spm producer clone spread out in the brazilian territory  <cit> .

the overexpression of efflux systems may impact on clinical outcome of p. aeruginosa infections since they are capable of pumping out many classes of antimicrobial agents used for treatment of these infections  <cit> . however, it has not been clearly established the correlation between increase in the transcriptional level of an efflux-encoding gene and antimicrobial resistance leading to possible therapeutic failure  <cit> .

in the present study, we have evaluated the transcriptional levels of four efflux-encoding genes as well as ampc and oprd among  <dig> p. aeruginosa clinical isolates. this collection represents the total number of patients with bloodstream infection due to p. aeruginosa in a six-month period in hospital são paulo, brazil. we also aimed to evaluate the frequency of isolates presenting different mechanisms of β-lactam resistance and their association.

the overexpression of the mexab-oprm and mexxy-oprm efflux systems were more frequent among antimicrobial resistant p. aeruginosa isolates. since mexab-oprm and mexxy-oprm are constitutively expressed in wild type p. aeruginosa isolates, the antimicrobial policy in use in each individual institution may interfere with the selection of the most overexpressed efflux system. aminoglycosides are important substrates of mexxy-oprm and might have exerted a role in selecting p. aeruginosa that overexpressed this system  <cit> . the expression of mexxy-oprm is inducible, while expression of mexab-oprm is not  <cit> . in our institution, the prescription of aminoglycosides is not controlled and these antimicrobial agents usually are prescribed in combination for treatment of p. aeruginosa infections. these facts could in part justify why mexxy-oprm was the most frequent overexpressed efflux system, since mexxy expression may be induced by these antimicrobial class  <cit> . interestingly, the overexpression of mexxy-oprm was observed in all mbl-producing isolates.

we did not notice a strict correlation between antimicrobial resistance and efflux genes overexpression. however, efflux overexpressing isolates often presented higher antimicrobial mics than did pao <dig> and those isolates in which no antimicrobial resistance determinant was found.

our findings clearly demonstrate that β-lactamase production increase antimicrobial mics more efficiently than do efflux overexpression or porin down-regulation alone. however, these chromosomal resistance mechanisms were frequently present among acquired β-lactamase producers. these findings suggest that efflux overexpression and porin down-regulation may favor the bacterial survival under selective pressure, increasing its chance to acquire further resistance determinants.

in the present study we have observed that efflux pump overexpression do not appear to be the main mechanism of drug resistance among the studied clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, but represents an adjuvant mechanism for antimicrobial resistance. the association of distinct mechanisms such as the porin down-regulation and ampc overproduction play also an important role in the multi-drug resistance phenotype among p. aeruginosa clinical isolates studied. in addition, our findings indicate that spread of clones and emergency of distinct genotypes have occurred in our institution and implementation of control measures is extremely necessary to modify this scenario.
