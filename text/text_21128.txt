BACKGROUND
sugarcane  is a complex polyploid belonging to the family poaceae of the tribe andropogoneae. it is an important commercial sugar producing crop and a source of approximately 50% of the world's sugar and alcohol. the polyploid/aneuploid nature with variation in chromosome number has been largely responsible for its genetic and taxonomic complexity  <cit> . characterization of such large genomes is greatly facilitated by the use of molecular markers. microsatellite or simple sequence repeat  markers are being preferred because of their co-dominant inheritance, reproducibility, multi-allelic nature, chromosome-specific location and wide genomic distribution. these markers are amenable to high throughput genotyping due to multiplexing and efficient resolution of amplicons by automated fragment analysis  <cit> .

in sugarcane, cordeiro et al.   <cit>  and parida et al.   <cit>  developed a large number of microsatellite markers from the genomic sequences. pinto et al.   <cit>  and more recently oliveira et al.   <cit>  also designed such markers from the sugarcane ests, which were used for constructing high resolution functional genetic linkage map of saccharum spp.  <cit> . however, information on a limited number of these genic microsatellite markers is available in the public domain. recently, the est sequences have been assembled into unigenes  <cit> , which is expected to provide non-redundant, locus specific and novel gene-based functional markers for sugarcane having a large genome not amenable to complete sequencing. the unigene sequences of sugarcane have not yet been analyzed for their microsatellite constitution and compared with the other small genome members of the grass family.

in india, systematic breeding of sugarcane has resulted in the development of a number of varieties with high productivity and stress tolerance by inter-specific hybridization  <cit> . however, the genetic base of modern indian sugarcane cultivars is considered narrow due to use of a limited number of parental species clones in cross hybridization and repeated intercrossing of hybrids  <cit> . understanding the extent of natural variation at molecular level is essential to develop new strategies for sugarcane improvement. earlier, molecular markers such as rapd , aflp , and maize and sugarcane genomic microsatellites have been used for this purpose  <cit> . no effort has yet been made to understand the genetic diversity of indian sugarcane cultivars based on functionally relevant genic regions of its complex genome.

the present study was undertaken to mine the available unigene sequences of sugarcane  to understand the microsatellite structure and distribution in the expressed genic component of the genome, assess their functional significance in silico, design primers from the flanking regions of the identified microsatellites, assess the efficiency of a set of fluorescent dye labeled primers in genotyping using automated fragment analysis system and determine functional diversity among different species, related genera and indian varieties of sugarcane.

RESULTS
frequency, distribution and organization of microsatellites in sugarcane unigenes
the type, frequency and relative distribution of the microsatellites in the unigene sequences of sugarcane are given in table  <dig>  the perfect microsatellite  frequency in the unigenes of sugarcane was one in every  <dig>  kb and the proportion of microsatellite carrying unigenes was  <dig> % . when  <dig>   mononucleotide microsatellites were included, the proportion of unigenes carrying microsatellites increased to  <dig> %. the mononucleotides in sugarcane showed a strong bias  towards a/t repeat, with the majority  being  <dig> to  <dig> bases long and the remaining  extending up to  <dig> bases . a total of  <dig> perfect microsatellites were identified in  <dig> unigene sequences of sugarcane. one hundred sixty-seven  of these unigenes contained multiple microsatellites  which were interrupted by more than  <dig> nucleotides and the remaining  <dig>  unigenes had a single microsatellite each. in addition to the perfect microsatellites, we identified  <dig> compound microsatellites, of which  <dig> % were interrupting types and the rest being non-interrupting types . the trinucleotide repeat motifs were the most prevalent  class of microsatellites followed by dinucleotide , tetranucleotide , pentanucleotide  and hexanucleotide  repeat motifs . the gc rich repeat motifs gca/gcc/gcg/gct  coding for alanine were most abundant followed by arginine  and glycine  . among the dinucleotide repeats, the most and least frequent motifs were ga and cg, which accounted for 21% and  <dig> % of all the microsatellites, respectively .

out of  <dig> perfect microsatellites identified in sugarcane,  <dig>  were found in the orfs and the remaining were present either in the 3'utrs  or in the 5'utrs . the trinucleotide repeat motifs were significantly more frequent  in the orfs. in contrast, the ga-rich dinucleotide repeat motifs were more in the 5'  and 3'  utrs. the density of longer motif containing perfect class i microsatellites was one in every  <dig>  kb sequences, which accounted for  <dig> %  of the total  <dig> microsatellites identified .

development of unigene derived microsatellite  markers and evaluation of their polymorphic potential
the primer pairs could be designed for  <dig> perfect microsatellites that was  <dig> % of the total microsatellites  identified in the present investigation. the primer sequences flanking all the perfect ugms including  <dig> class i microsatellites with their tm values and product sizes are given in the additional file  <dig>  besides, the primer sequences for  <dig> compound class i ugms were designed and provided in the additional file  <dig>  to validate the ugms markers,  <dig> primer-pairs designed from different microsatellite containing unigenes were used in pcr amplification . one hundred sixty seven  of these produced clear and reproducible amplicons, whereas remaining nine  did not give amplification in the s. officinarum from which sequence the primers were designed. to verify that the primers did amplify the expected microsatellite repeat-motifs, the amplified products obtained with  <dig> of the primers in all the saccharum species and related genera as well as cereals were sequenced and the presence of the target microsatellite motifs as well the flanking sequences was observed in all the cases .

in silico polymorphism analysis was confined to saccharum officinarum and five cereal species namely, rice, wheat, maize, sorghum and barley for which unigene sequences were available in the database. the polymorphism based on variation in microsatellite repeat length was observed for a maximum of  <dig> primers  between sugarcane and barley followed by  <dig>  between sugarcane and wheat and least  between sugarcane and sorghum . the actual level of polymorphism detected by automated fragment analysis using  <dig> fluorescent dye labeled primers was much higher than that based on in silico analysis although the trend was maintained. s. officinarum had maximum polymorphism with barley  followed by wheat , rice , maize  and sorghum . forty-three  of the  <dig> primers detected polymorphism  among the  <dig> genotypes belonging to saccharum species, related genera, tropical and sub-tropical indian sugarcane varieties and five cereal species . this included  <dig>  amplifying dinucleotide repeats,  <dig>  trinucleotide repeats, two  tetranucleotide repeats, two  pentanucleotide repeats and two  amplifying hexanucleotide repeats. all the  <dig>  primers that targeted amplification of class i repeats and five  of the nine that targeted class ii repeats showed polymorphism among saccharum species, genera, varieties and cereal species. the microsatellites in the 5' and 3'utr sequences showed higher potential for polymorphism  as compared to that from the coding regions .

due to high polyploidy and heterozygosity of the saccharum genome, most  of the primers amplified two to three different loci  yielding a total of  <dig> loci with the number of alleles per locus ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and the allele size varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp across sugarcane species, genera and varieties  as well as five cereal species. the remaining  <dig>  primers gave single locus amplification  with  <dig> to  <dig> alleles each. overall, the  <dig> polymorphic primers amplified an average of  <dig>  alleles per ugms marker locus with a total of  <dig> alleles across  <dig> loci. forty-two  of the  <dig> informative primers revealed polymorphism between sugarcane species and related genera, whereas  <dig>  primers detected polymorphism among the indian commercial sugarcane varieties . twenty-six  of the  <dig> ugms marker loci showed heterozygosity in different genotypes used. maximum heterozygous loci was detected in five sugarcane species  followed by commercial varieties  and minimum  in the three related genera and five cereal species.

molecular basis of ugms polymorphism and its functional significance
comparison of fragment size  of variant alleles amplified at  <dig> polymorphic ugms loci with changes in number of repeats among saccharum complex, varieties and five cereal species revealed purely step-wise allelic distribution for  <dig>  loci, while remaining  <dig>  loci showed mixed type of allele size distribution . to elucidate the distribution pattern of ugms alleles showing fragment length polymorphism,  <dig> amplified size variant alleles each of two microsatellite primers namely, ugsum <dig> and ugsum <dig> showing both step-wise and mixed type of allele distribution were sequenced. high quality sequence alignment revealed that the size variant alleles showing step-wise distribution contained the expected microsatellite repeat sequences with conserved primer binding sites, but corresponded exactly to the step-wise multiples of the number of repeat units. the size variation of sequenced alleles was explained by differences in the number of repeat units. mixed type of allele distribution resulted from both variation in the number of repeat-units and insertions/deletions in the sequences flanking the ugms repeats. for instance, ugsum <dig>  and ugsum <dig>  showing both step-wise and mixed type allele size distribution had the expected n and n ugms motifs, respectively with varying number of repeat-units in different sugarcane species, genera, varieties and cereals along with a small stretch of nucleotide insertion/deletion in the flanking regions of target microsatellites.

in order to assess the functional significance of the ugms, gene ontology classification of  <dig> unigenes carrying perfect and compound microsatellites was carried out. six hundred seventy-two  of these  could be functionally annotated and were shown to encode enzymes for sugar metabolism , structural proteins , transcription and translation factors , signal transduction pathway proteins , cell growth and development factors  and disease resistance proteins  . three hundred sixty-four  of  <dig> unigenes contained microsatellite repeats in  <dig> different functional domains of proteins encoded by these unigenes  which included cytochrome b/c oxidase, chlorophyll a/b binding, fad and ubiquitin binding, sucrose synthase, alpha-amylase, acetyl coa, aldehyde dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, lipase, s-adenosylmethionine, leucine rich repeat , ferritin, protein kinase, chitinase, basic leucine zipper , zinc finger, tata box, myb and wrky dna binding domains . fifteen primers designed from  <dig> different unigenes targeting such functional domains  that gave single locus amplification and step-wise allele distribution  were selected for validation. all of these primers gave fragment length polymorphism among saccharum complex, varieties and five cereals based on variation in the number of ugms repeat-units within the functional domains.

one of these primers  showing polymorphism targeted the amylase catalytic domain of β-amylase . to understand the possible biological significance of the variable ugms repeat in the amylase domain, the structure predicted from the aminoacid sequences of the functional domain was analyzed in silico. it revealed variation in the active binding site involved in formation of the ca2+ ligand complexes due to the presence of variable number of repeats encoding leucine-serine aminoacid residues . this would most likely alter the function of amylase gene in respect of carbohydrate metabolism in sugarcane. similarly, the expansion/contraction of microsatellite motifs n encoding arginine-glutamine aminoacid residues was observed in the protein kinase functional domain of another sugarcane unigene which was amplified by the primer ugsum <dig>  in silico analysis suggested a novel secondary protein structure and catalytic domain binding site in the variant form that was different from the native form which contained  <dig> microsatellite repeats .

assessment of functional genetic diversity
the pair-wise similarity among  <dig> genotypes belonging to saccharum species, related genera and  <dig> tropical and sub-tropical indian varieties of sugarcane based on  <dig> fluorescent dye labeled polymorphic primers revealed a broad range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  similarity index. the similarity among the sugarcane species varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>   with an average of  <dig> . among the species, s. officinarum showed maximum similarity  with s. robustum followed by s. barberi with s. sinense . s. spontaneum was most divergent from the rest of the saccharum species. the similarity of the three genera of sugarcane, namely, erianthus, narenga and sclerostachya with the sugarcane species varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . erianthus had the least similarity with the saccharum species. similarity among the  <dig> indian tropical and sub-tropical sugarcane varieties varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>   with an average of  <dig> . the pair-wise similarity between the sugarcane species and varieties varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with average of  <dig> , while between the three related genera and varieties, it ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . the average similarity between the sub-tropical and tropical varieties  was slightly lower than the average pair-wise similarity measures within the sub-tropical  and tropical varietal groups .

the genetic relationship among the saccharum species, related genera, and tropical and sub-tropical varieties is depicted in figure  <dig>  the ugms markers clearly discriminated all the  <dig> genotypes from each other and resulted in a definitive grouping among different genera and species of saccharum with high bootstrap values  that corresponded well with their known pedigree relationships. all the clones of five saccharum species were included in the major cluster i in which s. officinarum and s. robustum clones were sub-clustered  with 98% occurrence in boot strap analysis; s. barberi and s. sinense clones grouped together in a separate sub-cluster  with 100% occurrence and s. spontaneum grouped distinctly from these sub-clusters with 92% occurrence. the three related genera of saccharum being highly divergent from the saccharum species and varieties, grouped in a separate cluster  with 98% occurrence.

all the tropical and sub-tropical varieties were included in a distinct and separate cluster  with seven distinct sub-clusters  with high  bootstrap value. the tropical variety co  <dig> grouped in a major sub-cluster iia with its tropical male parent co  <dig>  with a bootstrap value of 99%. in this sub-cluster , the other tropical varieties namely, co  <dig>  co  <dig>  co  <dig> and co  <dig> were also grouped together with average similarity of  <dig>   possibly because of their common ancestry involving co  <dig>  the two sub-tropical varieties, co  <dig> and co  <dig>  and three other sub-tropical varieties, copant  <dig>  co  <dig> and co  <dig>  in spite of having a common ancestor co  <dig>  were included in two distantly placed major sub-clusters; iib and iig, respectively. it could be due to inclusion of two diverse sub-tropical varieties, co  <dig> and colk  <dig> having common parent black cheribon within the sub-cluster iib. similarly, the clustering of two tropical varieties namely, coc  <dig> and co  <dig> in the sub-cluster iic with average similarity of  <dig>   and five tropical varieties, co  <dig>  co  <dig>  co  <dig>  co  <dig> and co  <dig> together in another separate large sub-cluster  with average similarity of  <dig>   was observed even though they had one common distant progenitor parent black cheribon. the grouping of sub-tropical varieties namely, co  <dig>  cos  <dig> and copant  <dig> in cluster iid with an average similarity of  <dig>   was clearly influenced by a common ancestry involving co  <dig>  the sub-tropical varieties, coj  <dig>  co  <dig> and cos  <dig> included in the cluster iie had common progenitor parent poj  <dig> that could have influenced their clustering with a high bootstrap value .

discussion
unigene resources representing the transcriptome of an organism provide opportunities to understand the sequence organization in the genic regions of complex polylploids and allow design of sequence based robust markers for various genotyping applications. considering the availability of a large unigene database of sugarcane in public domain, this resource was studied for the presence and functional relevance of different microsatellite repeats. the frequency of microsatellites in sugarcane unigenes  was lower than that obtained in rice, sorghum, barley and maize  but similar to wheat . in polyploids, extensive loss of duplicated genes and chromosomal rearrangement after polyploidization possibly have resulted in shortening and loss of microsatellite repeat-motifs from the genic coding sequences leading to dosage compensation, developmental stability and functional plasticity  <cit> . it would be of interest to explore the mechanism that restricts repeat expansion in genic regions of wheat and sugarcane leading to lower microsatellite frequency in these species.

the observed frequency of the mononucleotides  in sugarcane was much less than that reported earlier  <cit>  in the unigenes of maize , wheat , barley  and rice , but similar to sorghum . this suggested a lack of correspondence with genome size and ploidy. the presence of longer  a/t mononucleotide repeat-motifs in sugarcane is comparable to earlier observations on the nature and the frequency of such repeats in the genomic and est sequences of cereals  <cit> . the abundance of trinucleotide microsatellite motifs in the sugarcane unigenes is consistent with the earlier observations based on est sequences of sugarcane  <cit>  and unigene sequences of cereals  <cit> . the limited expansion of non-triplet microsatellites in the unigenes of sugarcane could be due to selection against frameshift mutations in the coding regions resulting from length changes in non-triplet repeats. we observed that more than 50% of the identified trinucleotide repeat motifs in sugarcane were gc-rich, possibly due to their high gc content  <cit>  and consequent usage bias in the coding sequences  <cit> . the abundance of gc-rich trinucleotide repeat motifs coding for small and hydrophilic aminoacid alanine and ga-rich dinucleotide motifs in sugarcane coding sequences parallels their abundance in cereal exons  <cit> . the ga-rich dinucleotide ugms motifs were observed particularly in the 5' and 3'  utrs with balanced  gc content and therefore would support better amplification as polymorphic markers  <cit> .

the unigenes being longer in higher quality sequences offer advantages over the est sequence resources for the development of microsatellite markers. in the present study,  <dig>  primer-pairs were designed from the  <dig> different unigene sequences carrying microsatellite repeats in the expressed component of the sugarcane genome. the primers designed from the unigene sequences flanking the microsatellite motifs were highly efficient with amplification success rate of  <dig> % that suggested the utility of the unigene database in designing sequence based robust genic markers. the paucity of usable and robust sequence based markers in sugarcane has been a major limitation in genetic analysis in this important sugar crop. the ugms markers developed by us have been placed in the public domain and thus would be immediately useful in various genotyping applications in sugarcane.

for most  of the unigene sequences from which the primers were designed, putative functions have been predicted. for instance, about 39% and 4% of the primers were from sequences related to sugar metabolic enzymes and disease resistance, respectively. interestingly, 54% of the microsatellite repeats were present in various functional domains of proteins encoded by the unigenes. correlation between fragment length polymorphism due to variable number of ugms repeat-units in the functional domains and alteration of the predicted protein structure and active ligand binding sites suggested functional relevance of the genic microsatellites. the evolutionary and adaptive advantages of such variable microsatellite repeats affecting the structure and function of the encoded proteins to generate favorable alleles for relaxation of environmental stress impact under the action of high natural selection pressure through modulation of mutation/recombination in these loci have been reported in many eukaryotes  <cit> . for instance, in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the expansion and contraction of microsatellite repeats in the coding regions of protein kinase genes have provided greater adaptability to various abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . sugarcane is a tropical crop. however, varieties adapted to subtropical condition have been developed in india. variation in microsatellites in the coding regions of these two groups was evident. for example, the tropical sugarcane varieties co <dig> and co <dig> contained  <dig> microsatellite repeats whereas varieties co <dig> and co <dig> adapted to sub-tropical condition showed contraction of ag repeats to  <dig> leading to alteration of protein structure and possibly function. understanding the adaptive significance of such variation is of relevance that needs further experimentation. designing of genic microsatellite markers targeting functional domains in solanaceous crops like tomato and pepper  <cit>  was reported. association of such markers with many traits including diseases like neuronal disorders  <cit>  and cancers  <cit>  in humans based on expansion/contraction of repeated tracts of microsatellites encoding aminoacid residues in the functional domains of proteins that changes their secondary structure and function has been demonstrated. the information generated in this study thus would allow selection of candidate gene-based markers for rapidly establishing marker-trait linkages in sugarcane.

the efficiency of sugarcane ugms markers to detect polymorphism within saccharum complex and among five cereals was evaluated in silico that was further validated experimentally. in silico polymorphism based on variation in length of the ugms repeat among s. officinarum and each of five cereal species could be due to divergent microsatellite evolution in these lineages  <cit> . the actual level of polymorphism detected by automated fragment analysis using fluorescent dye labeled primers was much higher than that based on in silico analysis. the expected relationship in evolution was reflected by actual polymorphism observed between sugarcane and cereals. with the use of automated fragment analysis system, all the allelic variants could be captured efficiently in a set of  <dig> sugarcane genotypes and five cereal species, thereby providing a platform for rapid, automated and large-scale genotyping of sugarcane. further, the allele size information generated would enable multiplexing of the ugms markers, thus making them useful in various high-throughput genotyping applications. the observed polymorphism  among the members of the saccharum species and related genera is higher than that estimated earlier using the fluorescent dye labeled sugarcane genomic  and est derived microsatellite markers . the higher potential of ugms markers particularly the longer class i di- and tetra-nucleotide repeat-motifs to detect polymorphism as compared to the class i trinucleotide and class ii motifs reflected correspondence between the type and length of repeats, and the level of polymorphism as observed earlier in sugarcane  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . higher polymorphic potential of ugms markers derived from the utrs than that from the conserved coding sequences, which are constrained by purifying selection  <cit>  suggested the utility of unigenes having such repeat-motifs as a source of polymorphic microsatellite markers.

the level of inter-varietal polymorphism  detected by the fluorescent dye labeled primers was higher than the level reported previously with the labeled sugarcane est derived  microsatellite markers. the discrepancies could be due to use of different sets of markers and genotypes. however, genotyping using the automated fragment analysis system in this study revealed comparable level of polymorphism with the genic and genomic microsatellite markers in sugarcane. it suggested that the genic microsatellite markers developed in this study would be highly informative and useful in sugarcane genetics, genomics and breeding.

unigene sequences usually have advantages of unique identity and position in the transcribed regions of the genome. if this is the case then primers designed from the unigene sequences flanking the microsatellite repeats should amplify unique single locus. in contrast, in the present study, multiple loci and thus amplification of multiple sequences of the same gene was observed for  <dig>  of the  <dig> primers designed from different microsatellite carrying unigenes. this is possibly due to poor representation of unigene sequences in the database that was scanned for microsatellite repeats. alternatively, all the copies of a microsatellite carrying gene that are pcr amplified might not be transcribed due to dosage compensation leading to silencing of all but one copy in the large polyploid sugarcane genome  <cit> . in spite of high polyploidy and heterozygosity of the sugarcane genome,  <dig>  of the  <dig> polymorphic ugms primers amplified a single discrete locus with step-wise allele distribution and showed fragment length polymorphism across the members of saccharum complex and varieties in an automated fragment analysis system. this could be due to polyploidization followed by selective gene loss  <cit>  resulting in retention of a single copy during evolution of saccharum. gene ontology analysis of these  <dig> unigenes showed correspondence with the genes coding for basic metabolic process of energy generation, degradation of cellular building blocks, dna recombination and repair proteins which played a vital role in plant biology and thus remained as single copy without alteration.

distribution pattern of size variant alleles amplified at ugms loci showed higher proportionate  distribution of alleles showing step-wise mutation than that of mixed allele distribution . high-quality sequence alignment of the size variant alleles showing both step-wise and mixed distributions confirmed the presence of variable number of repeat-units in different amplified alleles and additional insertions/deletions in the flanking regions of microsatellite repeat-motifs, which contributed to the ugms fragment length polymorphism observed in the saccharum complex, varieties and cereal species. such complex pattern of allele distribution and fragment length polymorphism at microsatellite loci due to variation in the copy number of microsatellite repeats and insertions/deletions in the flanking sequences of microsatellite motifs have been observed earlier in species like maize with a large genome size  <cit> .

it is important to evaluate molecular diversity existing among the members of the saccharum species and related genera, since major varietal improvement in sugarcane was through inter-specific hybridization. use of s. spontaneum and erianthus is vital since they carry many traits of agricultural importance including tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . identification of true inter-specific and inter-generic hybrids is crucial for successful transfer of the target traits. besides, monitoring of introgression is required to verify the transfer of the target genomic regions from the wild relatives to the cultivated genetic backgrounds.  <dig> % of markers revealed inter-specific and inter-generic polymorphism and thus would enable precise identification of inter-specific and inter-generic hybrids, and also provide opportunities to assess transfer of genic regions to desirable genetic backgrounds, thereby offering advantages over the random markers such as rapd and aflp.

evaluation of molecular diversity in a set of  <dig> commercial indian tropical and sub-tropical sugarcane varieties using unigene based genic microsatellite markers revealed a wider range  of genetic similarity than the level detected previously with rapd , maize microsatellite , sugarcane genomic microsatellite  and aflp  markers. hence, high efficiency of ugms markers in assaying functional diversity in the transcribed component of the sugarcane genome makes them valuable for understanding diversity pattern, and variety identification. the commercial indian sugarcane varieties used in this study were bred for either tropical or subtropical agro-climatic conditions with differential contribution of s. spontaneum, the most variable saccharum species  <cit> . the random markers assaying genetic variation largely in different non-genic genomic regions that contribute to large genome size  <cit>  would be of little relevance to phenotypic selection exercised during variety development. in contrast, the genic microsatellite markers assaying variation in the transcribed non-repetitive regions of the genome might be directly related to the phenotypic variation  <cit> . our results thus suggested that the genetic base of the indian sugarcane varieties is not very narrow particularly in the genic regions of the genome, which is most likely due to selection for wider adaptability of these varieties. the adaptive environment as well as parentage of these varieties corresponded well with the clustering pattern obtained using a small set of these markers, that further suggested the usefulness of the designed markers in realistic assessment of genetic diversity.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study identified microsatellites in sugarcane unigenes and assessed their functional relevance. a total of  <dig> primer-pairs were designed targeting  <dig> different unigenes carrying microsatellite repeats in the expressed component of the sugarcane genome, which would extend the accessibility of such microsatellite markers to researchers for many genetic studies in sugarcane. precise allele sizing in automated fragment analysis system has encouraging implications to various high-throughput genotyping applications in sugarcane. assessment of functional genetic diversity revealed that the genetic base of the indian sugarcane varieties is not narrow.
