BACKGROUND
micrornas  are one of the most abundant classes of small rnas  in plants and animals. these endogenous srnas were first identified in a metazoan called caenorhabditis elegans in  <dig>  <cit>  and were subsequently identified in plants  <cit>  and viruses  <cit> . mirnas are typically  <dig> nucleotides  in length and play regulatory roles at the post-transcriptional level by repressing translation or directly degrading target message rnas   <cit> . plant mirna genes are first transcribed into primary mirnas, and then processed into mirna precursors with stem-loop structures by dicer-like proteins. finally, they are released into the cytoplasm by cleavage into an mirna::mirna* duplex from the nucleus  <cit> . the mature mirnas join an rna-induced silencing complex , and the risc targets specific mrnas and downregulates the expression of target mrnas  <cit> . mirnas participate in various processes such as metabolism  <cit> , growth  <cit> , development  <cit> , biotic  <cit>  and abiotic  <cit>  stress tolerance.

an increasing body of evidence indicates that mirnas are involved in the plant drought stress response  <cit> . in arabidopsis, four drought-responsive mirnas  have been identified by microarray analysis  <cit> . in tobacco, nine mirnas strongly induced by drought stress have been experimentally identified, among which mir <dig> and mir <dig> are the two mirnas most sensitive to drought stress  <cit> . in rice,  <dig> mirnas have been identified as significantly down- or upregulated under drought stress using a microarray platform  <cit> . in medicago truncatula , wang et al.  mined drought-responsive mirnas on a genome-wide scale using the illumina sequencing technology;  <dig> members from four mirna families and  <dig> members of six mirna families were identified as up- and downregulated in response to drought, respectively  <cit> . li et al.  reported  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated mirnas by illumina sequencing and microarray profiling in populus euphratica   <cit> . furthermore, qin et al.  confirmed three upregulated and two downregulated mature mirnas in response to drought using a rt-qpcr assay  <cit> .

environmental stressors due to climate change, especially drought stress, could make forests increasingly vulnerable to disease and die-offs  <cit> . drought may have a profound effect on forest health  <cit> . with its modest genome size and rapid, widespread growth, p. trichocarpa was the first model forest species sequenced  <cit> . lu et al.  studied mirnas in p. trichocarpa and identified stress-responsive and novel mirnas by sanger sequencing technology  <cit> . an additional  <dig> novel p. trichocarpa mirnas were further identified by klevebring et al.  using the  <dig> sequencing method  <cit> . further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism of regulation of p. trichocarpa mirna in general and of drought-responsive mirnas in particular.

only  <dig> p. trichocarpa mirna precursors are annotated in the mirbase   <cit> , compared to  <dig> and  <dig> for oryza sativa and m. truncatula, respectively, two other model organisms. since the genome size of p. trichocarpa  is similar to that of m. truncatula  and rice , the potential for identification of new, specific mirnas in p. trichocarpa is great. in this context, high-throughput sequencing was used to identify non-conserved mirnas and drought-responsive mirnas with the new version of the poplar genome , which has not been used in previous research on p. trichocarpa. the targets of these conserved and novel mirnas were predicted, and some of them were confirmed by degradome sequencing. we discussed the potential regulatory mechanism between mirnas and their targets. this may help to unravel the mechanism of drought stress tolerance in p. trichocarpa and other plants.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing of p. trichocarpa leaves under control and drought conditions
according to a previous study on the relative soil moisture content  of water-deficient soil  <cit> , p. trichocarpa plants were subjected to control levels  and drought levels . the two libraries were sequenced by an illumina sequencer, yielding  <dig> , <dig> reads for the control library  and  <dig> , <dig> reads for the drought library  . after removing the low-quality sequences and adapter sequences,  <dig> , <dig> clean sequences in cl and  <dig> , <dig> clean sequences in dl were obtained, comprising  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences, respectively .

the size distribution of all unique srnas is summarized in figure 1a. the displayed length of p. trichocarpa srna ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, and the two major size classes were  <dig> nt  and  <dig> nt . this is in agreement with previous studies on srnas of p. trichocarpa  <cit>  and m. truncatula  <cit>  using high-throughput sequencing. to analyze the average abundance of each length between srnas of cl and dl further, we measured the ratio of raw and unique reads . the redundancies of srnas varied widely in length, and the  <dig> and  <dig> nt srnas displayed the highest redundancies. the average ratio of redundant and unique sequences of srnas of the two libraries showed obvious changes in  <dig> nt srnas; the redundancy of dl was  <dig> % greater than that of cl. this may be why drought stress strongly induced the expression of these  <dig> nt srnas; most conserved mirnas belong to this group.

after genomic annotation of the p. trichocarpa srnas, small interfering rna  and mirna with various important post-transcription regulating functions were the largest of our acquired sequences. the sirna is a  <dig> to  <dig> nt double-strand rna, each strand of which is  <dig> nt longer than the other on the 3’ end  <cit> . these aligned sequences might represent sirna candidates. in total, deep sequencing obtained  <dig>  and  <dig>  sirna candidates after the control and drought stress treatments, respectively . interestingly, the ratio of sirna reads to all srnas reads increased sharply from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . to obtain the annotation of known mirnas, srnas were aligned to the mirbase  <dig>  of p. trichocarpa. in total,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> sequencing reads were identified as known poplar mirnas in the two libraries. thirty-four families from  <dig> known mirnas were found, which accounted for about  <dig> % of the total members. the remaining  <dig> mirnas were not detected , possibly because of the tissue specificity of expression in poplar.

novel non-conserved mirnas from p. trichocarpa
after identifying potential sirnas and conserved mirnas from the unique srna sequences, the remaining srna sequences were potential candidate mirnas. for the identification of new mirna, the primary criterion was a stable hairpin structure. after pooling the reads of the two libraries and analyzing the precursors of potential mirnas using the mfold web server, we found  <dig> potential candidate mirnas . in compliance with the plant mirna criteria of meyers  <cit> , only  <dig> mirnas with star sequences from  <dig> families were chosen as novel non-conserved mirnas. of these,  <dig> mirnas were  <dig> nt long, eight mirnas were  <dig> nt, five mirnas were  <dig> nt and the remaining five were  <dig> nt long. the nucleotide bias at the first nucleotide showed a tendency to be u . this would allow for easier mirna risc loading assisted by ago protein  <cit>  and is consistent with the trend of conserved mirnas in plants  <cit> .

‘lm’, length of mirnas. ‘nt’, neuleotides. ‘lp’, length of precursors. ‘a’, refer to  <cit> ; ‘b’, refer to  <cit> ; ‘c’, refer to  <cit> ; ‘d’, refer to  <cit> ; ‘e’, refer to  <cit> ; ‘f’, refer to  <cit> .

these rna structures were predicted by mfold software and manually checked according to the criteria of meyers  <cit> . the lowest minimum free energy  of all hairpin structures of the novel mirnas precursors was − <dig>  kcal/mol , which is slightly lower than the threshold of − <dig> kcal/mol reported in a previous study  <cit> . all precursors of novel mirnas had regular hairpin structures , and four of these  are presented in figure  <dig> 

differential expression of mirnas in p. trichocarpa
to identify drought-responsive mirnas from p. trichocarpa, the number of normalized mirna reads of cl and dl were compared. based on the sequencing results, the differential expression of mirnas greater than two-fold were chosen for experimental validation by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction  . as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression patterns of the sequencing and rt-qpcr results of drought-responsive mirnas were consistent, both indicating that four mirnas  were upregulated after drought treatment, and that five mirnas  were downregulated by drought stress  <cit> .

we further analyzed the expressions of the  <dig> new mirnas under the two treatments. the drought-responsive mirnas are listed in figure 3; all were confirmed by the sequencing and rt-qpcr results. among the  <dig> mirnas, two novel mirnas  were downregulated by drought stress, and only mirn <dig> was upregulated in response to drought stress .

target analysis of novel and conserved mirnas by degradome sequencing
the previously known mirna targets also identified in this study are available on the popgenie site . for new mirnas whose targets were not known, we predicted their targets using the plant target prediction pipeline by the p. trichocarpa genome v <dig> . the rules used for target prediction were based on those suggested by allen et al.   <cit>  and schwab et al. , as follows:  no more than four mismatches between the srna and the target ;  no more than two adjacent mismatches in the mirna/target duplex;  no adjacent mismatches in positions 2– <dig> of the mirna/target duplex ;  no mismatches in positions 10– <dig> of the mirna/target duplex;  no more than  <dig>  mismatches in positions 1– <dig> of the mirna/target duplex ; and  the minimum free energy  of the mirna/target duplex should be equal or greater than 74% of the mfe of the mirna bound to its perfect complement  <cit> . we predicted  <dig> targets for  <dig> mirna families; the other six were not found .

the verification of mirna targets would provide further evidence for the existence of new non-conserved mirnas. to identify the mirna targets, two parallel analyses of rna ends  libraries were constructed for the p. trichocarpa degradome sequencing. in particular, the srna-cleaved mrnas ligated by 5′ rna adapters used for degradome sequencing acquired  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads  in the mrna libraries of the two treatments after removing redundancy;  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique reads could be matched to the p. trichocarpa genome  without mismatches   <cit> . fifty-three conserved and  <dig> new mirna-targeted transcript pairs were confirmed by degradome sequencing. the target transcripts were pooled and categorized into three classes with reference to arabidopsis <cit> . eleven pairs of mirnas and their targets belonged to category i, which accounts for the most abundant sequence reads at the cleavage site. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas and transcript pairs belonged to categories ii and iii, respectively. in addition,  <dig> target transcripts were predicted previously by either popgenie site or us .

‘cleavage site’, the cleavage site location at the area of coding sequence; ‘position penalty score’, the same penalty score as the prediction of new mirna targets; ‘mfe’, minimum free energy of the stem loop structure. the bold font of transcripts indicates that they were identified by prediction.

plant mirnas have a strong propensity for target genes with important functions  <cit> . according to the biological functions described by uniprot , these target transcripts can be grouped into nine categories. the majority of targets fall into the stress-response category, suggesting that these genes are drought-responsive . several other groups contain genes that regulate transcription, oxidative reduction, transport, and lipid metabolism. in this study, mir <dig> targeted a myb transcription factor, and ptc-mirn <dig> targeted an f-box family protein. the annotation of targets not only indicated some transcription factors and f-box proteins, but also some superoxide dismutases  and other proteins involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. a cu-zn sod was targeted by ptc-mirn <dig>  all of these results indicate that mirnas and their targets are reliable.

discussion
high-throughput sequencing of populus
in a comparison of six populus mirna studies   <cit> , two used traditional sanger sequencing  <cit> , two others used 454-pyrosequencing  <cit> , and the remaining two used the latest illumina sequencing technology   <cit> . along with the rapid development of sequencing technology, cl and dl can result in more sequences and greater sequencing depths than those reported in previous publications, due to the high throughput of the illumina sequencer. in our study, because of the in-depth search, a large number of novel non-conserved mirnas were found. the p. trichocarpa genome of version  <dig>  was used in this study; the transcript assemblies of the p. trichocarpa genome version  <dig>  are more meticulous than those of version  <dig> . this can increase the likelihood of finding more new mirnas in general and drought-induced novel mirnas in particular.

novel mirnas
compared to six previous studies of populus plants  <cit> , we identified  <dig> novel mirnas have been identified . eleven of these were found at least once. on comparing the mirna counts,  <dig> had counts greater than  <dig>  interestingly, two of the members of the ptc-mirn <dig> family are the most frequently and robustly mirnas identified in poplar high-throughput sequencing studies. furthermore, the counterparts of ptc-mirn <dig>  ptc-mirn <dig>  ptc-mirn54a, and ptc-mirn54b in p. beijingensis were verified by rt-qpcr  <cit> . this provides more, strong evidence for the novel mirnas identified from p. trichocarpa.

drought-responsive mirnas in p. trichocarpa
although mirnas have been shown to play an important role in the drought stress response of p. trichocarpa <cit> , little information on high-throughput sequencing of p. trichocarpa is available in this area. the present study on drought-responsive mirnas from p. trichocarpa will improve the understanding of the drought response of this species. we identified nine conserved mirnas and three novel mirnas that show significant changes in response to drought stress. the results were confirmed by both high-throughput sequencing and rt-qpcr. to obtain more information, we compared the identified drought-responsive mirnas with those identified in other studies   <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> have not yet found to be drought-responsive in populus plants, except in this research. in addition, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were found to be drought-responsive only in populus plants, including in this study. the regulatory direction of four mirnas  was identical in p. tomentosa and our research, which might be due to their close genetic relationship.

‘↑’, upregulated; ‘↓’, downregulated; ‘↑&↓’, some members were upregulated, some members were downregulated.

we further studied the target genes of these drought-responsive mirnas by sequencing of the degradome library and comparing our work to previous studies  <cit> . we found two upregulated mirnas  that were both predicted to target putative disease resistance proteins in p. trichocarpa   <cit> . the cross adaptation between disease resistance and drought stress tolerance in plants exists through unknown mechanisms. ptc-mir <dig> is another upregulated mirna; its arabidopsis homolog targets an myb transcription factor. the aba-induced accumulation of the mir <dig> homolog makes the myb transcript degradation desensitize hormone signaling during seedling stress responses in arabidopsis  <cit> . according to our degradome sequencing results, the ptc-mir <dig> was confirmed to target a methionine sulfoxide reductase . the homologs of msr were induced by biotic and abiotic stresses in plants  <cit> . they catalyze the reduction of methionine sulfoxide to methionine  <cit>  and play a major role in regulating the accumulation of reactive oxygen species , which can damage proteins in plant cells  <cit> . regulation of the msr gene by ptc-mir <dig> may occur through a homeostatic mechanism in response to drought stress in p. trichocarpa.

ptc-mir <dig> was also upregulated in drought stress. it targets a member of a plant-specific gras transcription factor gene family  <cit> . another member of this family  from p. euphratica was confirmed to play key roles in salt and drought stress tolerance  <cit> . in the present study, ptc-mir <dig> was confirmed to be targeted to vein patterning  <dig> , which belongs to a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase  superfamily  <cit> . the homolog of vep <dig> in arabidopsis was confirmed to be required for vascular strand development and to be upregulated by osmotic stress  <cit> . ptc-mir <dig> regulates the expression the gras protein and vep <dig>  both of which were responsive to drought stress, this may be the drought tolerance mechanism in p. trichocarpa.

the number of downregulated mirnas was larger than the number of upregulated mirnas. the two downregulated mirnas  were both identified to be cold-responsive mirnas in p. trichocarpa  <cit> . tmv-cg virus infection in arabidopsis causes the accumulation of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> . three auxin responsive factor  genes  are the targets of mir <dig>  <cit> . repression of arf <dig> by mir <dig> is critical for the seed germination and post-germination stages  <cit> . mir <dig> has been predicted targete six nac-domain proteins  from subfamily nac-a  <cit> , and nac-domain proteins have been confirmed to be important in drought stress tolerance  <cit> . these mechanisms may also be at work in drought-stress tolerance in p. trichocarpa for these two mirnas.

two downregulated mirnas  have been reported to be cu-responsive mirnas in p. trichocarpa. their targets include mir408-targeted plastocyanin-like proteins and mir1444-targeted all plastid polyphenol oxidases  <cit> . drought treatment may increase the relative concentration of cu ion in the cytoplasm. when the cu supply is sufficient, it is envisaged that the conjunction between mature mirnas and their precursors will be suppressed, leading to the upregulation of mirna-targeted cu proteins  <cit> . accordingly, the balance of cu ion contributes to the healthy growth and development of poplars during stress. in p. trichocarpa, ptc-mir1444a is reportedly downregulated by dehydration  <cit> , and ptc-1444b/c was also found to be downregulated by drought in this study. mir <dig> is reportedly downregulated by drought stress in rice  <cit>  and has been experimentally identified to target an early responsive dehydration-related  protein in p. trichocarpa. drought stress might induce the expression of erd protein by downregulating the expression of mir <dig> in p. trichocarpa. this may be one of the mechanisms of regulation of drought-stress tolerance  <cit> .

other downregulated mirna is ptc-mir <dig>  whose predicted targets are annotated as dehydration-responsive protein  and f-box proteins , which were recently reported to be differentially regulated by stress conditions and to play significant roles in the abiotic stress-response pathway. in arabidopsis, salt-induced mir <dig> targets the mrna of f-box proteins  <cit> .

from the analysis of predicted targets to downregulated ptc-mirn <dig>  a ccch-type zinc finger protein and two trichome birefringence-like proteins  were functionally predicted. although a cotton ccch-type zinc finger protein has been identified to enhance abiotic stress tolerance in tobacco  <cit> , we did not find any additional possible regulatory mechanisms between ccch-type zinc finger protein and drought tolerance in p. trichocarpa. the homolog of tblp in arabidopsis is important to the formation of crystalline cellulose in trichomes  <cit> . as previous studies have reported, trichome density increases with water shortage  <cit> , and the thick trichome layer could prevent water loss  <cit> . this may be the mechanism by which mirn <dig> regulates the expression of tblp to adapt to drought stress.

degradome analysis of non-drought-responsive mirnas
in arabidopsis, mir <dig> was reported to target tas genes  <cit> , while in p. trichocarpa, no tas homologs have been found  <cit> . from our study, the degradome sequencing data proved the adjustment mechanism of ptc-mir <dig> and lipoxygenases . the activity of lox protein can partially reduce the production of radicals and ros  <cit> . this may explain the regulatory mechanism of mir <dig> in poplars. four udpgs were found to be targeted by ptc-mir <dig>  and all were classified as category i. the udp-glucosyltransferases  are enzymes that attach a sugar molecule to a specific acceptor in plants  <cit> . as in arabidopsis, the udpg is a key regulator of stress adaption through auxin iba  <cit>  and plays a role in fine-tuning nitrogen assimilation in cassava  <cit> . this is a novel mechanism by which mir <dig> regulates the udpg gene family in p. trichocarpa.

the degradome sequencing results imply that the mirnas with no detected targets may silence genes by repressing translation. however, we could not obtain information about translation repression by mirna through degradome sequencing. only  <dig> targets of new mirnas were identified. the targets of these non-conserved mirnas are difficult to detect, possibly because of low abundance or a spatial expression pattern. more studies are needed to shed light on the regulation network of these mirnas in p. trichocarpa. over-expressing or repressing expression of these mirnas in p. trichocarpa may help to elucidate the regulation mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, srna libraries and degradome libraries of control and drought treatments were constructed with poplar leaves for high-throughput sequencing. twelve mirna members in  <dig> families were confirmed to be responsive to drought stress, and  <dig> novel mirnas with star sequences of  <dig> families were identified. through degradome sequencing,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified as cleavage targets of annotated mirnas and new mirnas, respectively. the functions of mirna targets were analyzed and discussed. this study provides useful information for further analysis of plant mirnas and drought stress tolerance, particularly in populus plants.
