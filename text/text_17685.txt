BACKGROUND
in the old world, the sand fly phlebotomus  perniciosus  is one of the major vectors of leishmania infantum , the parasitic protozoan that causes visceral and cutaneous leishmaniases in humans and canine reservoir hosts . p. perniciosus is also a vector for various known and emerging arboviruses considered relevant from a public health perspective  <cit> . described for the first time in malta by newstead in  <dig>  p. perniciosus is widely distributed in the western mediterranean basin, from morocco to libya in north africa and from portugal to croatia in europe. one of the most important endemic foci of canine and human visceral leishmaniases of this area is located in italy, in the campania region  <cit> . leishmaniases are diseases of great public health concern affecting  <dig> countries around the world with an estimated incidence of  <dig> – <dig>  million new cases each year  <cit> . due to climate and social changes, leishmaniases are becoming a worldwide re-emerging public health problem, with an expanding endemicity and more than  <dig> million people estimated at risk of transmission world-wide  <cit> . despite their importance as disease vectors, sand flies remain understudied relative to mosquitoes and other important vectors and relatively little is known about their biology, their feeding and reproductive behaviour under natural conditions, and about their genetics  <cit> .

in the recent years, the advent of the next generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics applied to the study of insects have paved the way for the fast identification and characterization of genes involved in relevant biological processes . nowadays, the number of insect genomes and transcriptomes available is increasing exponentially in public databases  <cit>  . this allows for easier and faster comparative studies between related species.

to date two unpublished genome sequencing projects of the new world species lutzomyia longipalpis  and of the old world species p. papatasi  and a few transcriptomics studies are available for sand fly species. most transcriptomics studies, performed with est sequencing, have focused on sand fly salivary glands and the role of saliva in pathogen-vector-host interactions , on sand fly-leishmania interactions  and on the analysis of sand fly specific tissues  <cit> . only three studies have performed a global sand fly transcriptome analysis, the first two using est sequencing technology  <cit>  and the third by  <dig> pyrosequencing on wild individuals of l. longipalpis  <cit> . in addition, only two studies are available about the salivary gland and midgut transcriptome of p. perniciosus  <cit> .

in the present paper, we report the de novo transcriptome assembly and the differential expression analysis of adult males and females of the sand fly p. perniciosus. this analysis led to the identification of about  <dig> sex-biased genes and represents the first next generation sequencing study with illumina technology for a sand fly species. the data set constitutes a relevant resource for future genome annotation projects for p. perniciosus and for evolutionary comparative studies with other sand fly species and other blood-sucking nematocera species, such as mosquitoes , biting midges  and black flies . in particular, our data can be useful for the study of genes involved in the control of sex-specific traits such as host-parasite interaction, reproductive biology, somatic sexual development and sex determination, accelerating the discovery of potential targets for vector-based control strategies against leishmaniasis and other arthropod-borne diseases.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly of the p. perniciosus transcriptome
to generate a comprehensive adult reference transcriptome of p. perniciosus and to investigate sex-biased gene expression levels at adult stage, we produced six illumina rna-seq libraries, with an average insert size of 130 bp, from three pools of adult sand flies for each sex. illumina deep sequencing of the libraries yielded about  <dig> million paired-end reads that were combined, quality filtered, and de novo assembled using the trinity software  <cit> . we obtained  <dig>  assembled transcripts with a minimum length of 201 bp and a n <dig> value of 2376 bp. the assembled transcripts were grouped in gene clusters  using corset  <cit>  and, after discarding clusters with less than  <dig> mapped reads, we obtained  <dig>  corset clusters of which  <dig>   contain only one transcript isoform, while the remaining  <dig> clusters  have 2– <dig> transcript isoforms . we selected the longest transcript of multiple isoform corset clusters as representative of the cluster, obtaining a final data set of  <dig>  unique transcripts that we named the “perni” data set. sequencing and assembly statistics are summarized in table  <dig> and an overview of the assembly, the annotation and the differential expression analysis workflow is presented in fig.  <dig>  sequencing data were deposited into the short read archive  of the ncbi .table  <dig> summary of sequencing and assembly statistics

transcriptome quality assessment
we validated the perni data set for sequence completeness using three different approaches. first, we applied the ortholog hit ratio metric   <cit> , which provides an estimate of the length of the assembled transcripts using their coding regions. ohr compares the length of the coding region between a newly assembled transcript and its ortholog of a reference transcriptome. if the two have the same length, then the reconstructed transcript is likely to correspond to the full length real mrna, including the upstream and downstream untranslated regions, and the ohr =  <dig>  values of ohr <  <dig> suggest incompleteness. we calculated ohr values of  <dig> perni transcripts chosen to have best reciprocal tblastx hits  with the d. melanogaster transcriptome . in ~70 % of the cases, hits cover at least 50 % of the corresponding drosophila transcript coding regions . similar results were obtained on  <dig> perni transcripts using as reference the transcriptome of the sand fly p. papatasi, available at the vectorbase web site , with average and median ohr values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . our results are comparable to the efficiencies observed in other de novo assembled transcriptomes of insects .

next, we compared the perni data set with  <dig> p. perniciosus nucleotide sequences available in the ncbi genbank database , mostly ests from a midgut transcriptome analysis  <cit> . the  <dig> available sequences of p. perniciosus were clustered using cd-hit  <cit>  with default parameters to obtain  <dig> unique sequences with a n <dig> value of 798 bp to be used for bidirectional blastn analysis  with the perni data set. we observed that while only 2 % of the perni data set matched available p. perniciosus sequences, 77 %  of the p. perniciosus sequences available in genbank matched transcripts in the perni data set. furthermore, we observed that  <dig> out of these  <dig> p. perniciosus sequences available in genbank are shorter than their corresponding transcripts in the perni data set. besides validating it, these results indicate that the de novo assembly presented here improves the coverage and the average transcript length of p. perniciosus.

finally, to test the ability to detect transcripts with low expression, we searched for three low-abundance salivary transcripts identified in other closely-relative sand fly species that are not yet identified in p. perniciosus  <cit>  : the hyaluronidase, pyrophosphatase and adenosine deaminase genes. we performed a blastp search of the protein sequences  against the perni data set. despite the perni data set deriving from whole body male and female adults, for each of the three low-abundance salivary-specific genes, we identified a full p. perniciosus assembled orthologous transcript with a complete orf . in additional file 2: figure s <dig> we reported the multiple alignment of these three putative proteins of p. perniciosus with orthologous proteins present in genbank.

overall, these results indicate that we produced a high quality de novo assembly of p. perniciosus transcriptome that matches and improves existing information and includes transcripts of genes with low expression.

functional annotation
prediction of protein coding transcripts
we assigned functional annotation to the perni data set using the annocript pipeline  <cit>  with default parameters and using the uniprotkb  as reference. the assembled and annotated perni data set is freely accessible at http://pernibase.evosexdevo.eu. we found that about  <dig>  perni transcripts  had significant similarity  to proteins in the uniprotkb database. among them, about twelve thousands perni transcripts  have at least one functional annotation . in particular,   <dig> transcripts  mapped to go terms;   <dig>  had at least one enzyme hit in the enzyme database ;   <dig>   had at least one domain annotation in pfam database ;   <dig>  were assigned to an unipathway metabolic pathway  . similarly to other recently released transcriptomes of dipteran insects  <cit> , among the  <dig> perni transcripts with an assigned go term we observed  <dig> go functional categories belonging to biological process , cellular component  and molecular function , suggesting that transcripts in the assembly presented here cover a wide spectrum of biological processes .fig.  <dig> summary of the functional annotation results. the bar plot represents the number of transcripts of the perni data set for each annotation category



we then compared the go terms distribution of the perni data set with that of the two available sand fly transcriptome data sets, the new world species lutzomyia longipalpis and the old world species p. papatasi  <cit> . to prevent bias from different annotations methods the l. longipalpis and the p. papatasi data sets were re-annotated using the annocript pipeline with default parameters, obtaining results in general agreement with previous annotations of the two sand fly transcriptomes  <cit> . the overall distribution of the go terms are similar for the three sand fly species . in particular, in the mf category the “atp binding” and the “nucleic acid binding” terms are the most abundant  in all the species. in the bp category, the two most represented terms are “transcription”  and “regulation of transcription” . in the cc category, the two most abundant terms are “integral to membrane”  and “nucleus” . one interesting exception in the comparison of the three sand fly transcriptomes was a significant enrichment in the perni data set with respect to the bp term “dna integration”  and of the mf term “rna-directed dna polymerase activity”  . we performed a more specific search of transposable elements in the perni data set using the protein-based repeatmasker algorithm with default parameters . we observed that about 5 % of the perni data set is constituted by transposable elements with the most abundant classes represented by ltr retrotrasposons of gipsy and pao subclasses. we obtained comparable results analyzing with the same software the p. papatasi and l. longipalpis transcriptomes .fig.  <dig> go term distribution of the annotated transcripts of the perni data set compared with those of p. papatasi and l. longipalpis. go categories are shown within the divisions of biological process , molecular function , and cellular component . column heights reflect the percentage of annotated transcripts in each assembly that mapped to a given go term. asterisks indicate the statistical significance of the differences observed in the pair-wise comparison between p. perniciosus and p. papatasi and between p. perniciosus and l. longipalpis 



prediction of putative long non-coding rnas
the annocript annotation pipeline performs also a prediction of the putative long non-coding rnas  through the portrait software, which uses support vector machine and is optimized for non-model organisms  <cit> . in brief, a transcript is annotated as non-coding if it has  no match in public databases,  a portrait non-coding probability >  <dig> ,  a transcript length > 200 bp and  an orf <  <dig> aa. using annocript, we predicted  <dig> putative lncrnas in p. perniciosus. however, to obtain a more reliable prediction of the lncrnas, we combined the portrait results with the predictions from two other cpat  <cit>  and cpc  <cit>  which use logistic regression and machine-learning methods, respectively. we set a very stringent threshold in both cases . when considering the intersection among the three prediction methods we predict as putative lncrnas of p. perniciosus  <dig> perni transcripts  with a length range of 201–1575 bp, a n <dig> value of 340 bp and a gc content of  <dig>  %, lower than that of the whole perni data set , in agreement with the low gc content of the lncrnas described in other insect species  <cit> . low gc content is emerging as a feature of the long non-coding transcripts, at least in humans where they are mainly studied  <cit> . this finding supports the reliability of our prediction .

prediction of putative novel protein coding transcripts
in addition to the  <dig>  annotated perni transcripts and the  <dig> putative lncrnas, the perni data set contains  <dig> unannotated perni transcripts  with an open reading frame longer than  <dig> aa , a gc content of  <dig>  % and predicted as coding by portrait , cpat  and cpc  software . a tblastx analysis against the p. papatasi transcriptome revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> perni transcripts have a highly conserved match  . these perni transcripts might encode for novel proteins specific of the subfamily phlebotominae and not present to date in the public databases.

expression level analysis
the relative expression level of the assembled perni data set was assessed in pooled illumina reads of males and females, by the fpkm metric   <cit>  using the rsem software  <cit> . in the perni data set fpkm values vary from less than  <dig> to  <dig>   suggesting a wide range of expression levels . we classified perni transcripts as:  not expressed if fpkm was < <dig> ,  weakly expressed if 1 < fpkm <  <dig> ,  moderately expressed if 10 < fpkm <  <dig> , and highly expressed if fpkm >  <dig> . overall, we concluded that vast majority of transcripts are weakly or not expressed, while only a very small fraction is highly expressed, with no substantial differences between males and females . among highly expressed transcripts  we found a significant enrichment  for  <dig> go terms in females and  <dig> in males , suggesting that highly expressed transcripts regulate sex-specific functions.

to validate the results of the in silico expression analysis, we selected ten transcripts in the perni data set and evaluated their relative expression by real time pcr . in particular, we selected four perni transcripts with similar fpkm values in both sexes, three perni transcripts, which seems to be male-biased and three apparently female-biased according with their fpkm values . we included the p. perniciosus orthologs of the apyrase  and the act- <dig> genes  which in mosquitoes are known to be female- and male-biased, respectively  <cit> . the first crucial step of the relative qpcr technique is the selection of the best transcript to use as reporter in the subsequent normalization. for this reason, we selected five putative reporter transcripts , analyzed their expression levels by qpcr and examined the results using the normfinder software  <cit> . among the five putative reporters selected, sod  and gpdh  were observed to be the most stable between adult males and females of p. perniciosus. consequently, we decided to use both as reference genes in our relative quantization experiments. the normalized expression values  of the selected transcripts of p. perniciosus in males and females were compared to the respective normalized fpkm values , resulting in statistically significant positive correlation. in particular, the pearson correlation coefficient r was  <dig>  in males  and  <dig>  in females , showing a good agreement between the results obtained from the in silico and in vivo expression analysis. this is the first report on the selection of reporter genes in adult males and females of p. perniciosus and this result will be useful in all future studies on gene expression in this species.

differential expression analysis
sexual dimorphism is marked between male and female sand flies with many morphological, behavioral, and physiological traits, which are typical for each sex. in particular, females are usually heavier than males while males have prominent external terminalia, with a relatively minute and slight abdomen compared to the females. furthermore, closely related sand fly species can often be properly identified only using the species-specific morphology of sex-specific traits such as the dilatation of the distal part of the spermathecal ducts in females or the morphology of the copulatory valves  in males  <cit> . complex sexually dimorphic phenotypes in animals are mainly the result of differential expression between males and females of the same gene  <cit> , however nothing is known in p. perniciosus. therefore, to begin the study of the molecular bases of the sexual dimorphism in sand flies we interrogated our data set to identify genes differently expressed between adult males and females of p. perniciosus.

we performed a differential gene expression  analysis between males and females by using the edger software  <cit>  as implemented in the trinity package. we used the gene-level counts for each biological replicate obtained by the corset software. the quality control, performed with trinity scripts , revealed the high quality of the replicates, with low level of outliers and high correlation within each group . the dge analysis identified  <dig> perni transcripts  differentially expressed  between sexes  with a fold change  ranging from  <dig>  to more than  <dig>  . the sex-biased corset clusters, the corresponding perni transcripts, the mapped read counts, the fpkm values and their annotations are listed in the additional file 12: table s <dig>  as a positive control, the p. perniciosus orthologs of the apyrase and act- <dig> genes, previously investigated, are present among the statistically significant de genes in agreement with their sex-biased expression pattern in mosquitoes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> differential expression analysis. differential gene expression analysis of adult male vs. female whole bodies of p. perniciosus. a volcano plot showing the relative expression levels of the transcripts in adult male versus adult female whole body. the x-axis represents the log <dig> of the expression fold change  for each transcript of the perni data set. the y-axis represents the negative log <dig> of the adjusted p-value  of the fisher’s exact test. blue data points  represent the transcripts that were statistically significant sex-biased . dotted vertical lines represent the biological cut-off of 2-fold change in expression between males and females. b ma-plot showing the relative expression levels of the transcripts in adult male versus adult female whole body. the x-axis represents the log <dig> of the counts per million of mapped reads  for each transcript of the perni data set. the y-axis represents the log <dig> of the expression fold change  for each transcript of the perni data set. blue data points  represent the transcripts that were statistically significant sex-biased . c histogram of the log <dig> of the expression fold change  values between the  <dig> sex-biased perni transcripts. dotted orange vertical lines represent the biological cut-off of 2-fold change in expression between males and females. d stack plot of the distribution of the annotation types of the sex-biased perni transcripts



the vast majority of sex-biased transcripts  have a functional annotation in the uniprotkb database. this figure represented 52 % of the  <dig>  annotated transcripts. in addition,  <dig> out of  <dig> sex-biased transcripts were annotated as lncrnas  and  <dig> out of  <dig> were annotated as putative novel protein coding genes  . a rna-seq study conducted on whole body adult samples of drosophila melanogaster revealed that the percentage of the male-biased annotated transcripts is  <dig>  % and the female-biased is  <dig>  %  <cit> . this higher percentage of male-biased genes was attributed to the transcriptional complexity of the testes of the fruit fly  <cit> . in p. perniciosus the percentage of the annotated male-biased genes  is very similar to that observed in drosophila. conversely, in p. perniciosus we observed a much higher percentage of annotated female-biased genes  relative to male-biased genes. this result is in agreement with the sex-biased expression in sugar-fed adults of the mosquito anopheles gambiae, where the percentage of the female-biased genes is higher than that of the male-biased  <cit> .

to identify gene classes enriched in the sex-biased perni transcripts we selected the annotated male- and female-biased perni transcripts with a fc >  <dig>  and we performed a go term enrichment analysis for each sex using a r plugin of the annocript software and applying the fisher exact test . we identified  <dig> enriched go terms in females and  <dig> in males . among the enriched terms of females, most are involved in rna metabolism, translation and oogenesis. in males, most of the enriched terms are related to transcription, signal transduction and response to stimuli . interestingly, among the male enriched go terms we observed the monooxygenase activity . male-specific insect monooxygenases were found in the male reproductive system of blattella germanica  <cit> , d. melanogaster  <cit>  and ips paraconfusus  <cit>  but their role remains unknown. considering the importance of this enzyme family in the development of insecticide resistance in insects, it deserves further attention in future studies.

as a validation of the dge analysis, we examined the sex-specific expression pattern of the top  <dig> de perni transcripts , chosen to have fdr value equal to zero and an fpkm value >  <dig> in at least one sex , performing a semi-quantitative rt-pcr experiment. only  <dig> out of  <dig> of the selected de perni transcripts have a functional annotation .

we obtained an amplification product of the expected molecular size for all the female-biased and  <dig> out of 20male-biased de perni transcripts, confirming the quality of our dge analysis . the remaining three male-biased de perni transcripts did not produce any amplification product. we hypothesize that this could be due to errors in the assembly of the three transcripts.fig.  <dig> semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis of the top sex-biased perni transcripts. semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis of selected transcripts of male and female adults of p. perniciosus. a normalization control using primer pairs for the sod gene of p. perniciosus at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> pcr amplification cycles. b amplification of female-biased perni transcripts. for the transcript f <dig> we observed an extra male-specific amplification signal of larger molecular size. c amplification of male-biased perni transcripts. for the transcript m <dig> we observed an extra male-specific amplification signal of larger molecular size and for the transcripts m5a, m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> we observed extra female-specific amplification signals of larger molecular size. for the transcript m <dig> we observed an extra non-sex-specific amplification signals of larger molecular size. λ indicates the molecular weight marker 



interestingly, in some pcr amplifications we obtained unexpected additional fragments. in particular, we got a male-specific larger fragment in the de perni transcripts f <dig> and m1; a female-specific larger fragment in the de perni transcripts m5a, m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m19; a non-sex-specific larger fragment in the de perni transcript m <dig>  we examined the unclustered trinity assembly output to search for the presence of alternative isoforms of these nine de perni transcripts and we found assembled alternative isoforms only for the m <dig> and m <dig> transcripts . to verify the nature of the eight sex-specific alternative amplified fragments, we performed sequencing experiments, obtaining positive results for five de perni transcripts . the numerous attempts to clone and sequence the alternative fragments of m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> de perni transcripts have failed. the direct sequencing of the alternative fragments of the de perni transcripts f <dig>  m5a, m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  revealed the presence in each of them of an additional nucleotide sequence with conserved 5’ and 3’ intron consensus sites nncag/g) . this result suggests that these additional amplification fragments might be produced by sex-specific alternative splicing events, via intron retention rather than alternative exon usage. further analyses are required to clarify if the postulated sex-specific alternative splicing is somatic or germinal. these five transcripts have not been annotated by our analysis pipeline neither as coding nor as non-coding, but the presence of sex-specific alternative splicing let us hypothesize they might have a functional role.

evolutionary analysis
non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates and their ratio ka/ks can be used to infer the selective pressure acting on the nucleotide coding sequences. in particular, a ka/ks value lower than one indicates that the compared sequences are subjected to purifying constraint for amino acid substitutions. conversely, when the ka/ks value is equal or higher than one the sequences are evolving neutrally or under positive selection, respectively.

to evaluate the evolutionary forces acting on the orthologous genes between two phlebotominae species belonging to the same and to different genera, we measured the pairwise ka/ks ratio from the back-translated codon alignment of  <dig> putative orthologs between p. perniciosus and p. papatasi  and of  <dig> putative orthologs between p. perniciosus and l. longipalpis . putative orthologs between species were identified by pairwise blastp analysis  and aligned using the software paraat  <cit> . for all genes ka/ks was always <  <dig> with mean ka/ks very similar for both comparisons  showing that a strong purifying selection is acting on the ortholog genes in both the comparisons.

merging of the two orthologous data sets yielded  <dig> putative orthologs genes common to the three phlebotominae species. for  <dig> of them ka/ks value is higher than  <dig>  between p. perniciosus and p. papatasi and lower than  <dig>  between p. perniciosus and l. longipalpis indicating a relaxation of the selecting constrains on these genes in the two phlebotomus species when compared to l. longipalpis . interestingly, of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are sex-biased in p. perniciosus . these findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that the relaxation of purifying selection, more than the positive selection, might be associated to sex-biased gene expression and drive phenotypic evolution, as described for solenopsis invicta and apis mellifera  <cit> . further studies are required to confirm these preliminary results, focusing the evolutionary analyses on wild populations of p. perniciosus and/or extending the comparison to other phylogenetically related insect species.fig.  <dig> ka/ks plot. plot representing the distribution of the ka/ks values between p. perniciosus/l. longipalpis and p. perniciosus/p. papatasi. blue dots represent the ortholog pairs showing relaxation of selective constrains in the comparison p. perniciosus/p. papatasi




CONCLUSIONS
we presented the first adult reference transcriptome of p. perniciosus and its differential expression and evolutionary analysis. our results represent a relevant resource for functional studies in the sand fly and provides baseline knowledge for future studies on sex-specific gene expression and pathways. furthermore, our data will be useful to perform comparative analyses among phlebotomine sand flies and other insect species, e.g. mosquitoes, to dissect regulatory and biochemical pathways involved in arthropod blood feeding, host-parasite interactions, reproductive biology and somatic sexual differentiation. finally, the annotated genes constitute an important toolkit that could enhance the discovery of new potential targets for vector-based control strategies against leishmaniases and other arthropod-borne diseases.
