BACKGROUND
biological networks are abstract representation of biological systems, which capture many of their essential characteristics  <cit> . computational modeling of biological networks predominantly obtains insight into their systems behaviors. special attention is paid to the dynamical networks of cell cycle transitions, circadian rhythms and apoptosis  <cit> . apoptosis, which evolves in an all-or-none fashion, is a self-defense machinery to eliminate cells that are potentially dangerous  <cit> . the process of cell death decision concerns an integration of multiple malignant inputs. once the decision has been made, this event is considered to be a 'point of no return'.

apoptosis is a precisely regulated program in response to cellular stress. the tumor suppressor p <dig> plays essential roles in mediating apoptosis progress as evidenced by frequent mutations of p <dig> in tumors  <cit> . activation of p <dig>  which triggers a transcription regime, is a critical response in cell death decision  <cit> . known targets for p <dig> in promoting apoptosis include puma, noxa, bid, bax, as well as other death inducing factors, such as p53aip, dr <dig>  caspase- <dig>  perp and fas  <cit> . some negative regulators are also p <dig> transcriptional targets. a well documented p53-inducible protein, mdm <dig>  targets p <dig> for proteosome degradation and keeps p <dig> at low levels in unstressed state  <cit> .

mitochondria play a crucial role in apoptosis by sensing external and/or internal apoptotic signals and responding by mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization . momp is characterized by permeabilization pores formation and release of apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c, smac/diablo and omi/htra  <dig> from mitochondria inter-membrane space, which will trigger caspase activation and initiate a serial downstream events to ensure apoptosis  <cit> . although the exact mechanism of momp remains elusive, most experiments support that momp is governed by intricate interactions among bcl- <dig> family members. bcl- <dig> family members are composed of three functional groups: pro-apoptotic multi-domain proteins , anti-apoptotics , and bh3-only proteins   <cit> . in resting cells, bax predominantly exists as soluble monomers in the cytosol, while monomeric bak is inserted into mitochondria outer membrane  <cit> . in response to apoptotic stimuli, bax monomers translocate from the cytosol to mom, and both bax and bak oligomerize to form permeabilization pores which contribute to momp  <cit> . anti-apoptotic members block cell death following numerous insults. bcl- <dig>  together with its anti-apoptotic group members, functions as potent apoptosis inhibitors by binding to bax/bak and bh3-only proteins to block their functions  <cit> . the third group terms 'bh3-only'. selected bh3-only members termed 'activator' are sufficient to trigger a conformational change and oligomerization of bax/bak, while other bh3-only members termed as 'enabler' can displace 'activator' from the sequestration of anti-apoptotics  <cit> .

mdm <dig> is p53-inducible and functions as a negative regulator of p <dig>  this pattern confirms a negative feedback which is fundamental for p <dig> oscillations. indeed, damped oscillations of p <dig> have been observed in cell populations  <cit> . several mathematical models have been proposed to explain the damped oscillation over cell population. bar-or et al. presented a simplified model in an attempt to explain the mechanism of damped oscillation  <cit> , and similar dynamics were also presented by monk et al. when introduced a time delay  <cit> . in a field-breaking study of p53-mdm <dig> in individual cells, alon and his coworkers found the expression of p <dig> follows a series of pulses and the mean period of the oscillations are relatively fixed while the mean number of pulses increase with increasing irradiation dose  <cit> . this is called 'digital oscillation'. the preeminent model explaining the digital behavior comes from ma et al.  <cit> . they introduced a stochastic process in damage repair process to reproduce the digital pulses successfully. ciliberto et al.  <cit>  and chickarmane et al.  <cit>  manipulated the p <dig> system from stable steady state to a region of stable limit cycle in response to damage, which is then drawn back when damage is eliminated. zhang et al. compared these models and delineated several new scenarios although the speculated mechanisms seemed to be cell type specific  <cit> . alon and his coworkers also found that p <dig> performs sustained oscillation with γ-irradiation in tumor cell lines when observations lasted longer  <cit> . batchelor et al. found a key mediator wip <dig> in p <dig> signaling and consolidated p <dig> performs sustained oscillation  <cit> . several models focused on deciphering this phenomenon. puszynski et al. evaluated the oscillation and bistability in stochastic p <dig> system and proposed that deficiency in phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten  regulations contributes to the sustained oscillation  <cit> . proctor et al. reconstructed two minimal models in p <dig> regulation and showed highly variable p <dig> pulses, however, one of their constructions referred to arf pathway  <cit> . although numerous models aimed to illustrate the digital or sustained pulses of p <dig> to fit experimental results, several questions remain elusive. first, how does the sustained p <dig> oscillation in tumor cell lines originates from the well studied digital p <dig> pulses? second, what is the physiological role of p <dig> pulses on dna damage? similar questions raised by tyson in a recent review showed aspirations for elucidating the linkage between digital and sustained oscillations and for the emergence of a counting mechanism of p <dig> pulses  <cit> .

in the paper, we proposed a plausible model to clarify two key questions in this field: . how sustained oscillation of p <dig> originates from digital oscillations. . how cells count p <dig> pulses and make a decision between survival and death. three modules of p <dig> network  were interconnected. the interlinked positive feedbacks in atm activation module confirm a bistable switch, which controls downstream p53-mdm <dig> module. the atm switch can turn off the p <dig> pulses when damage is repaired and thus elicit digital p <dig> pulses. a mutant switch with high basal dna damage, however, can never turn off the downstream oscillation. in addition, we proposed that the 'bax activation switch' as described in our previous work can 'count' p <dig> pulses through accumulated puma and decide cell fate. our modeling successfully provided a plausible mechanism of p <dig> pulses in governing dna damage-induced cell death decision.

RESULTS
our models are based on established biological facts and supplemented by some assumptions and simplifications. the schematic representation of p <dig> network is given in figure  <dig>  the details and necessary model simplifications are described in "methods". the model can be further dissected into three functionally connected sub-modules, the interconnections of which are based on the input-out patterns . we then investigated the bifurcation properties of each function module.

atm activation switch 
we represented how atm shows bistability and transmits damage signals. figure 2a depicts the bifurcation diagram. a sub-threshold damage  only activates minimal fractions of atm. once damage is repaired, activated atm rapidly drops to low levels. when damage overrides the threshold level, activated atm rapidly jumps to a high level and finally becomes fully activated . the levels of activated atm will not fall until the remaining double strand breaks  visits the limit point . the solid curve indicates stable steady state, while the dashed line means unstable steady state. bistability primarily comes from positive feedback. in our model, atm is subject to two positive feedback loops: one originates from interactions with mre11-rad50-nbs <dig>  complex and the other from auto-activation , which primarily lead to bistability. cooperation of them quickens the transition from 'off' to 'on' state  <cit> , ensuring accelerated upswing of activated atm levels. experimental results indicated an abruptly onset of activated atm and reaches saturation within an hour or minutes  <cit> , which is consistent with our simulation results. our results above suggest the interconnected positive feedback ensures bistability for atm.

p53-mdm <dig> interaction module
we next proceed to analyze the p53-mdm <dig> module. in unstressed cells, degradation of p <dig> is rapid, while the degradation of mdm <dig> is slow . it keeps p <dig> at low levels and no oscillation is shown . a super-threshold damage  induces a reduced mdm <dig> dependent degradation of p <dig>  and accelerated mdm <dig> auto-degradation . both parameters  are controlled by activated atm  levels. previous work supports this assumption  <cit> . the dynamics of p <dig> is largely influenced by atm status, while the abrupt onset of activated atm quickly moves the p53-mdm <dig> system from stable steady state to stable limit cycle and draws p <dig> into the oscillatory region . when the level of activated atm decreases, p <dig> level reverts to its original steady state and the oscillation of p <dig> stops. the bifurcation parameter was chosen to be  in consideration of connecting the p53-mdm <dig> module with the upstream atm module. these results suggest that atm activation status can prominently influence on dynamics of the p53-mdm <dig> module.

bax activation module
bistable behavior in bax module was described in our previous works  <cit> . here illustrates the bifurcation diagram . the solid curves indicate stable steady state, while the dashed line characterizes the loci of unstable steady state leading to either low or high steady state on slight perturbations. as described above, the disruption of mitochondria outer membrane is largely attributed to the levels of bax oligomers, and an abrupt upswing of bax oligomers will definitely lead to apoptosis. therefore, the dashed line also defines the threshold stimuli to trigger apoptosis. in the mono-stable region, however, no perturbation has effects on the steady state level of bax oligomers and leads to either monotone survival or death.

the results from individual modules above clearly showed oscillatory or bistable behavior in p <dig> related network. we then investigated the integrated behavior of these modules.

digital or sustained oscillation
we presented the time course evolution of p <dig> in response to distinct external damages. figure  <dig> shows the time series of simulation results about p <dig> and damage levels. p <dig> always remains at the steady state when no stimulus is experienced . note that dna damage we discussed here can be divided into two categories: one is basal dsb  and the other is external dsb. basal level of dsbs indicates that even in non-stressed cells, it definitely exists due to mitosis and/or meiosis although differs in levels and cannot be fully repaired; external dsbs are induced by external stimuli  in stressed cells and can be fully repaired. non-zero irradiation dose elicits a digital oscillatory of p <dig> . during each p <dig> pulse, external dsbs are repaired until they fully drop down . upstream events such as atm activation, mdm <dig> transcription, mdm2-dependent p <dig> degradation and subsequent mdm <dig> destabilization primarily contribute to the rise and fall of p <dig>  which is not described in details.

computational analysis showed that p <dig> oscillates persistently when the system harbors basal levels of unrepaired dsbs . in figure 3d, irradiation induced dsbs are completely repaired  but p <dig> still oscillates. the oscillation evolves with relatively fixed amplitude and period. it possibly implies that there must exist certain mechanism to 'memorize' the effect of initial external damage.

we further investigated the underlying mechanism that discriminates the sustained oscillation from the digital oscillation . the parameter k <dig> donates basal level of dsbs. we set k <dig> =  <dig> which highlights a physiological damage, primarily because even in the absence of external stimuli, there appear to be constant, significant levels of physiological dna damage  <cit> . higher assigned values correspond to pathological circumstances  in our simulations. in physiological conditions , once dsb levels transcend the threshold , atm* dramatically flips from low to high state and rapidly becomes fully activated. as dsb is repaired, the levels of atm* slowly decrease, while an abrupt decline occurs when dsb level falls below the limit point , and then the switch turns off. the duration of high levels of atm*, which is indicative of the duration of damage repair process, determines the duration time that p <dig> spends in the oscillatory region. a longer duration in the oscillatory region corresponds to more dsbs and more p <dig> pulses. this phenomenon finally ensures the digital oscillations in context of different external stimuli. in pathological conditions, however, the atm functionally becomes a one-way switch . an external super-threshold irradiation dose  results in the elevation of atm* level and turns on the switch. once fully activated, atm* never falls down albeit external dsbs are fully repaired . the sustained high levels of atm* 'tell' p <dig> to oscillate permanently and p <dig> accepts that idea with no doubt because it has limited knowledge of what is happening on upstream breaks repair process. this ensures a sustained p <dig> oscillation. similar results also emerged in other cases . experimental results by olivier et al. have proved that some tumor cell lines have defective or relaxed checkpoint control and tolerate unrepaired dna lesions <cit> . overall, these results suggest that a physiologically low level of basal dna damage defines a hysteretic response of atm* and digital oscillations of p <dig>  while in pathological conditions, atm activation becomes a one-way switch and cannot revert to its initial level once activated. these two cases are determined by the basal dsbs. experiments by geva-zatorsky et al. are based on mcf <dig> breast cancer cells and the observation that p <dig> performs sustained oscillation is probably ascribed to the significant levels of basal dna lesions in tumor cell lines <cit> . our assumptions are consistent with experimental results.

bax activation switch: counts and decides
previous work by our group showed that the bax activation switch, which computes multiple apoptotic inputs into an all-or-none fashion corresponds to either survival or death  <cit> . however, what signals register dna damage and then impinge on downstream apoptosis remains unsolved. here we provided a plausible mechanism by our mathematical simulations . on the left panel , a slight irradiation dose triggers one p <dig> pulse and the external dsbs are rapidly repaired. expression level of puma increases as p <dig> becomes activated with a delay, which indicates the time for transcription, translocation and translation. newly produced puma brings perturbation to downstream bax activation switch and a subtle elevation in bax oligomers appears but soon tarnishes. mild perturbation is tolerated, and all components return to their original steady state hours later. a ten-fold irradiation dose  evokes two p <dig> pulses followed by a step-wise raise in puma. the damage is also repaired and bax oligomers eventually revert to the initial steady state . in this case, bax oligomers reach a higher peak value compared with the one under lower irradiation. also, it takes a longer time for bax oligomers to return to resting state. a more severe irradiation  evokes three pulses, and bax oligomers have an abrupt onset and finally jump to a high level . puma undergoes a step-wise upswing during each pulse of p <dig> .

then we further illustrated the underlying counting mechanism . the steady state values of bax were indicated by arrows in figure 2c . dotted blue arrows show directions of evolution. in the first p <dig> pulse, transcription of puma quickly begins. the level of puma rises and falls, which we called it a 'puma boosting'. the 'enabler' puma is sensed by bax activation switch. the new-coming puma perturbs bax activation switch and dissociates 'activator'  from the sequestration of bcl- <dig>  and then these liberated 'activator' directly activate bax. activated bax then oligomerizes and contributes to elevated levels of bax oligomers. when degradation rate of puma overrides the production owing to reduced transcription, the levels of puma decay. puma is then neutralized by newly synthesized bcl- <dig> . in turn bax oligomers decrease due to degradation and oligomers dissociation. the level of bax oligomers is a bit higher  than the original steady state  at the time when a second puma boosting is encountered. bax oligomers is accumulated but still below the threshold  at the end of the second puma boosting. a third p <dig> pulse evokes a third puma boosting and bax oligomers further accumulate to surmount the threshold. once bax oligomers are above the threshold, they will not decrease and stay at the high steady state. bax oligomers disrupt mitochondria outer membrane and unleash cytochrome c, which then leads the activation of caspase- <dig> ensuing apoptosis. thus, the information on dna damage is successfully transferred to the bax activation switch, and the cell death decision has been made irreversibly.

taken together, this model delineated a clear picture from damage sensor to downstream decision making by bax activation switch. in response to irradiation, atm becomes phosphorylated and fully activated. activated atm then phosphorylates multiple substrates to trigger p <dig> pulses. the external dsbs are repaired during each p <dig> pulse until they fall below the threshold. elimination of dsbs quickly shuts down the atm switch and concomitant p <dig> oscillations, thus ensures digital pulses. during each p <dig> pulse, puma accumulates in a step-wise manner. puma perturbs downstream bax activation switch. if the perturbation is strong enough, the threshold level will be overridden with an abrupt onset of bax oligomers which finally contribute to apoptosis. counting finally comes true: one or two pulses lead to survival and three pulses to death . the experimental observations by yu et al. confirmed a direct p53-puma-bax interconnection as puma or bax knockout cells become defective in commitment to apoptosis although p <dig> is transfected  <cit> . a plausible explanation of this experimental results can be derived from our model in which p53-induced puma expression is essential for 'counting' and death decision and cells deficient in either downstream component  cannot get access to apoptosis. in all, our modeling results suggest that the 'bax activation switch' can 'count' the p <dig> pulses through accumulated puma and plays a pivotal role in death decision process.

discussion
the present study gave insight into the oscillatory dynamics of p <dig> and demonstrates that how cells show digital or sustained oscillations in the context of different basal dna damage. we further provided a plausible mechanism about how cells count the p <dig> pulses in dna damage-induced cell death decision.

we incorporated essential aspects of atm activation and p <dig> oscillator modules. simulation results showed that p <dig> oscillates in a digital manner. further computational analysis in mutant phonotype came to a new oscillation pattern. observations by geva-zatorsky et al. indicated that tumor cells, under specific circumstances perform sustained oscillation  <cit> . we obtained insights into this dynamics by assigning k <dig> a larger value  indicative of significant levels of basal unrepaired dna breaks and got an exciting observation that p <dig> shows sustained oscillation with superthreshold stimuli in these cells . in tumor cells, a considerable amount of unrepaired dna breaks was verified  <cit> , and therefore we suggest that higher levels of basal dna breaks in tumor cells would result in sustained oscillation of p <dig>  the discrimination of sustained and digital oscillation patterns can be ascribed to the status of atm switch, some of which define a one-way switch with high levels of basal dna damage . unlike normal cells, tumor cells often show significant activation of atm and atm dependent check point pathways under non-stressed conditions  <cit> . on the other hand, deactivation  of atm is regulated by pp2a, which is an important phosphatase in cells  <cit> . meanwhile, pp2a subunit mutations are found in a broad set of human cancers and most of these mutants are functionally defective  <cit> . other phosphatases also contribute to the inactivation of atm such as pp2c  <cit> . we speculated that many phosphatases can inactivate atm when dna damage repair progresses, but functional mutations of phosphatases ubiquitously found in the tumor cells  might reduce the inactivation efficiency of atm . so even after irradiation induced dna breaks are repaired , the atm switch can not be shut down and preserves highly activated state to ensure undamped pulses of p <dig> in the tumor cells.

subsequent integration of p <dig> oscillator with bax activation switch finally unveiled subtle control in cell death decision that two pulses or less lead to survival and three pulses to death. a key player in the signaling process is puma  which accumulates during each p <dig> pulse, perturbs the bax activation switch and triggers apoptosis if threshold is overridden. transcription of puma definitely provides a genuine gauge for the severity of dna damage levels. with the help of puma , p <dig> can tip the balance between survival and death in a pulse-like manner.

previous mathematical models proposed for p <dig> oscillation mainly concentrated on the reproduction of oscillation, but only a modicum of attention has been paid to the connections between p <dig> and death decision. wee et al. strived for bridging the gap but they mainly referred to akt/pkb pathways  <cit> . zhang et al.  <cit>  shed shimmering light in this field by discriminating p <dig> as three functionally different subpopulations. however the assumption needs further investigation. puszynski et al. introduced a positive feedback between p <dig> and dna breaks via an intermediate apoptotic protein and intended to decipher death decision process  <cit> , but this positive feedback remains obscure. we developed an integrated model with great benefit to a full-scale understanding of the decision-making mechanism. we suggest that the bax activation switch 'counts' p <dig> pulses through puma, and decides whether it be survival or death. p <dig>  together with its transcriptional regime lies in the nexus of the upstream dna damage sensor and the downstream bax activation switch. it is indubitably through the p <dig> pulses that cells 'know' what happens in the nucleus  and 'decides' what to do. also, a paradox stems from the question: why do tumor cells that perform sustained oscillation escape from commitment to death? we proposed that tumor cell lines have defects in apoptosis execution  <cit> , although p <dig> oscillates and puma accumulates. perhaps only in tumor cells but not normal cells can sustained oscillations of p <dig> occur. further experimental verifications are strongly demanded to clarify these modeling-based questions.

in this study of the p <dig> network, there is considerable interest in the dynamics of the system in cell fate decision. so a reduced representation of modules is convenient for analysis. firstly, we took a simplistic representation to reproduce the p <dig> digital pulses. noticeably, other proposed models are also applicable or closer to the exact mechanism for p <dig> oscillation  <cit> . secondly, batchelor et al.  <cit>  discovered a key component wip <dig> in p <dig> signaling which forms a feedback control over upstream atm module. but the experiment was performed in tumor cell lines , where p <dig> displays sustained oscillations. besides they used persistent γ-irradiation experiments but not a pulse of γ-irradiation which was used by geva-zatorsky et al.  <cit> . here we did not take wip <dig> for consideration for two reasons: simplification and reproduction of digital p <dig> pulse . in addition, most parameters that appear in our model derived from qualitative estimation to get the idiosyncrasies of network dynamics because their values are far from assured in experiments. a qualitative model provides insight into how cell behaves the way it does and how that behavior dependents on parameter fluctuations. finally, downstream machineries other than the bax activation switch that fulfill their roles through counting p <dig> pulses cannot be ruled out simply owing to the fact that in some cases puma-/- cells are resistant to stimuli while bax-/- cells are not  <cit> . furthermore, executioner caspase- <dig> is also identified as a transcriptional target of p <dig>  <cit> , establishing a link between p <dig> and caspase apoptotic switch. therefore, we proposed a general mechanism that damage signal is transmitted encoded by p <dig> through whatever transcripts and then downstream machineries, for instance, the bax activation switch, counts and decides.

CONCLUSIONS
despite limitations and assumptions, our model first paves the way to an understanding of the counting mechanism and the role of p <dig> pulses in cell fate decision. our model also bridges the gap between digital oscillation  and sustained oscillation . we hope that an impeccable appreciation of the intricate regulation of p <dig> network will help us to develop beneficial strategies for pharmaceutical and therapeutical purpose in the future.
