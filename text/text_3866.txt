BACKGROUND
the lifespan of caenorhabditis elegans is regulated by multiple signalling pathways that converge on a battery of downstream target genes. among these, insulin/insulin growth factor-1-like  signalling  is currently best understood. activated insulin/igf-1-like receptor encoded by the gene daf- <dig> triggers downstream kinases to phosphorylate a foxo transcription factor encoded by daf- <dig>  phosphorylated daf- <dig> protein is sequestered in the cytoplasm and inactive. reduction of iis in the absence of ligand or via reduction- or loss-of-function mutation in the daf- <dig> gene relocates daf- <dig> to the nucleus and triggers a genetic program for lifespan extension  <cit> .

mutation in daf- <dig> also enhances resistance to oxidative and thermal stress, most likely by activating several superoxide dismutase and heat-inducible genes  <cit> . the concurrent features of longevity and resistance to oxidative stress have been interpreted as supporting the oxidative stress theory of ageing which proposes a central role for oxygen free radicals and derived reactive oxygen species  in causing the ageing process  <cit> . mitochondria convert approximately  <dig> %- <dig> % of the consumed oxygen to superoxide which can further react to generate other ros  <cit> . hence, a widely held view is that ageing initiates in, and spreads from, the mitochondrial compartment  <cit> .

the e <dig> mutant allele of daf- <dig> conveys several other phenotypic traits to the animals, including a slender adult body, reduced brood size, resistance to hypoxia and enhanced autophagy  <cit> . daf- <dig> animals have an altered metabolism that is partly reminiscent of the dauer stage, a developmental stage that does not feed and is adapted for long-term survival. dauers are hypometabolic and rely, in part, on a shift to anaerobic energy metabolism  <cit> . daf- <dig> adult animals consume substantially less food and they dissipate less co <dig> relative to wild-type controls on a per animal base  <cit> , but their mass-specific oxygen consumption rates suggest that they are not hypometabolic  <cit> .

unexpectedly, the latter experiments also demonstrated that daf- <dig> worms dissipate less heat than wild-type animals per mole of oxygen utilized. this difference was manifested by a considerable reduction of the calorimetric to respirometric  ratio, possibly pointing to a higher efficiency of mitochondrial metabolism  of daf- <dig> animals. in order to address the potential link between energy metabolism, ros production and oxidative damage and lifespan, we have examined energy production in intact worms and in isolated mitochondria. we found that the age-dependent decrease of bioenergetic competence is considerably attenuated in daf- <dig> adult animals. we also found that the higher mitochondrial competence was associated with increased ros production, but with little, if any, damage to mitochondrial protein or dna. the low c/r ratio observed in live daf- <dig> worms was not recapitulated in isolated mitochondria, suggesting that other targets of iis act in concert with the mitochondria to control organismal metabolic rate.

RESULTS
iis alters aerobic energy production
we obtained respiration and heat production rates from wild-type  worms, daf- <dig> and daf- <dig> animals. df <dig> is a molecular null allele denoting a large deficiency that deletes nearly the entire daf- <dig> coding region  <cit> . this mutation is expected to suppress all daf- <dig> phenotypes that rely on intact daf- <dig>  respiration declined with age in all three strains. the rate of decrease was smaller in daf- <dig> animals , but overall, respiration rates were grossly similar in all three strains . heat dissipation also decreased with age in n <dig> and daf- <dig> but was markedly lower in daf- <dig> animals . since the c/r ratio provides an indication of catabolic efficiency  <cit> , these results indicate that the efficiency of aerobic energy production is upregulated in daf- <dig> animals during the first 7- <dig> days of their adult lifespan . interestingly, loss of daf- <dig> function also caused lower c/r ratios than wild-type after the third day of adult life. a similar observation was previously reported for the reduction-of-function allele daf- <dig>  <cit> . next we asked if this putative upregulation of catabolic efficiency in daf- <dig> would be observed in the standing levels of adenosine triphosphate  and adenosine diphosphate  and we found that this was indeed the case  . thus, unlike wild-type  and daf- <dig> worms, daf- <dig> animals are able to attenuate the age-specific depletion of the instantly utilizable energy source atp.

the age-specific decrease in energy production is not caused by systematic loss of mitochondrial genome copy number
having established that whole-worm energy production declines dramatically with age, we next asked whether this could be caused by age-related loss of mitochondria. we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  to assay the copies of mtdna in daf- <dig> and wt animals. we quantitated three mitochondrial genes in staged worms from three independent replicate cultures in order to enforce the robustness of the observations. counter to our expectation, we did not detect any age-related changes in mitochondrial dna  content . interestingly, wild-type animals had about double the number of mtdna copies compared to daf- <dig> worms, with p values between strains bordering on significance ; this difference is likely caused by differences in germline proliferation.

the daf- <dig> allele attenuates the age-specific decline in abundance of key mitochondrial proteins
the isolation of mitochondria from nematode tissue requires harsh treatments to break the tough cuticle. if old worms contain more fragile mitochondria, the isolation process might, by itself, yield a larger portion of damaged mitochondria. in order to ascertain that mitochondrial isolation does not lead to disproportionate amounts of damaged organelles with progressing age and strain differences, we compared the activity level of citrate synthase, a key citric acid cycle enzyme of the matrix and the abundance of cytochrome c, an essential component of the electron transport chain which is present in the intermembrane space. we reasoned that, if the relative abundance of these proteins in isolated mitochondria and in whole worm extracts is identical, this would indicate that the preparation procedure caused no harm to the mitochondria or, at least, that possible damage to the mitochondrial inner or outer membrane inflicted by the isolation process was proportionate at all ages.

western blots showed that cytochrome c protein levels declined with age in all three strains and at similar rates in both mitochondrial preparations and whole worm extracts. remarkably, this decline was much slower in the long-lived daf- <dig> indicating that these mutant animals can attenuate age-dependent reduction in cytochrome c content. as this effect was also seen in whole worm extracts, it is not due to higher resilience of the daf- <dig> mitochondrial outer membrane to disruption during isolation . similarly, mitochondrial preparations and whole worm extract yielded identical age-specific activity profiles of citrate synthase. much like cytochrome c content, citrate synthase activity declined more gradually with age in daf- <dig> than in wt and daf- <dig> animals . these results dispel the notion that mitochondrial preparations from wild-type worms might contain a higher proportion of disrupted organelles and concomitant loss of mitochondrial proteins.

other mitochondrial proteins also show alterations with age. we quantified the abundance of the complex i ndufs <dig> subunit, the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit e1α, complex iv subunit i, complex v subunits α and ß and adenine nucleotide transferase on western blots of whole worm extracts. for the complex i ndufs <dig> subunit, pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit e1α, adenine nucleotide transferase and complex v subunit α, a clear decrease in protein content with age was observed in wt worms, whereas only minor decreases were detected in long-lived daf- <dig> animals. for complex v subunit ß, we observed a slight decrease with age in both strains but the daf- <dig> signal was generally higher than that of wt. only complex iv subunit i content did not decrease with increasing age .

the daf- <dig> allele ensures high bioenergetic competence throughout the adult life of the animals
mitochondria can shift between several energetic states depending on the presence of combustible substrate and adp. freshly purified mitochondria lack sufficient amounts of both and consume very little amounts of oxygen, called state  <dig> respiration. the addition of metabolizable substrate  is not helpful as long as there is no adp to unlock complex v and permit protons to flow into the mitochondrial matrix. the addition of sufficient amounts of substrate and adp maximizes proton flow through complex v and, consequently, electron transport and the reduction of oxygen to water at complex iv , coupled to the conversion of adp to atp . when adp is depleted, the mitochondria return to the resting state  <dig> respiration.

we found that increasing age had little, if any, effect on state  <dig> respiration. adp- stimulated oxygen consumption was higher  in daf- <dig> mitochondria . in both n <dig> and daf- <dig>  state  <dig> respiration remained stable  over the entire life time studied , whereas state  <dig> respiration increased with age very gradually . the limitation placed on electron transport by the chemiosmotic gradient, or respiratory control, can be derived from these data. the ratio of substrate driven oxygen consumption in the presence of adp  to that in its absence , or respiratory control ratio  decreased with age in both strains, but faster in n <dig> . the passage of electrons through the proton translocating complexes i, iii and iv is associated with the release of free energy that is recovered when protons flow back inside at complex v and adp is converted to atp. based on the change in free energy under standard conditions, the theoretical ratio of adp molecules that can be phosphorylated per atom oxygen that is reduced to water, or adp/o ratio, is >  <dig>  <cit> , but maximum attainable ratios are less because of various losses in this process and are ~three for oxidation of nadh by complex i. we observed a gradual age-related decline of adp/o in daf- <dig> and a steeper one in n <dig> .

next we measured the rate of atp synthesis by isolated mitochondria of both strains in the presence of non-limiting supply of substrate and adp. the results reflected the adp/o profiles. complex-i-dependent atp synthesis capacity of daf- <dig> mitochondria was hardly affected by the ageing process, whereas a gradual decline was observed for mitochondria prepared from wt animals . similar atp synthesis results were obtained when the mitochondria were fuelled with complex ii substrate .

unlike the live animals, daf- <dig> mitochondria show no dramatic reduction in c/r ratio
a portion of the protons pumped into the intermembrane space by etc complexes i, iii and iv is not used to drive adp phosphorylation by complex v, but leaks back to the matrix and represents a loss of energy as heat. since heat released by live daf- <dig> animals was abnormally low relative to wt worms, we asked whether isolated mitochondria would yield similar results. a disadvantage of our thermal activity monitoring method is that it requires prolonged  temperature equilibration of the samples in the instrument prior to effective data collection . we observed that the oxygen consumption by daf- <dig> mitochondria was reduced by 15% at the end of the experiment compared to the initial respiration rate . remarkably, wt mitochondria lost very little activity under these conditions. to minimize experimental bias, we only used the respiration rates measured after completion of heat measurement to obtain the c/r ratio. mitochondria respiring in state  <dig> fuelled by non-limiting amounts of adp and complex i substrate were used and this experiment was repeated eight times. overall, we found no significant difference in c/r between the mutant and wild-type mitochondria. .

the daf- <dig> allele causes a higher mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced respiratory capacity
we considered the possibility that microcalorimetry of isolated mitochondria lacked the necessary resolving power to detect small differences in mitochondrial heat dissipation. since mitochondrial heat production is inversely proportional with electron transport chain efficiency, we asked if daf- <dig> mitochondria operate at a higher membrane potential. we used the cationic fluorescent dye daspmi to probe ΔΨmit of mitochondria prepared from wild-type and daf- <dig> animals. the positively charged daspmi ion readily penetrates the mitochondria and is distributed between the external space and the matrix compartment in accordance to the nernst equation. the increase of emission of mitochondrial fluorescence is due to enhancement in quantum yield in the more proteinaceous and apolar microenvironment inside the mitochondria and is strictly linear up to ~ <dig> nmol dye/mg mitochondrial protein  <cit> . we compared the fluorescence intensities of daspmi in the activated oxphos state  and after addition of uncoupler  which results in collapse of the membrane potential and equal distribution of the probe inside and outside the mitochondria . the fluorescence intensities of uncoupled wt and daf- <dig> mitochondria were essentially identical  and invariant with age . however, activated daf- <dig> mitochondria emitted more fluorescence than wt mitochondria  and the fluorescence intensities decreased with age in both strains . we conclude that the membrane potential in fast-respiring mitochondria decreases with age and that daf- <dig> mitochondria most likely operate at higher ΔΨmit values. very recently, another study reported, using in vivo monitoring of the carbocyanine dye 'dis-c3' that knock-down of lifespan-limiting genes by mutation or rnai results in a lower ΔΨmit and a drop in the λmax of the emitted fluorescence  <cit> . these observations are difficult to interpret because they are heavily biased by strain-specific differences in feeding rate, and, of consequence, dye accumulation  <cit> . lowered ΔΨmit is also predicted to lower ros production, as opposed to our measurements.

since addition of uncoupler resulted in equal ΔΨmit in both strains, we asked what the consequences of uncoupling would be on mitochondrial oxygen consumption. addition of the uncoupler fccp increased respiration to the level of maximum electron transport system capacity. the uncoupled rates were slightly higher than the respective state  <dig> rates, indicating that the mitochondria from both strains respired close to their maximum capacity. however, both uncoupled and state  <dig> rates were substantially higher for daf- <dig> relative to n <dig> indicating that this capacity is enhanced in daf- <dig> animals .

daf- <dig> mitochondria generate more h2o <dig> in vitro but do not reveal higher oxidative damage accumulation in live worms
in isolated mitochondria, the rate of ros production is dependent on the mitochondrial membrane potential  <cit> . as reported, ΔΨmit of energized mitochondria is higher in daf- <dig> than in the wt; this raises questions about levels of ros production by these mitochondria. we measured h2o <dig> production in the presence of exogenous superoxide dismutase  to guarantee that all superoxide would be converted to h2o <dig>  we found that h2o <dig> formation declined with age in all three strains, and that daf- <dig> mitochondria produced higher amounts at all ages tested , in line with their higher membrane potential. in contrast, wt animals and daf- <dig> mutants produced essentially identical amounts of h2o <dig> during their adult life trajectories .

we asked if this elevated production of ros in vitro would be reflected in enhanced damage to mitochondrial macromolecules in vivo. firstly, we assayed carbonyl groups on western blots of mitochondrial samples. the extent of carbonylation was fairly identical in wild-type worms and daf- <dig> animals during the first week of their adult lives, but mitochondrial protein from old daf- <dig> animals carried substantially less carbonyl load relative to wt worms . no differences were observed in the carbonyl load of mitochondrial protein prepared from wild-type and daf- <dig> animals .

ros can also inflict damage to dna. we monitored the occurrence of mitochondrial deletions with progressing age using long range nested pcr. for this experiment we used the long-lived double mutant strain daf-2; glp- <dig> and daf- <dig> glp- <dig> as a control. the glp- <dig> genetic background was chosen because it is defective in germline development at the restrictive temperature. in total we examined  <dig> daf-2; glp- <dig> worms picked from 3-, 7-, 10-, 14- and 26-day-old adult cohorts, and  <dig> daf- <dig> glp- <dig> worms picked from 3-, 7- and 10-day-old adult cohorts. faint bands representing curtailed fragments were observed incidentally, irrespective of strain or age. however, when the original dna was assayed again these bands disappeared and novel bands incidentally arose, suggesting that these shortened fragments were generated artefactually during pcr amplification. thus we found no evidence for the occurrence of deletions in mtdna linked to strain differences or progressing age .

discussion
aerobic energy production depends on the concerted action of mitochondrial performance and extra-mitochondrial regulation
we have previously noted that daf- <dig> animals consume similar amounts of o <dig> but dissipate substantially less heat than wt animals  <cit> . in the houthoofd et al. study  <cit>  we demonstrated that the mutant alleles daf- <dig> and daf- <dig> did not produce the expected opposite changes in heat production and atp content and that these phenotypes were not fully suppressed in the double mutant. hence, we proposed that two pathways emanate from daf- <dig>  one which is predominant and daf- <dig> independent, whereas the second one requires daf- <dig> activity. our present results agree with these previous findings.

which mechanism could be invoked to explain the uncoupling of respiration and heat dissipation? it has been speculated that a shift to glycolysis and fermentation along with aerobic respiration would generate energy in daf- <dig> adult animals, as is known for the dauer stage  <cit> . if so, this would rather increase the c/r ratio in daf- <dig> mutants since anaerobic metabolism produces heat without consuming oxygen. we assumed that reduction in c/r ratio reflects more efficient energy production since less energy is lost as heat  <cit>  and expected to find enhanced coupling of atp synthesis to the oxidation of nadh and fadh <dig>  however, we could not reproduce the large difference in c/r ratios of live young adult daf- <dig> and wt animals by assaying their isolated mitochondria . also, the largest difference in worm c/r ratio was observed for a cohort of animals up to 7- <dig> days of adulthood, but this pattern was not reproduced by their mitochondrial adp/o ratios. conversely, we found that the adp/o ratios for daf- <dig> mitochondria were generally higher than those obtained for wt worms when older animals were assayed, whereas the difference in worm c/r ratios between both strains faded away at advancing age . we considered the possibility that the daf- <dig> mitochondria might contain more atp synthase inhibitor protein, if <dig>  this protein has the capacity to inhibit the intrinsic f1-atpase activity  <cit> . since futile atp hydrolysis is expected to generate heat, we reasoned that more if <dig> might contribute to the reduced heat production in daf- <dig> animals. mcelwee et al.  <cit>  reported that one of both c. elegans if <dig> encoding genes, mai- <dig> is expressed at a higher level in daf- <dig>  however, mai- <dig> lacks a mitochondrial import signal  casting doubt as to its mitochondrial action. we compared the expression of mai- <dig> and mai- <dig>  in 2- and 8-day-old adults using qpcr and found no difference between the wt and daf- <dig> mutant strains nor between the age classes . thus, it appears that the aberrant c/r ratio of daf- <dig> animals cannot be merely ascribed to an intrinsic property of their mitochondria and extra-mitochondrial regulatory mechanisms must be considered. uncoupling protein - <dig> allows proton movement across the inner mitochondrial membrane and mutant animals lacking ucp- <dig> reportedly contain elevated atp levels and are sensitive to cold stress  <cit> . the ucp- <dig> gene is expressed at equal levels in wild-type and daf- <dig>  <cit> , yet the activity of the protein may be regulated differently in the mutant. another possible regulatory mechanism is futile cycling of fructose-6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase and fructose bisphosphatase resulting in the net hydrolysis of atp and thermogenesis  <cit> . this pathway is active in vertebrate species and has not yet been extensively studied in c. elegans. phosphofructokinase is upregulated in daf- <dig> adult animals and both phosphofructokinase and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase are upregulated in wild-type dauers  <cit> . since dauers and daf- <dig> adults predominantly use fat stores for energy production, these changes most likely indicate that cells expressing glycolytic activity are different from those that are active in gluconeogenesis  <cit> . thermogenesis by cycling of fructose-6-phosphate would involve opposing reactions of phosphofructokinase and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase in the same tissue  <cit> , is more likely under allosteric control and may be reduced in daf- <dig> adults relative to the wt animals.

age-dependent reduction of mitochondrial bioenergetic competence is attenuated in daf- <dig> animals
conceivably, the dramatic reduction of energy production with age could be caused by systematic loss of mitochondria. we tested this hypothesis by assaying the mitochondrial genome content using a quantitative real time pcr approach and found that it was false. next we investigated whether isolated mitochondria show a comparable age-dependent reduction in respiration rate. this was clearly not the case. state  <dig> respiration was essentially unaffected by age in both strains. state  <dig> respiration represents maximum performance under conditions of unlimited fuel supply, non-physiologically high oxygen concentration and absence of any cellular control. these results indicate that the ability of the mitochondria to reduce oxygen is not affected by the ageing process and that the decline of oxygen consumption and heat output by intact animals during the first week of adulthood is regulated by aspects of mitochondrial function not studied here or by extra-mitochondrial control. in contrast, the mitochondrial coupling efficiency, illustrated by the adp/o ratio and atp synthesis under state  <dig> conditions, and the dependence of respiration on the available adp, illustrated by the rcr, declined with age in all three strains though more weakly in daf- <dig> mitochondria. these results suggest that the mitochondrial bioenergetic competence is bound to decline with age but that this decline is attenuated by mutation in daf- <dig>  suggesting modulation by ins/insuline-like growth factor  signalling.

how could the bioenergetic competence of the mitochondria be altered? we found that several components involved in mitochondrial function decreased with age both in n <dig> and daf- <dig> animals though faster in n <dig>  that could explain the higher state  <dig> respiration rates measured for daf- <dig> but not the fairly constant state  <dig> rates measured over the life trajectories. one possible explanation is that the bioenergetic competence is largely dictated by a higher order structure of the etc complexes. bornhövd et al.  <cit>  proposed a model of microdomain organization of oxphos complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane and they argued that disruption of these microdomains would affect metabolite/substrate channelling and/or efficient cooperation of these complexes, ultimately leading to a reduced flux through the respiratory chain and a lower membrane potential.

our measurements of adp/o, rcr, atp synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential in daf- <dig> worms versus wild type mitochondria are consistent with such a model. most interestingly we can now explain the increased ros production that is known to be positively correlated with the mitochondrial membrane potential  <cit> .

mitochondrial ros production does not limit the lifespan of daf-2
although we cannot prove that daf- <dig> mitochondria also generate more ros in vivo, the expectation is that they do so. at first glance, this appears to be at odds with the common belief that a reduction of ros underlies lifespan extension because it is predicted to slow down oxidative damage accrual . however, this mutant does show increased sod and catalase activities and levels of reduced glutathione and resistance to oxidative stress  <cit> . microarray analysis revealed that impairment of daf- <dig> signalling enhanced daf-16-dependent expression of sod- <dig>  hsp- <dig>  gst- <dig>  gst- <dig>  mtl- <dig>  ctl- <dig> and ctl- <dig>  <cit> . conceiveably, the activation of such a generalized defense could be mediated by a process called mitohormesis, where increases in mitochondrial ros production cause an overcompensating induction of the antioxidant machinery resulting in extension of lifespan, as illustrated by schultz et al.  <cit> . however, for antioxidant defense to double lifespan of daf- <dig> relative to wt animals we would expect to detect substantial decreases of oxidative damage relative to wt worms. we did observe lower levels of carbonylated mitochondrial protein, but only in very old animals. also, we could not confirm the expected decrease of mtdna deletion events in the long-lived mutants  <cit> . in fact, we found no evidence of any such deletions in  <dig> long-lived and  <dig> control animals. moreover, deletion of all mitochondrial sod activity by null alleles of both mnsod encoding genes  failed to shorten  <cit>  or even extended  <cit>  lifespan in an otherwise wild-type background and failed to abolish longevity of daf- <dig> animals  <cit> . in all, these and our findings suggest that oxidative damage is not likely a major determinant of the lifespan of c. elegans under normal environmental conditions.

control of mitochondrial atp production
we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  found repeatedly that impairment of iis signalling resulted in much higher standing levels of atp than normal. this finding is most surprising as it seems to violate common biochemical wisdom that 'the activities of the pathways that produce atp are under strict coordinated control so that atp is never produced more rapidly than necessary' . it is not clear which alterations cause this apparent uncoupling in daf- <dig> mutants. the activity of complex v is controlled by the flux of protons and the concentration of adp in the mitoplasm. normally, the concentrations of atp and adp are in equilibrium: synthesis of atp is expected to lower the concentration of adp, in turn lowering the rate of atp synthesis by complex v. also, any decrease of the adp/atp ratio in the cytosol is expected to result in reduced import of adp into the mitoplasm tending to maintain the ratio constant. in daf- <dig> mutants both atp and adp concentrations are elevated , complicating interpretation of their possible role in controlling energy production. another potential site of control is the cytochrome c oxidase  reaction which is irreversible. in mammals, atp is known to bind and inhibit complex iv  <cit>  allosterically, thereby adjusting atp production to energetic demand.  <dig> -diiodothyronine can release the allosteric inhibition of complex iv by atp, allowing high atp production in the presence of high concentrations of atp  <cit> . possibly altered iis signalling in daf- <dig> animals affects an analogous worm control mechanism.

daf- <dig> adult animals do not reiterate the energy metabolism of the dauer stage
daf- <dig> mutant animals inappropriately activate the dauer programme at temperatures  that allow uninterrupted development of wt worms. since dauers can survive several times the normal lifespan and daf- <dig> adults live about twice as long as the wt it is reasonable to expect that they share some common mechanisms for extended lifespan. whole genome transcription profiling identified a cohort of genes that are upregulated in both dauer larvae and daf- <dig> adult animals, including genes involved in certain aspects of metabolism, oxidoreductase activity, small heat shock proteins, anti-ros defense and detoxification systems  <cit> . many of these changes may foster prolonged survival. however, energy metabolism is quite different in dauers and daf- <dig> adult worms as it is downregulated in dauers and normal in daf- <dig> adults. anaerobic fermentation is upregulated and mitochondrial energy production may be partially shifted to anaerobic functioning during dauer diapause, as typically occurs in many parasitic species  <cit> . the low c/r ratio's measured in daf- <dig> adults exclude similar shifts of energy production in these animals.

the daf- <dig> mitochondrial phenotypes are not likely primary mechanisms of daf- <dig> longevity
the mechanism by which the daf- <dig> mutation extends lifespan remains elusive. the metabolic profiles of ageing cohorts of n <dig>  daf- <dig> and daf- <dig> animals are in line with a previous study  <cit>  and, combined, point to a complex regulation of energy metabolism, where two pathways emanate from daf- <dig>  a predominant one that is daf- <dig> independent whereas the other requires daf- <dig>  given the common view that daf- <dig> is a master regulator of longevity, this would implicate that the metabolic changes imparted by daf- <dig> are auxiliary, rather than essential, mechanisms of lifespan extension. this view is strengthened by several observations. we have demonstrated that the fall of metabolic rate with age is attenuated in daf- <dig> animals. yet, while several aspects of daf- <dig> mitochondrial function are higher or better preserved with age, state  <dig> respiration of both wt and daf- <dig> mitochondria shows no such age-specific fall, suggesting that mitochondrial malfunction is unlikely a primary cause of ageing. also, the increased energetic efficiency of daf- <dig> animals inferred from the c/r ratio is not recapitulated in isolated mitochondria suggesting that in control of whole-worm metabolism, extra-mitochondrial regulatory mechanisms are important. the higher standing levels of atp cannot be essential either, because rnai against several mitochondrial genes reportedly lowered atp substantially but extended lifespan  <cit> ; also, the ucp- <dig> mutant  contains elevated atp levels yet is not long-lived  <cit> . the overproduction of antioxidant enzymes by the daf- <dig> mutant will certainly enhance survival under unfavorable conditions that are associated with oxidative stress, but they appear to be hardly effective in extending lifespan under normal conditions, as discussed previously. combined, these observations suggest that low daf- <dig> function alters the overall rate of aging by a yet unidentified mechanism, with an indirect protective effect on mitochondrial function.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented evidence that the age-dependent decrease in abundance and bioenergetic competence is considerably attenuated in mitochondria of the long-lived daf- <dig> mutant animals, and that these changes are associated with a higher membrane potential and increased ros production. we also showed that the ultimate mechanism by which the daf- <dig> mutation extends life span cannot be ascribed to the higher standing levels of atp or reduced oxidative damage. thus, the mechanism by which the e mutation extends life span remains largely enigmatic. it is possible though that the altered function of daf- <dig> mitochondria contributes to shifts in the metabolic network, not detected by the present approach and impinging on longevity assurance mechanisms. it was recently shown that dauer larvae and adult insulin-like signalling  and translation  mutants display a common metabolic signature dominated by shifts in carbohydrate and amino acid signature  <cit> . many of these metabolites are related to the citric acid cycle, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate shunt, metabolic activities that are differently regulated in dauers and daf- <dig> mutant worms. fuchs et al. <cit>  found a general elevation of amino acid pool sizes in both mutant classes, and a striking upregulation of the branched amino acids isoleucine, leucine and valine, possibly resulting from downregulation of breakdown by mitochondrial bckd enzyme complex. the upregulation of gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate shunt and downregulation of amino acids catabolism may serve a longevity assurance mechanism that is based on recycling of cellular components. we assume that dysfunctional mitochondria are more rapidly degraded by autophagic processes in daf- <dig> mutant animals. the higher standing levels of atp and the superior bioenergetic competence of their mitochondria would provide the necessary energy for subsequent mitogenesis ensuring sustained presence of competent mitochondria.
