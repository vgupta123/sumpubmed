BACKGROUND
chronic myelogenous leukemia  is caused by expression of a single oncoprotein resulting from the fusion of the bcr and abl genes  <cit> . the abl protein is a ubiquitously-expressed tyrosine kinase involved in multiple signaling pathways, and the fusion of the bcr protein to the n-terminus of abl in hematopoietic stem cells results in an oncoprotein with unregulated tyrosine kinase activity  <cit> . this causes cell proliferation, ultimately leading to leukemic transformation  <cit> . imatinib  is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine compound  that represents the first in a class of targeted anticancer drugs developed to treat cml through inhibition of bcr-abl  <cit> . due to the large number of kinases in the human genome and the structural conservation of the kinase catalytic domain, targeting specific kinases has been particularly difficult. nevertheless, imatinib is remarkably specific, and is effective against a very limited set of tyrosine kinases, including kit, pdgfr and ddr in addition to abl  <cit> .

a series of biochemical and structural studies have elucidated the mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of abl by imatinib. protein kinases generally adopt similar active conformations, but can differ significantly in their inactive conformations; imatinib inhibits abl specifically by binding to an inactive kinase domain conformation that is characteristic of abl  <cit> . the kit kinase domain also adopts an inactive conformation when bound to imatinib, and this conformation resembles that of abl bound to imatinib  <cit> . kit and pdgfr are now therapeutic targets of imatinib for tumor types in which they are in a deregulated state  <cit> .

imatinib displays excellent efficacy and minimal side effects in clinical studies with cml patients  <cit> , and now represents the frontline therapy for cml  <cit> . however, patients in advanced stages of the disease develop resistance to imatinib treatment, due to the acquisition of mutations in the abl kinase domain that render the protein insensitive to this inhibitor  <cit> . second-generation drugs such as nilotinib  <cit>  and dasatinib  <cit>   have been developed that are able to target most, but not all, imatinib-resistance mutations. currently, third-generation therapeutic agents are in development or clinical evaluation.

a major goal in the further development of kinase inhibitors is to maintain a degree of specificity similar to that of imatinib for abl, thereby minimizing potential side effects from off-target interactions. thus, to identify potential secondary targets of these inhibitors, recent studies have focused on chemical proteomics screens for drug-interactors  <cit> . briefly, the screens involve the generation of matrix-linked inhibitors that are used to pull down interacting proteins, which are then identified by mass spectrometry and validated by binding and activity studies. this approach has been pursued with imatinib and the second-generation inhibitors nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib. in addition to the known targets of these inhibitors, additional kinase targets were identified. for imatinib, the screens also identified a surprising non-kinase target, the oxidoreductase nqo <dig>  which also was shown to be a target of the second-generation inhibitor nilotinib but not dasatinib or bosutinib  <cit> .

nqo <dig> is a cytosolic flavoprotein that carries out the 2-electron reduction of quinones using electron donors such as nicotinamide riboside . it is one of two closely related cellular quinone reductases  and is thought to be involved in metabolic reduction and xenobiotic detoxification  <cit> , although its precise physiological role remains uncertain  <cit> . interestingly, nqo <dig> is highly expressed in myeloid cells, the targets of imatinib in cml anticancer therapy, and rnai knockdown of nqo <dig> in k <dig> cells, an immortalized bcr-abl-positive cml cell line, resulted in reduced proliferation rates  <cit> . the phosphorylation of nqo <dig> on a serine residue in k <dig> cells was observed  <cit> , suggesting potential regulation of the activity of the enzyme by phosphorylation.

imatinib and nilotinib inhibited the nqo2-mediated reduction of the anticancer drug mitomycin c, with ic <dig> values of  <dig> μm for imatinib and  <dig>  μm for nilotinib  <cit> . another set of experiments demonstrated competitive inhibition by imatinib of the nqo2-mediated reduction of menadione  with a ki of  <dig> nm, in line with an ic <dig> value of  <dig> nm obtained by competitive binding assay  <cit> . these data, together with the observation that imatinib levels reach ~ <dig> μm in the serum of patients  <cit> , imply that nqo <dig> inhibition occurs in imatinib-treated cml patients, raising the possibility that nqo <dig> inhibition may contribute to the overall pharmacological effects of these drugs.

the exact mechanism by which nqo <dig> is inhibited by imatinib is unknown. neither chemical proteomics study detected turnover of imatinib by nqo <dig>  one study proposed that imatinib inhibits nqo <dig> activity via competition with the fad cofactor for binding to the enzyme  <cit> , while the other study reported competitive inhibition with respect to the substrate menadione  <cit> .

here, we report studies undertaken to further understand the structural basis for the molecular mechanism by which imatinib binds to and inhibits nqo <dig>  spectroscopic measurements confirmed the direct binding of imatinib to nqo <dig>  with concurrent changes in the flavin environment indicating that the fad is not displaced by imatinib. we have solved the x-ray crystal structure of nqo <dig> bound to imatinib to  <dig>  Å resolution, which shows that the drug is bound adjacent to the flavin isoalloxazine ring. the x-ray structure further provides an explanation for the binding specificity of nqo <dig> for imatinib and nilotinib, as well as for the effects of mutation of the reported phosphorylation sites on nqo <dig> 

RESULTS
inhibition of nqo <dig> by imatinib and nilotinib
to assess the inhibition of nqo <dig> by imatinib, a continuous spectrophotometric assay was used. briefly, the nqo2-mediated reduction of menadione to menadiol is coupled to the reduction of the dye 3-- <dig> -diphenyltetrazolium bromide  by menadiol, resulting in an increase in absorbance at  <dig> nm. nilotinib, dasatinib, and quercetin, a flavonoid nqo <dig> inhibitor that is also a non-specific kinase inhibitor  <cit> , were included for comparison. as shown in figure 1b, imatinib inhibited nqo <dig> activity with an ic <dig> value of  <dig> nm, approaching that observed for quercetin . these values are in the same range as those determined previously  <cit> . nilotinib inhibited nqo <dig> activity with an ic <dig> value of  <dig> nm, while dasatinib did not inhibit nqo <dig> activity significantly at the concentrations tested .

binding of imatinib to nqo2
to investigate the mechanism of inhibition of nqo <dig> by imatinib, we first examined the effect of imatinib binding on the flavin environment using electronic absorption spectroscopy . the absorbance spectrum of the enzyme in the absence of imatinib  is characteristic of an oxidized flavoprotein  <cit> , with absorption bands at  <dig> and  <dig> nm and a shoulder at  <dig> nm. upon addition of imatinib, the absorption bands are perturbed significantly  and the difference spectrum exhibits minima at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm and maxima at  <dig> and  <dig> nm . thus, the flavin is affected appreciably by imatinib binding, but not displaced from the protein, as the observed spectrum in the presence of imatinib is not characteristic of free flavin  <cit> . the results of our spectroscopic investigations are consistent with the notion that imatinib competes with substrate for binding in the active site adjacent to the flavin, as suggested previously  <cit> .

structure of the nqo2-imatinib complex
to determine how imatinib binds to nqo <dig>  we crystallized human nqo <dig> in the presence of imatinib and solved the structure of the complex by molecular replacement using the structure of the ligand-free enzyme . the complex crystallized in space group i <dig>  with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. the crystals diffracted x-rays to a resolution of  <dig>  Å. four n-terminal residues  and one c-terminal residue are disordered. the final model includes residues 3– <dig> of human nqo <dig>  one fad molecule, one imatinib molecule, one zinc atom, two -2-methylpentane- <dig> -diol  molecules, and  <dig> solvent molecules. we use the same residue numbering scheme for the model reported here that is used for all previous structures of nqo <dig>  in which the genetically encoded n-terminal methionine is excluded, so that the second genetically encoded residue, ala  <dig>  is labeled as residue  <dig> in the structure. the refined model has working and free r-values  <cit>  of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively .  <dig> % of observed backbone dihedral angles lie in the favored ramachandran regions, and the remaining  <dig> % lie in allowed ramachandran regions.

biochemical and structural studies have demonstrated that nqo <dig> is a dimer  <cit> . in our structure, the dimer is formed from two adjacent molecules related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis. dimerization leads to formation of two fad-containing active sites per dimer, with each active site located in a deep pocket at the interface between monomers . clear density into which imatinib could easily be built was observed in the electron density maps at the active site after molecular replacement . imatinib interacts with nqo <dig> primarily via hydrophobic interactions, as shown in figure 4a. the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin cofactor forms the floor of the active site, upon which the pyridine and pyrimidine rings  of the bound imatinib stack, with an average distance of ~ <dig>  Å between atoms in closest contact. the side chains of trp  <dig> and phe  <dig> form the back of the active site, while three hydrophobic amino acids from the other monomer in the nqo <dig> dimer, phe  <dig>  ile  <dig>  and phe  <dig>  form the top of the active site .

steric constraints prevent the bound imatinib from binding in an extended conformation, causing it to instead adopt a horseshoe shape that directs the methylbenzene, benzamide, and n-methylpiperazine rings  away from the active site and towards the solvent . the imatinib n-methylpiperazine ring extends into solvent and forms crystal contacts with a third symmetry-related molecule.

the inhibitor makes no direct hydrogen bonds with the protein, although several water-mediated hydrogen bonds are observed. a water-mediated hydrogen bond is formed between asn  <dig>  which is positioned by a hydrogen-bonding interaction with tyr  <dig>  and the n <dig> nitrogen of the imatinib pyridine ring . the n <dig> and n <dig> nitrogen atoms of the imatinib 2-aminopyrimidine moiety  interact with a cluster of ordered waters . a similar water cluster is also observed in several other nqo2-ligand complexes  <cit> , and such water-mediated interactions have been proposed to be important for nqo <dig> ligand recognition  <cit> .

substrates and inhibitors of nqo <dig> contain planar aromatic moieties that insert into the active site and stack on the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin cofactor  <cit>  . for imatinib this role is played by the 4-pyridyl-2-aminopyrimidine moiety . because it is substantially larger than previously characterized nqo <dig> ligands, imatinib forms additional interactions, including hydrophobic interactions between the methylbenzene, benzamide, and n-methylpiperazine rings  and several amino acids surrounding the rim of the active site .

discrimination by nqo <dig> between imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib
the imatinib binding mode we observe in our structure explains why nqo <dig> is inhibited by nilotinib, but not by dasatinib  <cit> . nilotinib contains a 4-pyridyl-2-phenylaminopyrimidine core , identical to that of imatinib, that can adopt a planar conformation and fit in the active site, and a similar amide-linked substituted phenyl ring , which likely also extends towards solvent from the active site. the modest reduction in affinity relative to imatinib may be due to the increased bulk and decreased flexibility of the nilotinib trifluoromethylbenzene and methylimidazole rings  compared to the benzamide and n-methylpiperazine rings of imatinib . the chemical structure of dasatinib contains an aminopyrimidine core similar to that of imatinib and nilotinib , but the adjacent non-aromatic hydroxyethylpiperazine ring  cannot adopt the planar conformation necessary for stacking onto the flavin isoalloxazine ring. dasatinib is unable to adopt a cis conformation  around the bond between the aminopyrimidine and thiazole rings  that is capable of productive interaction with the rim of the active site.

specificity of imatinib for nqo <dig> over nqo1
nqo <dig> is closely related to another quinone reductase, nqo <dig>  despite catalyzing the same reaction, namely, the two-electron reduction of quinones, and sharing 49% identity at the amino acid level  <cit> , nqo <dig> is not inhibited by imatinib  <cit> . a comparison of the structures of human nqo <dig>  <cit>  with the structure of imatinib-bound nqo <dig> described here provides an explanation for this observation. while the structures of nqo <dig> and nqo <dig> superimpose well, with a r. m. s. deviation of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> cα atoms, nqo <dig> lacks a c-terminal domain of  <dig> amino acids. the c-terminal domain of nqo <dig> is involved in binding of the adenosine and diphosphate moieties of the cosubstrate nadh, which is not used by nqo <dig>  <cit> . when the two structures are superimposed, the side chain of phe  <dig> in the c-terminal domain of nqo <dig> occupies the space in which the imatinib n-methylpiperazine ring  is found in the nqo <dig> structure. in addition, the side chains of tyr  <dig> and pro  <dig> at the rim of the nqo <dig> active site occlude the space that is occupied in the nqo <dig> structure by the imatinib benzamide and methylbenzenes rings , respectively, and the side chain hydroxyl group of tyr  <dig> clashes with the imatinib aminopyrimidine ring . thus, steric hindrance by residues in the c-terminal domain unique to nqo <dig>  and by residues in the active site that differ between nqo <dig> and nqo <dig>  prevents imatinib binding in the nqo <dig> active site.

comparison of the imatinib binding modes observed in nqo <dig> and in kinases
in the structures of imatinib bound to its primary pharmacological target abl  <cit> , as well as to several other kinases  <cit> , the inhibitor binds in an extended conformation, with the pyridylpyrimidine moiety  trans to the methylbenzene and benzamide rings  with respect to the c9-n <dig> bond . nilotinib also binds to abl in a similar extended conformation  <cit> . imatinib can also bind in a more compact conformation, with the pyridylpyrimidine moiety cis to the methylbenzene and benzamide rings , as seen in the structure of imatinib bound to syk  <cit>  and in the structure of a desmethyl imatinib analogue bound to src  <cit> . this folded-over conformation is less common, and is likely to correspond to a low-affinity interaction because imatinib has limited efficacy against syk  <cit> . the conformation of the imatinib molecule in complex with nqo <dig> resembles this cis conformation . this may have implications for the design of other pyridylpyrimidine-containing kinase inhibitors and other drugs, which might display unintended interaction with nqo <dig> if they depend on or are capable of adopting a similar cis-like conformation.

nqo <dig> phosphorylation
nqo <dig> is phosphorylated on either ser  <dig> or ser  <dig> in the bcr-abl-positive cell line k <dig>  <cit> . to examine the potential role of this modification in regulation of nqo <dig> activity, we mutated each residue to ala or to phosphoserine-mimicking asp, purified the resulting proteins, and measured their activities. as shown in figure 8a, the s16a, s20a, and s20d mutants exhibited ~70% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme, while the activity of the s16d mutant was reduced to ~10% of wild-type enzyme activity. additionally, the s16d mutant was colorless as purified, as opposed to the yellow color displayed by the other mutants and the wild-type protein, and was found to be a mixture of monomer and dimer by analytical gel filtration .

ser  <dig> and ser  <dig> are both located adjacent to the binding site for the fad cofactor. ser  <dig> is involved in recognition of the fad adenine ring , so mutation at this position might disrupt this interaction and reduce fad binding affinity, resulting in the lower activities of the s20a and s20d mutants . the side chain of ser  <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain amide of gly  <dig> and packs against the imidazole side chain of his  <dig>  keeping the main chain of ser  <dig> from blocking part of the fad adenine binding site. the ser  <dig> hydroxyl group is also close to the diphosphate moiety of the fad  . the s16a mutation might disrupt the hydrogen-bonding and van der waals interactions necessary for proper formation of the adenine binding pocket, resulting in a decrease in fad binding affinity similar to that caused by the ser  <dig> mutations. the pronounced drop in activity of the s16d mutant , as well as the observed loss of yellow color and partial monomerization, suggests loss of the fad cofactor. such cofactor loss might result from repulsion between the phosphate oxygen atoms of the fad diphosphate moiety and the aspartate side chain of the s16d mutant, in addition to disruption of interactions necessary for proper formation of the adenine binding pocket.

what role could phosphorylation of nqo <dig> play in vivo? while the large decrease in the activity of the s16d mutant suggests that phosphorylation of this residue could mediate down-regulation of nqo <dig> activity, the buried nature of the ser  <dig> side chain likely precludes it from being a target for phosphorylation in cells. furthermore, studies have indicated that nqo <dig> is functional in k <dig> cells  <cit>  – the same cells in which nqo <dig> was found to be phosphorylated  <cit> , suggesting that phosphorylation of nqo <dig> is unlikely to be directly inactivating. thus, it is more likely that the solvent-exposed ser  <dig> is the site of nqo <dig> phosphoryation. the relatively minor effect of ser  <dig> mutation on enzyme activity suggests that phosphorylation may regulate some other aspect of nqo <dig> function, rather than by directly affecting enzyme activity. it is worth noting that imatinib, and therefore bcr-abl inhibition, did not alter the phosphorylation of nqo <dig> on ser  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the kinase that phosphorylates nqo <dig> is unlikely to be a direct bcr-abl effector.

CONCLUSIONS
to date, numerous crystal structures of the flavoprotein oxidoreductase nqo <dig> in complex with quinones, natural products, and xenobiotics have been solved  <cit> , and we report here the x-ray crystal structure of nqo <dig> bound to the leukemia drug imatinib, an inhibitor of bcr-abl. our study has been motivated by the possibility that inhibitors of bcr-abl might also interact with unintended targets, and that these interactions may lead to side effects during drug treatment. the data reported in this work elucidate the mechanism of nqo <dig> inhibition by imatinib, and suggest that nqo <dig> is likely to be inhibited by imatinib at the 1-μm serum concentration typical in patients  <cit> . the question remains as to what the physiological consequences of nqo <dig> inhibition by imatinib may be and whether they contribute to the efficacy of imatinib in treatment of cml. while it has been reported that rnai knockdown of nqo <dig> or treatment with the polyphenol nqo <dig> inhibitor resveratrol results in a reduction of proliferation of bcr-abl-positive k <dig> cells  <cit> , we failed to see any effect of nqo <dig> knockdown on k <dig> cell proliferation . on the other hand, nqo <dig> knockout mice exhibit myeloid hyperplasia  <cit>  and increased susceptibility to chemical carcinogenesis  <cit> . although these side effects have not been observed yet in cml patients treated with imatinib  <cit> , future studies on the effects of nqo <dig> inhibition on cellular function and the role of nqo <dig> in cancer initiation and progression may shed light on the possible physiological consequences of nqo <dig> inhibition by imatinib or nilotinib.
