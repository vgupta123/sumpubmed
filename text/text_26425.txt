BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rna gene products of 19– <dig> nucleotides  long, which function to repress the translation or mediate the degradation of their target mrnas. a  <dig> nt mature mirna is derived from a precursor transcript of 60– <dig> nt in length, which is named as pre-mirna. pre-mirnas can potentially fold into a hairpin structure without large internal loops or bulges.

mirnas were found to play diversified roles from species to species  <cit> . in recent years, researches on the roles of mirnas in cancers have been increasing tremendously, and mirnas are suggested to have important therapeutic potential in human diseases. to date, there are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirna entries for the human, mouse and rat genomes deposited in mirbase  <cit> , the home of mirna data on the web, in release  <dig> , respectively. yet some studies suggested that the total number of mirnas existing in a vertebrate genome can reach at least  <dig>  <cit> , therefore continual efforts should be made on locating and verifying the unknown mirnas. a number of computational prediction methods and software tools have been developed over the years for this purpose  <cit> , however the datasets adopted by the various prediction tools are different and older methods are usually outweighed by the newly developed ones in terms of specificity and sensitivity.

in this paper, we first describe and validate the clustering phenomenon of mirnas in the human, mouse and rat genomes by computational means. we then develop a clustering-based approach to a selected software tool, promirii-g  <cit> , which was launched in  <dig>  aiming to filter their false positive mirna predictions.

RESULTS
mirna clustering
many mirnas are found to be arranged in clusters  <cit> , meaning that they are in close proximity with their neighboring mirnas. mirnas located in the same cluster are usually co-regulated and co-expressed  <cit> , and recent studies suggest that mirna clusters play important biological roles in specific tissues or genomes. examples include cell proliferation in human lung cancer tissues  <cit> , latent and lytic replication of kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus  <cit> , testis development and spermatogenesis in primates  <cit> .

in view of this, we believe that mirna clustering can be used to assist the prediction of novel mirnas, and here we analyze how this idea can be applied computationally.

analysis of mirna clustering in the human, mouse and rat genomes
the definition of a mirna cluster varies among researchers. altuvia and colleagues defines a cluster in which there are two or more mirna genes with pairwise chromosomal distances of at most  <dig> nt  <cit> . weber  <cit>  suggested the following criteria of a cluster: same orientation and not separated by a transcription unit or a mirna in the opposite orientation. a microarray study reveals that an abrupt transition in the correlation between pairs of expressed mirnas occurs at a distance of  <dig> kb, implying that mirnas separated by less than  <dig> kb typically derive from a common transcript  <cit> . in many other studies, the term 'cluster' is used without a proper and clear definition  <cit> , and is also used to describe the phylogenetic relationships of mirnas  <cit> . to assess the clustering property of mirnas in the human, mouse and rat genomes, we want to have our own definition of a mirna cluster. we define that two mirnas belong to the same cluster if  they are located on the same strand of the same chromosome, i.e. same orientation; and  they are separated by a chromosomal distance of not more than  <dig> nt. this distance of  <dig> nt is not arbitrary. we first choose six different distances, which are  <dig> nt,  <dig> nt,  <dig> nt,  <dig> nt,  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt, and then we test the effect of the distances on the number of clusters and the number of clustered mirnas formed. as shown in table  <dig>  there is an abrupt increase in the number of clustered mirnas from the case of  <dig> nt to the case of  <dig> nt. there are little effects on the number of clustered mirnas and the number of clusters defined when the separation is more than  <dig> nt. to conclude, among the six distances that we have tested,  <dig> nt is an optimal chromosomal distance bound within which two clustered mirnas are separated. figure  <dig> illustrates our definition of a mirna cluster and table  <dig> summarizes our results of the mirna clustering analyses. the human and mouse datasets used in this paper were downloaded from release  <dig>  of mirbase and the rat datasets were from release  <dig> . there are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total mirnas that are clustered in the human, mouse and rat genomes, respectively.

                              chromosomal distance at which two clustered mirnas are separated
"average cluster size" is equivalently to the average number of mirnas found in a single cluster. it can be seen that there is an abrupt increase in the number of clustered mirnas from the case of  <dig> nt to the case of  <dig> nt. there are little effects on the number of clustered mirnas and the number of clusters defined when the separation is more than  <dig> nt. to conclude, among the six distances that we have tested,  <dig> nt is an optimal chromosomal distance bound within which two clustered mirnas are separated.

"version of mirbase" denotes the update version of mirbase where the datasets are downloaded. "size of clusters" is equivalently to the number of mirnas found in a single cluster. there are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clusters identified in the three genomes respectively, which are equivalent to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total human, mouse and rat mirnas.

similarity analyses among clustered mirnas, non-clustered mirnas, neighboring sequences of clustered mirnas and random sequences
as there are nearly half of the total mirnas organized in clusters, we are interested in testing whether there are any relationships or similarities among them. we assess the sequence and secondary structure similarities among mirnas in the same cluster by aligning the precursors of each clustered mirna with the sequences from the following four categories in a pairwise manner:

 its fellow mirnas found in the same cluster;

 mirnas located outside its cluster;

 random sequences extracted from the genome; and

 neighboring sequences extracted from its flanking  <dig> nt regions.

the software t-coffee  <cit>   is used for pairwise sequence alignment. the program rnadistance of the vienna rna package  <cit>   is used to compute the distance between two mirna secondary structures, which are determined by rnafold. figure  <dig> shows how a clustered mirna is aligned to sequences of the four categories.

as shown in table  <dig>  there is no statistically significant difference among the sequence alignment scores of the four categories , suggesting that sequence similarity is unlikely to be useful for identifying clustered mirnas. interestingly, the distance between the secondary structures of mirnas located in the same cluster is found to be much smaller than the distance obtained by comparing the structures of clustered mirnas with the sequences from the other three categories . in other words, clustered mirnas are structurally more similar to one another, and the rnadistance score can be used to assess the structural similarity between two sequences. based on this observation, we propose a clustering-based approach to improve the effectiveness of computational prediction of mirnas.

sequence and secondary structural alignments are performed for each clustered mirna with sequences from the following categories:  clustered mirnas,  non-clustered mirnas,  random and  neighboring sequences. a higher score implies a greater distance and hence a higher degree of dissimilarity. std dev, standard deviation.

performance analyses of promirii-g and mir-abela
we select two software tools to test our proposed clustering-based approach, namely promirii-g  <cit>  and mir-abela  <cit> . in terms of positive predictive value  and sensitivity , we first analyze the performances of these two prediction tools, and the results serve as a benchmark for comparison with our approach. both promirii-g and mir-abela allow users to set a prediction threshold. using a relaxed threshold, more true positives  and predictions will be obtained, yet at the same time a large number of false positives  will be included. in other words, a high se and a low ppv are expected. our approach aims at increasing the ppv by filtering as many as fps as possible with the application of mirna clustering.

it should be noted that in the mouse genome,  <dig> of the pre-mirnas are duplicated. in other words, only  <dig> mouse pre-mirnas are distinct in the genome. to avoid overestimation of the performance of the software, we identify the duplicated ones and conduct two measurements. #, number; fp, false positives; tp, true positives; se, sensitivity; ppv, positive predictive value.

application of mirna clustering: a clustering-based approach
recalling that clustered mirnas are more structurally similar to one another as determined by the rnadistance scores, we therefore design a clustering-based approach which utilizes this observation to filter false positives. the detailed steps of our approach are described in the section of methods under the sub-title of "our clustering-based approach" and figure  <dig> provides the overview of the approach.

from table  <dig>  it is clear that our approach is able to increase the ppv to a large extent, from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. at the same time, it retains most tps with just a slight drop of less than 10% in se when it is applied to the human and the mouse genome. the approach appears to sacrifice the se for the increase in ppv when it is tested on the rat genome. since our filtering approach is based on mirna clustering, it works best when the cluster has more than one tp. table  <dig> shows a more suitable comparison when the clusters with less than two tps are excluded from our test. the increase in ppv outweighs the drop in se in all the three cases, suggesting that our approach is effective in filtering fps without losing too many tps.

this table shows the se and ppv obtained after our filtering approach is applied to the predicted candidates generated by promirii-g. the ppv is increased by more than 15% in all the three genomes. the se is kept reasonably high as it is just slightly decreased by a percentage less than 10% in the human and mouse genomes.

if we exclude the clusters which bear no tps or just one tp among the candidates predicted by promirii-g, we can see a great improvement in ppv without a significant effect on se after our filtering approach is applied. the results agree with the principle of our approach, which is developed based on the phenomenon of mirna clustering. in other words, if there are no clustered mirnas in a sequence, our approach is not going to work properly. this table presents the results of a fairer comparison, suggesting that our approach is effective in filtering fps.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we first validate the phenomenon of mirna clustering in the human, mouse and rat genomes and confirm that there are more than 45% of the mirnas in these genomes which can form clusters. we demonstrate that the secondary structure of a clustered pre-mirna is more similar to its neighbouring pre-mirnas located in the same cluster, when compared to the sequences outside clusters. using this property, we design a clustering-based approach to filter the fps resulting from a mirna prediction software named promirii-g and successfully raise the ppv by a considerable amount ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the human, mouse and rat genomes. at the same time, the approach is able to retain a reasonably high se. in view of this, we conclude that our approach is shown to be effective in raising the ppv of a software tool, particularly in the human genomes. we believe that it is worthwhile to carry out further experiments and tests with our approach using data from other genomes and other prediction software tools. better results may be achieved with fine-tuning of parameters.
