BACKGROUND
heart defects account for nearly one-third of all major congenital anomalies diagnosed in fetuses and infants  <cit> , but the etiologies of heart anomalies are largely unknown. most heart anomalies are suspected of being etiologically and pathogeneticly heterogeneous  <cit> . conotruncal defects are a group of defects which result from abnormal aortico-pulmonary septation of the outflow tract of the heart, a process that has been shown to have a major mesectodermal cell contribution  <cit> . despite this understanding of the pathogenesis of conotruncal defects, little is actually known about the etiology of these heart defects.

shaw and co-workers  <cit>  observed a 30% risk reduction for conotruncal defects among the offspring of women who used multivitamins containing folic acid in early pregnancy. the risk reduction for the group was driven by a larger risk reduction for the tetralogy of fallot. early studies found that folate deficiency during gestation were associated with multiple congenital abnormalities in rats, including those heart anomalies similar to conotruncal defects  <cit> . additional evidence in support of the protective effect of folic acid comes from reports of an association between maternal anticonvulsant use and heart defects  <cit> . most of the frontline anticonvulsants are known to be folate antagonists  <cit> , and reduction in the bioavailability of folate to the fetus has been proposed as one of their potential underlying teratogenic mechanisms of action  <cit> .

several lines of evidence support an association between maternal use of folic acid in early pregnancy and a reduced risk for delivering offspring with conotruncal defects. however, the underlying process by which folic acid facilitates a reduction in risk is unknown and remains an area of considerable scientific speculation. given the overall evidence that has emerged from the studies of a closely related set of congenital defects, the induction of conotruncal defects also is unlikely to be explained by a simple maternal vitamin deficiency. the evidence accumulated in recent years suggested that elevated homocysteine  levels may be a major teratogenic mechanism underlying folic acid deficiency  <cit> . we hypothesize that a fetal deficiency in transport and/or metabolism of folate puts fetuses at risk for conotruncal defects, and that maternal folic acid supplementation helps overcome this deficiency. these defects are hypothesized to be the result of a direct effect of folate insufficiency on the growth and differentiation of embryonic cells. in addition, neural crest cells that contribute to conotruncal septation are rapidly dividing cells that require adequate intracellular folate supply that can best be facilitated by a well-regulated folate uptake pathway. we recently characterized the cardiovascular defects in folr <dig> knockout mouse model  <cit> . cardiac outflow tract defects, including double outflow right ventricle , rightward persistent truncus arteriosus  and transposition of great arteries  have been observed in pre-term nullizygotes rescued from lethality by low dose maternal folate supplementation. we also observed aortic arch arteries defects such as right aorta arch, aorta ring/double aorta and interrupted aorta arch in these fetuses  <cit> .

we hypothesized that folr <dig> gene ablation will alter the expression of other genes which may be important for normal cardiovascular development. these gene expression changes may affect biological functions of the developing heart, and ultimately result in one of several defects we observed in folr <dig> mutant mice. in order to investigate the mechanisms of cardiovascular abnormalities induced by knocking out folr <dig> gene, we designed experiments in which folr <dig> heterozygous female were crossed to folr <dig> nullizygous male mice. pregnant dams were given low dose of s-folinic acid in order to rescue the nullizygote's embryonic lethality. we subsequently collected heart and conotruncal tissues, extracted total rna and studied gene expression within isolated regions of the target tissues. we investigated the gene expression changes induced by conventional folr <dig> gene ablation in the cardiac tissue in order to discover patterns that might shed light on the mechanisms of how folr <dig> gene and folate status regulate early cardiac development.

RESULTS
embryos collected from s-folinic acid supplemented dams 
the average somite number of nullizygous embryos collected at e <dig>  was  <dig>  . their heterozygous littermates developed faster and had an average somite number of  <dig>  . average somite numbers for embryos collected at e <dig>  were  <dig>   for the nullizygous and  <dig>   for the heterozygous embryos. the somite number differences between mutants and heterozygotes at these two time points were statistically significant ; therefore we were unable to obtain somite matched littermate controls. in order to match somites, we decided to collect heterozygous embryos at earlier time points . heterozygous embryos averaged  <dig>   somites at e <dig> , and  <dig>   somites at e <dig> , which matched the nullizygous embryos collected at e <dig>  and e <dig> , respectively. knockout embryos collected at e <dig>  also showed developmental delay; however, the somite number did not differ significantly from their heterozygous littermates  and we managed to collect comparable null and heterozygous embryos .

microarray data
microarray analyses were performed as preliminary screening for candidate genes. the original data from this study have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  under geo series accession no. gse <dig>  at the  <dig> somite stage, out of approximately  <dig>  genes,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated in cardiac tissue. among these genes, six of the down-regulated genes and five of the up-regulated genes are unknown. at the  <dig> somite stage,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated in cardiac tissue, with  <dig> being functionally unknown. at the  <dig> somite stage, out of approximately  <dig>  genes,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> genes were up-regulated in the conotruncal tissue, with  <dig> of them being functionally unknown. analysis indicated that the cck gene, encoding cholecystokinin, was down-regulated  <dig>  fold in cardiac tissue from a  <dig> somite fetus, and decreased still further  in tissue from older  fetuses. this is the only gene showing differential expression in multiple time points. we further conducted gene ontology  analysis with the use of gotm  <cit> . the go analysis produced clusters of statistically  enriched differentially expressed genes according to their ontology in three categories: biological processes, cellular component and molecular function. the ontology groups enriched at each developmental stage are shown in table  <dig> 

quantitative real-time pcr 
we performed quantitative rt-pcr using taqman gene expression assays  on eight candidate genes suggested by the preliminary microarray data. the candidate genes we studied included mylpf, cck, cfl <dig> and nkd <dig> , cck and hand <dig> , fbln <dig>  capns <dig> and canx genes . tables  <dig> summarized the comparison of gene expression data obtained from quantitative rt-pcr and microarray. for each gene tested, the qrt-pcr result is consistent with the microarray result; mylpf, cck, cfl <dig> and fbln <dig> were down-regulated, while nkd <dig>  hand <dig>  capns <dig> and canx were up-regulated in nullizygous tissue samples compared to control samples. the fold changes obtained from microarray data was also comparable to those from qrt-pcr assays. however, qrt-pcr changes in nkd <dig> and fbln <dig> were not statistically significant . we subsequently expanded the analysis of cfl <dig>  cck and hand <dig> genes to all three stages. qrt-pcr results showed that cfl <dig> was only down-regulated in 14-somite stage  but not in 28-somite heart or 38-somite conotruncal tissue . cck was about  <dig> fold down-regulated  in 14-somite heart,  <dig>  fold down-regulated in 28-somite heart , and  <dig>  fold down-regulated in 38-somite conotruncal tissue, however the change is not statistically significant  . hand <dig> is unchanged at 14-somite stage,  <dig> fold up-regulated in 28-somite stage  heart, but down-regulated in 38-somite conotruncal tissue, however, the change is not statistically significant .

discussion
our study was designed to investigate differentially expressed genes related to the heart and conotruncal phenotypes in response to conventional knockout of mouse folr <dig> gene. we used "het ♀ × null ♂" matings to generate heterozygous and nullizygous progeny. it has been established that folr <dig> heterozygotes do not exhibit any morphological phenotypes, although their biochemical status may differ from wild type due to the loss of one folr <dig> allele  <cit> . the nullizygous males used in the mating were born from colonies maintained on a high folate diet, therefore these mutant animals were completely rescued from folr <dig> ablation related morphological phenotypes. the heterozygous embryos served as controls in the micorarray studies under the same maternal supplementation regime as the nullizygotes. embryos used for study were matched by somite number which represents gross developmental progress. we chose not to use littermate matches, since the nullizygotes under the folate supplementation regime we used were significantly delayed compared to heterozygous littermates .

early embryonic heart development  undergoes a series of highly complex, coordinated and rapid morphogenesis processes. in folr <dig> mutant embryos provided in utero with low dose of maternal folate supplementation , abnormal heart looping including inverted looping, midline looping, and shorterned outflow tract was observed as early as e <dig>  in previous experiments. abnormal looping in these animals contributes to the mis-alignment of outflow tract and some phenotypes seen in the pre-term human fetuses. our experiments took snap shots of the gene expression patterns at two different stages  in heart tissues, and later in more restricted conotruncal tissues . the data suggests that changes in gene expression are responsible, at least in part, for the observed cardiac malformations.

it is generally hypothesized that multiple genes and pathways are responsible for complex birth defects. gene expression alterations in the embryonic tissues ultimately contributed to these malformations. our study produced lists of up and down regulated genes, and these genes were classified by their gene ontologies. go analysis of our microarray data highlighted several ontology groups which were most significantly enriched in folr <dig> mutant heart and conotruncal tissues . we further investigated eight candidate genes selected based on the microarray data.

embryonic heart development is an extremely complex process requiring highly organized and coordinated cell movement. the actin cytoskeleton is intimately involved in regulating cell motility, membrane trafficking, cell polarity and signal transduction. during early heart development in folr <dig> mutant embryos, the expression of a number of structural cytoskeleton genes were altered. these included actb, encoding the "house-keeping" cytoplasmic beta-actin , arpc <dig>  encoding actin related protein 2/ <dig> complex subunit  <dig>  and actl7a, encoding actin-like 7a . mylpf , was found to be down-regulated in 14-somite tubular heart tissue. mylpf expression in tubular heart exhibits a gradient, while in later stages, mylpf is expressed at high levels in the outflow tract, atria, and inflow tract  <cit> . cholecystokinin, encoded by cck, is known as a brain/gut peptide, whose functional roles remain unclear. there is evidence showing that cck may involve in development of neurons  <cit>  by modulating cell migration. we observed down regulation of cck in both 14-somite and 28-somite hearts. further investigation of cck and cardiac development is warranted.

actin-based movement results from rapid turnover of active filaments which requires arp2/ <dig> complex, actin depolymerizing factor and capping proteins  <cit> . cfl <dig>  encoding non-muscle cofilin , was down-regulated in 14-somite heart tissue. n-cofilin is an actin-depolymerizing factor and is essential for cytokinesis, endocytosis, and in the development of all embryonic tissues. cfl <dig> knockout mice exhibit failure of neural tube closure at e <dig>  and die in utero. in these embryos, the delamination and migration of neural crest cell is inefficient. in vitro migration assay showed no signs of cell polarization, limited traveling distance and lack of f-actin structures   <cit> . reduced cfl <dig> expression, together with later reduced expression of actb and arpc <dig> in folr <dig> mutant heart tissues could contribute to abnormal actin dynamic, cell polarity and cell migration in these embryos.

the expression changes in the aforementioned cytoskeletal related genes in cardiac tissues of folr <dig> knockout mice during different stages of cardiac development support the hypothesis of possible impairment of cytoskeletal structure and cell motility of neural crest, myocardial and endocardial cells. another study found that genes involved in the semaphorin/plexin signaling pathway which regulates cofilin and actin cytoskeleton  <cit>  were differentially expressed in e <dig>  heart tissue from folr <dig> knockout mice . such altered gene expression may subsequently contribute to the ultimate cardiac phenotypes observed in the mutant mice.

calpain is a ca2+-regulated cytosolic cysteine protease that exists in two major isoforms and mediates crucial cellular functions including rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins and protein cleavage to activate various receptors and pro-enzymes. calpain protein consist of a large activity subunit and a small regulatory subunit. calpain dysregulation results in a loss of ca2+ homeostasis and intracellular calpain activation, leading to degradation of a large family of calpain-specific substrates and physiologically induces tissue damage. cellular proteins including cytoskeletal proteins, membrane receptors  and g proteins), signaling molecules -trisphosphate kinase), and transcriptional factors  have all been identified as potential calpain substrates  <cit> . calpain related pathology seems to be of enormous diversity  <cit> . calpain is known to modulate actin cytoskeleton and cell migration by regulating activities of signaling molecules including integrin, focal adhesion kinase, talin, protein kinase c and the rho family of gtpase  <cit> . the capns <dig> gene encodes the small subunit of μ- and m-calpains, which is known to be essential for embryonic development  <cit> . genetic ablation of the calpain small subunit exhibited abnormal neural crest cell migration  <cit> . we observed a significant increase in capns <dig> expression in folr <dig> mutant conotruncal tissues at the 38-somite stage. at this stage, the outflow tract is being remodeled to form endocardium cushions and develop into the aorta and pulmonary artery. the observed up-regulation of capns <dig> suggests a possible dysregulation of calpain activity and the loss of ca2+ homeostasis. it remains unclear which genes are serving as down-stream targets of calpain in our mouse model. it is also possible that an increase of the small subunit is actually a feedback response to intracellular oxidative stress caused by the folr <dig> gene ablation and/or folate deficiency.

cell-cell interaction is a fundamental process required for mammalian development. cells interact with each other through cell adhesion. cadherins are a group of cell adhesion proteins that mediate ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion. the functional significance of these proteins during embryogenesis has been previously revealed  <cit> . the members of the cadherin superfamily  are characterized by their unique extracellular domains composed of multiple cadherin repeats. classical cadherins, such as epithelial  or neuronal  cadherin, link to the cytoskeleton to establish strong adhesion. this is mediated by binding of the conserved cytoplamic tail to β-catenin. the cadherin-β-catenin complex then binds to α-catenin which bridges the complex to the actin cytoskeleton via actin-binding proteins such as α-actinin or profilin  <cit> . interestingly, β-catenin is also a key player in the canonical wnt signaling pathway, suggesting important interrelations between wnt signaling and cadherin-mediated adhesion  <cit> .

wnts are a group of important extracellular glycoproteins. wnt signaling plays critical roles in many biological processes such as regulation of cell adhesion, cell proliferation, differentiation and transcription of target genes. recent studies from different species suggested wnt signaling is also involved in cardiac development  <cit> . wnt <dig> is a key regulator of cardiac muscle cell proliferation and differentiation during heart development  <cit> . canonical wnt signaling is required for proper cardiac differentiation  <cit>  and neural crest cell induction, while non-canonical wnt pathways  are essential for neural crest migration  <cit> . nkd <dig>  naked cuticle  <dig> homolog , encodes nkd <dig>  which is a calcium binding protein known to bind an important signaling molecule, dishevelled, and antagonizes both canonical wnt signaling and pcp pathway  <cit> . during mouse embryo development, nkd <dig> and nkd <dig> are expressed in multiple tissues in partially overlapping, gradient-like pattern, some of which correlate with known patterns of wnt activity. increased nkd <dig> expression in 14-somite folr <dig> mutant heart tissues may inhibit wnt-dishevelled signaling pathways in these embryos and contribute to abnormal cardiac development at this stage.

canx  was up-regulated in 38-somite conotruncal tissues). the calnexin protein is an important component of the calreticulin/calnexin cycle and the quality control pathways in the er. disruption of this cycle may cause impaired cardiac development  <cit> . these may reflect complex changes of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction which affect cell behaviors such as polarity and motility. other genes related to cell adhesion and ecm found to be differentially expressed in folr <dig> mutant heart and conotruncal tissues included fbln <dig> , aplp <dig> , bbp , cldn <dig> , nr2f <dig>  and col4a3bp .

the bhlh transcription factor, hand <dig>  plays an important role in cardiac morphogenesis. hand <dig> has been identified a crucial cardiac regulatory protein that controls the balance between proliferation and differentiation in the developing heart  <cit> . hand <dig> protein acts as cell-specific developmental co-activators of the mef <dig> family of transcription factors  <cit> . we observed an increase of hand <dig> expression in 28-somite heart, suggesting possible involvement of hand <dig> in cardiac phenotype in folr-/- mice. in 38-somite conotruncal tissue, however, hand <dig> was down-regulated. further investigation is needed to characterize the expression of hand <dig> in folr-/- embryos.

our microarra data also showed that a group of genes involved in oxidoreductive reactions were changed in folr <dig> mutants. these included: peroxiredoxin , glutathione s-transferase, mu <dig> , coproporphyrinogen oxidase , phosphogluconate dehydrogenase , atpase, h+ transporting, v <dig> subunit , lactate dehydrogenase  <dig>  b chain , acetyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase, long-chain , ribosomal protein l <dig> , cytochrome p <dig>  family  <dig>  subfamily b, polypeptide  <dig> , and serine/threonine kinase  <dig> interacting protein .

oxidative stress is involved in the etiology of a spectrum of diseases including those of the cardiovascular diseases, birth defects, immune diseases, and cancer. increased generation of ros or impaired ros scavenging function also play a central role in a variety of teratogenic processes, such as maternal diabetes/obesity, environmental  and drug-induced teratogenesis  <cit> . folr <dig> knockout mice are likely to suffer from oxidative stress secondary to disturbed folate homeostasis. changes of genes involved in the generation of ros and/or rns and antioxidant defense machinery observed in this study provided supportive evidence to the hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes significantly to abnormal cardiovascular development and myocardial function under a rather complicated mechanism.

even though the gene ontology analysis of microarray data is limited to current literature and knowledge, it provided important clues for generation of new testable hypotheses. further studies focused on pathway-specific gene expression, proteomic and functional validation of candidate genes, as well as interactions among responsive genes and pathways, are currently underway in our laboratory.

the exploratory nature and small sample size  of the microarray study resulted in limited power of statistical tests, which may subsequently cause excessive false negative results. control of false discovery rate  has become popular in microarray data analysis  <cit> . for our study specifically, however, fdr correction does not help to identify differentially expressed genes . we therefore used combined criteria to select candidate genes for further study: 1) at least  <dig>  fold changes in gene expression; 2) t-test p-value <  <dig> ; 3) average intensity above background signal plus four standard deviations. this criterion is suitable for using microarray data as preliminary screening. selected genes were further investigated using standard quantitative real-time pcr technology.

CONCLUSIONS
the results suggested that folr <dig> gene ablation and abnormal folate homeostasis altered gene expression in developing heart and conotruncal tissues. these changes affected normal cytoskeleton structures, cell migration and motility as well as cellular redox status, which contributed to cardiovascular abnormalities in mouse embryos lacking folr <dig> gene activity.
