BACKGROUND
one of the basic physiological functions of the resident microbiota is that it functions as a microbial barrier against pathogens  <cit> . a healthy, balanced microbiota has been suggested to be predominantly saccharolytic, with significant numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli  <cit> . the use of pre- and probiotics has thus been suggested as approaches to prevent salmonella infections and infections by enteric pathogens in general  <cit> .

prebiotics were originally defined as "non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon, and thus improve host health"  <cit> . the main candidates that meet the required criteria for classification of a food ingredient as a prebiotic are fructo-oligosaccharides, including inulin, galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose  <cit> . numerous studies have shown that prebiotics stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in vivo  <cit>  and specific strains from these genera have been shown to suppress bacterial infections including those caused by ingestion of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium   <cit> . mechanisms proposed to explain the enhanced resistance to pathogens induced by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria include  competitive inhibition of the epithelial and mucosal adherence of pathogens,  production of antimicrobial substances,  immune modulation, and  production of short chain fatty acids which can reduce the growth of acid-sensitive pathogens like salmonella  <cit> .

salmonella infections are a global problem with salmonella enterica serovar typhi  and serovar paratyphi  causing epidemics of severe systemic infections in developing countries  <cit> . s. typhi and s. paratyphi do not cause systemic infections in other mammalian hosts than humans, but the balb/c mouse model used in the present study provides a murine model of human typhoid fever  <cit> . in the eu, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis  and s. typhimurium are the most frequently reported serovars causing human salmonellosis. a total number of  <dig>  cases of human salmonellosis were reported in the eu in  <dig>  <cit> .

despite the promising effects of probiotics on the prevention of salmonella infections in mice  <cit> , studies with prebiotics have shown conflicting results. inulin has been found to reduce the mortality of mice challenged with s. typhimurium  <cit>  and in rats fed an inulin-oligofructose diet, numbers of s. typhimurium in the content of ileum and caecum were reduced  <cit> . additionally, increased resistance to s. typhimurium infection in mice was reported with combined administration of bifidobacteria and galacto-oligosaccharides  <cit> . finally, a recent study showed that oral administration of galacto-oligosaccharides to mice immediately prior to s. typhimurium sl <dig> infection reduced the clinical signs of infection, significantly reduced the organ counts of s. typhimurium, and reduced the pathology associated with murine salmonellosis  <cit> . in contrast to these findings, a number of papers reporting an increased translocation of s. enteritidis in rats fed inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides or lactulose have been published by one group of investigators  <cit> . however, these studies were all based on low calcium-diets and the adverse effect could be reversed by oral administration of calcium  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to examine if mouse susceptibility to s. typhimurium sl <dig> infection was affected by ingestion of carbohydrates with different structures and digestibility profiles. effects of diets containing inulin, fructo-oligosaccharide , xylo-oligosaccharide , galacto-oligosaccharide , apple pectin, polydextrose or beta-glucan on murine s. typhimurium infection were compared to a cornstarch-based control diet. this is, to our knowledge, the first study comparing the effects of non-digestible carbohydrates with different structures on salmonella infection.

RESULTS
body weight and euthanisation
to monitor the effect of feeding with different potentially prebiotic carbohydrates on the susceptibility to infection with s. typhimurium, groups of mice were fed with diets containing either of the seven abovementioned carbohydrates for three weeks prior to challenge with salmonella.

during the three weeks of feeding on the experimental diets, no significant differences in mean body weights were recorded between the dietary groups. following the salmonella challenge, the mice were monitored and euthanized before schedule in case of adverse signs of infection due to ethical considerations.

only mice euthanised as scheduled on day  <dig> were included in the analysis. these constituted five mice in the group fed polydextrose, six mice in the groups fed apple pectin, beta-glucan and gos, seven mice in the groups fed xos and control diet , and all mice in the remaining groups .

caecum weight and ph
the weight of caecum was significantly increased in mice fed diets containing fos , xos  or polydextrose  when compared to groups fed the control diet . polydextrose ingestion was found to decrease  the caecal ph .

avalues represent means ± sem. bgroup size on day  <dig> post challenge. one mouse died during the acclimatisation period in the control group in study a. **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> .

salmonella cultivated from faecal samples and distal part of ileum
there was a trend , though not statistically significant, indicating that faecal counts of s. typhimurium cultivated from faecal samples were higher on day  <dig> after challenge in the groups fed fos  and xos  when compared to the group fed the control diet. . in mice fed apple pectin, faecal counts of s. typhimurium were significantly higher on day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  . the increased faecal counts in the apple pectin group corresponded to a significantly higher number of s. typhimurium in the content of the distal part of ileum at euthanisation on day  <dig> . also in the fos and xos group, there was a trend that ileal salmonella counts were elevated , though this was not statistically significant .

feeding with beta-glucan and gos did not significantly affect the ileal and fecal numbers of salmonella when compared to the control .

salmonella cultivated from liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes
numbers of s. typhimurium cultivated from the liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were significantly higher in mice fed fos  or xos  with an increase in the mean cfu counts of approximately  <dig>  to <dig>  logs . in animals fed with apple pectin, a similar trend showing increased counts of salmonella in liver  and spleen  was observed.

feeding with beta-glucan and gos did not significantly affect the numbers of salmonella in the investigated organs when compared to the control .

serum levels of haptoglobin
in all dietary groups the concentration of serum haptoglobin was markedly and significantly elevated by salmonella challenge . the mean haptoglobin concentration was between  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml for all groups before infection. by contrast infection caused haptoglobin concentrations to rise to between approximately  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml at day  <dig> post infection, which was a significant  increase for all infected groups with the exception of the control group in study c, where only a trend was observed .

avalues represent means ± sem. bnumbers of mice where serum haptoglobin was measured in uninfected and infected mice. *significantly different from the corresponding concentration measured in uninfected mice. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> . +significantly different from the concentration measured in infected mice fed the control diet. +p <  <dig> ; ++p <  <dig> .

when comparing infected groups fed putative prebiotics with infected control groups, it was seen that for mice fed fos and xos, serum haptoglobin concentrations were significantly higher, p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  respectively, when compared to the control group. in the other parts of the study, it was also seen that prebiotic groups generally did not cause a lower and in most cases caused a higher haptoglobin concentration after infection compared to the control group, with the notable exception of gos where the trend was a lower level.

cellular composition of the spleen of mice from study c
to further explore the action of the immune system on salmonella infection in study c, the composition of immune cells  within the spleen of non-infected as well as infected mice was analysed by flow cytometry. no significant effects of the different prebiotic feeds were demonstrated, however, a significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils  within the spleen of infected mice was found, compared to non-infected controls . this increase positively correlated with the numbers of s. typhimurium cultivated five days post challenge from liver , spleen  and mesenteric lymph nodes  , but not from ileum . furthermore, a positive correlation between the percentages of cd4+ t cells within the spleen of infected mice and the numbers of s. typhimurium cultivated from liver , spleen  and mesenteric lymph nodes  five days post challenge was established , although the increase in cd4+ t cells in infected mice was not significant.

in vitro fermentation study
by in vitro fermentation using monocultures of s. typhimurium, this strain was seen to utilise fos , beta-glucan  and gos , but not xos, inulin, apple pectin or polydextrose. in accordance with these results, a lowering of the culture ph was seen after fermentation with fos , beta-glucan , and gos . a significant decrease in the ph was also recorded in the culture with polydextrose  even though this carbohydrate was not found to support growth of the salmonella strain .

discussion
in the present study we report for the first time that changes in the carbohydrate composition of the diet impair the resistance of balb/c mice to severe s. typhimurium sl <dig> challenge. mice fed with a diet containing 10% fos or xos had significantly higher numbers of s. typhimurium in liver , spleen  and mesenteric lymph nodes  when compared to mice fed with the control diet. additionally, a similar trend was observed for the mice fed with apple pectin, which also had elevated numbers of salmonella in liver  and spleen .

the haptoglobin concentrations seen in the infected mice quite closely correlated with the degree of translocation of salmonella, scored as the numbers of cfu of salmonella in liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes in the dietary groups of each of the three experiments. thus in study a, the significantly increased number of salmonella in the organs of the fos and xos groups compared to the group fed the control diet  correlated with haptoglobin concentrations that were significantly increased in the same groups compared to the control group . in study b and c, no statistically significant differences after infection were detected in either haptoglobin concentration or organ counts between the dietary groups and the control group of each experiments. still, there was a trend for correlation between high haptoglobin concentrations and high organ counts, as seen for example for the apple pectin group of study c  while low haptoglobin levels correlated with low organ counts as observed for the gos group in study b.

to further explore the mechanism behind the increase in haptoglobin concentration observed post challenge with salmonella in study a and b, in study c we included flow cytometric analysis of the cellular composition of the spleen. of all the cell subsets analysed, only the proportions of neutrophils were significantly increased upon infection. we also found a positive correlation between the number of neutrophils in the spleen and the cfu of salmonella in the organs of the infected mice, but not the cfu of salmonella in the ileum, indicating that the neutrophil number and thus the haptoglobin concentration reflects an immune response towards the bacteria translocated to the organs rather than the salmonella present in the gastrointestinal tract. this is in accordance with earlier findings demonstrating that neutrophils are important for host survival during the primary response to salmonella infection, primarily due to control of bacterial replication  <cit> . other investigators have reported changes in other cell subsets in the spleen post infection, e.g. a decrease in t, nk and nkt cells  <cit> , but although there was a positive correlation between organ cfu and t cell numbers, we did not find other significant changes in the cell numbers of the different cell populations analysed.

studies reporting adverse effects of fos and inulin on s. enteritidis infections in rats have been published  <cit> . in these studies it is hypothesised that the increased translocation of s. enteritidis, measured as increased urinary excretion of nitrates and nitrites, is caused by fermentation of the prebiotics producing high concentrations of lactic acid and short chain fatty acids. this was found to impair the mucosal barrier, measured as faecal mucin excretion  <cit> . however, the studies were all based on low calcium diets  and the adverse effect could be reversed by oral administration of calcium  <cit> . acidification of the gut content has been shown to be counteracted by dietary calcium, suggesting that the increased translocation could be connected to low ph  <cit> . however, the diets used in our study contained the amount of calcium recommended for rodents   <cit> , and our results thus contradict that the observed increased translocation occurs only when the diet is low in calcium. additionally, our results contradict that acidification per se should mediate the increased translocation, since no drop in cecal ph was observed in animals fed with fos or xos in the present study .

the major effects of prebiotic fermentation are typically seen in the large intestine, however according to the refined definition of prebiotics  <cit> , as well to the results presented here, the effects are not restricted to the colon. salmonella translocates primarily through m cells located in the ileal peyer's patches  <cit> , and an increased concentration would be likely to result in an increased number of phagocytosed s. typhimurium. however, even though the trends in our data indicated that a high ileal content of the pathogen was accompanied by a high amount of salmonella in internal organs , it should be noted that consumption fos and xos, leading to significantly increased amounts of salmonella in liver and spleen was not accompanied by significantly increased ileal counts of the pathogen , and that apple pectin, which significantly increased ileal salmonella counts did not lead to significantly increased numbers of this pathogen in the internal organs .

with the notable exception of gos, our data suggest that small-molecule prebiotics increase salmonella translocation more than larger molecules . ten bruggencate et al.  <cit>  studied the effect of fos and inulin on s. enteritidis infection in rats and reported an increase in s. enteritidis translocation in rats fed a low calcium diet with fos as well as with inulin. however, in the present study, no increased translocation of s. typhimurium was observed in mice fed inulin . we speculate that the effect of prebiotics on bacterial translocation may be different in rats and mice, and may also depend on the salmonella serovar used, and on other dietary or environmental factors than calcium.

a recent study demonstrated that oral administration of a mixture of gos can reduce numbers of s. typhimurium sl <dig> in the liver and spleen of balb/c mice when given just prior to infection  <cit> . this is in contradiction to the results reported in the present paper, which show no protective effect of gos against salmonella . the differences may be explained by the fact that oral delivery of gos  was given to mice just  <dig> minutes prior to salmonella challenge  <cit> , as opposed to the approach chosen in the present study, which was designed to mimic how continuous ingestion of non-digestible carbohydrates  affects susceptibility to infection.

our findings of increased caecum weight  in mice fed fos, xos or polydextrose indicate increased fermentation in caecum. however, the increase was only accompanied by a decline in caecal ph in the group fed polydextrose. in accordance with our findings, polydextrose has been reported to increase the weight of caecal dry matter, to decrease caecal ph and to change the composition of the caecal microbial community in rats  <cit> . similar changes have been reported for fos and xos in rats with increased numbers of caecal bifidobacteria  <cit> .

our in vitro fermentation experiment showed that s. typhimurium sl <dig> is capable of fermenting fos, beta-glucan, gos and glucose with a corresponding decline in ph. polydextrose was not found to support growth of the salmonella strain, but a significant reduction in ph was recorded, indicating metabolic activity. in accordance with our observation, ten bruggencate et al.  <dig>  <cit>  stated that salmonella can use fos as a substrate for growth. additionally, fooks & gibson  <cit>  reported growth of s. enteritidis on inulin, fos and xos, however generally with a lower specific growth rate than selected probiotic strains. in co-culture with probiotics growth of the salmonella strains was significantly reduced by fos and xos.

the results obtained from the in vitro studies did not explain our in vivo observations. while e.g. apple pectin was not fermented by salmonella in vitro, highly increased levels of ileal s. typhimurium was observed in animals fed with this carbohydrate . this may reflect the growth of salmonella on by-products from fermentation of apple pectin or xos by other gut bacteria. additionally, in vivo, salmonella competes for nutrients with the resident microbiota, of which some bacteria may be more efficient in fermenting the various carbohydrate sources than what we see for salmonella in vitro. factors such as the chain length, branching, and the type of bond linking the monomers, in view of specific enzymes required for fermentation, are likely to contribute to the in vivo competition. our results thus further highlight that laboratory monocultures are not adequate for prediction of bacterial growth  in the complex intestinal ecosystem.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the results presented within this study we conclude that changes in the carbohydrate composition of diets fed to mice alter the resistance to s. typhimurium infections. this raises important doubts about the potential use of certain prebiotics for prevention of salmonella infections. however, it should be kept in mind that our observations do not contradict the proposed beneficial effects of prebiotics in prevention of life-style related diseases such as colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disease, which are likely to be affected by completely different mechanisms than those important for protection against pathogens.
