BACKGROUND
in mammalian pregnancy the interaction between the maternal uterine tissues and foetal trophoblasts is regulated by a wide variety of cellular and endocrinological mechanisms. these mechanisms underpin trophoblastic invasion and remodelling of maternal tissues, placental angiogenesis, and the modulation of maternal immune responses. central to these processes is the production by trophoblast of a variety of hormones that are found in abundance in the maternal bloodstream during pregnancy  <cit> .

the pregnancy-specific glycoproteins  are the most abundant foetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream in late pregnancy  <cit> . they are synthesised in the syncytiotrophoblast of the human placenta and giant cells and spongiotrophoblast in the rodent placenta  <cit> . the psg family of glycoproteins belongs to the carcinoembryonic antigen  family, which also includes the cea-related adhesion molecules . the cea family is itself part of the immunoglobulin  superfamily  <cit> . the ig domain structure of the human and rodent psgs differs. containing both v-like ig domains , c2-like ig domains  and relatively hydrophilic tails , domain arrangements in human psgs are type i , type iia , type iib , type iii  and type iv   <cit> . in contrast, rodent psgs are typically comprised of  <dig>  and in a few cases of  <dig> or  <dig> n-domains followed by an a-domain  <cit> . in the primate / rodent ancestor, the initial duplication of the ceacam / psg primordial gene has been estimated to have occurred about  <dig> myr ago  <cit> , approximately at the time of human-rodent divergence. the most probable psg ancestor in rodents and primates is a ceacam15-like molecule based on the organisation of n and a domains. ceacam <dig> is not classified as a psg because comparisons of n and a domain sequence identity clearly delineate members of the ceacam and psg subfamilies . it has been suggested that human and rodent psg multigene families evolved independently via further gene duplication and exon shuffling events  <cit> .

there are  <dig> members of the psg family in humans that are encoded by genes clustered on chromosome 19q <dig>   <cit> . psg proteins have a similar domain structure to the ceacams, but lack a membrane anchor and are therefore secreted. however, a few variants have been described that are retained within the cell. conversely, a small number of human and mouse ceacam variants lack a membrane anchor and are secreted. membrane-anchored ceacams are widely expressed during embryonic development and in adult tissues, and are implicated in carcinogenesis, angiogenesis and regulation of immune functions  <cit> . in contrast, psgs and some ceacams are expressed almost exclusively in trophoblasts of the haemochorial placenta of rodents and primates  <cit> .

the biochemical properties and physiological functions of the psgs remain to be fully elucidated, although functional experiments and clinical observations are beginning to provide some clues. low psg levels in the maternal circulation are associated with threatened abortions, intrauterine growth retardation and foetal hypoxia  <cit> . the importance of psgs for the maintenance of pregnancy is also underlined by the observation that the application of anti-psg antibodies or vaccination with psg induces abortion in mice and monkeys, respectively, and reduces the fertility of non-pregnant monkeys  <cit> . the majority of psg functional studies have focussed on determining whether psgs are able to modulate the maternal immune system to prevent rejection of the allotypic foetus. early studies with complex psg mixtures isolated from placenta indicated an inhibitory effect on phytohaemagglutinin or allogeneically stimulated lymphocytes  <cit> . in further experiments it was shown that human monocytes secreted anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to psg exposure. moreover, recombinant mouse psg <dig> was found to induce the production of interleukin - <dig> in the mouse macrophage cell line raw  <dig>   <cit> . human psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig> all induced secretion of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and transforming growth factor -β <dig>  <cit> . whilst il- <dig> and tgf-β <dig> are anti-inflammatory  <cit> , il- <dig> is usually considered to be a proinflammatory cytokine. however il- <dig> does have some well-described anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . furthermore, il- <dig> has been shown to indirectly promote trophoblast growth by upregulation of human chorionic gonadotropin  release by the trophoblast, and induction of granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor   <cit> . further evidence implicating psgs in immune modulation arises from psg mediated suppression of t cells in purulent septic complications of abortion  <cit>  and elevated circulating psg levels are correlated with improved symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . psg induction of alternative monocyte activation is of particular importance as it implies a psg-mediated switching of the immune system from a predominantly th <dig> response to a predominately th <dig> response which is more compatible with a successful pregnancy  <cit> .

the only psg receptor identified to date is the integrin-associated cd <dig> receptor, which was found to bind the n <dig> domain of both psg <dig>  <cit>  and psg <dig> . additionally, the presence of the conserved tripeptide motif arg-gly-asp  on a solvent-exposed loop in the n-terminal ig domain in the majority of human and some lower-primate psgs implicates a function that involves integrin-related receptors  <cit> . thus it has been speculated that the rgd domain may enable some psgs to disrupt cell-matrix interactions  <cit> . however, no rodent psg isolated to date possesses an rgd domain. evidence supporting the hypothesis that the rgd domain may be involved in receptor binding was provided by the discovery that a peptide containing the rgd motif, from human psg <dig>  bound to a receptor on the surface of a promonocytic cell line  <cit> . in common with integrin interactions, this was dependent on the presence of divalent cations and showed sensitivity to cytoskeletal signalling. however, the expected sizes of the receptor subunits differed from those of known integrins, therefore, the identity of the receptor remains elusive.

much current work has focussed on human psgs due to their possible relevance to disorders of pregnancy. however, the study of rodent psgs is important because, the evident differences between primate and rodent psg protein domain structures notwithstanding, there appears to be considerable conservation in terms of expression in trophoblast, independent gene family expansions in mammalian lineages with haemochorial placentation, and postulated immune functions during pregnancy. moreover, the application of gene targeting and mutagenesis in the mouse is likely to be informative with respect to elucidating the cellular and physiological functions of psgs. such experiments will require an accurate genomic map of the mouse psg locus, which we undertook to produce in the work described herein. it is also pertinent to ask whether the independent expansions of psg gene families in different mammalian lineages reflect selection for increased gene dosage or for diversification of function mediated through different protein structures or developmental expression patterns. we therefore undertook to examine and correlate protein domain evolution and expression profiles of the various mouse psg genes to attempt to address this question. our results suggest that different family members have very different expression levels at different stages of development, which we consider may be supportive of the hypothesis that mouse psg genes may have evolved divergent functions in mammalian pregnancy. however, mutagenesis of individual family members will be necessary to rigorously test this hypothesis.

RESULTS
identification of novel mouse psg genes
for comparative studies of the human psg family it is relatively easy to compare coding sequences  and peptide sequences because complete sequence information is available. however the data available for mouse psgs is not complete, making such analyses difficult. thus, we firstly collated the currently available public data, and we then attempted to identify sequences for psgs that were not completely resolved in the databases. full-length cdna sequences of psg <dig>  psg <dig>  psg <dig>  psg <dig>  psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig> were identified via basic name searches of the refseq rna database. their identity was then verified by comparison to cdna fragment sequences, which were obtained during the course of this work and deposited in genbank  <cit> , as misnaming of genes is commonplace in the databases. the cdna sequence of psg <dig> was then identified via blast analysis of the mouse refseq rna database using the genbank partial sequence referenced in beauchemin et al.  <cit> . psg <dig> was identified by blast analysis of the same database using the full-length psg <dig> sequence and found to be the xm_ <dig>  predicted transcript. however, there was a discrepancy between the predicted transcript and the sequences of est clones ck <dig> and cn <dig>  comparison of these est sequences with genomic contig nt_ <dig> , using pairwise blast analysis, revealed that there had been a duplication of the n <dig> domain exon. we refer to the two n <dig> domains of psg <dig> as n <dig> and n1* hereafter.

the gene and full-length cdna coding sequences of the remaining mouse genes  were deduced manually by systematic blast analysis of the mouse genome database as described in methods. none of these predicted cdnas were observed in the mouse est database, although all except psg <dig> were observed in the trace archive est sequences. a novel splice variant of psg <dig> was also found. blast analysis of the mouse high throughput genomic sequences  database identified contig ac <dig> , which appears to contain the whole psg <dig> gene. an alternative exon  <dig> was discovered upstream of the previously described initiating exon by a pairwise blast comparison of this contig with full-length psg <dig> coding sequence. the use of this alternative exon  <dig> produced a transcript that encodes a typical psg polypeptide complete with a predicted secretory-peptide signal sequence and cleavage site. multiple hits identified from subsequent blast analysis of the mouse est and trace archives est databases provided evidence that this novel splice variant was placentally expressed in vivo. in contrast, only one hit was obtained by identical analysis using the coding sequence of the brain-specific transcript described in chen et al.  <cit> . this transcript  was derived from a retinal cdna library. the brain-expressed splice variant is generated from an alternative initiation site within exon  <dig> of the dominant placentally-expressed form of the gene. alternative promoter usage would explain the brain and placenta-specific expression patterns of these variants of psg <dig>  unlike the brain-specific variant, the placentally-expressed variant possesses a predicted secretory signal peptide at the n-terminus, like most other psg gene family members.

the comparison of the brain derived psg <dig> coding sequence with the genomic sequence  also revealed differences in the encoding of the a-domain. the placental transcript is predicted to be encoded by  <dig> exons, as are the majority of mouse psg mrnas. however, a weak splice donor signal sequence within the fifth exon permits splicing to a strong splice acceptor sequence downstream of the sixth exon, as seen in the brain-expressed transcript. trace archive est data reveals multiple hits to sequences from placental cdna libraries using the 3' end of the placental psg <dig> coding sequence as bait. this confirms the existence of our predicted transcript. conversely, similar analysis using the brain-expressed variant yielded no hits. the sixth exon is present on a separate randomly ordered gene fragment within the ac <dig>  contig.

psg-ps <dig> was previously considered to be a pseudogene, based on a point deletion at nucleotide position  <dig>  downstream from the canonical psg translational start site  <cit> . however, despite this frame shift, the open reading frame of this unusual psg continues  <dig> bp upstream of the site of the mutation to an alternative atg. inspection of the sequence revealed a kozak consensus, and blast analysis of the public est and trace archive est databases yielded many mrna clones that contain this region in addition to downstream exons. hence, this gene is clearly expressed, and we now propose to rename psg-ps <dig> as psg <dig> hereafter. we note that this mutation and amino terminal extension abolishes the canonical psg secretory signal and peptide cleavage site. we therefore suggest that if psg <dig> is indeed translated, the resulting protein is retained within the cytoplasm. to determine if the deletion observed in balb/c mice was also present in other murine strains, we amplified and sequenced a  <dig> bp fragment by pcr using a set of primers specific for the 5'-untranslated region and the leader peptide of psg <dig>  the deletion observed in the psg <dig> cdna is also present in the genomic dna of a/j, c57bl6/j, ybr/ei, and swr/j inbred mouse strains .

domain structure of mouse psg proteins
a schematic representation of the mouse psg domain structures is shown in fig.  <dig>  of the seventeen mouse psgs, thirteen encode a common structure of three ig variable -like domains  and a single ig constant -like domain . psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig> have an expanded structure created by the duplication of igv-like domains. an unrooted phylogenetic tree indicates three main branches of igv-like domain evolution . there is a group consisting of n <dig> domains, a group of n <dig> domains and n2-derived domains, and a group of n <dig> domains and n3-derived domains. therefore, in agreement with the most common structure observed in fig.  <dig>  the ancestral mouse psg would be expected to have had an n1-n2-n3-a arrangement of domains. the expansion of psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig> has occurred mostly through duplications of the n <dig> and n <dig> igv-like domains, with the exception of psg <dig> n <dig> and psg <dig> n <dig> domains.

in order to characterise the evolution of the mouse psgs with expanded domain numbers, neighbor-joining  trees with bootstrap values of  <dig> were prepared  and clustalw amino acid sequence alignments  were studied to identify the origin of the novel igv-like domains in these three exceptional psgs. from examination of the data in fig. 3a it was not apparent from which progenitor domain the psg <dig> n <dig> domain evolved due to lack of confidence in the branch on which it lies. however, using the alignment identities in fig. 3b it can be seen that, although generally poorly conserved, the best match of  <dig> % was obtained by alignment with the n <dig> domain. therefore, our evolutionary model assumes that the psg <dig> n <dig> domain arose from an early duplication of the n <dig> domain. also, based on agreement of the data in fig. 3a and 3b, the n <dig> domain duplicated again more recently to yield the n <dig> domain. this latter duplication explains why the psg <dig> n <dig> domain is n3-like. the order of these events is shown schematically in fig. 3c.

using a similar analysis we propose a model for the expansion of domains within psg <dig> and psg <dig> ). we suggest that the n <dig> and n <dig> domains of psg <dig> and psg <dig> are derived from a progenitor n <dig> domain. similarly, the n <dig> and n <dig> domains are derived from a progenitor n <dig> domain. expansion is predicted to have occurred in  <dig> or  <dig> separate events in a common ancestor of psg <dig> and psg <dig>  in the first instance the progenitor n3-like and n2-like domains were duplicated, either at different points in evolution or at the same time. the final step was a duplication of both of these daughter domains to create psg <dig> and the precursor of psg <dig>  the precursor of psg <dig> then underwent another duplication, this time of the n <dig> domain.

expression of psg genes in mouse placenta at different developmental stages
on the basis that all mouse psg genes originated from a common ancestor, and expanded into a multigene family by duplication and subsequent divergence, the question as to whether the expression patterns have also diversified is relevant to determining the selective forces underlying psg gene family expansion. as psg genes are expressed predominantly in the placenta, cdna was prepared from total rna extracted from mouse placenta at four stages of development between e <dig>  and e <dig> . psg cdna sequences were then amplified with pcr primers designed to amplify psg <dig> – psg <dig> inclusive. size fractionation of pcr products on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, indicates that mouse psg genes are predominantly expressed from around e <dig> , increasing in expression through to at least e <dig>  . however, after blotting the products onto nylon membranes and hybridising radiolabelled oligonucleotide probes specific for individual psg genes , we observed significant differences in expression profiles of different genes during development. this method is probably semi-quantitative at best but does give some indication of relative expression levels. we observed that psg <dig> and psg <dig> are weakly expressed at e <dig>  but strongly expressed at e <dig> . in contrast, psg <dig>  psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig> are expressed strongly at e <dig> , further increasing by e <dig> . psg <dig> shows a similar expression pattern to these four psgs, but at a relatively low level. very weak expression was observed on e <dig>  for psg <dig>  psg <dig>  psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig>  whereas psg <dig> and psg <dig> were undetectable. psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig> domain structures had not been finalised and therefore their expression was not analysed in this experiment.

a standard iub/iupac nucleic acid codes codes have been used to indicate degeneracy where: r = g/a; y = t/c; k = g/t; m = a/c; s = g/c; w = a/t; b = g/t/c; d = g/a/t; h = a/c/t; v = g/c/a; n = a/c/g/t.

to supplement the pcr-based psg expression studies, we performed 'virtual northern' analysis in silico by screening the public est database for sequences matching psg n <dig> or a-domains and counting the numbers of matches . there was generally good concordance of the virtual data with the rt-pcr data; notably, psg <dig> and psg <dig> are highly represented in both datasets. however, disagreements were also evident e.g. psg <dig> expression was low in the rt-pcr data, but high in the virtual data. a random sample of twenty of the large number of psg <dig> est sequences in the database indicated that all were of placental origin, ruling out contamination with brain-derived sequences as an explanation for the disparity between rt-pcr and virtual analysis. there was also generally good agreement with the results from screening the est database with n <dig> and a domain sequences, although the numbers of a-domain hits were 4– <dig> fold lower than the n1-domain hits. the only exception to this observation was that psg <dig> and psg <dig> sequences were identified in 2-fold greater abundance when screened with the a domain compared with the n <dig> domain. despite some discrepancies, therefore, the combined rt-pcr and virtual northern data demonstrate that developmental onset of expression, and maximum expression levels, vary considerably within the psg family.

mouse psg locus genomic organisation
the published mouse psg gene locus is contained on contig nt_ <dig>  however, the complement of psg genes is incomplete and the majority of gene sequences within the contig are unordered. we therefore decided to determine the organisation of psg genes within the locus by screening bac, yac and cosmid clones using hybridisation with gene-specific oligonucleotide probes. we defined two separate contigs  within which the order of psg genes was determined to the fullest extent possible. the orientation of the two subclusters with respect to each other and the chromosome  <dig> centromere was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridisation  analysis. these data are summarised in fig.  <dig>  all of the known mouse psg genes are located within cytobands a <dig> and a <dig> on proximal chromosome  <dig> and are interspersed with other genes, particularly ceacams, as determined by comparison with the published mouse genomic sequence on contig nt_ <dig>  we did not observe any obvious correlation between the relative positions of the psg genes at the locus and their domain arrangements or expression patterns.

there is a discrepancy with respect to the distance between the two subclusters. the currently poorly resolved data covering this region in the the ensembl assembly implies the presence of a gap between psg <dig> and psg <dig>  however, we determined that the subclusters are fused between psg <dig> and psg30/psg <dig>  yac f <dig>  is about  <dig> kb long and contains only two psg genes which indicates the presence of a non-psg genomic region. we estimate the gap between the subclusters to be approximately  <dig> kb based on the size of cosmids containing two psg genes .

discussion
the human psg genomic data in the public databases are relatively complete. for each psg gene, there are annotated refseq resources comprising information on genomic structure, transcripts and translation products. the nomenclature is also standardised  <cit> . further, there are accurate chromosome  <dig> locus assignments allowing complete visualisation of the psg locus and surrounding genes. in contrast, a substantial quantity of mouse psg genomic data in the public domain is fragmented, incomplete and somewhat unreliable. we sought to collate the existing genomic data, to present novel data to fill in gaps, and to provide a coherent resource of mouse psg genomic data.

to determine whether the existing set of mouse psg genes was complete we performed systematic blast searches of a variety of public dna sequence databases. this analysis revealed the existence of a novel expressed psg gene, which we name psg <dig> in line with the accepted nomenclature convention  <cit> . psg <dig> apparently evolved from a duplication of the whole of the psg <dig> gene followed by a subsequent internal duplication of the n <dig> domain. we were also able to predict the complete coding sequences of four psg genes for which previously only partial fragments were described. the gene, cds and protein sequences of these predictions, coupled with a complete reference of all known mouse psg cds and primary protein sequences are provided in three attached additional files.

using the full cds information obtained for the complete set of mouse psg gene sequences, domain structures for all family members were predicted. all of the psg proteins possess previously described arrangements of ig-like domains. except for two members, discussed below, all are predicted to encode n-terminal secretory signal sequences. our predicted novel splice variant of psg <dig> has a complete n <dig> domain and secretory signal peptide sequence. trace archive est database blast analysis confirmed that this variant is expressed in the placenta. in contrast, the brain-expressed variant  <cit>  has only a partial n <dig> domain and no secretory signal peptide. the previously described psg-ps <dig> pseudogene  <cit>  was found to be expressed in the placenta using trace archive est database blast analysis and possesses an excellent kozak sequence at the predicted translational initiation site. this evidence therefore indicates that this gene, which we rename psg <dig>  is not a pseudogene but a bona fide expressed psg gene family member. the psg <dig> transcript may encode a protein that is retained within the cytoplasm. we note that a precedent in the human exists in the form of a non-secreted splice variant of psg <dig>  <cit> .

psg <dig> has the unusual n1-n1*-n2-n3-n4-n5-n6-n7-a domain structure. this newly characterised psg gene has evolved from a duplication of the entire psg <dig> gene followed by an internal duplication of the n <dig> domain. there may be functional significance associated with the n <dig> domain duplication. the complex nature of psg gene evolution, including putative gene conversion and recombination events between family members  <cit> , makes it difficult to analyse their evolution. despite this, the data generated from clustalx alignments and nj trees enabled us to generate trees that allow prediction of the order of events of domain duplications in psg <dig>  psg <dig> and psg <dig>  we note that the apparent route to domain number expansion differed between psg <dig>  and psg <dig> and psg <dig>  the extra n-domains of psg <dig> are derived from two duplications of the n <dig> domain. however, for psg <dig> and psg <dig>  independent duplications of each of the n <dig> and n <dig> domains were probably followed by a secondary duplication of the daughter domains, possibly as a single event.

gene expression data from rt-pcr of placental rna and est database analysis revealed considerable differences in the expression levels of different psg genes. in this analysis psg <dig> and psg <dig> were the most abundant, consistent with a previous report of abundant psg <dig> expression  <cit> . whilst there was generally good agreement between the two methods of expression analysis we cannot determine, based on current data, whether psg gene expression differences reflect selection for divergent functions, or increased gene dosage for enhancement of an existing function, because expression levels were uniformly low for many family members, and there was a general trend of increased expression during gestation. psg transcripts are found from day  <dig>  of embryonic development onward in primary trophoblast giant cells, later  in spongiotrophoblast cells and, to a lesser extent, in a cell population in the deciduas basalis at day  <dig>   <cit> . at present, it is unclear whether the various psg genes exhibit different cellular expression patterns, which might indicate divergent functions of the various psgs. there are interesting parallels between the expansion of the psg gene family and similar expansions of other placentally-expressed gene families such as the prolactin and growth hormone families  <cit> , and the aspartic and cysteine proteases  <cit> . such duplications may be a manifestation of parent-offspring conflict or inter-sibling rivalry over maternal investment  <cit> .

having collated all known mouse psg gene protein coding sequences and protein domain structures, the mouse psg genomic locus on chromosome  <dig> remained to be determined to complete a comprehensive resource for the analysis of psg function. the ncbi build  <dig> composite mouse assembly data revealed that only four psgs had been mapped. other psgs on contig nt_ <dig> are currently unordered. we therefore screened cosmid, yac and bac libraries, and orientated psg-containing clones to identify, where possible, the order of psg genes within the locus. we were not able to resolve all ambiguities in gene order on our map; however, where public database information is available, our data are in good agreement. we found no clear relationship between gene location and gene expression level suggesting that, within the psg locus, each psg gene is autonomously regulated.

CONCLUSIONS
the evolution and physiological functions of the relatively understudied mouse psg gene family are poorly understood. this is a feature shared with other placentally-expressed, multigene families such as the prolactin and growth hormone genes  <cit> . in order to provide a comprehensive resource to facilitate functional studies of mouse psg genes, including the generation of mouse mutants with modified psg gene expression profiles, we have collated the entire set of mouse psg genes, their predicted encoded proteins, and their evolutionary histories. the complete cds data will enable the cloning, over-expression, and gene targeting of individual or multiple mouse psg genes. this will facilitate the elucidation of their function and, by extrapolation, their human homologues, which may be involved in diseases of pregnancy.
