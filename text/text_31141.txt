BACKGROUND
pluripotency, the ability to differentiate into all embryonic tissues, is a defining characteristic of embryonic stem cells and of induced pluripotent stem cells. understanding how to induce, modulate, and maintain the pluripotent state of mammalian cells is of great importance for the development of critical tools for regenerative medicine. pluripotency has been shown to be the product of an extended transcriptional network <cit>  that can be fully activated by the viral mediated overexpression of defined transcription factors: klf <dig>  oct <dig>  sox <dig> and c-myc <cit> . among these four factors, klf <dig> has been suggested to have a higher functional hierarchical position  <cit>  that is shared by other members of the klf transcription factors family, including klf <dig>  <cit> .

while viral overexpression of transcription factors has been an invaluable tool to investigate the molecular basis of pluripotency, the presence in reprogrammed cells of viral genomes seems to be a barrier for the implementation of safe regenerative therapies. in light of this, small molecules are currently seen as plausible alternative to induce the expression of the critical transcription factors and, eventually, pluripotency  <cit> .

our laboratory has recently shown that the cell permeable nucleoside aicar can induce the expression of different members of the klf family of transcription factors in endothelial cells . thus, we hypothesized that aicar could induce klf <dig> and klf <dig> expression in other cell types and that it could activate the pluripotency transcriptional network. here we show that aicar induces klf <dig> and klf <dig> expression and activates the pluripotency transcriptional network in mesc. this effect is able to antagonize mesc retinoic acid induced differentiation. moreover, aicar is able to induce klf <dig>  klf <dig> and myc expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the prototypical somatic cells used for reprogramming studies. our data describes a new property of aicar in modulating mesc pluripotency network, and defines this small molecule as a new potential tool for the pharmacological reprogramming of somatic cells.

RESULTS
aicar induces the expression of klf <dig> and klf <dig> and activates the pluripotency transcriptional network in mesc
the j <dig> mesc line is a well characterized pluripotent cell line derived from the  <dig> sv/j mouse strain. this cell line was used to assess the effects of aicar on gene expression in pluripotent cells. es cells were plated at 5000/cm <dig> and exposed to  <dig> mm aicar for  <dig> h. gene expression was measured by total rna extraction followed by rna reverse transcription and real-time taqman quantitative pcr. as seen in figure  <dig>  aicar induced a  <dig> fold upregulation of klf <dig> and a  <dig>  fold upregulation of klf <dig>  concomitantly, aicar treatment induced the activation of the pluripotency transcription network as demonstrated by the upregulation of the pluripotency keeper transcription factors nanog  <cit> , oct <dig>  <cit> , myc  <cit>  and sox <dig>  <cit> 

aicar antagonizes retinoic acid induced differentiation of mesc
in order to further assess the effects of aicar on the pluripotency transcriptional network, mesc were treated with aicar in the presence of high doses of retinoic acid , a well-characterized differentiating agent that induces downregulation of several members of the pluripotency transcriptional network, including klf <dig>  klf <dig>  nanog, oct <dig> and sox <dig>  <cit> . as shown in figure 2a, aicar rescued ra mediated downregulation of nanog , oct <dig> , klf <dig>  and klf <dig> . aicar didn't rescue ra mediated sox <dig> downregulation. the analysis of the aicar effects on ra induced differentiation by morphological and alkaline phosphatase criteria  <cit>  confirmed the ability of aicar to partially antagonize ra induced differentiation. in mesc colonies exposed to ra, aicar was in fact able to significantly rescue the loss of alkaline phosphatase positivity associated with differentiation  and, to a lesser extent, to reduce differentiation related colony morphological changes . these results were confirmed with the e <dig> mesc line.

aicar induces klf <dig>  klf <dig> and myc upregulation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
embryonic fibroblasts are the prototypical cells used to study transcription factor induced somatic reprogramming  <cit> . we therefore tested the effect of aicar on mouse embryonic fibroblasts . as shown in figure  <dig>  aicar induces expression of klf <dig> , klf <dig>  and myc  in mefs. however, under these conditions, aicar was not able to orchestrate the complete activation of the transcriptional pluripotency network as documented by the absence of aicar-induced expression of nanog, oct <dig> or sox <dig> .

discussion
pluripotency is the product of the activation of a complex transcriptional network that induces expression of genes encoding transcription factors, signal transduction components, and chromatin-modifying enzymes. the pluripotency transcriptional network seems to be the same in both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells . while there have been few reports of small molecules that can maintain pluripotency of embryonic stem cells  <cit> , there are no reports of molecules tested for their ability of both modulating the transcriptional network in embryonic stem cells and regulating the expression of pluripotency inducing transcription factors in somatic cells.

in the present work we show that aicar is able to activate the pluripotency transcriptional network in mesc and to upregulate klf <dig>  klf <dig> and myc expression in murine fibroblasts. the effect of aicar as activator of the pluripotency molecular circuitry is clearly shown by the aicar-mediated induction of the master regulators of pluripotency nanog, oct <dig>  myc and sox <dig> and by the aicar-mediated induction of klf <dig> and klf <dig>  two transcription factors highly expressed in undifferentiated escs, which are quickly downregulated upon induction of differentiation <cit> . the effect of upregulating these transcription factors on the pluripotency transcriptional network is further supported by the ability of aicar to antagonize ra-induced differentiation. while the aicar effect is not dominant over the differentiating action of ra, both the gene expression analysis, and the alkaline phosphatase staining clearly demonstrate that aicar significantly antagonizes ra induced differentiation by competing against ra mediated silencing of pluripotency related genes.

our experiments with mefs show that aicar is able to upregulate klf <dig>  klf <dig> and myc also in somatic cells. in contrast to the effects exerted on mesc, in this context aicar is not able to induce oct <dig>  nanog or sox <dig> expression and is therefore not able to activate the pluripotency network. this result is not surprising if we consider that while klf <dig> has been suggested to be able to regulate the expression of all the transcription factors required for somatic cell reprogramming  <cit> , this ability is conditional to a proper chromatin status and the function of a set of coactivators that are likely not present in fibroblasts in the absence of other stimuli. moreover, aicar induces a klf <dig> upregulation of about  <dig>  fold. this upregulation is much smaller than the klf <dig> upregulation obtained by the viral mediated overexpression methods used in all the somatic cell reprogramming protocols described  <cit> . while aicar by itself is not able to reprogram fibroblasts, aicar mediated klf <dig> induction in somatic cells is of particular interest in the context of the current quest for small molecule mediated induction of pluripotency. moreover, the fact that aicar promotes pluripotency in mesc suggests that aicar effect on klf <dig> transcription is not linked to other pro differentiating actions and that aicar might be successfully used in pluripotency inducing small molecules cocktails.

aicar has been previously shown to have a number of effects on cellular function  <cit>  including effects on cellular differentiation. aicar has been in fact shown to have anti-differentiating effects  and pro-differentiating effects . we now report an effect of aicar as antagonist of retinoic acid induced differentiation in embryonic stem cells. the molecular basis of these contrasting effects of aicar on cell differentiation is not clear but it might reflect the fact that different molecular mechanisms maintain different levels of multipotency in different cell types <cit> .

our present data clearly do not provide a mechanism underlying aicar effects on mesc pluripotency and klf transcription in fibroblasts. since aicar has been previously shown to prevent skeletal myoblasts differentiation via activation of the longevity regulator sirt <dig>  <cit> , it is intriguing to speculate that sirt <dig> might be downstream of aicar in the regulation of embryonic stem cell pluripotency, establishing a connection between the molecular mechanism of aging and the molecular basis of pluripotency. aicar mediated upregulation of klf <dig> and klf <dig> in mefs could be mediated by the same mechanism underlying activation of the pluripotency network in mesc or by a different one, like activation of mef <dig>  a known target of aicar in muscle cells  <cit>  and a known regulator of klf <dig> and klf <dig> expression in endothelial cells <cit> 

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, this work describes for the first time a small molecule that is both able to activate the pluripotency transcriptional network in mesc, and to induce the expression in somatic cells of two of the four transcription factors required for reprogramming. our study identifies aicar as a pharmacological space important for the establishment and/or maintenance of induced pluripotent stem cells.
