BACKGROUND
blue mould is the most common postharvest disease of cold stored apples and pears  <cit> . besides penicillium expansum, the main causal agent of blue mould, other species of penicilllium can cause blue mould on fruit, including penicillium chrysogenum, penicillium crustosum, penicillium griseofulvum, and penicillium solitum . penicillium griseofulvum dierckx  can cause blue mould without being associated with p. expansum: apples cv golden delicious stored in italy for 6 months showed blue mould and p. griseofulvum was the only species isolated from the rots  <cit> . p. griseofulvum is globally distributed and has been isolated also from other fruit species and various environments such as desert soil, cereal grains and animal feed  <cit> .

classification of penicillium moulds, which comprises over  <dig> recognized species  <cit> , has evolved since their first description. most mycologists use primarily morphological criteria, which alone do not allow unambiguous classification. therefore, classification within the genus penicillium has been revised on the basis of various newly considered criteria, among which the production of specific secondary metabolites  has been considered  <cit> .

sm are structurally heterogeneous low-molecular-mass molecules, and although chemically diverse, they are produced by few core biosynthetic pathways  <cit> . some sm are harmful mycotoxins, such as patulin  <cit> . others are medically attractive as drugs and are used to efficiently combat human disease, for example penicillin or griseofulvin. sometimes detrimental and beneficial sm can be produced by the same species, as in p. griseofulvum  <cit> , which is known to produce both patulin and griseofulvin. p. griseofulvum is also known to be able to synthesize other secondary metabolites, such as roquefortine c, penicillin, cyclopiazonic acid and chanoclavine i  <cit> . to elucidate the molecular and enzymatic mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of a specific sm compound, a crucial step is the identification of the biosynthetic genes, which are generally arranged in clusters  <cit> . so far, apart from penicillin, no gene cluster has been yet identified for the biosynthesis of important secondary metabolites produced by p. griseofulvum  <cit> . recently, comparative genomics and transcriptomics tools have revolutionized the research on sm gene clusters in fungi, including penicillia .

patulin is a toxic fungal compound which produces acute and chronic toxicity, mainly genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, as well as cytotoxicity  <cit> . assessment of the health risks due to patulin consumption by humans has led many countries to regulate its amount in food  <cit> . the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster for patulin was first described in p. expansum and aspergillus clavatus  <cit> . the genetic content of the clusters described in the two species, comprising  <dig> genes, seemed to be identical, but the gene order greatly varied. in addition a p. expansum strain was found to contain the patulin cluster but was unable to synthesize the compound  <cit> . so far, no information is available about the patulin cluster in p. griseofulvum, which is necessary to better understand the mechanisms leading to patulin production in this fungus and to define strategies for patulin reduction in food.

besides patulin, studies have shown that p. griseofulvum is able to produce the mycotoxin roquefortine c  <cit> . roquefortine c was first isolated from penicillium roqueforti and since then it has been reported from  <dig> different penicillium species  <cit> , that grow on different hosts and matrices, such as contaminated beer, feed grain, and onions  <cit> . roquefortine c contamination of food and feedstuff is of relevance because of the well-known neurotoxicity of this mycotoxin  <cit> . in  <dig>  the roquefortine c biosynthesis pathway was discovered for the first time in p. chrysogenum  <cit> . later on, this pathway was refined and the exact roquefortine/meleagrin  biosynthetic gene cluster with the corresponding pathway was elucidated  <cit> . although the cluster is composed of seven genes, only three of them are needed for roquefortine production in p. chrysogenum   <cit> . recently, kosalková and collaborators  <cit>  reported the roquefortine gene cluster in p. roqueforti, which is shorter than the p. chrysogenum r/m seven-gene cluster. this cluster leads to the synthesis of roquefortine c rather than meleagrin as a final product. considering that p. griseofulvum is frequently isolated from apple, corn, wheat, barley, flour, walnuts, and from meat products  <cit> , it could be a potential source of roquefortine c in food. therefore, it is of great interest to study the genes encoding the roquefortine c production in this fungal species.

p. griseofulvum is known to produce also useful sm, including griseofulvin  <cit> . besides its recognized antifungal properties against a wide variety of plant pathogens  <cit> , griseofulvin has been used for many years in medical and veterinary applications  <cit> . recently, its potential use in cancer chemotherapy has been recognized due to its specific antimitotic and antiproliferative action toward cancer cells . interestingly, griseofulvin has also shown to suppress the replication of the hepatitis c virus in vitro  <cit> . the biosynthetic pathway of griseofulvin has been extensively studied using isotopic incorporation . the biosynthetic gene cluster consisting of  <dig> putative genes has been reported in penicillium aethiopicum , but the genes forming the griseofulvin cluster in p. griseofulvum are still unknown.

here we report the complete genome sequence of p. griseofulvum strain pg <dig> and describe some important sm clusters present in the studied strain, the expression of their key genes, as well as the analysis of their sm production both in vitro and in vivo. this resource will allow further insight into sm synthesis in p. griseofulvum.

RESULTS

we compared the genome of p. griseofulvum with the genomes of  <dig> other fully-sequenced penicillium and aspergillus species. to determine the phylogenetic position of p. griseofulvum in relation with the other sequenced species, we reconstructed a species tree based on the concatenation of  <dig>  genes that were found to be single copy in all considered species. our results show that p. griseofulvum branched off after the divergence of penicillium oxalicum but before the divergence of p. chrysogenum .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood species tree of pg <dig> and the other fourteen studied species. the species tree is derived from gene concatenation of  <dig>  single-copy genes present in the newly sequenced genome pg <dig>  in the other sequenced penicillium genomes , and in members of the aspergillus and talaromyces clades



we used smurf  <cit>  in order to predict all the possible sm clusters encoded in p. griseofulvum. smurf was able to identify  <dig> sm gene clusters with  <dig> signature proteins, which puts it on level with p. expansum in terms of capacity to synthesize sm compounds and above any other sequenced penicillium   <cit> . among the signature proteins there were  <dig> nrps,  <dig> pks,  <dig> nrps-pks hybrids and  <dig> dmat proteins. the remaining proteins being similar to nrps or pks proteins. these numbers are again similar to the ones found in p. expansum with the exception that p. expansum has a double amount of nrps-pks hybrid proteins and half the amount of the dmat proteins than p. griseofulvum.

genome-wide analysis of p. griseofulvum pg <dig> genes revealed putative gene clusters for patulin, griseofulvin and roquefortine c biosynthesis
the presence of known sm clusters in pg <dig> was analysed by searching for homologs of  <dig> known gene clusters taken from the bibliography and  <dig> additional clusters downloaded from mibig   <cit>  . we were able to detect the presence of gene clusters putatively responsible for the synthesis of patulin, roquefortine c / meleagrin, griseofulvin, penicillin, cyclopiazonic acid, yanuthone d and chanoclavine i . . besides the bioinformatic analysis of these gene clusters, we quantified the production of patulin, griseofulvin and roquefortine c by p. griseofulvum pg <dig> which are very important either for their beneficial medical and veterinary applications or because of their toxicity and the risk for human safety. the quantification was done in vitro and on apples. furthermore, the sm detected during apple infection were closely examined by studying the expression kinetics of their key genes under controlled conditions.

patulin production by p. griseofulvum
the patulin gene cluster found in p. griseofulvum pg <dig> is formed by  <dig> genes , positioned in the same gene order as the one found in p. expansum  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> comparison of patulin gene cluster in pg <dig> and in phylogenetically close patulin producing species. the species used for comparison are p. expansum and a. clavatus which have a complete patulin gene cluster  <cit> . each gene is indicated by an arrow and named according to its position in the original cluster described in a. clavatus  <cit> 



the presence of a complete patulin cluster in pg <dig> is congruent with the results obtained by ballester and collaborators   <cit> , who predicted that the presence of this cluster is likely an ancestral trait in penicillium spp., predating the divergence of p. roqueforti. interestingly, the similarities in gene order found between the patulin gene cluster in p. expansum and p. griseofulvum indicate that the changes in gene order observed between the cluster in aspergillus clavatus and the cluster in p. griseofulvum and p. expansum happened before the two penicillium species diverged.

patulin production in p. griseofulvum pg <dig> is considerable  after 3 days of incubation in vitro and increased significantly to reach  <dig> .71 μg/plate at day  <dig> . interestingly, these concentrations are in the same range as the patulin production found in p. expansum strain pex <dig>  <cit> , although pg <dig> exhibited distinct differences in colony morphology and slower growth kinetics compared with pex <dig> .fig.  <dig> patulin production and relative expression of key patulin genes in p. griseofulvum pg <dig>  a patulin production in vitro. b patulin production in apple. c. relative gene expression  of patk, patg, patl and patn in pg <dig>  the gene expression is relative to the geometric mean of the four p. griseofulvum reference genes: the ribosomal 28s rna, the 37s ribosomal protein , the beta-tubulin  and the histone h <dig> . spore suspensions of strains were inoculated on the centre of 55 mm pda plates and incubated at 24 °c in the dark for up to 10 days post inoculation . error bars indicate standard deviations of three biological replicates. different letters above the columns indicate a significant difference determined by tukey's multiple comparison test 



we further investigated the ability of pg <dig> to produce patulin in artificially contaminated apples. at  <dig> dpi, the patulin concentration produced by pg <dig> was about  <dig>  μg patulin/kg of fruit, then it increased as a function of time to reach  <dig> .30 μg patulin/kg at  <dig> dpi . the values of patulin produced by the p. griseofulvum strain highly exceeded recommended maximum acceptable limits set by the european union and are similar to those reported by welke and collaborators   <cit> .

in addition, we investigated the expression pattern of four genes from the patulin biosynthetic cluster: patk , patg , patn , and patl, which encodes the pathway specific transcription factor . the expression profiles were very similar for the four genes and clearly different from those observed in their p. expansum orthologous  <cit> . in pg <dig>  the gene expression levels remained relatively constant or slightly decreased at  <dig> dpi but the differences were not statistically significant.. in contrast, the expression of patk, patn, and patl in p. expansum pex <dig> increased over time, reaching a maximum at the latest sampled time, with a  <dig> to  <dig> fold induction at  <dig> dpi with respect to  <dig> dpi  <cit> . the difference in gene expression profiles between the two penicillium species could be probably related to the cluster regulatory mechanisms since patl expression barely changed over time in pg <dig>  but it increased in p. expansum leading probably to an increased expression of the whole cluster. from these results it is apparent that these two species have developed different mechanisms for regulating patulin production.

a partial cluster of roquefortine c and meleagrin is responsible for the production of roquefortine c in p. griseofulvum pg <dig> 
in addition to the patulin gene cluster, we detected the roquefortine c / meleagrin  gene cluster which is only partially conserved . it was established that a single cluster of coregulated genes encodes the biosynthesis of both mycotoxins roquefortine c and meleagrin in p. chrysogenum, in which this cluster has been well characterized in the last decade  <cit> .fig.  <dig> comparison of the roquefortine c cluster genes in pg <dig> and in other penicillium species. the species in which the roquefortine c cluster has been described are p. chrysogenum and p. roqueforti . each gene is named according to its position in the original cluster described in p. chrysogenum  <cit> . additional genes within the cluster are marked with a grey arrow, and stripped arrow represents a pseudogene



when compared with the p. chrysogenum r/m gene cluster, p. griseofulvum pg <dig> contains only four genes roqa, roqr, roqd and roqt, encoding roquefortine dipeptide synthetase, roquefortine d dehydrogenase, roquefortine prenyltransferase, and mfs transporter respectively  <cit> , and an additional gene present between roqd and roqt. the order and orientation of these genes are identical to the p. chrysogenum r/m gene cluster.

the three orthologous genes of roqo, roqn, and roqm that are absent in pg <dig> strain are involved in the late reaction steps of the meleagrin pathway and encode a flavin-dependent n-hydroxylase, a scaffold reorganizing oxygenase and a methyltransferase respectively  <cit> .

interestingly, kosalková and collaborators  <cit>  reported that three strains of p. roqueforti also contained the r/m core cluster but lacked the genes involved in the conversion of roquefortine c into meleagrin, leading to the synthesis of roquefortine c rather than meleagrin. p. roqueforti contains roqa, roqr, roqd and a non-functional pseudogene roqt . however roqo, roqm and roqn were absent in the p. roqueforti strain used in our analysis, whereas they are present in p. oxalicum, which is known to produce roquefortine as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of oxaline  <cit> . we investigated the r/m gene cluster in a group of penicillium genomes and the complete cluster was found only in p. oxalicum and p. chrysogenum . p. oxalicum presents an inversion of several genes when compared to the cluster of p. chrysogenum and has an additional gene located between roqm and roqr. in penicillium digitatum, penicillium italicum, and penicillium camemberti the r/m gene cluster was lacking, while p. roqueforti, p. expansum, and p. griseofulvum had at least the genes  needed to synthesize roquefortine c. the latter species had their remaining genes located in the same order found in p. chrysogenum indicating that the inversion happened either specifically in p. oxalicum or after its divergence from the other sequenced penicillium species.

in order to confirm that p. griseofulvum pg <dig> was indeed able to synthesize roquefortine c, we studied its production in vitro and in artificially infected apples.

the results showed that pg <dig> exclusively produced roquefortine c in vitro, reaching an amount of  <dig>  μg/plate after 10 days of incubation in pda plates . as expected, we did not detect the production of meleagrin by pg <dig> fig.  <dig> roquefortine c production by p. griseofulvum pg <dig> in vitro




naturally occurring roquefortine c has been already detected in apples still on the tree and in windfall apples, however, it has not yet been reported in rotted pome fruits  <cit> .

interestingly, no roquefortine c production by pg <dig> was detected in apples during the 10 days of artificial infection, which could be explained by the fact that maybe the apple rot conditions are not favourable for roquefortine c production.

griseofulvin production by p. griseofulvum

as mentioned before, p. griseofulvum is known to produce griseofulvin. the gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of this compound was originally described in p. aethiopicum  <cit> . the cluster in p. aethiopicum is formed by a polyketide synthase , three o-methylation proteins , a chlorination , a grisan ring formation , an alkene reduction , a putative isochorismatase , a putative oxidoreductase , and an efflux pump   <cit> . in addition, the griseofulvin cluster in p. aethiopicum contained two transcription factors gsfr <dig> and gsfr <dig>  but it is unclear if both or either of them is involved in the regulation of the cluster  <cit> .

interestingly, when we compared the griseofulvin gene cluster of p. aethiopicum  with the one found in pg <dig> , we found that three genes were not located within the cluster in pg3: gsfh, gsfk and the transcription factor gsfr <dig>  gsfh and gsfk are not required for griseofulvin production so their absence from within the cluster is not surprising. the absence of gsfr <dig> could have an effect on the expression conditions of the cluster but there is an homolog of this protein in another region in the genome therefore we cannot discard the option that it is still playing a function in the regulation of griseofulvin cluster.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the griseofulvin gene cluster in p. aethiopicum and pg <dig>  each gene is named according to its position in the original cluster described in p. aethiopicum 



a previous study reported that apple medium is one of the best media for griseofulvin and patulin production by p. griseofulvum  <cit> , but to our knowledge, no studies have yet explored griseofulvin production by p. griseofulvum during apple infection. this analysis could help to identify the suitable conditions for the production of such an important sm in the environment/orchard.

pg <dig> produced significant levels of griseofulvin both in vitro and on apples, in increasing amount over the time to reach, at  <dig> dpi, about 215 μg per plate in vitro and  <dig>  μg per kg of apples .fig.  <dig> griseofulvin production and relative expression of key griseofulvin genes in p. griseofulvum pg <dig>  a griseofulvin production in vitro. b griseofulvin production in apple. c relative gene expression of gsfa, gsfi and gsfr <dig> in p. griseofulvum pg <dig>  the gene expression is relative to the geometric mean of the three p. griseofulvum reference genes: the ribosomal 28s rna, the 37s ribosomal protein , the tubulin  and the histone h <dig> . error bars indicate standard deviations of three biological replicates. different letters above the columns indicate a significant difference determined by tukey's multiple comparison test 



the production of griseofulvin by the newly sequenced p. griseofulvum pg <dig> strain indicates that the lack of gsfr <dig> within the gene cluster is apparently not affecting the synthesis of griseofulvin under the tested conditions. however we do not know whether or not this gene is nevertheless involved in the synthesis of this compound.

we further analysed the expression of three genes from the griseofulvin gene cluster: gsfr <dig>  which codes for a transcription factor, gsfi, coding for a halogenase that catalyses the last step in the synthesis of griseofulvin, and gsfa, which encodes the polyketide synthase. the three analysed gsf genes showed a constitutive expression under the assayed conditions . interestingly, the normalized expression levels of the genes coding for the two structural proteins  are much higher than those from the patulin biosynthetic cluster.

bioinformatic prediction of additional secondary metabolite clusters
p. griseofulvum is known to be able to synthesize penicillin and cyclopiazonic acid  <cit>  but the genes involved in the production of these compounds are still unknown.

therefore we search for additional clusters within pg <dig> genome to identify putative genes encoding for these sm . the gene cluster for penicillin synthesis was found and is homologous to the one found in p. chrysogenum . the cluster for cyclopiazonic acid synthesis was also found and is homologous to the one described in aspergillus oryzae. the only particularity is that it lacked a regulatory protein, which was also absent in different strains of a.oryzae . oddly, in p. griseofulvum the genes cpat and cpam are predicted as fused into a single protein, this is possibly due to a frame shift towards the end of cpat which provokes the stop codon misreading. gene fusion is not uncommon since it has been observed previously in other biosynthetic pathways such as the mycophenolic pathway  <cit> . the cyclopiazonic gene cluster is only conserved in p. camemberti of all the other penicillium species considered and this species shows the same gene fusion.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of additional gene clusters in p. griseofulvum pg <dig>  : penicillin, : cyclopiazonic acid, : yanuthone d. each gene is named according to its position in the original cluster described in literature.



in addition to the described clusters, we found an additional gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of the antibiotic yanuthone d  which was described in aspergillus niger  <cit> . the cluster is complete and has the same gene order as in a. niger, the only peculiarity is that it encodes an additional gene of unknown function. this gene cluster is conserved in other penicillium species, such as p. chrysogenum and p. italicum, while it was almost completely lost in p. roqueforti, p. camemberti, and p. oxalicum and shows some signs of degradation in p. expansum and p. digitatum. all penicillium genomes having the cluster contain this additional gene suggesting that it was acquired at the base of penicillium speciation or lost specifically in a. niger.

p. griseofulvum is also known to synthesize other compounds such as chanoclavine i, cyclopiamide, dehydrofulvic acid, mycelinamide, and phenylpyropene  <cit> . there is little information about most of these clusters making it difficult to predict which clusters could be able to synthesize these compounds. despite this, we were able to locate a group of genes that is likely responsible for the synthesis of chanoclavine i. this compound is well known as an intermediate needed to synthesize ergot alkaloids  <cit> . several genes have been related to its synthesis in different species such as in a. japonicus, a. fumigatus and a. nidulans : a dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase, a methyltransferase, a catalase, and a chanoclavine-i synthase oxidoreductase. we found a group of seven genes clustering together, four of these genes encoded homologs for genes involved in the synthesis of ergot alkaloids in epichloe species. these genes were dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase , oxidoreductase , catalase  and phytanoyl-coa dioxygenase . the first three genes are known to synthesize the first steps of the ergot alkaloid pathway and resulting in chanoclavine i . a fourth gene is missing in order to have the complete pathway, a methyltransferase . among the remaining three genes found within the cluster, one of them encoded a methyltransferase that is not homologous to easf. it is possible that this gene was transferred at the base of pezizomycotina by streptomyces species as there are only homologs of these gene in p. griseofulvum, p. expansum, the dothideomycetes cochliobolus heterostrophus and the sordariomycetes metarhizium anisopliae. the phylogenetic tree is consistent with this assessment, as it places these small group of fungi as sister group of streptomyces spp..

the presence of three additional genes that are not known to be involved in the synthesis of chanoclavine i opens the door to the possibility that chanoclavine i is, also in p. griseofulvum, only an intermediate and that the final compound synthesized by the specific gene cluster is a derivative of chanoclavine i. this gene cluster is conserved also in p. expansum, but this species is not known to synthesize chanoclavine i reinforcing the hypothesis that chanoclavine i is not the end product of this cluster.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome of the postharvest pathogen p. griseofulvum allowed the identification of a complete putative gene clusters for patulin, griseofulvin and roquefortine c biosynthesis. in addition, we found additional sm clusters, including those potentially responsible for the synthesis of penicillin, yanuthone d, cyclopiazonic acid, and predicted a cluster involved in the synthesis of chanoclavine i. these findings provide relevant information to understand the molecular basis of sm biosynthesis in p. griseofulvum. future studies should consider the role of sm biosynthesis in p. griseofulvum in the pathogenetic process of colonization of apple and other fruit species. it is also necessary to better understand the mechanisms leading to patulin production in this fungus to help defining strategies for patulin reduction to avoid consumer health threats and increase food safety. this resource will also allow further research directed to the overexpression or blocking of specific sm synthesis, to assess its potential in terms of biotechnological applications for beneficial sm, such as griseofulvin.
