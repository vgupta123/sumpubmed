BACKGROUND
pyridine nucleotides , which include nad+, nadp+, nadh and nadph, are ubiquitous coenzymes involved in redox reactions in all organisms  <cit> . in plants, pns act as developmental cues during the process of seed germination  <cit>  and for transitioning from the vegetative to reproductive state  <cit> . levels of pns in plants are altered by light conditions and age of plants  <cit> . changes in pn level in response to abiotic stresses like chilling and drought or in response to fungal elicitors and pathogens have also been reported  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that extracellular pns induce pathogenesis-related  gene expression and disease resistance pathways in arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, pn homeostasis impacts several developmental and stress signaling pathways in plants.

several studies in animal systems have shown that the ratio of oxidized to reduced form of pns, especially nad+: nadh, acts as an important signal that connects metabolic states of the cell to its gene expression pattern  <cit> . cellular pn levels, or more importantly, redox states, are sensed by repressors of gene expression, which in turn regulate chromatin architecture  <cit> . however, the enzymes regulating pn levels and in turn its impact on gene expression have not been well studied in plants.

nudix  hydrolases play a vital role in cellular homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of a variety of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives including nadh, nad+, adp-ribose, ntps, dntps, phosphoinositol derivatives, and capped mrnas  <cit> . since these substrates have regulatory roles or may be toxic, nudix hydrolases play a key role in signaling and house-cleaning processes. there are  <dig> nudix hydrolases identified in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . in vitro enzymatic analyses have been carried out for nine cytosolic nudix hydrolases of arabidopsis  <cit> . the first characterized plant nudix hydrolase, atnudt <dig>  was nadh pyrophosphatase  <cit> . atnudt <dig> was later shown to be the canonical mutt-type nudix hydrolase in arabidopsis, important for scavenging oxidized nucleotides, especially deoxyguanosines  <cit> . recently, it was shown that over-expression of atnudt <dig>  an adp-ribose pyrophosphatase, confers enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress  <cit> . this enhanced tolerance was attributed to maintenance of nad and atp levels by nucleotide recycling from free adp-ribose under stress conditions  <cit> . several independent research groups have analyzed various aspects of arabidopsis nudix hydrolase  <dig>   <cit> . in vitro analysis demonstrated that atnudt <dig> could use both nadh and adp-ribose as substrates  <cit> . over-expression of atnudt <dig>  led to a decrease in both nadh and adp-ribose levels, whereas in a t-dna knockout line, atnudt7- <dig>  , the levels of these two metabolites were higher than wild-type  plants grown under the same conditions, suggesting that both nadh and adp-ribose are physiological substrates of this protein  <cit> .

the knockout arabidopsis mutant, atnudt7- <dig>  which was previously referred to as growth factor gene  <dig> , has been described as having pleiotropic phenotypes such as reduced size, higher levels of reactive oxygen species , microscopic cell death, constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related  genes, and improved resistance to a virulent bacterial pathogen, pseudomonas syringae dc <dig>  <cit> . both atnudt7- <dig> and an independent t-dna knockout line, atnudt7- <dig> , were reported to exhibit reduced size, higher levels of salicylic acid, and increased resistance to an oomycete pathogen, hyaloperonospora parasitica  <cit> . another independent group demonstrated constitutive pr gene expression, increased resistance to a virulent bacterial pathogen, and reduced hypersensitive response to avirulent bacterial pathogens  in atnudt7- <dig> mutant  <cit> . however, two other groups using the atnudt7- <dig> line reported no differences in the growth or morphology of mutant plants under normal growing conditions  <cit> .

this contradiction in reported atnudt7- <dig> phenotype combined with similar observations in our laboratory prompted us to examine this mutant more carefully. in this study, we describe a conditional growth phenotype of atnudt7- <dig> that is influenced by edaphic factors. mutant plants were reduced in size when grown in nutrient-poor mix of vermiculite: redi-earth: sand , but grew to the same size as wt plants when raised on nutrient-rich metro-mix . higher levels of atnudt <dig> protein were observed when wt plants were grown in 12:3: <dig> mix and under several abiotic and biotic stress conditions culminating in cell death. interestingly, increased nadh was observed in atnudt7- <dig> only under suboptimal growing conditions. affymetrix gene chip analysis of atnudt7- <dig> mutants grown under suboptimal conditions showed substantial changes in gene expression. genes associated with systemic acquired resistance  and cell death pathways were induced in the mutant. down regulation of several hormone-signaling pathways in the mutant indicated interconnections between pn homeostasis and phytohormones. these results demonstrate that atnudt <dig> plays a crucial role in regulating nad+: nadh balance under suboptimal conditions, which in turn modulates the activation of defense, phytohormones and cell death signaling pathways.

RESULTS
atnudt7- <dig> mutant exhibits a conditional phenotype
we observed that the type of potting mix influenced the phenotype of atnudt7- <dig> mutant. the typical stunted growth phenotype of atnudt7- <dig> was observed consistently when plants were raised in 12:3: <dig> potting mix. atnudt7- <dig> mutant plants in metro-mix  <dig>  were the same size as wt plants . in the 12:3: <dig> potting mix, growth of wt col- <dig> was comparable to the plants in mm for 3- <dig> weeks . we analyzed the nutrient composition of both mixes . the 12:3: <dig> potting mix had low levels of all tested macro- and micronutrients. in some cases, the levels of these nutrients were lower than the optimum range recommended. these data suggested that the phenotype of atnudt7- <dig> was strongly influenced by the microenvironment in which these plants were growing.

supplementing individual nutrients  in 12:3: <dig> potting mix to the levels observed in mm improved the growth habit of the mutant plants. however, compared with wt plants the mutant plants were still smaller in size . irrigating the mutant plants in 12:3: <dig> potting mix with a commercial fertilizer solution restored the wt phenotype with respect to size or biomass.

atnudt7- <dig> grown in 12:3: <dig> mix showed reduced growth of virulent bacterial pathogen p. syringae pathovar tomato , indicating enhanced resistance of these plants to pathogens  <cit>  . when atnudt7- <dig> plants were grown in mm the increased resistance to p. syringae was compromised .

atnudt <dig> is upregulated in plants grown under suboptimal conditions
atnudt <dig> protein shares close sequence homology to atnudt <dig> and atnudt <dig>  <cit> . in vitro assays indicate atnudt <dig> has affinity for adp-ribose and nadh, the preferred substrates for atnudt <dig> and atnudt <dig>  <cit> . we monitored the transcriptional profiles levels of these three nudix hydrolase genes under different growth conditions. steady-state transcript levels of atnudt <dig> and atnudt <dig> did not show any difference in col- <dig> plants grown in the two different potting mixes. compared to plants in mm a 2-fold up regulation of atnudt <dig> transcripts was observed in plants grown in 12:3: <dig> mix .

induction of atnudt <dig> protein was also observed in wt col- <dig> plants grown in 12:3: <dig> mix . accumulation of atnudt <dig> transcripts and protein under nutrient deficient growing conditions in wt plants suggests that this protein may play an important role under these situations.

atnudt <dig> protein levels are induced in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
we monitored atnudt <dig> protein accumulation in col- <dig> wt plants after infiltrating leaves with pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato  bacterial pathogen, which induces the hypersensitive cell death response. atnudt <dig> protein levels had accumulated to high levels by four hours of pathogen treatment . similarly, rapid accumulation of atnudt <dig> was observed after two hours of acute ozone treatment in the ozone sensitive ws- <dig> ecotype . we also observed that atnudt <dig> protein levels were induced within eight hours of wounding by a sharp blade . these data clearly demonstrated rapid induction of atnudt <dig> protein during both biotic and abiotic stress treatments that culminate in cell death.

over-expressing atnudt <dig> does not alter pn levels but alters expression of closely related nudix hydrolases
transgenic plants  that over-express atnudt <dig> under the control of constitutive cauliflower mosaic  <dig> s promoter  were generated in the wt col- <dig> background and confirmed by western analysis using atnudt <dig> polyclonal antibodies . the p35s:atnudt <dig> plants were similar to wt in size in both mm and 12:3: <dig> mix. p35s:atnudt <dig> plants infiltrated with p. syringae dc <dig> did not show any differences in pathogen growth compared with wt plants . levels of nad and nadh did not change in pro35s:atnudt <dig> plants when compared with the vector control or with wt col- <dig> plants grown in mm or 12:3: <dig> mix . another group over-expressing the atnudt <dig> gene under the control of  <dig> s promoter reported similar results  <cit> .

using real-time pcr, we monitored the expression levels of the closest homologs of atnudt <dig> in over-expressor lines and compared them to those of the atnudt7- <dig> mutant and wt plants . expression of atnudt <dig> and atnudt <dig> genes was higher in p35s: atnudt <dig> plants than wt. interestingly, atnudt <dig> was also highly expressed in atnudt7- <dig> mutant plants. the expression of atnudt <dig> was not altered in the p35s:atnudt <dig> and atnudt7- <dig> plants.

induction of atnudt <dig> protein is triggered by its substrates
exogenous application of nadh or adp-ribose to wt plants led to a substantial increase in atnudt <dig> protein levels when compared to control plants infiltrated with water . based on these observations, we speculate that nadh and adp-ribose are likely physiological substrates for atnudt <dig> or these metabolites may confer stability to this protein.

redox perturbations under suboptimal conditions are plausible triggers for inducing atnudt <dig> protein
glutathione levels were higher in atnudt7- <dig> mutant plants than wt plants grown under similar conditions, which was again consistent with an earlier study  <cit> . differences in glutathione levels in wt plants grown in the two different potting mixes were not significant .

amount of ascorbate  and dehydroascorbate  were similar in wt and atnudt7- <dig> plants grown in mm. asa levels in atnudt7- <dig> mutant growing in 12:3: <dig> potting mix were comparable to those observed in mm. interestingly, we observed nearly 30% decrease in the asa levels of wt plants grown in 12:3: <dig> mix . furthermore, dha levels were almost undetectable in the wt plants growing in 12:3: <dig> mix. this indicated that differences in potting mix caused significant changes in asa/dha redox couple in wt plants, even though their consequences did not manifest phenotypically.

comparison of nad+ levels in wt and atnudt7- <dig> plants growing in mm or in 12:3: <dig> mix did not show any significant differences . nad+ levels in plants growing in 12:3: <dig> mix was higher than in plants growing in mm but was not statistically significant for atnudt7- <dig>  atnudt7- <dig> plants in 12:3: <dig> mix showed almost 2-fold higher levels of nadh than wt plants . in contrast, atnudt7- <dig> plants in mm did not show any change in nadh levels compared to wt plants grown under identical conditions. the observed increase in nad+ and nadh levels in atnudt7- <dig> plants growing in 12:3: <dig> mix manifested as higher nadh: nad+ ratios when compared to plants growing in mm . these data showed that alterations in growth conditions including nutrient status impact nadh: nad+ ratios in plants, and lack of atnudt <dig> protein exaggerated the changes in this redox couple.

substantial changes in gene expression in atnudt7- <dig> plants grown under suboptimal conditions
based on studies in animal systems, we speculated that higher levels of nadh and gsh in atnudt7- <dig> plants under suboptimal conditions might bring about changes in gene expression. arabidopsis ath <dig> gene chips with  <dig>  probe sets representing  <dig>  genes were used to examine changes in transcript levels in atnudt7- <dig> plants with respect to expression observed in wt controls grown in 12:3: <dig> mix. experiments were conducted with 3-week-old plants since the phenotype of the mutant plants was distinct at this stage of development when grown in 12:3: <dig> potting mix. based on two biological replications of the genechip experiments ,  <dig> genes were reliably detected in the wt versus atnudt7- <dig> comparison. there were  <dig> genes that were 2-fold induced and  <dig> genes that were 2-fold repressed . thus, under suboptimal growing conditions, lack of atnudt <dig> protein resulted in extensive changes in gene expression.

to gain insight into the biological significance of the genes differentially expressed in atnudt7- <dig>  we used mapman analysis  <cit> . the overrepresented gene ontologies are presented in table  <dig>  marked changes in the expression of genes regulating transcription, protein degradation, signaling, redox and phytohormones were seen in the atnudt7- <dig> mutant . the majority of the transcription factor encoding genes  was repressed, while those induced belonged to the wrky family. the enrichment of go for transcription among the repressed genes is supportive of the role of pns as global metabolic regulators of gene expression  <cit> . identification of a large set of genes induced in response to biotic stress provides a molecular basis for the increased resistance to pathogens reported for atnudt7- <dig>  <cit> . four different thioredoxin genes were upregulated while four of the five differentially expressed glutaredoxins were down regulated , suggesting that the redox network is perturbed, perhaps due to imbalances in the redox input elements. down regulation of ethylene, auxin, jasmonate responsive genes and aba biosynthesis genes were observed in atnudt7- <dig> mutant. a gene encoding isochorismate synthase, important for salicylic acid  biosynthesis  <cit> , was up regulated, which may account for reported increase in sa levels in the atnudt7- <dig> mutant  <cit> .

the observed enrichment of genes involved in proteolysis led us to examine the total protease activity in the mutant plants. protein extracts from atnudt7- <dig> leaves exhibited significantly higher protease activity using azocasein as substrate, providing biochemical corroboration for the microarray data . addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl chloride, an inhibitor of ser proteases and papain family cysteine proteases  <cit> , or leupeptin, an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, reduced protease activity in both atnudt7- <dig> and wt plants. there was a significant reduction in protease activity in atnudt7- <dig> plant extracts after the addition of pmsf, indicating that serine proteases contributed most to the proteolytic activity.

the induction of signaling genes, especially receptor-like kinases  in the atnudt7- <dig> mutant, is intriguing . this observation suggested that changes in nad: nadh balance maybe sufficient to activate a number of rlks important for transducing signals to downstream mediators. the significant reduction in the atp levels of atnudt7- <dig> mutant suggests energy metabolism is compromised when pn balance is perturbed . the reported increases in sa levels and the gamut of phytohormone responsive genes and redox transmitters that are altered in the atnudt7- <dig> mutant in conjunction with the observed changes in nad+, nadh, gsh and ascorbate, suggests novel interconnections between redox signaling, antioxidative systems and phytohormone-mediated oxidative cell death pathways  <cit>  .

discussion
in this study, we report a conditional phenotypic response to an edaphic factor in atnudt7- <dig> mutant plants . in the two earlier reports indicating that atnudt7- <dig> did not show any obvious phenotypes, mutant plants were grown in soil that was fertilized  <cit>  or were grown on nutrient rich ms plates  <cit> . loss of stunted growth phenotype in atnudt7- <dig> plants grown in nutrient rich metro-mix is consistent with these earlier reports. restoration of wt phenotype in the atnudt7- <dig> plants grown in 12:3: <dig> mix supplemented with fertilizers demonstrated that this mutant is hyper-responsive to the growth micro-environment.

poor nutrient levels of 12:3: <dig> mix  were sufficient to induce atnudt <dig> protein in wt plants, indicating that expression of this protein is important under such suboptimal conditions . this is supported by strong and rapid accumulation of atnudt <dig> protein under conditions of pathogen, wounding and ozone stress . although the transcript levels of atnudt <dig> showed only transient induction for a few hours following stress treatments  <cit> , the protein was stable for  <dig> hours . the half-life prediction of  <dig> hours for atnudt <dig> by the protparam program of expasy supports this observation. it is also possible that some posttranslational modification could confer stability to the atnudt <dig> protein.

lack of atnudt <dig> protein resulted in elevated resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens  <cit> . however, our studies showed that the resistance to pathogens was compromised when atnudt7- <dig> mutants were raised in mm potting soil . over expression of atnudt <dig> protein in wt plants did not alter their phenotype nor alter growth of virulent and avirulent p. syringae pathogens . based on these observations, we argue that the increased resistance to pathogens observed in atnudt7- <dig> plants is an indirect effect of the mutation.

over-expression of atnudt <dig> led to elevated transcript levels of closely related nudix hydrolases  suggesting coordinate regulation of members of this gene family or regulation via the substrates on which these enzymes act. microarray data comparing atnudt7- <dig> and wt plants indicated transcript levels of several nudix hydrolases were altered. this included atnudt <dig> and atnudt <dig> that were induced, while expression of atnudt <dig>  atnudt <dig> and atnudt <dig> were repressed . in the light of these observations, we caution that analysis of pyrophosphohydrolase activities in transgenic lines overexpressing or silencing particular nudix hydrolases may be misleading.

in vitro studies of atnudt <dig> have revealed that this protein has significant pyrophosphohydrolase activity with nadh and adp-ribose  <cit> , and has recently been confirmed using transgenic lines  <cit> . inducibility of atnudt <dig> protein by nadh and adp-ribose provides indirect evidence that these metabolites may be its physiological substrates . however, the primary biochemical function of nudix hydrolase may not be the hydrolysis of its substrates  <cit> . it may be involved only in conformational change as demonstrated for ltrp <dig>  a nudix box containing protein, important for mediating calcium influx to trigger immune responses in animal immunocytes  <cit> .

atnudt7- <dig> mutant in 12:3: <dig> potting mix had 2-fold higher levels of nadh than wt plants grown under the same conditions . in the male-sterile cmsi mutant of nicotiana sylvestris, deficient in the mitochondrial complex i, levels of nad+ and nadh were 2-fold higher than wt plants  <cit>  and interestingly these plants showed growth retardation similar to atnudt <dig> mutant. interestingly, increase in nadh levels did not cause changes in ros levels in cmsii mutant but lead to reorchestration of antioxidative mechanisms resulting in higher tolerance to ozone and viral infections  <cit> . in another arabidopsis mutant deficient in cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , increases in nadh levels and in turn the nadh: nad+ ratio led to enhanced ros levels under standard growing conditions and significantly augmented h2o <dig> production under stress  <cit> . higher levels of nadh were reported in atnudt7- <dig> mutants six hours after infection with p. syringae  pathogen  <cit> . in protein analysis experiments following p. syringae  pathogen infection, we observed strong induction of atnudt <dig> protein at a comparable time point . this suggests under pathogen-imposed stress conditions nadh levels increase and atnudt <dig> may be required to restore nad+: nadh balance. such changes in nad+ and nadh levels during stress can lead to redox imbalance, triggering the production of ros via one-electron reduction of oxygen  <cit>  or may be important for orchestrating cellular antioxidant systems  <cit> . the higher ros levels observed in atnudt7- <dig>  <cit>  may be causally connected to the increase in nadh and/or nadh: nad+.

in the atnudt7- <dig> mutants exhibiting reduced size phenotype, levels of sa were reported to be 4- to 5-fold higher than wt  <cit> . several other sa-overproducing mutants have also been reported to exhibit a growth retardation phenotype  <cit> . the role of sa in sar against pathogens is well known  <cit> . furthermore, sa and ros induce each other and form a feed-forward self-amplifying loop  <cit> . the observed increase in ros levels in the atnudt7- <dig> mutant could be due to increased levels of sa.

this begs the question - why are sa levels high in the atnudt7- <dig> mutant? we speculate that an increase in sa levels may be brought about in response to redox perturbations. a positive correlation between an increase in sa levels and a corresponding increase in gsh levels using constitutive sa accumulating mutants, as well as by exogenous application of these metabolites, has been reported  <cit> . increasing the levels of gsh by transgenic approaches or chemical intervention was sufficient to mimic induction of sa response genes  <cit> . the earlier reported increases in sa  <cit>  and observed increases in gsh  in atnudt7- <dig> are consistent with the aforementioned studies. recently, it was reported that exogenous application of nad induced pathogenesis-related genes and resistance to p. syringae maculicola, as well as accumulation of sa  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that increased nadh levels or redox perturbations caused by changes in nadh:nad+ favoring the reductant, trigger the production and/or accumulation of physiologically coupled sa, gsh and ros in atnudt7- <dig> plants, that in turn leads to the observed pleiotropic phenotypes.

one of the other pleiotropic phenotype associated with atnudt7- <dig> is microscopic cell death  <cit> . the observed constitutive activation of proteolysis-associated genes in microarray analysis  and confirmation of enhanced proteolytic activity in atnudt7- <dig> plant extracts  provides a plausible explanation for the cell death phenotype. we speculate that the cell death phenotype is a manifestation of the interplay between the phytohormones, ros and proteolysis related genes  <cit> .

pns are key redox input elements in the regulatory thiol-disulfide network  <cit>  and have important roles in pro-oxidant and antioxidant metabolism  <cit> . pns have also been observed to play major roles in non-redox mechanisms that influence cell function. nad is considered a key modulator of cellular energy metabolism  <cit> . significant reduction in atp levels of atnudt7- <dig> mutant supports these earlier observations . several lines of evidence in animal systems suggest that nad also mediates cell death  <cit> , calcium homeostasis  <cit>  and gene expression  <cit> . substantial transcriptome alterations  observed in atnudt7- <dig> plants are in agreement with reports in the animal literature . changes in pns and gsh can also play an important role in gene regulation via components such as non-expressor of pr <dig>  protein  <cit> .

antagonistic cross-talk occurs at multiple levels between the sa-mediated signaling of the sar pathway and the aba-mediated responses to abiotic stress  <cit> . microarray analysis revealed that several abiotic stress signaling pathways were down regulated, in the atnudt7- <dig> mutant. this is in agreement with reports of antagonistic interactions between the sa-mediated defense in response to pathogens and aba signaling pathways  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
constitutive expression of atnudt <dig> under normal growing conditions is important for maintaining nad+: nadh homeostasis. stress, in the form of nutrient deficiency, pathogens, wounding or ozone, causes rapid and transient alterations in atnudt <dig> protein levels that can in turn alter the redox balance. these redox perturbations are important for coordinating changes in signaling pathways, including those of phytohormones, ros, antioxidants and cell death. the mechanisms leading to an increase in sa levels due to changes in pn levels are currently unknown. it has been suggested that sporadic cell death can lead to leakage of pns to the extracellular space, which can trigger sa biosynthesis and downstream defense signaling  <cit> . this increase in sa then leads to a buildup of ros in a feed-forward self-amplifying loop, leading to an activated sar pathway. activation of sar in turn leads to down regulation of abiotic stress signaling pathway mediated by aba. induced ros can serve as a cue to suppress sa promotive signal in the propagation of cell death  <cit> . however, the sporadic cell death in the atnudt7- <dig> mutant did not lead to confluent lesions supporting the notion that atnudt <dig> normally restricts initiation rather than propagation of cell death  <cit> . based on our studies, it is clear that atnudt <dig> is an important player linking redox metabolism and oxidative stress signaling . understanding the regulation of atnudt <dig> expression will facilitate the identification of transcription factors crucial for redox homeostasis in plants both during normal growth and under stress conditions.
