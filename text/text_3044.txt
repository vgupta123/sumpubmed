BACKGROUND
the use of microarrays has led to a significant number of exciting discoveries establishing important links between mrna expression patterns and cellular states  <cit> . mathematical and computational models have been developed to understand and characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying expression patterns  <cit> . however, it remains difficult to discover and validate novel transcription-factor binding motifs  in the human genome. the popular approach to identify tfbms utilizes sequence comparisons among co-expressed genes  <cit>  or across multi-species  <cit> . although any consensus motif can be searched among the co-regulated genes in hierarchical clusters  <cit> , this approach is not aimed to build a global model with multiple binding motifs. tfbm can be inspected through phylogenetic footprinting  <cit> , but identifying orthologous genes and their associated regulatory regions are not always possible. model-based approaches, initially developed using yeast genome  <cit> , encounter difficulty in evaluating the astronomical number of tfbm selections in the combinatorial problem  <cit> . although multiple binding motifs were selected in the yeast dataset using a recursive formula, prediction of tfbms would be affected depending on the order of selected motifs  <cit> . some models lack statistical standards for determining the number of tfbms having combinatorial roles that are critical in expression patterns. thus, a predictive model that provides a comprehensive set of tfbms still needs to be developed.

the specific aim of the current study was to devise a model for predicting known and de novo transcription factor binding motifs from array-derived mrna expression levels by developing a unique principal component analysis. we employed the responses of human chondrocytes to interleukin- <dig>  as a model system  <cit> . il- <dig> is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and it stimulates not only inflammatory responses but also tissue degeneration  <cit> . more than  <dig> microarray analyses have been conducted to analyze il-1-driven responses in various cell types, including chondrocytes  <cit> , and significant efforts have been made to understand transcriptional mechanisms of il- <dig> response  <cit> . however, few of the previous studies have validated the global roles of multiple critical tfbms in downregulation or upregulation of a cluster of genes.

in this principal component analysis, we introduced the akaike information criterion  test, singular value decomposition , and a genetic algorithm  to predict and evaluate tfbms from a pool of random dna sequences . the predictive model was formulated using state vectors, which represented a contribution of potential tfbms to the il- <dig> responses. the promoter matrix was defined to build the quantitative relationship between the mrna expression vector and the state vectors, and a unique svd procedure was applied to the promoter matrix. although one previous study defined the mrna expression level as a state variable, dynamical correlations among the mrna levels do not directly represent biological processes  <cit> . here, a state variable was defined as an activation level of each tfbm, and svd was used to link the primary components in the expression vector to the influential tfbm candidates in the state vector through the eigen gene vectors and the eigen tfbm vectors. the analytical prediction of tfbms with svd was evaluated numerically using monte carlo simulation and ga.

RESULTS
prediction and validation of novel and known tfbms were conducted using logarithmic ratios of the il-1-driven mrna alterations in human chondrocytes . first, aic was used to determine a statistically meaningful number of tfbms in the model. second, the contribution of each of the  <dig> tfbm candidates to the il- <dig> responses was evaluated by decomposing the promoter matrix with svd. third, the svd-based priority of tfbms was evaluated numerically by ga and monte-carlo simulation. fourth, a linkage was established among the predicted and known tfbms.

messenger rna ratios and aic analysis
using data obtained in primary cultures of human articular chondrocytes,  <dig> il-1-responsive genes were selected and the ratios of mrna levels from il-1-treated cells against mrna levels in untreated cells were calculated from the list of il-1-responsive genes in primary chondrocytes published by vincenti and brinckerhoff  <cit> . as shown in fig. 2a, the relative mrna levels are represented in a greyscale, and the logarithmic ratios are illustrated in a green to red color code. the mrna ratios for  <dig> genes were positive , while the ratios for  <dig> genes were negative . using eq.  and the svd procedure, these logarithmic mrna ratios were modelled against  <dig> to  <dig> tfbms that were chosen from random dna sequences of  <dig> bp in length . as expected, the model error decreased monotonically as the number of tfbms increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  in order to estimate the proper number of tfbms in the model, aic was calculated using eq.  . the minimum aic was obtained with  <dig> tfbms, which were used as models for further analysis.

svd analysis
using the svd procedure, the promoter matrix h, built from the 300-bp upstream flanking sequences, was factorized into three matrices in eq. . using the eigen gene vectors in u  and the eigen values in Λ , the observed mrna ratios were decomposed linearly with definition of the weighing factors, ki , in eq. . out of  <dig> eigen values, the primary and the secondary eigen values were  <dig>  and  <dig> . shannon entropy was calculated as  <dig>   <cit> , and the eigen values suggested a relatively even spread distribution among the  <dig> eigen gene vectors. note that that shannon entropy takes values between  <dig> and  <dig>  and a smaller value suggests that expression data are dominated by influential eigen values. using the weighing factors for each of the eigen tfbm vectors, the most influential  <dig> tfbms, whose contribution to the expression levels of il-1-responsive genes was predicted to be larger than the others, were selected. first, the eigen tfbm vectors  were derived as a complement of the eigen gene vectors. then, each tfbm candidate in the eigen tfbm vectors was weighted by the same weighting factors defined in eq. . this weighting process predicted the contributions of tfbm candidates to the observed value of z . lastly, the overall significance to the selected  <dig> genes was estimated by adding the  <dig> row elements in the eigen tfbm vectors . the predicted tfbm candidates were 5'-caggc-3', 5'-cgccc-3', 5'-ccgcc-3', 5'-caccg-3', 5'-gcgcc-3', 5'-atggg-3', 5'-gggaa-3', and 5'-ccgcg-3'.

ga analysis, monte-carlo simulation, and leave-one-out test
in order to evaluate the selection of  <dig> tfbms based on the above principal component analysis, the numerical search for tfbm candidates was conducted with the ga analysis. starting with  <dig> digital chromosomes in eq. , including the chromosome for the svd solution, the population of chromosomes was evolved for  <dig> generations. during evolution, the model error was reduced through artificial chromosome recombinations and mutations . the sum square error for the mrna ratios was  <dig>   and  <dig>  . these values were smaller than the monte-carlo results of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   using a random selection of tfbms . the ga solution reduced the error of the svd solution by  <dig> % by retaining five svd-driven tfbms and introducing three new tfbms, 5'-cgtcc-3', 5'-aaagg-3', and 5'-accca-3' .

in order to further examine the svd-based model, we conducted a leave-one-out test. in this test,  genes were used to build a model and one gene was used to validate the model through any difference between the observed and the predicted expression levels. the process was repeated n times  by removing one gene at a time. the model error for a complete set of leave-one-out tests was  <dig>  to evaluate significance of the leave-one-out model error, monte-carlo analyses were conducted using two datasets. in the first dataset the elements in the promoter matrix was reshuffled, and in the second dataset the order of mrna expression levels was randomized. the model error was  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> for the first and the second datasets, respectively .

linkage to known tfbms
the  <dig> tfbm candidates obtained from the ga analysis were graphically linked to the known tfbms . the ga-based tfbms are represented by  <dig> boxes in the first column, and each box is linked to the biologically known tfbms such as ap <dig>  sp <dig>  egr <dig>  etc. for instance, 5'-cgccc-3', one of the tfbms predicted by ga, is part of consensus sequences of sp <dig>  egr <dig>  krox, gc-box, and abi <dig> 

discussion
in this report, we have presented a predictive model and its validation using the transcriptional responses to il- <dig> in human chondrocytes as a model system. from a pool of  <dig> random dna sequences of  <dig> bp in length as potential tfbm candidates, the svd analysis and the ga simulation both identified  <dig> tfbms. five out of  <dig> tfbm candidates were identical in both analyses, and several of the known tfbms, including ap <dig>  egr <dig>  gc-box, sp <dig>  nfκb, and lef <dig>  coincided with the predicted tfbms.

prior to application to the mammalian gene expression in the current study, the described approach was examined to build a model for a ras/camp signal transduction pathway in yeast. this pathway is well characterized in yeast, and a camp responsive element , which is conserved in eukaryotes, is known to be involved. the svd-based approach with 5-bp sequences predicted a part of cre  together with two yeast-specific binding motifs such as 5'-agggg-3'  and 5'-accgg-3' . since both msn <dig> and leu <dig> are differentially expressed in response to ras activation  <cit> , the results allowed us to apply this principal component approach to the current study on the human il- <dig> responses .

in the prediction phase of tfbm analysis, we demonstrated that the svd analysis prioritized the contribution of individual tfbm candidates, and the ga algorithm was employed to evaluate independently the svd solution. svd is computationally inexpensive, and the results are reproducible since no random parameters are involved. it is straightforward to incorporate the effects of degenerate binding sequences by modifying a linear combination of the eigen tfbm vectors and adding contributions from redundant sequences in the final svd procedure. more specifically, to any tfbm candidate there are  <dig> degenerate motifs with one base-pair mismatch and the contribution of these degenerate sequences can be included in the model with an appropriate weighting factor. the standard computational complexity of svd procedure is estimated as o or o  <cit> . the complexity can be reduced to o by implementing the average algorithm or employing parallel computing  <cit> . ga is a heuristic solver suitable for searching efficiently the suboptimal solutions. there are  <dig>  ×  <dig> combinations to predict  <dig> tfbms from  <dig> candidates in this study. it is virtually impossible to evaluate all combinations, although either svd- or ga-based tfbm prediction is not globally optimal in terms of minimization of the prediction error. a predicted 5-bp tfbm can represent more than one motif longer than  <dig> bp sequences.

the use of mathematical and computational procedures such as aic, svd, and ga have been used previously to analyze the behaviour of complex biological systems  <cit> . in prediction of tfbms from the microarray data, however, the described usage here is unique in a novel state-variable representation. since many genes are regulated by multiple tfbms, a statistical standard such as aic may be used appropriately to validate the number of tfbms that are meaningful in array-derived data. the previous use of svd has been limited to clustering expression patterns in the eigen gene space  <cit> . the unique feature of the described predictive model is to link the eigen gene space to the eigen tfbm space by applying svd to the promoter matrix defined from tfbms. evolutionary algorithm such as ga has been used to estimate the values of parameters  <cit> . we employed ga to select the set of tfbms from an artificial chromosome that is composed of on/off switches for  <dig> random dna sequences.

the predictive model in this study generated many testable hypotheses on known tfbms, as well as novel tfbm candidates, and led us to the analysis of transcription factors. five out of the  <dig> tfbm candidates were linked to known transcription factors. among them, ap <dig> is known to be involved in stress responses  <cit>  and lef <dig> is known to be involved in a wnt signalling pathway  <cit> . however, neither ap <dig> nor lef <dig> is reported to be responsive to il- <dig>  egr <dig> increases expression of inflammatory cytokines and is involved in il-1-induced downregulation of the type ii collagen promoter in chondrocytes  <cit> , and the gc-box is a widely distributed promoter component. the binding site of sp <dig> is recognized by sp <dig>  which may oppose positive effects of sp <dig>  <cit> . nfκb is a pivotal transcription factor that is both induced at the mrna level, as shown here, and activated by proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . however, the relatively long degenerate consensus sequence of its binding site 5'-gggtcc-3'requires a further linkage analysis to the predicted tfbm of 5'-gggaa-3'. in a separate study, the promoter competition assay was conducted to evaluate the role of the svd-selected tfbms using three il-1-responsive genes, lif, nfκb <dig>  and irf <dig>  <cit> . in the assay, the stimulatory effects of 5'-caggc-3' and 5'-cgccc-3', as well as the inhibitory effects of 5'-ccgcc-3', 5'-caccg-3', and 5'-gcgcc-3', were consistent to the svd prediction. in order to further validate the stimulatory role of 5'-caggc-3', a gel shift assay was conducted. as predicted, incubation with the nuclear extracts isolated from the il-1-treated cells retarded the mobility of the dna fragment containing 5'-caggc-3' .

the described state-variable formulation of the predictive model can be extended to include redundancy in tfbm consensus sequences, temporal mrna profiles, and interactions of tfbms with transcription factors and cofactors. short motifs such as  <dig> bp tfbms in this study may present less specificity, but the described svd procedure can increase specificity easier than any combinatorial search algorithm such as ga. the model can be extended to predict a dynamical state of tfbms associated with the regulation of the temporal mrna expression profiles  <cit> . interactions among tfbms through transcription factors and cofactors can be implemented through the nonlinear version  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
identification of tfbms in the human genome is critically important in the post human genome project era  <cit> . although experimental evaluation is mandatory to gain biological insights from the model-based predictive results, an analytical model at nearly no computational cost would be useful to provide initial conditions for numerical optimization or predict a set of potential targets for experimental verification. although the prediction is dependent on definition of regulatory regions, the described model-based analysis allowed us to gain a new biochemical insight on the il- <dig> responses by integrating the svd procedure and akaike information criterion. in conclusion, the current study on gene responses to il- <dig> demonstrates that application of the primary component analysis would predict and validate the novel and known tfbms from the microarray data using genomic dna information.
