BACKGROUND
in spite of evolutionary divergence and the pressures of domestication, there has been a noticeable conservation of genetic synteny between related plant species, e.g. within the gramineae and the brassicae. there has been considerable interest in defining these interrelationships, from the angles of both evolutionary genetics and plant breeding  <cit> . rapidly accumulating data from plant genome sequencing and comparative genetic mapping have led to new resources for accessing and displaying these data sets   <cit> , the arabidopsis information resource   <cit> , the brassica genome gateway  <cit> . one limitation of the current state of knowledge in plant genetics is that the physically ordered complete genome sequence is only available for rice  and arabidopsis thaliana, both of which have relatively small genomes. rapid progress is being made for some other species, particularly maize   <cit> ). however, feasible approaches for the sequencing and physical mapping of the larger genome poaceae species, including the cereals wheat  and barley  and the forage and amenity ryegrasses  and fescues , are still in the process of development  <cit> . until more progress is made in the whole genome analysis of these latter species, comparative studies will continue to be of great use in transferring information from the model species to the crop species. typically, whole genome comparative studies are based upon the identification of genetic synteny between a model and crop species by either reference to existing sources or the development of de novo markers which target particular areas of a genome . in the present study a variation on the whole genome angle has been developed in which, using rice as an anchor, dna sequence databases based upon both cdna transcripts and methylation-filtration  <cit>  obtained from both monocot and dicot crop and model species  have been aligned with the annotated rice pseudomolecules. this makes it possible to establish an overall picture of gene similarities between a number of different species and the rice genome.

RESULTS
using megablast with parameters of wordsize  =  <dig> and expectation  =  <dig> × 10- <dig> identified significant alignments with between 7%  and 45%  of the all tigr rice loci  . subdividing the trl database on the basis of annotation and pseudomolecule origin identified marked differences in the percentage of alignments within the different subdivisions . for all the databases, the largest percentage of alignments was identified for functionally annotated, expressed  trl . the smallest number of alignments was identified in the hypothetical protein subdivision . these differences in the percentages of significant alignments coincided with differences in the physical distribution of the different types of trl annotations . for each rice pseudomolecule the overall physical distribution of the trl with functional annotations and the expressed proteins was distinguishable from the that of the hypothetical proteins and retro/transposon-related trl. the distributions of the latter groups were loosely centred around the centromeres, whereas the former groups tended to be distributed away from the centromeres. the alignments established with the databases from the other species mimicked the distribution of the trl with functional annotations and expressed proteins. on the basis of pseudomolecule origin, rice trl derived from c <dig> generally had a higher percentage of alignments than those derived from the other pseudomolecules and trl derived from c <dig> the lowest. this trend, in terms of percentages of alignments/pseudomolecule, was generally consistent across the different subdivisions of trl and, particularly, the monocot plant databases . an exception was the lp_mf database, where the alignments from c <dig> and c <dig> were more or less equivalent.

tigr rice loci  with expressed functional annotations  consistently generated the highest number of megablast alignments . consequently these were considered likely to contain the most reliable gene predictions and further analyses were focussed on this set of  <dig> gene models from the rice os_cd database. figure  <dig> illustrates how the faexptrl are not evenly distributed throughout the rice genome and while figure  <dig> does not represent the direct physical distribution within each rice chromosome, it does reflect it. so, rather than using rice physical distances, in order to look at the patterns of alignments and their associated megablast scores, comparisons were made using linear 10% divisions of the faexptrl  and moving windows of  <dig> consecutive faexptrl  for each pseudomolecule .

in comparing the results of the different test databases, the numbers of significant alignments and the scores associated with these alignments in each linear 10% of faexptrl for each pseudomolecule  do not appear to be random, as indicated by the significant rank correlations ; i.e., the number of significant alignments identified for one test database for one pseudomolecule linear 10% segment is a positive indicator of the number of alignments one will expect to find in the other test databases. this is also true for comparisons between scores generated for the different test databases and for comparisons between numbers of alignments and scores  . this trend can be illustrated using the mw approach  which shows 'hot'  and 'cold'  spots relating to relative numbers of significant alignments and their scores – particularly for the four monocot test databases. notably, faexptrl on pm <dig> were aligned more frequently and those from pm <dig> and pm <dig> less frequently than faexptrl from the other pseudomolecules  , though there is considerable local variation which is consistent particularly across the  <dig> monocot test databases. on most pseudomolecules, cold-spots were associated with the pericentromeric region, but were not exclusive to these regions.

significant correlations between the number of segmentally duplicated faexptrl and % alignments/linear10% of each pseudomolecule  indicated that there was a positive association between these measures. illustrated in the form of mws  it can be seen that regions where there are hot-spots or cold-spots for segmentally duplicated faexptrl also tend to be hot-spots or cold-spots for % alignments. particular exceptions to this are on pm <dig> and pm <dig> where there are high concentrations of duplicated faexptrl but fewer alignments .

megablast searches of the  <dig> faexptrl present in the highest 10% mws  , which had significant alignments with all the monocot test databases, identified a total of  <dig> arabidopsis gene models in the at_cd database . by searching the genevestigator® meta-analyzer database with these gene models, the expression profiles of  <dig> faexp arabidopsis gene models were obtained for both growth stage and plant organs, and the stage and organ of maximal expression were identified. the maximal expression profiles for these arabidopsis gene models are compared with a random sample of  <dig> faexp arabidopsis gene models in tables  <dig> and  <dig>

discussion
it is well established that the physical and genetic order of markers and genes from one species can be reflected by similar orders or partial orders in a different species ; a major goal of comparative plant genomics is to enable detailed analyses of these kinds to take place. it is also well established that detailed individual sequence alignments  are informative in terms of establishing sequence similarities on a gene by gene basis. in contrast to these two approaches, this present study does not seek to comment directly on syntenic relationships between different plant species or to describe precise homologues or orthologues of individual genes. additionally, it differs from other analyses in that the basic unit used is not a gene or a measure of physical, cytogenetic or genetic distance, but a unit of linearly ordered 'reliable' gene models for each pseudomolecule .

six different databases, derived from  <dig> monocot species and  <dig> dicot species and generated either from expressed sequences or through methylation-filtered genomic dna isolation, were tested against the os_cd database. in the absence of the complete sequence of any genome there will always be limitations and unknowns in the degree of representation present in a given database. additionally, the stringency of the cut-off threshold for reporting a significant alignment will, obviously, affect the outcome . megablast wordsizes of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were tested with the lp_mf database and these identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 16% of the functionally annotated trl, respectively. however, while the relative numbers of significant alignments identified was affected by altering the wordsize, the relative proportions of alignments between the different pseudomolecules stayed, more or less, the same . consequently, the relatively permissive w =  <dig> was maintained in order to facilitate the identification of alignments, particularly in the context of searches of genomic  databases against a database  which consists of predicted coding sequences.

there was clearly variation between the different test databases in the degree of coverage of the rice genome – particularly, and more obviously understandably, between the monocot and dicot databases, but also between the lp_mf database and the other monocot databases. when compared directly with the other methylation-filtered database, while both the lp_mf and zm_mf databases contained similar numbers of sequences  the average sequence length for zm_mf was  <dig> bp as compared to  <dig> for lp_mf. additionally, 27% of the zm_mf sequences were aligned with at least  <dig> trl whereas the equivalent figure for the lp_mf database was only 11%. these differences in the number of alignments identified between the lp_mf database and the zm_mf database probably relate more to the relative proportions and lengths of coding sequences present in the database than to sequence divergence between rice and ryegrass as compared to rice and maize.

the most striking aspect of the results presented here is the positional consistency of the similarities, in terms of identified alignments, between all the test databases – indicating that it is not just a consequence of random differences in sampling between the databases. this does not only apply to the monocot databases, but also to the dicot databases  in spite of the relatively low number of overall alignments derived from the latter . these positional relationships can even be seen at the level of the whole pseudomolecule: even though the magnitudes of the differences are not necessarily considerable, pm <dig> consistently has the lowest number of alignments with the other databases and pm <dig>  consistently has the highest number of alignments  . additionally, the average quality of alignments  above the cut-off threshold also show positional similarities . however, this is less consistent in terms of the mws, chiefly because individual high scores can have a disproportionate effect on the overall average . assuming an ancestral monocot genome  <cit> , the similarity of trends between the  <dig> monocot test databases and the rice os_cd database would seem to indicate that there are positional differences in the rice genome in the rates at which coding sequences  evolve. most notably, but not exclusively, pm <dig> seems to contain many coding regions of the rice genome that have been relatively well conserved  with the other monocots tested. conversely, pm <dig> and pm <dig> seem to contain many regions of the rice genome where the sequences of coding regions are less well conserved. these differences can, in part, be related to the relative distributions of faexptrl with unique annotations as opposed to faexptrl derived from large gene families  . this observation must, however, be treated with caution due to the untested biological relevance of many annotations. possibly, hot-spots represent genic regions of rice which have a more generalised function and cold-spots represent genic regions with more rice-specific functions. this is not to say that the homologues or orthologues of the genes present in rice on pm <dig> and pm <dig> and other cold-spots are absent from the other monocots – but it does suggest a greater degree of dna coding sequence differences and so possible divergence in structure and function of the protein products from those regions of the genome. this may have implications in terms of using rice as a template for gene discovery and gene function prediction in the larger genome monocots.

there are few obvious differences between the  <dig> monocot test species in terms of the heat map patterns, though ryegrass is probably the most distinct. bearing in mind the lower apparent coverage of the rice genome present in the lp_mf database relative to the zm_mf/ta and hv_ta databases, the hot-spots on pm <dig> and pm <dig> are less intense for ryegrass than they are for maize and barley . however, the hot-spots on pm <dig> seem to be more intense for lp_mf than for the other monocot databases. this would not be expected if it was just an artefact of the relative coverages of the different database. the relative number of hot-spots identified for pm <dig> in the lp_mf database is particularly interesting in the context of the high degree of conservation of genetic synteny that has been established between rice chromosome  <dig> and ryegrass/fescue  chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

in this analysis, there were  <dig> faexptrl from pm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which were in the top 10%  for the average monocot % alignment category and which also had significant alignments with all  <dig> monocot test databases . in comparison, there were  <dig> different faexptrl from pm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which were in the bottom 10%  for the average monocot % alignment category and which also had no significant alignments with any of the  <dig> monocot test databases. while it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the presence or absence of specific genes from either grouping, it is possible to look at the representation of large gene families  within these top and bottom 10% groupings. table  <dig> details that, of the  <dig> gene families which are represented >  <dig> times within the entire set of faexptrl,  <dig> out of the largest  <dig> families  family proteins, expressed; nb-arc domain containing proteins, expressed) seem to be over-represented in the bottom 10%. three of these are also under-represented in the top 10% when compared to the overall average representation. functionally, there is likely to be a degree of overlap between members of some of these families in that many f-box and nb-arc domain containing proteins can also contain lrrs and kinase domains  <cit> . clearly, these families are annotated on the basis of the presence of particular predicted structural motifs in the proteins, rather than by a well-developed knowledge of their precise functions. however, lrr and nb-arc domain containing proteins are often associated with disease resistance and the hypersensitive response  <cit>  and f-box proteins are associated with ubiquitin-targeting of proteins prior to degradation  <cit> , therefore it is possible that the bottom 10% are enriched for genes with a rice-specific response to environmental challenges. in contrast, pentatricopeptide containing proteins are associated with plant organellar nucleotide metabolism and there is no inherent necessity for a rice-specific response  <cit> . more generally, within large gene families a degree of similarity in protein structure may allow for a degree of redundancy in protein function. this in turn would lead to a lessening of the relative degree of sequence homology in certain members of these gene families as species underwent divergent evolution .

a further question concerns whether there might be a biological basis associated with the observed heat-map patterns generated from the comparative alignment scores . to begin to address this, two further analyses were carried out relating to: a) possible expression patterns associated with faexptrl from the top10%  regions and b) the relation of the heat-map patterns generated from comparative alignments with that generated for segmentally duplicated faexptrl.

megablast identified  <dig> faexp arabidopsis gene models  in the at_cd database with significant similarities to faexptrl and present in the top 10%  average monocot % alignment category. considering just the plant organs  or growth stages  in which the faexp arabidopsis gene models were maximally expressed, when these were compared to a randomly selected set of faexp arabidopsis gene models there were some differences between the two samples in terms of the maximal expression profiles. in terms of the plant organs, the six types that appeared more frequently  in the top 10% group, as opposed to the control group, could all be associated directly or indirectly with meristematic cell division. lateral root cap and callus tissue were particularly striking in this respect. for growth stage, those associated with germination and the initiation of floral development were represented more strongly in the top 10% group than in the control. no comparison could be made with faexptrl present in the bottom 10% as, by definition of the megablast discrimination used in this study, these were not represented within the at_cd database. there is an indication, from both the annotation comparisons and the maximal expression profile comparisons, that some genes within hot- and cold-spots may have a degree of diverged functionality. in support of this principle, growth stage differences in the overall transcription patterns between euchromatin and heterochromatin in rice have been noted previously for chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . similarly, in the present study, there is a general association of cold spots and hot-spots with regions of the pseudomoleules with higher and lower concentrations, respectively, of retro/transposon related sequences . this indicates that there is a hot-spot/euchromatin, cold spot/heterochromatin association. however, one must be extremely wary of over-interpretation and clarification of this will have to await further investigation.

there has been a considerable amount of genome duplication in the development of the modern-day rice genome, principally through ancestral polyploidisation, but also involving more recent duplications  <cit>   and the consequences of gene duplication and the fates of such genes has been the topic of recent interest  <cit> . genome duplication by polyploidisation in the modern rice progenitor is considered to have occurred c.  <dig> million years ago, before the divergence of the poaceae cereal and grass genomes, and to have been followed by a diploidisation process involving large-scale chromosome rearrangement and deletion  <cit> . in this study, when the positions of segmentally duplicated regions of the rice genome were related to % sequence alignments within linear 10% faexptrl pm segments, there was found to be a positive correlation for all of the test databases . this relationship, illustrated in the equivalent mws in figure  <dig>  indicates that the presence of hot-spots for segmentally duplicated faexptrl is usually associated with the presence of hot-spots for % alignments. it has been reported that paralogous gene pairs produced from whole genome duplications evolve more slowly than singletons  <cit>  and the association of segmentally duplicated and % alignment faexptrl hot-spots is consistent with this. models have been proposed as to why the conservation of both paralogous genes resulting from a duplication event might be maintained over evolutionary time. one such model posits subfunctionalisation, in which the combined activities of paralogous genes maintain the function of their single common ancestor, though neither paralog, separately, maintains the complete original function  <cit> . it is also proposed that paralogs might provide protection against deleterious mutations in dosage sensitive genes, particularly those with significant roles in interactive gene networks  <cit> . it could be conjectured that the hot-spots in this study represent the physical position in the rice genome of plant genes which require more precise conservation of sequence in order to maintain their functional integrity. if so, where these regions of the genome have been duplicated, there may be an evolutionary advantage in maintaining the duplications, either through necessity developed after the duplication, as implied by subfunctionalisation, or through 'buffering by dosage' against deleterious mutations. the converse argument might be that within cold-spots more rapid sequence evolution might be driven by the development of rice-specific adaptation . exceptions to this general trend are the duplicated terminal segments on pm <dig> and pm <dig>  which are relative cold-spots. however, as these are more recent duplications  and of a limited scale  the situation may not be fully analogous  <cit> . leaving pm <dig> and pm <dig> aside, over an evolutionary timescale, processes active in the maintenance of paralogous genes would be expected to work at the level of the gene and not on a region of a chromosome, as suggested by the correlations and heat-maps presented here. indeed, within the duplicated segments there is also an indication that the actual faexptrl by which the segmental duplications are recognised show a greater degree of sequence conservation, in terms of numbers of alignments with the different plant databases, than the faexptrl for which no duplication is recognised . however, this trend is not reflected in relatively higher megablast scores for these sequences and is also complicated by uncertainty in defining the precise starts and ends of duplicated segments and the presence of, apparently, multiply duplicated segments. it is also possible that, if one of the main processes driving the retention of paralogs is their potential significance in the maintenance of dosage sensitive gene networks  <cit> , then what is being reflected in the heat maps is the physical association in chromosomal regions of genes interrelated through their metabolic functions.

the complete sequence of the rice genome and the rapid development in the complete sequencing of the maize and brachypodium distachyon genomes are new resources for developing evolutionary models for monocots. additionally, they represent invaluable tools for increasing our understanding of the structure and function of the larger grass and cereal genomes of the poaceae. technologies are still in development that will enable the efficient and accurate complete sequencing, reconstruction and annotation of these large grass and cereal genomes. until these are established, comparative genome analysis will remain the underpinning, unifying approach to understanding the evolutionary  mechanisms that have led to the modern day plant genome. the present study has developed an approach to identifying and illustrating similarities and differences between coding sequences related to the physical position rice of putative orthologous gene models. it has thus contributed to the developing understanding of the internal structure of plant genomes and their interrelationships.

CONCLUSIONS
comparisons of patterns of rice pseudomolecule-anchored sequence alignments between rice faexptrl and transcript-assembly and methylation-filtered databases from other plant species indicated that the relative numbers of alignments were not-randomly distributed throughout the rice genome; rank correlations between relative physical position in rice and % aligned sequences were positive and significant for all the plant species . when the relationships were illustrated using heat-maps of colour coded moving average windows of % alignments/queried database/ <dig> faexptrl  it became apparent that particular pseudomolecules and regions within pseudomolecules contained faexptrl which were relatively more  or less  conserved than other pseudomolecules. the observed patterns were consistent  across comparisons with different plant species. furthermore, when a comparison of the relative positions of ancestrally segmentally duplicated regions of the rice genome was made with the relative numbers of percentage alignments with the test databases, the two were found to be co-incident in terms of both positive, significant correlations  and heat-maps . analysis of the nature of the genes present in hot-spots and cold-spots, inferred from the published annotations, indicated that pm <dig> and pm <dig> were enriched for faexptrl with unique annotations and those contained within large gene families, respectively. additionally, members of certain of the large gene families, particularly f-box, lrr and nb-arc domain containing proteins were under-represented in the hot-spots and over-represented in cold-spots . maximal expression patterns of arabidopsis 'orthologues' of faexptrl present in hot-spots showed a slight enrichment for tissues directly associated with meristematic cell division  and for growth stages associated with germination and floral initiation . while, the evidence from these results alone is insufficient to conclude that hot-spots and cold-spots reflect the presence of different gene types and processes, for instance rice-specific or non-specific gene activities and networks, further investigation is warranted. as comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic resources become available for more plant species, these investigations will be facilitated.
