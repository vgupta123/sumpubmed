BACKGROUND
tomato  is an important fruit crop and a model system in plants. the basic chromosome number of tomato is 2n =  <dig>  and wild forms range from diploids to hexaploids  <cit> . the genome of the tomato was recently published; it possesses about  <dig>  genes, a rich resource to be studied by scientists  <cit> .

the hormone abscisic acid  regulates numerous developmental and functional processes, including stomatal aperture and hydraulic conductivity, seed dormancy, a key phase transitions throughout the plant lifecycle . an important role of aba in a variety of plants is to increase tolerance to stresses such as drought, salinity, cold, and heat . aba was recognized as an important signaling molecule that can trigger signaling and regulating mechanisms to cope with adverse stresses. under drought conditions, plants synthesize and redistribute aba, leading to guard cell responses that close stomata, thereby reducing plant water loss  <cit> . research in chickpea  has shown that aba can improve cold tolerance by, in part, improving the water status of leaves and anti-oxidative ability and can enhance heat tolerance via the accumulation of osmoprotectants  <cit> . rice  seeds pretreated with aba had improved salt-tolerance, with lower na+ and cl– levels and na+/k+ ratio as well as higher k+ and ca2+ concentrations, proline accumulation, soluble sugar content, and grain yield  <cit> .

mounting evidence suggests that aba plays contrasting roles during defense responses to pathogens  <cit> . it interfered at multiple levels with pathogen stress signaling and suppressed or promoted phenylalanine ammonia lyase  activity  <cit> . the different plant species assayed in these studies can account, in part, for the various observed effects of aba on pathogen resistance. aba is associated predominantly with pathogen susceptibility in tomato, but both negative and positive effects were reported in arabidopsis <cit> . moreover, the synergistic or antagonistic roll of aba in disease resistance is universally acknowledged to depend on the type of pathogen, its specific way of entering the host, the timing of the defense response, and the type of tissue affected, as well as the concentration of aba  <cit> . aba responses during biotic and abiotic stresses primarily affect levels of gene expression  <cit> . aba-induced genes mainly encoded proteins associated with dehydrins and enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species, enzymes of compatible solute metabolism, a variety of transporters, regulatory proteins such as transcription factors , protein kinases and phosphatases, and enzymes involved in phospholipid signaling. aba-repressed genes usually encode proteins that are associated with growth, including cell wall, ribosomal, plasma membrane, and chloroplast proteins  <cit> .

to comprehensively understand the functions of aba and related genes, high-throughput screening techniques have proven quite effective . matsui et al.  completed an arabidopsis transcriptome analysis after  <dig> and 10 h of drought, cold, high-salinity, and aba-treatment conditions using a tiling array, and the results indicated that approximately 16% of the genes in the transcriptomic library were significantly regulated by aba. in addition, there was greater crosstalk between aba and drought and high-salinity stress signaling processes than between aba- and cold-stress signaling. similar results were discovered in expression profiles of rice genes under various stresses and aba application using a cdna microarray and rna gel-blot analyses  <cit> . the impact of aba on gene expression far exceeds that of other plant hormones. about  <dig>  genes detected by microarray were significantly regulated by aba in arabidopsis seedlings; this number was twice and  <dig> times as many genes as were influenced by methyl jasmonate and gibberellin, respectively  <cit> .

with the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technology, rna deep-sequencing  becomes more efficient and less expensive  <cit> . the results of rna-seq are highly reproducible, both technically and biologically  <cit> . in recent years, numerous transcriptome data sets have been produced, made publicly available, and reanalyzed by other researchers. however, so far, few rna-seq analyses of the genome-wide responses of genes to aba in plants have been reported.

we investigated aba responses in tomato, and here report the results of a comparative transcriptome analysis of exogenous aba-treated tomato leaves using rna-seq technology. the goals were to  construct a tomato leaf transcriptome;  compare and analyze the transcripts in control and aba-treated plants; and  gain insight into stress tolerance and pathogen-resistance induced by aba in tomato. this study presents the transcriptome of tomato leaves responding to aba and provides a genetic resource that can be used for crop improvement.

RESULTS
global transcriptome analysis
tomato seedling sprayed with  <dig>  μmol l- <dig> aba solution were chosen to study aba responses. twenty-four hours later, the young third leaves of randomly-selected plants from both the aba-treated and control groups were collected, labeled as a1d  and c1d , respectively. the tomato aba/control rna samples were used for deep sequencing on an illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. each read in the solexa paired-end  sequencing was 101 bp in length. sequencing generated  <dig>  million reads, a total raw dataset of  <dig>  gb. after trimming,  <dig>  million clean reads remained, corresponding to  <dig>  gb clean data. the dataset of each sample, including c1d and a1d, was represented by over  <dig> million reads, a read density sufficient for the subsequent quantitative analysis of genes. the sequence reads were aligned to the tomato reference genome using soapaligner/soap <dig> software , allowing two base mismatches  <cit> . of the total reads,  <dig> % matched either to a unique  or to multiple  genomic locations .table  <dig> 
number of reads sequenced and mapped to the tomato genome


*the number of unique mapping reads plus multimapping reads equals the total number of total alignments.



after aligning and assembling,  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  transcripts were identified in the transcriptome. of those spliced transcripts,  <dig>   matched completely with the annotated tomato genome,  <dig>   were potentially novel isoforms,  <dig>   were unknown or intergenic transcripts, and  <dig>   mapped to the complementary strand of an annotated gene. these results suggested that some transcripts were probably generated from alternative mrna splicing or were new transcripts.

the genes and transcripts resulting from illumina sequencing were merged with the annotated reference genome to generate  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  transcripts using cuffmerge  <cit> . we removed transcripts with lengths less than 150 bp, and the remaining  <dig>  transcripts , corresponding to  <dig>  genes, were used for functional annotation and expression profiling in each sample. transcripts of length 150–200 bp accounted for  <dig> % of the total, those 200–600 bp for  <dig> %, those 600–1000 bp for  <dig> %, those 1000–1600 bp for  <dig> %, those 1600–2200 bp for  <dig> %, those 2200–3000 bp for  <dig> %, and those >3000 bp for  <dig> %, as shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

annotation, functional classification, and kegg analysis of all detected transcripts
of the  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>   possessed open reading frames , while orfs in the other  <dig>   were not predicted . of all transcripts,  <dig>  were described in the tomato genome, and  <dig>  had homologs in the ncbi non-redundant  protein database. many of these genes were reported to respond to drought, cold, high salinity, or aba, and included both regulatory and functional proteins. transcription factors  were the largest group of regulatory proteins . this result was consistent with the previous reports in arabidopsis and rice using microarray and tiling arrays analysis  <cit> .

for the global functional analysis, all identified tomato transcripts were classified into different functional categories using blast2go   <cit> . a total of  <dig>  transcripts could be annotated in gene ontology  and were classified into  <dig> functional groups, including  <dig> groups in biological process,  <dig> in cellular component, and  <dig> in molecular function . within biological process, “metabolic process”  with  <dig>  transcripts and “cellular process”  with  <dig>  transcripts were predominant. in the category of cellular component, the three main groups were “cell” , “organelle”  and “cell part” . the categories “binding”  and “catalytic activity”  were most common in molecular function, represented by  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts, respectively.figure  <dig> 
gene ontology  functional annotation of transcripts. all  <dig>  transcripts were assigned to at least one go term and were grouped into three main go categories and  <dig> groups,  <dig> groups in biological process,  <dig> in cellular component, and  <dig> in molecular function. the right-hand y-axis represents the number of genes in a sub-category. the left-hand y-axis indicates the percentage of a specific sub-category of genes in each main category.



all detected transcripts were blasted to string  <dig>  for further annotation based on cluster of orthologous groups  of protein categories. a total of  <dig>  transcripts with cog annotations were grouped into  <dig> functional categories. the largest category was “general function prediction only” , following by “transcription” , “replication, recombination and repair” , and “signal transduction mechanisms” . in addition, only  <dig>  cog annotations belonged to the “function unknown” category .figure  <dig> 
function classification in clusters of orthologous groups of proteins . all transcripts were aligned to the cog database to predict possible functions. a total of  <dig>  putative proteins were functionally classified into  <dig> groups. capital letters on the x-axis indicate the cog categories as listed on the right of the histogram, and the y-axis indicates the number of transcripts.



kegg annotation results were retrieved from kegg database based on sequence similarity, and  <dig>  transcripts were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the pathways most strongly represented were “metabolic pathways” , “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” , followed by “ribosome” , “plant hormone signal transduction” , “starch and sucrose metabolism” , and “plant-pathogen interaction”  .

analysis of expressed genes
in total,  <dig>   transcripts expressed in the tomato leaf transcriptome , including  <dig>  in c1d and  <dig>  in a1d, respectively. there were  <dig>  transcripts expressed only in the aba-treated group ,  <dig>  transcripts expressed only in the control group , and  <dig>  transcripts expressed in both libraries, which indicated that aba may activate or repress a fraction of unique transcripts.

based on expression level, the transcripts were divided into five groups . the group with expression levels of 1– <dig> fpkm  was largest, representing  <dig> % of all transcripts, while those with expression levels of < <dig> fpkm accounted for  <dig> %, those with 10– <dig> fpkm  <dig> %, those with 100– <dig> fpkm  <dig> %, and those with > <dig> fpkm only  <dig> %. among all expressed transcripts,  <dig>  showed no changes in expression levels | <  <dig> ). the expressions of  <dig>   transcripts were altered by exogenous aba  . of the transcripts with altered expression,  <dig>   were significantly changed  <  <dig> ) and labeled differentially expressed genes , including  <dig>  that were up-regulated and  <dig> that were down-regulated . among the degs, there were more up-regulated transcripts than down-regulated ones, indicating that many genes responded positively to aba treatment. this result was similar to those reported in previous studies in arabidopsis and rice .table  <dig> 
number of expressed transcripts in control  and aba-treated  libraries

differential expression analysis of all transcripts in the control  and aba-treatment  libraries. transcripts that differed by less than 20%  were assumed to not change in expression level. transcripts that satisfied the conditions of “fdr <  <dig> ” and “|log <dig> fold-change | ≥1” were considered significantly differentially-expressed genes . other transcripts are noted as “up-regulated slightly” or “down-regulated slightly”.



molecular functional classification based on go was also performed on the  <dig>  degs. the up- and down-regulated degs annotated in go were grouped into  <dig> and  <dig> groups on go.level <dig>  respectively  and into ten classes on go.level <dig>  the most common categories were “catalytic activity”  and “binding” , followed by “transmembrane transporter activity”, “substrate-specific transporter activity”, “transcription factor activity”, “translation factor activity”, and “signal transducer activity”.

genes related to aba signaling transduction
the aba signaling transduction pathway mainly includes four core regulatory components: aba receptor/pyrabactin resistance protein1/pyr-like protein , protein phosphatases type 2c , the sucrose nonfermenting1-related protein kinase  <dig>  and aba responsive element binding factors   <cit> . in the tomato transcriptome,  <dig> pyls,  <dig> pp2cs,  <dig> snrk2s, and  <dig> abfs were identified .table  <dig> 
genes related to aba signaling pathway and transcription factors in tomato transcriptome


rcars/pyr1/pyls, regulatory components of aba receptor/pyrabactin resistance protein1/pyr-like proteins; pp2cs, type 2c protein phosphatases; snrk <dig>  sucrose nonfermenting1–related protein kinase 2; abf, aba responsive element binding factors; abrt, aba responsive transcription factor; bzip, basic leucine zipper transcription factor; dreb, dehydration responsive element binding protein; bhlh, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor; myb, myeloblastosis oncogene; myc, myelocytomatosis oncogene transcription factor; ap2/erf, apetala 2/ethylene-responsive element-binding factor; nac, no apical meristem/ataf/cup-shaped cotyledons; hsf, heat shock factor.



the discovery of pyr/pyl/rcar receptors in these samples greatly advances the understanding of the aba signaling pathway. among  <dig> pyls in the tomato transcriptome, the expression level of eight did not differ  in aba treatment compared with control. the other  <dig> pyls showed slight differences in their transcript abundance, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold, with five up-regulated and five down-regulated genes. two up-regulated pyls showed moderate transcript level differences . the other eight differentially-expressed pyls were found at low abundances . the results indicated that exogenous aba had a slight impact on pyl expression because the aba-mediated signaling cascade is initiated by the perception of aba receptors  <cit> . the slight change in upstream aba-receptor gene expression could initiate responses in a series of downstream genes. rcars/pyr1/pyls were recently found to comprise  <dig> members in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . all pyl family members are aba-binding proteins and that regulate the target pp2cs in a combinatorial manner  <cit> . however, we detected  <dig> pyl members in this tomato transcriptome, enriching the pyl receptor gene family.

among the  <dig> pp2cs in this study,  <dig> transcripts changed their expression levels , treated by aba, including five that were up-regulated and eight that were down-regulated. of them, only one transcript with low levels  was significantly higher than the control by  <dig> -fold . three pp2cs showed significantly decreased expression in aba-treatment  by  <dig> -fold ,  <dig> -fold , and  <dig> -fold . the result agreed with the previous reports that pp2cs were negative regulators of aba signaling  <cit> . in the absence of aba, pyr/pyl/rcars are not bound to pp2cs, and pp2c activity is high, which prevents snrk <dig> activation. in the presence of aba, the combination of aba and pyr/pyl/rcars bind to and inhibit pp2cs, which allows the accumulation of phosphorylated snrk2s and subsequent phosphorylation of abfs  <cit> .

among the  <dig> snrk <dig> transcripts, five differed slightly in level compared with control. of them, one showed increased expression  and four showed decreased expression . although tcons_ <dig> had moderate transcript abundance , the other three down-regulated snrk2s were expressed at low levels . snrk2s are categorized into subclasses i, ii and iii. subclass i members are not activated by aba, and subclass ii and iii members are weakly and strongly activated by aba, respectively  <cit> . among  <dig> snrk <dig> members in arabidopsis and rice, sapk <dig>  sapk <dig>  and sapk <dig> were in subclass iii, and sapk <dig> to sapk <dig> were in subclass i and ii  <cit> . in this transcriptome, the only induced snrk <dig>  that was annotated as serine/threonine protein kinase sapk8-like protein was of subclass iii. the other four repressed snrk2s were possibly sapk <dig>  sapk <dig>  or sapk <dig> based on their ncbi blastx matches. kobayashi et al.  demonstrated that only three snrk <dig> family members were activated by aba but all were activated by hyperosmotic stress, and there were no members activated only by aba. this study also suggested that a small percentage of snrk2s participated in the signaling transduction under exogenous aba stress.

in the  <dig> abfs, seven were up-regulated and three were down-regulated. tcons_ <dig>  and tcons_ <dig>  were significantly altered. this result indicated that abfs were mainly positive regulators of aba response. the members of the abf gene family belongs to a subfamily of bzip tfs  <cit> . most abfs are known induced in vegetative tissue under drought stress and aba treatment in arabidopsis <cit> . however, in the transcriptome, abfs were expressed at low levels in both libraries, so transcription regulator factors may target a cascade action  <cit> .

overall, these results agreed with what is known of the aba regulation pathway  <cit> . thus exogenous aba can activate the signaling pathway, and it affected pyls, pp2cs and snrk2s, and abfs. moreover, members of these gene families had different responses to aba, indicating that they probably played positive or negative regulatory roles in the aba pathway. furthermore, many genes in these families had no differences in expression abundance, implying that there exists functional redundancy in the aba pathway or that these genes participate in an aba-independent pathway  <cit> .

transcription factors induced by aba
with respect to tfs, the results of this study supported those of previous research. the tf families of bzip , bhlh , myb , ap2/erf , nac , and wrky  were identified in this study. moreover,  <dig> heat shock factors  and  <dig> mads-boxes were also detected . in the bzip family, aba-responsive tf  and bzip  were two subgroups. dehydration-responsive element-binding protein  and bhlh  belonged to the bhlh family. the myb family included myb  and myc . the ap <dig> family was divided into three subgroups, including ap <dig> , ap2/erf domain-containing tf , and rav <dig> . reportedly, the most common classes of regulatory sequences induced by aba are the g-box abres recognized by members of the bzip family, and many aba-regulated genes also contain binding sites for proteins of the myb and myc families. nac, wrky, bhlh, and zn-finger classes were also found to participate in some aba responses  <cit> .

although tfs were up-regulated after aba treatment, they had low abundances in both libraries  . the tfs interacted with cis-elements in the promoter regions of several responsive genes and thus control the expressions of many downstream genes, triggering cascade reactions of many physiological processes and controlling biochemical reactions in plant cells  <cit> . thus, a slight alteration in the transcript abundance of tfs can result in a substantial change in downstream gene expression and physiological responses. therefore, although in this tomato transcriptome aba affected tfs with low transcript abundances, the potential results cannot be neglected. exceptionally, dehydration-responsive element binding proteins  that bind to drought-response elements  cis-elements were substantially down-regulated . reportedly, most drebs are independent of aba  <cit> .

genes related to heat shock protein 
heat shock proteins , including hsp70s, hsp90s, hsp100s, hsp60s , and small heat-shock proteins , are stress-responsive proteins that function as molecular chaperones, protecting plants from damage under stress  <cit> . in the tomato transcriptome,  <dig> transcripts were identified as hsps, including  <dig> hsp90s,  <dig> hsp70s and  <dig> shsps, mainly hsp20s, as well as  <dig> other hsp transcripts .table  <dig> 
genes related to heat shock proteins , reactive oxygen species  scavenging, and pathogens resistance


apx, ascorbate peroxidase; cat, catalase; dhar, dehydroascorbate reductase; erf/erebp, ethylene response factor; et, ethylene; etr, ethylene receptor; glr, glutaredoxin; glu, beta- <dig> -glucanase; gpx, glutathione peroxidase; gr, glutathione reductase; gsh-asa, glutathione-ascorbate; gst, glutathione-s-transferase; hsp, heat shock protein; ja, jasmonic acid; jar <dig>  jasmonate resistant 1; jaz, jasmonate zim-domain protein; mdar, monodehydroascorbate reductase; pal, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; pod, peroxidase; ppo, polyphenol oxidase; pr <dig>  pathogenesis-related proteins; prxr, peroxiredoxin; ros, reactive oxygen species; sa, salicylic acid; shsp, small heat shock protein; sod, superoxide, tga, tgacg/as- <dig>  binding; trx, thioredoxin.



hsp90s and hsp70s are important members of the hsp protein family. the major role of hsp <dig> is to manage protein folding  <cit> , and it also plays key roles in signal-transduction networks, cell-cycle control, protein degradation, and protein trafficking  <cit> . hsp70s function in preventing aggregation, assisting refolding, protein import and translocation, signal transduction, and transcriptional activation  <cit> . in this transcriptome, three up-regulated and one down-regulated hsp90s were weakly expressed. two of the three up-regulated hsp90s had high transcript abundances , while the down-regulated hsp <dig> was expressed at low abundance. among  <dig> hsp70s,  <dig> transcripts differed in expression level, with eight up-regulated and eight down-regulated, although the differences in expression were slight. the up-regulated tcons_ <dig>  and the down-regulated tcons_ <dig>  showed high and moderate transcript abundances, respectively. the other changed hsp70s were expressed at low abundances.

although many hsp70s and hsp90s were slightly up-regulated, some showed high transcript abundances. for a highly-abundant transcript, a slightly changed ratio may substantially alter its abundance and induce physiological changes. this research indicated that hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> may play an important role in aba responses.

small hsps are a large family present ubiquitously in all organisms. plants have many more shsps than other eukaryotes  <cit> . in  <dig> shsps,  <dig> slightly changed their expression levels by aba, including four up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated transcripts. all up-regulated shsps had low transcript abundances in both the aba treatment and control. among the down-regulated shsps, there were five with moderate abundance  in both libraries , and the other six had low abundances. shsps bind denatured proteins and prevent their irreversible aggregation, so they are referred to as ‘paramedics of the cell’  <cit> . therefore, they have a crucial and fundamental role in plant cell biology  <cit> , and contribute to the molecular adaptation to a wide range of environmental stresses, including heat, cold, drought, salinity, and oxidative stress  <cit> .

at present, studies of aba responses to hsp are limited. hsp <dig> mrnas in wheat leaves were reported to be induced by 2 h of dehydration and 50 μm aba  <cit> . in an examination of nine rice hsp genes under abiotic stresses and aba treatment, only oshsp <dig>  was induced by aba while oshsp <dig>  was suppressed  <cit> . in this study, several hsp70s and hsp90s were up-regulated, while most shsps were down-regulated. these observations imply that the hsp genes may play different roles in plant development and abiotic stress responses. furthermore, the relationship between aba and hsps will be interesting to investigate in the future.

genes related to the reactive oxygen species  scavenging system
overproduction of reactive oxygen species  and overexpression of various antioxidant enzymes in the ros scavenging system occur during almost all biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . in total, there were  <dig> transcripts identified as encoding enzymes in the ros scavenging system . they were categorized into the glutathione-ascorbate  cycle , the glutathione peroxidase  pathway , the peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin  pathway , superoxide dismutase  and the catalases . the largest families were genes encoding thioredoxins , peroxidases , and glutathione s-transferases .

in a stress environment, the first step in o <dig> reduction produces diffusible hydroperoxyl  and superoxide  radicals  <cit> . meanwhile, sods are induced to rapidly disproportionate o2− into oxygen and h2o <dig>  however, of nine sods, one with high abundance  was slightly down-regulated, and another  showed slightly increased expression level. the other six sods showed no changes . it was also found that the expression levels of sods showed slightly change after aba treatment in arabidopsis  <cit> .

cat reduces h2o <dig> directly to water and oxygen. in this study, the most of the genes encoding cat were up-regulated by aba, suggesting the importance of cats in scavenging ros under aba stress. among the seven identified cat genes , the abundances of tcons_ <dig>  tcons_ <dig>  tcons_ <dig>  tcons_ <dig>  and tcons_ <dig> in aba treatment were higher than in control by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold, respectively. in particular, tcons_ <dig>  and tcons_ <dig>  had high abundance, and tcons_ <dig> was expressed a moderate levels .

moreover, h2o <dig> can be also indirectly scavenged by the ascorbate-glutathione  cycle, the gpx pathway, and the prxr/trx pathway  <cit> . the asa-gsh cycle contained  <dig> glutaredoxins ,  <dig> ascorbate peroxidases , five monodehydroascorbate reductases , eight dehydroascorbate reductases , and four glutathione reductases . most transcripts showed slight differences in their expression levels between the two libraries. only three transcripts, tcons_ <dig> , tcons_ <dig>  and tcons_ <dig>  were significantly up-regulated.

in the gpx pathway, there were  <dig> gsts , eight glutathione peroxidases , and  <dig> pods . all up-regulated genes had low transcript abundances except tcons_ <dig> , which was moderately abundant. most down-regulated transcripts were expressed at low abundance, six occurred at moderate abundance , and two gsts  were highly abundant. moreover, most transcripts in this group showed slight alterations in expression level between the libraries. exceptionally, one gst  and three pods  were significantly up-regulated and three gsts  and two pods  were significantly down-regulated.

there were  <dig> transcripts encoding trxs  and  <dig> transcripts encoding prxrs  in the prxr/trx pathway. all up-regulated trxs were expressed at low abundance in both libraries , except tcons_ <dig> and tcons_ <dig>  among the down-regulated prxr and trx genes, more than half were moderately or highly abundant.

the results of this study showed that most transcripts of apx, mdar, dhar, gr, gpx, glr, prxr, and trx were down-regulated or did not change in expression level. these enzymes reduce oxidative damage by h2o <dig> in cells directly or indirectly, depending on the gsh redox state, which is catalyzed by gr . previous research demonstrated that h2o <dig> and the gsh/gssg couple may interact with other signaling pathways that regulate the expression of antioxidant genes during stress responses  <cit> . however, this study showed that exogenous aba repressed the expression of the genes encoding enzymes related to the gsh/gssg couple, suggesting that aba signaling may be independent of gsh redox signaling.

furthermore, more than half of the gsts, which may catalyze the conjugation reaction of gsh and protect sh-containing enzymes against oxidation, were induced by aba  <cit> . aba probably also caused the down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes that depend on gsh. pod catalyzes an early step in lignin synthesis in the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, which can increase the rigidity of cell walls to protect plants from pathogenic bacteria  <cit>  and allowing them to resist wilting and mechanical weakness imparted by abiotic stresses  <cit> . this study found  <dig> aba-induced pod genes that maybe participated in these processes.

genes related to pathogen resistance
the phytohormone aba plays a multifaceted and pivotal role in plant immunity. in the whole transcriptome, a large number of genes related to disease resistance were detected, including  <dig> pal transcripts , five polyphenol oxidase  transcripts ,  <dig> beta- <dig> -glucanase  transcripts , and  <dig> chitinase transcripts . there were more up-regulated isoforms than down-regulated ones, and the expression changes of up-regulated isoforms were greater than down-regulated one. the results suggested that aba has a greater positive than negative impact on tomato pathogen resistance.

the four up-regulated pals , the up-regulated ppo , the up-regulated chitinase , and one down-regulated glu  showed high or moderate abundances. other transcripts of pal, ppo, glu, and chitinase genes were expressed at low abundance, including the significantly up-regulated ppo , glus , and chitinase  . pal, ppo, glu and chitinase are often associated with improved plant resistance to pathogens . our previous study showed that foliar spraying of exogenous aba  could enhance resistance to alternaria solani  infection in tomato by activating defense genes and enhancing the activities of defense-related enzymes, including pal, ppo and pod, pr <dig>  glu, and sod <cit> .

in this transcriptome, many genes in the salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , and ethylene  signal transduction pathways were detected. these pathways play well-established roles in phytopathogen defenses  <cit> . tgacg/as- <dig> bindings  and pathogenesis-related proteins  are critical component in the sa signaling pathway, while jasmonate resistant  <dig>  and jasmonate zim-domain proteins  are crucial in the ja signaling pathway and ethylene receptors  and ethylene response factor/ethylene-responsive tfs  are vital to the et signaling pathway . most of these genes were up-regulated by exogenous aba and most were expressed at low abundance.

salicylic acid, a key phytohormone in plant–pathogen interactions, is typically associated with systemic expression of pathogenesis-related protein genes against biotrophs and hemibiotrophs. this response often culminates in a localized cell death termed the hypersensitive response . ja and et predominantly protected arabidopsis against biotrophic pathogens  <cit> . in tomato, the comparative transcriptome results indicated that aba played a positive role in biotic stress resulting from the crosstalk between aba and sa, ja, and et.

in general, aba is thought to play a negative role in plant resistance to both biotrophic and necrotrophic fungi and bacteria, and aba interacts antagonistically with sa, ja, and et in various ways  <cit> . for example, in tomato, the aba-deficient mutant sitiens was much more resistant to erwinia chrysanthemi, and exogenous aba  made both the wild type and sitiens more susceptible to e. chrysanthemi <cit> . aba  decreased the disease resistance of rice to rice blast  by suppressing some genes in the sa signaling pathway  <cit> . however, in this study, aba largely up-regulated the genes related to biotic stresses, indicating that aba has potential to promote pathogen resistance in tomato. furthermore, the concentration of aba applied here  was much lower than that used in most previous reports . we hypothesize that the aba concentration is very important in determining whether plant resistance to pathogens will be improved or suppressed.

aba not only mediates tolerance to adverse environmental conditions, but also affects the resistance to biotic stresses. it plays critical roles in the interrelationship between biotic and abiotic stress responses. further insights into the core network of aba signaling in plants will be crucial for genetically engineering and breeding crop species with both improved abiotic stress tolerance and pathogen resistance  <cit> . aba has also been recognized to crosstalk with the “developmental” hormones auxin, gibberellic acid, cytokinins, and brassinosteroids in plant immunity  <cit> . in this study, the expressions of many genes related to these hormones were also affected by aba . these genes may directly or indirectly contribute to plant pathogen resistance.

quantitative real-time-pcr validation of differentially-expressed transcripts from rna-seq
to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of this illumina rna-seq result,  <dig> transcripts were chosen randomly for quantitative real-time  pcr. those genes were involved in metabolism, information transfer, or were hypothetical proteins, and included up-regulated, down-regulated, and unaffected transcripts. the primer sequences, gene functions, and fpkm and qrt-pcr values are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the qrt-pcr results generally agreed  with the changes in transcript abundance determined by rna-seq, suggesting the reliability of the rna-seq data.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide transcriptome analysis results indicated that exogenous aba can influence the aba signaling pathway with the core of pyr/pyl/rcars-pp2cs-snrk2s. exogenous aba up-regulated many genes related to stress tolerance and pathogen resistance, including various tfs, hsp90s, hsp70s, cats, gsts, pods, pals, ppos and chitinases, as well as the genes tga, pr <dig>  jar <dig>  jaz, ert and erf/erebp in the sa, ja, and et signaling pathways. these results suggested that aba has the potential to improve the abiotic and biotic tolerance of tomato. the study extends the knowledge of the complex molecular and cellular events during aba signaling and of aba-induced genes. challenges and opportunities remain in exploring the complex interactions between aba and defense in whole plants.
