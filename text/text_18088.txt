BACKGROUND
the nuclear envelope consists of inner and outer nuclear membranes, nuclear pore complexes, and the underlying nuclear lamina. the nuclear lamina connects with both integral membrane proteins of the inner nuclear membrane and chromatin  <cit> . nuclear lamins are intermediate filament proteins that are the major components of the nuclear lamina. lamins are type v intermediate filament proteins consisting of a central coiled-coil region and globular n- and c-terminal domains. they are classified into two subgroups: a-type and b-type. a-type lamins, including lamin a  and lamin c , are alternatively spliced products of a single gene locus, with lamin a having an extra  <dig> amino acid residues at its c-terminus that are not present in lamin c  <cit> . during the mitotic phase of every cell cycle in eukaryotes, the structure of the nuclear envelope undergoes a dramatic assembly and disassembly process. the nuclear lamina depolymerizes as a result of mitosis-specific phosphorylation of the nuclear lamins at specific sites  <cit> . several kinases, including p34cdc2/cyclin b , cdk <dig>  protein kinase c  and akt/protein kinase b , are reported to phosphorylate lamin a/c on different sites during mitosis or under certain physiological/pathological conditions  <cit> . multiple cell cycle-dependent lamin c phosphorylation sites have been determined  <cit> . mutation of two lamin a phosphorylation sites, ser- <dig>  and ser- <dig> , has been reported to prevent nuclear lamina disassembly in mitotic cells  <cit> .

phosphoepitope-specific antibodies that selectively recognize phosphorylated, but not non-phosphorylated, forms of a variety of protein kinases or their substrates are valuable tools for measuring kinase activity and substrate phosphorylation during numerous cellular events  <cit> . many of these antibodies are generated in animals using a specific phosphopeptide as the antigen. because the phosphate group is a common structure present in every phosphopeptide antigen, an anti-phosphopeptide antibody raised against a specific phosphopeptide may display a broader immunoreactivity, interacting with structurally similar phosphorylated motifs  <cit> .

pak <dig>  a member of the p21-activated kinase  family, participates in regulating diverse cell functions, including cell morphogenesis, motility, survival, apoptosis, mitosis, and angiogenesis  <cit> . previously, we identified thr- <dig> as the autophosphorylation regulatory site of the catalytic fragment of pak <dig>  <cit> . we subsequently generated a phosphoepitope-specific antibody, p-stm, using the synthetic phospho-stm-11-c peptide, s398krstp402mvgtpyc <dig>  which encompasses the sequence of the regulatory autophosphorylation site of pak <dig>  as an antigen. this antibody recognizes the autophosphorylated/activated, but not the unphosphorylated/inactive, form of pak <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, we found that p-stm also reacted with a number of mitotic phosphoproteins in human a <dig> and hela cells  <cit>  that are different from those detected by mpm- <dig>  a monoclonal antibody raised against total lysates of mitotic hela cells that recognizes more than  <dig> mitotic phosphoproteins  <cit> . using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight  mass spectrometry, we further identified lamins a and c as two of the mitotic cell-specific phosphoproteins recognized by p-stm  <cit> . however, the exact lamin a/c phosphoepitope recognized by p-stm, the kinase responsible for generating the phosphoepitope, as well as quantitative changes in the phosphoepitope between interphase and mitosis, remained elusive.

the aims of this study were to identify the lamin a/c phosphoepitope recognized by p-stm in mitosis and quantify differential phosphorylation of lamin a/c phosphorylation sites at interphase and mitosis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  coupled with the silac  approach. we found that cdk1-catalyzed phosphorylation of lamin a/c at thr- <dig> created a p-stm-recognizable phosphoepitope. silac-based quantitative mass spectrometric analyses of lamin a/c isolated from hela s <dig> cells at interphase and mitosis further revealed  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increases in the phosphorylation levels of thr- <dig>  ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> in lamins a and c, and ser- <dig> in lamin a only, in mitotic compared with interphase hela s <dig> cells. among the four sites identified and quantified, thr- <dig> and ser- <dig> showed the most dramatic cell cycle-dependent changes in phosphorylation.

RESULTS
phosphorylation of interphase lamin a/c by cdk <dig> creates a p-stm phosphoepitope
we have previously shown that lamins a and c are two of the mitotic phosphoproteins recognized by the p-stm antibody  <cit> . because the cdk <dig> complex is known to phosphorylate lamin a/c at multiple sites during mitosis  <cit> , we tested whether interphase lamin a/c can be phosphorylated in vitro by cdk <dig> to create a p-stm phosphoepitope. lamins a and c were immunoprecipitated from total extracts of unsynchronized hela s <dig> cells and in vitro-phosphorylated by cdk <dig>  the reaction products, as well as total extracts of hela s <dig> cells, treated without or with nocodazole , were then immunoblotted with anti-lamin a/c antibody or p-stm. both lamins a and c were efficiently immunoprecipitated and detected with anti-lamin a/c antibody . after in vitro cdk1-catalyzed phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated lamin a/c, two major additional p-stm-immunoreactive signals corresponding to phosphorylated lamins a and c emerged , indicating that cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of interphase lamins a and c generates p-stm-recognizable phosphoepitope in vitro.

in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant gst-lamin a/c by cdk <dig> creates a p-stm phosphoepitope
to identify the cdk1-dependent phosphorylation site on lamin a/c recognized by p-stm, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays using bacterially expressed, recombinant gst-lamin a/c fusion proteins as substrates for cdk <dig>  these fusion proteins cover different domains  of lamin c  containing known phosphorylation sites for cdk <dig> , pkc , or akt/pkb . the reaction products were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and subjected to protein staining, autoradiography, and immunoblotting with p-stm . although radiography revealed that the n-terminal region  and the smaller n <dig> region  within it, as well as the c-terminal region , were strongly phosphorylated by cdk <dig>  a p-stm phosphoepitope was created by cdk <dig> only in the intact n-terminal and n <dig> regions. these results indicate that the cdk1-dependent p-stm phosphoepitope is located within the n <dig> region  of lamin a/c.

cdk1-mediated thr- <dig> phosphorylation of lamin a/c produces a p-stm phosphoepitope
in the n <dig> region  of lamin a/c, two residues  are known to be phosphorylated by cdk <dig> during mitosis  <cit> . taken together with the data shown above, this suggests that phosphorylation of thr- <dig> and/or ser- <dig> by cdk <dig> may create the p-stm phosphoepitope. to test this hypothesis, we replaced thr- <dig> and/or ser- <dig> in the n <dig> region of lamin a/c with ala by site-directed mutagenesis, and expressed and purified these mutated gst-fusion proteins  . these recombinant proteins were in vitro-phosphorylated by cdk <dig>  and the reaction products were analyzed as described above. the results showed that mutation of thr- <dig>  but not ser- <dig>  to ala completely blocked formation of the p-stm phosphoepitope, although all three mutated proteins could still be phosphorylated by cdk <dig> . in addition, dot-blot analyses using synthetic phosphopeptides a–d , which mimic the tryptic digestion products of phosphorylated lamin a/c containing aa 12– <dig>  were further performed to confirm the p-stm phosphoepitope. these dot-blot experiments clearly showed that the p-stm antibody could detect both the cdk1-phosphorylated gst–n <dig> fusion protein and the authentic p-stm peptide antigen used to generate the p-stm antibody . under the assay conditions used, we found that the p-stm antibody recognized peptide b  and, to a lesser extent, peptide a , but not peptides c  or d  . moreover, the immunoreactivity of the p-stm antibody toward lamins a and c immunoprecipitated from noc-treated hela s <dig> cells was significantly blocked by inclusion of peptide b and, to a lesser extent, peptide a, but not peptide c or d, in immunoblot competition assays . taken together, these results indicate that phosphorylation of thr- <dig> in lamin a/c by cdk <dig> during mitosis creates the p-stm phosphoepitope.

lc-ms/ms-based identification of phospho-thr- <dig> and/or -ser-22-containing peptides derived from a gst–n <dig> fusion protein phosphorylated by cdk <dig> in vitro
we have shown that phosphorylation of thr- <dig> in lamin a/c by cdk <dig> can generate a p-stm phosphoepitope and that the p-stm antibody can recognize both mono-phosphorylated peptide b  and dual-phosphorylated peptide a . however, it is not clear whether the mono-phosphopeptide  or dual phosphopeptide  form produced by cdk1-catalyzed phosphorylation of lamin a/c is the major contributor to the formation of the p-stm-immunoreactive site. to address this issue, we applied lc-ms/ms to directly detect peptides a–d in tryptic digestion products of gst–n <dig> fusion protein phosphorylated by cdk <dig> in vitro. first, equal amounts of the four model synthetic peptides a–d  were mixed and applied to lc-ms/ms to generate standard chromatograms and ms/ms spectra for comparison. as shown in figure 4a , peptides a, b and d coeluted almost together, followed immediately by peptide c; the rank order of signal intensity of these peptides was peptide d > peptide c > peptide b > > peptide a. subsequent ms/ms analysis of each target peptide based on its known mass and ms/ms spectral assignments unambiguously identified all four peptide standards in one lc-ms/ms run . interestingly, although peptides b  and c  are mono-phosphopeptide isomers with the same mass and isoelectric point , they could still be separated and unambiguously identified under the lc-ms/ms conditions used here.

we then used these assay conditions to analyze the tryptic peptides derived from the gst–n <dig> fusion protein  that had been phosphorylated by cdk <dig> in vitro. all four peptide forms were clearly detected by lc-ms/ms analysis , and the patterns of ms/ms spectra for the four peptides obtained from this in vitro-phosphorylated sample were almost identical to those of synthetic peptide standards . importantly, both mono-phosphopeptide c  and di-phosphopeptide a  forms were present in larger amounts than the mono-phosphopeptide b  form . collectively, these results indicate that cdk <dig> exhibits multiple phosphorylation modes towards the n-terminal region of lamin a/c and suggest that dual phosphorylation of lamin a/c on thr- <dig> and ser- <dig> makes a major contribution to the formation of the p-stm-immunoreactive site.

silac-based quantification of differences in levels of site-specific lamin a and c phosphorylation between interphase and mitosis
the silac method, used in conjunction with lc-ms/ms, has been shown to be a powerful approach for analyzing quantitative changes in the proteome of viable cells  <cit> . this approach has also been applied to dissect changes in site-specific phosphorylation of target proteins in cells stimulated by extracellular signals  <cit> . to gain insight into the quantitative changes in the phosphorylation status of lamin a and c phosphorylation sites during mitosis, we applied the silac method and lc-ms/ms to quantify the levels of multiple phosphorylation sites of lamin a and c isolated from hela s <dig> cells at interphase and mitosis. the workflow is depicted in figure 5a. briefly, hela s <dig> cells were grown in medium containing light or heavy amino acids for six doubling times. in condition  <dig>  ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ cells were treated for 16 h with noc  and dmso , respectively; treatments were reversed in condition  <dig> . this experimental paradigm allowed us to obtain interphase and mitosis populations from both treatment combinations. extracts from both sets of cells were mixed at a 1: <dig> ratio and immunoprecipitated using an anti-lamin a/c antibody. the immunoprecipitated products were then separated by sds-page, followed by coomassie blue staining. the protein staining pattern is shown in figure 5b. gel bands corresponding to lamins a and c were excised for in-gel tryptic digestion, and the digestion products were subjected to lc-ms/ms analysis, followed by ms data processing and quantitative analysis using the peptide quantification pipeline .

using this strategy, we identified and quantified  <dig> peptides in isolated lamin a and  <dig> peptides in isolated lamin c , achieving 64% sequence coverage for lamin a and 66% sequence coverage for lamin c . of these peptides,  <dig> of  <dig>  of those for lamin a and  <dig> of  <dig>  of those for lamin c exhibited an average fold-change  between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the mean and median of average fold-changes for all quantified peptides were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for lamin a and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for lamin c, respectively , indicating that dmso-treated and noc-treated cell pools contained approximately equal amounts of lamin a and c proteins, and that the levels of most detected peptides from lamins a and c were not significantly changed by noc treatment. most quantitation results were reproducible in a second biological replicate of the experiment . from additional file 2: table s <dig>  however, it is clear that noc treatment significantly altered the amounts of eight peptides  from lamin a and six peptides  from lamin c in hela s <dig> cells. these results are further summarized in table  <dig> 

this quantitative analysis revealed that in mitotic hela s <dig> cells  mono-phosphorylation of s12gaqasstplsptr <dig> at ser- <dig> and di-phosphorylation of s12gaqasstplsptr <dig> at both thr- <dig> and ser- <dig> were the most prominent phosphorylation events  on lamins a and c;  di-phosphorylation of l389spsptsqr <dig> at both ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> on lamins a and c were increased  <dig> – <dig>  fold, in association with a parallel 53–57% decrease in mono-phosphorylation of l389spsptsqr <dig> at ser-390; and  phosphorylation of s628vggsgggsfgdnlvtr <dig> at ser- <dig> on lamin a was augmented  <dig>  fold . representative mass spectra of selected non-phosphopeptide and phosphopeptide pairs from lamins a and c in this silac-based experiment are presented in figure 5c.

discussion
in this study, we identified phospho-thr- <dig> of lamin a/c as the phosphoepitope recognized by p-stm, a polyclonal antibody originally generated against the regulatory autophosphorylation site of pak <dig>  this phosphoepitope can be created in vitro by cdk1-catalyzed phosphorylation of recombinant gst-lamin c-n <dig> protein . moreover, an lc-ms/ms analysis of this in vitro phosphorylation product clearly indicated that thr- <dig> and ser- <dig> are the two prominent sites phosphorylated by cdk <dig> . taken together with the demonstration by silac-based quantitative ms analysis that the level of thr- <dig> phosphorylation on lamin a/c increased > <dig> fold in mitotic hela s <dig> cells , these observations indicate that cdk1-mediated thr- <dig> phosphorylation of lamin a/c is responsible for generating the phosphoepitope recognized by p-stm in mitotic cells.

as noted above, the nuclear lamina depolymerizes as a result of mitosis-specific phosphorylation of nuclear lamins at specific sites  <cit> . the functional roles of some phosphorylation sites of lamin a/c in cell-cycle progression or in certain physiological settings have been investigated. for example, mutation of thr- <dig>  ser- <dig>  or ser- <dig>  to ala on lamin a significantly inhibits lamin a disassembly in mitotic cells, whereas mutation of both ser- <dig> and ser- <dig>  to ala inhibits the transport of mutant lamin a to the nucleus  <cit> . the major phosphorylated sites of lamin a/c are located on both sides of the α-helical central rod domain, and phosphorylation at these sites is known to interfere with the formation of lamin head-to-tail polymers from lamin dimers  <cit> . phosphorylation of ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> of lamin a by cdk <dig>  which induces the nuclear lamin a dispersion that leads to cdk5-mediated neurotoxicity, has been observed in neuronal cells challenged by neurotoxic stimuli   <cit> . this cdk5-mediated nuclear lamin a dispersion and neurotoxicity is significantly diminished by introduction of phosphorylation-resistant mutations  in lamins, highlighting cdk5-mediated ser-22/ser- <dig> phosphorylation as a major mechanism for the neuronal death elicited by neurotoxic stimuli  <cit> . in addition, as first demonstrated by cenni et al.  <cit> , lamin a n-terminal phosphorylation is associated with myoblast activation, and this phosphorylation is significantly impaired in mature muscle fibers from patients with emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy . these authors subsequently demonstrated that  akt activated by insulin phosphorylates lamin a/c at ser- <dig> in c2c <dig> mouse myoblasts, but this phosphorylation cannot be detected in primary cells from an edmd- <dig> patient;  akt phosphorylation at ser- <dig> targets the precursor prelamin a for degradation; and  akt regulates transcription of the gene encoding lamin a   <cit> . moreover, specific phosphorylation of ser- <dig> of a-type lamins in lmna-associated myopathy patients has been reported, although the role of this phosphorylation remains to be established  <cit> .

to facilitate study of the site-specific alteration of phosphorylation levels on lamins during mitosis or in other physiological settings, research laboratories and biotechnology companies have produced several phosphoepitope-specific antibodies against specific phosphorylation sites of lamins. for instance, kuga developed monoclonal antibodies against five specific phosphorylation sites  of lamin b <dig> and used these antibodies to study dynamic changes at these phospho-sites in lamin b2/b <dig> throughout the cell cycle  <cit> . however, only a few phosphoepitope-specific antibodies against lamin a/c, including those against phospho-ser- <dig>  phospho-ser- <dig>  phospho-ser- <dig>  <cit> , and phospho-ser- <dig>  <cit> , have been reported, although the antibody raised against the phospho-ser- <dig> of lamin b <dig> should also be included since it recognizes the homologous residue  in lamin a/c  <cit> . our current study demonstrates that the p-stm antibody represents a useful tool for investigating the thr- <dig> phosphorylation of lamin a/c in living cells.

lc-ms/ms analyses of the gst–n <dig> fusion protein in vitro-phosphorylated by cdk <dig> revealed the presence of phospho-thr- <dig> and/or phospho-ser- <dig> in two mono-phosphopeptides  and one di-phosphopeptide . using the same lc-ms/ms conditions to analyze lamin a/c immunoprecipitated from equal mixtures of interphase and mitotic hela s <dig> cell extracts, however, we only detected the phospho-ser-22-containing peptide, sgaqasstplsp22ptr, and the phospho-thr-19/phospho-ser-22-containing peptide, sgaqasstp19plsp22ptr; the phospho-thr-19-containing peptide, sgaqasstp19plsptr, in the n-terminal region of lamin a/c was not detected . this observation seems to indicate that, in mitotic hela s <dig> cells, mono- and dual-phosphorylation of the peptide s12gaqasstplsptr <dig> at ser- <dig> and thr-19/ser- <dig>  respectively, are the major phosphorylation events that occur in the lamin a/c n-terminal region. the mono-phosphorylation of this peptide at thr- <dig> was either too low to be detected by lc-ms/ms or did not occur in mitotic hela s <dig> cells. in this scenario, the di-phosphopeptide sgaqasstp19plsp22ptr may represent the major phosphoepitope recognized by p-stm in mitotic hela s <dig> cells. this interpretation is further supported by the observation that p-stm recognized both the phospho-thr-19-containing peptide, sgaqasstp19plsptr, and the phospho-thr-19/phospho-ser-22-containing peptide, sgaqasstp19plsp22ptr, in dot-blot experiments .

several lines of evidence suggest that the epitopes recognized by p-stm are not sequence-conserved but may be structure-related. to date, three phosphoproteins recognized by p-stm have been identified: pak <dig>  <cit> , lamin a/c  <cit> , and mst <dig> . like pak <dig>  mst <dig> is also a member of the ste <dig> kinase family. an alignment and comparison of the amino acid sequences of the phosphoepitopes in the three proteins, s398krstpmvgtpy , i174krntpfvgtpf  and s12gaqasstpplsptr , reveals high homology only between the epitope sequences from pak <dig> and mst3; no obvious similarity exists between the phosphoepitope from lamin a/c  and those from pak <dig> or mst <dig>  the fact that phospho-thr appears to be the only conserved ‘structure’ between these three epitope sequences would seem to suggest that phospho-thr is the most critical determinant for generating the p-stm phosphoepitope. however, we have observed that several phosphoproteins containing phospho-thr, including pak2- and gsk3-phosphorylated mbp, do not react to p-stm . therefore, the microenvironment surrounding phospho-thr in a phosphoprotein may play an important role in creating the epitope recognized by p-stm. some additional techniques, including three-dimensional structure analysis of the three phosphoepitopes described above, may be helpful in analyzing the precise structural requirements for producing the p-stm phosphoepitope.

CONCLUSIONS
the data shown here indicate that p-stm is a valuable tool for identifying phosphoproteins involved in regulating the mitotic process and monitoring the phosphorylation level of phospho-thr- <dig> on lamin a/c during cell-cycle progression.
