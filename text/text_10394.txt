BACKGROUND
the mammalian retina is a highly structured tissue developmentally originating from neuroectodermal evagination of the diencephalon and subsequent invagination processes resulting in the formation of two cellular layers which ultimately give rise to the inner neural retina and the outer retinal pigment epithelium  monolayer  <cit> . in the adult, the neural retina consists of approximately  <dig> distinct cell types histologically structured into three layers of cells  and two layers of neuronal interconnections   <cit> . the rpe is differentiated into polarized cells with an apical and a basal orientation separating the neural retina from the underlying choroidal blood supply. with its apical microvilli-like processes, the rpe establishes an intimate contact with the photoreceptor outer segments to sustain their metabolic support and maintain photoreceptor integrity  <cit> . together, the neural retina and the rpe provide the structural and functional basis for light perception by ensuring the capture of photons, the conversion of light stimuli into complex patterns of neuronal impulses and the transmission of the initially processed signals to the higher visual centers of the brain.

recent progress in retinal research has greatly enhanced our current understanding of basic functional processes in the adult retina . a great deal of effort has focused on the molecular dissection of the phototransduction pathway and the retinoid cycle . besides elucidating physiological mechanisms in normal tissue, the identification of genes involved in hereditary retinal disease has provided another valuable source of insight into functional pathways of the retina and the rpe .

despite these advances, a remaining challenge is to obtain a reference genome-wide expression map of the retina/rpe transcriptome, further facilitating the identification of retinal susceptibility genes, but most importantly, offering an invaluable resource for functional genomics studies. initial analyses of human  <cit>  and mouse  <cit>  whole genome sequences and the use of more recent comparative gene prediction algorithms  <cit>  suggest an overall number of mammalian gene loci in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> . these estimates have largely been validated by experimental data on gene transcription  <cit>  although alternative promoter usage, differential exon splicing during mrna maturation, alternative usage of polyadenylation sites and other post-transcriptional modifications may further increase the genetic diversity required to encode the full complement of cellular transcripts  <cit> . in addition, there may be a considerable number of non-coding genes unaccounted for by current annotations  <cit> .

in recent years, a number of approaches and technologies were adopted to identify genes expressed in the retina/rpe of human, cow, dog and mouse including data-mining and assembly of publically available expressed sequence tag  information  <cit> , sequencing of cdna libraries generated via conventional methods  <cit>  or via normalization techniques  <cit> , hybridization to gene arrays of various formats  <cit>  and serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> . suppression subtractive hybridization  has been shown to be an efficient technique with which differentially expressed genes can be normalized and enriched over 1000-fold in a single round of hybridization  <cit> . subsequently, applications of ssh to identify retina and rpe-enriched genes have been reported  <cit> .

based on a comprehensive survey of data available from  <dig> independent studies applying a wide spectrum of gene identification approaches we have now assembled a first genome-wide reference transcriptome of the adult mammalian retina/rpe. this reference transcriptome comprises  <dig>  non-redundant transcripts and likely reflects up to 90% of the mammalian retinome.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  primary datasets on gene transcripts from the adult mammalian retina/rpe tissues have been generated in  <dig> independent studies . of these,  <dig>  datasets  were available and attributable to unique locuslink identifiers . correcting for gene redundancy within and between studies yielded a catalogue of  <dig>  retinal/rpe genes. a survey of incidence and origin of each of these genes in the various studies analyzed demonstrated that  <dig>  transcripts were found only once  while the remaining  <dig>  genes  were confirmed in at least two and up to  <dig> independent gene identification approaches . thus, the latter compilation of genes may represent a more conservative description of the retinome minimizing a potential bias in data ascertainment. of the 13k retinome,  <dig>  genes were solely identified in retinal studies  while  <dig> genes were exclusively found in the rpe datasets .

to assess the degree of completeness of the adult mammalian retinome, we compared the locuslink ids of the  <dig>  transcripts to partial lists of genes known i) to be specifically expressed in the retina/rpe  , ii) to play a role in the phototransduction pathway/vitamin a cycle  , iii) to encode retinal/rpe proteins verified by immunohistochemistry  , and iv) to be associated with syndromic and non-syndromic retinal disease  . the data show that the compiled retinome covers all retina/rpe-specific transcripts  and 53/ <dig>  of the phototransduction pathway/vitamin a cycle genes. known retinal/rpe proteins are represented by 204/ <dig>  transcripts while 87/ <dig>  genes known to be involved in retinal diseases are found in the 13k retinome collection . to further evaluate the significance of these findings, partial transcriptomes of heart , liver  and prostate  were assembled and compared to the four selected categories. in category  <dig>  none of the retina/rpe-specific genes were present in the heart, liver, or prostate partial transcriptomes while category  <dig> revealed four of  <dig> expected ,  <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig>  genes. in category  <dig>  59/ <dig> , 82/ <dig>  and 92/ <dig>  genes were present. retinal disease genes  were found at a rate of  <dig> of  <dig> ,  <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig>  . the expected values for the partial transcriptomes were calculated by adjusting the respective transcriptome sizes relative to the total number of transcripts of the retinome.

a comparison of the 13k retinome with partial transcriptomes of heart, liver, and prostate suggests a high degree of overlapping expression between retina/rpe and heart , liver  and prostate . a total of  <dig>  genes are expressed in all tissues and represent putative "housekeeping" genes . it should be noted that the low number of ubiquitously expressed genes is largely due to the fragmentary nature of the heart, liver, and prostate transcriptomes. with increasing transcriptome complexities this number is likely to increase. analysis of the least complete transcriptome, the heart, reveals that  <dig> / <dig>   transcripts can be classified as ubiquitously expressed  while a maximum of  <dig> / <dig>   genes may display tissue-restricted or tissue-specific expression. a comparison of more complete transcriptomes may significantly reduce the latter estimate. so far  <dig>  genes are only found in the retinome representing a collection of "retinome-enriched" transcripts, while  <dig>  are also present in at least one of the partial transcriptomes of the heart, liver or prostate. thirty-two genes were found to be expressed in heart, liver and prostate but not in the retinome .

the distribution of the mammalian retinome across the human genome was assessed by a paired comparison of the number of reference retinome genes  versus the number of human non-redundant syntenic gene predictions    <cit>  along  <dig> five-mb windows . correction for the total number of sgps relative to the number of retinome genes positioned on average  <dig>   sgps per window compared to  <dig>   retinal genes per window. based on the wilcoxon two-sample paired signed rank test, the null hypothesis assuming similar distribution of the sgps and the retinome genes across the five-mb windows can be rejected at p <  <dig> . while their overall distribution greatly parallels that of the sgps, retinome genes tend to cluster in several chromosomal regions most prominently on chromosomes 6p <dig> -p <dig> , 11q <dig> -q <dig> , 16p <dig> , 19p <dig>  and 19q <dig> -q <dig>  .

to provide positional candidates for syndromic and non-syndromic hereditary retinopathies, the 13k reference retinome as well as the "retinome-enriched" transcripts  were superimposed onto the disease intervals of  <dig> thus far uncloned retinal disorders . in many instances, this results in a significant reduction of genes in the respective intervals offering a manageable number of candidates for retinal diseases . the number of possible candidates is further reduced in the "retinome-enriched" transcript category to gpm6a and vegfc. to make the information on the reference retinome available, we have created the interactive retinacentral database, a research portal which collects and stores information on genes and proteins functionally relevant to the retinal tissues  <cit> . we have implemented an interactive data retrieval system that presently contains linked information on the  <dig>  genes of the 13k reference retinome. database scripts were programmed to synchronize the data with locuslink index files  <cit>  which are updated daily  <cit> .

discussion
compiling the transcriptome of a cell or tissue is arguably more demanding than establishing the number of gene loci encoded by a given genome sequence  <cit> . this may mainly be explained by the dynamic nature of mrna itself which frequently produces alternative transcripts from a single gene locus by usage of tissue-specific promoters, cryptic splice sites or variable polyadenylation signals  <cit> . in addition, variation in gene expression is known to occur within and between populations  <cit>  and allele-specific expression, even from non-imprinted genes, appears to be common  <cit> . further complicating transcriptome definition are effects of gender and age on rna expression  <cit>  as well as agonal and postmortem factors which greatly affect rna integrity and thus frequently influence subsequent analyses  <cit> . finally, differences in experimental technologies and data post-processing add an additional level of variability. taken together, the complexities in mrna metabolism and experimental data handling strongly suggest that there is not a single transcriptome for a given cell or tissue but implies an arbitrary number of individual transcriptomes which need to be defined by a series of parameters such as age, gender, ethnicity, cause and time of death of the tissue donor besides many others. it is therefore advisable to initially aim for a reference transcriptome providing a blueprint of an expression profile within a broadly defined time-frame. following this line of reasoning, we here present a framework of a first reference transcriptome of the retina/rpe consisting of  <dig>  unique transcripts which broadly characterize the mature state of expression in this tissue.

the present meta-analysis has integrated information from  <dig> studies employing diverse technologies to identify retinal/rpe transcrips. among these, sage represents a sensitive tool to detect low level transcription  <cit>  while the pcr-based ssh method is well suited to enrich for differentially expressed genes  <cit> . the combined use of these approaches together with conventional cdna library sequencing and microarray-based techniques provides a more solid assessment of gene expression than would each method alone. for example, sage is based on sequencing of hundreds of thousands of short  tags, ideally derived from a unique location of a single transcript. rare tags could originate from infrequently expressed transcripts but could also reflect minor genomic contamination or minor sequencing errors. for the assembly of the reference retinome we have addressed these concerns by including only those transcripts that have independently been confirmed in a second unrelated study. this has led to a conservative assembly of the 13k retinome. it should be kept in mind however that this proceeding likely excludes a number of authentic transcripts. this is illustrated by the finding that the 15k retinome which comprises  <dig>  transcripts including those which were solely found in a single study , contains an additional five of the  <dig> known retinal disease genes  not included in the 13k retinome. similarly, an additional three genes  involved in the vitamin a/phototransduction pathway are part of the 15k but not the 13k retinome. with additional transcription data on the retina/rpe becoming available, a second generation retinome map will need to address this issue.

the estimation of transcriptome size represents one of the fundamental questions in molecular biology. early studies using reassociation kinetics have calculated the number of distinct mrna transcripts present in various mouse tissues to be between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . initial sage analyses have led to the conclusion that the number of different transcripts observed in normal and tumorous tissue may lie between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . recent data from comprehensive est sequencing of a number of tissues including brain, breast, colon, head/neck, kidney lung, ovary, prostate, and uterus suggest expression of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  distinct genes for each tissue  <cit> . although the size of the reference retinome is consistent with these estimates, the question of adequate transcript representation by the current compilation remains open. we have addressed this by defining a number of gene groups with known expression in retina/rpe and comparing these to the reference retinome. genes exclusively expressed in retina/rpe are highly represented in the retinome , as are mainly tissue-specific genes known to play a role in the vitamin a/phototransduction pathway  . a partial list of  <dig> genes whose encoded proteins were shown by immunohistochemistry to be expressed in the retina/rpe , were represented in the reference retinome at a rate of approximately 79%. similar numbers were obtained for the retinome coverage of retinal disease genes . from these data we conclude that the 13k reference retinome is highly representative of retina/rpe-expressed genes and may describe as much as 90% of the transcript complement in the adult state.

another point of interest concerns the proportion of retinome transcripts which is uniquely expressed in this tissue. brentani et al.  <cit>  estimate that any two tissues may share between 73% and 84% of their transcriptomes. comparing transcription in three tissues  the authors found overlapping expression in 47% of transcripts. to investigate this in more detail, we have compiled three partial transcriptomes from heart , liver  and prostate  by applying the same stringent criteria as defined for the retinome. limited by the size of the partial heart transcriptome, we determined  <dig>  transcripts  to be expressed in all four tissues . comparing the retinome to any of the partial transcriptomes revealed overlapping gene profiles between  <dig> % and  <dig> %. this would suggest that only a minor proportion of retinome transcripts is indeed unique to the retina/rpe. thus far, we have identified a group of so called "retinome-enriched" genes comprising  <dig>  transcripts which are not present in the partial transcriptomes of heart, liver and prostate. this group most likely contains additional "housekeeping" or tissue-restricted transcripts and needs further adjustment by more refined in-silico normalization to comprehensive reference transcriptomes of other tissues.

highly expressed genes including those with a ubiquitous or a tissue-specific transcription profile, have been shown to cluster in chromosomal regions of increased gene expression   <cit> . functionally, this higher order structure has been related to transcriptional regulation  <cit> . to search for a possible correlation, we have determined the chromosomal distribution of the reference retinome independent of gene density. our data show good agreement with the previously established regional expression map defining approximately  <dig> ridges within the human genome. overlaps are most evident for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  from this we conclude that the majority of transcripts assembled in the reference retinome share characteristics of the ridges including moderate to high level expression. this finding may be ascribed to the stringent selection criteria we have applied to assemble the reference retinome by excluding all transcripts  that were reported in only a single study. conversely, the ridge-like pattern of the reference retinome could be an indication that missing transcripts may have features compatible with chromosomal domains defined as anti-ridges  <cit> . as opposed to ridges, clustering of genes in anti-ridges seems associated with significant decreased expression  <cit> . in contrast to their fractional occurrence in transcriptomes, the identification of such low abundant transcripts are likely to require significant resources in order to compile more complete transcriptomes.

to provide positional candidates for retinal disease genes, we have mapped the transcripts representing the reference retinome to the minimal regions defined for  <dig> retinal disease loci with as yet undefined gene mutations. to further limit the number of candidate genes, in particular for loosely defined disease loci such as rp <dig> or vrni, we have similarly integrated the "retinome-enriched" transcripts. this also accommodates for the fact that approximately 50% of retinal disease genes are retina/rpe-specific  <cit> . for  <dig> of  <dig> unknown disease genes we have now identified strong candidates although for some disease loci including aied, cod <dig>  cord <dig>  crv, lca <dig>  rp <dig>  and ush2b, the number of candidates may still exceed capacities of most laboratories for direct analysis. for other disease loci , a restricted number of candidates are now available .

CONCLUSIONS
we here present a first near-complete transcriptome of a defined tissue, the retinome, which may serve as a reference for further efforts to establish spatial, i.e. cell-specific, and developmental transcriptomes of the retina/rpe. a fundamental aspect of the current study was to integrate the available information on gene identification generated by a wide range of techniques. this ensures robustness and reliability of transcript data providing a stringent framework for further expression studies in systems biology. a similar approach for other tissues/cells would be advisable as this may greatly facilitate in-silico identification of tissue-specific genes to elucidate functional pathways vital for a defined cell population. in addition, the reference retinome may prove valuable for providing strong candidates for hereditary as well as genetically complex diseases and thus may help to further our understanding of retinal biology in health and disease.
