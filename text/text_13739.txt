BACKGROUND
the ability to visualize the internal anatomy of living animals is fundamental to our understanding of biology and medicine. although imaging systems for respiratory, circulatory and musculoskeletal systems are available for large animals, real-time visualization of the internal processes of small animals has been limited by scaling factors and imaging technology. in order to visualize internal physiological mechanisms of millimeter-sized animals in real-time, a probe must have the following features:  ability to penetrate the opaque exterior,  spatial resolution in the 1– <dig> μm range,  temporal resolution below  <dig> ms, and  sensitivity to soft tissue. visible light microscopy  is not broadly applicable for intact, live animals due to animal opacity and size limitations. near-infrared  microscopy has been tried, but with limited success due to poor spatial resolution  <cit> . magnetic resonance imaging  has been used to image insects  <cit> , but the best resolution obtained so far is about  <dig> μm, and images must be averaged over seconds to minutes. for sufficient penetration, spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging is wavelength-limited  <cit>  to about  <dig> μm. conventional x-ray imaging relies on absorption as the contrast mechanism, which is ineffective at visualizing soft tissue. for example, at  <dig> kev, the maximum absorption contrast of a 100-μm diameter air-filled trachea in water is only  <dig> %, smaller than the poisson noise for a high-end 16-bit ccd camera .

compared to these other techniques, synchrotron x-ray phase-contrast imaging  <cit>  is ideal for visualizing well-defined internal structures that have different mass densities. tracheal tubes, in particular, show up extremely well , with edge contrast in a 100-μm diameter trachea that can be more than 50%. for example, this technique has been recently used to observe directly tracheal compression dynamics in opaque insects  <cit> . this research, which examined detailed networks of tracheal tubes down to tubes of  <dig> μm in diameter in living specimens, has revealed a mechanism of breathing that was previously identified with only a single species of translucent flea  <cit> . such studies demonstrate the ability of synchrotron imaging to open up whole new avenues of scientific inquiry in biology.

the basis of the x-ray phase-contrast imaging described here is fresnel diffraction. for samples with minimal absorption, true for insects at the x-ray energies used here, the intensity of an image at a distance d downstream of the sample can be approximated by equation  <dig> :

i = iinc dz]) * r     

where iinc is the incident beam intensity, λ  is the x-ray wavelength, ρ  is the sample density, r is the effective detector resolution, x-y is the image plane, z is the beam direction, and * denotes a convolution. r depends on the detector properties  and the projected source size, σsdl

a major concern in using synchrotron x-rays to study physiological processes in small animals is the effect of the x-rays on the animal. radiation causes molecular damage, including protein and lipid oxidation and gene transmutation; however, the effects depend on dose  <cit> . previous studies show that fruit flies   <cit>  and wasps   <cit>  temporarily lose motor control after a dose of about 1– <dig> kgy, but recover to normal behavior within minutes  <cit>  or hours  <cit> . at exposures greater than  <dig>  kgy, insects do not recover, although it is unclear when death actually occurs  <cit> . feeding patterns are affected after  <dig>   <cit>  to  <dig> gy   <cit> . in one study of d. melanogaster receiving doses of  <dig> gy, metabolic rates were unaffected one day after irradiation  <cit> . in summary, the literature suggests that there are no observable physiological effects at doses less than  <dig> gy, a temporary loss of motor control is observed after ~ <dig>  kgy, and a more permanent loss of motor control occurs at doses greater than  <dig>  kgy. however, in most prior studies of radiation effects on insects , animals have been subjected to full body irradiation; the few studies that examined localized x-rays have used low levels of radiation  <cit> . thus it is unknown how insects are affected by intense, targeted radiation – such as in a synchrotron x-ray beam – on specific parts of the body. furthermore, previous studies focused primarily on effects that occur on a relatively long time scale, usually days after irradiation, and few studies have examined immediate radiation effects. this study strives to answer two questions: what combination of x-ray beam parameters optimizes image quality while minimizing damage to the animal? and under these conditions, how much time is available before the insect is negatively impacted? we varied x-ray parameters and used both co <dig> emission patterns and motor behaviors as proxy indicators to assess physiological damage in four insect species. in addition, we demonstrate the range of studies that can be addressed using this technique by showing examples of high-resolution still imagery and real-time movement of food during ingestion and digestion.

RESULTS
there is a trade-off between image quality and survivorship: higher quality images require greater exposures to radiation, which result in greater harm to the animal. with our video camera and beamline configurations, we found a satisfactory comprise between image quality and survivorship by using  <dig> kev x-rays at  <dig> μw/mm <dig> flux density  and  <dig> m sample-detector distance . with these settings, insects exhibited no negative behavioral effects for a period of about  <dig> minutes. x-rays on the insect's head or thorax caused major changes to the respiratory pattern by about  <dig> minutes . with the beam on the abdomen, no significant changes were observed on the respiratory pattern throughout the full 2-hr trials , or even in two trials that were extended to  <dig> hrs . no thermal effects of the x-rays were observed. food transport and gut structures could be clearly seen using labeled food . in cases where tracking food transport was more important than maximizing the clarity of internal anatomy,  <dig>  kev x-rays were successfully used to visualize iodine-laced food. although not explicitly tested, the shorter wavelength of the x-rays at this setting results in lower absorption and therefore lower impact on the animals. we observed insect feeding under irradiation for more than  <dig> minutes, depending on species and location of the x-rays on the insect.

image quality
thermal effects due to x-ray irradiation
measurements from both the thermocouple and the infrared camera showed no change in temperature to the irradiated insect. this is not surprising, because the nominal power absorbed by the insect is, in the most extreme case, only about 20% of its unirradiated metabolic rate .

 <dig>  

                  except for grasshoppers, reported metabolic rate measurements are averages of all available no-beam co <dig> recordings for each of the four species. for grasshoppers, metabolic rates were not averaged due to the wide mass distribution. conversion from co <dig> output to metabolic rate assumed an energy equivalence of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  j/ml of co <dig> for grasshoppers  <cit> , beetles  <cit> , ants  <cit> , and fruit flies  <cit> . except for grasshoppers and ant abdomen, the beam was larger than the part of the animal being irradiated. under nominal beam intensities, the absorbed power due to the x-ray irradiation was less than 20% of the unirradiated metabolic rate. values are mean ± sd.

x-ray irradiation effects on co <dig> emission patterns
the effect of x-ray radiation dosage on metabolic rates was quantified by examining the effect of incident beam flux density on the ratio of mean co <dig> emission rate during the  <dig> minutes after 'beam on' divided by the mean co <dig> emission rate during the  <dig> minutes before 'beam on'  . except for grasshoppers, the data show a slight but significant increase in average co <dig> emission immediately after 'beam on'. this small increase is probably the result of movement of the insect  as it tried to move away from the beam. however, increasing beam intensity to four-times nominal values had little effect on r <dig> min, suggesting that, although insects appear to sense the beam, there is a considerable safety margin in the capacity to absorb x-rays before major physiological damage occurs during the initial minutes of exposure.

although co <dig> emission patterns during the first minutes after 'beam on' are similar to those prior to irradiation , a major change in the co <dig> emission pattern  was observed in all species after 1000– <dig> s of irradiation. the rs was correlated with dorsoventral head-shaking in the ants and beetles, and a quivering proboscis in fruit flies, but was not correlated with any observable behavior in grasshoppers. we note that for ants, the rs is qualitatively similar to the 'mortal fall' signature observed for ants under thermal stress  <cit> , even though in our case there were no measurable temperature changes  in the animal. shortly after the rs, the co <dig> emission pattern became periodic for all ant samples, and for most of the beetle  and grasshopper  samples. for ants, these periodic patterns resemble discontinuous gas exchange  reported in decapitated ants  <cit> , so we interpret the rs as indicating major brain damage.

time to respiratory signal  varied strongly with incident beam power density ; higher power densities resulted in lower ttrs for all species. the one exception was grasshoppers at the highest power density, which showed a higher ttrs than the other species. figure 4b shows still images taken from the video corresponding to the different incident power densities. together, figures 4a and 4b provide a guide for an experimenter to gauge the compromise between image quality and physiological impact.

ttrs dependence on insect mass
measurements at the nominal beam intensity showed no mass dependence on the ttrs for grasshoppers  and ants . one possible explanation for this lack of pattern is that, in all cases, major portions of the brain were irradiated.

ttrs dependence on x-ray beam location on the insect body
from co <dig> emission measurements in ants, there is no significant difference  in ttrs between having the nominal x-ray beam incident on the head  or the thorax  of the animal. in contrast, no change in co <dig> emission pattern was observed with the x-ray beam incident on the abdomen , even after  <dig> hrs of exposure at the nominal beam intensity. these results are consistent with the fact that in ants, and most insects, most ventilatory activity is controlled by major ganglia of the central nervous system in the head and thorax  <cit> .

x-ray irradiation effects on motor function
using simple behavioral assays, we tested for the presence/absence of righting behavior, defensive behavior, and locomotor ability after a fixed duration of x-ray exposure on the head using nominal beam settings . no changes in behavior were observed within the first  <dig> minutes of exposure. during 6– <dig> minutes of x-ray exposure, ants, beetles and flies progressively lost motor abilities, starting with leg twitches and ranging to full immobility. by contrast, after  <dig> hrs of exposure, the grasshoppers could still right themselves, hop, feed and fly . one major difference between the grasshoppers and all other insects studied is that, because of their large size, only a part of the grasshopper's head was irradiated as opposed to the entire head in the other taxa. we note that, consistent with other studies  <cit> , the loss of locomotor abilities observed in the insects at lower dosages was temporary, indicating radiation-induced lethargy. in many individuals, we observed recovery minutes to hours later, suggesting that radiation damage was at least partially repairable.

discussion
our measurements show that a major change in co <dig> emission pattern, probably indicating major damage to the central nervous system, occurred after about  <dig>  kgy when the insect was exposed on the head or thorax. no change in co <dig> emission was observed if the x-ray beam was incident on the abdomen. the ttrs was independent of mass and species. in ants, beetles and juvenile grasshoppers whose entire heads were irradiated, a cyclic or discontinuous gas exchange  co <dig> emission pattern  <cit>  occurred after the rs. ants have also been shown to exhibit dgc after they are physically decapitated  <cit> , supporting the hypothesis that the x-ray treatment caused major brain damage. in cases where the rs was observed in this study, it is likely that the very high, acute dose of radiation caused profound tissue damage, causing such problems as potassium leakage  <cit>  and leading to effects akin to the 'central nervous system syndrome' known from mammals  <cit> . one puzzling result is that although grasshoppers were no different in ttrs at some power densities, they showed a surprising degree of behavioral control after long periods of irradiation, suggesting a greater tolerance of x-rays to the head. for these animals, whose heads were larger than the size of the x-ray beam, the positioning of the x-ray beam may have missed or only partially damaged parts of the central nervous system, including the major ganglia controlling respiratory and motor function. in particular, partial control of motor behaviors such as walking occur in ganglia in the thorax  <cit> . many of the smaller insects received incidental radiation on the thorax due to geometry during nominal 'head only' trials and exhibited motor loss, lending further weight to this hypothesis.

due to the many factors that contribute to the question of image quality versus survivorship, there is no single set of x-ray parameters that provide an optimal setting. generally, one would like a very small source size to minimize image blur, and an efficient detector system so that a less intense x-ray beam can be used to maximize survivorship. in practice, for insect physiology, the first question is whether the particular internal dynamic or morphology can be visualized by this technique. given the particular source and detector that is available, one usually starts with parameters that give superior image quality. based on our experience with insects, this is usually with an x-ray energy of 10– <dig> kev and a sample-detector distance of 10– <dig> cm. after the desired feature is visualized, the experimenter can optimize the system based on the relative importance of image contrast, spatial resolution, and survivorship.

with our commercially available standard ntsc interlaced video camera  and nominal incident fluxes of  <dig> ×  <dig> ph/s/mm <dig> at  <dig> kev, a  <dig>  ms  exposure time is sufficient to produce a quality image and record many physiological functions. for body functions that require shorter exposure times , higher incident beam fluxes are necessary , in which case insect survivorship will be correspondingly reduced. however, in many cases the total time needed to record such rapid phenomena will be lower. nonetheless, because the current overall detection efficiency is still very low   <cit> , there is ample room for technological improvement with the development of better detectors. in fact, during the course of this manuscript preparation, we acquired a new video camera with the same pixel numbers and sizes, but with twice the sensitivity; thus, we can now obtain high-quality images with only  <dig> ×  <dig> ph/s/mm <dig> incident beam flux . this improvement should double the working time  before any x-ray related effect is observed.

finally, although this study was targeted specifically at insects, these species were chosen primarily as exemplars to introduce the technique to the biological community. synchrotron x-ray phase contrast imaging is broadly applicable to any organism with features on the micron scale and above. however, we urge caution when exploring new systems with this technique; it is crucial to understand the effects of the radiation on the organism when making biological interpretations.

CONCLUSIONS
synchrotron x-ray phase contrast imaging shows great promise as a powerful new tool for internal visualization in biological and medical research. this is the only generally applicable technique that has the necessary spatial and temporal resolutions, penetrating power, and sensitivity to soft tissue that is required to visualize the internal physiology of small living animals on a scale from millimeters to microns. the impact of this technique is just beginning to be seen as it is applied to some of the more easily arranged experiments such as those on the respiratory systems of insects, where it has already had a major impact. the discovery of rhythmic tracheal compressive movements in taxa in which it was previously unknown  <cit>  has opened whole new areas of research, for example those aimed at determining morphological mechanisms of compression and the role of associated convection in insect physiology and evolution. another exciting possibility is the visualization of previously unknown, complex circulatory patterns within insects that have only been inferred before from changes in body surface temperature  <cit> .

current uses of the technique include the analysis of the rapidly moving internal mouthparts of biting insects and the visualization of fluid motion in the pumping organs of fluid feeding insects such as flies and butterflies. the ability to see inside the animal, including the internal workings of jaws, legs, and wing hinges, may be of significant utility in the exploration of functional diversity. although more challenging due to lower density differences, this approach has also yielded impressive x-ray video of insect digestive  and circulatory system function, including the pumping of the tiny pulsatile organs that maintain the internal pressure of the antennae of ants. the first synchrotron research on living vertebrate musculoskeletal systems has recently begun with successful video of the interior bones of the pharynx and skull during fish respiratory pumping. the potential for investigation of model systems in genetics and medicine such as fly, zebrafish, and mouse is considerable, as the natural and normal mechanisms of heart, circulatory, digestive, and locomotor systems can be analyzed in new ways and compared to mutants or disease models that may be used to study human health concerns. ultimately, the ability to clearly visualize internal functions in small animals will have a large impact in both biology and medicine.
