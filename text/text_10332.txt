BACKGROUND
macrophages are an important subset of innate immune cells implicated in host defense against bacterial and viral infections. three of their major functions include phagocytosis and degradation of foreign pathogens, clearance of apoptotic or necrotic host cells, and rapid generation of effector cytokines that orchestrate immune responses. these different functions of macrophages are likely regulated by distinct transcription programs.

serum response factor  is a member of the mads  transcription factor family  <cit>  and is abundantly expressed in a variety of cell types. deletion of srf is embryonic lethal  <cit> . conditional deletion of srf revealed its essential functions in many tissues, including skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle cells  <cit> , neurons  <cit> , and thymocytes  <cit> . at the cellular level, these phenotypes can be attributed to impaired expression of different sets of srf target genes. srf-regulated immediate early genes , such as c-fos, early growth response  <dig>  and junb, are important for cell growth and proliferation  <cit> , while srf-regulated troponin, vinculin , and sm22α participate in muscle-specific contractile functions  <cit> .

with high affinity and specificity, homodimeric srf binds to a consensus cis-element known as a carg box, with the sequence of cc6gg  <cit> . srf regulates diverse programs of gene expression through its association with different accessory factors. the most well-studied cofactors of srf include members of the ternary complex factor  and myocardin families  <cit>  of transcription factors. the tcf family of proteins includes elk <dig>  elk <dig>  and elk <dig> . tcfs respond to mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling initiated by serum or growth factors  <cit>  and is involved in the regulation of iegs. tcfs interact with srf and simultaneously bind to an ets binding site adjacent to the carg box. together, the carg box and the ets site are recognized as the serum response element   <cit> . myocardin family members include myocardin, megakaryoblastic leukemia  <dig>  and mkl <dig> . myocardin is strictly expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle cells, while mkl <dig> and  <dig> exhibit broader expression patterns  <cit> . mkls connect actin dynamics with srf activation  <cit>  and can regulate muscle-specific contractile genes in response to actin polymerization  <cit> . unlike tcfs, mkl <dig> and mkl <dig> do not bind dna sequences directly  <cit> ; instead, they associate with srf to regulate the transcription of target genes. srf interaction with mkls and tcfs is mutually exclusive  <cit> , but recently, mkls were reported to regulate the expressions of some iegs in response to serum induction  <cit> . however, little is known about how these two families coordinate with srf on a genome-wide level.

macrophages express a variety of toll-like receptors  on their cell surface that enable recognition of molecules, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns   <cit> , that are broadly expressed by pathogens, but not by the host. zymosan, a yeast cell wall derivative, induces inflammatory responses in macrophages through binding to the dectin- <dig> receptor or tlr2/ <dig> heterodimers  <cit> . the function of srf in macrophages had not been investigated until our previous studies revealed that srf regulates both general and cell type-restricted cytoskeletal gene expression programs in these cells  <cit> . interestingly, we also found that the srf/mads  motif is highly enriched in the promoters of zymosan-induced genes and that srf indirectly modulates type i interferon signaling in macrophages  <cit> . overall, these studies suggest a possible role of srf in the immune responses of macrophages.

with recent advances in parallel high throughput sequencing, i sought to map out the genome-wide occupancy of srf and its cofactors, mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig>  in this study, rna interference was used to knock down srf, mkl1/ <dig>  and elk <dig>  followed by genome-wide expression profiling analysis and chip-seq experiments to identify the target genes and direct binding sites of these cofactors. together, i demonstrate that the two srf cofactor families, tcfs and mkls, regulate distinct subsets of srf target gene programs during fungal infection in macrophages.

RESULTS
srf is required for macrophage responses to zymosan treatment
in order to identify the transcription factors that are involved in gene regulation in response to fungal infection in macrophages, i stimulated primary macrophages with zymosan for 1 h and harvested rna for microarray analysis. motif analysis on the promoters of genes shown by the array to be induced by zymosan identified the srf/mads  motif as one of the most highly enriched motifs  <cit>  . this is in accordance with the fact that srf functions as an immediate responder to external stimuli such as growth factors or serum. interestingly, srf transcription was increased 2-fold after 1 h of zymosan treatment, but returned to baseline after 6 h of treatment , suggesting that srf activation is an immediate early phase response. to evaluate if this change in mrna expression had a functional effect, i transfected raw <dig>  cells with a reporter construct containing  <dig> tandem srf-binding cis-elements . after 1 h of treatment with zymosan, i found an approximately three-fold increase in reporter activity . next, i evaluated the impact of knocking down srf in zymosan treated elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages by using microarray analysis  <cit> . considering that the transcription of srf was induced quickly and that the srf motif was enriched in the early phase of zymosan treatment, i decided to focus the rest of my study on cells treated with ligand for short periods of time. to identify srf-dependent genes, i filtered the microarray results to isolate the set of transcripts whose expressions were reduced by more than  <dig>  fold with srf-specific sirna after 1 h of zymosan treatment. the resulting subset contained  <dig> non-redundant downregulated genes and  <dig> upregulated genes , which indicates that srf can be induced by zymosan stimulation and that it is an important contributor to macrophage responses to external stimuli.

to investigate which biological functions the srf target genes are involved in, i performed gene ontology  analysis of the srf regulated genes using the david functional annotation tool. the top  <dig> functional annotations are shown in figure 1a . the most significantly enriched item was “actin cytoskeleton organization”, which is a function of srf that has been elucidated in other cell types and in our previous study in quiescent macrophages  <cit> . it is noteworthy that some genes within this subgroup , such as coro1a <cit> , lsp <dig> <cit>  and lcp <dig> <cit> , are preferentially expressed in cells that are of myeloid or hematopoietic origin and regulate macrophage specific functions such as phagocytosis or migration. moreover, other go terms that are closely related to macrophage specific functions were also significantly enriched such as “regulation of cell adhesion”  and “response to external stimulus” .

i validated the expression changes of some representative target genes by quantitative pcr . as expected, several groups of target genes were confirmed as srf dependent, including:  general actin cytoskeleton related genes such as cofilin <dig>  and vcl, and the migration related gene, lymphocyte-specific protein  <dig> ;  adhesion related genes like thrombospondin  <dig> ;  genes related to stimulus responses such as il <dig> and egr3; and  genes related to other functions, including fms-related tyrosine kinase  <dig>  and fos-like antigen  <dig>  . all of these results indicate that srf is required for intact expression of genes closely related to macrophage functions.

go analysis of the genes upregulated by srf knockdown under zymosan treated conditions resulted in the identification of more generic terms such as “cellular process”, “nucleosome assembly” and “regulation of metabolic process” . besides regulating the transcription of target genes, srf is known to regulate some mirnas  <cit>  associated with altered expression of mrnas and proteins. the genes upregulated upon srf knockdown could potentially be downstream targets of srf through the regulation of mirnas. using ingenuity pathway analysis, i compiled a list of  <dig> overrepresented mirnas for the  <dig> upregulated genes, which included mir-16-5p, mir- <dig>  mir-205-5p, mir- <dig>  mir-291a-3p, mir-204-5p, mir- <dig>  mir-615-3p, mir-424-3p and mir-10a-5p. although there is no current literature linking any of these mirnas to srf, it would be interesting to test, in future studies, whether these mirnas are actually novel targets of srf.

mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig> regulate different subsets of genes in zymosan treated macrophages
previous studies of srf in muscle cells suggested that srf participates in different regulatory programs by associating with different transcription cofactors. this mechanism enables srf to toggle between regulating cell proliferation and growth and orchestrating actin cytoskeletal and contractile homeostasis. i next sought to investigate accessary factors utilized for srf function in response to zymosan stimulation in macrophages. i focused on two well-known srf associated cofactor families: the myocardin and tcf families of transcription cofactors.

mkl <dig> and mkl <dig>  share many redundant functions  <cit>  and are both highly expressed in primary macrophages. unlike srf, mrna levels of mkl <dig> and mkl <dig> stay constant after zymosan treatment . because of their many redundancies, i used an sirna pool targeting both mkl <dig> and mkl <dig> to knock down their expressions simultaneously to better assess their role in macrophages . elk <dig> is the dominantly expressed member of the tcf family in primary macrophages . similar to mkl1/ <dig>  elk <dig> expression does not change during zymosan treatment . transfection of macrophages with elk4-specific sirnas significantly reduced elk <dig> expression compared with control sirna transfected samples . i also confirmed that the knockdown effect is specific for elk <dig> and that mrna expression for elk <dig> and elk <dig> were unaffected . following confirmation of the sirna knockdown efficiencies, i performed gene expression array analysis on my samples to compare the gene expression changes in mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig> knockdown cells versus control sirna transfected cells after zymosan treatment for 1 h.

using  <dig>  fold reduction as a cutoff, i identified a total of  <dig> genes that were mkl1/ <dig> dependent  and  <dig> genes that were elk <dig> dependent . these results indicate that the absence of these cofactors would have an impact on zymosan induced gene expression in macrophages.

to check if mkl1/ <dig> contributes to srf related functions in macrophages, i compared the  <dig> mkl1/ <dig> target genes with the  <dig> srf target genes. this analysis identified  <dig> mkl1/ <dig> target genes that were also dependent on srf for their expression . go analysis of these  <dig> genes identified the term of “actin cytoskeleton organization” as the top hit. when i performed go analysis on the mkl1/ <dig> target genes that were independent of srf expression, i found that “positive regulation of biological process” ranked as the first significant term . taken together, these results suggest that mkl1/ <dig> could coordinate with srf to regulate cytoskeleton related target genes, but may also have other generic functions independent of srf.

by comparing the  <dig> elk <dig> target genes with the  <dig> srf target genes, i identified  <dig> genes that were dependent on both elk <dig> and srf for their expression . go analysis of these  <dig> genes identified two significantly enriched terms: “response to external stimulus” and “regulation of transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter”. this result indicates that elk <dig> is involved in a different aspect of srf function than mkl1/ <dig>  the fact that elk <dig> dependent genes are enriched for the go term related to stress responses in gene ontology analysis is consistent with our finding that besides the srf motif, the elk <dig> motif is also highly enriched in the promoters of zymosan-induced genes in primary macrophages . since the majority of elk <dig> dependent target genes are not dependent on srf for expression, elk <dig> may have some srf independent functions in macrophages. similar go analysis on the srf independent elk <dig> target genes showed the term “cellular process” shifted to the top, followed by “response to stress” and “cell division”, etc. .

taken together, these findings support the view that mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig> are involved in distinct functions of srf in zymosan treated macrophages. specifically, mkl1/ <dig> is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, elk <dig> contributes to establishing responses to external stresses, and both sides constitute important functions of srf in macrophages. moreover, i found that both mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig> have roles that are independent of srf and that they may perform these roles independently or in coordination with other transcription factors. additional work will be necessary to explore how srf and these cofactors work on the genome directly and also to identify other potential cofactors.

mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig> dependent target genes show different responses to zymosan induction
similar to the srf target genes, i also validated representative target genes of mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig> by q-pcr. i verified the mkl1/ <dig> dependence of a subset of genes with functional annotations linked to actin cytoskeleton organization, including cfl <dig>  dstn, vcl, and thbs <dig>  all four of these genes are highly expressed in macrophages in the basal state. while the former two genes were not regulated by zymosan, the latter two were slightly upregulated by zymosan treatment. expression of all  <dig> genes was reduced 30-60% by mkl1/ <dig> knockdown . moreover, elk <dig> expression was not required for the expression of genes related to actin cytoskeleton organization such as vcl and cnn <dig> .

i also verified the elk <dig> dependence of a subset of stimulus response genes, including egr <dig>  c-fos, il <dig>  and egr <dig> . the expression of these four genes can be induced as much as  <dig> fold by zymosan, in contrast to actin related genes. although not revealed by microarray evaluation, i found by q-pcr that knocking down mkl1/ <dig> also impaired the expression of some stimulus response genes such as egr <dig> and il <dig> .

generation of a blrp-mkl1-bira stable cell line for chip-seq analysis in raw <dig>  macrophages
while knockdown experiments combined with mrna expression analysis helped to identify the genes whose expressions are dependent on srf, mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig>  it could not tell me whether these dependencies are through direct transcriptional regulation or through a secondary effect. it has been reported  that srf regulates the expression of itself  <cit>  and that this effect is dependent on both mkl and tcf cofactors  <cit> . thus, it is possible that knocking down mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig> could cause reduced expressions of some target genes through reducing the expression of srf. as shown in figure 3c, knocking down mkl1/ <dig> reduced the expression of srf more than 50%, under both basal and zymosan treated conditions . knocking down elk <dig> showed a similar effect . this result is consistent with previous reports that there is an mkl and tcf-dependent positive feedback loop for srf-dependent autoregulation  <cit> .

to identify the direct targets of srf and its cofactors on a genome-wide level, i performed chip followed by high throughput sequencing of the enriched dna fragments . mkl <dig> and mkl <dig> do not bind dna sequences directly  <cit> ; instead, they associate with srf to regulate the transcription of target genes. as the binding affinity of mkl1/ <dig> to the dna fragment is relatively weak, conventional chip assay with mkl <dig> antibody failed to provide sufficient enrichment on known target genes in macrophages . to this end, i generated a blrp-tagged mkl <dig> expression vector and transfected it into raw <dig>  cells to generate a stable cell line exogenously expressing blrp-mkl <dig> . a tev-based chip strategy was then performed for mkl <dig> using this stable cell line, followed by sequencing analysis. i note here that srf and elk <dig> directly bind dna, so chip-seq using commercial antibodies against endogenous proteins were possible in the mkl <dig> overexpressed bira stable cell line.

stable clones with highly expressed blrp-mkl <dig> were identified and selected by rt-qpcr with primers targeting the blrp sequence . blrp expression was approximately  <dig> times higher in the stable cell line compared to parental bira cells and the blrp mrna can be further induced as much as  <dig> fold following 1 h of zymosan treatment. mkl <dig> expression levels in this stable clone were twice as high as in the bira parental cell line under basal conditions and were induced  <dig>  fold after 1 h of zymosan treatment . the high expression of mkl <dig> protein was also confirmed by western blot .

global localization of srf, mkl <dig> and elk <dig> in macrophages
all the chip-seq assays were performed in zymosan treated blrp-mkl1-bira stable cells. using a false discovery rate of  <dig> %, i identified a total of  <dig> srf-specific peaks,  <dig> mkl1-specific peaks and  <dig> elk4-specific peaks . each of these peaks were then annotated to the closest refseq gene observed. among the  <dig> srf-bound peaks, i found  <dig> and  <dig> peaks that were also associated with mkl <dig> and elk <dig> binding, respectively. furthermore,  <dig> srf peaks were associated with both mkl <dig> and elk <dig> . there were also a number of srf associated peaks that did not overlap with mkl <dig> and elk <dig> binding sites, indicating that there may be other cofactors utilized by srf. for mkl <dig>  the majority of the peaks  were associated with srf. however, the percentage for elk <dig> association with srf peaks was relatively lower , indicating that elk <dig> may have other functions independent of srf and could have other co-regulators  <cit> .

motif analysis of the  <dig> nearest genes associated with srf peaks by opossum recovered many transcription factor binding sites . as expected, srf and elk <dig> were among the top hits, together with gabpa, nfκb, staf, tead <dig>  nfya, rela, creb <dig>  stat <dig> and rreb <dig> . some of the overrepresented tfs have been reported as cofactors of srf already, including nfκb, tead <dig>  nfya and rela  <cit> . my study also revealed additional potential cofactors of srf, such as gabpa, staf, creb <dig>  stat <dig> and rreb <dig>  the most highly enriched motif for mkl <dig> bound genes was srf, followed by mef2a, nfκb, stat <dig>  irf <dig>  mizf, foxf <dig>  gabpa, nfya, rela and creb <dig> . most of the overrepresented tfbss of mkl <dig> peaks coincided with those of srf , suggesting that mkl <dig> might be involved in the same complex with srf and other cofactors. however, there is also the possibility that mkl <dig> might interact with the novel cofactors, independently of srf, to regulate specific target genes.

for elk <dig> bound genes, elk <dig> and srf motifs were significantly enriched, together with nfya and gabpa . nfya has been predicted to interact with both elk <dig> and elk <dig>  <cit> . gabpa, another ets-domain transcription factor, has been reported to show a substantial overlap in promoter occupancy with elk <dig> and elk <dig>  <cit> . the association of elk <dig> with both nfya and gabpa motifs suggests that, besides srf, these factors could be new partners of elk <dig> in macrophages and should be experimentally validated in future work.

classification of srf peaks with respect to the locations of genes revealed that a large fraction of srf peaks were located in intergenic regions  and introns . approximately  <dig> % of the peaks were located in the vicinity of promoters  and only  <dig> % in exons . this distribution pattern is consistent with our previous srf chip-seq studies in quiescent primary macrophages  <cit> . a large fraction of the peaks seen in primary macrophages  were also identified in my srf chip-seq in blrp-mkl1-bira cells. genomic annotation of mkl <dig> binding sites indicated a distribution pattern similar to srf peaks.  <dig> % of the mkl <dig> peaks were located in intergenic regions,  <dig> % in introns,  <dig> % in promoters and a very small fraction in exons  . however, the genomic distribution of elk <dig> binding sites differed significantly from that of srf and mkl <dig>  approximately  <dig> % of the elk <dig> peaks were located in promoters,  <dig> % in intergenic regions,  <dig> % in introns and a very small fraction in exons  . this data indicates that elk <dig>  unlike srf and mkl <dig>  may function primarily through promoter-proximal regions.

the fact that there is a difference in the number of srf chip-seq peaks in intergenic regions versus those of elk <dig>  indicates that srf participates in some unique transcription regulation mechanisms independent of its well-known cofactor, elk <dig>  there are two possible explanations for this phenomenon. first, srf could function at distal enhancers for its regulated genes. this possibility was verified by our previous study showing that srf binds together with pu. <dig> at distal sites to regulate cell-type specific cytoskeletal genes using an enhancer-based strategy  <cit> . second, since many non-coding rnas  are found in intergenic regions, it is possible that srf regulates the expression of ncrnas. to test this notion, i examined if there are annotated ncrna loci within 20 kb of the  <dig> srf intergenic binding sites. my in silico analysis showed that a significant portion  of the intergenic peaks were associated with annotated ncrnas . a total of  <dig> unique ncrnas  were associated with intergenic srf peaks, indicating the possibility of regulation of these ncrnas by srf. a majority of the ncrnas  identified are classified as long non-coding rnas , while  <dig> are mirnas . in support of the possibility of srf regulation of ncrnas, the previously reported srf target mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were on the mirna list generated by my in silico analysis.

ucsc genome browser images of srf binding to  <dig> of its target genes  are shown in figure 5a. three representative mkl <dig> peaks associated with srf, vcl and cyr <dig> are shown in figure 5b. three representative elk <dig> peaks on srf, c-fos and egr <dig> are shown in figure 5c.

mkl <dig> and elk <dig> are dedicated to different transcription programs in macrophages
to check the functional significance of dna binding of srf, mkl <dig> and elk <dig>  i used the functional annotation tool, david, to assess genes associated with binding peaks of srf, mkl <dig> and elk <dig>  respectively. the top  <dig> most relevant go terms of biological process for each target gene list are presented in figure 6a . srf associated genes were overrepresented with go terms of “actin cytoskeleton organization” and “gene expression”. the go term “actin cytoskeleton organization” was also selectively enriched in mkl <dig> associated genes. in contrast, “gene expression” appeared as one of the most highly enriched terms for elk <dig> associated genes.

by using kegg pathway analysis for the srf, mkl <dig>  and elk <dig> bound genes, i found that mkl <dig> and elk <dig> associated genes contribute to different pathways related to srf. for example, srf and mkl <dig> associated genes showed overlapping and enriched pathways of “focal adhesion” and “adherens junction”. in contrast, srf associated genes were enriched in the “mapk signaling pathway” with elk <dig> associated genes. the kegg term of “pathways in cancer” was commonly seen in the analysis of all of the  <dig> groups of target genes . these functional differences can be illustrated by different target genes regulated by the two different cofactors. actb is an example of a “focal adhesion” kegg pathway molecule and egr <dig> is a representative “mapk signaling pathway” molecule. each of these genes are independently regulated by mkl <dig> and elk <dig> as indicated by genome browser images. as shown in figure 6c, actb is an mkl1-dependent and elk4-independent srf target gene. in contrast, egr <dig> is bound by elk <dig> and srf, but not mkl <dig> 

i further confirmed the occupancy of mkl <dig> and elk <dig> on different target genes by chip-qpcr and also compared the dynamic binding of mkl <dig> and elk <dig> before and after zymosan treatment. my experiments confirmed the abundant enrichment of mkl <dig> on the promoters of srf and vcl. the observed enrichments were high under basal conditions and were further enhanced after zymosan treatment . this was in accordance with the increased expression of mkl <dig> in response to zymosan treatment in the blrp-mkl1-bira cell line. conventional chip analysis using primers flanking the peaks also confirmed elk <dig> binding to the promoters of c-fos and egr <dig> . although the mrna expressions of these two target genes can be highly induced by zymosan treatment, elk <dig> occupancy levels remained constant on these two promoters.

discussion
in this study, i analyzed the role of srf, and representative members of its cofactor families in macrophages, in the context of zymosan stimulation. using a knockdown strategy coupled with gene expression array analysis, i identified target genes whose expressions were dependent on the intact expression of srf, mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig>  respectively. chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing allowed the identification of direct target genes of srf, mkl <dig> and elk <dig>  taken together, my results indicate that mkl <dig> and elk <dig> contribute to distinct aspects of srf functions in macrophages.

here, i show that srf mediates a response to zymosan stimulation in primary macrophages. the transcription of srf was increased by zymosan treatment in an early phase, similar to other highly characterized immediate early genes in the literature such as c-fos and jun. identification of the srf binding element, the carg box, as one of the most highly enriched motifs in the promoters of zymosan induced genes suggests that srf may play important roles in zymosan responses in macrophages. using knockdown analysis combined with gene profiling, i identified different target gene sets for srf and members of two well-known families of srf accessory cofactors: the myocardin family members, mkl1/ <dig>  and the tcf family member, elk <dig>  with regard to the effects of knocking down srf, i found that different gene sets with macrophage specific functions were targets of srf, including genes related to migration, phagocytosis, adhesion and responses to stimuli. in agreement with previous studies performed in other cell types, mkl1/ <dig> regulates the expression of many genes related to actin cytoskeleton organization in macrophages. these genes showed high basal expression and little to no induction in response to zymosan treatment. in contrast, i found that elk <dig> target genes are overrepresented in the go term of “response to stress”. i validated some representative elk <dig> target genes and found that the expressions of these genes were highly induced by zymosan treatment and that their inductions were heavily dependent on intact elk <dig> expression. taken together, it’s proposed that mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig> contribute to different functions in the quiescent state compared to the context of an inflammatory response. moreover, the microarray data revealed that both mkl1/ <dig> and elk <dig> have some srf independent functions and that these functions may involve other novel cofactors.

one of the limitations of microarray analysis is that it is difficult to differentiate the direct target genes from the secondary ones. for example, srf expression itself can be affected by knocking down mkl1/ <dig> or elk <dig>  i also noticed that some elk <dig> dependent target genes showed decreased expression with mkl1/ <dig> loss, which is probably a secondary effect of srf expression downregulation. therefore, i performed chip-seq analysis to further identify direct target genes of srf and its cofactors and to explore novel partners of the three transcription factors.

motif analysis of the srf bound peaks identified in my chip-seq experiment revealed a set of transcription factors that could be cofactors of srf besides elk <dig>  some of these factors have already been reported as cofactors of srf. for example, srf acts in conjunction with tead <dig> for cardiac muscle gene regulation  <cit> , the interaction of srf and nfya has been verified in vitro <cit> , and the interaction of srf and nfκb has been observed on the il-2r enhancer in t lymphocytes  <cit> . in addition, the nfκb subunit, p <dig> , synergizes with srf to activate an sre containing reporter  <cit> . my study also revealed several additional potential cofactors of srf, including gabpa, staf, creb <dig>  stat <dig> and rreb <dig>  an independent chip-seq study in jurkat t cells found that a large fraction of srf peaks occur within 100 bp of gabp peaks, suggesting that srf may interact physically with gabp  <cit> . although creb has not been reported as directly interacting with srf, creb binding protein  has been found constitutively bound to the sre on the c-fos promoter  <cit> . rreb <dig> and srf were also both predicted to interact with the same factor, mef <dig>  <cit> . these references provide some evidence for my hypothesis that srf may interact with cofactors outside of the myocardin and tcf families.

our previous chip-seq study of srf in primary macrophages indicated a critical role of srf in promoting hematopoietic-cell-restricted gene expression through binding at distal enhancers, while modulation of generally expressed genes occurred at promoters  <cit> . a large fraction of the srf peaks in primary quiescent macrophages also showed up in my chip-seq experiment in the blrp-mkl1-bira cells. moreover, i also found that srf-binding sites are not restricted to promoter regions, but are preferentially located in intergenic regions of the mouse genome. through mapping of the intergenic peaks to the mouse genome, i found that  <dig> % of the peaks were associated with annotated ncrnas, of which, lncrnas constitute the major fraction. a list of mirnas were also associated with intergenic srf peaks, including the known srf targets, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  <cit> . while mkl <dig> has a genomic distribution pattern similar to srf, as previously reported  <cit> , elk <dig> showed a relatively larger fraction of occupancy on promoters. in particular, gabpa and nfya motifs were found to be enriched on elk <dig> bound gene promoters, suggesting a possible partnership of the two transcription factors with elk <dig> 

in addition to validating the mkl <dig> and elk <dig> binding sites from my chip-seq experiment, i also assessed the binding of these factors in the context of zymosan stimulation. with regard to mrna expression, mkl <dig> dependent genes showed high basal expression and little to no induction in response to zymosan treatment. by chip-qpcr, i found that mkl <dig> binding to the promoters of its target genes was increased after zymosan treatment. considering the higher expression of mkl <dig> after zymosan treatment in the blrp-mkl1-bira stable cells, this enhanced occupancy may reflect an increased expression of blrp-mkl <dig> protein. in contrast, elk <dig> target gene mrna levels can be highly induced by zymosan treatment. however, in the basal state, elk <dig> is already bound to target genes poised for zymosan induction. i speculate that additional events, such as post-translational modification of the srf-cofactor complex, occur upon zymosan treatment to promote the function of elk4-srf at these loci. kasza, et al. reported similar results in which elk <dig> and srf were both found on the zc3h12a promoter and that their binding was also not increased upon il-1β stimulation  <cit> . these results indicate that transcription factor recruitment may not be a key regulatory event in response to inflammatory stimuli.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this is the first study to examine the functions of srf and its key cofactors simultaneously on a genome-wide level through both chip-sequencing and transcriptome analysis. the overall view of the genome-wide locations of srf, mkl <dig> and elk <dig> has been constructed and the results suggest that srf utilizes mkl <dig> to fulfill steady state cellular functions, including cytoskeletal organization, and utilizes elk <dig> to facilitate acute responses to external infection. previous studies of srf largely focused on skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle cells and neurons. this project sheds light on the functions of srf, mkl <dig> and elk <dig> in macrophages, indicating their potential roles for both cellular homeostasis and stress responses in immune cells.
