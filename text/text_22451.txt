BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small, ~18– <dig> nt. noncoding rnas that are found in all eukaryotes and are cleaved from larger ~ <dig> nt. precursors via the action of dicer enzyme . micrornas are thought to degrade messenger rnas via eliciting mrna degradation , or to arrest translation of the mrnas . although a number of microrna targets have been identified in plants, c. elegans and drosophila  <cit> , only one mammalian microrna target has yet been validated  <cit> .

five different papers have recently appeared that used computational approaches to predict microrna targets in drosophila  <cit> , and mammals  <cit> . these studies only considered hits occurring within 3'-utr regions that were conserved across related species, and favored or required a short region of perfect complementarity towards the 5'-end of micrornas. however, there is reason to suspect that the rules governing microrna-target interactions may not be universal. for example, in plants, most of the known micrornas bind in a perfect or near-perfect manner to mrna targets located within the protein coding region   <cit> . in contrast, in c. elegans  <cit>  and drosophila  <cit> , known micrornas lack long stretches  of complementarity with their targets and generally interact within the 3'-untranslated region . furthermore, whereas the 5'-ends of many drosophila micrornas recognize 5– <dig> nt. common motifs within the target, these motifs are not a general feature of mammalian micrornas  <cit> . thus, it is conceivable that human microrna targets do not follow the same constraints as observed in c. elegans and drosophila.

in the present paper, we have performed an unbiased statistical analysis of the manner in which human micrornas interact complementarily with human mrnas present in the ncbi human refseq database, looking for characteristics that differ significantly as compared with scrambled versions of the same microrna sequences. the results demonstrate several novel features of human microrna-mrna interactions that differ from c. elegans and drosophila, and identify a short-list of promising candidate microrna-mrna target pairs that are unlikely to have arisen by chance.

RESULTS
population-wide statistical analyses were first carried out by examining the types of complementary interactions that occur between the set of micrornas listed in lagos-quintana et al  <cit> , and the set of human refseq mrnas downloaded in august  <dig>  to obtain a fuller list of outlier mrnas, analyses were repeated using all human micrornas listed on the sanger microrna repository  <cit>  and the set of human refseq mrnas listed as of december  <dig>  <cit> .

to define the types of interactions that can occur by chance, ten independent sets  of scrambled microrna counterpart sequences were generated and examined for complementarity with the mrna population. our underlying assumption is that scrambled sequences will hit mrna at random and define the "noise" level in any given situation, whereas microrna sequences will hit the same number of "noise" interactions plus any true targets. unless otherwise noted, the scrambled sequences were random permutations of the microrna sequences, keeping constant the overall nucleotide composition. because micrornas have a distinctive nonrandom di-nucleotide composition, we also confirmed that key findings were obtained when using scrambled sequences that had similar di-nucleotide composition to the micrornas.

 <dig>  human micrornas tend to have longer exact hits upon mrnas than do their scrambled counterparts
first, we characterized the length distribution of exact complementarity between the population of mrnas vs. the set of nonredundant micrornas . micrornas produced significantly longer exact "hits" on mrnas than their scrambled counterparts when g:u matches were excluded . there was an excess number of hits in the microrna set relative to scrambled control sequences at all exact hit lengths , and the difference became proportionately greater at longer hit lengths . when micrornas were compared to scrambled sequences that matched the di-nucleotide composition of micrornas, similar results were obtained. in contrast, this trend was not observed when g:u matches were included . experimental studies suggest that rna interference and arrested translation can still be elicited when small rnas are modified to replace a number of watson-crick base pairs by g:u matches  <cit> . on the other hand, g:u matches have distinctive binding energy and spatial orientation  <cit> . unless otherwise qualified, "exact hits" will refer to complementarity without g:u matches.

 <dig>  constructing an outlier set of micrornas based on cut-offs of exact hit length, gapped blast score and presence of multiple hits
as shown in figure  <dig>  there are a total of  <dig>   <dig> microrna hits upon refseq sequences hitting exactly ≥ <dig> bases in a row, compared to  <dig>  hits produced by scrambled microrna sequences. the difference  is highly significant  and suggests that about 1/ <dig> of the total hits in this "10+ set" occur upon "true" biological mrna targets. our approach is to identify further the mrnas that represent statistical outliers  within this larger "10+ set" by comparing properties of hits made by the set of microrna sequences vs. the set of scrambled sequences. at any given parametric value, the number of hits observed in the microrna set, minus the number of hits in the scrambled set, provides an estimate of the number of true microrna targets that satisfy that parametric value. we examined three different hit properties – a) exact hit length, b) gapped blast score and c) presence of multiple hits – both alone and combined with each other. starting from the "10+ set" estimated to contain only 26% true targets , we added additional criteria to compile a list of candidates estimated to contain over 80% true targets.

a) exact hit length
the most important single parameter for discriminating hits produced by micrornas vs. scrambled sequences appears to be exact hit length. at a cut-off of  <dig> exact hit length, there were  <dig> mrnas hit by the microrna set that satisfied this criterion, vs. an average of  <dig>  mrnas hit by each of the scrambled sequence sets . stated another way, this criterion gives a discrimination ratio of  <dig>  to  <dig>  a similar discrimination ratio was observed when comparing scrambled sequences maintaining the same di-nucleotide composition as the micrornas.

b) gapped-blast score
overall complementarity of the microrna-mrna alignment was also examined within the "10+ set" of individual mrnas exhibiting exact microrna hits of at least  <dig> bases in a row. a modified gapped-blast algorithm  <cit>  was used to compute the optimal alignment, employing a weighted score that takes gaps and mismatches into account . although the two curves overlap quite a bit, their means are significantly different from each other , and the microrna distribution exhibits a discrete "tail" at higher scores that differs significantly from the scrambled distribution .

c) multiple hits
in lower organisms, individual validated microrna targets tend to receive multiple hits by distinct micrornas  <cit> . mrna sequences within the "10+ set" were hit by multiple nonredundant micrornas more often than by their scrambled counterparts, and this was particularly striking when the hits were located close together .

d) combining parameters
when combined, all three parameters  gave better discrimination power than using any single feature, supporting the idea that they are relevant to identifying biologically relevant mrna targets. we examined three different combinations of parameter cut-off values: 1) one combination consisted of targets with multiple hits from distinct micrornas less than  <dig> bases apart, with at least one exact hit ≥ <dig> bases and with at least one gapped blast score ≥ <dig> . for the next two lists, we scored only exact hits ≥ <dig> bases long and that occurred ≤ <dig> times within the entire mrna population; this minimized "noise" arising from common or low-complexity target sequences, albeit at the cost of removing some target sequences that are shared within protein families. 2) criteria required two or more hits from distinct micrornas ≤ <dig> bases apart, at least one exact hit ≥ <dig> bases and one gapped-blast score of ≥ <dig> . 3) this required hits ≤ <dig> bases apart, at least one exact hit ≥ <dig> bases, and at least one gapped-blast score > 89% of the best-possible score including g:u matches .

all three approaches produced lists of outlier mrnas that had overlapping members, shared similar characteristics and exhibited similar discrimination ratios. for simplicity and robustness, these have been combined  into a single list consisting of  <dig> outlier mrnas . the combined list was hit by almost the entire set of nonredundant micrornas . in contrast, scrambled counterpart sequences hit an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  targets and were represented by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nonredundant sequences. the combined outlier set gives an overall discrimination ratio of  <dig>  to  <dig>  meaning that  <dig> of the  <dig> mrnas are in excess of the number that could be reasonably expected by chance, hence should be accurately assigned as true targets for one or more micrornas. see  for additional data files including a fully annotated outlier mrna set, a list of all microrna hits upon this set , and a list of the nonredundant micrornas together with their putative mrna targets.

 <dig>  characterizing the mrna outlier set
the  <dig> mrnas in the outlier set had a larger number of microrna hits per kilobase of target sequence than did the scrambled sequences . as well, individual micrornas hit multiple  distinct members of the outlier set, which again happened significantly more often than by chance . these findings indicate that the outlier mrnas are different as a whole from the mrnas that were hit by scrambled counterparts, even those that satisfied the same cut-off criteria.

the outlier mrna set contained very similar types of targets as predicted by previous computational studies  <cit> , including members of the same gene families. for example, lewis et al.  <cit>  described e2f <dig> as a candidate target whereas we found e2f <dig> . transcription factors  and nucleic acid-binding proteins are among the top predicted microrna targets. as well, many other functional categories are represented including kinases, receptors and other signal transduction proteins, membrane and cytokeletal proteins, and effectors of differentiation . however, surprisingly, we found that the human candidate microrna target list also had some features that differed significantly from the known targets in c. elegans and drosophila. for example, there was no preference for microrna hits to be located within 3'-untranslated regions: 5% of hits were located in the 5'-utr, 1% at the 5'-utr/coding junction, 67% in the protein coding region, 1% at the coding/3'-utr junction, and only 26% in the 3'-utr. this distribution was not significantly different from hits produced by the scrambled sequences. as well, the best microrna hits upon candidate mrna targets did not have relatively better target complementarity near their 5'-end: only 13% of hits had ≥  <dig> exact hit length starting at position  <dig> or  <dig> relative to the 5'end of the microrna .

microrna  <dig> is particularly interesting because it hits  <dig> distinct targets on the candidate list, of which a disproportionate number  are in the signal transduction category and three of these are related to gtpase activation , g protein gamma  <dig>  and hypothetical protein flj <dig> – containing rhogap and sh <dig> domains; table 1). a recent study showing that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are both underexpressed in colorectal neoplasia  <cit>  had previously proposed the first two of these candidates as potential targets. interestingly, the third target found here is not only novel  but is hit by both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in close proximity , further suggesting that this is likely to be a true biological target for microrna regulation.

discussion
by comparing how the population of micrornas vs. their scrambled counterparts interact with the population of human refseq mrna sequences, we estimate that the probability of detecting a true microrna target increases a) as the length of exact complementarity of a "hit" between microrna and target increases, b) as the overall complementarity of a "hit" increases , and c) as two or more distinct micrornas hit the same mrna in closer proximity. targets in the outlier mrna set also received more hits per unit length and more multiple hits from distinct micrornas than expected by chance. finally, we found cases in which an individual microrna hit multiple mrnas that belonged to the same functional class. the analysis suggests that target complementarity is a major factor in identifying biologically relevant mrna targets: as values of each parameter increase, the difference between the number of hits in the microrna set vs. the scrambled set increases steadily, and combining all three parameters gives better discrimination power than using any single feature.

so far, these conclusions agree with five different papers that used computational approaches to predict microrna targets in drosophila  <cit> , and mammals  <cit> , using different strategies, criteria and filters than employed here. however, three significant differences were observed between human mrnas in the outlier set and drosophila targets: 1) human micrornas hit mrnas with exact hit lengths extending much longer than observed in drosophila, up to and including perfect complementarity. 2) human micrornas hit candidate mrna targets within the protein coding region about 2/ <dig> of the time.  3) the stretches of perfect complementarity within microrna hits in the outlier mrna set were not biased to occur near the 5'-end of the microrna. this is not necessarily at odds with earlier analyses, since our outlier set includes only perfect stretches of  <dig> bases or more, and the 5' end may be more critical in those cases where only a short perfect stretch of complementarity exists.

one might object that our ability to detect certain trends seen in drosophila and c. elegans was simply obscured by the fact that we searched the large sequence space represented by all human mrna sequences – the larger the sequence space, the greater the chance that any given target criterion will be satisfied by scrambled sequences, hence the more difficult it can be to detect true targets above the noise level. we agree that this can be a problem using very large sequence databases, such as the human est database or the entire human genome. as well, using cut-off levels of parameter distributions to define the candidate list probably excludes many true human mrna targets. however, human refseq was demonstrably not too large for our analysis, since very strong trends were observed in a variety of other parameters .

based upon sequence complementarity, at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> members of the outlier set are predicted to represent true microrna targets . indeed, since this paper was first submitted for publication, one of the mrnas on this list, hoxb <dig>  has been experimentally confirmed  <cit> . note, however, that accessory factors in the risc might also help to determine which potential mrna targets will actually be sites of regulation in vivo. as well, microrna and target must be expressed in the same times and places in adequate concentrations; secondary structure of the mrna target region may be important  <cit> ; see also  <cit> ; and rna a-to-i editing  <cit>  might operate to prevent certain target sequences from binding micrornas adequately.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the population-wide characteristics of microrna-mrna sequence complementarity indicate that micrornas recognize a subset of human mrna sequences better than expected by chance. this outlier set does obey a number of properties expected for true biological mrna targets, but does not show a bias for target regions to be located within the 3'-utr of the mrna, and stretches of perfect complementarity are not biased towards the 5'-end of the microrna. if the candidate list is representative of the full set of biologically significant targets, then the total number of mrna targets in humans may be much greater than previously proposed  <cit> .
