BACKGROUND
the capacity to regenerate organs or tissues after injury is an intrinsic property of all organisms and varies between different species. whereas in fish this capability is preserved from larval stages to adulthood , in other vertebrates, such as the frog, it is present only in larval stages  <cit>  or is almost completely lost, as in mammals. after injury, different organisms can thus respond either through regeneration  or repair   <cit> . this balance depends on the cellular composition of the affected tissue, the physiological context, and the age of the individual  <cit> . it has been shown that the ability of progenitor cells to be activated and to differentiate at the injury site tilts the balance towards regeneration  <cit> . however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the maintenance and differentiation of progenitor populations and how regeneration is triggered and controlled at the injury site are poorly understood. recently, the lateral line of the zebrafish has emerged as a powerful model for studying the interactions between cells extrinsic or intrinsic to the organ during development and regeneration .

the lateral line is a mechanosensory system located on the surface of the fish. it is able to detect and localize water movements around the body surface and is implicated in several behaviors, such as navigation, schooling rheotaxis, and predator avoidance  <cit> . this system is anatomically divided into an anterior lateral line, located on the head, and the posterior lateral line , distributed along the trunk and tail of the fish. the vast majority of the knowledge about this sensory system comes from the study of its posterior component. the pll of zebrafish arises from a migratory primordium  that, during late embryonic stages, deposits seven or eight sensory organs called neuromasts linked by a single cell-wide line of interneuromastic cells   <cit> . primary neuromasts are named by their position, from l <dig>  to l <dig>  each neuromast is composed of a central core of hair cells surrounded by mantle cells, supporting cells, and progenitor cells, and is innervated by the peripheral projections of afferent neurons located in the pll ganglion . together, these peripheral projections form the pll nerve .

the number of neuromasts increases during larval development from the initial eight, arranged in a single anteroposterior line, to over  <dig>  distributed in four lines  <cit> . the increase in neuromast number is made possible by three mechanisms . the first mechanism involves the migration of a secondary primordium , which travels from the head to the anus depositing additional neuromasts  adjacent to the primary ones  <cit> . the second process is the formation of intercalary neuromasts. the intercalary neuromasts arise from primary incs that are displaced ventrally from the horizontal myoseptum—where they were originally deposited—by the deposition of secondary neuromasts. the displacement separates the incs from the underlying schwann cells , stimulating their proliferation and differentiation into new neuromasts . the first intercalary neuromast appears between l <dig> and l <dig>  and they progressively fill all of the intersomitic borders between l <dig> and l <dig> that were left vacant by the secondary neuromasts  <cit> . the third and final process of pll development involves the formation of dorsoventral columns or “stitches” of neuromasts that arise from a previously established neuromast by a process akin to budding  <cit> .

it has been shown that scs associated with the plln have a key role during the entire developmental process of lateral line formation  <cit> . these glial cells have the capacity to inhibit the proliferation of incs at short range and thus prevent early formation or ectopic development of intercalary neuromasts  <cit> . preventing sc development in the lateral line either genetically  or physically  produces an early activation of the incs and therefore precocious intercalary neuromast formation  <cit> . however, the signaling pathway involved in this process is still largely unknown  <cit> .

over the last decade, the pll has become an extensively used model for regeneration and tissue homeostasis studies . several groups have shown that exposure of zebrafish larvae to micromolar concentrations of heavy metals like mercury  <cit>  and copper  or to neomycin  <cit>  kill lateral line hair cells, and that these cells reappear robustly  <dig> to  <dig> hours post injury   <cit> . not all types of damage are followed by the same outcome, however. moderate chemical or physical injury to the fish is followed by a rapid loss of only the hair cells, without eliminating other neuromast cells, and is followed by rapid regeneration of the hair cells  <cit> . in contrast, when zebrafish larvae are exposed to high concentrations of copper , the neuromasts are entirely destroyed and no regeneration occurs  <cit> . this result and others have revealed the presence of progenitor cells in neuromasts that can provide an inexhaustible supply of new hair cells  <cit> . adult zebrafish show the same robust regeneration of hair cells as larvae after similar treatment. there is additional evidence supporting the existence of a multipotent progenitor that can give rise not only to hair cells, but to all of the cell types of a neuromast. for instance, if the adult tail fin is cut, the remaining lateral line cells are able to proliferate and invade the regenerated tail, forming new neuromasts  <cit> . these observations, however, leave open the question regarding the cellular mechanisms involved in the restoration of an entire neuromast after the removal of all cells and how coordination of cellular behaviors favors a regenerative response.

here, we address this question by using electroablation  <cit>  to eliminate all of the cells of a single neuromast and follow the behavior of remaining lateral line cells. by combining genetic labeling with cell lineage experiments, we show that incs are dormant multipotent progenitor cells distinct from precursor cells that reside within the neuromasts. after neuromast damage, the incs located adjacent to the injury site have the ability to migrate into the gap, proliferate, and differentiate in order to form a new and complete sensory organ. we also show that the regenerated organs are chimeric structures derived from at least two interneuromastic progenitor cells. importantly, we find that regeneration in this context is highly dependent on an inhibitory factor produced by scs, most likely the same factor that acts during development to limit the production of sensory organs to specific locations along the body.

RESULTS
single neuromast electroablation locally ablates all components of the pll system
our aim was to understand the cellular mechanisms involved in the activation and differentiation of sensory organ precursor cells after complete neuromast ablation. to this end, we have taken advantage of a simple methodology recently developed in our laboratory, electroablation  <cit> . this technique allowed us to induce a localized tissue injury by applying an electrical pulse directly to the neuromasts, which are superficially located, to completely remove them.

we decided to ablate the third neuromast  of the pll in larvae  <dig> days post fertilization  because, at this stage, the primary pll is completely laid down and innervated  <cit> . also, the region where l <dig> is located is easily recognizable and no intercalary neuromasts appear normally in its vicinity at the stages examined  <cit> , avoiding potential misinterpretation of the results or interference by normal developmental processes in our observations. furthermore, the secondary primordium  does not travel as far caudally as l <dig> and does not generate secondary neuromasts near it.

in order to ablate the l <dig> neuromast, we applied two  <dig> μa pulses for  <dig> s each directly over the neuromast in tg transgenic larvae; in this line, pll neuromasts and incs express membrane-tagged red fluorescent protein   <cit> . as shown in fig. 1a, intact trunk neuromasts  have a rosette-like structure and are interconnected by incs . figure 1b shows the trunk of the same larva  <dig> hpi. as was previously reported  <cit> , our electroablation protocol creates a gap of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm between remaining incs at the position where l <dig> was located, with no remaining primordium-derived cells in the gap . in every experiment, we confirmed that this was the case before proceeding. adjacent neuromasts l <dig> and l <dig>  as well as most of the surrounding incs, remained intact. after  <dig> hpi, surviving lateral line cells migrated and converged midway to seal the gap . after  <dig> hpi, a new l <dig> regenerated at the same position as the original l <dig> in  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of cases . thus, electroablation can be used to inflict localized—yet complete—damage to a single neuromast and to study its regeneration.fig.  <dig> electroablation as a method for localized tissue injury in the posterior lateral line  of zebrafish larvae. a trunk of a tg larva showing red-labeled pll cells, including the second, third, and fourth neuromasts of the pll  connected by interneuromastic cells . the image was captured  <dig> hour before injury . b the trunk of the same larva  <dig> hours post injury . the asterisk shows the damaged zone, where the l <dig> neuromast was located. c–e higher magnifications of the injured area showing the process of neuromast regeneration. c at  <dig> hpi, we observed the gap generated between incs  flanking the injury zone . d at  <dig> hpi, incs located on both sides of the gap reconnected. e at  <dig> hpi, the l <dig> neuromast had regenerated . at this stage, the secondary primordium  deposited a secondary neuromast . f–h double transgenic tg larvae, where the afferent lateral line neurons are labeled in green and neuromasts are labeled in red. f this image shows the l <dig> region  <dig> hbi. g electroablation of l <dig> interrupts the lateral line nerve. h the nerve regenerates after  <dig> hpi. i–k double transgenic tg larvae, showing the schwann cells labeled in green  and neuromasts and incs labeled in red. as occurs with the incs, schwann cells reconnected after  <dig> hpi . scale bar:  <dig> μm



to further characterize the impact of electroablation on the underlying lateral line components, such as the plln, we repeated the same experiment in double transgenic tg larvae that express cytoplasmic green fluorescent protein  in the axons of the lateral line afferent neurons and mcherry in all cells derived from primi . ablation of the l <dig> neuromast produced a complete interruption of the plln . between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, the distal nerve degenerated  as previously described  <cit> . as a consequence of distal nerve degeneration, caudal neuromasts  were temporarily deprived of afferent innervations, whereas the neuromasts located rostral to the damaged site  remained innervated. after  <dig> hpi, the axons began to regenerate . as a consequence of the sprouting behavior of the regenerating nerve, a few afferent axons defasciculated and their growth became arrested at the gap left by electroablation . most axons, however, grew along the myoseptum , reaching the tip of the tail and reinnervating neuromasts caudal to l <dig> . nerve regeneration ended after  <dig> hpi, and incs had sealed the breach created by ablation of the l <dig> neuromast.

at  <dig> dpf, the plln is lined by scs that will form the myelin sheath  <cit> . we presumed that the loss of the neuromast and nerve caused by electroablation would be accompanied by a local loss of scs in the damaged zone. previous work by ourselves and others has shown that scs undergo significant changes  when the nerve they are interacting with disappears . we examined the fate of scs in our conditions by using double transgenic tg larvae that express gfp in the scs and rfp in the lateral line components . as we observed with the plln, scs located under the l <dig> neuromast were completely eliminated, generating a temporary gap that was filled after  <dig> hpi . thus, glial cells and incs sealed the injury zone at approximately the same time. however, the differentiation process of scs was reversed after temporary denervation, as was previously reported in several animal models including zebrafish  <cit> . whereas control  <dig> dpf zebrafish larvae started to express myelin basic protein , which is a differentiation marker of myelinating cells  <cit>  , in injured larvae we observed a fragmentation and then loss of mbp expression caudal to l <dig> . by  <dig> hpi, there was a complete absence of the mbp marker from the injury point to the caudal fin . the loss of mbp expression, but not of the foxd3:gfp signal, after  <dig> hpi suggests changes in the differentiation state of scs rather than death of these cells. after  <dig> hpi, we observed a partial recovery of mbp expression in the caudal zone, as was previously reported  <cit> , suggesting that the myelination process had restarted after nerve regeneration.

thus, we have shown that the continuity of the plln, scs, and incs along the pll is interrupted by electroablation at the position of neuromast l <dig>  further, we show that all three components  reestablish continuity of the pll after a few days, indicating a coordinated regeneration process. we then sought to examine the behavior of these cells and determine how they contribute to the regeneration of l <dig> after its ablation.

identification of the cells that contribute to a regenerated neuromast
in both axolotl and zebrafish, remaining neuromasts contribute to the regeneration of the lateral line after tail fin amputation  <cit> . to evaluate if this mechanism could account for neuromast regeneration in our model, we looked for changes in the number of cells in neighboring neuromasts after damage to l <dig>  to that end, we counted the hair cells in the l <dig> and l <dig> neuromasts by in vivo observation of tg l <dig> electroablated larvae  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi. we also fixed ablated and control larvae at several time points after injury  and carried out immunohistochemistry to identify and quantify additional cell types in the l <dig> and l <dig> neuromasts . total cell numbers were quantified by to-pro- <dig>  while et20:gfp transgenic larvae in combination with sox <dig> immunolabeling were used to recognize mantle cells  and the progenitor cell population   <cit> . we could not detect any significant differences in the cell composition of the l <dig> and l <dig> neuromasts when compared to the control and injured animals. we therefore concluded that neighboring neuromasts were not affected by l <dig> damage and that progenitor cells residing in neighboring neuromasts likely do not contribute to l <dig> regeneration.

it has been reported that incs have the ability to form intercalary neuromasts during late larval development in zebrafish  <cit> . here, these cells respond shortly after damage by sealing the gap left by a localized injury. to determine if the incs are in fact responsible for regeneration of the l <dig> neuromast, we electroablated l <dig> in a double transgenic line that labels incs with gfp and all lateral line cells with an rfp tag: tg. time-lapse imaging of the damaged site after ablation revealed movement of gfp+ cells on both sides of the gap that resulted in their reconnection . in no instance did we observe gfp− cells migrating into the injury zone . this suggests that cells with inc identity are the only cells that populate the injury site after electroablation.

we also fixed control and injured larvae at different times points after electroablation  with the aim of describing the temporal appearance of the different cell types of the neuromast until the end of the regeneration process. we used the transgenic lines tg for labeling incs and mantle cells, tg for labeling hair cells, and an anti-sox <dig> antibody for detecting progenitor cells  <cit> . we first confirmed that sox <dig> protein is in fact expressed in neuromast progenitor cells and not in incs. this was indeed the case at all ages analyzed , shown by the fact that incs and mantle cells were labeled with gfp in tg transgenic fish whereas only neuromast progenitors were immunostained with anti-sox <dig> antibody in the same animals . as shown in fig.  <dig>  at  <dig> hpi the electroablation gap remained devoid of any cells  but by  <dig> hpi, incs  from both sides of the gap had connected. at this stage, all the fish examined had a newly established line of incs  and some  also displayed an accumulation of gfp+ cells . in the cases where incs accumulated, some cells began to express the sox <dig> progenitor marker . at this time point , none of these protoneuromasts had developed hair cells . however, by  <dig> hpi,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  of injured larvae exhibited regeneration of the organ ; this percentage doubled after  <dig> hpi to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % .fig.  <dig> neuromast regeneration depends on interneuromastic cell accumulation. the l <dig> neuromasts of  <dig> days post fertilization tg larvae were electroablated or left uninjured as controls, and fixed at different time points after damage . a–c detection of et20:gfp-labeled cells after electroablation. d quantification of gfp-labeled cells at the l <dig> position . initially, in electroablated fish, all accumulating cells expressed gfp but the percentage of gfp versus total cells diminished significantly between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi . at all stages after injury, l <dig> neuromasts of electroablated larvae had a much higher proportion of et20:gfp cells in comparison with control larvae . e–h immunodetection and quantification of sox2-expressing cells . at  <dig> hpi, few, if any, sox2-expressing cells were seen in the injury zone but, after  <dig> hpi, the number of sox2-expressing cells was approximately the same as in controls   . note the loss of sox <dig> expression in the most centrally located cells at  <dig> hpi . i images extracted from a time-lapse sequence of a double tg electroablated larva. the sequence reveals the progressive appearance of gfp expression in centrally located hair cells. j in vivo quantification of the number of hair cells in control and injured larvae that regenerated their neuromasts at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi ; ## and β indicate statistical differences within the same group, control or injured, comparing neighboring values , while asterisks reflect statistical difference between control and injured at the same time points . note that the et20:gfp and sox <dig> expression data corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> hpi , come from a mix of larvae committed and not committed to regenerate. this is because the samples had to be fixed at stages in which we could not distinguish between the outcomes. scale bar a–g, i:  <dig> μm. further details on replicates are provided in “quantifications and statistical analysis” in the “methods” section



in regenerating neuromasts, at  <dig> hpi, et20:gfp+ cells  formed the characteristic ring of mantle cells  while a group of centrally distributed cells lost the expression of et <dig> and expressed only sox <dig> . this was reflected by the recorded decrease in the number of et20+ cells between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi . hair cells arose from the central-apical region of the new neuromast, first evident by the loss of et20:gfp/sox <dig> expression and the appearance of the mature hair cell markers . after the emergence of hair cells in the regenerating neuromast, we performed time-lapse imaging in a tg larva . we quantified hair cell number by in vivo observation of injured larvae during the  <dig> days following electroablation . the number of hair cells increases over time, although there was still a significant difference with respect to controls at at  <dig> hpi . these experiments showed that all of the cell types that compose the mature neuromast develop after the accumulation and posterior differentiation of incs. however, the lack of appropriate and specific markers to efficiently differentiate accumulating incs from progenitor or mantle cells prevented us from assigning a direct progenitor role for these cells or determining whether they must first undergo a transition through an intermediate fate.

as described above, we consistently found a proportion of electroablated larvae in which the inc stripe reconnected but that never achieved neuromast regeneration . in tg transgenic larvae that did not regenerate the l <dig> neuromast, incs continued to express gfp but not the sox <dig> protein . thus, achieving inc accumulation and expression of sox <dig> can be considered a robust predictor of regenerative success in this context.

two incs are sufficient to form a new neuromast after electroablation
to elucidate whether incs are multipotent progenitors able to reconstitute an entire neuromast, including all of its cell types, we generated mosaic animals by transplanting cells  from a tg donor embryo that ubiquitously expresses a cytoplasmic rfp into a tg host. we screened and selected transplanted larvae  <dig> hours post fertilization  that had only one or very few red-labeled incs . in these fish, we were able to follow individual incs and analyze their behavior during the regeneration process. at  <dig> dpf, we electroablated the neuromast nearest to the implanted inc in chimeric larvae  and recorded the regeneration process until  <dig> hpi. as we have shown previously, electroablation generates local damage that is circumscribed to the neuromast without affecting the neighboring incs. at  <dig> hpi, incs accumulated at the injury site. in the example shown, a single red-labeled cell  divided into two daughter cells , indicating that this accumulation is due to both the migration of incs into the gap  and the local proliferation of these cells. from  <dig> to  <dig> hpi, these cells continued to increase in number and also began to organize into a rosette-like structure . at  <dig> hpi, the number of cells had continued to increase and the newly formed neuromast was apparent . we also observed labeled daughter cells that remained within the inc population, suggesting self-renewal of the incs . finally, in all cases analyzed , the regenerated neuromast was composed of a combination of red fluorescent-labeled and et20:gfp+-labeled cells, suggesting that the regenerated sensory organs come from at least two different incs, most likely the two incs  flanking the ablation gap. in support of this conclusion, we observed that only the most proximal incs were responsive to neuromast electroablation, given that incs located in more distal positions remained quiescent and immotile during the regeneration process .fig.  <dig> regenerated neuromasts are chimeric structures derived from two interneuromastic cells . transplanting cells from a tg blastula to a tg blastula occasionally resulted in fish with one or a few labeled incs. a transplanted larva harboring a single labeled inc near l <dig> was selected  <dig> days post fertilization and subjected to electroablation of the l <dig> neuromast . the asterisc indicates the position of the ablated neuromast. the left panels  show the behavior of the transplanted cell through time. the right panels  show et20+ cells of host larvae  and the transplanted cells . during regeneration, the single transplanted cell divided and its progeny differentiated into different cells types of the mature neuromast. at  <dig> hpi, a red-labeled cell  can be observed among the incs, suggesting that at least one daughter cell maintained the original identity of the progenitor . note that the transplantation experiment randomly generated labeled cells of diverse lineages that did not participate in neuromast regeneration . scale bar:  <dig> μm



in summary, destruction of all cells in a neuromast is followed by convergent migration of at least two incs into the injury zone. once there, they proliferate and differentiate, giving rise to all of the cell types of the mature regenerated neuromast.

we next asked whether incs located only to one side of the injury zone could be responsible not only for neuromast regeneration, but also for the entire lateral line system after more severe damage, as occurs, for example, after tail fin amputation. to examine this question, we electroablated the l3–l <dig> neuromasts of a  <dig> dpf tg larvae and mechanically removed all of the incs posterior to l <dig>  the remaining incs located near the l <dig> position migrated caudally . these cells started to proliferate and accumulated in the region where l <dig> was located. at this position, the incs reorganized into a new neuromast, as we previously described. then, more distally located incs that did not belong to the prospective neuromast continued to migrate caudally, iterating the process and reconstituting the canonical row of incs and neuromasts at the myoseptum . we never observed the formation of a primordium  during this type of lateral line regeneration. we conclude that incs are progenitor cells that have the capacity, on their own, to restore the entire lateral line system after severe damage. intriguingly, the progeny of these cells were able to correctly position the new sensory organs to maintain appropriate spacing between them.fig.  <dig> contribution of interneuromastic cells  to neuromast regeneration. a–d complete elimination of all neuromasts and incs between l <dig> and l <dig> was done  <dig> days post fertilization in tg larvae by electroablation . neuromasts were electroablated whereas incs were ablated by mechanical displacement of the microelectrode through the skin. the white arrow in a shows the direction of the movement of the microelectrode. the asterisk in a shows the position of the l <dig> neuromast before electroablation. after injury, the behavior of incs located proximal to the gap was examined at  <dig> hours post injury  ,  <dig> hpi ,  <dig> hpi , and  <dig> hpi . starting at  <dig> hpi, incs accumulated at the injury zone and organized to form a new neuromast. they also migrated, beginning at  <dig> hpi, extending caudally to create a new line of incs. e–g an ectopic neuromast can appear de novo after electroablation. e the row of incs between l <dig> and l <dig> was interrupted by electroablation at the position of the asterisk; the last remaining incs are indicated by arrowheads. f at  <dig> hpi, incs started to accumulate, reconnecting the line of cells. g at  <dig> hpi, a neuromast formed between l <dig> and l <dig> at a position where there was no preexisting neuromast . at this stage, the secondary primordium  was migrating close to l <dig> and had deposited secondary neuromast lii. <dig>  further details on replicates are provided in “quantifications and statistical analysis” in the “methods” section. scale bar:  <dig> μm



we also sought to know if the appearance of a new sensory organ was restricted to the previous location of the damaged neuromast or whether the interruption of the row of incs by the local application of current at any point could elicit neuromast reconstitution. to investigate this, we electroablated midway between the l <dig> and l <dig> neuromasts:  <dig> hpi we observed the formation of a new neuromast at the ablation point in 28 ±  <dig>  % of injured larvae, and at  <dig> hpi in  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, indistinguishable from neuromast ablations . this result shows that generating a discontinuity in the pll  is sufficient to induce the formation of a new neuromast.

scs are key regulators of the neuromast regeneration process
as we have previously shown,  <dig> % of the electroablated larvae regenerate the l <dig> neuromast after  <dig> hpi by local activation and differentiation of incs. however, we were curious why the remaining  <dig> % of the larvae failed to regenerate a neuromast even though the incs became activated and migrated to seal the gap between them . based on previous knowledge on the development of this sensory system  <cit> , we hypothesized that scs might be responsible for the control of inc behavior during neuromast regeneration.

as described above, both incs and scs seal the gap created by electroablation at approximately the same time . to evaluate whether the ability of incs to regenerate a neuromast depends on their reconnection and local activation before scs seal the gap, we decided to measure the distance between surviving cells after electroablation in tg fish; in this double transgenic line both incs and scs are labeled  <cit> . we correlated the size of the gap created between incs and between scs at  <dig> hpi with the regenerative outcome of injured larvae after  <dig> hpi. as shown in fig.  <dig>  we observed that regeneration success was independent of the size of the sc gap. however, the size of the inc gap or, rather, the inc/sc gap size ratio had a significant impact on the regenerative capacity. fish that failed to regenerate exhibited a higher ratio compared to fish that regenerated the neuromast . this suggests that scs could be interacting with incs during the early steps of the regeneration process.fig.  <dig> neuromast regeneration success is inversely correlated with the size of the interneuromastic cells  gap generated by electroablation. the l <dig> neuromast of tg larvae was electroablated. at  <dig> hours post injury , we individually injured larvae and measured the length of the gap between remaining incs  and schwann cells . at  <dig> hpi, we scored the regeneration of the l <dig> neuromast and compared the two outcomes  after measuring the average gap size in each group. as is shown in a, larvae that could not regenerate the l <dig> neuromast presented a larger gap between incs compared to those that regenerated . we did the same comparison examining the size of the sc gap and found no effect in this case . calculating the ratio between inc and sc gap size again produced a significant difference when regenerating versus non-regenerating outcomes were compared . further, there was no difference in the ratio of the inc/sc gap between larvae that regenerated at  <dig> hpi versus those that regenerated at  <dig> hpi . * p <  <dig> ; n.s. not significant. further details on replicates are provided in “quantifications and statistical analysis” in the “methods” section



to test the role of scs in the regenerative capacity of neuromasts, we took advantage of a pharmacological ablation tool that is specific for this cell type. we treated zebrafish embryos with  <dig> μm of the drug ag <dig> from  <dig> hpf until  <dig> hpf. this treatment, which blocks erbb signaling, completely inhibits sc migration along the lateral line nerve during early development  <cit>  without affecting the development of other cellular components of the system. at  <dig> dpf, after confirming that no scs were present in the myoseptum, we ablated the l <dig> neuromast. as shown in fig. 6e,  <dig> % of drug-treated larvae showed neuromast regeneration after  <dig> hpi, compared to only  <dig> % of the control-injured larvae.fig.  <dig> damage to schwann cells is required for neuromast regeneration. tg larvae  <dig> days post fertilization  were treated with  <dig> μm cuso <dig> for  <dig> h to ablate all neuromasts without affecting schwann cells. a a control  larva showing the region between l <dig> and l <dig>  the secondary primordium  is seen migrating . b three hours after copper treatment, all neuromasts of the lateral line system had been chemically ablated . c at  <dig> hours post treatment , interneuromastic cells  had filled the gaps but no neuromast regeneration occurred. at this time, electroablation was carried out at the approximate position where l <dig> was . d a new l <dig> neuromast formed only where electroablation took place at  <dig> hours post injury . neither intervention  impaired the migration of primii  and deposition of secondary neuromasts . the asterisk indicates the site of injury. e the graph shows the percentage of injured larvae that regenerated a neuromast after the different treatments: l <dig> neuromast electroablation ; electroablation of incs between the l <dig> and l <dig> neuromasts ; l <dig> neuromast electroablation in larvae treated with  <dig> μm of ag <dig> from  <dig> hpf until  <dig> hpf ; l <dig> electroablation in larvae treated with  <dig> μm of ag <dig> from  <dig> hpi until  <dig> hpi ;  <dig> μm copper treatment ; or copper treatment combined with electroablation of l <dig> . scale bar a–d:  <dig> μm. further details on replicates are provided in “quantifications and statistical analysis” in the “methods” section



next, we incubated zebrafish larvae with  <dig> μm of ag <dig> from  <dig> hours before injury  until  <dig> hpi. treatment at this time does not interfere with early sc migration  but impairs their ability to continue to differentiate into mature  cells once the drug is added to the medium  <cit> . in this case, we observed that  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  of injured larvae showed neuromast regeneration after  <dig> hpi. these results strongly suggest that the presence of differentiated scs impairs regeneration due to local inhibition of incs after damage.

in order to effectively test this hypothesis, we decided to damage lateral line neuromasts without affecting the underlying scs. to this aim, we treated  <dig> dpf tg larvae with  <dig> μm cuso <dig> for  <dig> h. this treatment leads to complete neuromast loss  <cit> , which was revealed by a discontinuity of the inc line in each of the locations where neuromasts were located . importantly, in this context, neither scs nor incs were affected . after  <dig> hpi, copper-treated larvae failed to regenerate damaged neuromasts . surprisingly, when we then electroablated these fish at a point within the reconnected inc row  <dig> hours post cuso <dig> treatment , a new neuromast appeared only where electroablation was done . the percentage of larvae that regenerated a neuromast after  <dig> hpi was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % , similar to that observed in our first electroablation experiment .

our results show that the interaction between scs and incs is key to control the balance between neuromast formation  and replacement with incs  after damage to the lateral line. the appearance of a new neuromast depends of the temporal and spatial interaction between the two cell types. finally, the results obtained from ag1478-treated larvae suggests that the interaction between the two cell types in a regeneration context is dependent on the erbb signaling pathway, as has previously been shown during development of the lateral line system  <cit> .

finally, we wished to know whether the cellular mechanisms used in the larval stage to regenerate the neuromast are maintained in adult fish, where scs  are fully mature. to solve this question, we electroablated an area of approximately  <dig> μm that usually spans two or more neuromasts in the caudal fin lateral line of a tg adult zebrafish  . we monitored the regeneration process daily during the following  <dig> dpi . we observed the appearance of a regenerated neuromast in the ablated region in  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  of the cases. as seen before in larvae where we ablated all incs and neuromasts caudal to l <dig>  adult tail fin incs migrated into the electroablation gap. however, during the time we observed the ablated animals, accumulation of cells to form a new neuromast occurred exclusively on the rostral side of the gap. incs continued to migrate caudally  but we did not observe additional neuromasts forming at more posterior positions. on the caudal side of the gap, the last remaining neuromast became gradually disorganized and disappeared  <dig> dpi . this result suggests that the mechanisms employed at larval stages for neuromast regeneration are conserved in adulthood, although the regenerative capacity of neuromasts ablated in this fashion occurs in a lower percentage of individuals.fig.  <dig> adult caudal lateral line regeneration after electroablation. a 6-month-old tg fish was electroablated in the caudal fin lateral line by applying two pulses of  <dig> s duration and  <dig> μa current intensity . images of the injury were taken beginning from 1-minute post injury  to  <dig> days post injury . the image in a was taken at  <dig> mbi to show the original position of the neuromasts. the asterisk and bracket in b show the extent of the damage. c, d the yellow arrowhead points to the rostral most interneuromastic cells located immediately proximal to the damage. the red arrowheads in each panel show the disappearance of the nearest neuromast located caudal to the injury. at  <dig> dpi, et20+ cells accumulated  and at  <dig> dpi had matured into a neuromast . the position where regenerated neuromasts appeared did not recapitulate the original distribution of neuromasts before injury. scale bar a–g:  <dig> μm



discussion
regeneration in animals provides functional recovery of damaged tissues and organs after injury or disease and, thus, provides an increased opportunity to survive. for this reason, the mechanisms implicated in tissue regeneration have been extensively studied during the last decades. regeneration requires progenitor or stem cells to restore a functional organ that usually contains many cell types. signals that activate these progenitors must be induced after injury to stimulate the stem cells to proliferate and their daughters to differentiate. however, it is equally important for stem cells to remain quiescent when there is no such need. thus, it is likely that the niche that harbors the stem cells must normally contain inhibitory signals maintaining stasis and multipotency. discovering such inhibitory mechanisms may be equally as important as searching for the factors that drive activation of stem cells in the context of regeneration.

here, we have introduced a novel organ regeneration paradigm in zebrafish, an organism in which the regenerative potential of most tissues is high throughout life. many studies have used the lateral line as a convenient model system for examining the recovery of sensory hair cells and neurons after damage. this is, therefore, an excellent model for acoustic trauma and drug toxicity-induced hearing loss, two of the major causes of permanent deafness in humans. however, physical damage to tissues can also involve the indiscriminate loss of many cell types, which requires the participation of multipotent progenitors to give rise to diverse types of descendant cells. using electroablation, we showed that we can locally damage a single neuromast eliminating not only the neuromast cells, but also additional lateral line components , the extracellular matrix, skin, and muscle cells. furthermore, as we described in a recent publication  <cit> , electroablation produces a much more significant inflammatory response in comparison to damage restricted to hair cells  <cit> . it has been reported that tissue damage induces local release of hydrogen peroxide that can act as a diffusible signal modulating the regenerative response and the recruitment of immune cells to the wound margin  <cit> . however, this phenomenon clearly does not happen after single cell ablation with, for example, a focused laser.

despite the intrinsic regenerative capacity of zebrafish larvae, we found that the outcome of this treatment differed among individual fish, as not all could replace the lost neuromast. this unexpected result led us to hypothesize that perhaps the same mechanism that limits the formation of neuromasts from progenitors during development could be operating in this context, at least in a percentage of the treated animals. by following the regeneration process in vivo, we were able to resolve this question by showing that scs are key modulators of lateral line regeneration.

scs and incs interact during neuromast regeneration
regeneration assays using the zebrafish lateral line system have been widely used but they have revealed an apparent contradiction. on the one hand, exposure to high concentrations of copper sulfate irreversibly destroys the lateral line neuromasts, precluding regeneration even though there is no effect on surrounding tissues or on incs  <cit> . on the other hand, in a tail fin section paradigm, it has been shown that lateral line cells, most likely from the inc population, are able to proliferate and invade the regenerated tail and form new neuromasts  <cit> . these results leave open questions regarding the cellular mechanisms and conditioning factors involved in the restoration of an entire neuromast after the removal of all of its cells. thus, as a first step to understand how neuromasts regenerate, it is fundamentally important to visualize how different cell types interact during the regeneration process by following their behavior in vivo.

during the initial stages of lateral line development, growth of the plln does not have any role in the deposition of neuromasts by the primi, but it is necessary for the migration of sc precursors along the lateral line  <cit> . as it grows, the plln expresses neuregulin i type iii . this protein is involved in the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of the scs by binding to erbb receptors expressed in scs  <cit> . this tripartite relationship between the plln, scs, and primi-derived cells is a hallmark of this system. it has been shown that the absence of the nerve leads to the loss of the glia in the pll  <cit>  and induces the formation of supernumerary neuromasts  <cit> . as we show here, after neuromast damage, these three elements interact during the regeneration process.

electroablation of the l <dig> neuromast eliminates all neuromast cells in the injury zone . also, the lateral line nerve is interrupted and degenerates from the injury point caudally. the degeneration of the plln rapidly induces the loss of nrg1- <dig> signaling, which interrupts sc differentiation, as seen in other models . we revealed this by showing the temporary loss of myelination  soon after electroablation in scs caudal to the lesion. despite this dedifferentiation effect in scs, we did not detect formation of intercalary or ectopic neuromasts posterior to l <dig> in electroablated fish. thus, the signal-inhibiting activation of incs is either continually produced by the dedifferentiated scs or it persists  after denervation. twenty-four hours after injury, the nerve regenerates and reinnervates the caudal neuromasts while glial cells, located at both sides of the gap, make use of regenerated axons to reconnect, and start to differentiate once again  <cit> .

reports describing amphibian lateral line regeneration after tail amputation indicate that new lateral line cells can arise from existing neuromasts; for example, mantle cells detach from the neuromast and migrate to form a new lateral line  <cit> . we examined neighboring neuromasts  after ablating l <dig> and found no evidence for changes in cell composition or the number of cells in them. this suggests that progenitor cells residing within surviving neuromasts do not contribute to the regenerative process. further, we ablated all neuromasts using a high dose of copper sulfate and were able to generate a new neuromast by electroablation ; thus, lateral line neuromasts can form in larvae in the absence of any other neuromast cells, indicating that progenitors must come from incs, the only cell population remaining in this case.

after damage to the l <dig> neuromast in larvae, incs located close to the injury zone migrated into the gap and reconnected the line of cells. we observed that this process involved a bilateral contribution of cells located on both sides of the gap. further, just two of the convergent incs were required to form the entire regenerated neuromast with all of its cell types. therefore, incs are a multipotent population of cells that are normally quiescent and can become proliferative and give rise to differentiated progeny when an injury occurs.

notably, in larvae, a functional neuromast formed at approximately the same position of the original neuromast in a matter of  <dig> days. this is different from what we observed in adults. in the adult tail fin, regeneration of an ablated section of lateral line took over  <dig> days. during this time, we noticed that the closest neuromast located caudal to the injury became disorganized and disappeared. this did not occur with rostrally located neuromasts. it is known that afferent innervation of adult neuromasts is required for their maintenance  <cit> . since we were ablating the nerve, and the regenerative process is slow compared to larval stages, it is possible that adult neuromast cells caudal to the damaged site lost the signaling required for their continued survival. in addition, electroablation of the adult tail produces a potent inflammatory response  <cit> , which could induce tissue remodeling and local destruction of cells, as occurs in larvae after copper treatment  <cit> . in addition to the disappearance of the first neuromast caudal to the injury area, we also failed to observe any contribution of caudal incs to the injury zone. further exploration of this phenomenon will be needed in order to clarify the role of innervation and/or inflammation in the regeneration of the adult lateral line.

as a consequence of the unilateral contribution of incs to pll regeneration in adult tail neuromasts, the new neuromasts reappeared in locations that were different to the original ones. this also occurred in larvae when we eliminated the entire lateral line from l <dig> posteriorwards or after electroablating between neuromasts . these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the ability of incs to form a neuromast is strictly dependent on the absence of the inhibitory signal produced by scs, and that this signal is likely stored in the extracellular matrix: in the total absence of glia, neuromasts are “free” to form in any location, as long as the incs accumulate and differentiate.

scs inhibit inc activation via the erbb signaling pathway
despite the consistency of the neuromast electroablation process in larvae, we found two distinct outcomes after  <dig> days of recovery: regeneration of the neuromast  or reconnection of the incs without the formation of a new organ . we noticed that incs and scs mobilized and filled the gap almost simultaneously, indicating that perhaps there was an almost equal chance of regeneration versus repair depending on a small advantage of one cell type versus the other when reconnecting both sides of the gap. several experiments confirmed the crucial role scs play in controlling inc fate. first, we showed that when we ablated neuromasts without affecting scs , incs migrated and reconnected to restore the stripe of cells but regeneration of the neuromasts never occurred; regeneration could be induced in this case only by electroablating . second, when we inhibited sc development by inhibiting erbb signaling, the neuromast regeneration efficiency rose to  <dig> % in electroablated larvae. we showed that erbb signaling is in fact critical for the inhibitory effect because regeneration efficiency could also be increased by inhibiting the pathway during the process .

thus, neuromast regeneration depends on the generation of a spatial niche that is free of inhibition by scs during a temporal window that is sufficient to induce inc migration and proliferation; this is likely the same process that occurs during formation of an intercalary neuromast in normal development of the lateral line in juvenile fish.

incs are multipotent progenitors
with the tools available to us, we have been able to describe the process incs follow to regenerate a functional neuromast after the preexisting one has been electroablated. incs normally express the et20:gfp marker but, as they become activated to migrate, proliferate, and accumulate at the damage site, they temporarily co-express the sox <dig> protein . some of these cells  then lose the et20:gfp marker, retaining only sox <dig> expression, thus becoming neuromast progenitor cells  <cit> . importantly, we determined that the loss of et20:gfp and retention of sox <dig> in a central subset of cells is strictly correlated with a regenerative outcome. those cells that continue to express both markers accumulate at the periphery of the forming neuromast and become mantle cells. however, in the absence of a more precise definition of lineage relationships, we do not know if all cells transition through one of these two conditions and then one subset differentiates into the other, or whether there are two independent lineages arise from incs that generate both populations . towards the end of the regeneration process, the apical centrally located cells lose the et20:gfp and sox <dig> labels and start to express brn3c, a hair cell marker indicative of differentiation. this differentiation process likely involves notch signaling, the pathway responsible for blocking proliferation and the loss of progenitor status  <cit> . using genetically mosaic animals, we were able to show that all of the cell types of a regenerated neuromast can derive from a single inc. in all cases examined, we saw that at least two incs contributed to the regenerated organ; thus, we propose that one inc from each side of the wound is sufficient to give rise to the complete neuromast.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of neuromast regeneration from interneuromastic cells . a a schematic representation of the four stages identified here during regeneration of a whole neuromast. i, after neuromast ablation, a remaining inc that has multipotent progenitor properties  becomes activated; ii, the inc divides, and daughter cells accumulate where the original neuromast was and acquire expression of sox <dig> ; iii, mantle cells  differentiate at the periphery of the cell cluster while central cells lose gfp expression , becoming neuromast progenitor cells; iv, neuromast regeneration is achieved when hair cells  differentiate. b differentiation pathway of incs during neuromast regeneration. it is unclear from our study whether inc progeny can differentiate directly into the mantle cells  or whether mcs differentiate from a proliferative inc  . the pincs accumulate and can differentiate into a neuromast progenitor cell , losing the et <dig> marker. finally, the acquisition of brn3c expression 



CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we explored the cellular mechanisms that govern neuromast regeneration and how the specialized cellular microenvironment constrains the behavior of progenitor cells responsible for regenerating an organ or tissue. we show that the mechanism involved in the normal development of the lateral line during the formation of intercalary neuromasts is also used during regeneration of neuromasts in larvae and adult zebrafish. incs are multipotent progenitors that are kept quiescent by erbb signaling in scs, but a traumatic event that disrupts this inhibition can trigger regeneration. this simple yet highly effective interrelationship between a stem cell and a regulatory cell can be useful for defining the properties of a niche that can provide the cellular substrate for repeated and permanent tissue regeneration.
