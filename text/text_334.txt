BACKGROUND
nearly all cellular nucleic acid transactions, including dna replication, repair and recombination require the activity of a single stranded dna binding protein   <cit> . ssb proteins and are found throughout nature and their functional importance is underscored by their presence in prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes including mammals  <cit> . among its multifaceted roles, upon binding to ssdna, ssb prevents the reformation of duplex dna making it possible for other enzymes such as dna polymerase to use ssdna as substrate. in addition, the binding of ssb-type proteins protects the ssdna molecules from attack by intracellular nucleases. although not possessing intrinsic enzymatic activity in and of themselves, ssb proteins are known to influence the activities of many enzymes as well as to organize the multi-protein complexes required for processes such as dna replication, recombination and dna repair  <cit> .

the function of ssb during dna replication has been extensively studied in e. coli, which serves as the prototypical model system for prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike. in e. coli, the large nucleoprotein replication initiation complex is stabilized by single stranded dna binding protein, following which dna is unwound by the dnab helicase protein. efficient dna unwinding activity of dnab protein in progression of the replication fork in e. coli is strongly dependent on the continued action of a cognate ssb  <cit> . ssb works in concert with dnab helicase, dna primase, and dna polymerase iii holoenzyme during e. coli dna replication  <cit> . phage λ dna replication requires the participation of host e. coli ssb as well  <cit> . in archaea and eukaryotes, its functional homolog, replication protein a , carries out the role of organizing and stabilizing the replisome during dna replication  <cit> .

vital to its function in dna metabolism is the structure of ssb. in the gram-negative bacteria, ssb is homotetrameric, with each monomer contributing a single ssdna-binding domain to the functional form. the eukaryotic rpa is composed of three subunits  and functions as a heterotrimer through the use of four ssdna-binding domains  <cit> .

unlike e. coli ssb, single stranded dna binding protein from bacteriophage t <dig>  the gene  <dig> protein, is a monomer. t <dig> gene  <dig> protein can form multimers at high concentration induced by high salt and high ph  <cit> . kim and richardson demonstrated that the bacteriophage t <dig> ssb, the gene  <dig>  protein, is a dimer  <cit> . the t <dig> gene  <dig>  ssb appears to bind dna as a dimer. the ssdna binding affinities of both t <dig> and t <dig> ssbs are lower than that observed with e. coli ssb. despite these differences, ssdna binding of ssb proteins using ob fold-domains  appears to be universal throughout all systems described to date  <cit> .

the e. coli ssb is highly cooperative in ssdna binding that is influenced by salt concentration  <cit> . recent studies indicate that ssb has at least two distinct modes of ssdna binding  <cit> . the binding is modulated by monovalent salts. at very low salt concentration , ssb binds ssdna using two of its four subunits in a highly cooperative manner and occludes only  <dig> nucleotides . on the other hand, at higher salt concentrations , it binds to ssdna using all four subunits and protects ~ <dig> nucleotides . it is not clear how the ssdna binding is altered between  <dig> and 200 mm nacl. higher-order forms of ssb in ssdna bound states, based on high resolution electron microscopic studies of ssb-ssdna complex, have also been reported  <cit> . chrysogelos and griffith discovered that repeated freezing-thawing of e. coli ssb leads to the formation of unique strings of tetramers  <cit> .

gram-positive bacterial protein sequences do not form a monophyletic group, but are intermixed with plasmid and phage sequences  <cit> . gene organization in these organisms can differ from that observed in gram-negative e. coli and these organisms may contain multiple paralogues  <cit> . sequence analysis indicated that gram-positive ssbs have a highly conserved nearly-identical  n-terminal ssdna binding as well as monomer-monomer interaction domains but they differ to some extent from the gram-negative ssbs. we have investigated the structure and ssdna binding of a gram-positive bacillus ssb  in order to understand its mechanism of action of ssbs in these organisms. we present here a report of a gram-positive ssb that utilizes a novel structural mechanism for protein-dna interaction using a transient tetramer formation.

RESULTS
the single-stranded dna binding protein orf of b. anthracis  was identified by blast search of the annotated sequenced genome of b. anthracis stern strain  <cit> . the orf encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda.

sequence analysis of ssbba
the amino acid sequence of the n-terminal ssdna binding and protein-protein interaction domains responsible for dimer and tetramer formation of ssbba were compared with the sequences of a gram-positive  and gram-negative  ssb proteins. multiple-alignment of these sequences, using clustalw <dig>  is shown in figure  <dig>  in general, a high degree of sequence homology among ssbs was observed only in the n-terminal two-thirds of the proteins. in the n-terminus two-third, sequence homology  of ssbba was observed with gram-positive ssbs and was estimated to be ~54%, whereas, it was ≥90% among gram-negative ssbs. amino acid residues 1– <dig> constitute the major portion of the ssb core domain and contain the ob dna binding fold. the second region of homology observed was between residues 51– <dig> . a third area of homology was also observed in the last six residues with the sequence, dddlpf, which corresponds to the acidic carboxy-terminal domain characteristic of eubacteria; this sequence is required for interaction with recombination, replication and repair machineries  <cit> . the c-terminal region lacked significant homology even among gram-negative ssbs in the region between the residues 100– <dig> among these ssbs  <cit> .

purification of ssbba
recombinant ssbba was highly soluble when expressed in e. coli. it was purified using a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation as well as conventional ion exchange chromatography. these steps resulted in homogenous ssbba . in se-hplc analysis of purified ssbba  the protein eluted as a single peak with an elution volume consistent with that of a monomer .

to test the biological activity of ssbba we measured its ability to stimulate its cognate dnab, dnabba, using a fret based dna helicase assay. it was based on the ability of ssbba to stimulate dna unwinding activity of its cognate dna helicase, dnabba . in the absence of ssbba, dna unwinding by dnabba was limited  and was greatly stimulated in the presence of ssbba . the stimulation of the dna helicase activity of dnabba in the presence of the purified ssbba was > <dig> fold which was as expected for the cognate ssb  <cit> .

mechanism of ssdna binding by ssbba
fluorescence anisotropy-based titration of a dna-fluorophore by the dna binding protein is a direct methodology for determining affinity of protein-dna complexes. following this approach, 5′-fluorescein-labeled oligo <dig> 20) was used as a fluorescence anisotropy probe for analyzing ssbba and ssdna interactions. in order to determine the binding constant for ssbba, the interaction of ssbba with 5′-flourescein labeled oligo <dig> was examined at 25°c and in buffer b containing  <dig>  nm fl- <dig>  25 mm kcl and 5 mm mg+ <dig>  fl- <dig> was titrated with ssbba until saturation in anisotropy was observed. the anisotropy values at various ssbba concentrations were used to create a binding isotherm as a semi-log plot as shown in figure  <dig>  at very low ssbba concentrations, very small anisotropy changes and a flat plateau  were observed that were attributed to fl- <dig>  upon further addition of ssbba, the anisotropy value increased with an increase in ssbba·fl- <dig> complex formation. a sigmoid binding isotherm with saturation binding at high ssbba concentration was observed with maximum anisotropy of  <dig> ± 5 ma. at higher ssb concentration , anisotropy did not change significantly . nonlinear regression analysis, using a sigmoidal dose–response equation, of the data allowed for determination of the ssbba concentration at which 50% of the ligand was in bound form ; that value corresponds to the apparent dissociation constant. the kd for ssbba·fl- <dig> complex was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  x 10−9 m. the hill coefficient was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  indicating a possible binding of one to two molecules of ssbba to fl- <dig>  which is not surprising considering the fact that ssbba does not form a stable tetramer. a simple hyperbolic fit of the anisotropy data was also carried out . the estimated kd value was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  x 10−9 m. in order to determine the correct method of analysis of binding data, we have examined the “goodness of fit” using both models. the r <dig> value for the sigmoidal dose–response model was found to be  <dig> , whereas, for the simple hyperbolic model was  <dig> . the f-test using the values of degrees-of-freedom and absolute sum of squares, gave an f-value of  <dig>  which correlated well with the r <dig> values and clearly demonstrated that the sigmoidal dose–response model as the correct model/equation for fitting anisotropy binding data for such analysis.

. ssdna binding was measured using fluorescence anisotropy of fl- <dig> oligonucleotide probe using the fluorescence of its 5′-fluorescein moiety using 480 nm excitation and 540 nm emission of fluorescein as described in materials & methods. titration was carried out with ssbba and fluorescence anisotropy of fl- <dig> was measured. as indicated, anisotropy of free fl- <dig> oligonucleotide probe was 44 ± 5 ma and that of the ssbba·fl- <dig> complex was 182 ± 6 ma. anisotropy values were plotted against log of ssbba concentration and the plots were analyzed by nonlinear regression using prism  <dig> . the error bars indicate standard deviation.  a simple plot of the data fitted to single association hyperbolic function.

thermodynamics of ssdna binding
in order to understand the thermodynamics of ssbba·ssdna binding interactions, we have analyzed ssbba binding to ssdna at different temperatures over a range of 20–37°c. the temperature-dependent binding isotherms for ssbba and fl- <dig> are presented in figure 5a. higher anisotropy values observed at  <dig> or 25°c were due to glycerol used in this assay. as the temperature increased, an overall decrease in anisotropy value was observed for both the free and bound oligonucleotides. this overall decrease in anisotropy value is attributed to the decrease in viscosity of the solution with increasing temperature which was somewhat attenuated by adding glycerol. with a decrease in temperature, the viscosity as well as the anisotropy values appeared to increase  <cit> . analysis of the binding curve data for kd showed the dissociation constants increased steadily from 20°c to 37°c. we did not observe any significant change in the hill coefficient with temperature. this increase in kd could likely be due to the dissociation of the protein·dna complex at higher temperatures. the dnaaba·dna complex was most stable at 20–25°c.
ba
·ssdna complex formation. temperature dependence of ssdna binding by ssbba was measured at temperatures as indicated.  binding isotherms for ssbba binding to ssdna at seven temperatures: 20°c, 25°c, 32°c and 37°c are shown. the concentration of the oligonucleotide was  <dig>  nm and 25 mm nacl was added.  van’t hoff plot was made using the analysis of the kd values obtained from the nonlinear regression of plot in 5a.

the dissociation constants obtained at varying temperatures were used to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of dna binding. we have plotted the dissociation constants using the van’t hoff equation, lnkd = −Δh°/rt, where Δh° is the enthalpy change and t and r are the temperature and gas constant respectively, with the dissociation constants derived from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 37°c . the plot is linear for temperatures 20°c to 37°c and it diverges from linearity below 20°c. the slope of the van’t hoff plot was used to derive the change in enthalpy  at 25°c . the change in entropy  was calculated to be  <dig>  j mol−1 k− <dig>  thus, it appears that the formation of the ssbba·ssdna complex has a strong entropic or hydrophobic component to the overall protein-dna interaction.

in addition to hydrophobic interaction between ssbba and ssdna, we analyzed the contribution of ionic interactions, if any, in the complex formation. fluorescence anisotropy was used determine the kd of formation of ssbba·ssdna complex as a function of nacl concentration. the binding isotherm at different salt concentrations was generated using ssbba titration of ssdna at 25°c . each titration curve fits according to a single site binding isotherm. the data shows that highest affinity binding occurs at 0–25 mm nacl. the dissociation constant increased steadily from 0–250 mm nacl. the most striking change was in the values of the hill coefficient. at 0 mm nacl, it was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and steadily decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at 150 mm nacl and beyond. it could indicate that at 0 mm nacl, ssbba was forming a predominantly dimeric structure which transformed into monomeric at higher nacl concentration. however, at very low ionic strength, non-specific protein-protein interactions could not be ruled out. a thermodynamic linkage plot for ssdna binding as a function of nacl  was generated from the kd values obtained from figure 6a. the presence of a negative slope was indicative of a net ion release  <cit> . the data were analyzed using the following equation to determine the number of ions released upon binding:

  Δnions=1n1/kd/1nnacl

·ssdna complex formation. ionic strength dependence of ssdna binding by ssbba was measured at nacl concentration as indicated.  binding isotherms for ssbba binding to ssdna at six nacl concentrations:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 200 mm.  thermodynamic linkage plot for ssbba binding to ssdna as a function of nacl concentration. the net average number of ions released upon complex formation was derived from the slope of the plot.

the analysis suggests that upon ssbba·ssdna complex formation, only one ion was released from the protein-dna interface. these results appeared to indicate a small but significant contribution of ionic interaction in the ssdna binding.

structural analysis of ssbba by homology modeling
the ssbba sequence was further analyzed for secondary structure using rosetta software . rosetta analysis indicated that there are at least five significant β strand structures and a single α-helix in the n-terminal half of the molecule . the structure between the residues 101– <dig> appeared to be a random coil. these secondary structures are consistent with known features of ssbec monomer, as determined earlier by x-ray crystallography  <cit> .

alignment of ssbba sequence with sequences of other prokaryotic ssbs did not provide any clue to the basis of its ssdna binding properties . therefore, the three-dimensional structure of ssbec derived from x-ray crystallography  <cit>  was explored. the significant sequence homology of ssbba with e. coli ssb allowed us to develop a putative three dimensional model of ssbba using homology based modeling. the initial modeling was done using the swiss-model server  <cit> . further refinement of the model by energy minimization was carried out using sybyl  <dig>   molecular modeling software using the ssb crystal structure, pdb id: 1qvc, as the structure template  <cit> . the structures for e. coli ssbec, 1qvc and ssbba were visualized using pymol . structures of both ssbs are presented in pymol in figure  <dig> 
ba
.  model of the ssbec derived from the crystal structure of a chymotrypsin truncated ssbec monomer lacking 42 c-terminal residues .  model of the ssbba derived from the crystal structure ssbec monomer . both of these structures were generated using pymol. in ssbec, trp <dig>  trp <dig>  and phe <dig> are important in the ssdna binding, which are replaced by phe <dig>  tyr <dig>  and trp <dig> respectively in ssbba. most notably, his <dig> residue of ssbec, required for monomer-monomer interaction is replaced by ile <dig> in ssbba <cit> .

ssb proteins are known to bind ssdna through their oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold  as described by murzin  <cit> . the ob fold is characterized by a β-barrel consisting of five β-strands capped by an α-helix. despite sequence differences between ssbba and ssbec, the ob fold observed in ssbec remained intact in ssbba including the β-turn regions, particularly l <dig> between β sheets  <dig> and  <dig> . it has been shown that the β sheet  <dig> of ssbec with the sequence vnkvilv is in the monomer-interface of the ssbec dimer  <cit> . in ssbba, this β sheet remains partially intact  with the loss of the val <dig> residue. however, the his <dig> of one monomer in ssbec forms a hydrogen bond with asn <dig> and the carbonyl oxygen of leu <dig> of another monomer, which is essential for a stable dimer/tetramer formation. although asn <dig>  and leu <dig>  remained conserved, one of the most important residues, his <dig> in ssbec was altered to ile  in ssbba . it should be noted that in the temperature-sensitive e. coli mutant, ssb- <dig>  his <dig> was mutated to tyr <dig> leading to the ts-phenotype. e. coli ssb- <dig> ts-mutant does not form a stable tetramer at non-permissive temperature  <cit> . thus, the lack of this his residue in ssbba will likely hinder a stable dimer formation.

the ssbec tetramer is formed by the interaction of two dimers  <cit> . the dimer-dimer interface involves two six-stranded surfaces, each comprised of β <dig>  β <dig>  and β <dig> from two monomers. the structure of ssbba, as shown in figure  <dig>  could form such a tetramer interface, had it not been for the difficulty associated with the dimer formation. it has been shown with a number of ssb crystal structures that a network of hydrogen bonds among the side chains in this six-stranded interface is necessary for a stable tetramer formation. the residues that were shown to be important in ssbec for this network of hydrogen bond formation are lys <dig>  tyr <dig>  gln <dig>  glu <dig>  and gln <dig>  sequence comparison  between ssbec and ssbba indicated that all of these residues in ssbba underwent changes and are as follows: lys8→arg <dig>  tyr79→gly <dig>  gln77→leu <dig>  gln83→arg <dig>  and gln111→phe <dig>  although all of the changes may not be significant, three of these five changes are significant in terms of hydrogen bond formation. therefore, these amino acid changes in ssbba are likely to impede tetramer formation further. taken together, inhibition of both monomer-monomer interaction leading to dimer formation as well as dimer-dimer interaction leading to tetramer formation, the amino acid sequence of ssbba does not support formation of stable dimer or tetramer.

analysis of the structure of ssdna binding pocket in ssbba
single-stranded dna binding by prokaryotic ssbs has been shown by several groups to be carried out exclusively by tetrameric forms of ssbs containing four ob folds or dimeric forms with each monomer containing two ob folds  <cit> . thus, the presence of four ob folds in ssbs appears essential for high affinity ssdna binding. our studies indicated that ssbba bound ssdna with very high affinity  even though it did not appear to form a stable tetramer in the absence of dna at the concentration range examined .

the amino acid residues in ssbba that are homologous to the residues in other ssbs, particularly ssbec, that are known from crystallographic studies to bind to ssdna were analyzed. several hydrophobic residues, trp <dig>  trp <dig>  and phe <dig>  in ssbec have been identified as involved in ssdna binding through base stacking interactions  <cit> . in helicobacter pylori ssb , phe <dig>  phe <dig>  phe <dig>  and trp <dig> are involved in base stacking interactions with ssdna  <cit> . these hydrophobic residues  with changes remained conserved in ssbba . as shown in figure  <dig>  these aromatic side chains are exposed in the dna binding groove of the ob fold so that ssdna bases could have stacking interactions. in addition, ssdna binding to ssb requires a large number of positively charged residues for the formation of ionic bridges with the phosphodiester backbone of ssdna. a large number of arg and lys residues were observed in and around the groove as shown in figure  <dig>  among these, arg <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig> appeared to be in close proximity of the dna binding groove and form ionic bridges with the phosphodiester backbone. consequently, the high affinity ssdna binding observed with ssbba could be due to basic as well as aromatic residues in its dna binding groove.

subunit structure of ssbba in the ssbba·ssdna complex
our studies demonstrated that ssbba was capable of high-affinity binding of ssdna. was it possible that the protein could form higher order structures, possibly tetramers, upon binding long ssdna templates? tetrameric e. coli ssb binds ssdna in two distinguishable forms; ssb <dig> and ssb <dig> <cit> . the ssb <dig> form binds approximately  <dig> nt and the ssb <dig> form binds approximately  <dig> nt on a  <dig> template. in the ssb <dig> form, only two subunits of the tetramer make contacts with the dna, whereas, in ssb <dig> form all four subunits of the tetramer make contacts with the dna. these two forms can be distinguished by fluorescence resonance energy transfer  using a long ssdna labeled in each end with cy <dig> and cy <dig> fluorophores  <cit> . the ssb <dig> form produces high fret and the ssb <dig> form produces attenuated fret. this approach was utilized using a seventy nucleotide,  <dig>  oligonucleotide labeled with a 3′ cy <dig> fluorophore and a 5′ cy <dig> fluorophore 70-cy3) to test our hypothesis that ssbba forms higher order structures upon dna binding. with this ssdna substrate, we anticipated that ssbba in ssb35-mode would produce attenuated fret and ssb65-mode would produce high fret. binding of ssbec to cy5-70-cy <dig> oligonucleotide was first analyzed to test the validity of our assay. the results are presented in figure  <dig>  fret was measured using 515 nm excitation wavelength and 665 nm emission wavelength. the emission intensity was corrected for cy <dig> contribution to 665 nm emission. fret was defined by /f <dig> where f <dig> and f are the corrected 665 nm emission intensities of the  <dig> nm 5′-cy570cy3-3′ oligonucleotide in the absence and presence of ssb respectively. in the titration with ssbec, sharp increase in fret with initial titration with ssbec reaching a peak at  <dig>  μm concentration was seen. upon further titration with ssbec, the fret decreased substantially and reached a plateau at concentrations higher than  <dig>  μm. these results with ssbec are comparable to that observed by roy et al.  <cit> . however, our experiments required a somewhat higher concentration of ssbec than reported by roy et al.  <cit> , which could be due to different buffer systems and ssdna concentration. thus, at  <dig>  μm ssbec, the high fret 4- <dig> complex was observed and at or above  <dig>  μm ssbec, intermediate fret 8- <dig> complex was seen.

next, ssbba binding to cy570cy <dig> oligonucleotide was analyzed. the cy570cy <dig> oligonucleotide was titrated with ssbba as described above for ssbec. similar to ssbec, fret increased linearly with increasing concentration of ssbba, and reached a plateau at  <dig>  μm surprisingly, only a high fret form of - <dig> complex was observed. however, initial slope of the plot is very different from that observed with ssbec which is a stable tetramer. therefore, it appeared that the high fret form of the complex was formed but required higher concentration of ssbba. the high fret form of - <dig> complex is a tetrameric complex in which all four monomers bind ssdna. the high fret form of - <dig> complex should have the same oligomeric structure as the high fret form of - <dig> complex. as ssbba lacked stable tetramer formation, it required higher  ssb concentration to form the high fret complex. the reason is that this complex is not formed by a single binding event as is the case with ssbec complex. it involves four binding and one structural rearrangement steps. as individual monomers are binding, there are four separate binding constants  involved in the 4- <dig> complex formation. it will be erroneous to assume that they are all  <dig> nm. certainly k <dig> is  <dig> nm as observed in figure  <dig>  other binding constants  are likely to be higher than  <dig> nm due to steric hindrance which is particularly important for k <dig> involving the binding of the fourth monomer. the  <dig> is small and can accommodate only four ssbba resulting in progressive lack of sufficient open dna for second, third and fourth ssbba monomers to bind. therefore, it is very likely that k <dig> and k <dig> are higher and k <dig> is substantially higher than  <dig> nm which explains a higher ssbba concentration to achieve a high fret complex. based on this reasoning of the 4- <dig> complex formation, as described above, our data actually supports the model in figure  <dig>  lack of observation of an intermediate fret form of the - <dig> complex in this study indicated that a 8- <dig> complex probably did not form in appreciable amount even with high proportional levels of ssbba. based on these reasonings of the 4- <dig> complex formation, as described above, our data led to the proposal of the model presented in figure  <dig> for the 8- <dig> complex.

discussion
ssb protein is required for a variety of processes such as dna replication, recombination and dna repair despite its lack of any enzymatic activity  <cit> . among its multifaceted cellular activities, a common feature of all of these processes is to bind ssdna with high affinity and protect it from reannealing and/or degradation. of emerging importance is ssb’s role in protein-protein interaction during various dna transactions. most studies involving ssb proteins demonstrated that ssdna wraps around a tetrameric form of ssb.

ssbba does not form a stable tetramer
e. coli ssbec is a stable tetramer with high solubility and tremendous thermal stability  <cit> . the majority of prokaryotic cellular ssbs are homotetramers, where each monomer harbors an ob fold. however there are exceptions. ssbdr from deinococcus radiodurans is a homodimer, where each monomer is quite large and contains two ob folds  <cit> . each ob fold is capable of binding ssdna independently. in both cases, a stable ssb protein complex with four ob folds is required for ssdna binding. ssbba was found to be not tetrameric at or above ambient temperature by size exclusion hplc . this physicochemical property of ssbba is closely comparable to the t <dig> bacteriophage ssb, which is monomeric.

molecular basis of ssbba structure
sequence alignment and three dimensional structure of ssbba, generated by homology-based modeling were utilized to probe the molecular basis of ssdna binding . sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction  clearly indicated the presence of an ob fold in ssbba, which is a characteristic of ssbs and required for high affinity ssdna binding .

both sequence alignment and homology modeling  indicated lack of several residues that are important for monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer interactions leading to the formation of a stable tetramer in ssbec. his <dig>  of β sheet  <dig>  in ssbec plays an important role by forming a hydrogen bond with asn <dig> in β sheet  <dig>  the carbonyl group in leu <dig> and thr <dig> at the base of loop l <dig>  notably, in e. coli temperature-sensitive mutant, ssb- <dig>  his <dig> is mutated to tyr <dig>  <cit> . this mutant does not form a stable tetramer with respect to monomers at non-permissive temperatures  <cit> . thus, a lack of the corresponding his residue  in ssbba may be one of the important contributors to its structure. moreover, in b. anthracis the sequence glu <dig>  trp <dig> his <dig> in the e. coli β sheet  <dig> is altered to asp <dig> phe <dig> ile <dig> . this change did not alter the β sheet structure but may have altered the contributions of these residues in the monomer-monomer interaction in the stable dimer and tetramer formation. it appears that although β sheet  <dig> remained conserved in ssbba, this region lacks the valine residue which may have attenuated the interaction of the β sheet  <dig> with β sheet 1′ in the monomer-monomer interface of the dimer. the shortening of the n-terminus in ssbba may also have deleterious effect in the interactions involving h-bonds in this region and can contribute to the lack of tetramer formation. taken together, the amino acid residue substitutions in ssbba, as described above, are likely contributed to the disruption of monomer-monomer interaction leading to dimer formation.

the dimer-dimer interface in the ssbec tetramer is primarily a six-stranded β sheet-mediated. residues that are important in ssbec for the network of hydrogen bond formation at the dimer-dimer interface are lys <dig>  tyr <dig>  gln <dig>  glu <dig>  and gln <dig>  <cit> . sequence comparison  between ssbec and ssbba indicated that all of these residues in ssbba underwent alteration and are as follows: lys8→arg <dig>  tyr79→gly <dig>  gln77→leu <dig>  gln83→arg <dig>  and gln111→phe <dig>  some of these changes are chemically significant leading to possible disruption of the network of hydrogen bond formation that is required for a stable tetramer formation. in addition, gln <dig> and gln <dig> are located in the dimer-dimer interface and have been implicated in the tetramer formation. as described earlier, gln <dig> is altered to phe <dig> in ssbba. an equally significant change is observed with gln <dig> which is changed to leu <dig> in ssbba. taken together, these changes in amino acid sequence may disrupt both monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer interactions leading to a monomeric ssbba at a physiological temperature.

energetics of ssbba·ssdna binding
protein-dna recognition and binding involve complex interactions. earlier, we have used fluorescence anisotropy analysis of dna binding by e. coli dna primase and determined the thermodynamic parameters of protein-dna interaction . we have used a similar analysis to probe the ssdna binding by ssbba. in addition, we have analyzed contribution of electrostatic and ionic interactions in the binding by analyzing the dependence of binding on the ionic strength of the environment. together, these two analyses provided a detailed picture of the forces in ssbba·ssdna binding.

the kd values were determined at different temperatures  . our data showed that although ssbba was able to bind dna at a wide range of temperatures, it bound with the highest affinity at 20–25°c. the free energy change for ssb·ssdna association was −23 kj mol− <dig> at 25°c. using the two equations: Δg° = −rt lnkd and Δg° = Δh°−tΔs° and the slope of the plot, we determined that Δs° was ~188 j mol−1 k− <dig> in this temperature range.

we determined the kd value of ssbba binding to ssdna at different salt concentrations  . the binding is progressively weakened with an increase in ionic strength. the kd values were then analyzed using a linkage plot to determined ionic interactions in the binding. the negative slope of the plot in figure 5b indicated a release of ions from. our analysis determined the release of one na+ and one cl- ion during the binding process. in addition, our results also pointed out that ssbba likely formed a tetrameric species at 0 mm nacl and became monomeric at higher nacl concentration. it is perhaps possible that the tetramer formation could be dependent on the ionic strength.

thus our results suggest that ionic interaction or salt bridge formation between the protein and the dna made specific contribution to the overall free energy change. in order to determine the contribution we first extrapolated kd value of the complex at infinite salt concentration  by nonlinear regression of kd versus log plot . the value of Δg°ionic was −8 kj mol− <dig> 

mechanisms of ssdna binding by ssbba
despite differences between its gram-negative counterpart, ssbba bound to ssdna with high affinity . the ssdna binding affinity  for a ssbba monomer binding to a small oligonucleotide was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  x 10−9 m at 25°c. even though many changes in amino acid sequence of ssbba directly relate to ssdna binding, such as trp55→phe <dig>  trp90→tyr <dig>  phe61→trp <dig>  the changes are not drastic enough to alter ssdna binding . three dimensional structure as well as electrostatic surface potential in figure  <dig> indicates that ssdna binding remained unperturbed. a temperature-sensitive mutant of e. coli ssb, ssb- <dig>  is unable to form a stable tetramer at a non-permissive temperature  <cit> . this mutant is also defective in supporting dna replication at non-permissive temperature. thus, it appears a ssb tetramer formation is a prerequisite for dna replication. consequently, we sought to explore whether ssdna template could influence the ability of ssbba to form tetramers upon dna binding. a likely possibility is that ssbba is capable of forming a normal tetrameric structure containing four ob-folds, as seen in other ssbs, upon sufficiently long ssdna. this possibility was examined using a recently developed fret assay for ssb·ssdna interaction  <cit> .

previous studies with ssbec have shown that its ssb <dig> and ssb <dig> binding modes can be distinguished by a fret assay  <cit> . both of these ssdna binding modes require a tetrameric  structure of bound ssb. a similar fret assay was used to probe the structure of ssbba in ssdna bound state. as the ssdna binding constant of ssbba is very high, the possibility that it may form a tetramer only in the ssdna bound state was investigated. as shown in figure 9a, ssbec formed both ssb <dig> and ssb <dig> structures with the 5′-cy570cy3-3′ oligonucleotide as evidenced by fret analysis. as described earlier, ssb <dig> represented the intermediate-fret complex and ssb <dig> represented the high-fret ssb-ssdna complex. at a low ssb to dt <dig> ratio, it formed the high fret complex and at a high ssb to dt <dig> ratio, it formed the intermediate fret complex. in the fret analysis, ssbba formed only a high-fret complex but not the intermediate-fret complex . in addition, the slope of the plot with ssbba is different from that of ssbec. as ssbec is a stable tetramer, the high fret complex formed rapidly with increasing ssb concentration and it formed much slowly with ssbba because of the lack of a stable tetramer formation. our results appeared to indicate  a tetrameric structure of ssbba in the ssbba-ssdna complex, and  the ssbba-ssdna complex was formed only in the ssb <dig> mode. due to high affinity of ssdna binding, perhaps four monomers can bind the oligo <dig> prior to the tetramer formation. once this multi-ssbba complex is formed, the bound ssbba monomers undergo conformational transition and form tetrameric structure in ssb <dig> mode. a hypothetical model is proposed in figure  <dig>  in this proposed model, all four monomers in the tetramer would first bind to the ssdna, which would likely lead to the formation of the ssb <dig> complex and prevent the formation of a ssb <dig> complex. in the case of ssbba, a two-fold higher concentration of protein was needed to observe the high-fret complex. we believe this is due to the following reasons. first, the ssbba is in essence a mutant form of ssbec and as a result its ssdna binding mechanism is likely somewhat different. second, higher concentration of ssbba might have favored the binding of all four monomers to the ssdna. initial slope of the plot in figure 9b appeared to support this pathway.

ssbba appears to undergo structural transformations which may support its high affinity binding to ssdna. its structure is due to a cumulative effect of multiple changes in key amino acid residues in its sequence which resulted in the loss of stable tetramer formation. nonetheless, the ssbba bound oligo <dig> with high affinity as shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  therefore, multiple monomers will bind to oligo <dig> due to its long size. thus, it is reasonable to assume that four monomers are binding to a long ssdna . fret data presented in figure  <dig> established that ssb65-like structure is being formed upon oligo <dig> binding. therefore, the ssdna binding is leading to the formation of an ssb <dig> complex in which ssdna is bound to a ssbec-like tetrameric structure. we have proposed a hypothetical model, presented in figure  <dig>  which may explain the mechanism of formation of a ssbba tetramer assembly upon ssdna binding which require further studies of such complex formation. the proposed model represents a stepwise process by which ssbba can achieve high affinity dna binding through a tetramer formation. this mechanism of ssb-ssdna complex formation and its reversal may aid in the rapid removal of ssb, a necessary step, by enzymes such as a dna polymerase during dna replication as well as in other processes. in essence, ssbba could actually be more effective than its tetrameric orthologs in executing its multifaceted functions in cellular dna transactions.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies suggest that the structural properties of ssbba differ from that of its gram-negative counterpart, ssbec, and that furthermore its structure is modulated in the presence an ssdna template. it is noteworthy that despite complexities in structure and oligomerization, ssbba retains high-affinity ssdna binding, which is its primary function. its unique structure may be due to the cumulative effect of multiple key amino acid changes in its sequence during evolution, leading to alteration of stable dimer and tetramer formation. in the presence of a long ssdna  appears to form with ssbba a ssb <dig> complex in which ssdna is bound to all four ssb monomers in a tetrameric structure. a proposed model may explain the mechanism of such ssbba-ssdna complex formation through a transient tetramer formation. this model indicates that ssbba may be more efficient in assembly and disassembly of the protein-dna complex particularly during dna replication. the physiological consequence of the unusual structural dynamics of ssbba, could be significant. further studies are required to fully elucidate the role of protein·dna and protein·protein interactions on ssbba protein structure.
