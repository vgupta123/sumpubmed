BACKGROUND
the retina contains six neuronal cell types and one major glial cell type, all of which originated from the same progenitor cell. in vertebrate retinas, the early proliferation of multipotent progenitors produces a sufficient number of cells that will be specified as different retinal cell types at around the time of their cell cycle withdrawal. the cell types that can be specified at a particular stage of development are controlled by both intrinsic and extrinsic signals; and this temporal restriction on cell fate specification is commonly referred to as the competence model  <cit> . in general, ganglion cells  are the first cell type while muller cells  are the last cell type to be specified. these reversibly specified cells then undergo irreversible determination after which their cell fate can not be changed by external signals  <cit> . specification and determination are collectively called commitment. finally, these committed cells undergo terminal differentiation during which they send out neuronal processes and synapse with each other.

many intrinsic factors and extrinsic signals that control retinal cell specification and differentiation have been identified. for example, atoh <dig> and crx are transcription factors that specify retinal ganglion cells  <cit>  and photoreceptors  <cit>  respectively. research on zebrafish retina has also identified key signalling molecules and processes that regulate terminal differentiation and lamination. these include shh  <cit> , cell polarity regulation  <cit> , cell adhesion  <cit>  and chromatin remodelling  <cit> . for example, in a retinal terminal differentiation mutant smarca4a50/a <dig> , all retinal cell types could be specified but failed to fully differentiate due to a null mutation of a chromatin remodelling component smarca <dig>   <cit> . nonetheless, the underlying genetic circuitry that controls terminal differentiation is still poorly understood  <cit> .

in a recent microarray study of retinal development in zebrafish, a factorial design was used to identify specifically smarca4-regulated retinal genes in micro-dissected wild-type  and smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas  <cit> . seven hundred and thirty one genes were identified as regulated by smarca <dig> with different levels of retinal specificity, as defined by the factorial anova model used. in particular,  <dig> genes were grouped in the three-way anova models and considered to have the most specific retinal change. to study the regulation of these genes during retinal development, it is essential to validate their differential expression and elucidate their cellular expression patterns. the present study investigated the cellular expression patterns of  <dig> randomly selected known genes from this group of three-way anova models by whole-mount in situ hybridization. a comparative analysis of the results with the original microarray findings was performed to evaluate the performance of the factorial microarray analysis.

RESULTS
in situ hybridization analysis of smarca4-regulated genes validates differential expression results obtained by factorial microarray analysis
in a recent factorial microarray analysis that aimed at identifying smarca4-regulated retinal genes in micro-dissected retinas  <cit> ,  <dig> genes were categorized in three-way anova models . these genes have the most specific gene expression change in the smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas at  <dig> hours post-fertilization . since the differentiating retinal cells are beginning to organize themselves into three cellular layers and synapse with each other at this stage, the cellular expression analysis of these smarca4-regulated retinal genes would potentially assist further functional characterization of retinal differentiation and lamination.

to facilitate performance evaluation of this microarray analysis approach,  <dig> known genes were randomly selected from these  <dig> genes and whole-mount in situ hybridization performed on embryos collected at the same stages that were used in the microarray analysis. these include wt and smarca4a50/a <dig> embryos at  <dig> &  <dig> hpf. the corresponding retinal samples at the same stages are wr <dig> & wr <dig> for wt, and yr <dig> & yr <dig> for smarca4a50/a <dig> respectively . the factorial microarray analysis also further categorized these  <dig> genes into three functional groups:  smarca4-regulated retinal differentiation genes ,  retinal-specific genes independent of smarca <dig> regulation , and  smarca4-regulated genes outside retina . only genes in the first group have a significant differential retinal gene expression in smarca4a50/a <dig> compared to wt .

among the  <dig> randomly selected known genes for in situ hybridization,  <dig>  are in the functional group  as described above, three  are in group  and none is in group . two  out of the  <dig> genes from group  showed no discernable signal in all retinal samples in the in situ hybridization experiments. for cdh <dig>  there was considerable expression signal detected outside the eye region . this indicates that the probe could detect gene expression. however, there was no discernible expression signal in the eye. for wnt <dig>  since there was no signal in the whole embryo , an additional probe that is deposited in the public domain  was acquired and the in situ hybridization repeated with smarca4a50/a <dig> and their wt siblings, as well as wt embryos collected from ab and tl strains. in all conditions, the staining in the other reported embryonic regions, including otic vesicles, lower jaw and myoseptum, was clearly observed. however, there was no positive staining in the retinas, even after an overnight staining . thus, the in situ hybridization results do not support the expression of wnt <dig> and cdh <dig> in the retinas at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf.

the positive and negative expression results obtained by in situ hybridization serve two purposes. first, they can be used to validate the expression changes obtained by the microarray analysis and in turn the significance inference process. this helps evaluate the performance of the approach. second, the cellular expression patterns of these candidate genes may shed light on their functions. to validate the expression changes obtained by the microarray analysis, the fold changes of the  <dig> smarca4-regulated retinal genes from group  in four comparisons of retinas  were first plotted in a heatmap . these data were then compared with the corresponding expression data obtained by in situ hybridization. even though all samples for each gene were stained for the same period of time, since whole-mount in situ hybridization is not a true quantitative analysis, it was decided that the best way to interpret the data was to elucidate whether the expression level was higher , lower  or not changed  in the corresponding comparisons . first, the expression changes in the in situ hybridization were highly similar to the corresponding fold changes in the microarray analysis . furthermore, an identity matrix was established to compare the observations for all four retinal comparisons  obtained from the microarray analysis with the in situ hybridization . it can be shown that in  <dig> %  of the cases, when there was a significant change in the microarray comparison ; there was a noticeable corresponding in situ hybridization expression change or vice versa . finally, since these genes were originally selected by statistical criteria focused on the smarca4a50/a <dig> vs. wt comparisons, it can be further demonstrated that the identical rate of having a corresponding expression change in the in situ hybridization with only these significant microarray comparisons is  <dig> % . to see if these true positive observations and the theoretical true discovery rate  for significance inference in the microarrays are concordant, a z test was conducted. the p-value is  <dig> , suggesting that there was no significant difference between the theoretical true discovery rate  <cit>  and the actual observation. together, these results suggest that the original factorial microarray analysis can effectively identify true differential expression in micro-dissected zebrafish retinas.

cellular expression patterns of smarca4-regulated retinal genes
the cellular expression patterns of the  <dig> smarca4-regulated genes with positive in situ hybridization signals in the wt retinas were further analyzed as follows. first, their expression domains in  <dig> and  <dig> hpf retinas were recorded from both ventral and lateral views, defined as follows :  for the  <dig> hpf ventral view, three expression domains were defined:  <dig>  ganglion cell/basal region ,  <dig>  outer retina-basal  and  <dig>  outer retina-apical . the basal region should contain differentiating ganglion cells at this stage  <cit> ; however since ganglion cell marker staining were not performed in this study in conjunction with the in situ hybridization, this region may contain cells that belonged to other cell types. thus it is more appropriate to define the expression domain as gc/br. the remaining part of the retina has not yet differentiated at this stage and was defined as or-b and or-a to reflect the observed difference in expression pattern within this area.  for the  <dig> hpf ventral view, five expression regions were defined:  <dig>  ganglion cell layer ,  <dig>  inner nuclear layer-basal ,  <dig>  inner nuclear layer-middle ,  <dig>  inner nuclear layer-apical  and  <dig>  outer nuclear layer . several cell types will ultimately differentiate in the inl, including amacrine cells , bipolar cells , horizontal cells  and mcs, while photoreceptors will occupy the onl.  for the lateral view for both  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, five expression domains were defined:  <dig>  ventral patch ,  <dig>  anterior-ventral ,  <dig>  anterior-dorsal ,  <dig>  posterior-dorsal  and  <dig>  posterior-ventral . the vp has been used to refer to the location from which cells in gcl, inl and onl first differentiate  <cit> ; and is used here to generally refer to staining domain that is found in a very restricted manner on the ventral side of the retina.

then, the similarity of the cellular expression domains from these views between different genes was investigated by hierarchical clustering . dtnbp <dig> and fzd8b were excluded from this clustering analysis. this is because dtnbp1's expression was only intense enough for discerning an over-expression in wt compared with smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas, but not for an unambiguous elucidation of the cellular expression domains . while for fzd8b, it was only over-expressed in yr <dig> and not in either of the wt conditions; thus it would not be informative to include this gene in the clustering of wt cellular expression patterns . the clustering analysis using the remaining  <dig> genes revealed three general groups of expression patterns: 1) photoreceptor layer/onl specific expression at  <dig> hpf , 2) gcl and/or inl specific expression at both  <dig> &  <dig> hpf  and 3) gcl and/or inl specific expression at  <dig> hpf only .

i. photoreceptor layer/onl specific expression at  <dig> hpf
a total of eight genes, including rho, gnat <dig>  guk <dig>  nme2l, elovl <dig>  rcv <dig>  ndrg <dig> and aanat <dig>  were found to express specifically in photoreceptor layer/onl in the wt retinas . their expression was suppressed in all smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas. two sub-clusters were also observed . the genes in the first sub-cluster only expressed in a ventral patch of cells in the retina by  <dig> hpf . the genes in the second sub-cluster expressed to a different degree in the other parts of the onl at the same stage in addition to the ventral patch of the retina , except for ndrg <dig> which did not express in this domain . also, the expression patterns of rho and gnat <dig>  as well as nme2l and elovl <dig> were highly similar and were tightly clustered with each other . interestingly, rho, gnat <dig> and rcv <dig>  components of the visual cycle, were also weakly expressed in the ventral retina at  <dig> hpf . this is earlier than the stage  of the first rho expression previously reported  <cit> , but is consistent with the public in situ hybridization data , which show the first expression of rho in the same location at around the same stage .

ii. gcl and/or inl specific expression at both  <dig> &  <dig> hpf
a group of five genes, including irx4a, barhl <dig>  pbx1a, rlbp1l and irx <dig>  were expressed in wt retinas at both  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . their expressions were all suppressed in smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas at the corresponding stages. these genes were segregated into two sub-clusters because of their diverse expression patterns at  <dig> hpf . the first sub-cluster contains irx4a, barhl <dig> and pbx1a . this group of genes expressed in the gc region at  <dig> hpf to a variable degree . for example, barhl <dig> was expressed in the vp, av, ad and pd but not in the pv domain from the ventral view , suggesting that it is a gene that may be regulated by the neurogenic wave in the retina  <cit> . by  <dig> hpf, all of these three genes were expressing in either the gcl or both gcl and inl-b, which contains the presumptive acs. the second sub-cluster, containing rlbp1l and irx <dig> , is clustered within a larger family of genes that only expressed at  <dig> hpf and will be discussed in the next section. nonetheless, these two genes have a slightly unique expression pattern: whereas they were expressed on the ventral side of the  <dig> hpf retinas , their expression domain was restricted to the whole inl by  <dig> hpf.

iii. gcl and/or inl specific expression at  <dig> hpf only
a total of  <dig> genes  were clustered in a group with a p-value <  <dig>  . among them, only irx <dig> and rlbp1l started to express at  <dig> hpf and were discussed above . for the remaining  <dig> genes in the cluster, they only expressed at  <dig> hpf . interestingly, several genes inside this cluster have a highly similar and unique expression pattern in that they were tightly grouped in two sub-clusters with a p-value
 <  <dig>  . the first sub-cluster consists of four genes - tfap2a, id2a, olfm <dig> and lmo4l  that exclusively expressed in the inl-b, and three genes - calb2l, glra4b and vangl <dig>  that expressed in both gcl and inl-b. the second sub-cluster consists of two genes - robo <dig>  and ckmt <dig>  that both expressed strongly in gcl. also, ckmt <dig> had an addition expression domain in the inl-a. there were three genes - kal1a , ctbp <dig>  and sv2b  that did not belong to these two sub-clusters and formed a separate one. all of them had broad expression domains in inl that at least spanned the inl-m and inl-a. sv2b further expressed in the gcl as well. interestingly, kal1a was strongly expressed in a subset of cells in the ac region that the neuronal processes were intensely stained and highlighted the inner plexiform layer  .

iv. fzd8b only expressed in smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas at  <dig> hpf
fzd8b is a gene that only expressed in smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas at  <dig> hpf at a very low level. its expression appeared to be restricted to the pv and the choroid fissure area . interestingly, it was not expressed at a discernible level in other tissues and stages in both the microarray and in situ hybridization experiments. this suggests that there was a specific up-regulation of fzd8b in the smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas at  <dig> hpf due to the lack of a functional smarca <dig> 

cellular expression patterns of retinal-specific genes that were not inferred to be regulated by smarca4
foxn <dig>  bhlhe <dig> and six3a did not meet the original microarray analysis criteria to be smarca4-regulated retinal genes  and were classified in the functional group  that were shown to have a retinal specific expression at both  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . the in situ hybridization analysis confirmed this retinal specific expression compared to the whole body at all stages . however, it was also noticed that there was a discernible expression difference between wt and smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas in the in situ samples in several instances. these include a slight increase of foxn <dig>  in smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas at  <dig> &  <dig> hpf, a slight increase and decrease of bhlhe <dig> in smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf respectively , and a slight decrease of six3a in smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas at  <dig> hpf . an inspection of the original microarray results indicates that the sign of the fold changes matched with the expression changes as determined by in situ hybridization and the average microarray expression values in all these comparisons were considerably higher than the background. however, the magnitude of the fold changes was not larger than  <dig> . this suggests that the selection criteria were stringent in inferring smarca4-regulated retinal genes, but might be too stringent for detecting subtle changes. alternatively, in situ hybridization, despite being able to reveal cellular expression patterns, is intrinsically not a quantitative method. the detection threshold varies and is affected by a number of experimental factors. the changes as observed may not be superior to the microarrays measurements. hence it would be wise to combine both types of approach and stringent statistical criteria for selecting candidates for further experimental investigations.

discussion
this study has successfully investigated the expression of  <dig> genes identified from a microarray study of smarca4-regulated retinal genes from micro-dissected zebrafish retinas and elucidated the cellular expression patterns. the original microarray analysis has inferred  <dig> of these  <dig> genes as smarca4-regulated retinal genes and the remaining three as retinal specific genes whose expression is independent of smarca <dig> regulation. the in situ hybridization analysis has demonstrated that the sign of the expression changes matches with the microarray results well . in particular,  <dig> %  of the significant microarray expression comparisons have a corresponding differential expression between wt and smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas in the in situ hybridization experiments. this suggests strongly that factorial microarray analysis, can efficiently detect true biological differences among different types of micro-dissected zebrafish retinas. twenty seven out of the  <dig> smarca4-regulated retinal genes have a positive in situ hybridization signal in the retinas, and  <dig> of them have the cellular expression domains that could be clearly discerned. three general groups of expression patterns can be identified from these  <dig> genes : 1) photoreceptor layer/onl specific expression at  <dig> hpf, 2) gcl and/or inl specific expression at both  <dig> &  <dig> hpf and 3) gcl and/or inl specific expression at  <dig> hpf only.

the acquisition of the cellular expression patterns and the clustering of these genes can facilitate downstream characterization, because genes that are expressed in the same domain are likely to be regulated by the same upstream factor and/or are used to control development and functions of specific cell type. for example, a group of photoreceptor/onl genes were expressed on the ventral side of wt retinas at  <dig> hpf and were suppressed in the smarca4a50/a <dig> retinas . this is the beginning stage of photoreceptor generation in the ventronasal patch of the retina  <cit> , and many of these genes are related to the visual cycle. interestingly, rcv <dig> and aanat <dig> are expressed in virtually the whole onl at  <dig> hpf in addition to the ventronasal patch , while ndrg <dig> is expressed in the whole onl but not the ventronasal patch at this stage . this extensive expression pattern is obviously different from the previously reported expression patterns of cones and rods differentiation, as indicated by the wave-like expression pattern of cone opsin and sporadic expression of rod opsin respectively starting from the ventronasal retina at around  <dig> hpf  <cit> . since rcv <dig> also participates in the visual cycle  <cit> , the extensive expression of rcv <dig>  aanat <dig> and ndrg <dig> in the onl at  <dig> hpf suggests that there may be a different regulatory circuit that controls their expression. together with the detection of rho, gnat <dig> and rcv <dig> in the ventral retina at  <dig> hpf , these observations also suggest that the differentiation program of photoreceptors may begin earlier than 50- <dig> hpf. in the second example, a few genes including tfap2a, id2a, olfm <dig> and lmo4l , are expressed specifically on the basal side of the inl which is the presumptive region of acs. their expression domains were highly overlapped with each other that these genes were grouped together in a highly significant sub-cluster . this suggests that they may play a role in acs development. indeed, a recent perturbation experiment of id2a in zebrafish  <cit>  have demonstrated such a role. in addition, the knockout of an orthologue of lmo4l, lmo <dig>  in mice leads to a reduction of amacrine cells  <cit> . in the third example, barhl <dig> is a gene that has been demonstrated to regulate the development of gcs and acs in mice  <cit> . its expression pattern in the zebrafish correlates nicely with the development of gcs and acs , suggesting that barhl <dig> is likely to play a similar role in zebrafish retinal development.

one key objective of the original microarray study was to identify smarca4-regulated retinal genes because their expression should either mediate terminal differentiation and/or be a consequence of terminal differentiation. the hallmarks of terminal differentiation of neurons include neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis, which would be manifested as the formation of the retinal lamination. the current in situ hybridization analysis of the candidate genes, which are mostly differentially expressed at  <dig> hpf, during which the retinal lamination is first observed, may potentially provide new insights into the molecular control of this process. there are at least two non-exclusive possibilities: 1) these genes control the differentiation of a specific cell type which in turn orchestrates the formation of the final neuronal connection and lamination and/or 2) these genes control patterning and lamination of the retina directly. in the microarray study, it was speculated that tfap <dig>  id <dig> and irx transcription factor families would play a key role in retinal differentiation and lamination  <cit> , and this has been proven by studies of tfap2a knockout mice  <cit> , and id2a  <cit>  and irx1a  <cit>  knockdowns in zebrafish. in fact, id2a has also been demonstrated to play a role in the development of acs as discussed above and the knockdown of tfap2c in tfap2a zebrafish mutant shows a very severe eye development phenotype, in which the eye size becomes significantly smaller  <cit> . these results together suggest that these transcription factor families are integral components of retinal differentiation and lamination, and that the remaining members of these groups may play key roles in retinal development. indeed, our investigation has demonstrated that irx <dig>  a gene that has an expression pattern that spans the whole inl at  <dig> hpf, plays a role in the differentiation of both inl and photoreceptors, as well as lamination . also, in the original microarray study, cdk <dig> and activators were demonstrated to play a role in retinal differentiation  <cit> . the execution of their functions likely involves a subset of the genes presented in this study. thus, the knockdown of these key mediators of smarca4-network and subsequent in situ hybridization analysis of the other smarca4-regulated genes, which is currently in progress, will likely further the understanding of retinal differentiation.

while the microarray analysis accurately excluded genes that did not meet all criteria to be smarca4-regulated retinal genes, some of these excluded genes might have a role in subtle developmental change in retinas that are regulated by smarca <dig>  for instance, the fold change of a key transcription factor in a network can be less than two, and yet it can play a substantial role in the developmental process that it controls. foxn <dig> was excluded by the original microarray analysis as being a smarca4-regulated retinal gene because its fold change was below the two-fold cut-off despite having a significant corresponding contrast. nonetheless, it was obvious that there was a discernible difference in the expression level and cellular expression pattern of this gene between wr <dig> and yr <dig> . the expression seemed to be relatively higher on the dorsal side of the wr52; while in yr <dig>  the expression was generally higher but there was no such regional difference. in addition, the expression of foxn <dig> at  <dig> hpf is restricted to the proliferative marginal zone region; while at  <dig> hpf, it is primarily located in the proliferative part of the retinal neuro-epithelium . these results suggest that foxn <dig> may also play a role in the smarca4-regulated retinal differentiation through the regulation of the retinal progenitors. indeed, foxn <dig> has been demonstrated to express in retinal progenitor cells in mice and the null mutant has retinal dysplasia  <cit> . while a small and consistent fold change of a gene can be biologically significant, it is necessary to implement a cut-off to ensure the false discovery rate is low. this is a necessary trade-off to maximize the number of true positive genes, especially in the first genomic study of micro-dissected zebrafish retinas. it is obvious that while the original factorial microarray analysis have efficiently identified true smarca4-regulated retinal expression, it is possible that some genes that are subtly regulated by smarca <dig> did not meet the statistical cut-off and were excluded from this category.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has investigated the expression of  <dig> genes identified from a factorial microarray analysis that was designed for searching smarca4-regulated retinal genes. twenty nine of them were grouped in this category while three were excluded by the original analysis. the in situ hybridization results have strongly supported that the original factorial microarray analysis can efficiently identify true smarca4-regulated retinal genes with a true positive rate of  <dig> %. thus, this gene list is not only a rich source for cell-type specific markers, but also may assist in formulating new hypothesis to study the underlying genetic regulatory circuits that control retinal development.
