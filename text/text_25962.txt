BACKGROUND
various clinical and pre-clinical investigations have indicated that antagonists of the glucocorticoid receptor  could be useful in the treatment of diabetes  <cit>  and depression  <cit> , but concerns about the effects of gr antagonists on the body's ability to regulate inflammatory responses  <cit>  have hampered development of gr antagonists for these indications.

activation of the gr with endogenous glucocorticoids  is the body's primary method for suppression of the inflammatory response  <cit> . in fact, host survival in bacterial and viral infection is dependent upon the proper control of the inflammatory response through timely activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis for the production of cortisol, the primary glucocorticoid in humans  <cit> . the innate immune system stimulates the controlled production and timely release of gcs to prevent an overly strong response to an ongoing localized inflammatory process  <cit> . disruption of this response due to exhaustion of the adrenal cortex results in septic shock. in the treatment of septic shock, low doses of gcs have therapeutic effects by correcting adrenal cortex exhaustion, exerting appropriate anti-inflammatory properties, and enhancing endogenous catecholamine effects  <cit> .

antagonism of the gr by mifepristone , pharmacologically classified as both a progesterone and glucocorticoid antagonist  <cit> , has been shown to ameliorate metabolic parameters in rodent model of type  <dig> diabetes   <cit> . however, the potential for gr antagonists to exacerbate inflammation is a major concern limiting the use of gr antagonists for the treatment of diabetes, depression, and other conditions. it was postulated that ru <dig> could exacerbate the inflammatory response and lead to septic shock through inhibition of the body's mechanism for controlling inflammation by virtue of its ability to block the gr in phagocytes located at the site of invading bacteria  <cit> , by disrupting the negative pituitary feedback, and by deteriorating adrenal cortex exhaustion  <cit> . in experimental animals, blockade of the gr by ru <dig> was shown to increase the mortality of endotoxemic rats administered lipopolysaccharide, and to increase tnfα production and toxicity  <cit> . there have also been reports of deaths from septic shock in patients using ru <dig> as an abortifacient  <cit> .

the association between use of ru <dig> and deaths from septic shock has only been reported under the condition of abortion . no causal relationship has been established between ru <dig> and septic shock. the use of ru <dig> in cushing's syndrome  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit> , endometriosis  <cit> , and leiomyoma  <cit>  has not been associated with septic shock, although all the applications are also based on either progesterone receptor antagonism or gr antagonism. the incidence of septic shock may depend on disease conditions and ru <dig> dosages.

in the effort to develop gr antagonists for chronic treatment of diabetes, we desired to investigate the acute and chronic effect of gr antagonist on the inflammatory responses in animals under both normal and disease conditions at doses that are efficacious in the treatment of t2d. therefore, the current study investigated the effect of acute and chronic use of ru <dig> on inflammatory cytokines in various mouse models, including normal akr mice and two rodent models of t2d, the monogenic leptin receptor defect db/db mice and the diet-induced obese  c57bl/ <dig> mice.

RESULTS
ru <dig> dose-dependently decreased blood glucose but did not affect serum cytokines in db/db mice
at an age of 11– <dig> weeks, db/db mice had significantly higher levels of blood glucose, hba1c, serum insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and interleukin- <dig> , and similar level of serum monocyte chemoattractant protein- <dig>  compared with the c57bl/6j lean litter mates . serum tumor necrosis factor alpha  and interleukin-1beta  were below quantifiable levels  in both db/db mice and their lean litter mates. the db/db mice also had significantly higher levels of serum corticosterone, similar levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone , and higher expression levels of hepatic glucogenesis enzyme phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase  and glucose-6-phosphatase  genes compared with the c57bl/6j lean litter mates .

bql: below quantifiable level.

treatment of the db/db mice at an age 10– <dig> weeks with gr antagonist ru <dig> for  <dig> days significantly decreased postprandial blood glucose in a dose- and time-dependent manner , confirming the glucose lowering effect of ru <dig> and establishing the efficacious dose. ru <dig> down-regulated hepatic pepck expression levels , and trended to lower g6pase  gene expression, and increased serum levels of corticosterone  and acth  in db/db mice. ru <dig> did not affect serum mcp- <dig> and il- <dig> levels in the db/db mice .

ru <dig> decreased lps-induced serum tnfα in normal akr mice along with an increase in serum corticosterone
as shown in fig  <dig>  ninety minutes after lps intraperitoneal  injection, serum tnfα and il- <dig> levels were increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. the lps doses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/kg were the at the lower part of the dose-response curve for tnfα induction , indicating that these doses should be far from the exhausting capacity for tnfα production. the  <dig> minute exposure time was also in the middle of tnfα release curve . the lps-induced il- <dig> production, which was much more sensitive than tnfα production, reached a maximal level at an lps dose of  <dig>  mg/kg  <dig> minutes after exposure . in the subsequent studies of lps challenge in akr mice, the middle lps doses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/kg, an exposure time of  <dig> minutes, and the parameter of tnfα production were employed.

while lps doses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/kg increased serum tnfα to different levels, oral ru <dig> significantly inhibited both lps  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/kg-induced increase in serum tnfα. this inhibition trended to be dose-dependent and is opposite to the proposed pro-inflammation effects of ru <dig> . both lps  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/kg resulted in significantly higher serum corticosterone  and acth . pre-treatment with ru <dig> further increased serum corticosterone in these animals, but did not affect the lps-elevated acth .

ru <dig> decreased low dose lps-induced serum tnfα in c57bl/ <dig> dio mice along with an increase in serum corticosterone, but did not affect the high dose lps-mediated changes
after 12– <dig> weeks on cafeteria diet, c57bl/ <dig> mice had a phenotype of higher body weight, serum glucose and insulin, dyslipidemia, and had higher serum tnfα and similar il- <dig>  compared to normal diet controls. acute lps challenge in c57bl/ <dig> dio mice markedly increased serum tnfα in a dose-dependent manner , which was more pronounced than that in normal diet controls . pretreatment with ru <dig> decreased the low dose  <dig>  mg/kg lps-induced serum tnfα, but did not affect the higher dose  <dig>  mg/kg lps-elevated serum tnfα . lps increased serum corticosterone in the c57bl/ <dig> dio mice . pretreatment with ru <dig> further increased the lps -elevated serum corticosterone but did not affect serum acth .

in another experiment, c57bl/ <dig> dio mice were ip injected with lps at the dose of  <dig> mg/kg. this high dose of lps led to inactivity and diarrhea in mice, an exaggerated increase in serum tnfα, and moderate increases in serum corticosterone and acth . pretreatment with ru <dig> in the c57bl/ <dig> dio mice did not affect the high dose lps-mediated changes in serum tnfα, corticosterone, and acth .

discussion
the current study demonstrated that chronic treatment with gr antagonist ru <dig> for  <dig> days dose-dependently decreased postprandial blood glucose, increased serum corticosterone and acth, and did not affect serum mcp- <dig> and il- <dig>  in db/db mice. injection of lps increased circulating tnfα, corticosterone, and acth in both normal akr mice and c57bl/ <dig> dio mice. ru <dig> suppressed the lower dose lps-elevated serum tnfα in both normal akr mice and c57bl/ <dig> dio mice, and further increased circulating corticosterone. the ru <dig> pretreatment did not affect the high dose lps -mediated changes in serum tnfα and corticosterone. it is worth noting that the data sets from each strain/model examined were not exactly the same in current studies. but all the studies showed that ru <dig> either decreased cytokine along with increased corticosterone, or did not affect cytokine along with or without change in corticosterone. thus ru <dig>  at doses which are efficacious on glucose lowering, did not show any exacerbating effect on cytokine production in both chronic and acute settings, and ru <dig> could actually suppress the lower dose lps-mediated tnfα release, possibly due to the increased release of gcs. the interpretation of the data sets were discussed below.

although gr antagonism has been shown to inhibit gluconeogenesis and lower glucose in humans  <cit>  and in rodent model of t2d  <cit> , the concern about gr antagonists on pro-inflammation hampers the long-term treatment with gr antagonists in t2d. the current study used db/db mice to determine the effect of chronic ru <dig> on circulating cytokines, which is a simulative study to mimic drug use in patients with t2d. the authors found that ru <dig> dose-dependently decreased postprandial blood glucose, increased serum corticosterone and acth, but did not affect serum mcp- <dig> and il- <dig>  although the basal il- <dig> was higher in db/db mice than in the lean littermate controls. the significantly higher level of il- <dig> in the db/db mice is consistent with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. the changes in glucose, corticosterone, and acth in ru486-treated db/db mice were consistent with relevant literature reports, and confirmed the efficacious drug exposure . these findings suggest that ru <dig> did not further enhance inflammation in this mouse model of t2d with low grade inflammation. the dose-effect curves of ru <dig> on glucose, corticosterone, and acth were used to decide the ru <dig> doses 4– <dig> mg/kg used in the subsequent acute studies.

in the treatment of septic shock, low doses of glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory properties. gr antagonists might block the anti-inflammatory effect of endogenous cortisol, and deteriorate inflammation. excessive lps release from the bacterial wall into the circulation is the primary pathogenic process of septic shock  <cit> . to evaluate the effect of ru <dig> under the condition of septic shock, an lps-challenge model was used in the current studies. we found that in normal akr mice, lps dose-dependently increased serum tnfα and caused increases in corticosterone and acth. since lps-increased circulating tnfα and other circulating cytokines can trigger the neural circuits that control the hpa axis  <cit> , the increases in corticosterone and acth in response to lps challenge were an expected stress response of hpa axis  <cit> . interestingly, pretreatment with ru <dig> dose-dependently decreased serum tnfα, which is contrary to the hypothesis that ru <dig> would exacerbate inflammation. there was also a dose-dependent increase in circulating corticosterone in response to ru <dig> treatment, which is a well known compensatory reaction in response to the gr antagonism. thus the suppression of lps-mediated tnfα production in ru486-treated mice was most likely a consequence of the increased circulating corticosterone. because of the compensatory increase in endogenous glucocorticoids, acute gr antagonism with ru <dig> does not necessarily lead to exacerbation of inflammation.

it has been reported that diet-induced obesity or/and diet-induced insulin resistance in mice is associated with low grade inflammation, as evidenced by macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue and increased serum cytokines  <cit> . chronic low-grade inflammation in these mice could alter the effects of ru <dig> on lps-induced tnfα production compared to the effects in normal mice. therefore, we used c57bl/ <dig> dio mice to determine the effects of lps and ru <dig>  the phenotype of the c57bl/ <dig> dio mice was consistent with the literature  <cit> . while the lps-induced increases in serum tnfα and corticostrone were similar to those in normal akr mice, the effects of ru <dig> pretreatment on the lps-mediated changes in c57bl/ <dig> dio mice were different than that in the normal akr mice. ru <dig> suppressed  <dig>  mg/kg lps-induced tnfα production but did not affect  <dig>  mg/kg lps-induced tnfα production, despite the fact that ru <dig> further increased serum corticosterone at both lps doses. thus, under these conditions, the compensatory increase in glucocorticoids was not able to suppress lps-induced tnfα production.

considering that the stress response during sepsis could exhaust adrenal cortex, a very high dose of exogenous lps could mimic this state and would exhaust the endogenous glucocorticoids. under these conditions, ru <dig> may no longer be able to cause compensatory glucocorticoid release. whether ru <dig> pretreatment exacerbates lps-induced tnfα production under this condition is not known. therefore, we used lps  <dig> mg/kg in c57bl/ <dig> dio mice to observe the effect of ru <dig> in this stressed condition. we found that this very high dose of lps led to an exaggerated increase in serum tnfα, but increases in serum corticosterone and acth were similar to those observed after lps  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/kg. ru <dig> pretreatment did not affect the  <dig> mg/kg lps-mediated changes in tnfα, corticosterone, and acth. despite this lack of increase in glucocorticoids, ru <dig> did not enhance tnfα production.

there are a few papers reporting gr agonist activity of ru <dig> in some in vitro and in vivo systems. nordeen et al  <cit>  reported that protein kinase a activators unmasked the agonist effect of ru <dig> as mediating an induction of hormone-responsive report genes. zhang et al  <cit>  reported that the gr agonist activities of ru <dig> were dependent on the gr levels but not on ec <dig> values in cos- <dig> cells transfected with gr expression vector. schulz et al  <cit>  reported that the ru486-induced gr agonism was controlled by the receptor n terminus and by corepressor binding. all these reports indicated that ru <dig> may act as a gr agonist under certain conditions on certain pathways/procedures. this agonist activity of ru <dig> may contribute to our observation of decreasing lps-induced tnfα by ru <dig> in normal akr mice and c57bl/ <dig> dio mice. although the mechanism and extent of gr agonist activities of ru <dig> in whole animals is not known, the gr agonist activities of ru <dig> reduce the extent of, and concerns about, potential inflammatory exacerbation by the drug.

as demonstrated in the current studies, lps challenge is a strong stress to the subjects. lps not only increases cytokine production , but also stimulates hpa axis and leads to increases in both serum corticosterone and acth. the levels of cytokine, acth, and corticosterone are considered to be the homeostatic status under the lps-challenge. in the hpa axis, gcs have negative feedback effects on hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland. gr antagonism with ru <dig> blocks the gr throughout body tissues and even blocks gcs' negative feedback receptors in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland. this blockade leads to activation of hpa, and results in increased rate of synthesis and release of acth and gcs. the current studies in akr mice and c57bl/ <dig> dio mice demonstrated that the acute ru <dig> pretreatment resulted in an increase only in corticosterone but not in acth. this finding indicates that gcs may have a negative feedback on the adrenal cortex, thus regulating its own synthesis and release.

although the  <dig> deaths of septic shock were reported to be associated with use of ru <dig>  <cit> , and antagonism of the gr was hypothesized to be the primary cause  <cit> , the current studies in three different strains of animals with normal and abnormal metabolism have not shown inflammatory exacerbation by ru <dig> treatment. this suggests, notwithstanding the species and strain differences, that mechanisms other than, or along with, antagonism of the gr may contribute to the inflammatory exacerbation exhibited by ru <dig> in obstetric/gynecologic clinic. ru <dig> also blocks progesterone receptors  <cit> , and progesterone also demonstrates anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . therefore, the septic shock associated with use of ru <dig> as abortifacient may not be solely due to antagonism of the gr by ru <dig>  the exact cause of these deaths needs to be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies demonstrated that chronic treatment with gr antagonist ru <dig> in db/db mice and acute use of ru <dig> in lps-challenged normal and dio mice did not show any evidence of exacerbating cytokine production. these findings suggest that the compensatory increase in circulating gcs induced by ru <dig> treatment results in an net anti-inflammatory effect, and suggest that the septic shock associated with use of ru <dig> as an abortifacient is not solely due to gr antagonism.
