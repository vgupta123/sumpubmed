BACKGROUND
the distribution of adaptive genetic variation has become of upmost importance in domesticated and wild tree species for the management of natural resources and gene conservation  <cit> . monitoring of genetic diversity for adaptive traits in plants is usually implemented in common garden experiments. forest tree population geneticists have struggled for decades with the establishment of such experiments called provenance tests, aiming at exploring the range and distribution of genetic variation of fitness related traits. however, such investigations are extremely costly, as most traits can only be evaluated after trees have reached the adult stage. hence provenance and progeny tests have been mainly limited to woody species of short rotation and of economic importance, and usually undergoing intensive breeding efforts. species of lower economic interests or long generation tree species, for which no breeding activities could be conducted, have been largely unexplored for their natural genetic variation. for these species, genomics may offer a short cut to field tests for exploring gene diversity, provided that genes of adaptive significance have been identified. in this respect, our objective was to develop an extensive catalogue of gene sequences that can be used for exploring genetic variation in natural populations of tree species of widespread ecological importance such as oaks.

oaks belong to the genus quercus, which comprises several hundred diploid and highly heterozygous species spreading throughout the northern hemisphere, from the tropical to the boreal regions  <cit> . the distribution encompasses strong ecological and climatic gradients in the eurasiatic as in the american continents, in an almost continuous pattern. throughout its natural range, the genus has differentiated into numerous species and populations adapted to extremely variable habitats from swamps to deserts and from sea level up to  <dig>  meters in the himalayas, and expressed in very different life history traits  <cit> . because of their longevity and their very large geographic distribution, oaks are also key drivers of terrestrial biodiversity as they harbour large communities of insects, fungi, and vertebrates  <cit> . we expect that the discovery of genes of adaptive significance in oaks may therefore lead to significant progress in the evolutionary genetics and ecology of whole communities.

the genus quercus belongs to the fagaceae family, that comprises other genera of ecological significance mainly castanea , fagus , castanopsis and lithocarpus  <cit> . phylogenetic and historical investigations suggest a very rapid differentiation among the different genera, and the persistence of strong genetic relationships, especially between quercus, castanea, castanopsis, and lithocarpus  <cit> . indeed earlier reports of comparative mapping indicate strong macrocolineratity within linkage groups between quercus and castanea  <cit> . hence, gene sequences of oaks may lead to a broad range of genetic investigations within one of the largest distributed tree family.

in this study we describe the construction and analyse the content of wide est data corresponding to the first large scale exploration of the transcriptome of oaks. a total of  <dig> cdna libraries were constructed from mrna extracted from bud, leaf, root and wood forming tissue of the two main european white oak species . tissues were also collected from abiotically challenged trees. after clustering and contig assembly of est sequences, comparative analysis was conducted to assign functional annotation through similarity searches. the project led to the construction of a biological resource accessible at the repository centre established by the evoltree network of excellence http://www.evoltree.eu/index.php/repository-centre and a database where assembly and annotations and putative snp and ssr markers are available http://genotoul-contigbrowser.toulouse.inra.fr:9092/quercus_robur/index.html. this resource is vitally important not only for genomic and genetic research in oaks and related species, but also for larger communities harboured by oak ecosystems.

RESULTS

sanger sequencing
we produced  <dig>  sanger reads from  <dig> cdna libraries , including ten libraries from q. petraea and ten from q. robur. there were nine suppression subtractive hybridization  and  <dig> cdna libraries. we used five different experimental systems  for library construction. two systems were used for ssh libraries, while three systems were used for cdna libraries. the maximum and minimum number of genotypes in a library was  <dig> for library d and  <dig> for libraries b and i, respectively. there were seven bud, seven root, four leaf and two differentiating secondary xylem libraries. all sequences were subjected to pre-processing  to remove library specific cloning-vector and adaptor sequences, to mask low complexity sequences, to eliminate contaminants and poor-quality sequences . the resulting sanger catalogue contained  <dig>  high quality sequences that are available at the est section of embl. furthermore, all of the chromatograms can be downloaded from the surf web site http://surf.toulouse.inra.fr/ with user name  and password .

library codes are as in table  <dig> 

the sequencing success rate  as well as the average length of high quality sequences varied depending on libraries . excluding the three suppression subtractive hybridization  libraries  for which these two parameters were among the lowest, the former parameter ranged from 69% to  <dig> % and the latter from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. overall, the average read length of high quality sequences was  <dig> bp.

surf detected  <dig> chloroplastic  reads, corresponding to a global rate of  <dig> % . cp sequences were detected in all tissue types, including leaves and buds at quite high rate, ranging from  <dig> to 10% , but also in root  and xylem  at a much lower rate. there were three reads that matched with e. coli sequence. surf tagged a total of  <dig>  sequences as 'not valid'  including  <dig>  and  <dig> sequences flagged as 'doubtful' , and 'pcrkitful' , respectively. interestingly, most of these low quality sequences were found in libraries constructed with the lambdazap kit  as well as in three ssh libraries . it should also be noted that about 1/ <dig>  of the 'doubtful' sequences could be attributed without ambiguity to chimeras, because they presented library specific sequences in the  interval of the sequence. trace2dbest pipeline  <cit>  also detected  <dig> reads with putative chimeras. out of  <dig> chimeras judged by this pipeline, only one read was common with those detected by surf. the difference may result from the different phred  <cit>  and cross_match  <cit>  parameters. trace2dbest uses phred error probability cut-off of  <dig>   of 13), while that in surf was  <dig>  . the sequence regions with the specified qv were expected to be longer in sequences processed by trace2dbest than by surf. theoretically, the probability to detect a chimera is higher for larger sequences. unfortunately, trace2dbest had less stringent parameters in cross_match compared to surf, which decreased the rate of chimera detection. this comparison clearly shows that parameter optimization to detect possible chimera is necessary for each study objectives. for example, if the goal is to provide a global view of the transcriptome, chimeric clones do not cause large problems. however, if the goal is to bioinformatically infer full-length cdnas, chimeric clones must be strictly eliminated.

454-sequencing
we constructed nine libraries from q. petraea and five from q. robur . six libraries were established from mrna extracted from the parental lines of mapping pedigrees and consisted of leaves and buds from single individuals. they were sequenced by  <dig> titanium. there were four libraries from buds, two from leaves and buds and two from flowers. these eight libraries were sequenced by  <dig> gs-flx. in total  <dig> , <dig> reads were produced. the average read length varied from  <dig> to  <dig> bp for libraries sequenced by gs-flx and from  <dig> to  <dig> bp for those sequenced by titanium . we used the ng <dig> pipeline  to detect contaminants by blast search and found yeast sequences in nine out of  <dig> libraries . no e. coli and phage sequences were found in libraries sequenced by gs-flx, while they were detected in all the libraries sequenced by titanium. average depth estimated based on the newbler assembler was higher  and unique sequence rate was lower  for libraries sequenced by titanium compared to gs-flx .

we used the pyrocleaner program from ng <dig> to identify too short or too long sequences, dirty sequences, low complexity sequences and duplicated reads as defined in the methods section. depending on the library, from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  of the reads presented these features . overall, libraries sequenced by titanium showed lower number of low quality sequences , while those sequenced by gs-flx showed higher values . in particular, the duplication rate was higher in libraries sequenced by gs-flx  compared to titanium .

coverage of transcripts within libraries
transcript coverage was estimated by inferring relationship between number of ests in a library and number of contigs  as detailed in the methods section. for libraries sequenced by the sanger method , the maximum coverage  was obtained for library j, followed by library t . these two libraries were constructed by creator smart kit  and sequenced from both 3' and 5' directions . they showed the plateau for the number of contigs in oakcontigv <dig> at the number of ests around  <dig>  . this means  <dig>  ests were enough to represent the transcripts in these libraries. on the other hand, library k showed the minimum transcript coverage of  <dig> % with  <dig>  ests . to achieve the coverage greater than 80% in library k, about  <dig>  ests may have been necessary. libraries sequenced by pyrosequencing achieved a coverage greater than 80% . furthermore, for libraries sequenced by titanium platform , the coverage was virtually 100%, which was probably attained by both mixing rnas from different tissues and normalization procedure used to construct these libraries .

assembly
we produced three kinds of assemblies using three different approaches . first, we processed the  <dig>  sanger reads  resulting from the trace2dbest analysis using the partigene pipeline <cit>  and produced  <dig>  unigene elements, containing  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons . contigs were defined in sequence assembly, resulting from multiple reads, while singletons were unique sequence that were not clustered with any other reads or that were not assembled with any other reads in a cluster. the distribution of sequence length  of contigs and singletons is indicated in additional file 3: figure s <dig> . while the mode of the distribution resided in the  contained two ests,  <dig>   contained three ests,  <dig>   contained four ests,  <dig>   contained five ests and  <dig>   contained more than five ests . the average and maximum number of ests in a single contig was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the average gc content of this unigene sets was  <dig> %. when we compared these results with other similar studies , the statistics of the oak assembly were within the range of what has been reported so far in plants. positive relationships between the different quantities  were evident. even though the number of ests collected was different for each study, the percentages of contigs within each unigene set was nearly identical , except for the cocoa est assembly.

# debris was excluded. mira classified  <dig>  reads as debris. if debris is considered as singletons, the number of singletons and unigenes elements by mira would become  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

second, we used the sigenae system  to bring together in the same analysis  <dig>  sanger and  <dig> , <dig> 454-reads. overall,  <dig>  elements  tentative consensus sequences  and  <dig>   singletons; oakcontigv1) were obtained . the average and maximum length of contigs was  <dig> bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the distribution of sequence length  of contigs and singletons is indicated in additional file 3: figure s <dig> . the distribution was bimodal for both contigs and singletons. the first peak for singletons resided in  resided. the second peak for singletons laid in the  resided. for contigs, the mode was located at the  that were made up from gs-flx reads only. the average and maximum depth of contigs was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the deepest contig was  <dig>  bp and presented similarity with a chloroplast membrane protein from mercurialis perennis at e-value of 6e- <dig>  of the  <dig>  tcs,  <dig>   contained two ests,  <dig>   contained three ests,  <dig>   contained four ests and  <dig>   contained more than four ests . overall the  <dig>  tcs contained  <dig> , <dig> sequences. among the  <dig>  tcs,  <dig>   consisted of 454-reads only, while  <dig>   were made up of sanger reads only . in total,  <dig>   of the 454-reads did not cluster to sanger reads . this also means that  <dig> % of the 454-reads clustered with sanger reads. the average gc content of oakcontigv <dig> was  <dig> %.

graphical interface to browse oakcontigv <dig> was constructed using the ensembl tool ). browsing similarity annotation, snp alignments and data mining by biomart are also available as described in detail in fleury et al.  <cit> . all of the data can be downloaded from the web site.

third, we used mira software  <cit>  to produce direct 454-sanger hybrid assembly. this analysis resulted into  <dig>  unigene elements including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons . there were also  <dig>  so called "debris" reads, including  <dig>  sanger and  <dig>  454-reads. about  <dig> %  of the sequences in the 'debris' corresponded to  <dig> % of the oakcontigv <dig> singletons. the number of sanger and 454-reads included in assembly was  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  respectively. the distribution of sequence length  of contigs and singletons is indicated in additional file 3: figure s <dig> . for contigs, the mode was located on the  that were made up of gs-flx reads only. among the  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>   consisted of 454-reads only, while  <dig>   were made up of sanger reads only . in total,  <dig>   of the 454-reads did not cluster to sanger reads . this also means that  <dig> % of the 454-reads clustered together with sanger reads, a similar  value to that obtained using tgicl. the average and maximum length of contigs was  <dig> bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively ). the average and maximum depth of contigs was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, that is almost twice smaller than that obtained with tgicl. of the  <dig>  tcs,  <dig>   contained two ests,  <dig>   contained three ests,  <dig>   contained four ests and  <dig>   contained more than four ests. overall the  <dig>  tcs contained  <dig> , <dig> sequences. the average gc content of this unigene sets was  <dig> %. a total of  <dig> % of the reads that did not clustered with sanger reads using either mira or tgicl assembler were identical.

reciprocal best blast hits  were searched between unigene elements constructed by mira and tgicl, partigene and tgicl, as well as between partigene and mira. in total  <dig>  sequences were identified as rbh between mira and tgicl  unigene elements, which accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of mira and oakcontigv <dig> unigene elements, respectively. in terms of contigs,  <dig> % of mira and  <dig> % oakcontigv <dig> contigs had rbhs, while in terms of singletons,  <dig> % of mira and  <dig> % of oakcontigv <dig> singletons presented rbhs. this low percentage is due to the fact that mira classified most of the singletons as 'debris'. there were  <dig>  rbhs between partigene and oakcontigv <dig> unigene elements, which accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of partigene and oakcontigv <dig> unigene elements, respectively. in terms of contigs,  <dig> % of partigene and  <dig> % oakcontigv <dig> contigs had rbhs, while in terms of singletons,  <dig> % of partigene and  <dig> % of oakcontigv <dig> singletons had rbhs. there were  <dig>  rbhs between partigene and mira unigene elements, which accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of partigene and mira unigene elements, respectively. in terms of contigs,  <dig> % of partigene and  <dig> % of mira contigs had rbh, while in terms of singletons,  <dig> % of partigene and  <dig> % of mira singletons presented rbhs.

by the addition of 454-reads, the number of unigene elements was greatly increased from  <dig>  based on the partigene assembly to  <dig>  in oakcontigv <dig>  this is due to  <dig>  454-singletons and  <dig>  contigs that contain only 454-reads. in total, these  <dig>  454-unigene elements accounted for  <dig> % of the oakcontigv <dig> sequences, comprising  <dig> % of the 454-reads. it should also be pointed out that  <dig> %  of the  <dig>  partigene singletons also present in oakcontigv <dig> were present as contig member of the tgicl assembly. in addition, mapping 454-reads onto the partigene assembly  showed that  <dig>   reads were mapped, including  <dig>   reads on contigs. the rest of the 454-reads did not find corresponding sequences within the partigene sanger assembly. because  <dig> % of 454-reads were assembled with at least one sanger read in oakcontigv <dig>  this simple mapping procedure resulted into a much lower rate of integration of 454-reads. all together, these results indicate the value of the combined assembly approach based on tgicl and the added value of 454-reads to assemble sanger reads into contigs. when the assembly was carried out based on 454-reads only using the mira assembler, we found that  <dig>  decrease in the number of unigene elements,  <dig>  bp  decrease in the length of contigs. sanger reads contributed more to the length of contigs than to the number of unigene elements.

detection of unique peptide elements
starting from  <dig>  unigene elements in oakcontigv <dig>  framedp  <cit>  predicted peptides for  <dig>   of them , resulting in  <dig>  predicted peptides. a single peptide was predicted for  <dig>   elements of oakcontigv <dig>  while the rest produced multiple peptides. the maximum number of predicted peptides from one sequence of oakcontigv <dig> was seven. when  <dig>  unigene elements plus the  <dig>  'debris' produced by mira were used for peptide prediction , framedp predicted peptides for  <dig>   elements. for  <dig>   of them, there was only one peptide predicted by framedp. when peptide prediction was performed for the unigene elements produced by partigene,  <dig>   presented at least one peptide. only one peptide was predicted for  <dig>   unigene elements. therefore, unigene elements of oakcontigv <dig> presented the largest portion of non-translated sequences . unigene elements from mira analysis also presented a large portion of non-translated sequence, due to 'debris' reads. when the 'debris' were excluded for peptide prediction, both mira and partigene displayed similar patterns of distribution of predicted peptides . only  <dig> % singletons of oakcontigv <dig> and  <dig> % of 'debris' in mira, respectively, had at least one predicted peptide, while  <dig> % of the singletons in partigene presented at least one predicted protein. focusing on the contigs,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of partigene, oakcontigv <dig> and mira elements, respectively, had at least one predicted peptide. of  <dig>  predicted peptides from oakcontigv <dig>   <dig>   had n-terminal or c-terminal peptide, while the rest  was assumed to be full-length peptide with both start and stop codons identified.

blastclust, a part of blast package  <cit> , found  <dig>  peptide clusters at 70% coverage and 75% similarity for the  <dig>  oakcontigv <dig> framedp-predicted peptides, which corresponded to  <dig> % reduction in the total number of predicted peptides . even with the 100% coverage and 100% similarity,  <dig>  peptides clustered into  <dig> clusters. those peptide sequences in the same cluster showed complete identity. when we performed blastclust analysis for  <dig>  framedp-predicted peptides from mira assembly plus 'debris', there were  <dig>  clusters , in which all of the cluster members showed the same peptide sequence. at the 70% coverage and 75% similarity, the rate of unique peptide was  <dig> %  , which was smaller than that found in oakcontigv <dig> . because reduction rate was higher using mira, this analysis suggests that mira is more efficient to distinguish not only polymorphisms and substitutions but also splice variants in the assembly step. this partly explains the difference in the depth of contigs. contigs by mira had an average depth of  <dig> , while that of oakcontigv <dig> was  <dig> . the blastclust result for partigene unigene elements  showed similar trend to that of oakcontigv <dig> 

all together, the comparison of the procedures that were tested to assemble sanger and 454-reads resulted into the following conclusions: first, there was an added value  to perform a combined analysis of  <dig> and sanger reads compared to a simple mapping procedure of the  <dig> data onto a sanger unigene set, second, a seeded assembly using tgicl was found to be more efficient than a direct assembly using mira because i/ mira excluded a great number of ests from the unigene set , most  corresponding to singletons in the tgicl assembly and ii/ tgicl produced less contigs  with higher depth  and longer length .

similarity searches
similarity searches were carried out using the hybrid assembly resulting from the tgicl pipeline  that provides an approximate estimate of unique transcripts, because it discriminates alternative spliced transcripts. out of  <dig>  elements of oakcontigv <dig>  homology search against protein databases resulted into  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   elements with at least one hit against swiss-prot  <cit> , refseq_protein  <cit>  and pfam  <cit>  database, respectively at the e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  while that against nucleotide databases resulted in  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigene elements with at least one hit against refseq_rna and eight tigr gene indices  <cit> , respectively. the result of blastn against eight gene indices showed that both the number of hits and aligned length of the high-scoring segment pair  were the greatest for sequences in vvgi  and least in sgi  . this may partly reflects the phylogenetic position of quercus within the eurosids i. in total,  <dig>   of oakcontigv <dig> sequences had at least one hit in this homology search process, while the remaining sequences  were orphans, which may be considered as oak specific. however, caution should be made to consider orphan sequences as oak specific without experimental validation of such sequences in cdnas. gene ontology   <cit>  annotation assigned at least one go term for  <dig>   of oakcontigv <dig> sequences. the average number of go annotations per sequence was  <dig> , while the maximum number of annotation per sequence was  <dig>  the total number of go terms was  <dig> . when these terms were mapped onto plant specific go slim terms, the number of term converged to  <dig> terms . the most abundant go slim terms were transport, nucleotide binding, plastid, in terms of biological process, molecular function and cellular component, respectively. candidate genes of ecological or economic importance were found in oakcontigv <dig> as illustrated for bud phenology , drought stress resistance with emphasis on cuticle formation  and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis . genes relating to cell wall formation were detected based on tblastx searches against maizewall database  <cit>  . these results demonstrate the value of the est catalogue that was produced for future functional genomics studies in oaks.

to further analyse the added value of sanger reads in terms of annotation, we compared the annotation rate of  <dig> and sanger unigene elements. from the  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons containing 454-reads only,  <dig>   contigs and  <dig>   singletons did not show a single blast hit, whereas, from the  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons containing at least one sanger read, these numbers drop down to  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>   singletons. this result clearly indicates the value of sanger reads for functional annotation. therefore it can be concluded that sanger reads improve not only the assembly but also the annotation of large dataset produced by next generation technology. the fact that the lower annotation  rate of unigene elements containing 454-reads only may also suggest they contain higher rate of novel or artifactual transcripts. tedersoo et al.  <cit>  indicated that singletons from 454-reads contained higher rate of artifactual reads. further laboratory work and/or bioinformatic characterization may be needed for the validation of singletons in oakcontigv <dig> 

in silico mining of simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms 
using mreps  <cit> , we found  <dig>  ssrs  with minimum repeat of five, four, three, three and three for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-ssrs, respectively, in  <dig>  unigene elements of oakcontigv <dig>  specific information for each ssr included the unigene element id and the annotation, the repeat motif, its length and position . dinucleotide as well as trinucleotide motifs were frequent, summing up  <dig> % of the total number of microsatellites . among dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats, ag and aag motifs, respectively, were the most frequent. only  <dig> cg repeats were found. tetranucleotide , pentanucleotide  and hexanucleotide  repeats were of low abundance. the frequency of microsatellites was  <dig> % considering multiple occurrence in a same unigene element, which was close to that calculated by durand et al.  <cit>  for  <dig>  sanger unigene elements in oak . when we screened microsatellites within eight tigr gene indices  <cit>  used in the similarity search  with the same method , the most frequent motif was tri-ssrs , which confirmed the general trend in ssr frequency for plant ests  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that definition of microsatellite and detection algorithm have great impact on number of detected microsatellite in silico  <cit> . when the distribution of ssr motif was visualized by som , oakcontigv <dig> located near pplgi  , which may again reflect the phylogenetic position of oaks in the eurosid i. when ssr locations  were estimated by combining results from estscan  <cit>  and mreps as in durand et al.  <cit> , the location for  <dig>   ssrs was estimated and the same trends were found . in brief, tri-ssrs were the most frequently found in coding regions , while di-ssrs were frequent  in non-coding regions. because of functional constraints of peptides, tri-ssrs with no frame shift mutations are preferable for coding regions  <cit> . as discussed in  <cit> , di-ssrs in non-coding regions were more frequently found in 5' utrs of plant transcripts  <cit> , suggesting that they may be involved in gene expression regulation.

the minimum repeat number of five, four, three, three and three for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-microsatellites, respectively, was applied.

snp detection was carried out on a subset of the  <dig>  contigs. we first took into account the presence of duplicated reads in order to avoid false snp detection  <cit> , i.e. a single representative was kept for the analysis. then, putative snps were screened for contigs with a coverage depth of more than six sequences. if the less frequent allele count was more than two and 100% identical for four bases before and after the polymorphic site, we considered this site as a putative snp. the putative snps were identified among  <dig>   contigs, resulting in  <dig>  sites and an average of  <dig> snp every  <dig> bp in contigs with putative snps. average and maximum number of snps detected in a contig was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. transition type snps  were relatively frequent and amounted to  <dig> % . within framedp-predicted peptides, there were  <dig>  snps, which resulted in  <dig>   snps in coding regions, including  <dig>   and  <dig>  , synonymous and non-synonymous snps, respectively. snp density in oak was lower compared to that found in eucalyptus grandis transcriptomes  based on  <dig> individuals using gs reference mapper   <cit> . if we apply the same criteria to calculate snp frequency to that of the eucalyptus study , the frequency remained identical , though we used more than  <dig> individuals for the sequencing step. in a de novo assembly of a coral larval transcriptome with  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing  <cit> , snps were screened by qualitysnp program and  <dig>  snps were identified resulting in  <dig> snp per  <dig> bp. the oak snp frequency was still lower, probably due to more stringent criteria used for snp detection. using information from the predicted peptides by framedp  and clustering by blastclust , a set of  <dig>  snps, including  <dig>  and  <dig>  potential coding and non-coding snps, respectively, was selected. we also found  <dig> snps relating to chloroplast  and mitochondrial  sequences. after these snps were eliminated,  <dig>  genomic snps were retained for future genetic study. this snp data set has also been made available for downloading at the quercus portal https://w <dig> pierroton.inra.fr:8443/quercusportal/home.jsf.

peptides were predicted by framedp, which often produces multiple peptide for a single unigene elements. because location of snp sites  were estimated for each predicted peptide, the sum of coding and non-coding snps exceeded the total number  of snps. tri-nucleotides are polymorphic sites with three alleles.

gene diversity was calculated for  <dig> and  <dig>  snp sites within q. robur and q. petraea, respectively . the averages were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for q. robur and q. petraea, respectively. these values were comparable to those calculated from marker-based analysis for cryptomeria japonica   <cit>  and eucalyptus grandis and e. smithii   <cit> .

detection of orthologous and paralogous gene pairs between oak and the eudicotyledons sequenced reference genomes
recently, salse et al.  <cit>  published an original and robust method for the identification of orthologous regions between plant genomes as well as for the detection of duplications within genomes based on integrative sequence alignment criteria combined with a statistical validation. this approach was applied to identify  <dig> paleo-duplications in monocots and eudicots and to propose a common ancestor with  <dig> and  <dig> chromosomes for the monocots and eudicots respectively  <cit> . in the current study, we used the  <dig>  unigene set resulting from the partigene assembly and framedp analysis to integrate the oak transcriptome information into previous paleo-genomics analysis in order to unravel the oak evolutionary paleo-history.

using the alignment parameters and statistic tests previously described by salse et al.  <cit> , we analysed the orthologous relationships between oak, arabidopsis , poplar , grape  and soybean  genomes. based on the  <dig>  oak unigene elements, we identified  <dig>  orthologous gene pairs between oak and arabidopsis , poplar , grape  and soybean  genomes. the ks distribution analysis  performed between the  <dig>  orthologous gene pairs establishes that oak is most closely related at the sequence level to grape  than any other eudicot genome included in the analysis. we then produced a heterologous oak gene map based on the precise identification of oak orthologs on the  <dig> grape chromosomes . this  <dig>  robust orthologs identified between oak and grape can be considered as a valuable source of cos  markers for further comparative genomics and genetics analysis  <cit> .

we applied the most robust and direct approach allowing the characterization of genome duplications that consists of aligning the available unigene set  on itself using stringent alignment criteria and statistical validation described in salse et al.  <cit> . the ks distribution analysis  obtained for  <dig>   of the  <dig>  paralogous gene pairs available  when compared to that obtained for arabidopsis , poplar , grape , and soybean  genomes clearly established that the actual oak genome went through at least two rounds or series of whole genome duplications , such as ancestral  shared by the eudicots and more recent .

CONCLUSIONS
we collected about  <dig> k sanger and  <dig> m 454-ests for two oak species: q. petraea and q. robur. seeded assembly by tgicl software produced  <dig>  unigene elements . on the one hand, the 454-pyrosequencing data contributed to greatly increased the number of unigene elements compared to that obtained by assembling sanger reads only . on the other hand, sanger reads significantly improved the quality of the assembly both in terms of clustering and annotation

based on similarity searches, we identified candidate genes for traits of ecological importance as well as comparative orthologous sequences  which were mapped onto vitis  chromosomes. these coss may be considered as a valuable source of genetic markers for comparative genomic analysis. evolutionary analysis also showed that grape was the closest to oak within the eudicots. additional data mining within oakcontigv <dig> identified  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig>  putative snps that can be used as functional markers in future studies. these resources are publically available from the oak contig browser at http://genotoul-contigbrowser.toulouse.inra.fr:9092/quercus_robur/index.html .

this large collection of expressed sequence tags provide an important resource for the scientific community that is interested in the molecular genetics and functional genomics of oaks. it is a fundamental resource for analysis of gene expression, discovery of genes of ecological interest, comparative mapping, and annotation of the forthcoming oak genome sequence.
