BACKGROUND
the mature cerebral cortex of higher mammals consists of a six-layered structure with each layer comprising different types of neurons that perform distinct functions. the layered structure is created during development by migration of young post-mitotic neurons along glial fibers from the proliferative zones lining the ventricles to the outer layers of the developing cortical plate . the post-mitotic neurons follow an ordered inside-out pattern of migration were young neurons migrate past their predecessors to their correct position in more superficial layers of the cp  <cit> . proper cortical layering calls for highly synchronized processes of neuronal genesis, migration and maturation. the mechanisms controlling the whole-cell movement are well understood, but knowledge of how the neurons are instructed to leave their glial guidance upon reaching their destination remains unclear.

genetic studies of human malformation and mutant mice with deficient neuronal migration have played an integral role in unveiling the existence of signalling pathways that regulate neuronal migration and neuronal detachment from the glial fibers  <cit> . the reelin pathway is one of the most intensively studied pathways involved in neuronal migration. mutations in the reelin gene is associated with neuroanatomic abnormalities in reeler mice  <cit>  and causes recessive lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia in humans  <cit> . the reeler phenotype is characterized by disordered cellular positioning of neurons in the major laminated structures of the brain, including the cerebral and cerebellar cortices and hippocampus  <cit> . the post-mitotic neurons derived from the radial progenitors in the subventricular zone begin their migration at the normal developmental stage and proceed as far as the intermediate zone. the newborn neurons, however, fail to split the preplate and the subsequently generated neurons accumulate underneath the previously generated neurons, forming a scattered neuron distribution with an approximately inverted cortical plate   <cit> .

reelin is a large extracellular glycoprotein known to influence migrating neurons as an initiator of a pathway that mediates a signal from the extracellular matrix. the signal transduction is accomplished through direct binding to the ectodomains of the lipoprotein receptors very low density lipoprotein receptor  and apolipoprotein receptor  <dig>   <cit>  upon binding to the receptors a rapid phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic adapter protein disabled- <dig>  is induced by members of the src family tyrosine kinases  <cit> . dab <dig> phosphorylation is succeeded by cytoskeletal rearrangements  <cit> . cytoskeletal rearrangements are accomplished through direct interactions between phosphorylated dab <dig> and a variety of proteins involved in actin remodeling such as neuronal wiskott-aldrich syndrome protein and rap-gtp and lissencephaly- <dig>  nuclear distribution gene e homolog like  <dig>  tau, and microtubule-associated protein 1b in microtubule reorganization  <cit> . mutations in mouse reelin, apoer <dig> and vldlr  or dab <dig> result in highly similar phenotypes with the inability of neurons to split the preplate and inability of glial-guided neurons to bypass their predecessors  <cit> . the mechanism by which the reelin pathway facilitates correct neuronal positioning remains unclear although reelin has been suggested to control detachment of migrating neurons from radial-glial cells  <cit> . recent data indicate that another function of reelin could be to activate notch  <cit> . interaction between phosphorylated dab <dig> and the activated form of notch  inhibits polyubiquitination and degradation of nicd, which is expected to strengthen notch signaling  <cit> .

expression analysis of reelin during development has been studied in a wide range of animals spanning from reptiles over birds to mammals including mice and human  <cit> . these studies indicate that the reelin-expressing cells are conserved through evolution and reelin has played a critical role in cortical evolution. in mammals, reelin has the highest expression in cajal-retzius  cells during neocortical development  <cit> . cr cells appear early in development and constitute the majority of the neurons in the marginal zone   <cit>  but they are transient neurons and disappear between postnatal week  <dig> and  <dig> in rodents and around gestational week  <dig> in humans  <cit> . in humans, cr cells have characteristic morphological appearance with a rich axonal arborization orientated horizontally  <cit> . in rodents, cr cells have a more uniform morphology and can be identified based on three morphologic criteria: 1) usually bipolar with 2) horizontal orientation and 3) fusiform or ovoid shape  <cit> . in pigs, cr cells resemble other mammalian cr with respect to localization in the outer part of mz, orientation parallel to the pial surface, and bipolar and fusiform somata  <cit> .

the domestic pig has emerged as an attractive non-primate animal model for studies of brain development, due to the similarity between human and pig embryonic brains  <cit> . the gyrencephalic pig brain bears resemblance to the human brain with respect to gross anatomy, cytoarchitecture, size and development rather than to the brains from small rodent laboratory animals  <cit> . in this study we have identified and characterized pig reelin and determined the expression pattern of reelin during embryonic cortical development in this species.

RESULTS
sequence of the pig reelin mrna and protein
as a first step towards characterization of pig reelin we determined the sequence of mrna and protein. as the pig genome sequence is not available, the reelin mrna sequence was assembled from combined in silico and rt-pcr analysis. a  <dig>  bp mrna sequence was determined including an open reading frame from position  <dig> to  <dig>  with potential to encode a protein consisting of  <dig> amino acids . the deduced molecular weight of the pig reelin protein is  <dig> kd, not taking into account post translational modifications such as glycosylation. protein alignment to human reelin showed 96% identity and 98% similarity. notably, no gaps were introduced in the alignment of the pig and human reelin proteins. protein alignment to mouse reelin showed 94% identity and 98% similarity with two gaps. like the human and mouse reelin proteins the pig reelin includes  <dig> reelin-repeats of 350- <dig> amino acids containing a pattern of conserved residues related to epidermal growth factor  repeats . the reelin repeats can be divided into two sub-repeats a and b   <cit> . the c-terminal region  of reelin, consisting of  <dig> amino acids, is highly conserved between species, and the pig reelin indeed includes such a completely conserved ctr. another characteristic of reelin is the existence of a  <dig> amino acid signal peptide in the n-terminus. protein alignment of the n-terminal region showed a more pronounced similarity between human and pig reelin than between mouse and pig reelin . whether this difference in conservation has biological implications needs further investigation.

the human and mouse reelin genes consist of  <dig> exons and our analysis indicates a conserved genomic structure of the pig reelin gene . evolutionary conserved alternative splicing of a brain specific reelin gene miniexon, exon  <dig>  has been described  <cit> . human and mouse reelin gene exon  <dig> consists of  <dig> nt. the above described pig reelin mrna includes a  <dig> nt exon  <dig> and according to the nomenclature of human and mouse reelin the corresponding pig mrna is abbreviated isoform a. to determine if reelin isoform b, which lacks exon  <dig> in the mrna sequence, also existed in the pig we performed a rt-pcr analysis. two different forward primers were designed which could distinguish the inclusion of exon  <dig> and the primers were used in rt-pcr together with a reverse primer in exon  <dig> . as template was used pig embryonic cortical cdna. by this approach we could detect the existence of reelin isoform b . using cortical cdna representing different developmental points we observed parallel expression profiles for the two reelin isoforms in accordance with observations from other mammalian species  <cit> . using a rt-pcr primer combination from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> followed by sequencing we estimated that pig reelin isoform b was expressed at a lower level than isoform a, also in accordance with data from other mammalians   <cit> . in summary, pig reelin mrna and protein show highly conserved properties compared to other mammalian species.

expression of pig reelin cdna and protein in the developing cortex
we studied the expression pattern of reelin protein during pig brain development by western blot analysis. a reelin protein band was clearly visible at the early stage, e <dig>  which corresponds to the phase of preplate formation in the pig . the clone  <dig> antibody detects the full-length protein band in the 5% gel  in the lanes containing cortical extracts from e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  the presence of this band is restricted to this time interval. the other bands recognized in the 5% gel correspond to length of around  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda, which are the dominant bands in extract from brain tissue  <cit> .

in 4-15% gradient gels no clear full length band was detected. it may be trapped in the slot due to high contend of polyacrylamid fibers. the  <dig> kda band appeared between e <dig> and e <dig> while two strong bands of about  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda in length were consistently present except for the  <dig> kda band at e <dig>  the low molecular band of  <dig> kda has been observed in extracts from brain tissue as far back in phylogeny as sea lamprey using both clones  <dig> and g <dig> reelin antibodies. it has been suggested to represent a proteolytic fragment  <cit> , but there is no identified proteolytic site in the n-terminal region of reelin recognized by the antibodies that could account for the size of  <dig> kda corresponding to, approximately, 650aa.

interestingly, a band of ~ <dig> kda was detected at very low intensity at e <dig>  growing in intensity to peak in e <dig> and then decreasing . this band has not previously been described in any animal. the intensity variation does to some extend follow the bell-shaped-like variation in rna expression of the reelin gene during this embryonic period . when comparing the intensities of the other bands in the gel the ~ <dig> kda band does not appear to be a proteolytic product of either the  <dig> kda or  <dig> kda bands. an alternative explanation could be a new splice variant found in the porcine brain. western blotting experiments performed on mouse brain tissue spanning the period from embryonic day  <dig> to postnatal day  <dig> did not reveal this band . a functional implication of the ~ <dig> kda band is difficult to predict since jossin et al. showed that a protein fragment consisting of the repeats  <dig> to  <dig> is necessary and sufficient for binding to the lipoprotein receptors and subsequent phosphorylation of dab <dig>  <cit> .

the reelin expression gradually increased to reach a peak of expression at e <dig>  corresponding to a period of intense neuronal migration form the proliferative layers into the cortical plate . the reelin expression slightly decreased through the late developmental stages .

mrna expression levels were analyzed by qrt-pcr and the resulting pattern was consistent with the observations from reelin immunoblots . mrna was initially detected at very low levels at e <dig> . this stage corresponds to an early stage in preplate formation. the mrna levels increased from e <dig> through e <dig> and e <dig> to a peak at e <dig>  this increase was followed by a decline in expression to a plateau level from e <dig> to e <dig> followed by a further decrease to e <dig> .

immunohistochemical examination of pig reelin expression in the developing cortex
immunohistochemical staining for reelin at e <dig>  showed no staining of any cell type . at e <dig>  reelin positive cells were seen in the outer part of the mz  and a few small round immunoreactive cells were identified in layers iii-v of the cortical plate  . these cells were identified as interneurons in a variety of mammals  <cit> . for the most part, the antibody against reelin stained the cytoplasm of the cells and immunoreactive dendrites and axons were rarely observed. the reelin expressing neurons located in the outer part of the mz displayed a different morphology. the main part of the neurons were elongated with the axis oriented parallel to the pial surface, resemble cr cells , others were small round interneurons  and neurons oriented perpendicular to the pial surface could be indentified in the inner part of the mz. at later stages e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> , the immunoreactive cells decreased in number. a few bipolar and fusiform cr type cells restricted to the outer part of the mz could be identified  along with a decreasing number of reelin positive interneurons in the cp at e <dig>  these neurons were not detectable at later embryonic stages.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we describe the identification and characterization of pig reelin cdna and protein. the reelin protein shows a high degree of homology to the human reelin. the expression profile of pig reelin during cortical development resembles human reelin. in accordance with the mrna expression level the reelin protein expression is initiated at early developmental stages and increases during corticogenesis. the same expression patterns are reported in human and the mouse embryonic brain tissue  <cit> . immunohistochemical analysis of reelin expression also shows localization within cr cells of the mz of the developing cortex similar to human reelin. the reelin characterization described here support the potential for establishing the pig as a model for human neuronal migration disorders.
