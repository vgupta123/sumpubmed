BACKGROUND
laccases  are a major group of ligninolytic enzymes which are present in all the eukaryotic kingdoms described in the five kingdom classification by r.h whittaker in  <dig> . laccases non-specifically catalyse one-electron oxidation of four equivalent substrates concomitant with the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water with the help of a copper containing catalytic apparatus  <cit> . physiologically, laccase fulfil diverse roles from plant lignin polymerisation  <cit>  to fungal morphogenesis  <cit> . being less substrate specific, energy-saving, and biodegradable, laccases were suitable in the development of highly effective, sustainable, and eco-friendly enterprises  <cit>  in the areas of biofuel production  <cit> , chemical transformation of xenobiotics  <cit> , dye decolourisation  <cit> , as biofuel cells  <cit> , effluent treatment  <cit> , pulp bleaching  <cit> , as biosensors  <cit>  and in general food quality improvement  <cit> . any application of laccase requires large scale production of the enzyme preferably in a cost effective manner.

even though other enzyme production systems prefer submerged fermentation, enzyme production from fungi, especially filamentous fungi is better adapted to solid state fermentation  as only ssf offers an adherence surface to filamentous fungi  <cit> . in ssf, growth and enzyme production occur in inert or natural solid material under near or complete absence of free flowing liquid. ssf have advantages like high volumetric productivity  <cit> , effective utilization of agro industrial wastes as substrates that even mimic the natural living surface of fungi and economy  <cit>  due to its static nature. ssf utilizes materials like orange peel  <cit> , banana waste  <cit> , barley bran  <cit>  and pine apple leaves  <cit>  for useful enzyme production, which otherwise pose solid waste disposal problems. this reutilization is appreciated in the context of sustainable development. however, robust control of parameters  in ssf is difficult particularly on an industrial scale, which explains the failure of adapting successful lab scale production systems to an industrial level in the past  <cit> . this can be overcome by the thorough optimization of the different factors that influence production. classical single factor method of optimization is an inadequate choice as it is time consuming  <cit>  and will not yield any outcome regarding the relative influence of any of the involving factors. statistical methods which also accounts for variations in the production process would be appropriate for optimization. taguchi method of design of experiment is an approach for optimization of parameters, where the production quality stands intact even in an altered environment  <cit> .

the taguchi method of design of experiments  was developed by genechi taguchi who was involved in modifying the japanese telephone system  <cit> . the main aim of this method is to determine the optimal process characteristic that is weakly sensitive to noise factors  <cit> . the taguchi method operates systematically with fewer trials, thus reducing the time, cost and effort, but offer more quantitative information  <cit> . the method can work even if the parameters are discrete and qualitative. it functions by reducing the sensitivity of the system  <cit>  through thorough parameter designing. for the purpose, taguchi employs a fractional factorial design in the form of an orthogonal array. this array includes representatives from all possible combinations of selected experimental parameters, which are apt to increase the efficiency and precision and simultaneously reducing any experimental errors  <cit> . analysis of individual factor contribution along with their interactive effects eventually leads to the identification of finest factors which was further optimized through analysis of variance . all these advantages contribute to its greater application in other fields of science especially biotechnology.

a newly isolated strain la <dig> from rarely explored species palmivorus, is the laccase producing fungus that is selected in the present study. the strain was found to be utilizing pineapple leaves, an inexpensive, unused agro-residue, as substrate for laccase production. the initial laccase activity expressed by marasmiellus palmivorus la <dig> was as good as or even higher than that of the initial activities of some of the other reported fungi . the present study applies taguchi method for the optimization of extracellular laccase enzyme production in ssf from the fungi marasmiellus palmivorus la <dig>  the experimental design comprises of seven different factors that proceeds at two levels with l <dig>  array layout for laccase production. this is the first attempt reported for the optimization of laccase production from any marasmiellus palmivorus, which is generally viewed only in the context of palm pathogens.

RESULTS
determination of factors
selection of the appropriate culture factors is the prime key for the success of any optimization process. here the factors and levels selected were based on the preliminary studies of one factor at a time  on laccase production by marasmiellus palmivorus la <dig>  the selected factors do have an influential role in laccase production as it increases the laccase production from  <dig>  to  <dig>  iu/ml, which is  <dig>  fold during ofat. previous studies on different fungal laccases also emphasise the requirement of temperature, ph  <cit> , galactose  <cit> , cupric sulphate  <cit> , inoculum concentration  <cit> , and substrate length  <cit>  for increased laccase production. however, in ofat only the individual factor contributions are taken into consideration, which may vary during factor interactions in an industrial scale scenario.

designing of the matrix experiment
taguchi method of doe is an effective statistical plan for studying the optimization of laccase production involving several factors. it is reliable for parameter identification with the added advantage of sparing the cost. implementation of taguchi through qualitek- <dig>  windows version can be through any of the l- <dig> arrays with three factors at two levels to l- <dig> arrays with  <dig> factors at three levels. in the present study, the l- <dig> array was designed using qualitek- <dig> applied in order to study seven different factors. in this orthogonal array, the control factors and the identified noise factors were varied in such a way to find out a combination where variations in noise no longer affect the overall production  <cit> . these were called the robust designs and the analysis is called the signal to noise ratio analysis. the signal to noise ratio is linked with quadratic loss function, which in turn assumes significant losses can happen within the specification limit  <cit> . such losses within limits are expected and can easily be met. “bigger is better” quality characteristic provides a single index for the measurable results from multiple criteria.

experimentation of the designed matrix
all the  <dig> trials were carried out under ssf. on experimenting the matrix combination, trial  <dig>  which comprises of temperature - 28 °c, ph -  <dig>  ammonium dihydrogen phosphate - <dig> % , galactose -  <dig> % , cupric sulphate – 3 mm, inoculum concentration  -  <dig> nos. and substrate length -  <dig>  m yielded maximum production with 659 ± 12 iu/ml, while least production is for the trial  <dig>  trial  <dig> includes temperature - 26 °c, ph -  <dig>  ammonium dihydrogen phosphate -  <dig> % , galactose -  <dig> % , cupric sulphate – 1 mm, inoculum concentration  -  <dig> nos. and substrate length -  <dig>  m .table  <dig> experimental trial results of all the eight trials conducted




data analysis
the average of obtained enzyme production, in which each factor is at given level, is described in table  <dig>  difference between the average values, l2-l <dig> indicated the relative influence of the particular factor. greater the difference in values, better the influence on production. the positive value indicates an increase in production as it moves from level  <dig> to level  <dig>  while the negative value indicates production decrease during the course from l <dig> to l <dig>  thus among the selected factors, cupric sulphate increases the laccase production at level  <dig>  followed by substrate length, inoculum concentration, ph, temperature, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and galactose. ammonium dihydrogen phosphate has very less or no effect on laccase production with very similar values at level  <dig>  and level  <dig> . galactose on the other hand is showing a slight better production at level  <dig> table  <dig> main effects of all the selected factors

individual factor interaction
interaction analysis provides insight into the interaction of a factor with other factors considered during the experiment. the severity index  represents the influence of two individual factors at different levels of interaction. col. in table  <dig> show the position to which interacting factors are allotted. overall influences of the selected factors on laccase production were depicted graphically . a perpendicular line represents full  interaction while parallel line means no interaction between the given factors. on analysing the severity index, its noteworthy that ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, the least laccase production influencer interacts maximally with inoculum concentration to give higher severity index , while the high enzyme production influencing cupric sulphate shows modest interaction with inoculum concentration with low si .table  <dig> predicted interactions of the given factors depicted via severity index

individual factor contribution and anova
analysis of variance test was carried out to determine the significance of individual factors on total laccase production . test results showed that cupric sulphate has a significant impact  on laccase production followed by substrate length . the other factors cumulatively contribute about  <dig> % only to laccase production. from the f-ratio of all selected parameters, it was noticed that ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate has null effect on production thus its effect was pooled. pooling also helps to avoid saturation of the designed system. all other factors and their interactions considered in the current design were statistically significant at 90% confidence interval indicating that their variability can be explained in terms of significant effects. contribution of each factor on laccase enzyme production was represented in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> analysis of variance

optimum level determination and validation of the optimum
the taguchi method provided optimum culture conditions for each of the influencing factor. the optimum conditions estimated and their contribution are shown in table  <dig>  cupric sulphate and substrate length were the major factors affecting laccase production from marasmiellus palmivorus la <dig> under solid state fermentation. signal to noise ratio expected was  <dig>  , from which the expected production was calculated using the formula, square root ). msd represents all the variation around the given target and can be calculated from s/n, where s/n = - log . the expected laccase production at optimum conditions was found to be  <dig>  iu/ml.table  <dig> optimum culture condition predicted and their contributions on the selected levels




variation reduction plot
variation reduction plot is a graphical representation of the current and improved production status within upper and lower control limits  . nominal value is  <dig>  iu/ml while lcl and ucl being  <dig>  and  <dig>  iu/ml respectively. reduced variation is represented by the steep peak in graph. from the graph it’s deducted that the improved condition could cause a savings of  <dig> %. this savings owes to the elimination of non necessitated media component.fig.  <dig> variation reduction plot based on current and new, improved conditions. normal performance distribution profiles for laccase activity with higher improved frequency




validation of the optimum
tests were performed with the optimized factors with the recommended level. this resulted in the production of  <dig>  ± 13 iu/ml of enzyme which is comparable to the predicted . thus the taguchi method is validated for extracellular laccase production.

fungal laccase production under solid state fermentation is influenced by various environmental  and cultural  conditions  <cit> . involvement of many factors leads to optimization to improve the laccase enzyme production. other than classical approaches, taguchi method of doe offers a statistical design to create robustness in the process with low lost by considering only the main effects. the method also accounts multiple interaction possibilities between the parameters which is significant in industrial applications. unlike the past decade, many works were currently relying on taguchi methods for culture parameter optimization  <cit> , process optimization  <cit> , medium optimization  <cit>  and overall yield of enzyme production  <cit> . in this optimization process the most influencing factors affecting laccase production were found to be cupric sulphate, followed by substrate length and inoculum concentration. increased production in the presence of copper can be attributed as the defensive response of fungi towards the induced metallic stress  <cit> . similar increase in laccase production was observed in marasmius quercophilus in addition of copper  <cit> . copper can induce the production of laccase isozymes which leads to increased production  <cit> . influence of the pine apple leaf length in production is by offering more surface area and lignin for the basidiomycete, marasmiellus palmivorus la <dig> growth and laccase production  <cit> . inoculum size does play an important role in establishing the culture in erlenmeyer flasks, which explains its influential role. the insignificance of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate in the medium was stated through the statistical study, which leads to the elimination of the same from medium, thus reducing the cost without compromising the production quality and quantity. the strain provides a satisfactory yield of laccase  leading to the application of the enzyme directly or in immobilized form in industrial settings.table  <dig> comparison of laccase yields of other fungi with the fungus of interest, grown under solid state fermentation

CONCLUSIONS
