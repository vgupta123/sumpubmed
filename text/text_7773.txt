BACKGROUND
photosynthesis provides plant cells with assimilates, reducing power and atp. to coordinate their supply and demand, plants respond to environmental changes on time scales ranging from milliseconds to days. in addition to biochemical regulation of enzyme activities, control of gene expression is essential for long-term adjustment of metabolic capacities. however, the photosynthetic electron transport chain and chloroplast metabolism have evolved as patchworks composed of nuclear and plastid-encoded proteins and depend on coordination of gene expression between compartments. in recent years, physiological and mutant approaches addressed the regulatory function of metabolite signals  <cit> , energy status  <cit>  and chloroplast redox signals  <cit> . for example, carbohydrates induce expression of genes involved in starch biosynthesis and suppress those involved in starch degradation and carbon assimilation  <cit> . in parallel, in the plastids, expression of e.g. core subunits of the photoreaction centres and the large subunit of rubisco are suppressed either by co-regulation of transcription or epistatically. photosynthates further inhibit the calvin-cycle biochemically  <cit>  and decrease the consumption of nadph and atp, which results in an increased reduction state of the nad-system and a higher phosphorylation state of adenylates  <cit> . the lack of nadp+ as electron acceptor and the generation of a high trans-thylakoid Δph by decreased photophosphorylation reduce the carriers of intersystem electron transport, like plastoquinone pool , and stimulate ros formation  <cit> . pqh <dig> and ros are redox signals controlling nuclear and plastid gene expression  <cit> . the combination of decreased nadp+ regeneration and high thylakoid acidification promotes the violaxanthin cycle, which can support biosynthesis of the plant hormone abscisic acid  <cit>  if ascorbate availability is limiting  <cit> .

the plant signalling networks evolved in the context of a strong interference of photosynthates and redox and energy signals. therefore, in wt distinction of particular signals is often difficult. here, for differentiation, gene expression regulation was analyzed in wt, in the thylakoid acidification mutant pgr <dig>  <cit> , in the starch-biosynthetic mutant adg <dig>  <cit>  and in the ascorbate-deficient mutant vtc <dig>  <cit>  in response to the co <dig> availability.

pgr <dig> is mutated in the rieske subunit of the cytochrome b6f complex  that is involved in electron and proton transfer processes between photosystem ii and i as a plastohydroquinol-plastocyanin reductase. due to a shift in the pk or the redox potential of the rieske protein, thylakoid lumen acidification is restricted in the mutant to ph  <dig> even in high light  <cit> . consequently, the mutant has altered capacities for adp photophosphorylation  <cit>  and psbs protonation  <cit> , and may be limited in violaxanthin de-epoxidation  <cit>  and cyclic electron transport  <cit> . in pgr <dig>  high light intensities increase the electron pressure to the pq pool and release the electron pressure downstream of the cytb6f complex. pgr <dig> was selected in this communication for its limitation in membrane energization and photosynthetic electron transport.

adg <dig> carries a mutation in the small subunit of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase  <cit> . it was selected for its altered carbohydrate metabolism. in contrast to pgr <dig>  in adg <dig> photosynthetic electron transport is affected only indirectly by carbohydrate-induced feedback inhibition  <cit> .

the third selected mutant, vtc <dig>  carries a point mutation in gdp-mannose pyrophosphorylase  <cit> , which catalyzes precursor formation in the biosynthesis of the low-molecular weight antioxidant ascorbate. vtc <dig> was included in this analysis to investigate the importance of ascorbate availability and ascorbate-related redox processes on nuclear and plastid gene expression.

arabidopsis wt and the mutants were compared under conditions of limiting, ambient and saturating co <dig> concentrations. below the co <dig> compensation point, rubisco preferentially catalyzes oxygenation of ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate and activates photorespiration, which triggers an extra demand for atp. per reaction cycle, chloroplastic nadph consumption is low under photorespiratory as compared to assimilatory conditions. in addition, at very low co <dig> concentrations, depletion of the carbohydrate pool may suppress photorespiration and limit photoprotection. concomitantly, the ros load increases due to high peroxisomal h2o <dig> production and chloroplast superoxide generation. at ambient conditions,  <dig> – 40% of the carbon fluxes diverts to photorespiratory co <dig> release, while saturating co <dig> suppresses photorespiration and the requirement for atp to nadph approaches a ratio of 3: <dig>  in parallel, energization and reduction state of the cells are decreased  <cit> .

the hypothesis of the work was that the combination of working with defined mutants and altering co <dig> availability for modulation of photosynthesis allows addressing the question of how selected nuclear and plastidic genes are regulated in arabidopsis in response to redox, metabolite and energy signals.

RESULTS
the work aimed at differentiating signals involved in the control of gene expression. to this end arabidopsis wt and mutants defective in chloroplast starch biosynthesis , thylakoid acidification  and the biosynthesis of the major low-molecular-weight antioxidant ascorbate  were compared in relation to their metabolite patterns, photosynthetic performance and transcript amount regulation. following growth at ambient conditions, the co <dig> availability was decreased for  <dig> h to levels below the co <dig> compensation point or increased to saturation of rubisco to establish contrasting conditions for photosynthesis with high and low acceptor availability and concomitant high and low reduction pressure.

metabolic regulation
the energy status
in wt during the  <dig> h fumigation period the adp content increased  <dig> -2-fold irrespective of the treatment . in parallel, the atp accumulated only in  <dig> ppm co <dig>  but decreased in  <dig> and  <dig> ppm co <dig>  the atp/adp ratio was nearly unchanged around  <dig> in  <dig> ppm, but decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in  <dig> and  <dig> ppm co <dig> . mutant metabolism resulted in specific modifications of the wt-pattern:

in adg <dig>  atp and adp accumulated  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in  <dig> ppm co <dig> and  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in  <dig> ppm co <dig> indicating an increase in the total adenylate concentration, but a decrease in the atp/adp ratio. in  <dig> ppm co <dig> the atp content increased insignificantly, while the adp content decreased resulting in an atp/adp ratio similar to the initial values obtained before the treatment .

the atp content of vtc <dig> slightly but steadily decreased with increasing co <dig> availability, while the adp content increased from the lowest levels observed prior to the fumigation experiment  <dig> -fold in  <dig> ppm co <dig>   <dig> -fold in  <dig> ppm co <dig> and  <dig> -fold in  <dig> ppm co <dig> . the high atp and especially the low adp contents after  <dig> h resulted in a strong decrease in the atp/adp-ratio from  <dig>  to around  <dig> .

pgr <dig> is limited in thylakoid acidification  <cit> . like in vtc <dig>  the atp/adp ratio decreased to values around two during the experiment independent of the co <dig> concentration applied . however, the relative decrease was much less in pgr <dig> due to an already much lower initial atp/adp ratio . in addition to the generally low atp/adp ratio, the total adenylate concentration was also low in pgr <dig> suggesting coupling between adenylate biosynthesis and adp-phosphorylation efficiency. the adp contents were similar to that in wt and did not increase in  <dig> ppm like in vtc <dig> and adg <dig> , while the atp content slightly decreased demonstrating a mutation-specific difference in regulation of the adenylate concentration in parallel to the atp/adp ratio .

assimilatory force and the reduction state of the nadp system
the assimilatory force fa, i.e. the product of the phosphorylation potential /  and the ratio of /, was calculated from the dhap/3-pga ratio  as introduced in  <cit> . fa indicates the energization of metabolism by photosynthetic light reactions as compared to the consumptive demand. the relationship was originally defined for chloroplasts. due to energy and metabolite coupling it also tentatively describes the energy status of leaves  <cit> . fa was increased in wt and all mutants during  <dig> h in co2-free air compared to the values at onset of fumigation   indicating a high reduction state of the nadp-system  . at high co <dig>  the /calc ratios of the mutants were little increased in wt , adg <dig>  and pgr <dig> , but elevated in vtc <dig>  compared to the values at onset of fumigation . the calculated reduction states of nadp at high co <dig> were increased in wt , adg <dig>  and pgr <dig> , but hardly changed in vtc <dig>  relative to ambient conditions .

the strong decline in the 3-pga content in co2-free air indicated an increased assimilatory force in low co <dig> . 3-pga contents slightly increased in  <dig> ppm co <dig> during the  <dig> h of treatment, remained unchanged in wt in  <dig> ppm co <dig> and decreased in the mutants.

antioxidant protection
antioxidant enzymes and low molecular weight redox metabolites constitute the antioxidant defence system of the plants. modifications of antioxidant enzyme activities often reflect general changes in the redox status and in ros generation of the tissue, or compensatory responses to specific redox changes  <cit> .

ascorbate contents and redox states
at the beginning of the fumigation period, the ascorbate content was lowest in vtc <dig> with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol asc/g fw reflecting the mutational defect in ascorbate biosynthesis  <cit>  . the highest ascorbate levels were observed in wt, and intermediate contents in adg <dig> and pgr <dig>  in wt the ascorbate content increased approximately  <dig> -fold in ambient air, but hardly changed in low and high co <dig>  in adg <dig>  starting with a lower content than wt, ascorbate levels increased to high values at  <dig> ppm and were unchanged in  <dig> and  <dig> ppm co <dig>  in vtc <dig>  with its low ascorbate contents due to the mutation in one of the main ascorbate biosynthetic enzymes, ascorbate increased  <dig> -fold in co2-free air and  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in  <dig> and  <dig> ppm co <dig>  it maximally reached 50% of the wt level in  <dig> ppm co <dig>  in pgr <dig>  the ascorbate content increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmol asc/g fw in  <dig> ppm and to similar levels around  <dig> μmol asc/g fw in  <dig> ppm and  <dig> ppm co <dig>  the co <dig> availability affected the redox state of ascorbate to a minor extent. from an almost fully reduced level at the beginning of the fumigation period, the mean values after  <dig> h fumigation indicate slightly higher oxidation levels  in  <dig> ppm and  <dig> ppm co <dig> than in  <dig> ppm co <dig> .

glutathione contents and redox states
compensating the low ascorbate content, the glutathione content was highest in vtc <dig> at the beginning of the fumigation period. lowest glutathione contents were observed in adg <dig>  while the glutathione content was similar to wt in pgr <dig>  during the  <dig> h fumigation the glutathione content increased in all samples to similar levels and redox states . although not significantly different, the mean values indicate a trend towards slightly higher reduction at the end of the fumigation period .

activities of antioxidant enzymes
compared to wt, the three mutants revealed increased ascorbate peroxidase activities in high and low co <dig>  apx activity of adg <dig> was twice that observed in wt at ambient co <dig> concentrations . in parallel, the sod activity was  <dig> -fold induced in adg <dig>  like for apx the co <dig> availability scarcely affected sod activity of vtc <dig>  sod and apx activities were only slightly higher in pgr <dig> than in wt, while that mutation increased glutathione reductase activity in  <dig> and  <dig> ppm co <dig> . surprisingly, sod and gr activities were lower in  <dig> than  <dig> ppm co <dig> .

contents of soluble and hydrolysable sugars
in wt, pgr <dig> and vtc <dig> the co <dig> availability barely changed the availability of soluble sugars, while in adg <dig>  due to the limitation in chloroplast starch biosynthesis, the sugar concentration was higher in  <dig> ppm co <dig> than in wt. in parallel, hydrolysable sugars were generally very low in adg <dig> and did not increase in high co <dig>  pgr <dig> and vtc <dig> had similar and slightly higher soluble sugar levels than wt at all co <dig> concentrations applied. in contrast, the concentration of hydrolysable sugars was less in vtc <dig> compared to pgr <dig>  which may reflect the effect of limited gdp-mannose pyrophosphorylase activity on cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . generally, in wt, vtc <dig> and pgr <dig> the sugar levels were only elevated at ambient co <dig>  but not in saturating co <dig> demonstrating that in high co <dig>  in which calvin-cycle activity should be stimulated, carbon assimilation was limited or carbohydrate consumption activated leading to similar carbohydrate pool sizes as in  <dig> ppm co <dig> .

aba levels in ambient air
consistent with previous observations  <cit> , the aba content was increased  <dig> -fold in vtc <dig> compared to wt. adg <dig> and pgr <dig> showed insignificant increases in the range of  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold, respectively .

photosynthetic performance of wild-type and mutants
to test wt and mutants for limitations in photosynthetic electron transport, in the final  <dig> hours of the fumigation period the photosynthetic response of the plants to a  <dig> -increase in the light intensity from  <dig> to  <dig> μmol quanta m- <dig> s- <dig> was tested by monitoring chlorophyll-a-fluorescence parameters . in ambient air, the quantum yield of photosystem ii /fm') was similar at standard light conditions in wt, adg <dig> and vtc <dig> and slightly higher in pgr <dig>  in response to increased light, it decreased most in pgr <dig> with a steady-state level of  <dig> . in vtc <dig>  the steady-state Φpsii was highest, while in wt and adg <dig> it was slightly lower.

in  <dig> ppm, Φpsii strongly decreased in all plants prior to the increase in light intensity . in response to the 3-fold increase in light intensity Φpsii further decreased to levels between  <dig>   and  <dig>   indicating severe reduction of photosynthetic electron transport efficiency.

at  <dig> ppm co <dig> , Φpsii of all lines was highest at standard light conditions  and dropped in response to increased light to levels around  <dig>  in wt, adg <dig> and vtc <dig> and as low as  <dig>  in pgr <dig> 

transcript level regulation in response to high and low co2
semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses at least in triplicates were performed to assess the transcript regulation of selected genes in leaves  <dig> h after fumigation beginning with the respective co <dig> concentration . compared to wt, in  <dig> ppm co <dig> the transcript levels of the plastidic genes psaa and psba, which encode core subunits of photoreaction centre i and ii, respectively, and that of the nuclear encoded small subunit of rubisco were not significantly changed in the mutants adg <dig>  pgr <dig> and vtc <dig>  reflecting acclimation. the transcript level for ferritin- <dig> which has been suggested as marker gene for hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  decreased in all mutants. in contrast, transcripts for bap <dig>  which is a marker gene for singlet oxygen signalling  <cit> , were specifically increased in the ascorbate deficient mutant vtc <dig> 

the transcript levels of the three tested nuclear encoded chloroplast antioxidant enzymes csd <dig>  sapx and 2cpa showed mutant specific patterns. csd <dig> and sapx transcript levels were wt-like in vtc <dig>  increased in adg <dig> and decreased in pgr <dig>  while the 2cpa transcript levels were specifically decreased in adg <dig>  stp <dig> transcript amounts, which are suppressed by the cellular carbohydrate availability  <cit> , were doubled in pgr <dig> and increased  <dig> -fold in vtc <dig>  but were unchanged in adg <dig> 

in adg <dig> and pgr <dig>  like in wt, the transcript levels of the two plastome encoded genes psaa and psab and the nuclear encoded rbcs, stp <dig>  bap <dig> and ferritin- <dig> increased in response to  <dig> and  <dig> ppm. fig.  <dig> gives the transcript modifications in response to depleting or saturating co <dig> of wt and mutants each normalized to the respective level in  <dig> ppm. in vtc <dig>  the response of bap <dig>  which was already strongly increased at  <dig> ppm, was weakest. in  <dig> ppm co <dig> treated vtc <dig> psba transcripts were hardly increased and psaa transcripts were even slightly decreased indicating a specific response pattern of vtc <dig> to high co <dig> 

again the three transcripts for nuclear encoded chloroplast antioxidant enzymes csd <dig>  sapx and 2cpa showed specific response patterns. csd <dig> hardly responded to changes in the co2-availability. only in pgr <dig>  where the transcript levels were decreased at  <dig> ppm co <dig>  an increase in  <dig> and  <dig> ppm co <dig> was observed. sapx transcripts, which were decreased in wt arabidopsis in response to increased and also decreased co <dig> availability, strongly decreased in adg <dig> treated with  <dig> ppm co <dig> and increased in pgr <dig> at  <dig> ppm co <dig>  in vtc <dig>  the transcript level responded wt-like in  <dig> ppm co <dig> and atypically increased in  <dig> ppm co <dig>  2cpa transcripts showed the previously reported co <dig> dependency  <cit> . the regulation amplitude increased in adg <dig>  the high co2-response was abolished in pgr <dig> and reversed to an increased transcript level in  <dig> ppm co <dig> in vtc <dig> 

discussion
photosynthetic activity and metabolism depend on the stoichiometrical assembly and regulated interaction of nuclear and chloroplast encoded proteins  <cit> . in addition, changing environmental conditions are continuously sensed and used to adjust the photosynthetic apparatus for balanced supply of energy, reductive power and assimilates. the basic mechanism of regulation involves coordination of gene expression. although various studies on this topic have identified candidate signals, the complexity of interaction and the multiplicity of signals are far from being understood. here, a set of biochemical and physiological data and the transcripts were analyzed upon variation of the co2-availability in order to tentatively identify potential signalling dependencies . approaching co <dig> saturation releases the electron pressure within the photosynthetic electron transport chain, increases the acceptor availability at psi and decreases photorespiration intensity. high quantum yields of psii  indicated efficient electron consumption. despite metabolic activation, the cellular reduction state of nadp increased in wt under saturating co <dig> . in parallel, the atp availability decreased   <cit> .

regulation of ros-responsive genes
six hours of illumination in low, ambient or high co <dig> elicited significant changes in transcript abundance. the increase of ferritin- <dig> and bap <dig> transcript amounts in  <dig> and  <dig> ppm co <dig> indicates redox imbalances and stimulation of ros signalling in high as well as low co <dig>  <cit> . this is surprising since relaxation of electron pressure should be maximal at saturating co <dig> with concomitantly low rates of ros generation. however, a high activation state of the calvin cycle needed for efficient carbon fixation at saturating co <dig> depends on a highly reduced thioredoxin system that in turn activates the redox regulated enzymes  <cit> . the increase of ferritin- <dig> and bap- <dig> transcript levels suggests that regulated electron drainage maintains sufficient electron pressure and is involved in the up-regulation of the ros-related marker genes.

the co <dig> dependent response was altered in the mutant genetic backgrounds. in adg <dig>  the bap <dig> transcript levels were less induced in  <dig> ppm and more in  <dig> ppm  demonstrating that limitations in chloroplast carbohydrate storage affect the responsiveness of singlet oxygen-signalling. it is tempting to assume that in adg <dig> increased apx and sod activities  antagonized bap <dig> induction in low co <dig>  due to higher antioxidant protection, while the high transcript accumulation in  <dig> ppm co <dig> results from carbohydrate inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport due to insufficient capacities for starch biosynthesis. transcript amount co-regulation analysis shows among all genes tested the strongest correlation of bap <dig> with the ascorbate content . consistent with the hypothesis by op den camp et al.  <cit>  that bap <dig> is regulated by singlet oxygen, the antagonistic effect of ascorbate availability and the negative correlation with the activity of antioxidant enzymes supports the conclusion that the overall cellular antioxidant capacity controls bap <dig> induction. because the total glutathione content was significantly decreased in adg <dig> in  <dig> ppm at the begin and end of the fumigation time , a special regulatory function in bap1-regulation is indicated for the ascorbate-specific components of the halliwell-asada-cycle  <cit> .

in contrast, for ferritin- <dig>  which is supposed to be induced specifically by h2o <dig>  <cit> , no such strict correlation was observed with the availability of low molecular weight antioxidants or the activity of antioxidant enzymes. highest correlation was observed with the availability of hydrolysable sugars  suggesting regulation by carbohydrate metabolism. a similar negative correlation with the contents of hydrolysable sugars was observed for stp <dig>  which encodes a plasma-membrane monosaccharide transporter  <cit> . even stronger than for ferritin- <dig> transcript abundance and bap <dig> transcript abundance, for stp <dig> a positive correlation with the glutathione content and the redox state of the glutathione pool was observed  suggesting glutathione-dependent regulation. however, excluding adg1-data from the correlation analysis demonstrated that at least for bap <dig> and stp <dig> the high correlation with glutathione data results from the adg1-specific regulation of the glutathione pool and, therefore, may also result from disturbed chloroplast carbohydrate metabolism.

ascorbate-dependent regulation
in a genome-wide transcript analysis of vtc <dig> plants, pastori et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes with altered expression, among which defence genes constituted a significant subgroup. here, in the steady state, in  <dig> ppm co <dig>  to which the plants were adapted to, the transcript levels of 2cpa, csd <dig> and sapx were balanced. the transcript level of ferritin- <dig> was even decreased. the transcript level of bap- <dig> was  <dig> -fold increased and constitutively high upon variation of the co2-availability, demonstrating that the transcript abundance is dominantly regulated by the mutational defect in ascorbate biosynthesis.

the transcript levels of bap <dig>  fer <dig>  rbcs and stp <dig>  although to different extends, negatively correlated with the ascorbate content and positively with the reduction state. apparently metabolically induced alterations in ascorbate levels caused similar transcriptional changes as genetic mutations in ascorbate biosynthesis  <cit> . in our analysis the correlation between ascorbate and defence gene expression was stronger when the data set of the vtc1-mutant was not included  demonstrating that in vtc <dig> hardening responses may mask signalling induced by the variation of co2-availability.

the strongest relationship between the reduction state of ascorbate and transcript level regulation was observed for 2cpa. in previous experiments strong suppression of 2cpa transcription was observed upon ascorbate application  <cit> . here, responses upon internal variation of the ascorbate content were analyzed. a strong negative correlation  with the reduction state of ascorbate, but absence of correlation with the ascorbate content  excludes sensing the ascorbate availability. it is postulated that either specifically dehydroascorbate or, more likely, the electron consumption in dehydroascorbate reduction regulates 2cpa transcript abundance.

coupling of transcript abundance regulation
a set of four genes, i.e. bap <dig>  psaa, psba and stp <dig>  showed a similar transcript pattern in response to the seven metabolic parameters, i.e. glutathione contents and reduction state, 3-pga and dhap contents, the calculated nadph reduction state and assimilatory force, and the hydrolysable sugars . it should be noted that transcript levels of psaa and psba changed in parallel in response to the imposed metabolic and mutational strains. this contrasts the anti-parallel responses of psaab and psbb observed upon transfer to photosystem i and ii-specific light regime previously described by pfannschmidt et al.  <cit> . it is concluded that a variation between  <dig> and  <dig> ppm co <dig> in the mutant background elicits more severe changes in metabolism and signalling than altering the light quality from red to far red at very low photon flux density  <cit> . however, the photosystem i transcript psaa decreased relative to the photosystem ii transcript psba when the electron pressure was reduced by increasing the co2-availability , e.g. from  <dig>   to  <dig>  to  <dig>   in wt indicating a stronger transcription of genes for the ps-i reaction centre protein in  <dig> ppm co <dig> and those encoding ps-ii reaction centre proteins in  <dig> ppm co <dig>  in adg <dig>  the gradual response was unaffected, however generally the transcript abundance of psba was higher than that of psaa . in pgr <dig> the relative transcript abundance normalized to wt at  <dig> ppm was also higher under all three co <dig> conditions, suggesting that the higher psba transcript levels were caused by photoinhibitory high carbohydrate availability or a limitation in the rieske activity.

it is tempting to suggest that the signal is transmitted by pq-dependent redox signals. however, in vtc <dig> more psaa than psba was observed at  <dig> ppm co <dig>  a balanced psaa/psba ratio in  <dig> ppm co <dig> and an inverted ratio in  <dig> ppm, demonstrating that the ascorbate availability affects the stoichiometry of transcripts for the photoreaction centres upon variation of the co2-availability. after  <dig> h fumigation with  <dig> ppm co <dig>  the steady state quantum yield of ps-ii /fm') was wt-like , while the quantum yield was adjusted to  <dig> -fold higher levels within  <dig>  min of illumination upon doubling of the light intensity . on the background of decreased ascorbate availability  this demonstrates that the photosynthetic electron transport chain was otherwise protected. chlorophyll fluorescence analysis showed that the acclimation was insufficient to protect the photosynthetic membrane in low co <dig>  the low quantum yield of ps-ii  demonstrates even stronger photosynthetic impairment than in wt. that the regulation of the quantum yield of ps-ii does not correlate with the psaa/psba-ratios, supports the hypothesis that the regulation of the transcript abundance of the photoreaction centre proteins is more dependent on ascorbate-specific signals than on the redox state of the pq-pool. the pq-dependent long term acclimation response postulated by pfannschmidt et al.  <cit>  appears further subordinate to signals linked to the metabolic state of the pga and dhap concentrations, the nadph/nadp+ ratio, the assimilatory force and hydrolysable sugars . in adg <dig> a perfect positive correlation  was observed between the concentration of soluble sugars and the psba transcript levels, whereas the other lines showed a high negative correlation , highlighting the importance of carbohydrate-dependent signals in psaa and psba regulation.

correlation with the adenylate status
in animals, the energy status sensed for instance via insulin-like growth factor  <dig> or by amp-dependent kinases plays an important role in regulation of gene expression  <cit> . however, here except an only weak  correlation for 2cpa, no correlations between the adenylate status and transcript levels were indicated. due to the photoautotrophic nature of plants, plants rarely encountered energy deprivation. further on, the chloroplast and cellular adenylate status directly coordinates metabolic pathways via feed-back and feed-forward mechanisms  <cit> . the lack of strong energy-linked regulation demonstrates that the adenylate phosphorylation state may not be a major signal, which is directly linked to the regulation of nuclear gene expression in context of photosynthesis.

however, the analysis of pgr <dig> showed a mutant specific regulation of csd <dig>  sapx and 2cpa upon altered co2-availability . because pgr <dig> is unable to acidify the thylakoid lumen below ph  <dig> due to a mutation in the rieske protein  <cit> , the atp/adp ratio was very low in the morning and generally decreased irrespective of the co2concentration . the concentrations of most metabolites were not significantly changed in response to altered co <dig> availability compared to wt indicating efficient metabolic compensation . the transcript levels of csd <dig>  sapx and 2cpa were regulated in a mutant specific manner, while rbcs, bap <dig>  fer <dig> and stp <dig> responded wt-like demonstrating that ros- and carbohydrate signalling pathways were unaffected  <cit> . upon the different treatments of pgr <dig> the transcript abundance of sapx highly correlated with the calculated reduction state of nadph , while no correlation was observed in the other plant lines. it is therefore concluded that the mutation in the rieske protein limits the fine-control of sapx expression and makes it more dependent on stromal redox signals. the difference in sapx regulation between pgr <dig> and wt also demonstrates that in wt the rieske protein influences sapx expression. excluding ros-signalling, because the bap <dig> control was wt-like, either the redox state of the pq pool or thylakoid acidification/the adenylate status may modulate sapx transcript abundance.

the csd <dig> transcript levels positively correlated with apx activity in all lines under all treatments . concomitantly, in pgr <dig>  also an almost perfect correlation was observed with the redox state of nadph. compared to sapx the csd <dig> transcript level was regulated with higher amplitudes. sapx and csd <dig> transcripts encode two prominent chloroplast antioxidant enzymes, which successively act in superoxide and h2o <dig> detoxification in the stromal part of the halliwell-asada cycle   <cit> . coordinated regulation of transcript abundance points out expressional co-regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in the cell, metabolite, redox and energy signals are tightly linked, which makes differentiation of signalling cascades difficult. this study demonstrates that comparison of mutants with specific limitations in the coordination of plant acclimation at least transiently uncouples signalling branches. comparison of adg <dig>  pgr <dig> and vtc <dig> with arabidopsis wild-type plants showed coordinated expression of bap <dig>  psaa, psaa and stp <dig>  which have been discussed previously to respond specifically to singlet oxygen  <cit> , the redox state of the pq pool  <cit>  and monosaccharide availability  <cit> , respectively. like ferritin- <dig>  bap <dig> and stp <dig> correlated strongest with the ascorbate contents, while for psaa and psba a stronger link to the assimilatory force and nadph/nadp+ ratio was indicated. correlation of 2cpa expression, whose transcription is controlled by the acceptor availability at photosystem i in wt  <cit> , with the redox state of the ascorbate pool further strengthens the links between the antioxidant system and the photosynthetic electron transport and more specifically chloroplast-to-nucleus signalling. it is postulated that during evolution a stabilized network has evolved which links photosynthetic metabolism to nuclear gene expression. mutants might be well balanced under standard conditions, but application of environmental changes leads to an altered acclimation in comparison to wt, which allows to tentatively differentiate parallel induced signalling cascades.
