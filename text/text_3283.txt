BACKGROUND
age-related changes in adult stem cells contribute to the decline in tissue regenerative capacity  <cit> . adult stem cells are the primary driving force for tissue, and hence organ specific self-renewal. the observed reduction in tissue regenerative capacity suggests diminished stem cell numbers in addition to compromised differentiation and specific lineage commitment ability  <cit> . in rats and mice, aging compromises the efficacy of mscs geared towards regeneration of damaged myocardial tissue  <cit> . the aging micro-environment has also been shown to pose an inhibitory effect on adult stem cell mediated regeneration  <cit> . genes involved in stemness, genomic integrity and regulation of transcription are age-repressed in mscs undergoing replicative senescence in vitro  <cit> . in this study, mscs derived from the bone marrow of  <dig> month old rats  were compared to those derived from  <dig> month old rats .

RESULTS
characterization of young and old bm-mscs and assessment of changes in pluripotent marker expression
the yield of mscs from the bone marrow of all four individual old rats was lower than that of young rats. we observed higher numbers of plastic adherent colonies in all four individual young rat cultures  <dig> hours after initial seeding of equal volumes  of bone marrow aspirates from each individual animal. young rat cultures expanded rapidly, and reached over 80% confluence before day  <dig> post primary isolation. in comparison, adherent colonies only became apparent in all four old rat cultures after  <dig> days post primary isolation . young bm-mscs displayed elongated fibroblast-like spindle shaped morphology . old bm-mscs displayed a spread out, flat enlarged morphology  with nuclei that appeared larger in size. using a cedex hires non-flow imaging cytometer, we observed larger average cell diameter in trypsinized old bm-msc cultures . all young and old bm-msc cultures were negative for cd <dig> and cd <dig>  and positive for cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> . we tested the hypothesis that there might be age-related differences in the expression profile of oct- <dig>  sox- <dig> and nanog in bm-mscs derived from young and old bone marrow. while old bm-mscs expressed oct- <dig>  the fluorescence signal intensity was significantly lower in comparison to that observed in young msc cultures . the immunocytochemical observations were corroborated by qpcr; we failed to detect sox- <dig> and nanog in old bm-mscs but all three markers were detected in young bm-mscs by qpcr .

multilineage differentiation capacity is diminished in bm-mscs from old rats
we assessed the plasticity of young and old bm-mscs by inducing differentiation into fat forming adipocytes, bone forming osteocytes, cartilage forming chondrocytes and cardiomyogenic cells. we observed the accumulation of triglycerides in the cytoplasm of young bm-mscs after  <dig> hours of exposure to adipogenic differentiation media. young bm-mscs progressively changed morphology, and the size and number of lipid vacuoles formed increased over  <dig> days of differentiation. transformation peaked at  <dig> days of differentiation, after which all young bm-mscs in each culture plate became fully formed adipocytes and detached from the culture surface into suspension . the resulting adipocytes stained positive for oil red-o and the adipocyte lipid-binding protein fabp <dig> . old bm-msc cultures changed morphology but failed to differentiate over  <dig> days of induction in adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation media . we did not detect fabp <dig> in old bm-msc cultures and oil red-o staining was negative . we also observed the production of a mineralized matrix and the formation of bone nodules in vitro in young bm-msc cultures after  <dig> hours of exposure to osteogenic differentiation media. osteogenic differentiation of young msc cultures peaked at day  <dig> with a complete change in cell morphology and gradual detachment of bone nodules into suspension . young msc cultures stained positive for anti-osteocalcin and alizarin-red . after  <dig> days of exposure to chondrogenic differentiation media, we observed the formation of proteoglycan-rich soft collagen matrix in young bm-msc cultures . transformation peaked at day  <dig> with a complete change in bm-msc morphology and detachment of fully formed chondrocytes into suspension . the differentiated chondrogenic cells also stained positive for anti-aggrecan . fluorescence signal intensity as detected by immunocytochemistry was significantly higher in young bm-msc cultures .

to further assess self-renewal and differentiation capacity in young and old bm-mscs, we induced cardiomyogenesis with a cocktail mixture of bone morphogenetic protein , fibroblast growth factor  and insulin-like growth factor . old bm-mscs progressively changed morphology and in some cultures, we observed cell death in response to cardiomyogenic differentiation media . young bm-msc cultures first proliferated to become over confluent and progressively changed morphology. we observed progressive enlargement and elongation in young bm-msc cultures with the formation of ball and stick-like morphology . by day  <dig> of induction, the differentiating bm-mscs formed a long cytoplasmic process with a vacuolated appearance  similar to that observed in adipogenesis but with uniquely different surface and morphological characteristics  <cit> . we did not observe contracting cells typical of nvcm. however, differentiating cells connected to adjoining cells, and formed myotube-like structures and string-bead like formations . immunostaining of differentiated cells for gata  <dig>  nkx <dig> , ctni, ctnt, ctnc and myosin heavy chain was strongly positive and revealed bi-nucleation . induced old bm-mscs failed to express the same set of cardiac markers . the immunocytochemical observations were corroborated by qpcr; we failed to detect significant levels of nkx <dig> , gata  <dig>  ctni, ctnt, ctnc and ctropomoysin transcripts in old bm-mscs .

young and old rat bm-mscs form gap junctions and undergo cardiomyogenesis in co-culture with nvcm
the presence of cardiac connexins which form the basis for cell-to-cell communication has been shown in human and rat mscs and between mscs and cardiomyocytes  <cit> . we hypothesized here that there might be age-related differences in the expression of the gap junction protein connexin- <dig> in mscs alone and in co-culture with ventricular cardiomyocytes. we observed the typical punctate staining pattern of connexin- <dig> in both young and old bm-msc cultures and in nvcm . fluorescence intensity of connexin- <dig> staining as detected by immunocytochemistry was significantly higher in young bm-msc cultures . when layered over a subconfluent culture of nvcm, young and old bm-mscs coupled and fused with adjacent nvcm colonies. fused young and old bm-mscs expressed gata  <dig>  nkx <dig> , connexin- <dig>  ctni, ctnt and myosin heavy chain, but failed to express α-sarcomeric actinin in co-culture with nvcm .

assessment of dna damage and telomerase activity in young and old bm-mscs
the phosphorylated histone h2a variant, γ-h2ax is a sensitive indicator of dna damage  <cit> . we postulated that mscs derived from the bone marrow of old rats will express higher levels of γ-h2ax while displaying diminished levels of telomerase activity. we detected significantly higher levels of γ-h2ax, in old bm-msc cultures . we failed to detect expression of γ-h2ax in young bm-msc cultures . furthermore, telomerase activity  and population growth  was significantly higher in young bm-msc cultures. transplanted mscs have been shown to provide a major beneficial effect through paracrine signaling  <cit> ; similar effects are to be expected when young and old bm-mscs are transplanted. we therefore tested the hypothesis that young and old bm-mscs might differentially express and secrete growth factors and cytokines. old bm-mscs expressed significantly lower levels of vegf, egf, igf and g-csf transcripts .

discussion
we demonstrated here using a rodent model that there were differences in bm-mscs associated with the age of the animal from which the cells were isolated. we observed rapid expansion in young bm-msc cultures and striking age-related differences in cell morphology, population size and proliferation. young bm-mscs displayed elongated fibroblast-like spindle shaped morphology. old bm-mscs displayed spread out, flat enlarged morphology which is consistent with late passage and extensively cultured bm-mscs  <cit> . consistent with age-related decreased proliferation, we observed diminished telomerase activity and significantly higher levels of the dna double strand break marker γ-h2ax in old bm-mscs. human fetal bone marrow is known to contain approximately  <dig> in  <dig>   <dig> mscs in comparison to  <dig> in  <dig>   <dig> in adults  <cit> . consistent with our observations here, studies in rats, mice, and rhesus macaque monkeys indicate that there is a correlation between age and declining numbers of bm-msc  <cit> .

there is conflicting data with regard to the effect of aging on the bone forming ability of bm-mscs  <cit> . a few studies find no effect, but the majority find age-related decline in differentiation potential  <cit> . in this study, old bm-mscs failed to differentiate into osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes. we assessed cardiomyogenic potential by stimulation with a cocktail mixture of bmp- <dig>  fgf- <dig> and igf- <dig>  in co-culture with nvcm and with conditioned media derived from the co-culture system. old bm-mscs failed to commit to the cardiac lineage when induced with the cocktail mixture and conditioned media. we observed expression of the cardiac phenotype in both young and old bm-mscs in co-culture with nvcm. when injected into infarcted myocardium, old rat bm-mscs displayed scant myogenic transdifferentiation and failed to adopt host myocardial tissue architecture in comparison to young mscs  <cit> . a potential drawback to co-culture is the fact that fusion of the two different cell types can be misinterpreted as transdifferentiation  <cit> . expression of the cardiac phenotype in old bm-mscs under co-culture conditions in this present study maybe explained in part by cell fusion.

we did not detect striations typical of nvcm in young and old bm-mscs as evidenced by the lack of α-sarcomeric actinin staining in either cell type. furthermore, a significant number of gfp positive cells in old bm-msc cultures failed to express the cardiac proteins analyzed in this study. positive staining for cardiac proteins was observed in regions of the co-culture system where gfp positive bm-mscs had fused with nvcm. it is not clear that old bm-mscs acquired a broader differentiation potential in co-culture with nvcm that enabled commitment to the cardiac lineage. both young and old bm-mscs expressed the gap junction protein connexin- <dig>  therefore, it is more probable that old bm-mscs fused with nvcm and took on their characteristics. great interest in bm-mscs is based in part on their ability to improve function, angiogenesis and neovascularivation via paracrine and cytokine signaling; the same is to be expected of transplanted young and old bm-mscs. the neovascularization and angiogenesis effects of bm-mscs are enhanced by the presence of specific growth and cytokine factors  <cit> . in this study, we observed markedly lower levels of g-csf, igf, egf and vegf transcripts in old bm-mscs.

the inability of old bm-mscs to respond to differentiation media maybe explained in part by the fact that the bm-msc isolation method typically results in slight heterogeneity in the cell population at early primary isolation due to hematopoietic stem cell contamination which affects the in vitro behavior of the cells. we observed higher contamination by hematopoietic stem cells in old bm-msc cultures at early passage by flow cytometry . however, young and old bm-mscs uniformly expressed cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  and failed to express cd <dig> and cd <dig> at passage  <dig>  it is more likely that the related genes necessary for efficient adipogenesis, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and cardiomyogenesis were age-repressed in our old bm-mscs  <cit> . an alternative explanation is that our old bm-mscs had already partially differentiated to another lineage prior to induction with differentiation media. this is highly unlikely; the differentiation experiments in this study were carried out in triplicate  on individual cell populations derived from the bone marrow of individual rats  for each age group. we induced young and old bm-mscs under uniform conditions at passage  <dig> 

the uniform expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and absence of cd <dig> and cd <dig> in either age group as observed in this study indicates homogeneity in the bm-msc population. it does not necessarily correlate with multidifferentiation capacity. hence, the complete loss of chondrogenic, osteogenic and cardiomyogenic potential may also be due to an age-related loss in multipotency. the combinatorial transcription factor interaction network of oct- <dig>  nanog and sox- <dig> which confers stemness and maintains pluripotency in embryonic stem cells is well documented  <cit> . using an in vitro aging model, yew et al. recently showed that bm-mscs show decreased expression of oct- <dig> and nanog at late passage. they also showed that the knockdown of p <dig> rescues the loss in differentiation capacity and potentiates expression of oct- <dig> and nanog  <cit> . we observed age-related changes in the expression profile of the three pluripotency markers oct- <dig>  sox- <dig> and nanog. old bm-mscs expressed oct- <dig>  albeit at a lower intensity in comparison to young bm-mscs, but failed to express sox- <dig> and nanog. while its presence does not automatically result in pluripotency, precise levels of oct- <dig> are required to maintain pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, and its lack thereof results in germ line specific differentiation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our observations here present definitive evidence that there are age-related changes in mscs derived from the bone marrow of old rodents with regard to plasticity and basic stem cell biology. these results support the conclusion that the efficacy of bm-mscs is compromised as a function of donor age.
