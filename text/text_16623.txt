BACKGROUND
human artificial chromosomes are currently being developed as tools for functional annotation of the genome and as potential vectors for gene therapy and other biotechnological applications . strategies for the creation of artificial or engineered chromosomes can be broadly divided into two classes: top down, based on the truncation of an existing chromosome into a much smaller mini-chromosome suitable for further manipulation, and bottom up, whereby defined, cloned chromosomal elements are assembled in vitro into a prefabricated unit that is capable of nucleating formation of a hac de novo upon introduction into human cells  <cit> . these cloned chromosomal elements may also be assembled in cultured cells through a combination of non-homologous recombination and end-joining mechanisms  <cit> . thus far, both approaches have resulted in the creation of a de novo hac composed of large concatamers of the input dna species . these de novo hacs are mitotically stable in the absence of selection, associate with key centromere and kinetochore proteins and are functionally comparable to the native chromosomes of the host cell. furthermore, hacs containing two genomic loci, for hprt and gch <dig>  have demonstrated evidence of functionality in certain cell culture models, establishing the potential application of hacs as vectors for gene transfer  <cit> .

creation of artificial chromosomes de novo minimally requires a cloned centromeric element of either natural  <cit>  or synthetic  <cit>  origin. only higher-order alpha-satellite dna, found at the centromeres of all normal human chromosomes  <cit> , has been shown to be capable of nucleating centromere formation de novo. alpha-satellite dna consists of a hierarchical structure of tandem repetitive monomers of ~ <dig> bp, which may be further organized into higher-order repeat units over many hundreds of kilobases  <cit> . higher-order alpha-satellite dna is capable of establishing the assembly of a protein/dna complex, the kinetochore, which mediates the interactions between the chromosome and the spindle apparatus during cell division  <cit> . these and other lines of evidence suggest that alpha-satellite dna of this type represents the functional centromere in normal human chromosomes  <cit> .

in addition to a functioning centromere, linear artificial chromosomes require synthetic telomeres, which are capable of seeding large telomeric arrays in vivo  <cit> . however, telomeric dna is not required for the creation of circular hacs de novo, and its presence or absence appears to have no significant impact on the stability of such hacs  <cit> .

finally, hac vectors require origins of dna replication that are functionally analogous to autonomously replicating sequence  elements in yeast  <cit> . however, mammalian origins of replication remain poorly defined  <cit> , although at least some mammalian origin elements  have been documented that continue to behave as such when translocated to an ectopic chromosomal location  <cit> . notwithstanding uncertainty about the genomic features that constitute an origin, mammalian origins of replication have been shown to occur on average once every ~ <dig> kb  <cit> . de novo hac formation at frequencies of at least 10% has been documented from bac vectors containing only cloned alpha-satellite dna  <cit> , implying that replication origin function must be supplied by elements within alpha-satellite or the bac vector backbone. notwithstanding this result, we reasoned that we could augment de novo hac formation by providing any genomic fragment of at least  <dig> kb in cis to the centromeric element of the hac vector, thereby providing additional origin function and potentially additional unidentified functional elements, or simply by providing improved stability as a consequence of an increase in the size of the hac vector.

to circumvent technical difficulties in the manipulation of high-molecular weight dna by traditional cloning techniques  <cit> , we have developed a novel transposition-based approach to rapidly retrofit genomic bac clones with telomeres and other key functional elements. ligation of the linearized derivatives of these retrofitted bac vectors  with a complementary linearized bac vector containing a synthetic d17z <dig> alpha-satellite array  <cit>  and a telomere  results in the assembly of a linear prefabricated hac vector containing the defined genomic fragment of interest. here, we apply this method to the construction and validation of hac vectors containing different large fragments from the human genome, representing a diverse group of functionally validated de novo hacs containing human genes.

in the course of this work, we observed that certain genomic loci appear to greatly facilitate the formation of de novo hacs, suggesting the existence of at least one additional parameter to be optimized during the development of future iterations of hac vectors. such loci may contain origins of replication  <cit> , scaffold or matrix attachment regions   <cit>  or other functionally significant chromosomal elements that might contribute to hac formation and/or stability. we have applied this approach to the construction of a prefabricated hac vector incorporating the entire  <dig> kb ß-globin genomic locus, which contains a well-defined mammalian origin of replication  <cit> . we demonstrate efficient rates of formation of these ß-globin hacs and provide evidence of persistent gene expression. taken together, the ability to rapidly create multiple, functionally validated bac-based hac vectors incorporating any defined genomic locus represents a promising advance in the development of hac vector technology.

RESULTS
assembly of linear, prefabricated hac vectors
the bimolecular bac-based hac vector system is comprised of a centromere-containing "cen arm" containing an  <dig> kb d17z1-derived synthetic alpha-satellite array  <cit>  and a "gen arm", incorporating a defined, large  genomic fragment. both bac-cen and bac-gen additionally contain ~ <dig> bp synthetic telomeres  <cit>  and selectable markers as indicated in figure  <dig>  a linearized cen arm is generated by digestion of bac-cen with the ultra-rare homing endonucleases i-ceui and pi-scei, which creates a unique, non-self complementary overhang.

any genomic bac vector may be retrofitted to form a bac-gen vector by transposition with a custom-built tn <dig> based transposon  <cit>  incorporating a telomere, selectable markers and appropriately oriented recognition sites for i-ceui and pi-scei  <cit> . transposition of the telomere cassette is non-site specific, and insertions into either the bac vector backbone or genomic insert can be isolated. we were able to generate vector backbone transpositions for all vj104-based genomic bacs  and genomic transpositions for bacs containing the hgh, pkd <dig> and ß-globin loci. for the latter, the integration site of the transposon was established by direct sequencing, and the transposon was confirmed to not interrupt either the target gene or its established regulatory elements .

the bac-gen arm is linearized in a similar manner to bac-cen, generating an overhang that is complementary only to the residual pi-scei overhang created from the cen arm. a ligation between the linearized cen and gen arms generates a prefabricated, linear hac vector , which may be gel-purified and introduced into mammalian cells by transfection or direct nuclear microinjection; alternatively, the entire ligation reaction may be transfected directly.

we assembled a collection of thirteen bac-gen vectors representing different genomic loci  that were shotgun subcloned or identified through the public databases as containing genes of potential therapeutic interest . a summary of the sizes and chromosomal origins of each of these genomic fragments is indicated in table  <dig>  prefabricated hac vectors containing each of these genomic loci were generated by the methodology described in figures  <dig> and  <dig> and transfected into ht <dig> cells, resulting in the formation of large, cytogenetically visible de novo hacs presumably composed of concatamers of the initial dna species. assembly of the prefabricated hac was monitored in all cases by pfge or fige  .

impact of different genomic loci on de novo hac formation
the efficiency of de novo hac formation from prefabricated hac vectors containing different genomic loci is summarized in table  <dig>  all hacs were validated structurally by fish analysis with probes against d17z <dig> alpha-satellite, bac vector, genomic insert and telomeric dna, as shown in figure 3a–c. de novo centromere formation was demonstrated by the localization of cenp-c to the hac ; cenp-c is an established marker of functional centromeres  <cit> . although the numbers of clones are modest, it is clear from the data in table  <dig> that not all the genomic loci examined form hacs at similar efficiency. for example, some genomic loci  form hacs only rarely . in contrast, fragments g <dig>  and g <dig>  appear to facilitate de novo hac formation much more efficiently. fragment g <dig> is a  <dig>  bp noti fragment represented on the genome scaffold by bac accession numbers ac <dig>  and ac <dig> . fragment g <dig> is a  <dig>  bp noti fragment represented on the genome scaffold by bac accession numbers ac <dig> and ac <dig>  other loci, including the hgh and pkd <dig> genomic loci, form hacs at intermediate frequencies . interestingly, the hgh locus in a prefabricated vector formed hacs at approximately the same frequency as reported earlier for the same locus in a different vector system  <cit> , suggesting that this intermediate frequency is indeed a property of the genomic locus.

functionality of ß-globin hac vectors
it is important to determine whether genes introduced as part of hac vectors are functional in the recipient host cell. as a proof of principle, we have generated evidence of sustained gene expression from cytogenetically validated hacs containing the entire  <dig> kb ß-globin genomic locus, establishing the potential application of future iterations of these hacs for gene transfer. as shown in figure  <dig>  expression from the third exon of ß-globin is continuously detectable by rt-pcr from clones containing ß-globin hacs after  <dig> days of culture in the absence of selective pressure in the cell line ht <dig>  a fibrosarcoma line that does not express ß-globin. expression of ß-globin continues to be detectable in the absence of selection for > <dig> days of continuous culture .

discussion
design and validation of bimolecular bac-based hac vectors
hacs are believed to function by reproducing the three known critical elements of naturally occurring chromosomes: centromeres, telomeres and origins of replication  <cit> . optimization of hac formation may theoretically be achieved by the systematic identification and manipulation of factors that affect the efficiency of formation and subsequent stability of each of these key functional elements. for example, in previous studies, we and others have used de novo centromere formation as an assay to design and evaluate synthetic d17z1-based alpha-satellite arrays with modifications in the density and distribution of the consensus cenp-b box, a protein binding site known to impact the effectiveness of de novo centromere formation  <cit> . we have shown that d17z1-based arrays containing an increased number of cenp-b boxes relative to native d17z <dig> show a corresponding increase in the efficiency of de novo hac assembly  <cit> .

in this report, we employ de novo hac formation as an assay to identify genomic loci that are highly efficient in hac formation and are thus candidates for containing origins of replication, s/mars or other cis-acting functional elements that may impact the formation and/or maintenance of hacs. we assembled a collection of genomic dnas in the 100– <dig> kb size range  and assayed their ability to support the formation of de novo hacs.

construction of multiple bac-based hacs demands the development of novel bac modification methodologies, owing to the difficulties inherent in the manipulation of high-molecular weight dnas by traditional subcloning techniques  <cit> . a first step towards achieving eventual defined composition of matter for hac vectors  <cit>  requires moving away from uncontrolled in vivo mechanisms for hac vector assembly  <cit>  towards construction of pre-fabricated hac vectors containing clearly defined centromeric and other genomic elements. the controlled and systematic generation of large synthetic or naturally derived alpha-satellite arrays is itself difficult, but manageable  <cit> . once derived however, these alpha-satellite arrays must be efficiently and predictably brought together with the genomic fragment of interest to create a prefabricated hac vector.

a number of in vivo site-specific recombination approaches to join large alpha satellite arrays with large genomic fragments have been reported  <cit> , involving multi-step recombinogenic methodologies whose limitations are evidenced by the fact that few genomic loci have to date been reported to have been successfully incorporated into a hac vector. in contrast, our transposon-based strategy for the construction of bimolecular bac-based hac vectors has facilitated the high-throughput creation of de novo hacs from multiple large genomic loci. additionally, our laboratory has recently reported a complementary transposon-based methodology for the rapid retrofitting of genomic bacs into unimolecular bac-hac vectors, by the mobilization of a single transposable element containing alpha-satellite, telomeric dna and mammalian selectable markers  <cit> . this latter approach may be even more efficient overall, avoiding the requirement for an in vitro ligation between two distinct dna species and providing the flexibility to create either circular or linear derivatives of the same bac-hac vector as needed  <cit> .

on the other hand, the strategy detailed in the current report involves modification of a target genomic bac with a much smaller transposable element, enabling the retrofitting of the target bac with the desired functional cassettes to be achieved in a more straightforward and efficient manner. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that trace amounts of recircularized cen or gen arms  are co-purified with the prefabricated species and contribute to de novo hac formation, or, if the entire ligation reaction is used, determine to what extent individual, linearized cen or gen arms contribute to de novo hac assembly by end-joining or non-homologous recombination mechanisms  <cit> . given that the resultant de novo hacs are ultimately produced by the uncontrolled concatamerization of the starting dna species, this point, while noteworthy, is not significant in our view.

it is important to view the current strategy attempting to create prefabricated hac vectors in the context of iterative progress towards the eventual achievement of defined composition of matter for de novo hacs, while understanding that this remains a goal yet to be accomplished  <cit> . only when this objective has been reached will dissection of the relative contributions of "contaminating" alternative forms of the starting vectors be truly meaningful. nevertheless, the overall effectiveness of the current methodology has facilitated the construction and functional validation of multiple de novo hacs derived from a significant collection of genomic loci, thereby establishing hac technology as a general one suitable for analysis of in principle any locus in the genome.

cis-acting genomic loci affect de novo hac formation
although the current study was initiated to provide a functional platform for the identification of functional genomic elements in a manner analogous to that first used to identify autonomously replicating sequences  in yeast  <cit> , we stress that we currently have no independent biochemical or other confirmation that the observed effects on hac formation frequencies are actually related to the presence or absence of replication origins, s/mars or any other specific functional elements. nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to propose variation in origin function as one hypothesis to explain the observed differences in de novo hac assembly, and further experiments will be required to explore this possibility.

as seen in table  <dig>  the majority of genomic fragments surveyed support de novo hac formation at frequencies consistent with previous reports using vectors that lack genomic fragments or contain a limited number of other genomic fragments  <cit> . indeed, our own previous results using bac vectors containing only the synthetic,  <dig> kb d17z1-based alpha-satellite array used in the current report generates a baseline for de novo hac formation of  <dig> % from  <dig> analyzed clones  <cit> . the majority of genomic fragments surveyed  appear to support de novo hac formation at frequencies comparable to alpha-satellite alone  <cit> . we note that the unimolecular bac-hac vector reported in  <cit>  incorporating the same hgh genomic region used in the current report forms de novo hacs at similar intermediate frequencies comparable to that observed here . other genomic loci  do appear to facilitate de novo hac formation at efficiencies above the baseline . most notably, genomic loci g <dig> and g <dig> support de novo hac formation at frequencies of over 70%, substantially higher than other genomic fragments of similar size. these effects clearly cannot be explained as the result of a simple increase in the size of the hac vector, as this would result in a general increase in de novo hac formation regardless of which specific genomic fragment was utilized. further dissection of these  <dig> kb fragments is currently underway to isolate smaller subfragments that may be incorporated as a functional cassette into the design of future iterations of hac vectors.

cell line specific effects on de novo hac formation and gene expression
the current report is based on the analysis of de novo hac formation in the ht <dig> fibrosarcoma cell line, consistent with all previously reported studies on the assembly of de novo hacs . although no systematic examination of the role of the host cell environment on rates of de novo hac formation has yet been reported, it remains formally possible that the cis-acting effects of adjacent genomic loci on de novo hac formation are contingent on certain cellular environments. although the choice of the ht <dig> cell line for use in this and other related studies  <cit>  is largely historical, we have observed comparable rates of de novo hac formation in the  <dig> and other closely related cell lines using bac vectors containing only cloned alpha-satellite dna .

the observation that de novo hacs incorporating a  <dig> kb ß-globin genomic locus do in fact express ß-globin in the non-erythroid ht <dig> cell line is noteworthy . although these hacs contain the entire 5' and 3' locus control regions established as being critical for the regulation of globin gene expression in a physiologically appropriate manner  <cit> , it appears that the cloned ß-globin genomic dna, upon introduction into the cell nucleus in the context of a hac vector, does not adopt the repressive chromatin configuration found at the endogenous, host cell ß-globin locus. this observation may potentially be highly significant if found to be consistent with the behavior of additional genes upon introduction into the nucleus as hac vectors, as it impacts on the ability to reproducibly and reliably obtain cell- and tissue specific-patterns of gene expression for applications in biotechnology. finally, although we have not rigorously quantified ß-globin gene expression from clones containing de novo ß-globin hac vectors over time, we do note that ß-globin gene expression is stably observed by the rt-pcr assay of figure  <dig> over the 90-day time period used in the current report .

CONCLUSIONS
hac vectors provide a novel approach to human genome annotation and gene transfer that may ultimately circumvent many of the technical difficulties currently associated with standard, retroviral-based gene therapy vectors  <cit> . these include position effects on gene expression and transgene silencing  and a strict, upper packaging limit permitting delivery of only about  <dig> kb of foreign dna  <cit> , precluding the incorporation of critical genomic elements that may be required for physiologically meaningful expression of a therapeutic transgene  <cit> . additionally, integration of viral vectors into the host genome has been shown to result in oncogene activation leading to cancer  <cit> . finally, viral vectors used in recent clinical trials have resulted in severe immunological reactions and death  <cit> .

in contrast to the capacity limits of conventional gene transfer vectors, we have been able to design and construct hac vectors that contain the entire  <dig> kb ß-globin genomic region, including the 5' locus control region required for ß-globin gene regulation and expression  <cit> , thereby bypassing the requirement to identify, dissect and repackage critical regulatory elements into mini-genes capable of being delivered by potentially immunogenic viral vectors. we have shown sustained gene expression from these ß-globin hacs in the absence of selective pressure during at least  <dig> days of continuous culture. similarly, we have designed and fabricated hac vectors incorporating the entire hgh  and pkd <dig>  genomic loci; the pkd <dig> cdna itself is over  <dig> kb, well outside the range of retroviral gene therapy vectors  <cit> .

in summary, we anticipate that the functional identification and optimization of individual chromosomal components using the hac vector systems described here and elsewhere  <cit>  will eventually permit the design and construction of prefabricated, custom built hac vectors incorporating any therapeutic gene in the context of its full complement of endogenous, genomic regulatory elements. hac vectors may therefore not only fulfill their potential in biotechnology, but will additionally lead to significant advances in the functional annotation of the genome.
