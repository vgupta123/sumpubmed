BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes, triacylglycerol  is synthesized through both acyl-coa-dependent and acyl-coa-independent processes  <cit> . acyl-coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferase  catalyzes the acylation of sn- <dig> -diacylglycerol  to generate tag and coa. various acyl donors have also been identified in the acyl-coa independent acylation of dag including a second dag molecule  <cit> , phosphatidylcholine  <cit> and free fatty acid  <cit> . studies on the acyl-coa-dependent acylation of tag, however, have been more extensive since this pathway has been recognized for several years. two families of dgat, designated dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  have been identified with homologues in animals, plants and various microorganisms  <cit> . dgat <dig> cdna was first cloned from mus musculus liver  <cit>  and shortly thereafter from developing seeds of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and microspore-derived cell suspension cultures of brassica napus  <cit> . recently, dgat <dig> cdna has been cloned from other plant sources including developing castor bean   <cit>  and seeds of burning bush   <cit> . deduced amino acid sequences of members of the dgat <dig> gene family, however, have been shown to share no homology with the dgat <dig> family  <cit> . it is important to note that a second cdna encoding a b. napus dgat, which represented a truncated form of dgat <dig>  has been previously designated dgat <dig>  <cit> . the hydropathy plots of dgat <dig> from various species are very similar in that the polypeptides all display a hydrophilic n-terminal segment followed by a number of potential transmembrane intrapolypeptide segments  <cit> . the general characteristic of the dgat <dig> hydropathy plot is also very similar to that of type  <dig> acyl-coa:cholesterol acyltransferase , which uses cholesterol as an acyl acceptor instead of dag  <cit> . structure/function relationships in acats have been more fully elucidated than for dgats. for example, the topologies of acat <dig> and acat <dig> have been determined and have provided valuable insights into the operation of this enzyme  <cit> .

the current study was undertaken to gain insight into the structure and function properties of b. napus dgat <dig>  using a poly-his tagged recombinant hydrophilic n-terminal region of the enzyme which is designated bndgat1his <dig>  the recombinant enzyme fragment interacted with acyl-coa displaying positive cooperativity and self-associated to form a dimer and tetramer, which was consistent with recent reports on the self-association of human dgat <dig>  <cit>  and mammalian acat <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
expression, purification and crystallization of bndgat1his6
a very brief description of the procedure for generating bndgat1his <dig> was presented previously in a conference proceeding document  <cit> . a hydropathy plot  <cit>  of the deduced amino acid sequence of bndgat <dig>  <cit>  indicated that the n-terminal region of the enzyme was relatively hydrophilic compared to the rest of the protein. based on this information, we designed a construct which would result in the production of a gene product consisting of the first  <dig> amino acid residues of bndgat <dig> followed by a four amino acid residue  linker and  <dig> his residues. automated dna sequencing was performed across the cloning junctions and for the entire coding region, to verify there was no shift in the open reading frame. induction of bndgat1his <dig> synthesis by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside  treatment of bacteria is shown in figure 1a. analysis of lysates from induced escherichia coli  clearly showed the appearance of an abundant polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of about  <dig> kda, which was considerably larger than the calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  da for bndgat1his <dig>  the  <dig> kda band was barely perceptible in the pellet protein , indicating that the expressed gene product was soluble in the extraction buffer. the poly-his tag on bndgat1his <dig> facilitated effective purification of the recombinant n-terminal fragment by immobilized nickel ion chromatography. analysis of different elution fractions of the ni2+-nta-agarose column by sds-page is depicted in figure 1b. the protein fraction that was eluted with  <dig> mm imidazole was highly purified based on sds-page  and thus was used for subsequent characterization work. analysis of purified bndgat1his <dig> by maldi-tof mass spectrometry indicated a molecular mass of about  <dig>  kda, which was in close agreement with the calculated molecular mass . analysis of bndgat1his <dig> by dynamic light scattering  indicated that the protein preparation was largely monodisperse and potentially suitable for crystallization. small plate-like monoclinic crystals were grown from preparations of purified bndgat1his <dig> . the largest microcrystals, however, were too small  for x-ray diffraction studies using a rotating anode x-ray source.

bndgat1his <dig> interacts with long chain acyl-coas in a cooperative fashion
in a previous study, we demonstrated that oleoyl-coa interacted with bndgat1his <dig> using a low concentration range  of thioester  <cit> . in the current study, the range of thioester concentrations used in lipidex- <dig> binding assays was extended up to near  <dig> μm for oleoyl-coa . as well, binding studies were conducted with erucoyl-coa for comparative purposes. binding experiments with bsa, which is known to interact with acyl-coas  <cit> , demonstrated that the lipidex- <dig> assay was effective and thus served as a positive control . in contrast, we have previously shown that ovalbumin does not bind acyl-coa using this assay  <cit> . the binding of both acyl-coa species to bndgat1his <dig> occurred in a sigmoidal fashion. the binding ratio of thioester: bndgat1his <dig> was based on the molecular mass of  <dig>  da calculated from the amino acid sequence of the n-terminal fragment. bndgat1his <dig> bound more erucoyl-coa than oleoyl-coa at considerably lower concentrations of acyl-coa indicating that the n-terminal fragment had a greater affinity for erucoyl-coa than oleoyl-coa. analysis of the binding data using scatchard plots  <cit>  is depicted in figures 2c and 2d. both plots rose to a maximum and then decreased suggesting that the interaction between acyl-coa and bndgat1his <dig> involved positive cooperativity. dissociation constants of about  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm were determined for the binding of oleoyl-coa and erucoyl-coa, respectively, to the high affinity state of bndgat1his <dig>  the dissociation constants were determined using the data points constituting the negative slopes of the scatchard plots.

a lipidex- <dig> competition binding study was conducted by introducing unlabeled compounds into a binding medium containing  <dig> μm oleoyl-coa. test compounds included  <dig> μm free coa and  <dig> μm oleoyl-coa. a previous study indicated that micromolar concentrations of coa were effective in stimulating microsomal dgat activity from microspore-derived cell suspension cultures of oilseed rape  <cit> , so it seemed logical to test the possible effect of these compounds on the binding of thioester. the presence of either free coa or oleoyl-coa was effective in displacing a similar quantity of radiolabeled ligand from bndgat1his <dig> .

additional evidence for the interaction of bndgat1his <dig> with acyl-coa was obtained using non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. when the fragment was preincubated with an equimolar concentration of radiolabeled erucoyl-coa followed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging, radiolabel was extended to the position of bndgat1his <dig> in the gel . the rather broad band seen in the protein stain  suggested the presence of at least two closely associated polypeptides, which probably represent different association states of bndgat1his <dig> .

bndgat1his <dig> self-associates
analysis of the molecular mass of bndgat1his <dig> under non-denaturing conditions was conducted using gel filtration chromatography of clarified lysate of ruptured bacteria expressing the n-terminal fragment . analysis of protein in the fractions eluting from the column by sds-page indicated that bndgat1his <dig> eluted between the elution positions of carbonic anhydrase  and bsa .

chemical cross-linking of bndgat1his <dig> was conducted using dimethylsuberimidate  to further probe the self-associating properties of bndgat1his <dig>  species generated by chemical cross-linking were resolved by sds-page and visualized by western blotting using polyclonal antibodies which recognized an epitope in residues 21– <dig> in the n-terminal region of the polypeptide . the control lane  of the western blot exhibited immunoreactive proteins with apparent molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively. the putative  <dig> kda dimer could not be visualized by coomassie blue staining suggesting that the immunoreactivity of the dimer was considerably greater than that of the monomer. treatment of bndgat1his <dig> with chemical cross-linking agent, however, resulted in the clear visualization of an additional band with molecular mass of  <dig> kda , which may represent tetramer, and an enhancement in the amount of putative  <dig> kda dimer. the tetramer was also not visible in coomassie blue-stained gels. a very faint immunoreactive band of  <dig> kda was also present at this position in lane  <dig> 

the n-terminal region of bndgat <dig> is localized to the cytosolic side of the er
four different computer programs  for assessing the topology of membrane-bound proteins indicated that the hydrophilic n-terminal segment of bndgat <dig> resided on the cytosolic face of the er. an immunochemical approach was used to provide experimental evidence for the location of the hydrophilic n-terminal segment of bndgat <dig> in microsomal vesicles. polyclonal antibodies raised against a chemically synthesized amino acid sequence representing the peptide segment 21-ldrlhrrksssdssn- <dig> within bndgat <dig> recognized a  <dig> kda polypeptide in sds-solubilized microsomes . this molecular mass was in close agreement with the molecular mass of  <dig>  kda calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of bndgat <dig>  <cit> . pre-treatment of microsomes with proteinase k, however, resulted in the loss of signal for bndgat <dig> on the western blot  suggesting that the n-terminal segment of the enzyme was digested by the proteinase in microsomal vesicles. this experiment confirmed the cytosolic location of the n-terminal segment of bndgat <dig> 

discussion
most of the information about the relationship between structure and function in type  <dig> dgat is based on inferences made about proposed functional regions in the enzyme that have been defined by molecular signatures in the sequence data. a detailed 3-dimensional picture of dgat <dig> is, however, dependent on the availability of purified enzyme for either crystallization/x-ray diffraction and/or nmr evaluation of structure. although the type  <dig> enzyme has been cloned from several sources, the multiple transmembrane segments probably imparted hydrophobicity problems which have impeded purification of the enzyme  <cit> . in order to gain some insight into structure/function in dgat <dig>  we generated a poly-his-tagged fragment representing the hydrophilic n-terminal segment of the enzyme from b. napus. attempts to induce the synthesis of the entire poly-his-tagged enzyme in e. coli were unsuccessful. the fact that bndgat1his <dig> displayed an anomalously high molecular mass during sds-page might be related to an unusual conformation for the polypeptide and/or deviation in the degree of sds-binding by the polypeptide following thermal denaturation in the presence of sds. anomalous behavior during sds-page has been reported for many other proteins  <cit>  the ability to crystallize bndgat1his <dig> has set the foundation for future studies of the structure of this fragment. the very fact that a portion of dgat <dig> was crystallized represents a major advance in the study of this enzyme.

the binding of acyl-coa to bndgat1his <dig> is consistent with the presence of an acyl-coa binding signature  in the n-terminal region of bndgat <dig>  <cit> . this signature is also present in other type  <dig> plant dgats  <cit>  suggesting that this region may have a common role. the sigmoidal response observed for the binding of acyl-coas was not likely an artifact of polyhis-tagging because studies with polyhis-tagged acyl-coa binding proteins from arabidopsis have demonstrated typical hyperbolic saturation in binding studies with radiolabeled acyl-coas  <cit> . the hydrophilic n-terminal region of bndgat <dig> would likely interact with the cytosolic acyl-coa pool because both transmembrane prediction programs and proteinase k-protection experiments determined that this region was located to the cytosolic side of the er. the acyl-coa binding site in the n-terminal region of bndgat <dig> is probably not the active site of the enzyme. bndgat <dig> does not contain the hydrophilic n-terminus present in bndgat <dig>  <cit> . thus, the absence of the acyl-coa binding site in bndgat <dig> suggests that amino residues involved in catalysis are common to both bndgat <dig> and bndgat <dig> because cdnas encoding both of these enzymes were functionally expressed in yeast  <cit> . the acyl-coa binding site in the n-terminal segment of bndgat <dig> might represent a regulatory motif on the enzyme or, conversely, a site for trapping cytosolic acyl-coa for eventual use by the catalytic site. substantial binding of thioester occurred in the range of  <dig> –  <dig> μm acyl-coa, which is the estimated physiological concentration range of the acyl-coa pool in developing zygotic embryos of b. napus  <cit> . the binding of acyl-coa by bndgat1his <dig> occurs over similar concentrations of thioester observed in substrate saturation curves for microsomal dgat activity from microspore-derived embryos  <cit>  and cell suspension cultures  <cit>  of b. napus. as well, the affinity  of bndgat1his <dig> for acyl-coa is in the same order of magnitude as has been reported for a soluble recombinant acyl-coa binding protein from developing seeds of b. napus  <cit> . it has been proposed that acyl-coa binding proteins might modulate acyltransferase activity, perhaps by affecting the delivery of thioester to the enzyme  <cit> .

the competition study involving the introduction of unlabeled coa or oleoyl-coa into a mixture containing radiolabeled oleoyl-coa suggests that the coa component of the thioester has a major role in determining binding. coa has previously been shown to enhance dgat activity in microsomes from microspore-derived cell suspension cultures of b. napus  <cit> . the effect of free coa in displacing oleoyl-coa suggests that coa might act as a negative effector of acyl-coa action within the n-terminal region of bndgat <dig>  although the thioester interacted with the bndgat <dig> fragment in a cooperative fashion, this study has not linked the binding process to the status of bndgat <dig> activity. therefore, the relative roles of acyl-coa and free coa, potentially regulating bndgat <dig> activity, remain to be elucidated. furthermore, it is important to note that the effects of coa on dgat activity in b. napus cultures observed by byers et al.  <cit>  were based on experiments with microsomes, which may have contained a mixture of type- <dig> and type- <dig> dgat activity, making it difficult to ascribe the stimulatory effect of coa solely to bndgat <dig> activity. the difference in the binding affinity of oleoyl-coa versus erucoyl-coa shown in figures 2a and 2b indicates that the nature of the fatty acyl moiety is also very important in determining the extent and affinity of binding. different species of cytosolic acyl-coa, at various concentrations, might differentially affect the performance of bndgat <dig> in the er, and this may be further complicated by endogenous coa concentration. a direct link between the binding events observed for bndgat1his <dig> and catalysis within the functionally active full-length bndgat <dig> will require modification of the putative regulatory site through site-directed mutagenesis.

collectively, gel filtration chromatography and chemical cross-linking data indicated that bndgat1his <dig> self-associated under non-denaturing conditions. the calculated molecular mass of about  <dig> kda for the tetrameric form of bndgat1his <dig> was in agreement with the fragment eluting between  <dig> and  <dig> kda during gel filtration chromatography under non-denaturing conditions. the fact that some putative dimer could be readily detected following sds-page suggests that a proportion of bndgat1his <dig> retains some native conformation following thermal denaturation in the presence of sds and reducing agent. indeed, persistent residual structure in the monomer of human papillomavirus e <dig> oncoprotein following thermal denaturation in the presence of sds has been shown to result in anomalous electrophoretic behavior for this protein during sds-page  <cit> . the self-association of bndgat1his <dig> is particularly revealing in the light of recent findings which have indicated that both human dgat <dig>  <cit>  and mammalian acat <dig>  <cit>  are tetrameric proteins. the n-terminal regions of these mammalian acyltransferases have been shown to play a critical role in the formation of tetramers. mutations of human dgat <dig> devoid of the last  <dig> amino acid residues from the c-terminus  were shown to be catalytically inactive  <cit> . dgatsv, however, formed dimers and tetramers in chemical cross-linking experiments indicating that the ability to form tetramers resided in the n-terminal region. mutagenesis studies of an acat-related enzyme in yeast, known as are2p, have provided valuable insights into the structure/function properties of this enzyme  <cit> . deletion, truncation and missense mutations implicated a regulatory role for the n-terminal domain of are2p. the self-associating properties of bndgat <dig> also support the cooperative binding behavior observed in the acyl-coa binding studies; typically, communication between subunits is required to achieve cooperativity. thus, the effect of acyl-coa concentration and species on the self-association of bndgat <dig> would represent an important line of investigation for the future.

CONCLUSIONS
as a first step in deciphering the structure/function relationships in dgat <dig>  we have examined the properties of a soluble n-terminal fragment of the enzyme from oilseed rape. we have demonstrated experimentally that the recombinant  <dig>  kda n-terminal fragment binds acyl-coa in a cooperative fashion. in addition, we have shown that this fragment is capable of self-associating to form a putative dimer and tetramer. the ability to crystallize this fragment represents a major advance in the further characterization of this important membrane-bound enzyme.
