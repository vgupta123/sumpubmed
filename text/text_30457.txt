BACKGROUND
the canine transmissible venereal tumour  is a naturally occurring transmissible cancer which is spread between dogs by the allogeneic transfer of living cancer cells. the disease is usually transmitted during coitus  <cit> - <cit>  and results in the appearance of tumours most often associated with the external genitalia of male and female dogs . ctvt has been reported in many countries around the world  and is, to our knowledge, the oldest and most prolific mammalian somatic cell lineage  <cit> - <cit> .

genetic evidence suggests that ctvt first arose from the somatic cells of an individual dog that lived several thousand years ago  <cit> - <cit> . despite its ancient origin, global populations of ctvt diverged only within the last few hundred years  <cit> - <cit> , suggesting that ctvt spread around the globe relatively recently. despite numerous historical and contemporary reports of the disease , no systematic study of ctvt’s distribution and prevalence has been performed. estimating the worldwide distribution and prevalence of a common animal pathogen such as ctvt is a challenging task  <cit> - <cit> ; in most countries the disease is not considered notifiable, and in many areas animals do not have access to veterinary care. veterinary records are often scant or inconsistent, and variation in ctvt prevalence may exist within countries due to seasonal, demographic or geographic factors. here, we used a crowdsourcing approach to estimate ctvt’s distribution and prevalence by using the internet to contact and source local ctvt prevalence estimates from  <dig> veterinarians and animal health workers worldwide. we show that the disease’s prevalence is linked to national development status and that dog management policies leading to declines in the population of free-roaming dogs may have caused its recent eradication from the united kingdom. further insight into the epidemiology of ctvt may help elucidate the timing, route and manner of the disease’s global spread. in addition, an understanding of the factors influencing ctvt distribution and prevalence may inform policy decisions for ctvt control.

RESULTS
historical worldwide ctvt distribution
we initially analysed the published literature in order to understand the historical distribution of ctvt. we found  <dig> reports of primary naturally occurring ctvt cases in the published literature , including case reports, experimental reports and retrospective studies. these records provide evidence of ctvt on all six inhabited continents and range in date from  <dig> until the present time . the earliest known record of ctvt is from london in  <dig>  where it was noted as one of only two cancers known to afflict dogs  <cit> . we found evidence that ctvt was present prior to  <dig> in the united states  <cit> , <cit> , france  <cit> , germany  <cit> - <cit> , italy  <cit> , the united kingdom  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> , japan  <cit>  and papua new guinea  <cit> . a  <dig> report from papua new guinea stated that ctvt was “endemic before the advent of the white man”  <cit> . two reports published in the 1950s noted declines in ctvt prevalence, stating that ctvt occurs “less commonly in london dogs”   <cit>  and that there has been a “reduction in incidence” of ctvt in new york city   <cit> . indeed, our literature review documented a clear decline in ctvt in the united kingdom during the twentieth century .

eighteen of the published reports provided a numerical value for the prevalence of naturally occurring ctvt in their study . the reported prevalence of ctvt in affected populations ranged from 1% or less  to almost 20% .

current worldwide ctvt distribution
we designed and distributed an internet-based questionnaire with  <dig> predominantly multiple choice questions regarding ctvt prevalence, features of ctvt-infected dogs and conditions of local dog populations to more than one thousand veterinarians and animal health workers in  <dig> countries . respondents were asked to estimate the prevalence of ctvt in their local area. we received a total of  <dig> completed questionnaires from  <dig> countries.

the average estimated ctvt prevalence reported for each country from which a minimum of three responses were received is displayed in figure 2a . in addition, a separate map displays each individual respondent’s estimate of ctvt prevalence . the data indicate that ctvt is estimated to occur at between one and ten percent prevalence in dogs in most countries in south and central america as well as in parts of africa and asia. the average reported prevalence by continent is shown in figure 2b. the highest estimated ctvt prevalence that we recorded was in belize, where the average ctvt prevalence  was estimated to be between  <dig> and  <dig> percent. several countries  were consistently reported by all respondents from that country to be free of endemic ctvt; in these countries, the only ctvt cases were specifically reported to be imported from abroad . ctvt was reported as absent from many regions of the united states and australia, but was present in remote indigenous communities, including indian reservations in arizona and north dakota, as well as in australian aboriginal communities in the northern territory and western australia . there was also geographical variation in estimated ctvt prevalence in europe; the disease was reported to be absent except for occasional imported cases in many countries of northern and western europe, but was estimated to be present at less than ten percent prevalence in countries in southern and eastern europe .

status of dogs with ctvt
we asked questionnaire respondents to report the most likely gender and health status of animals with ctvt. despite previous suggestions that ctvt is more common in males  <cit> , <cit>  or females  <cit> - <cit> , responses to the questionnaire indicated that there is no universal gender bias for ctvt infection, with  <dig> respondents reporting that ctvt was more common in males,  <dig> reporting that it was more common in females and  <dig> claiming that it was equally common in both sexes  . the majority of respondents  claimed that dogs with ctvt were otherwise healthy rather than infected with parasites or otherwise diseased, thin or emaciated, or carrying injuries or bite marks . we investigated the association of spaying/neutering with ctvt presence by asking respondents whether the majority of dogs in their country are spayed/neutered or entire. the responses showed that higher estimated ctvt prevalence coincides with higher percentage of respondents claiming that the majority of dogs are entire rather than spayed or neutered .

despite previous reports of successful experimental transmission of ctvt into wild canids, including wolves, coyotes and red foxes  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> , no naturally occurring ctvt case has been previously reported in a wild canid. we further investigated this by asking all questionnaire respondents if they had observed ctvt in a wild canid . the responses did not reveal any confirmed reports of ctvt in wild canid populations.

factors influencing ctvt prevalence
we next stratified countries based on income economy  and found strikingly lower estimated prevalence of ctvt in countries with high income economies, compared with those with low, lower-middle and upper-middle income economies, which had similar distributions of estimated ctvt prevalence . the proportion of countries with reported presence of free-roaming dogs was also associated with income economy category , presenting the possibility that differences in presence of free-roaming dogs may explain the link between ctvt prevalence and national development status.

additionally, we observed a weak negative correlation between average reported ctvt prevalence and socio-economic status, determined by gross domestic product  per capita value for each country , together with a weak negative correlation between average reported ctvt prevalence and distance from the equator, as measured by distance from the equator to the capital city of each country . it is possible, however, that these correlations, as well as a previously identified correlation between ctvt prevalence and distance from the equator within the united states  <cit> , may be explained by the presence of free-roaming dogs.

metastasis and treatment of ctvt
ctvt metastasis has been previously noted in individual case reports  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . we asked questionnaire respondents to estimate the proportion of ctvt cases in which metastasis is observed. of the six categorical intervals available to respondents , the majority of respondents estimated that metastasis occurs in 0– <dig> percent of ctvt cases , consistent with previously published estimates  <cit> , <cit> . additionally, we recorded the most commonly observed sites of metastasis reported by questionnaire respondents .

vincristine is known to be a very effective treatment for ctvt  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . we asked respondents to report the type and effectiveness of treatments they typically administer for ctvt . the majority of respondents  reported that they use either vincristine alone or vincristine in combination with surgery, doxorubicine or radiotherapy. a proportion of respondents  reported that they used surgery alone or other non-vincristine treatments . thirteen  respondents stated that the only option is euthanasia. those who used vincristine treatment for ctvt reported that  <dig> to  <dig> percent of tumours usually went into complete remission after treatment , however the number of vincristine doses claimed to be required for complete remission varied between respondents. this contrasted with the poor reported effectiveness of surgery alone or other non-vincristine treatments .

discussion
this survey of current and historical ctvt distribution patterns confirms that ctvt was and remains a very common canine infectious disease throughout the world. the global ctvt prevalence data reported in this study are individual estimates of local ctvt prevalence and are thus subject to errors introduced by variation in methodologies used by respondents to estimate prevalence . difficulties in prevalence estimation may have been further confounded by a combination of absent, inconsistent or incomplete record keeping, personal biases as well as systematic biases introduced where the sampling population was not representative of the population as a whole. furthermore, variation in ctvt prevalence due to seasonal, demographic or local geographical factors may not have been captured by our approach. in order to minimise the effects of estimate biases on our analysis, we only included data from countries from which we received at least three responses in figure 2a and figure  <dig>  despite the limitations associated with estimating global ctvt prevalence, our large sample size supports the conclusion that a strikingly large proportion of the global dog population harbours ctvt infection at a prevalence of between  <dig>  and  <dig> percent. future studies will be important to further validate global variation in ctvt prevalence.

we have documented the decline and disappearance of ctvt from the united kingdom during the twentieth century . the eradication of ctvt from the united kingdom may be due to the introduction of a series of dog management laws throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . the dogs act,  <dig>  <cit>  imposed civil responsibility on dog owners and stated that dogs must be “under proper control” and “stray dogs may be detained and sold or destroyed”. this was followed by the dogs act  <dig>  <cit> , amended in  <dig> and  <dig>  which introduced a requirement to report stray dogs to the police. it is striking that the eradication of ctvt, once a common canine pathogen in the united kingdom , appears to have occurred as an unintentional result of human intervention.

the importance of dog management and spaying/neutering in ctvt control was highlighted by a respondent from koh phangan island, thailand, where breeding control and sterilisation campaigns have almost eradicated ctvt from the island since the commencement of the sterilisation project in  <dig>  several respondents, however, when asked to comment on any unusual cases of ctvt that they had seen, commented that they had observed ctvt in dogs years after spay or neuter surgery. this suggests that either the latent period for ctvt development, which previous anecdotal reports have suggested may last for weeks or months  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , can sometimes last years, or, alternatively, that spaying and neutering does not always protect dogs from ctvt. furthermore, non-coital modes of ctvt transmission, including biting, licking or sniffing, may also contribute to ctvt infection of spayed/neutered dogs  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> .

despite the widespread presence of ctvt in dog populations worldwide, the results of our survey indicate that its prevalence rarely rises above 10% . this contrasts with epidemiological patterns observed for the only other known naturally occurring transmissible cancer, the tasmanian devil facial tumour disease . prevalence of dftd usually rises above 50% in affected tasmanian devil populations and the disease usually triggers a rapid population decline . given that the mixed mating system of dogs would promote widespread exposure to the disease  <cit> , this pattern suggests that only a proportion of the dog population may be susceptible to ctvt at any one time and, possibly, as one early report of ctvt proposed, that “some animals are naturally refractory” to infection  <cit> . future studies of ctvt exposure and susceptibility in free-roaming dog populations may reveal further insights into the biological basis of this interesting observation.

genetic studies indicate that the global spread of ctvt has occurred relatively recently in the history of the lineage, probably within the last 500 years  <cit> - <cit> . although we do not know the location in which ctvt first emerged, our study has highlighted the remarkable efficiency with which ctvt has colonised its global host population. we obtained evidence for ctvt’s presence in some of the world’s most isolated communities and islands, including the solomon islands, samoa, american samoa, fiji, reunion, mauritius and several islands in micronesia. in contrast, new zealand is free of ctvt, likely due to its rigorous import quarantine rules  <cit> . together, these findings highlight the mobility of dogs, which, alongside humans, have travelled rapidly and extensively around the globe.

this study has provided information on historical and current ctvt global distribution and prevalence and has illuminated a number of factors which may influence ctvt prevalence, including presence of free-roaming dogs, dog spay/neuter practices and enforcement of dog control laws. in addition to providing insight into the global spread of a unique type of pathogen, this study may assist policy-makers and veterinarians in the development of measures to more effectively control and reduce ctvt prevalence and prevent further spread of the disease.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a survey of the current global distribution of ctvt, confirming that ctvt is endemic in at least  <dig> countries worldwide. additionally, our analysis highlighted factors that continue to modify ctvt’s prevalence around the world; free-roaming dogs were implicated as a reservoir for the disease and spaying and neutering were associated with lower ctvt prevalence. our analysis also documents the disappearance of the disease from the united kingdom during the twentieth century, which may have been an unintentional result of the introduction of dog control policies. in addition to providing insights into the global spread of a unique canine infectious disease, this study may assist veterinarians and policy-makers to develop measures to more effectively control and reduce ctvt prevalence and spread.
