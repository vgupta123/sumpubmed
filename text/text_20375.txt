BACKGROUND
in plants, small rnas have been widely implicated in varied developmental events and as guide rnas in many gene silencing pathways  <cit> . these rnas are usually generated by the activities of dicers, argonautes and rna-dependent rna polymerases , which are also sometimes referred to as the core proteins mediating rna interference. these proteins are involved in the initiation and maintenance of the trigger rna that is central to this mode of gene regulation. briefly, initiation of gene silencing involves generation of double stranded rna  by several mechanisms, for example, bidirectional transcription of dna, self-complementary rna foldbacks or rna-dependent transcription of aberrantly synthesized mrnas  <cit> . the complementary dsrnas are then processed by the rnaseiii-type activities of dicers into small rnas, ~19– <dig> nucleotides in length . generally, one strand of these rnas then associates with the silencing effector complexes through the argonaute proteins. this confers sequence-specific guide functions to these complexes that find target rnas with sequences complementary to the small rnas. silencing/repression of the target genes then occurs by either blocking translation or cleavage of the target mrna. these small rnas could also mediate transcriptional gene silencing by recruitment of histone and/or dna methyltransferases to regulatory sequences of the target genes  <cit> .

dicers and argonautes are multidomain ribonucleases. dicers are characterized by the presence of six types of domains, viz., dexd-helicase, helicase-c, duf <dig>  paz, rnaseiii and double stranded rna-binding  domain  <cit> . all argonaute proteins share the domain structure that comprises of an n terminal, paz, mid and a c-terminal piwi domain. the paz domain  facilitates binding of 3' end of sirna, while, the piwi domain binds the 5' end of sirna and to the target rna. this domain has marked similarity with rnaseh family of ribonucleases and it possesses the catalytic amino acid residues required for endonucleolytic cleavage of the target rna  <cit> . at least three subfamilies of argonaute proteins have been identified in eukaryotes  <cit> . these include the ago subfamily that is present in plants, animals and yeasts; the piwi subfamily that has been found only in animals and the worm-specific argonaute  subfamily that are present in c. elegans  <cit> . members of both ago and piwi subfamilies possess the characteristic ddh metal binding signature residues in their piwi domains, while most of the wago proteins lack them. the piwi proteins are expressed specifically in the germline cells and are known to interact with a subset of small rna called piwi-interacting rna that are longer  than sirna and mirna   <cit> . this clade of argonaute proteins have not been identified in any plant species. recently, however, a novel kind of argonaute, osmel <dig> has been described in rice that is involved specifically in male meiosis  <cit> . rna-dependent rna polymerase was first isolated from tomato  <cit> . these proteins are required for initiation and amplification of silencing signal and they possess a conserved sequence motif that resembles the catalytic β' subunit of dna-dependent rna polymerases  <cit> .

multiple copies of dicers, argonautes and rdr genes are known to exist in both plants and animals. with the exception of fission yeast  that codes for only one copy each of the dicer, the argonaute and the rdr, these proteins are encoded by multigene families in insects, nematodes, mammals and plants  <cit> . in arabidopsis,  <dig> dicer-like ,  <dig> argonautes and  <dig> rdr genes have been identified. functions of few of these genes have also been elucidated. arabidopsis dicer-like  <dig> , but not dcl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  has been implicated in biogenesis of mirna  <cit> . argonaute <dig>  regulates floral meristem and organ identity by affecting expression of leafy, apetala <dig> and agamous genes. it also affects expression of the polycomb group protein, curlyleaf  that maintains repression of both knox and agamous in vegetative organs  <cit> . in drosophila, dicer- <dig>  has been found to be essential for mirna formation and it functions redundantly with dcr- <dig> downstream of sirna production. dcr- <dig>  on the other hand, has also been implicated in sirna formation  <cit> . in neurospora crassa, distinct rdr and argonaute proteins are required for meiotic silencing of unpaired dna  and rnai . in caenorhabditis elegans, the  <dig> nucleotide endogenous mirna encoded by lin- <dig> and let- <dig> genes are processed by dcr- <dig> and these small rnas regulate lin- <dig> and lin- <dig> linked timing of developmental stages in the nematode life cycle  <cit> .

in rice, components of the rnai machinery are known to be involved in maintenance of undifferentiated cells in shoot apical meristem , initiation of lateral organ primodia from sam and floral meristems and formation of male and female germ cells  <cit> . the present investigation has been carried out with the aim to obtain comprehensive expression overview of all the members of rice dicer-like, argonaute and rdr gene families to gain insight into the domains of activity of these genes and to provide a firm foundation for further, more detailed investigations aimed at understanding the contribution of individual components of rna silencing machinery in regulating gene expression during reproductive development of plants. for this, an in-house generated  rice microarray data set comprising of  <dig> stages of vegetative and reproductive development, along with  <dig> newly added tissues/developmental stages corresponding to y-leaf, sam and three very early stages of panicle initiation, was utilized. where possible, the expression profiles of rice genes have been compared with those in arabidopsis at similar stages of flower and seed development to identify genes with similar expression profiles in dicots.

RESULTS
identification and structural organization of rice dicer-like, argonaute and rdr genes
name search using the keywords, dicer, paz, piwi, argonaute and rna-dependent rna polymerase and hmm analysis resulted in the identification of  <dig> genes encoding dicer-like  proteins,  <dig> for argonautes  and  <dig> genes for rdr  in the rice genome . besides confirming the previously identified gene members, this exercise revealed two additional osdcl and one argonaute encoding loci  <cit> . the newly identified dicer-like loci are loc_os05g <dig>  and loc_os06g <dig>  with coding potential of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid polypeptides, respectively . protein evidence for only loc_os06g <dig> was found in the swiss-prot/trembl database . search for the conserved domains by simple modular architecture research tool  analysis and in ncbi databases revealed the presence of only rnaseiii and dsrb domains in these proteins, while in most other osdcls, dexd, helicase-c, duf <dig>  paz, rnaseiii and dsrb domains, characteristic of plant dcl proteins, were present. osdcl2b, however, lacked the duf <dig> domain and both osdcl2a and 2b lacked one of the dsrb domains, as reported previously  <cit> . maximum number of introns,  <dig> in number, was found in osdcl3a that codes for a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide.

of the  <dig> argonautes identified in rice in the present study,  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively, were reported recently  <cit> . the additional osago  identified in this study, corresponds to the locus loc_os04g <dig> and is characterized by the presence paz and piwi domains in the putative polypeptide sequence. all osagos code for ~ <dig> kda basic proteins with pi ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  the osagos are characterized by the presence of paz domain  towards the amino terminus and piwi domain  at the carboxyl end. as an exception, osago <dig> was found to code for only the piwi domain . osago <dig>  is characterized by the longest open reading frame of  <dig> bp with a coding potential for a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide. this protein has been annotated as a retrotransposon protein in tigr release  <dig>  however, it possesses the argonaute-specific paz and piwi domains besides the duf, intergrase core domain  and the reverse transcriptase  domain, characteristic of mobile elements. this gene has also been included as member of the rice argonaute gene family in previous studies  <cit> . structural studies in other organisms have shown that the piwi domain of argonaute proteins folds similar to rnaseh proteins. consistent with this observation, some argonaute proteins in both plants and animals are known to cleave the target rnas that have sequence complementary to the small rnas  <cit> . these catalytic proteins are known to possess three conserved metal chelating residues in the piwi domain i.e. aspartate, aspartate and histidine , that function as the catalytic triad. in arabidopsis ago <dig>  a conserved histidine at position  <dig>  was also observed to be critical for the endonuclease activity of ago <dig> in vitro  <cit> . to interrogate which of the osago possessed the conserved catalytic residues and could potentially act as the slicer component of silencing effector complexes, we aligned the piwi domains of all the osagos using clustalx . eight proteins, namely osago1a, osago1b, osago10a, osago10b, osmel <dig>  osago <dig>  ospnh <dig> and osago <dig>  were found to have the conserved ddh/h <dig> residues. in three osagos, the first aspartate was either missing or was replaced by a glycine or histidine. the other six possessed the conserved ddh triad but the histidine at 798th position in ago <dig> was either replaced by serine or a proline . at gene structure level, the number of introns in osago varied from  <dig> in osago <dig> and shl <dig> to  <dig> in osago1a, osago1b, osago1c and osago1d .

all the  <dig> rdr genes present in the rice genome were found to encode proteins that share a common sequence motif corresponding to the catalytic β' subunit of dna-dependent rna polymerases  <cit> . the length of the open reading frames of osrdrs varied from  <dig> bp for osrdr <dig> to  <dig> bp for shl <dig>  with the coding potential of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. interestingly, the genomic sequence of shl <dig> that encodes the longest open reading frame is interrupted by a single intron, while osrdr <dig> that encodes the second longest open reading frame of  <dig> bp has  <dig> intervening sequences as annotated in tigr .

phylogeny and chromosomal localization
to determine evolutionary relatedness of rice argonautes, rdrs and dcls with those from mammals, drosophila, caenorhabditis elegans, schizosaccharomyces pombe and arabidopsis, total protein sequences from these organisms were used to construct an unrooted neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree . rice and arabidopsis ago genes clustered into four subgroups, mel <dig>  ago <dig>  ago <dig> and zippy , similar to those described by nonomura et al. . in ago <dig> subgroup, four rice genes grouped with single arabidopsis gene ago <dig> that is closely related to ago10/pnh. these genes have been designated as osago1a, osago1b, osago1c and osago1d on the basis of high sequence similarity to ago <dig> and similar gene expression profiles to the arabidopsis gene . the mel <dig> group contains five rice genes including osmel <dig> and the only arabidopsis gene ago <dig>  comparison of full-length osago proteins of this clade revealed that these proteins shared  <dig> – 60% overall identity but their piwi domains had  <dig> – 94% similar residues. since only ago <dig> and osmel <dig> exhibit similar expression profiles, other genes in this clade have been named osago11- <dig>  in the ago <dig> subgroup, two highly similar rice members, loc_os04g <dig> and loc_os01g <dig> have been named osago4a and osago4b as they share greater similarity with ago <dig>  in comparison to ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig>  the animal argonautes, on the other hand, are grouped into two distinct clades a <dig> and a <dig>  the phylogenetic relationship of these groups suggests that the plant ago <dig> and mel <dig> clades had a common lineage with a <dig>  while zippy and ago <dig> clades may have diverged from an ancestral lineage that gave rise to a <dig> clade in animals.

phylogenetic analysis of rice, arabidopsis, zea mays, populus trichocarpa, c. elegans and schizosaccharomyces pombe rdr genes revealed that dicot and monocot rdr genes cluster into four clades, i, ii, iii and iv . members in each clade show monophyletic pattern of origin. the rice rdr genes have been named as osrdr <dig> to  <dig> on the basis of sequence similarity with the corresponding proteins in arabidopsis. loc_os01g <dig> was named osrdr <dig> and loc_os01g <dig> has been named osrdr <dig> on the basis of phylogeny and the results of homology scores of the rice genes with the corresponding arabidopsis rdr <dig> and rdr <dig> genes in blast searches . the rdr genes of c. elegans also originated from a common ancestral gene that diverged from the clades that gave rise to plant and the single yeast gene.

plant dcl genes form a monophyletic group with osdcl genes showing high sequence conservation with their counterparts in arabidopsis . dicers from drosophila , nematode and humans form one group that is distinct from drosophila dicer <dig> and the only dicer from s. pombe due to absence of the conserved paz domain in these proteins . the newly identified osdcl loci closely grouped with the highly similar atdcl <dig> and osdcl <dig>  similar associations were observed when only dsrba domains of rice and arabidopsis proteins were used to construct a phylogenetic tree . therefore, we have renamed osdcl <dig> as osdcl1a, and named the two new loci as osdcl1b and osdcl1c .

to gain insight into the evolution of multiple agos, rdrs and dcls in rice, we analyzed their genomic distribution by localizing the genes on rice chromosomes . two pairs of rice argonautes, osago14-osmel <dig> and osago1a-osago1b, appear to have originated due to segmental duplications in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. osago <dig> was located close to osmel <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  which has the maximum number of  <dig> genes, while the rest of the osago were distributed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . localization of osrdr on rice chromosomes showed  <dig> genes, osrdr <dig>  osrdr <dig> and shl <dig> on chromosome  <dig> while chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> had osrdr <dig> and osrdr <dig>  respectively . none of these genes were found to be located in duplicated segments of the genome.

the osdcl genes were distributed on  <dig> chromosomes . except chromosome  <dig> that contains osdcl <dig> and osdcl2a, all the other chromosomes  have single representative of osdcl. when these data were superimposed with those for segmental duplications , osdcl2a and osdcl2b were found to lie in duplicated regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  it has been previously shown that at amino acid levels too, these two paralogs share 99% similarity while at the genomic level these genes differ by a  <dig> bp deletion within an intron and deletion of a part of duf domain in osdcl2b  <cit> . osdcl1a, osdcl1b and osdcl1c that share significant homology were localized on regions of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which are not included in segmental duplication database, suggesting that events other than large segmental duplications might be responsible for their evolution. the expressed sequence tags  showing similarity to these rice dicer-like genes are present in zea mays and saccharum officinarum  but not in arabidopsis, thereby suggesting that duplication of osdcl <dig> may have occurred after the divergence of monocots and dicots .

a gene pair was considered tandemly duplicated if the members were separated by less than five intervening genes and shared ≥ 40% sequence similarity at amino acid level. three osago gene pairs,  localized close to each other on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, thus are considered to have arisen due to tandem duplications . they share 55%, 54% and 51% identity at amino acid level between the pair partners. none of the osdcls or osrdrs seems to have undergone tandem duplications.

transcript profiling of genes during vegetative and reproductive development and abiotic stress
to analyze transcript abundance of dicer-like, argonaute and rdr genes at different stages of reproductive development in rice, microarray datasets generated in-house were utilized. the stages of vegetative and reproductive development analyzed in the present study are summarized . microarray hybridization was performed using the 57k affymetrix genechip® rice genome arrays as described previously  <cit> . normalization of data was done using gcrma algorithm and was log <dig> transformed before differential expression analyses were undertaken. in the microarray dataset, >  <dig> % of negative controls and non-rice probe-sets were found to have average signal intensity values less than  <dig>  therefore, the value '15' was considered as the cut off value to distinguish between expressed and non-expressed genes in a particular tissue/developmental stage.

the rice dcl genes osdcl1a, osdcl <dig>  osdcl3a and sho <dig> were found to express ubiquitously  in the tissues/stages of plant development analyzed . these genes expressed at moderate to high levels in vegetative tissues but their expression was markedly reduced during specific stages of reproductive development . specifically, sho <dig>  osdcl1a and osdcl <dig> showed an approximately 10-, 37- and 10-fold down-regulation in late seed development stages  in comparison to their peak expression in young seedlings, y-leaf and sam, respectively . in contrast, two of the low expressing genes, osdcl1b and osdcl3b, exhibited panicle- and early seed-specific expression. the peak expression of osdcl1b was found to be in p <dig> stage  and was ~3-fold higher than its average signal intensity values in vegetative tissues. osdcl3b expressed at ~ <dig> -fold higher levels in p1-ii stage in comparison to its expression in vegetative stages. in vegetative tissues , the average signal intensity values for both these genes were less than  <dig>  like osdcl1a, osdcl <dig>  osdcl3a and sho, three arabidopsis genes, atdcl <dig>  atdcl <dig> and atdcl <dig>  were found to express in all the tissues/stages of development. on the other hand, atdcl <dig>  exhibited specific up-regulation of expression in reproductive stages, while in vegetative stages its expression was barely detectable. none of the osdcl genes showed alteration in expression in response to the three abiotic stress conditions, viz. cold, salt or dehydration .

among osagos,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  were found to express in both vegetative and reproductive tissues  . out of  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes belonging to ago <dig>  ago <dig> and mel <dig> clades , were significantly up-regulated  at the onset of floral development. average signal intensity values of mel <dig> clade genes, osago <dig> and osmel <dig>  were <  <dig> in vegetative tissues as compared to the other genes of ago <dig> and ago <dig> clades. arabidopsis ago <dig> has been shown to express only in reproductive tissues, i.e. during all stages of flower and seed formation  <cit> . this expression pattern is similar to that of osmel <dig> in rice. however, the expression of closely related osago <dig> and osago <dig> overlapped with that of osmel <dig>  individually, osago <dig> expressed significantly in sam and early stages of floral initiation  and osago <dig> expressed in late panicle and early seed development stages . osmel <dig> and osago <dig> share 60% identity at amino acid level and lie in duplicated segments of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . however, their contrasting expression patterns during reproductive development suggest that these two genes have significantly diverged functionally after the duplication event . for the tandemly duplicated pair, osago <dig> and osago <dig>  in this clade, only osago <dig> transcripts could be detected during late panicle  and early seed stages  while transcripts for osago <dig> were barely detectable at any of the stages . in ago <dig> subgroup, there are  <dig> rice genes clustered with two arabidopsis genes, ago <dig> and ago <dig>  unlike their rice counterparts, arabidopsis ago <dig> and ago <dig> expressed in vegetative as well as reproductive tissues without any significant increase in transcript accumulation in reproductive tissues. whereas, all the rice genes in this subgroup exhibited 3- to 36-fold enhancement in transcript levels coinciding with the initiation of reproductive development. expression pattern of the segmentally duplicated genes, osago1a and osago1b, in this clade overlapped at all stages and in all tissues, with osago1b being expressed at relatively higher levels than osago1a . in the zippy clade, expression of tandemly duplicated genes, osago <dig> and osago <dig>  overlapped only during p3–p <dig> stage of panicle development while at all the other stages, only osago <dig> was observed to be highly expressed while, osago <dig> transcripts could not be detected . this shows that both segmental and tandem duplication of argonaute genes have resulted in formation of gene partners that have probably diverged functionally during the course of evolution and have thus contributed to the diversity of this protein family in rice. members of zippy subgroup, shl4/sho <dig> and ago <dig> differed from other members of this clade in being expressed predominantly during early stage of floral development. there are four genes each from rice and arabidopsis that constitute the ago <dig> clade. out of these, the coding region of osago <dig> is interrupted by a retrotransposon. amongst the arabidopsis genes, expression profiles of only ago <dig> and ago <dig> could be obtained. on the basis of transcript accumulation patterns and sequence similarities, the arabidopsis ago <dig> seems to have two counterparts in rice, osago4a and osago4b. these three genes showed enhanced expression during early stages of floral development. the osago4a and osago4b were up-regulated by  <dig>  and  <dig>  folds, while the enhancement was only  <dig>  folds in case of atago <dig>  . conservation in expression profiles was also observed for arabidopsis ago <dig> and osago <dig> genes, whereas, the expression of ago <dig> gene differed in both rice and arabidopsis. atago <dig> expressed specifically during stages of seed development, while expression of osago <dig> was confined to later stages of panicle formation . osago <dig>  that did not cluster into any of the four subgroups exhibited high level expression during late panicle  and seed development stages, s1–s <dig>  along with low level expression in vegetative tissues. for osago <dig>  a unique affymetrix probe set id existed, but no transcripts could be detected in any of the tissues or developmental stages analyzed. most osagos did not show any variation in expression in response to the three abiotic stresses, except osago <dig>  whose transcript levels increased by > 2-folds  in response to all three stresses.

of the five osrdr genes, four expressed both in vegetative and floral tissues with average intensity values of >  <dig> in any or all stages of vegetative, floral- and seed-development . however, a significant increase in the transcript abundance for osrdr <dig>  osrdr <dig> and osrdr <dig>  was observed during stages of early panicle development  in comparison to their expression in mature leaves  . the expression of osrdr <dig> was detectable up to s <dig> stage of seed formation and declined thereafter. the expression profile of the closely related arabidopsis genes, rdr <dig> and rdr <dig>  did not show significant increase in transcript levels as compared to rice genes during early flower development; nevertheless, their transcripts were detectable until early stages of seed development. unlike any other corresponding gene in arabidopsis, the expression of osrdr <dig>  was found to be up-regulated by  <dig> folds in early stages of panicle development in comparison to mature vegetative tissues.

four genes, osago <dig>  osrdr <dig>  osrdr <dig> and osdcl3a, showing discrete expression patterns were selected for validation of microarray expression profiles by qpcr analysis. figure  <dig> shows a comparison of the qpcr and microarray analysis. the expression patterns obtained for all four genes using qpcr were similar to that derived from the microarrays with pearson's correlation values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

discussion
rna interference plays an important role in regulating gene expression at post transcriptional level during vegetative and reproductive development in plants  <cit> . this process is mediated by concerted activities of proteins like, dicers, argonautes and rna-dependent rna polymerases. in the present investigation, we have identified the genes encoding these proteins families in rice and studied their distribution on rice chromosome pseudomolecules. phylogenetic analysis has shed light on the evolution of members in each gene family in rice and has provided insight into multiplicity of argonaute genes in rice. microarray based expression analysis at different stages of reproductive development in rice plants was attempted with the view to understand the contribution and developmental timings of activity of these proteins.

rice dicer-like genes
while there is only one dicer in mammals and nematodes that is involved in processing all sizes of small rnas, four dcl genes found in arabidopsis seem to have specialized in the type of small rnas they process  <cit> . for example, dcl <dig> and dcl <dig> are required for biogenesis of  <dig> nt small rnas that correspond mainly to mirna and tasirna, dcl <dig> affects accumulation of  <dig> nt rna that protects against viral infection and dcl <dig> acts to produce the  <dig> nt rnas that mediate de novo dna methylation, gene silencing and chromatin modification  <cit> . we have identified all four classes of dcl genes in rice, that total eight in number. while duplication of dcl <dig> genes , which share more than 90% similarity at the amino acid level, has also been reported in arabidopsis and populus trichocarpa. however, duplication of dcl <dig> that gave rise to osdcl3a and osdcl3b is considered specific to monocots and predates the divergence of rice and maize  <cit> . in the present study, microarray based expression pattern analysis of rice and arabidopsis dcl genes at different stages of reproductive development shows conservation in expression pattern of genes in dicot and monocot plants, however, duplication events in rice may also have given rise to genes with novel expression  profiles.

null mutants of atdcl <dig> exhibit pleiotropic developmental defects and are lethal due to loss of accumulation of mirnas. henderson et al.  also demonstrated that mirnas dominate the pool of small rnas  accumulated in dcl2/dcl3/dcl <dig> triple mutants  <cit> . in rice too, it has been shown that loss-of-function of osdcl <dig> but not osdcl <dig> affects processing of mirna  <cit> . consistent with the roles of mirnas in regulation of various plant developmental processes, atdcl <dig> was found to express ubiquitously in all tissues. the presence of three dcl <dig> like genes in rice with divergent expression profiles is suggestive of diversification of dcl <dig> function in rice.

atdcl <dig> together with rdr <dig> in arabidopsis is known to affect accumulation of small rnas that mediate de novo dna methylation and transgene silencing. in rice, of the two osdcl3s, osdcl3a was previously considered as the functional counterpart of atdcl <dig> on the basis of overall homology and conservation of dsrbb domain. on the other hand, the dsrbb domain in osdcl3b was so divergent from that of atdcl <dig> that it was suggested to categorize it as an altogether different, fifth class of dicer-like protein  <cit> . atdcl <dig> and osdcl3b show low level expression in vegetative tissues with enhanced transcript accumulation in floral tissues and early stages of seed development. however, osdcl3b expression was confined only to early  stages of panicle development. hence, on the basis of expression profiles atdcl <dig> and osdcl3b share similar expression domains, although the encoded proteins possess highly divergent dsrbb domains and could therefore be interacting with different rna substrates.

arabidopsis dcl <dig> has been shown to function redundantly with dcl <dig> and dcl <dig> to process shl <dig> generated double stranded rna into tasirna the rna template for shl <dig> is in turn produced by the activity of mir <dig> and mir <dig> generated by dcl <dig>  hyl <dig>  hen <dig> and ago <dig>  <cit> . the expression patterns of rice genes, osdcl <dig>  shl <dig> and osago <dig> members  matched that of the corresponding genes in arabidopsis especially in exhibiting enhanced expression during early stages of floral/panicle development. this further suggests that the diversification in function, as speculated from their expression pattern, of most plant dcl genes may have occurred after the split of plants and animal lineages but before the divergence of monocots and dicots.

multiple agos and their roles in rice plant development
argonautes form an evolutionarily conserved gene family whose members are present in both single celled and multicellular eukaryotes. multiple genes have been reported in various organisms. rice has the largest number of argonautes among plants, almost double the number reported in arabidopsis and second only to c. elegans that possesses  <dig> agos  <cit> . rice genes with similar/overlapping expression domains with arabidopsis ago <dig>   ago <dig>  , and ago <dig>  , have been identified in the present study. most of these genes appear to have evolved by duplication events  followed by differentiation of expression patterns. these duplication events may also have given rise to redundancy among osago genes as is evident from the overlapping expression profiles of osago1a, osago1b, osago1c and osago1d and osago4a and osago4b genes. on the other hand, osmel <dig> and osago <dig>  that appear to have arisen by duplication of segments in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  exhibit contrasting expression profiles during panicle and seed development.

argonautes are highly basic rna binding proteins characterized by presence of paz and piwi domains. the piwi domain adopts an rnase-like fold and has predicted endonuclease activity . it binds to 5' end and also interacts with the target rna  <cit> . the paz domain interacts with 3' of small rnas and is the candidate region that determines the specificity of argonautes. consistent with this, homology among various rice agos was observed to be minimum in the paz regions  while their piwi domains exhibited more than 90% conservation of amino acids. the endonuclease property of ago proteins involved in rnai resides in the piwi domain that possesses three conserved metal-chelating amino acids . subfamilies of ago proteins, primary and secondary argonautes, have been described in c. elegans on the basis of presence or absence of these catalytic amino acid residues  <cit> . five of the arabidopsis ago proteins, ago <dig>  ago <dig>  ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> lack either the critical ddh or the h <dig> residue. in rice too, eleven genes do not code for the conserved catalytic residues in their piwi domains. of these, osago <dig>  osago5a, osago5b and osago <dig>  are expressed specifically or preferentially in reproductive tissues. absence of catalytic amino acids could inhibit the processing of target rna by endonucleolytic cleavage in these proteins. these proteins could, therefore, require accessory factors for mediating mrna turnover. however, it has been reported that an aspartate at the third position of the catalytic triad in related rnase proteins, integrase and tn <dig>  can chelate the divalent metal ions as efficiently as histidine residue and restore the catalytic activity  <cit> . accordingly, ago <dig> and ago <dig> of rice and arabidopsis that possess ddd could still function as slicer components of silencing effector complexes. in rice, while osago <dig> is ubiquitously expressed, osago <dig> along with osago <dig>  osago <dig> and osmel <dig> are expressed specifically in reproductive tissues. these genes can, therefore, be considered as candidate genes regulating expression of endogenous genes via rna interference that may or may not involve cleavage of target rna as their mode of activity.

in rice, knockout studies by three groups have provided insights into the functions of three osago genes, osmel <dig>  shl4/sho <dig> and ospnh <dig>  <cit> . osmel <dig> is a unique ago protein that regulates meiosis in germ cells and proper development of male and female gametes by chromatin modification probably mediated by h3k <dig> methylation. whether osmel <dig> directly interacts with regulatory small rnas to bring about desired changes at the chromatin is not yet known. osmel <dig> also has a duplicated partner, osago <dig>  located on chromosome  <dig> that does not show any expression in vegetative tissues and is specifically expressed at stages beginning from p <dig> in panicles and until s <dig> stage in seeds. furthermore, diversity in their paz domains suggests that these two proteins could interact with different classes of small rnas, while retaining the mode of processing the target rna by virtue of the catalytic ddh motif in their piwi domains.

the rice shl <dig>  shl <dig> and sho <dig> genes have been shown to be involved in initiation and formation of sam during rice embryogenesis. this is mediated by mirna and tasirna regulation of homeodomain-leucine zipper  and ett/arf gene families  <cit> . ospnh <dig>  is the third gene whose functional analysis revealed that it affects the development of sam and leaf development  <cit> . this gene is closely related to osago <dig> 

rice rdr genes in panicle development
rna-dependent rna polymerases are the regulatory components of rnai machinery, which enhance the potency of rnai by amplifying the aberrant rna population  <cit> . these proteins are required for both cytoplasmic gene silencing that is triggered by transgenes or viral infection, as well as, nuclear gene silencing for transposons and inverted repeats in the genome. in arabidopsis,  <dig> genes encode rdrs out of which only  <dig> genes have been shown to be involved in viral defense, chromatin silencing and ptgs. rdr <dig>  also known as sgs <dig> and sde <dig> amplifies improper terminated and unpolyadenylated rnas generated from transgenes or inverted repeats to trigger degradation of complementary rna species  <cit> . genetic studies in arabidopsis have also revealed that rdr <dig> functions in the same pathway as ago <dig> and asymmetric leaves  <dig> and  <dig>  to control adaxial/abaxial patterning in leaves  <cit> . this role of rdr <dig> appears to be evolutionarily conserved in dicot and monocot lineages as in rice it was recently reported that shl <dig> along with shl <dig>  and sho <dig> affect sirna and tasirna mediated regulation of endogenous genes involved in sam and leaf development  <cit> . arabidopsis rdr <dig> is required for combating viral infection through ptgs and is involved in sirna mediated de novo methylation of direct repeats. recently, it has been shown that the homolog of arabidopsis rdr <dig> in maize, mop <dig>  is involved in paramutation of b <dig> locus  <cit> . the mop <dig> gene maintains a threshold level of rna encoded by repeat sequences that modify chromatin at b <dig> locus. this gene is also closely related to osrdr <dig>  the role of osrdr <dig> is not known yet, however its expression was observed to overlap with arabidopsis rdr <dig> at earlier stages of flower development and it phylogenetically relates to both maize and arabidopsis genes. it will therefore be interesting to study the role of this gene in rice to validate the speculation of conservation of their roles, based on their similar expression patterns, in dicots and monocots.

CONCLUSIONS
regulation of gene expression at post-transcriptional level plays a critical role in plant development. rna interference mediated by activities of dicers, argonautes and rna-dependent rna polymerases is an important regulatory process that checks transcript accumulation in cells. these components are also shared by other gene-silencing pathways. dicer-like, argonautes and rdrs are encoded by small multigene families and rice encodes the largest number of these genes among the plant species analyzed so far. phylogenetic analysis and localization on rice pseudomolecules have revealed that duplication of genes, both segmental and tandem, have contributed to increase in number of these genes in rice. however, function of only a few of these genes has been established in both rice and arabidopsis. a key objective of this study was to generate and compile an expression profile data set to facilitate selection of candidate genes for validation of their roles during reproductive phase of plant development and abiotic stress responses. more than  <dig> genes belonging to these three gene families were observed to express preferentially/specifically during panicle and seed development. this work has provided insights into the probable domains of activity of these genes.
