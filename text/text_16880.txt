BACKGROUND
olfaction is an important process to establish behavioural response and involves the binding of small, hydrophobic, volatile molecules to receptors of the nasal neuroepithelia  <cit> . the olfaction mechanism has been well studied and is generally similar in vertebrates, insects, crustaceans, and nematodes  <cit> . the first step in olfaction is the solubilization of the hydrophobic odorants in the hydrophilic nasal mucus.

odorant binding proteins  play a vital role in the olfaction. obps are small soluble polypeptides, which are thought to act as a carrier for odorants and carries odorant from the environment to the nasal epithelium in vertebrates and sensillar lymph in insects  <cit> . obps of vertebrate are members of large family lipocalin and shares eight stranded beta barrel  <cit> . insects obps include the general odorant-binding proteins  and the pheromone-binding proteins , which are completely different from their vertebrate counterpart both in sequence and three-dimensional folding  <cit> . insect obps contains alpha helical barrel and six highly conserved cysteines  <cit> . another class of putative obps, named chemosensory proteins  has been reported in different orders of insects, including lepidoptera  <cit> . these polypeptides, of about  <dig> kda, do not exhibit significant homology to pbps and gobps and contain four conserved cysteine residues all involved in intramolecular disulphide bridges. in spite of the sequence and structural difference, their general chemical properties indicate similar functions in olfactory transduction.

previous reports have shown that obps are present in large number within a species  <cit> . this suggests that obps do play an active role in odorant recognition rather than merely serving as passive odorant shuttles  <cit> . several reports have demonstrated selective binding of odorants to different obps derived from a given species  <cit> . obps are also suspected to participate in the deactivation of odorants and signal termination  <cit> . presence of obps in non-sensory tissues of insect suggests their non-sensory roles  <cit> 

although many efforts have been made to study the role of obps, their physiological function is still unclear and more sequence data are required for the complete understanding of the odorant binding and transport mechanism. with the rapid increase in newly found protein sequences entering into databanks, an efficient method is needed to identify obps from the sequence databases. at present, prediction of the odorant binding proteins is primarily based on sequence similarity search methods  <cit>  and these methods will not be employed efficiently due to the fact that obps show very low sequence similarity between species and within the same species  <cit> . so far, svm and other statistical learning methods have not been explored for predicting odorant binding proteins. here, we propose a method based on regularized least squares classifier  method to predict odorant binding proteins from sequence-derived properties irrespective of sequence similarity.

RESULTS
the dataset used for the prediction was obtained from gendis  <cit>  and pfam  <cit>  databases. positive class consists of  <dig> odorant binding protein domains . whereas the negative class has  <dig> non-odorant binding protein domains . a regularized least squares classifier   <cit>  was used to conduct the training and testing on the dataset. first, the classification was carried out without feature selection, i.e. all the  <dig> features were used. the confusion matrix achieved by rlsc is given in table  <dig> 

to analyze the impact of the feature selection procedure on the classification performance, we selected eight feature subsets by decreasing the number of features. the performance of the method for discriminating between odorant binding proteins and non-odorant binding proteins is summarized in table  <dig>  in this table, tp and tn stand for true positive , and true negative . the results show that our method can distinguish odorant binding proteins from other protein sequences with an accuracy of >90% and matthews correlation coefficient  of  <dig> , when evaluated through leave one out cross validation. using all the  <dig> features, the rlsc achieved the tp rate of  <dig> % and the tn rate of  <dig> %. the overall leave-one-out accuracy , balanced looa and mcc were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig>  respectively. as seen in table  <dig>  feature selection generally does not deteriorate the classification performance much. the usage of smaller number of features only leads to a decrease of the tn rate. the tp rate is less influenced by the feature selection. in some cases, feature selection even leads to slight increase of the tp rates.

to test the capability, our algorithm was evaluated by independent dataset obtained from ncbi database using keyword search. the keywords used for the search includes "odorant binding proteins", "pheromone binding proteins", "chemosensory proteins", "antennal protein" and "juvenile hormone binding proteins". the sequences that are present in the positive training dataset were removed from the list. after careful manual inspection,  <dig> odorant binding proteins were selected for independent testing . the performance of our algorithm was compared with psi-blast  <cit>  and hmm  <cit> . psi-blast search for each sequence was carried out against the database of positive training dataset. hmm analysis for each query sequence was performed against the hmm profile obtained from the positive training dataset. our approach correctly predicts  <dig> proteins as odorant binding proteins whereas psi-blast and hmm methods predict  <dig> and  <dig> proteins respectively . the overall prediction accuracy for our approach, psi-blast and hmm method is  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively .

further analysis of  <dig> odorant binding proteins shows that  <dig> proteins have no single homologous protein in the swissprot  <cit>  database based on psi-blast search result. a similarity e-value threshold of  <dig>  was used for homologue search to ensure maximum exclusion of proteins that have a homologue. our method correctly predicts  <dig> proteins as odorant binding proteins. this result shows the capability of our prediction systems for recognizing novel odorant binding proteins that are non-homologous to other proteins.

in this work, a total of nine physicochemical properties, secondary structural content and frequencies of di-peptides and tripeptides were used to represent each protein sequence. it has been reported that not all feature vectors contribute equally to the classification of proteins; some have been found to play a relatively more prominent role than others in specific aspects of proteins  <cit> . it is therefore of interest to examine which feature properties play more prominent roles in the classification of odorant-binding proteins. our analysis suggests that molecular weight, hydrophobicity, hydration potential, average accessible surface area and refractivity play more prominent role. hydrophobicity is an important factor for the formation of binding pocket and also for the interaction between obp and odorant molecule. it is also observed that the tripeptides play significant role in our classification scheme than dipeptides.

CONCLUSIONS
overall prediction accuracy of  <dig> %  shows that rlsc is a potentially useful tool for the prediction of odorant-binding proteins. it is also a computationally efficient method for the prediction of odorant binding proteins despite the low sequence identity. further, the capability of our method is tested by an independent dataset consisting of  <dig> members and this method is able to predict  <dig> % of  <dig> odorant binding proteins. this approach can be used to identify novel odorant binding proteins from genome sequence databases using sequence-derived properties.
