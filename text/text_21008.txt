BACKGROUND
hyperlipidemia has been regarded as a common characteristic for obese dogs  <cit> , and prevalence of overweight and obese dog has been estimated as 24% to 30%  <cit> . hyperlipidemic condition could be a deteriorative factor for metabolic syndrome in dogs  <cit> . physiological variables, such as age, body weight and sex may affect hyperlipidemia severity in dogs  <cit> . effect of aging on plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in hyperlipidemic dogs has been reported by our colleagues  <cit> . we have to pay much attention to lipid metabolic condition associated with lipid oxidative stress, antioxidant and inflammation degree, and insulin resistance in dogs with different ages. hyperlipidemia in aged dogs seems to be confounded by nutrition states, inflammation, and oxidative stress as the same as in aged human  <cit> .

plasma malondialdehyde  concentrations have been regarded as a lipid peroxide stress marker  <cit> , and the correlation between plasma lipid peroxide levels and high prevalence of diabetic patients has been reported in human  <cit> . superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase have been regarded as enzymes that increase with oxidation stress elevation. alpha 1-acid glycoprotein is an acute phase protein that is produced in the liver in response to inflammation. excess non-esterified fatty acid  released from adipocytes induces lipotoxicity. plasma insulin and adiponectin are hormones that suggest the degree of insulin resistance. in this study, we investigated the changes in above mentioned plasma parameters and cholesterol and tg profiles in  <dig> dogs with different ages though we could not elucidate the daily rhythmicity of lipid levels completely  <cit> .

methods
animals
twelve client-owned young dogs  and twelve aged dogs  were examined. the age, breed, sex and body weight of dogs used in the present study were shown in table  <dig>  each dog was given a meal twice a day. the diet composition varied among examined dogs, since each dog’s owner was permitted to give normal diet in this study. all animals exhibited no clinical signs for diseases and were not on any medication at the time of the study. they were recommended to examine plasma biomarker levels on lipid metabolism by veterinarians. any clinically treated animals were excluded from the study. the degree of obesity in dogs was assessed by a five-level body conditioning score  as follows  <cit> : very thin  <cit> , underweight  <cit> , ideal  <cit> , over weight  <cit>  and obese  <cit> , commonly used in japan  <cit> . ethical approval was obtained from the nippon veterinary and life science university animal research committee . written informed consent was obtained from the owners of the animals in this study.

b: aged group .

blood samples were taken from jugular veins of dogs fasted overnight  in heparinized tubes. plasma was recovered by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm, for 15 min at 4°c in each veterinary clinic and subsequently stored at -25°c until use. glucose , tc, tg, total protein , blood urea nitrogen  and creatinine  concentrations and alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase  activities were measured using an autoanalyzer  with the manufacture’s reagents at monolis inc. . it took less than a week to obtain the results of laboratory analysis.

plasma alpha1-acid glycoprotein  concentrations were measured by single radial immunodiffusion method at monolis inc. plasma nefa and mda concentrations were measured using commercial kit, nefa-c test , and nwlsstm malondialdehyde assay , respectively. plasma insulin  and adiponectin  concentrations were measured with commercial elisa kits, lbis dog insulin kit , mouse/rat adiponectin kit , respectively. plasma sod activity and gshpx activities were measured using commercial kit, nwlsstm superoxide dismutase activity assay , and nwlsstm glutathione peroxidase assay , respectively.

plasma lipoprotein cholesterol and tg profiles were measured by the biphasic agarose gel electrophoresis method using commercial kit, quickgel lipo gels  with cho/trig combo reagents .

statistical analysis
results are presented as mean ± sd. statistical significance was determined by unpaired student’s t-test. the significance level was set at p <  <dig> .

correlation coefficient between the age and each parameter value was calculated by peason’s method. the significance level was set at p <  <dig> , p <  <dig> , respectively.

RESULTS
as shown in table  <dig>  bcs  in young dogs was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , while that in aged dogs was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . though there were no significant differences statistically, plasma tg, mda and nefa levels in aged dogs were higher than those in young dogs. using electrophoretic measurements, the level of the third tg-lipoprotein fraction from the positive pole  in aged dogs was determined significantly higher than that in young animals. . representative cholesterol lipoprotein and tg lipoprotein electrophoresis tracing in young and aged dogs were shown in figure 1a and b, respectively. the biphasic agarose gel electrophoresis technique revealed a prominent third tg-lipoprotein fraction from the positive pole  in aged dogs.

discussion
in this study,  <dig> miniature schnauzer were included. however, they will need to be separated from other breeds for further study since they have genetic problems associated with lipid metabolism. bcs in aged dogs was higher than that in young dogs and plasma lipid metabolic biomarker, tg, mda, and nefa levels increased with aging. in addition, moderate positive correlations  were seen between the age and tg, tg fraction  <dig>  mda, alpha1-ag levels, respectively, while moderate negative correlations  were seen between the age and cholesterol lipoprotein fraction  <dig>  glu, adn levels, respectively by peason’s analysis.

it was reported that increase in plasma tg levels was one of characteristics indicating lipid accumulation in the liver of animals  <cit> . on the contrary, plasma adn concentrations significantly decreased in aged dog group with a higher mean bcs compared to the young dog group. it was reported that adipose cells secreted decreased amounts of adn as lipid accumulated in subcutaneous and visceral portion of the body  <cit> .

generally, plasma levels of mda as a lipid peroxide stress marker increase in presence of oxidative stress. it was reported that serum mda levels in cancer dogs with oxidative stress were significantly higher than those in clinically normal dogs  <cit> . increase in plasma mda concentrations in aged dogs may indicate increase in lipid peroxide stress in aged dogs with tendency to be overweight. in addition, plasma mda levels are considered to be lipid peroxide stress marker that may suggest early stage of lipid metabolic disorder in dogs. plasma nefa levels in aged dogs were higher than those in young dogs. it was reported that increased plasma nefa induced heterotopy lipid accumulation in the body and excess β-oxidation in pancreatic β-cells, which induced reactive oxygen species  generation  <cit> . finally, excess nefa induced pancreatic β cell dysfunction, which referred to as lipotoxicity  <cit> . lipotoxicity induces insulin resistance  <cit> . plasma ins concentrations in aged dogs were higher than those in young dogs, which may suggest an association between lipid metabolic disorder and insulin resistance with aging in dogs.

the activities of plasma sod, an antioxidant, were higher in aged dogs. it is speculated that one of reasons that plasma antioxidant increase with aging was due to the lipid peroxide increase with aging. in the present study, plasma mda levels were higher in aged dogs. plasma sod levels in  <dig> young dogs and  <dig> aged dogs were analyzed statistically, since  <dig> of  <dig> in young dogs and  <dig> of  <dig> in aged dogs had sod levels lower than detectable range under detection limit levels , while plasma gshpx levels in  <dig> aged dogs were analyzed statistically, since  <dig> of  <dig> in aged dogs indicated above detection limit levels .plasma alpha1-ag levels in aged dogs were significantly higher than those in young dogs. these results suggest that inflammatory condition associated with lipid accumulation may progress in aged dogs. acute phase proteins will play an important role at early stage of lipid disorder in dogs. the third tg-lipoprotein fraction from the positive pole  in aged dogs was prominent as revealed by the biphasic agarose gel electrophoresis technique . we think this fraction may be very low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride. further comparative examination on tg lipoprotein fractions separated by electrophoresis versus ultracentrifugation will be necessary to confirm this point.

in our previous report  <cit> , we proposed the new criteria to detect canine hyperlipidemia at early stage based on the any two of the following three factors, namely elevated plasma triglyceride  , total cholesterol   and non-esterified fatty acid   levels. based on the criteria,  <dig> of  <dig>  in young dogs and  <dig> of  <dig>  in aged dogs were diagnosed as hyperlipidemia in the present study.

CONCLUSIONS
lipid metabolic disorder seems to be complicated by nutrition states, inflammation, oxidative stress in dogs. present data suggested that these factors were affected by aging. we should continue further examination to clarify these relationships in order to confirm its reliability in detecting early stage of lipid metabolic disorder in dogs.
