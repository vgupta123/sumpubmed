BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  are the largest superfamily of membrane proteins and serve as targets for more than 30% of all modern drugs. the rhodopsin family is the largest within the gpcr superfamily and includes the α-, β-, γ- and δ-subgroups  <cit> . the α group of rhodopsin gpcrs includes melanocortin  receptors. the ligands for the mc receptors are the melanocortic peptides: α-, β-, γ-melanocyte stimulating hormones  and adrenocorticotropic hormone , all derived from the precursor proopiomelanocortin . in addition the mc receptors bind the agouti signalling peptide  and agouti related protein  that are endogenous antagonists that regulate pigmentation and food intake through the mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptors, respectively. the mc receptors are found in five subtypes in mammals and birds, named mc1-mc <dig> receptors  <cit> . the mc receptor subtypes have very different physiological roles but the mc <dig> receptor has received extraordinary attention, as it is the most recognized monogenic cause for obesity  <cit> . mc <dig> receptor agonists reduce food intake  <cit>  and mc <dig> receptor antagonists are very efficient in increasing food intake and body weight  <cit> . the mc <dig> receptor and the mc <dig> receptor, which is also involved in regulating energy homeostasis, are some of the most pursued drug targets among gpcrs  <cit> .

we have previously demonstrated the presence of mc receptors in teleost fishes  <cit>  and that the mc <dig> receptor plays an important role for regulation of food intake in teleosts  <cit> . we have also shown that the mc <dig> receptor is likely to regulate food intake in birds  <cit> . the zebrafish has six mc receptors due to an additional copy of the mc <dig> receptor, which we suggest was created through a tetraploidization within the teleost lineage. the teleost fugu has only four mc receptors as it is lacking the mc <dig> receptor  <cit> . moreover, there are some differences in the ligand preference between teleosts and mammals: acth seems to play a more prominent role for the mc receptor in fugu and trout as compared with α-msh  <cit> , which is selective to four msh binding mc receptors in mammals. furthermore, we recently cloned and characterised mc <dig>  mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptors from another gnathostome, the spiny dogfish. the results showed high conservation in sequence and pharmacology compared to human orthologs  <cit> , but it is still not known if cartilaginous fishes have any other types of mc receptors. it also remains unknown if mc receptors can be found in more ancient species.

the only extant jawless vertebrates are lamprey and hagfish that form unique basal groups in the craniate lineage intermediate between amphioxius  and gnathostomes . it is proposed that lineages leading to lamprey and hagfish underwent one large-scale genome duplication, whereas the second doubling may have occurred in the gnathostome ancestor lineage. the agnathans differ from other vertebrates by lacking bone tissue and a biting apparatus. they have been suggested to have diverged from the lineage leading to mammals  <dig> myr ago  <cit>  and represent some of the key species whose genomes have not been sequenced. the msh ligands are all derived from pomc, which has been intensively studied in lower vertebrates and it seems that the pomc gene has arisen early in chordate evolution  <cit> . among the pomc genes that have been cloned, the two pomc genes from the agnathan lamprey are the ones most distantly related to mammals. degenerative sequences for melanotropins  and corticotropin  peptides were found to be encoded by two distinct genes  <cit> .

in this paper we report the cloning of two mc receptors from river lamprey and a fragment of mc receptor from hagfish. these receptors are the most ancient mc receptors found to date. we expressed one of the lamprey receptors and performed thorough characterization of its pharmacological properties with respect to both human and lamprey melanocortin peptides. moreover, we show the anatomical distribution of the two lamprey receptors.

RESULTS
cloning of melanocortin receptors from hagfish
the degenerate pcr using genomic dna from atlantic hagfish resulted in a fragment of approx  <dig> bp. the fragment was cloned and sequenced. the sequence was blasted against the genbank database, which indicated high similarity to mc receptors. the clone was used for high stringency screening of atlantic hagfish genomic library in lambda gem- <dig>  the screening did however not result in any positive full-length clones from this library.

cloning of melanocortin receptors from river lamprey
the degenerate pcr on genomic dna of river lamprey resulted in two fragments of approx  <dig> bp. the fragments were cloned and sequenced. two different sequences were blasted against the genbank database and showed similarity to mc receptors. the clones were used for high stringency screening of a river lamprey genomic library. two positive cosmid clones were isolated and sequenced. both clones were found to contain the same intronless gene of  <dig> bp, corresponding to a putative mc receptor of  <dig> amino acids. the sequences of both clones were found to be identical to only one of the mc receptor fragments obtained from the pcr. repeated screening with another fragment as a probe did not result in any other cosmid clone from this library.

in order to obtain the entire coding region of the second mc gene, we performed inverse pcr on lamprey genomic dna, as previously described  <cit> . we were able to extend the sequence in both 3' and 5' directions and overlap the stop codon, but not the initiating atg codon. the genome sequencing reads of sea lamprey, petromyzon marinus were downloaded from  <cit> . the database was formatted with formatdb  <cit> . we searched for mc receptor like sequences in the formatted database using blastall. the sequences with highest similarity score were used to design primers in the proposed n terminal regional of the second lamprey receptor. the full-length gene was amplified from river lamprey genomic dna using pfx polymerase. the fragment was purified and sequenced. the full-length intronless sequence of  <dig> bp, corresponding to a putative lamprey receptor of  <dig> amino acids was obtained.

the amino acid sequence alignment of the new river lamprey genes and the partial sequence from hagfish together with human, chicken and zebrafish mc receptors is displayed in figure  <dig>  the percent identities of amino acid sequences are shown in additional file  <dig>  the lamprey receptor of  <dig> amino acids exhibits the highest identity, 50–55%, to the mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptor subtypes and 48–55% to the mc <dig> receptors, while the identity to the mc <dig> receptors is lower, 46–51%. this lamprey receptor has the lowest similarity to the mc <dig> subtype, 35–43%. this river lamprey receptor was designated mca receptor. the lamprey receptor of  <dig> amino acids showed the highest identity of 60–67% to the mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptor subtypes and 58–62% to the mc <dig> subtype, while the similarity to the mc <dig> and mc <dig> subtypes was lower, 46–55% and 44–47% respectively. this river lamprey receptor was named mcb receptor. the similarity between the mca and mcb receptors was 52%. the partial sequence from hagfish showed the highest similarity to mc <dig> and mc <dig> subtypes, 56–63% and 59–63%, respectively. the similarity to mc <dig> subtype was lower, 50–59%, followed by mc <dig> subtype  and mc <dig> subtype . the similarity between hagfish fragment, named mcc receptor, and the corresponding sequence of lamprey mca and mcb receptors was  <dig> and 65%, respectively.

phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic analysis was performed using neighbor-joining method and a tree of the mc receptors is presented in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the topology of the trees was the same with or without out-group . in both trees, the lamprey mca receptor branched at the base of the mc <dig> receptor group with bootstrap values  <dig> and  <dig>  in both trees the lamprey mcb receptor branched at the base of the mc <dig> receptor group with bootstrap values of  <dig> and  <dig>  the partial hagfish mcc receptor branched at the base of the mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptor groups .

molecular clock analysis
the theoretical time of divergence of agnathans is estimated  <dig> myr for molecular and  <dig> myr for fossil data  <cit> . the mc receptor subtypes displayed different sequence divergence rates as is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the evolutionary rate of lamprey mca receptor was most similar to the mc <dig> receptor subtype. considering the mc3/4/ <dig> receptor cluster, the lamprey mcb receptor had the divergence rate most similar to the mc <dig> receptor subtype. this analysis indicated that the mca and mcb receptors diverged from each other more than  <dig> myr. due to the possible differences in evolutionary rates, this analysis is not conclusive regarding whether the divergence occurred before or after the lamprey split from the lineage leading to mammals.

competition and saturation binding experiments on lamprey mc receptor
the lamprey mca receptors were expressed in the hek- <dig> ebna cell line and tested for binding human and lamprey melanocortin peptides. figure  <dig> presents saturation and competition curves for the lamprey mca receptors and table  <dig> displays kd and ki values obtained from saturation and competition experiments, respectively. for comparison, the table also includes previously published results for the human mc receptors tested with the same methodological approach. the results demonstrate that the ligands bind to a single saturable site in the lamprey receptors. the endogenous human ligands α-msh , β-msh, γ-msh , acth  and truncated acth , acth had clearly lower affinities for the lamprey mca receptor, compared to the human mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptors, while the same ligands had clearly higher affinities for the lamprey mca receptor, compared to the human mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptors. the synthetic ligands mtii and hs <dig>  however, bound the lamprey mca receptor with clearly lower affinities than the human mc <dig>  mc <dig>  mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptors. the affinity of lamprey mca receptor to the lamprey peptides was not higher than for the human peptides. the msh-b had the highest affinity of  <dig> nm, followed by acth with  <dig> nm and the msh-a with the lowest affinity of  <dig>  μm .

measurement of intracellular camp in hek- <dig> ebna cells expressing lamprey mc receptor
the lamprey mca receptors were expressed in hek- <dig> ebna cells and tested for ability to couple to g-protein and induce the accumulation of camp. human α-msh, acth  and lamprey msh-a, msh-b and acth  were used as ligands. the results are presented in figure  <dig>  all of the ligands were able to stimulate the accumulation of camp. the ec <dig> value for α-msh was  <dig>  nmol/l, while the acth displayed lower affinity of  <dig> nmol/l. the lamprey peptides had higher ec <dig> values than human peptides:  <dig> nmol/l for msh-b  and  <dig> nmol/l for msh-a . stimulation with acth did not result in a full response.

tissue distribution of lamprey mc receptors
the tissue distribution of the lamprey was determined by rt-pcr. the quality of the mrna was tested with rt-pcr using β-actin primers and is demonstrated in additional file  <dig>  the results for both lamprey receptors are shown in figure  <dig>  each pair of pcr primers was designed to be specific for only one of the receptor subtypes. the specificity of the pcr reactions was estimated by hybridization blot with the lamprey mc receptor subtype specific probes. there was no cross-hybridization detected between samples . a strong signal for the lamprey mca receptor was detected in the skin. other tissues did not show the presence of the mca receptor. unlike the mca receptor, the mcb receptor was detected in several tissues. the strongest signal appeared in the liver, while slightly weaker signal was detected in the skin, and finally, two weak signals, only detectable on the southern blot were found in the heart and muscle of the lamprey. neither mca, nor mcb receptors were detected in the brain of the river lamprey.

discussion
for the first time, we show the presence of mc receptors in agnathans, both the river lamprey and the atlantic hagfish. this finding is important as the agnathans are among the most ancient living vertebrates. the phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis indicated that lamprey mca receptor belongs to the mc <dig> receptor subtype, while lamprey mcb receptor belongs to the mc <dig> receptor subtype . however, the amino acid identity analysis indicated that both receptors are most similar to the mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptors.

it is well known that different proteins evolve at different rates because of natural selection for functions  <cit> . our molecular clock analysis highlights the differences in the sequence divergence rates between the mc1- <dig> receptor subtypes, that seem to evolve fast, and the mc3-4- <dig> subtypes that evolve slower . this is confirmed by amino acid analysis of the different subtypes that for example show much higher similarity to the mc3-4- <dig> receptors in mammals and fish as compared with the mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptors . while the mcb receptor clearly seems to belong to the rather slowly evolving mc3-4- <dig> cluster that surely must have existed prior to the split of agnathans from the lineage of chordates, the mc <dig> receptor character of the mca receptor may suggest that an ancestor to the mc <dig> receptor was also present at this stage in evolution. it is interesting to note that the percentage identity between the mca and mcb receptors is much lower than for example the dogfish mc <dig> or mc <dig> receptors, which are the evolutionary most closely related mc receptors identified so far. it seems thus clear that these two lamprey receptor genes were not duplicated recently. the molecular clock analysis supports this, placing the divergence of these two genes more than  <dig> myr ago. none of the ancestral mc receptors displayed any high similarity to the mc <dig>  receptor subtype. this could mean that either there exists an additional subtype in lamprey with mc <dig> receptor characteristics or that the mc <dig> receptor appeared at a later stage. we could not identify any mc receptors in invertebrates or in the tunicate ciona, despite our very comprehensive searches with hmms, which has in our hands proven to be a very effective tool to find divergent sequences  <cit> . moreover, our initial searches indicate that the cephalochordate amphioxus does not have any mc receptors either . this suggests that the mc receptor family appeared first in the agnathan lineage, after the divergence of craniates , but before the appearance of jawed vertebrates. taken altogether, the genes we isolated and characterised here, could code for the most ancestral mc receptors.

it has previously been reported that orthologs to the large precursor peptide, proopiomelanocortin  are found in lamprey and that these are encoded by two genes, pom  and poc . pom encodes β-endorphin and two degenerated sequences termed msh-a, msh-b, while poc encodes another β-endorphin and an acth like sequence  <cit> . the position of msh-b corresponds to that of acth, while the position of msh-a corresponds to that of β-msh in mammalian pomc. the mammalian and fish melanocortin peptides  cannot be distinguished. similarity in exon/intron organization, the position of β-endorphin and acth/msh-b suggests that pom and poc appeared from a duplication of an ancestral pomc gene  <cit> . it seems thus clear that ancestral  pomc gene contained orthologs of both acth and β-endorphin. the core binding sequence hfrw is conserved between human and sea lamprey melanocortin peptides but α-msh and acth  have much larger conserved motif sysmehfrwgkp in all species described so far, except the gecko eublepharis macularius,  <cit> . for lamprey msh-a, msh-b and acth, this common motif looks like xyxmxhfrwgxp  <cit> . it was therefore interesting to test if these four amino acid substitutions would affect the pharmacology. because we had ancestor-like mc receptor clone from river lamprey, we decided to synthesize the melanocortin peptides from lamprey and test their pharmacological properties with this receptor. we showed that the lamprey mca receptor was able to bind both lamprey and human endogenous msh peptides as well as their synthetic analogues. this could be related to the fact that the core binding sequence of the msh peptides  is well conserved in the lamprey. the ability of the lamprey receptor to bind all the mc ligands that we tested shows that the lamprey mca receptor is indeed a msh binding receptor and that it does not have the mc <dig>  receptor subtype characteristics to bind only acth, but not msh peptides. the binding profile of this lamprey receptor is not in particular similar to the mc <dig> receptors, having much lower affinities for all mc receptor ligands. it did neither have the characteristics of the mammalian mc <dig> receptor, which has preference to β-msh and low affinity to γ-msh, or the mammalian mc <dig> receptor, which has preference to γ-msh. despite the generally low affinity of the mca receptor it still binds all human ligands with higher affinities than the human mc <dig> receptor. the potency order of the lamprey mca receptor was most similar to the dogfish mc <dig> receptor  <cit> , while affinity levels in general were most similar to the trout mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptors  <cit> . interestingly, the mca receptor shows higher affinity for γ-msh and acth than the human mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptors. all this points to the direction that the ancestral mc receptors had a rather promiscuous binding profile and that the specification of the different subtypes has occurred at a later stage in the evolution. the lamprey receptor had highest affinity for the acth. we have previously reported that mc receptors from non-mammalian vertebrates seem to prefer acth peptides before other ligands  <cit> . this pharmacology of the lamprey receptor further supports our previous hypothesis that acth peptides could have acted as the "original" ligand at the mc receptors. it is also notable that the lamprey receptor has higher affinity to the lamprey acth peptide and the relatively similar msh-b peptide, as compared with msh-a, which also support this hypothesis. the low affinity of msh-a may indicate that there is another mc receptor in lamprey that has this peptide as ligand, and that could obviously be the mcb receptor. moreover, we demonstrated the ability of the lamprey mca receptor to functionally couple to the gs pathway in response to human and lamprey endogenous ligands. this is in line with all previously characterised mc receptors further adding evidence to the notion that the coupling preferences of gpcrs are in general very well conserved through the evolution.

we found that both of the lamprey mca and mcb receptors are expressed in the skin, while the mcb receptor was also found in liver, heart and skeletal muscle. the skin is one of the major sites of expression for the mammalian mc <dig> receptor and the role of acth peptides for skin pigmentation has been highlighted in several studies  <cit> . our new results on the lamprey receptors may indicate that the skin is one of the original sites of expression for the mc receptors. the fact that this receptor binds acth with relatively high affinity could fit with a conserved role of acth in pigmentation. like the mcb receptor, mc <dig> is expressed in liver, heart and skeletal muscle in mammals  <cit> . these findings lend further support to similarities of the mca receptor with the mc <dig> receptor and the mcb receptor with the mc3- <dig> and - <dig> receptors. the pom and poc genes we previously found to be expressed in pars intermedia and pars distalis, respectively, of lamprey pituitary  <cit> . neither of the lamprey mc receptors was detected in the brain. this could suggest that the melanocortin system functioned primarily as endocrine hormonal system where the melanocortin peptide hormones were released centrally to reach the receptors in peripheral tissues such as the skin. this is in line with how acth works for the adrenal mc <dig>  receptors while it is in stark contrast to how pomc products work for the other receptors where they act as local hormones in the brain  and the skin . this could suggest the melanocortin system acted originally in an endocrine hormonal fashion while the function to act as a local hormonal system evolved later. our previous findings in several fish species such as the spiny dogfish, fugu and zebrafish show important central expression pattern for the mc receptors. this could suggest that the central functions for mc receptors developed after the split of agnathans but prior to the split of gnathostomes. it is also possible that the central functions were developed more early on, but that these may have been lost in the lineage leading to lamprey that could be related to parasitic living conditions of these species. moreover, it is also possible that there exist additional lamprey mc receptors with central functions, but that we were unable to isolate them. recent evolutionary theories suggest that duplicate genes more commonly survive by function partitioning or subfunctionalization, rather than acquiring new functions  <cit> . the unique location of the mca receptor in the skin and wide distribution of the mcb receptor in skin, liver, heart could indicate subfunctionalization. it is possible that the mca receptor took over the function in the skin from the wide range of functions of ancestral gene and that the specialisation, which is so apparent for the mammalian mc receptor subtypes, took place later for the mcb receptor subtype.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have described mc receptors in the most ancient living vertebrate, the river lamprey. we have characterized these ancestral receptors by phylogeny, evolutionary divergence rate, pharmacology and anatomical distribution. we show that a lamprey mc receptor can bind msh peptides and like non-mammalian vertebrates, have preference to human acth peptides before other ligands. the anatomical characterization indicates that the mca receptor is a skin receptor, while the mcb receptor has a more broad distribution. the duplication of mc subtypes took place most likely before the divergence of jawed vertebrates or gnathostomes.
