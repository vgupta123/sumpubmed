BACKGROUND
with the maturation of sequencing technologies, we now have a large number of completely sequenced genomes. computational and statistical tools are being developed for comparing genomes and discovering the intriguing differences in gene organization  <cit> . the application of such tools to arthropod genomes has revealed genomic signatures  and conserved elements  . a comparative genomics study of  <dig> drosophilae species led to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary forces that shaped this phylogenetic branch  <cit> .

in recent years, the number of fully sequenced genomes from insects has grown rapidly. however, genome features that contribute to the outstanding diversity among insects are only partially known  <cit> . apis mellifera’s genome and proteome provide a glimpse of the first hymenoptera social insect  <cit> . formicidae , like bees, are social animals  <cit>  with a remarkable diversification dated from over  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . currently, arthropods  <cit>  are represented by tens of complete/draft genomes that cover a broad evolutionary time scale  <cit> . gene innovation, evolution of regulatory sequences  <cit> , and genome dynamics were proposed in view of the ability of species to cope with extreme conditions . co-evolution with plants and various pathogens  <cit> , episodes of lateral gene transfer  <cit>  and haplodiploidy were postulated to shape the genomes of some insects  <cit> .

it is a major computational challenge to systematically assign functional annotations to coding sequences in newly sequenced genomes  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the benefit of combining  <dig> completely sequenced insect genomes as well as one crustacean   <cit> ). these proteomes jointly included almost  <dig>  sequences. our primary goal was to provide a comprehensive, unbiased systematic approach for partitioning insects’ proteomes to functional families. applying routine annotation schemes  allowed assignment of molecular functions to a large fraction of the proteins. still, no pfam keywords were assigned for 27 % of all proteins. we took advantage of the completeness of proteomes, and quantified the variability among insects using the notion of statistically significant species-specific families. we analyzed the main evolutionary branches of insects  in view of hundreds of cases of expansion and contraction of protein families. we postulate that variability among species with respect to their families is a good proxy for revealing the lineage-uniqueness of species.

RESULTS
clustering by protein sequence similarity distances
the protein sequences that were included in the analysis were derived from completely sequenced genomes. there are  <dig>  protein sequences . the two larger species groups belong to hymenoptera  and diptera . the number of sequences from all analyzed proteomes is summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

we performed an all-against-all blast search for the entire set of sequences that resulted in a large distance matrix . this matrix is used as input to a hierarchical clustering that is based on the protonet algorithm and on a predetermined partition of the output tree  <cit> . fig. 1a shows the clustering scheme for all  <dig> analyzed species . notably, the representation of species among families having  <dig> proteins is significantly higher in view of the random expectation . note that there are hundreds of families  that are very large and include at least  <dig> proteins each .fig.  <dig> the hierarchical clustering of protein sequences from complete sequenced genomes. a protolevel  is a normalized measure for the time of clustering procedure, where all leaves and the root cluster have pl =  <dig> and pl =  <dig>  respectively. cuts at predetermined pl thresholds are shown . at a certain cut, the clusters are a collection of disjoint families. higher value for pl is associated with a smaller number of protein families. empty circles mark proteins that are unannotated by an external expert system  but belong to the family. root superfamilies  are clusters at the top of the hierarchy based on a pruning of the binary tree at pl <dig>  the total number of protobug families, root sfs and proteins that have no external annotations is shown. b size distribution of the protein families from  <dig> arthropods-complete proteomes. the histogram of protein families is ranked by their sizes. the blue bars show families of size  <dig> and multiplications . all families with > <dig> proteins each are combined



the clustering protocol led to  <dig>  clusters  and additional  <dig> singletons. these are disjoint protein families. figure  <dig> shows the number of families with respect to the accepted taxonomy tree. the proteomes are partitioned on average to ~ <dig> families in the case of diptera and to ~ <dig> families for hymenoptera.fig.  <dig> protein families of the arthropods complete proteomes by species-specific assignment. each of the  <dig> analyzed organisms is associated with the listed number of protein families  along the accepted phylogenetic tree. d. pulex serves as an outgroup. numbers on the nodes of the phylogenetic tree are the estimated branch length of speciation . branch lengths are extracted from  <cit> , timetree  <cit>   and inference . the sources for all  <dig> complete proteomes and the number of families according to pl <dig> partition are summarized in an additional file 1: table s1



quality of annotation assignment
to assess the quality of the automatically defined protein families we assigned keywords to each protein for domains, families and repeats according to its predicted pfam keywords. the number of proteins that remained unannotated was  <dig>  . altogether  <dig>  pfam keywords were assigned to the  <dig> analyzed proteomes, and the functional coherence of each family was quantified with respect to the pfam keywords.

table  <dig> lists the largest families  according to their size and family specificity score . we assessed annotation quality and coherence for each of the resulting families. we found very high average specificity , confirming the quality of the unsupervised classification protocol with respect to external knowledge. as mentioned, the clustering protocol relies entirely on sequences and used no annotations or pre-knowledge. within a family, unannotated proteins are assumed to share the same function as the annotated proteins in the family . we refer to such inference as “annotation gain” . among the  <dig>  disjoint protein families ,  <dig> families have a minimal size of ≥ <dig> proteins each. families with a small number of proteins  are more sensitive to noise. therefore, the rest of the analysis focuses on families with at least  <dig> proteins. a comprehensive list of  <dig> mapped pfam keywords  is available in additional file 2: table s <dig> table  <dig> largest families, associated pfam keywords and family specificity

diversification in protein families
by comparing families, we derived an indirect assessment for the divergence rate. we searched for all family-species pairs and focus on protein families where a species  is present or absent with respect to neighboring species in the phylogenetic tree. these are assigned as family gain and family loss . the highest number of families gained is associated with d. pulex . extreme diversification with over  <dig> families gained is associated with t. castaneum and a. cephalotes. table  <dig> is a sample of families that are defined as gain and loss  with respect to s. invicta. note that many of these clusters are annotated with broad terms such as “signal peptide” or “transmembrane”. a minimal family size of  <dig> was required for determining a family loss. the list of gains and losses for all  <dig> species is available in additional file 3: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> gains and losses of protein families. a for each species the right bar represents the number of gained protein families, and the left bar , the number of losses. the highest number is associated with d. pulex, an outgroup species for the  <dig> insect proteomes. b turnover rate  for all species. tor is calculated as the sum of gains and losses from the leaf up to the root. for tor estimation we used branch length as shown in fig.  <dig>  the hymenoptera are associated with a higher overall tor with respect to diptera



ag/l, gain or loss of a family, respectively. bsize, the family sizes for g and l are ≥ <dig> and ≥ <dig>  respectively



we further estimated the dynamics at internal branch in the phylogenic tree by estimating the turnover rate . we found that tor for the hymenoptera clade is significantly higher with respect to diptera . among the hymenoptera clade, the proteomes of the different ants have in general the highest tor. using badirate tool  <cit>  for assessing tor, we confirmed that the higher tor is significantly associated with the hymenoptera with respect to the diptera .

most families contain representatives from multiple species . the number of proteins in a family indicates evolutionary events at the genome level such as gene duplication or retrovirus integration. we therefore systematically identified such events by monitoring families’ expansion and contraction for any of the analyzed species. the number of proteins in a family for a species was often skewed with respect to the number of sequences. for example, in a family annotated “7tm odorant receptor” , there are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins, from atta cephalotes, acromyrmex echinatior and pediculus humanus, respectively. divergence is estimated by a significant deviation in the representation of some species .

we collected  <dig> families of size ≥ <dig> that showed an expansion for one  insect species, and  <dig> families that have a significant contraction in at least one of the insects. note a substantial overlap of the two lists . as could be anticipated, once the d. pulex is included, the number of families with significant expansion or contraction is far higher. d. pulex contributed an additional  <dig> and  <dig> families, for expansion and contraction, respectively .fig.  <dig> divergence with respect to protein families. a venn diagrams of protein families  with a significant expansion or contraction . top: the analysis based on  <dig> insect proteomes. a total of  <dig> ssf  were significantly expanded in at least one species.  <dig> ssf were significantly contracted and  <dig> families intersected . bottom: the analysis based on  <dig> arthropod proteomes,  <dig> insects and a proteome of d. pulex. b ratios of ssf that belong to unified set of pfam annotations  relative to all annotated ssf. the analysis for tnap is illustrated for each of the species. correlation lines and calculated coefficients are shown. c histogram of the number of proteins that belong to tnap for each species. d identical analysis as in  for the unified functionality of membrane receptors 



we defined the statistically significant families of size ≥ <dig> as ssf . table  <dig> shows a sample of most significant  ssf for two insects. the ssf list for all  <dig> species is found in additional file 4: table s <dig> table  <dig> pfam keywords for n. vitripennis and s. invicta expanded and contracted protein families

functional enrichment of most diverse protein families
ssf from diptera dominated the annotated list . we limited the functional analysis to families assigned annotations . the annotated ssf accounts for 58 % of all ssf and covers  <dig> pfam keywords. we observed a drastic variation in the number of annotated ssf associated with the different species. yet, many annotations are shared by several species. for example, a family annotated “trypsin”  shows a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> for family expansion in aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae, respectively.

inspecting the function associated with ssf allows, in an initial approximation, to postulate on the functional uniqueness of a species. toward this goal, we mapped ssf to only a few high-level functional descriptors. we unified pfam keywords by the pfam clan assignments  <cit> . for example, a high-level function of signaling receptors  includes ion channels and sensory receptors annotated as 7tm chemosensory receptor, 7tm odorant receptor, transporters and ion channels . another large group of pfam keywords is the transposition and nucleic acid processes . the pfam keywords that are combined by tnap include transposase, non-specific endonucleases, viral and transposons, integrase and multiple families of reverse transcriptase . additionally, we confirmed the association of tnap with the biological processes of transposition and dna-mediated process   <cit> .

figure 4b shows the prevalence of tnap families among the annotated ssf, for any of the  <dig> insect species. there are two distinct strong correlation lines for the annotated ssf that belong to tnap:  species that belong to hymenoptera ;  species that belong to diptera . notice that t. castaneum and p. humanus that do not belong to either of these clades  follow the correlation line of the hymenoptera. the fraction of tnap families among the annotated ssf of the species that belong to diptera accounts for only 3–4 %, while among hymenoptera it reaches 30-40 % . reinforcing the partition of insects into two distinct sets is based on counting the proteins within the tnap families . from all annotated ssf associated with tnap,  <dig>  % are from hymenoptera and  <dig>  % and 3 % are from others and diptera, respectively. among all insects nasonia vitripennis displays an extreme tnap expansion with  <dig> proteins .

we repeated the analysis for additional high-level functionality. in the case of membrane receptor  function, the two clades are inseparable . we conclude that the clear difference in the appearance of tnap families  is not evident for mr function . additional high-level functions such as proteolysis  and cell-matrix adhesion  failed to separate the ssfs between the two major clades of insects.

an unbiased function view leads to biological interpretation of superfamilies
by analyzing ssf we seek functions that are associated with one  species. in order to generalize the observation and to allow analysis for families that fall short when using the annotation inference protocol , we tested all families at the highest level of the hierarchical tree. root superfamilies  are the end product of the clustering protocol for merging nested families and subfamilies . the ~ <dig>  proteins from all  <dig> species are merged into  <dig> root sf clusters .

figure 5a shows the protein partition among the  <dig> species for a root sf annotated “fibrinogen- beta and gamma chains, c-terminal globular domain” . this root sf is of very high quality . we noted a 4: <dig> ratio in favor of the proteins belonging to diptera as compared to hymenoptera .fig.  <dig> analysis of root superfamilies . a number of proteins for  <dig> species for a root sf with  <dig> proteins annotated “fibrinogen-beta and gamma chains, c-terminal globular domain”. the maximal number of proteins is associated with diptera and specifically with the  <dig> mosquitoes. b  <dig> root sfs that have a size of > <dig> proteins from hymenoptera  and diptera . considering only protein from diptera and hymenoptera, the baseline probability for hymenoptera proteins is  <dig>  . a confidence threshold based on binomial distribution at p-value <10e- <dig> is shown as dashed bent lines. the high-level functionalities for expanded and contracted root sf are color-coded. tnap, transposition and nucleic acids processes; h, hymenoptera; d, diptera. the root sf annotated fibrinogen that is analyzed in  is marked by an arrowhead



altogether there are  <dig> root sfs with a minimal size of > <dig> proteins. a table with a summary of these  <dig> root sfs is in additional file 5: table s <dig>  we inspected all  <dig> root sfs and exposed all root sfs that were characterized by a skewed appearance of hymenoptera versus diptera proteins. when combining proteins from hymenoptera and diptera, the partition of the proteins is 61 % and 39 % respectively. we used this ratio as a baseline for assessing the statistical deviation. figure 5b displays the high-level functions of root sf that are significantly skewed for the hymenoptera versus the diptera . the dominant high-level functionalities include membrane receptors , signaling domains, metabolic enzymes and extracellular components. the abundance of root sfs that cover the tnap function is outstanding in hymenoptera . almost all statistically significant root sfs that are dominated by hymenoptera include tnap functions . on the other hand, root sfs in which the proteins of diptera versus hymenoptera favor diptera lack a functional coherence. additionally, some extreme statistics are associated with extracellular localization  and membrane receptors .

traces of viral protein integration in wasp genome
the potential signature for the expansion of tnap in nasonia vitripennis  was tested. one of the ssf families and a root sf with an extremely statistically significant variability in hymenoptera vs. diptera is annotated “poxvirus a <dig> protein”. the poxvirus a <dig> protein  <cit>  encodes a conserved atpase that involved dna packaging in virions of double strand  viruses. surprisingly, we identified  <dig> appearances of poxvirus a <dig> protein with  <dig> of them belonging to the n. vitripennis . fig.  <dig> shows a dendrogram for poxvirus a <dig> homologues from the n. vitripennis . the dendrogram shows branching to worms and hydra in addition to various insects. proteins from cerapachys biroi  and tribolium castaneum are confined to a single branch of the dendrogram, while the distribution of the proteins from the parasitoid wasp is indicative of gene duplications and a high divergence rate.fig.  <dig> the homologues of poxvirus a <dig> protein. n. vitripennis hypothetical protein loc <dig>  was used as a query to create a multiple sequence alignment. about half of the resulting proteins belong to additional insects . appearance of n. vitripennis proteins in multiple nodes of the dendrogram is consistent with evolutionary episodes of spreading of the virus sequences through the parasitoid nasonia species  <cit> 



discussion
in this study, we applied an unsupervised, sequenced-based clustering algorithm  <cit>  for classifying the complete proteomes from arthropods into families. the byproduct of such classification allows:  large-scale functional inference;  quantification of the dynamics of insect proteomes; and  search for evolutionary and functional insights. we will briefly discuss each of these outcomes.

functional inference
in this study we focused on  <dig> proteomes from sequenced genomes. the quality of genome assembly may lead to varying completeness of the input. however, some statistical features of the analyzed genomes are at a comparable level . importantly, many protein families exhibit consistent functional annotations  .

in this study we focused on two resolution levels of the clustering hierarchy: ~ <dig>  high quality families and ~ <dig> root sfs . for example, the root sf “7tm odorant receptor” shows extremely high specificity  for its annotated proteins . nevertheless, only 84 % of the included proteins have pfam annotations. we argue that the high specificity of this root sf with the “7tm odorant receptor” keyword allows safe inference of this keyword . this protocol of limited inference was successfully applied to newly sequenced genomes .

dynamic of proteomes
a comparative analysis for assessing the dynamics of proteomes requires knowledge of evolutionary relationships between the taxa. establishment of social life in insects was associated with an accelerated protein evolutionary rate for only a few families  <cit> . for example, the yellow gene family underwent multiple gene duplications followed by positive selection  <cit> . our analysis corroborates this finding by showing a skewed appearance of the yellow gene family proteins along the insects’ lineage. the unbiased approach presented in this study provides insights on hundreds of families.

the  <dig> representative species are spread along a wide range of evolutionary distance. the evolutionary history of insects’ speciation is not fully resolved  <cit> . the d. melanogaster and d. virilis split ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit> ; they were selected for our analysis to represent remote speciation in view of the  <dig> available drosophilae proteomes  <cit> . on the other hand, the anopheles gambiae and drosophila melanogaster diverged about  <dig> million years ago. an example of recent speciation is the speciation of atta cephalotes and acromyrmex echinatior. these ants were estimated to have split only 8– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . our results argue that even among such closely related species, the number of families  and the number of ssf do not follow the speciation scheme . it was estimated that ∼  <dig> novel genes evolved within ants’ lineage, probably to comply with unique life styles  <cit> . indeed, we observed the largest variations in families among the ant proteomes .

we used tor to estimate the rate of changes in the different proteomes along the evolutionary path . there are various known methods that use a binary ultrametric phylogenetic tree for estimating tor  <cit> . as some of the branches in the phylogenetic tree  are undefined, methods such as cafe  <cit>  and badirate  <cit>  could not be directly applied . artificially transforming the phylogenetic tree to a binary one and applying badirate tool to all possible resulted trees confirmed the results presented in fig. 3b.

we provide evidence for the different evolutionary forces for diptera and hymenoptera based solely on their analyzed proteomes:  based on tor , the dynamic nature of hymenoptera proteomes is revealed. tor is calculated for families’ gains and losses in view of the most accurate phylogenetic tree and speciation branch length  <cit> .  despite the excess in the number of annotated ssf from diptera’s , only 3 % of the proteins belong to tnap, as compared to over 30 % in the case of hymenoptera  . root sfs  cover a large fraction of all analyzed proteins . nevertheless, almost all root sfs  that show a significant expansion for hymenoptera proteins  share tnap functions.

a genome-based analysis for tracing the origin and quantity of orphan genes in insects was performed  <cit> . this study shows that an exceptionally fast dynamic is associated with the wasp and a number of ant genomes. creating new orphan genes is attributed to the presence of transposable elements and to the accelerated genome dynamics in the hymenoptera clade  <cit> . our unbiased approach corroborates the study of orphan genes .

expansion in function
within the comparative genomics paradigm, genomes carry valuable information on the ability of a species to occupy a specific ecological niche  <cit> . the drastic expansion of tnap function in hymenoptera  is consistent with the accelerated genome dynamics demonstrated for ants, wasp and beetle. gene novelty is often associated with an adaptive evolution, as illustrated for a number of proteins from the innate system  <cit> . the evolution of protein families acting in defense against pathogens was discussed in view of insects’ social life  <cit> . tnap proteins are likely to act in rearrangement, homologous and non-homologous dna editing, integration and removal of invaders .

the tnap families rely on the mapping to pfam clan and gene ontology annotation. however, the strong signal for family expansion in hymenoptera relative to diptera was instrumental in revealing related functions . thap domain , duf <dig> and giy-yig catalytic domain  are examples of such instances. mining the literature reveals their relevance to tnap. the thap domain  is shared between cellular proteins and transposases from mobile genomic parasites  <cit> . similarly, the duf <dig> is related to ltr-polyproteins, or retrotransposons. the giy-yig domain characterizes homing endonuclease and selfish mobile elements. these enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of genomic dna within the cells that synthesize them. as such, homing endonucleases are implicated in driving genomes’ dynamics  <cit> .

tnap enables crosstalk of hosts and their pathogens . in accordance with our observation, transposition, viruses, and nucleic acid manipulation are critical components for the evolvement of parasitic life style in hymenoptera  <cit> . the dynamic exchange of genetic material from pathogenic resource  is traceable . however, the expansion in functional groups is not limited to tnap families. the evolution of olfactory receptor family along with insect speciation has been previously reported  <cit> . sensory receptors of the 7-transmembrane families underwent a large expansion in only certain insects. such expansion has been attributed to the pressure of adapting to different environments and to a genomic drift  <cit> .

arthropods’ genome diversity
the platform presented in this study is applicable to completely sequenced proteomes that cover a wide range of evolutionary time. routinely, evolutionary trends are extracted from genomic signatures . we show that an approach that relies on statistical criteria for complete proteomes is valuable in detecting trends for certain branches of the arthropod phylogenetic tree  <cit> . in this study, we focused only on complete proteomes. the taxonomy database  <cit>  contains  <dig>  million sequences from insects. almost all sequences  belong to pterygota  and 90 % of all these sequences originated from endopterygota . our analysis benefits from the availability of data. currently, several genomes from amphiesmenoptera  are not yet included.

similar to our findings, active dna exchange and integration of pathogens and transposition is evident to occur in hymenoptera at a higher rate than in other arthropods  <cit> . analyzing representative proteomes from ditrysia  show that they all share the property of tnap expansion. in contrast, the proteome of pea aphid  resembles the diptera proteome in view of minimal abundance of proteins that belong to tnap.

in addition to the evolutionary perspective for studying insects, insect genome dynamics impact on human health and agriculture. insects play an essential role in pollination, but also in crop loss. other proteomes are studied with respect to human health . we expect the upcoming large-scale initiative of sequencing of arthropods  <cit>  to benefit from the presented clustering platform. the protobug database as well as navigation tools are accessible in www.protobug.cs.huji.ac.il  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we show that from an input of  <dig>  insect proteins ~ <dig>  coherent functional families are produced by an automatic, unsupervised clustering protocol. we illustrate the strength of the statistically unsupervised approach for unveiling expansion and reduction in families with respect to specific species. we suggest that the skewed representation in species-specific families serves as a guideline for phenotypic diversity. the strongest deviation from the expected number of proteins among hundreds of families was associated with tnap proteins that were highly enriched among hymenoptera representatives. we suggest that this signature leads to genome dynamics and may contribute to diversity in protein functions.
