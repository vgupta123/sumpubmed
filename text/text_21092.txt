BACKGROUND
salinity is one of most prevalent abiotic stresses that limit crop productivity in arid and semi-arid regions. salt tolerance of plants is a complex phenomenon that involves morphological and developmental changes as well as physiological and biochemical processes
 <cit> . response by plants to salt stress is a complex network affecting almost all processes, including nutrient uptake and metabolism, ion accumulation and photosynthesis. salt stress in the soil generally involves osmotic stress and ion injury
 <cit> . high salt environments can break the ion homeostasis of plant cells, destroy the ionic balance, and affect the distributions of k+ and na+ in the cells
 <cit> . it is necessary to re-establish the ion homeostasis in cells for plant living under salt-stress
 <cit> . plant survival and growth in saline environments is a result of adaptive processes such as ion transport and compartmentation, compatible solutes synthesis and accumulation. many of these compatible solutes are n-containing compounds, such as amino acids and betaines, hence the nitrogen metabolism is of central importance for salt tolerance
 <cit> .

it is well known that salt stress has different effects on old and young tissues
 <cit> . for example, salt stress produces distinct effects on the growth and na+ accumulation of old and young leaves
 <cit> . it is widely believed that old and young tissues play distinct roles in salt tolerance and plants protect young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of toxic ions like na+ in old leaves during adaptation to salt stress
 <cit> . thus, the understanding of comparative effects of salt stress on old and young tissues may be important for salt tolerance research. although plant biologists have extensively reported the difference between old and young tissues, many questions remain. for example, how do old and young tissues regulate ion balance in response of plants to salt stress? whether salt stress has different effects on nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves?

salt stress in soil generally involves osmotic stress and ion-induced injury, and na+ is the main toxic ion in salinized soil. low na+ and high k+ in the cytoplasm are essential for the maintenance of a number of enzymatic processes. transmembrane k+ movements in plants are mediated by several types of channels, including the akt family, and by transporters that belong to two families, kcsa-trk  and kup/hak/kt . the extent of tolerance by plants to na+ stress depends on ion compartmentalization and exclusion. in higher plants, the salt overly sensitive protein  <dig>  functions in na+ exclusion from root epidermal cells into the rhizosphere, which also plays a role in retrieving na+ from shoots to roots
 <cit> . sos3–sos <dig>  protein kinase pathway mediates regulation of the expression and activities of na+ transporters such as sos <dig> and na+/h+ exchanger  that mediates na+ compartmentalization into vacuoles
 <cit> . in rice plants, a high affinity k+ transporter  family, oshkt1; <dig>  mediates na+ exclusion from shoots via na+ removal from the xylem sap
 <cit> .

plant roots absorb nitrate , ammonium , and other nutrients from soil using a variety of transporters. for example, amt protein family members transport nh4+ and nrt protein family members transport nitrate. no3– is reduced to nitrite by nitrate reductase  and then to nh4+ by nitrite reductase . nh4+ from both nitrate reduction and soil are incorporated into amino acid by glutamine synthetase  and glutamate synthase  or alternative glutamate dehydrogenase  pathway
 <cit> .

the study was designed to investigate whether salt stress has different effects on the ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in the old and young leaves of rice, and to compare functions of both organs in rice salt tolerance. the rice seedlings were subjected to salt stress. the contents of inorganic ions, nh4+-nitrogen, and no3−-nitrogen in old and young leaves were then measured. the expression of some critical genes involved in ion balance and nitrogen metabolism also were assayed to test their roles in salt tolerance.

RESULTS
ion accumulation
salt stress only slightly influenced accumulations of na+, k+, na+/k+ ratio, cl– and ammoniacal nitrogen in young leaves, but strongly stimulated their accumulation in old leaves . salt stress reduced no3− contents in both old and young leaves, with reduction in young leaves greater than in old leaves. although the no3− content was much higher in old leaves than young leaves under salt stress , substantial differences between both organs are not found in their so42- and h2po4− contents .

ion metabolism
salt stress slightly down-regulated the expression levels of oscbl <dig>  oshkt1; <dig> and osnhx <dig> in young leaves, while strongly stimulated their expression in old leaves . salt stress stimulated the expression of oshkt1; <dig> in young leaves but down-regulated its expression in old leaves . the expression of oshkt1; <dig> and oshkt2; <dig> in young leaves were lower than old leaves . expression levels of oshak <dig> and oshak <dig> in young leaves were down-regulated by salt stress, whereas their expression levels in old leaves were enhanced . salt stress mightily up-regulated expression of oshak <dig> in young leaves but reduced its expression in old leaves . the expression level of osakt <dig> in old leaves clearly decreased, while in young leaves increased .

nh4+ assimilation
effects of salt stress on the expression of osnr <dig>  osgs1; <dig>  osgs1; <dig>  osgs1; <dig>  osgdh <dig> and osgdh <dig> in young leaves were insignificant, while their expression in old leaves were strongly up-regulated . salt stress lowered the expression of osnir in old leaves, and enhanced its expression in young leaves. the expression levels of osnadh-gogat <dig>  osas, osgs <dig> and osfd-gogat in both organs were down-regulated by salt stress , while expression levels of the four genes all were much lower in old leaves than in young leaves. under control condition, expression level of osgs <dig> was much higher than other osgs family members . under salt stress, percent contribution of osgs <dig> to total osgs expression in young leaves still was much higher than other members; however, in old leaves, expression of all osgs <dig> gene family members were clearly up-regulated and resulted in the reduction of percent contribution of osgs <dig> .

nitrogen uptake
salt stress strongly stimulated the expression of osnrt1; <dig> in old leaves, but down-regulated the expression of osnrt2; <dig> in old leaves and up-regulated the expression of osnrt2; <dig> in young leaves . expression level of osamt1; <dig> was much higher than other amt gene family members . responses of osamt family members to salt stress were diverse. for example, salt stress strongly enhanced the expression of osamt1; <dig> in young leaves but up-regulated the expression of osamt2; <dig> in old leaves . in addition, salt stress strongly reduced the expression of osamt1; <dig>  osamt2; <dig>  osamt3; <dig> and osamt3; <dig> in old leaves.

discussion
ion balance
salt stress has a more complex effect on the ion balance in rice old leaves than in young leaves. the results indicated that salt stress only slightly influenced the accumulations of na+, k+, cl− and ammoniacal nitrogen in young leaves, but salt stress strongly stimulated their accumulation in old leaves . interestingly, salt stress did not limit accumulations of so42- and h2po4− in rice leaves. it might be main reason for this that salt stress did not influence uptake of so42- and h2po4−. rice plants protected young leaves from ion injury via mightily accumulating toxicant ions in old leaves. mature leaves have a larger vacuole while young leaf cells only have dispersed miniature vacuoles
 <cit> . rice plants may transport toxicant ions  into the vacuoles of old leaves to alleviate the ion toxicity of whole plant.

under salt stress, na+ competes with k+ for uptake into roots
 <cit> . when na+ enters cells and accumulates to high levels, it becomes toxic to enzymes. tolerance of plants to na+ stress relies on na+ compartmentation at the cellular and tissue levels, na+ exclusion and the control of long-distance transport in vasculatures
 <cit> . salt overly sensitive  salt tolerance pathway may play important roles in na+ release from leaves to roots. it has been reported that rice oshkt1; <dig> mediates na+ release from shoots to roots
 <cit> . in higher plants, the na+/h+ exchanger  family mediates na+ compartmentalization into vacuoles
 <cit> . under salt stress, up-regulated osnhx <dig> expression might contribute to na+ compartmentalization in old leaves. up-regulation of oshkt1; <dig>  oshak <dig> and oshak <dig> may advance the accumulation of na+ in old leaves of salt stressed-rice . in addition, lower expression of oshkt1; <dig> and ossos <dig> in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving na+ from old leaf cells .

nitrogen metabolism
nitrogen metabolism regulation is of central importance for salt tolerance, and interference between salinity and nitrogen nutrition is a very complex network affecting almost all processes
 <cit> . our results indicated that salt stress has a stronger effect on nitrogen metabolism in old leaves than in young leaves. under salt stress, old leaves showed higher concentration of no3− content than young leaves. under salt stress, these scarce no3− may be principally stored in old leaves with larger vacuole to keep the no3− supply in shoots
 <cit> . the up-regulation of osnrt1; <dig>  a gene coding nitrate transporter, might advance the accumulation of no3− in the old leaves of salt stressed-rice. our results also showed that salt stress has different effects on osamt gene family expression of young and old leaves . this indicated that young and old leaves might have different nh4+ transmission mechanisms under salt stress.

it is well known that no3– is reduced to nitrite by nitrate reductase  and then to nh4+ by nitrite reductase . nh4+ is incorporated into amino acid by glutamine synthetase  and glutamate synthase  or alternative glutamate dehydrogenase  pathway 
 <cit> . glutamine synthetase  includes two isozymes: gs <dig> in the cytosol and gs <dig> in chloroplasts/plastids
 <cit> . osnadh-gogat is mainly expressed in roots and mediates assimilation of nh4+ in roots, and fd-gogat exists in chloroplast and functions in assimilation of nh4+ from photorespiration
 <cit> . our results indicated that the expression levels of osfd-gogat and osgs <dig> in old leaves were much lower than those in young leaves in response of rice plants to salt stress. the down-regulation of osgs <dig> and osfd-gogat in old leaves might be a harmful response to excesses of na+ and cl−. under salt stress, rice might accumulate na+ and cl− to toxic levels in old leaves . this might harm the chloroplast, influence photorespiration process, and reduce nh4+ production from photorespiration, which immediately down-regulates the osgs <dig> and osfd-gogat in old leaves of salt stressed rice . excesses of na+ and cl− even changed the pathway of nh4+ assimilation in old leaves, weakened gogat/gs pathway and elevated gdh pathway . we found that salt stress clearly elevated the expression levels of osgdh <dig> and osgdh <dig> in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated the expression of osgs <dig> and osfd-gogat in old leaves . in addition, salt stress could change spatial distribution of various members of same gene family at whole plant level. for example, osgs1; <dig> is present only in the spikelets
 <cit> , but salt stress strongly stimulated its expression in old leaves . under control condition, expression level of osgs <dig> was much higher than other osgs family members . under salt stress, percent contribution of osgs <dig> to total osgs expression in young leaves still was much higher than other members; however, in old leaves, expression of all osgs <dig> gene family members were clearly up-regulated and resulted in the reduction of percent contribution of osgs <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
salt stress has a more complex effect on the ion balance in rice old leaves than in young leaves. rice plants protect young leaves from ion injury via mightily accumulating toxicant ions in old leaves. mature leaves have a larger vacuole while young leaf cells only have dispersed miniature vacuoles. rice plants may transport toxicant ions  into the vacuoles of old leaves to alleviate the ion toxicity of whole plant. under salt stress, up-regulation of oshkt1; <dig>  oshak <dig> and oshak <dig> advances the accumulation of na+ in old leaves. in addition, lower expression of oshkt1; <dig> and ossos <dig> in old leaves decreases frequency of retrieving na+ from old leaf cells. excess of na+ weakens gogat/gs pathway and elevates gdh pathway in old leaves. the up-regulation of osnrt1; <dig> advances the accumulation of no3− in the old leaves of salt stressed-rice.
