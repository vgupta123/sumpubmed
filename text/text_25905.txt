BACKGROUND
the mechanisms of gene transcription can be understood by the identification of genetic variants regulating gene expression . recent eqtl studies have taken a genome-wide approach to simultaneously analyze thousands of expression traits  <cit> . for example, huang et al.  <cit>  have used gwas and expression data from hapmap individuals to identify several genetic variants that are associated with particular gene expressions related to pharmacogenomics. most findings of eqtl associations are considered to be cis-associations, a term used to indicate that the genetic variant is in, or near, the gene whose expression it regulates  <cit> . searching for cis-regulating snps is easier than searching for the opposite, trans-regulating snps, which regulate genes far from themselves, not only for the obvious reason that they are closer to the gene in question, but that this type of searching results in a lower multiple-testing correction and less type- <dig> errors  <cit> . the hundreds or thousands of common cis-acting variations that occur in humans may in turn affect the expression of thousands of other genes by affecting transcription factors, signaling molecules, rna processing, and other processes that act in trans  <cit> . indeed, recent research shows the promise of eqtl studies to elucidate the regulatory connections that feedback from metabolism to transcripts; thus the variations in enzyme loci can be among the most likely associations of eqtls  <cit> . for all these reasons, methods that can identify trans-acting eqtls are required to uncover the remaining biology of dna-transcript interaction.

identifying eqtls requires both snp and gene expression data in a single analysis to pinpoint the cis- and trans-snps modulating the expression levels. however, modern microarrays assay more than  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  genes in single chips, making direct inference of the causal interplay among such a large number of snps and genes a computationally infeasible task. to solve this problem, we look to information theory, and seek to construct a transcriptional information map . rna transcription is analogous to a communication system where the receiver  obtains messages from the sender  through a channel . information theory has developed sophisticated mathematical tools to describe the properties of channels connecting receivers to transmitters. it is therefore not surprising that information theory has been a major analytical tool in bioinformatics since its early beginnings. almost a decade ago, researchers at children’s hospital informatics program developed a highly successful information-theoretic method, known as relevance networks  <cit> , to determine the similarity of gene expression profiles. since then, information theory has been applied in virtually every aspect of bioinformatics  <cit> . for example, previous work has linked proteins in tissues to biolfuids via information theoretic channels  <cit> . recently, information theory has started to emerge in eqtl analysis  <cit> .

we extend this tradition by constructing a tim. information theory has provided a robust, principled framework to quantify the information flux which characterizes telecommunication channels  <cit> . similarly, information theory can be applied on genomic data to reverse engineer the transcriptional information flow. in our tims, we model each snp-gene pair as two nodes bridged by a channel, through which transcriptional information flows; this information is indicative of the strength or degree of gene regulation by the snp. analyzing the tim can cluster snps and genes into groups, where dependence exists within groups but not across groups. thus, causal analysis can be performed only within individual groups, resulting in the reconstruction of regulatory networks. we demonstrate how our approach can study transcription mechanisms in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia .

RESULTS
we have constructed a transcriptional information map  of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia , whose data was obtained from the gene expression omnibus   <cit> . in this data,  <dig> patients were genotyped at  <dig>  snps using affymetrix human mapping 100k set microarrays, and the expression patterns of  <dig>  genes were profiled using affymetrix hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  platforms.

tim of pediatric all
the transcriptional information of snp-gene pairs was quantified by mutual information. to account for noise in the data, we used a permutation test to determine the noise level, and found that a mutual information score of  <dig>  or below in the all data could be attributed to noise. therefore, we consider a transcriptional channel to exist between a snp and a gene when their mutual information is above  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows a portion of the tim between snps on chromosome 21q <dig> and genes on chromosome 21q11-q22; in the figure, the red squares denote snps, and blue circles denote genes. the map displays existing transcriptional channels, represented by the straight lines, where the color of each line represents the signal strength of each channel as mutual information.

cis/trans regulatory analysis
the tim in figure  <dig> is a tool to identify cis- and trans-eqtls. from the map, we can trace which snps are linked to the genes of our interests, resulting in the recognition of candidate genomic locations whose genotypes significantly affect expression of the genes. for example, the tim shows multiple eqtls of jam <dig>  which was reported to be associated with leukemia in copy number variation studies  <cit> . our analysis indicates that the structural genetic variations can induce changes in expression of jam <dig>  which in turn may be a source of leukemia pathogenesis. another gene indicated by our tim is adamts <dig>  which encodes a member of the adamts  protein family. it is located on chromosome 21q <dig> , and its activation has been linked to cardiovascular disease. a study has recently found up-regulation of adamts <dig> in pediatric all samples  <cit> , most likely due to methylation of adamts <dig> <cit> . with reference to the tim shown in figure  <dig>  it is not surprising that adamts <dig> has a number of cis-eqtls on chromosome 21q <dig>  confirming that its regulatory mechanisms are due to snps residing in its neighborhood  <cit> . however, the trans-genomic regulation of this gene by snps has not been previously investigated. the tim further shows that gene adamts <dig> also has strong association with snps on cytobands q <dig> and q <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  in addition to its known association with snps on cytoband q <dig>  we have also found multiple snps on q <dig> and q <dig> with strong linkage to adamts <dig> – these indicate that the q <dig> and q <dig> regions of chromosome  <dig> are candidate trans-eqtls.

a number of genes exist in the same cluster of adamts <dig>  including, for example, gart, pcp <dig>  dscam, and ripk <dig>  all of these genes have similar cis- and trans-loci; they share 70% of linked snps in common. in this cluster, adamts <dig> and gart are known cancer biomarkers in all  <cit> . the involvement of pcp <dig> in osteogenesis explains that abnormal bone marrow production leads to leukemia  <cit> . dscam and ripk <dig> have known relations to down’s syndrome  <cit> ; since the association of down's syndrome and leukemia has been documented for over  <dig> years  <cit> , it is not surprising that dscam and ripk <dig> are also grouped in this cluster.

causal regulatory analysis
discussion
we have presented a general framework, based on the well-established mathematics of information theory, to create a map of the relationships linking genetic variations to gene expression and regulation. we applied our methods to the analysis of genotype and gene expression for eqtl identification, where we found several established and putative eqtls in leukemia cells. our results have been based on a partial transcription information map, while we anticipate the full tim of leukemia will enable the identification of many new eqtls, and subsequent experiments to test causal connections between genetic variants and gene expression and regulation.

however, tims need not be limited to snp and gene expression data; other genetic data modalities are equally appropriate. for example, other genetic datasets may contain copy number variation, dna methylations, micrornas, or exon splicing information. with sufficient computation power, particularly parallel architectures, whole genome transcription maps can be constructed, from datasets such as the mouse phenome project . we expect that tims of various organisms, cells, or tissues will reveal new gene regulation mechanisms and foster the discovery and understanding of new molecular processes.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper presents an information theory approach to infer cis- and trans-eqtls from snp and gene expression microarrays. our method develops a mutual information formula between discrete and continuous variables. the mutual information captures transcriptional information flux between snps and genes, resulting in transcriptional information maps . further analyses of tims include grouping snps and genes into similar clusters, inferring causal regulation within groups, and abstracting meaningful biological networks. the application of our method on a pediatric leukemia study shows how the tim helps to find cis- and trans-eqtls and to extract modulation patters between snps and genes.
