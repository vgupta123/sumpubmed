BACKGROUND
breast cancer is the most common diagnosed malignancy in women, with over  <dig>  million new cases worldwide annually  <cit> . 75% of all breast cancers are from the luminal subtype  <cit>  for which tumour growth is thought to be dependent on the activity of the estrogen receptor alpha . this growth-dependency renders this pathway the main target for adjuvant endocrine treatment in luminal breast cancer.

the physiological behaviour of the erα involves binding of the receptor to its natural ligand estradiol, after which the receptor associates to the chromatin, recruits its coregulators and alters the transcriptional activity of responsive genes, leading to increased cell proliferation and tumour growth. in endocrine treatment of breast cancer, the activation of the receptor can be inhibited through multiple ways, each of which resulting in an inhibition of erα-driven cell proliferation. even though these endocrine intervention therapies greatly increase the disease-free survival and overall survival of breast cancer patients  <cit> , resistance to treatment is commonly observed. this resistance can be mediated through a multitude of different mechanisms, including differential expression of kinases  <cit> , coregulators  <cit>  and transmembrane receptors  <cit> .

importantly, it is becoming apparent that mechanisms of resistance may result from intrinsic effects on erα/chromatin interactions, as shown both in cell lines  <cit>  and in tumour samples  <cit> . since the erα/chromatin interactome directly determines the estradiol-mediated effects on gene expression  <cit> , distinct binding patterns may be a key-defining factor for deviating gene expression patterns as well  <cit> . a major hurdle to assay such transcription factor/chromatin interactions, is the frequently very limited starting material due to the minimal amount of tissue that is obtained during diagnostic work-up.

recently approaches have been described to map histone modifications in a limited amount of starting material  <cit> , but no such protocol has been described for transcription factors. similarly, new methods for amplification of limited material have been described  <cit> , but these assume that sufficient dna was recovered from the chip to enable amplification in the first place. one of the major technical limitations has been enriching sufficient dna  from limited starting material. this problem has been addressed using ‘carrier chromatin’  <cit> , a strategy that is not amenable to global sequencing approaches. here, we describe a procedure to enhance transcription factor chip-seq by incorporating a modified carrier method to enable chip-seq from limited starting material. we apply this method to map the erα/chromatin interactome in as few as  <dig>  tissue culture cells and apply this technology to map the erα chromatin binding landscape in core needle biopsy samples from breast cancer patients.

RESULTS
carrier selection for small cell number chips
to optimize the chromatin immunoprecipitation  procedure from a limited amount of cells, we utilized the well-characterized  breast cancer cell line mcf <dig>  mcf <dig> cells have been widely applied for chip-seq applications, and multiple datasets are publicly available to be used as a reference. proliferating mcf <dig> cells from a sub-confluent 10 cm dish were harvested, after which the total amount of cells were counted. the lysate from  <dig>  cells was used for chip. initially a focused erα chip-real time pcr approach was taken, using the well-studied ps <dig> promoter region. erα chip was performed using standard methods  <cit> , but in the absence of carrier, no enrichment from the chip sample was observed . in addition, two independent carriers were tested: glycogen and mrna/histones. the rationale was to test carriers that were either inert  or had a composition that could be removed from the sample . the carriers were added to the lysate mixture before antibody-conjugate addition. glycogen proved to have a small, but not significant increase in chip efficiency, when using the ps <dig> promoter region. the addition of recombinant histones and random human mrna led to a significant increase of erα signal at the ps <dig> promoter . this enhanced enrichment was achieved both by an increased chip efficiency for specific signal as well as a decrease of the nonspecific background binding . combining the two carrier procedures resulted in a decreased signal as compared to only adding mrna/histones.

even though the increased enrichment at the ps <dig> promoter was indicative of increased chip efficiency, this cannot be generalized towards all erα/chromatin interactions. therefore, the erα chip-samples were further processed and prepared for sequencing. only the two extreme conditions  were sequenced and compared to a publicly available dataset of proliferating mcf <dig> cells, performed on ~ <dig> million cells  <cit> . the carrier mrna and histone were degraded prior to amplification of enriched chip dna. an example of difference in binding capacity in the presence and absence of carrier mrna/histones is shown in figure 1b and all binding events are illustrated as a heatmap in figure 1c. importantly, we ranked all erα binding peaks observed in the sample with ~ <dig> million cells and found that ~60% of these were recapitulated when using the mrna and histones as carrier from  <dig>  cells. this is a substantial improvement compared to erα chip-seq without carrier, where only signal was detected at ~20% of peaks. heatmap visualisations and quantifications indicated that peak calling on  <dig>  cells with rna/histones carrier provided comparable signal intensity distributions as the saturated chip. this in contrast to the  <dig>  cells analysis without carriers  where mainly background was found. grouping the chip distributions on the basis of signal intensities showed that peaks with high-intensity signal under the rna/histones carrier chip conditions, consistently provided high signal distributions for the saturated chip, and vice versa . no subsets of false-positive and false-negative regions were observed . interestingly, the dynamic range of signal intensity as detected in the saturated chip was dampened under the carrier conditions . cumulatively, these data show that the addition of carrier chromatin facilitates transcription factor chip-seq from  <dig>  cells, without negatively effecting the amplification or global fidelity of the process.

in order to confirm the biological validity of the erα binding events mapped using mrna/histone as carrier for chip-seq from  <dig>  cells, we integrated the binding information with estrogen -mediated gene expression profiles. for all e2-regulated genes, we determined whether our altered chip protocol enabled the identification of proximal erα as compared to the saturated chip . we used a publically available gene expression microarray dataset, from mcf <dig> cells treated for 6 hours with e <dig>  <cit>  and found  <dig>  transcripts up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated by e <dig>  a window of 20 kb around the transcription start-site was applied to determine proximal erα binding . for the saturated chip-seq, approximately 60% of all e <dig> up- and downregulated genes had a proximal erα binding event , which is consistent with our previous report  <cit> . using the erα binding events discovered from  <dig>  cells with the mrna/histones as carrier, we found that 38% of the e <dig> up-regulated genes had an adjacent erα binding event , a figure under-represented because of the fewer erα binding events in this category. we also ranked the strongest gene-proximal erα binding events from the mrna/histone carrier-sample based on tag count, resulting in binding at well-described erα target genes, including tff <dig>  rara, greb <dig> and xbp <dig> .

carrier-chip from core needle biopsies of human breast tumours
given the findings that mrna/histone carrier appeared to assist chip-seq from limited cell numbers, we applied this approach to clinically relevant samples. we chose to study core needle biopsy samples from breast cancer patients, since they represent clinically available, but limited material that would be appropriate for our approach. these samples were all positive for estrogen receptor, as determined by immunohistochemistry . we tested the two carrier conditions independently;  <dig>  glycogen  <dig>  mrna in combination with recombinant histone 2b. erα chip-seq was performed in all core needle biopsies. when using glycogen as a carrier, a small level of enrichment was observed from the biopsy samples, as exemplified at multiple binding sites . importantly, in the presence of mrna/histone carriers, the enrichment at both the example regions and globally, was significantly increased. this resulted in  <dig> erα peaks in the presence of glycogen and  <dig>  peaks in the presence of mrna/histone carrier for two biopsies with directly comparable clinical parameters . importantly, in the presence of mrna/histone carrier, erα chip-seq signal was comparable to the level observed in the cell line , suggesting that the presence of the carrier enables increased erα chip-seq signal, even when applied to limited samples obtained from core needle biopsies.

erα binding events are rarely found at promoters  and the majority of binding sites is normally enriched at introns and distal intergenic regions  <cit> . we analysed the binding site localizations and found that the mrna/histones assisted chip-seq showed comparable genomic distributions compared to cell line data . motif analyses were performed for the mrna/histone assisted chip condition . as expected, er dna binding motifs were the most strongly enriched motifs.

since erα is the driving transcription factor in luminal breast cancer, we interrogated the genes proximal to the erα binding events, and determined whether these were previously identified as basal or luminal gene signatures in independent cohorts of breast cancer patients  <cit>  . for the glycogen carrier condition, none of these hallmark genes were found to have a proximal erα binding event for any of the tumour samples tested . for the mrna/histone-assisted condition, an enrichment of luminal genes was found over basal-signature genes . expression of these signature genes with proximal erα binding events was found to correlate with a favourable outcome after endocrine treatment in a meta-analysis of breast cancer patients with erα-positive disease  <cit>  , indicating that our carrier chip-seq protocol enabled us to identify direct erα target genes with clinical implications from core needle biopsy samples.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome-wide assessment of erα/chromatin interactions has been performed in tissue culture cell lines  <cit>  and primary breast cancer tissue  <cit> . even though chip-seq is a very powerful technology to delineate transcription factor-chromatin interactions and to identify specific locations of histone marks on a genome-wide level, the technology does have its intrinsic limitations. the availability of a specific antibody and applicable for immunoprecipitation from formaldehyde-fixed material are major limitations. in addition, there are potential issues related to epitope masking. another major limitation of chip-seq analyses is the need for a certain amount of starting material. reports have described chip-seq analyses on histone marks on limited starting material  <cit> , but these represent relatively stable covalent interactions, as compared to the dynamic and unstable interactions between transcription factors and chromatin. in directed chip analyses, the benefit of carrier during the immunoprecipitation procedure has proven to be substantial  <cit> . in that method, non-relevant chromatin , is added as a carrier during the procedure, in order to enhance the enrichment from the limited but relevant cellular material. while this approach can be applied for qpcr-chip, it is not readily applicable for chip-seq, which will sequence all dna, regardless of the species, resulting in substantial dilution of the relevant enriched dna. how the addition of the carriers exactly enhances the chip procedure on a molecular level still needs to be resolved. most likely, the bulky material of the carrier helps to retain the small amounts of relevant chromatin throughout the isolation procedure. in addition, it might prove an additional benefit of blocking nonspecific antibody/protein interactions, thereby increasing substrate specificity of the antibody in the reaction to reduce background signal.

here, we introduce a novel mode of carrier-assisted chromatin immunoprecipitation that can be applied to transcription factor mapping by chip-seq. the enrichment from limited cellular material is enhanced by the addition of mrna and recombinant histone protein, which function as a carrier. importantly, both components of the carrier can subsequently be removed and provide an approach that is cost effective, easily applied and applicable in next-generation sequencing reactions.

we applied this approach to map erα in  <dig>  asynchronous mcf <dig> cells, which results in an improved dna recovery, when compared to no carrier. although this recapitulated ~60% of the signal observed when performing erα chip-seq in saturating numbers of cells, these possessed all the expected characteristics of robust erα binding events. the dynamic range of the chip signal intensity was dampened under carrier conditions, possibly implying that weaker chip enrichment regions are enhanced in our method. furthermore, as a proof-of-principle, we applied our carrier-assisted chip protocol to limited material derived from core needle biopsy samples, isolated from breast cancer patients. again, the presence of the mrna/histone carrier resulted in increased erα chip-seq signal, allowing for discovery of clinically and biologically relevant erα regulatory domains from these samples. several approaches have been recently described  <cit>  that enhance amplification from limited dna. although these are powerful methods, they assume that there is sufficient dna enriched by chip, but currently, methods do not exist that enable the chip enrichment from limited material for integration with these novel amplification approaches. we believe that our modified carrier chip-method improves the ability for purifying transcription factor-associated dna from limited material, such as tumour samples. the potential exists for coupling our modified chip approach with the novel amplification methods for greater chip-seq fidelity and signal from primary material, potentially permitting high-resolution transcription factor mapping even from clinical samples.
