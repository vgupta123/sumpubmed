BACKGROUND
shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> is a dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium  <cit>  and can use under anoxic conditions insoluble fe and mn oxide minerals as electron acceptors  <cit> . in the laboratory, s. oneidensis mr- <dig> forms biofilms under hydrodynamic flow conditions on a borosilicate glass surface, where biofilm formation is mediated by a set of complementary molecular machineries, comprised of the type iv msha pilus and a putative exopolysaccharide biosynthesis  gene cluster  <cit> . the first gene of this cluster is mxda, which is predicted to encode for a gene with unknown function; however, mxda was recently shown to control indirectly cellular levels of c-di-gmp in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit> . mxdb has homology to a membrane-bound type ii glycosyl transferase and was thought to be involved in the transport of extracellular material involved in forming the matrix of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> biofilms. this hypothesis was supported by genetic analysis revealing that ∆mxdb mutants were unable to transition from a cell monolayer to a three dimensional biofilm structure  <cit> . mxdc shares homology with an efflux pump and mxdd was annotated as a conserved hypothetical protein with no known homology. ∆msha∆mxdb double mutants were entirely deficient in initial attachment and biofilm formation  <cit> . expression of adhesion factors such as eps are regulated in vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa in response to environmental factors. the vps gene cluster in v. cholerae, for example, was shown to be controlled in a cell- density dependent manner  <cit>  involving several two-component signaling systems .

the global regulator arca is part of the arcs/arca two-component regulatory system in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit> . recently, it was shown that phoshorylation of arca by arcs requires the presence of hpta, a separate phosphotransfer domain  <cit> . hpta of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> shares homology with the n-terminal domain of arcb, the sensor histidine kinase of the e. coli arcb/arca system, but does not share significant homology with arcs from s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  arcs/hpta have been shown to functionally complement an e. coli Δarcb mutant  <cit> . in e. coli, arca is part of the arcb/arca  two-component regulatory system, a major regulator of gene expression involved in aerobic/anaerobic respiration and fermentative metabolism  <cit> . a recent study investigated the domain structure of arcs in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> and revealed significant differences when compared to e. coli arcb  <cit> . it was shown that in the n-terminal part, arcs possesses a cache-sensing domain, two cytoplasmic pas-sensing and two receiver domains. due to the expanded sensory region, arcs of shewanella species might be able to respond to a wider array of environmental signals and is not restricted to changing redox conditions.

arca has been previously shown to play a role in biofilm formation in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  s. oneidensis mr- <dig> ∆arca mutants form biofilms with about 70% less biomass on a borosilicate glass surface under hydrodynamic flow conditions and are unable to mature into a highly three-dimensional biofilm structure when compared to wild type  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated physiological and genetic factors involved in the regulation of the mxd operon in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  we found that mxd expression was induced by carbon starvation. the tcs arcs/arca was discovered to constitute a major activator of the mxd genes under biofilm conditions, and to repress mxd expression under planktonic conditions. bara/uvry was identified as a major inducer of mxd expression under planktonic conditions and appeared to have a minor role in biofilm formation.

RESULTS
∆mxda and ∆mxdb mutant cells are deficient in cell-cell aggregation when grown planktonically under minimal medium conditions
wild type s. oneidensis mr- <dig> cells, when grown for  <dig> h in a liquid minimal medium, formed a thick biofilm ring at the air-liquid interface on the borosilicate surface of a test tube . stationary phase cultures  aggregated in a rotating culture test tube and quickly settled to the bottom of the tube when rotation was arrested for  <dig> minutes . we took advantage of this aggregation phenotype and developed a quantitative aggregation assay by calculating the ratio of the optical density, measured at  <dig> nm, of cells before and after dispersion by rigorously vortexing . analyzing wild type and mutants by this assay, we found ∆mxda and ∆mxdb mutant cultures to be deficient in aggregation . consistent with this observation, the biomass of biofilms of these strains that formed at the air-liquid interface on the borosilicate glass test tube surface was dramatically reduced relative to wild type. notably, the described aggregation and adhesion phenotypes were not observed under lb medium conditions.

these data indicate a possible role for mxda and mxdb in cell-surface adhesion when growing in minimal medium. when comparing growth rates in lb to minimal medium, we found no correlation between growth rate and mxd expression, suggesting that a low growth rate, as found under starvation conditions in minimal medium, was most likely not responsible for mxd induction .

we therefore hypothesized that limitation for essential nutrients or accumulation of metabolites might be involved in mxd induction, and specifically tested whether carbon or nitrogen limitation induced mxd expression. for this purpose we constructed a wild type mxd::lacz reporter strain  . this strain was grown in lb medium to an od600= <dig> . cells were pelleted, resuspended in minimal medium amended with  <dig> mm sodium lactate, incubated for  <dig> minutes at 30°c and subsequently assayed for specific β- galactosidase activity. similarly, cells were also exposed to minimal medium without carbon or nitrogen source. as a control, cells were resuspended in the same lb culture medium. as shown in figure  <dig> no increase in mxd expression was observed when cells were incubated in the lb culture medium for  <dig> minutes  and compared to the same sample at t= <dig> minutes. similarly, cells exposed to minimal medium void of a nitrogen source also did not show any increase in mxd expression. cells exposed to minimal medium supplemented with lactate led to minor mxd induction. however, shifting cells to minimal medium void of a carbon source led to significant mxd induction . thus, starvation for carbon appears to be important for mxd expression in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> 

arcs/arca functions as a repressor of the mxd operon in planktonic cells
tn <dig> mutagenesis was performed to identify genes regulating mxd expression. we subjected the wild type mxd::

lacz reporter strain  to four independent rounds of tn <dig> transposon mutagenesis. a total of  <dig>  tn <dig> insertion mutants were qualitatively screened for deregulated mxd expression by visually comparing colours of kan-resistant colonies plated on x-gal plates relative to the parental strain.  <dig> out of  <dig>  tn <dig> insertion mutants were identified either as a loss- or gain-of-function mutants, respectively. after quantitative confirmation of the tn <dig> mutant phenotypes by β-galactosidase assays , tn <dig> insertion sites were mapped. among the selected tn <dig> mutants, we found in two independent mutageneses insertions in the response regulator arca and its cognate histidine sensor kinase arcs associated with a gain-of-function phenotype. in order to exclude polar effects due to the tn <dig> insertions, we constructed in a wild type background marker-less in-frame deletions of arcs  and arca , respectively . we then introduced the mxd::lacz construct into these strains to generate strains as <dig> and as <dig>  respectively, and examined mxd expression in these mutants when grown under lb medium conditions. as data in figure  <dig>  show, a  <dig> times higher mxd expression in exponentially growing cells and about  <dig>  times higher mxd expression in stationary phase cells was observed relative to wild type. our data show that arcs/arca is a major transcriptional repressor of mxd under planktonic conditions, and represses the mxd operon primarily in exponentially growing cells.

further support for a direct role of the arcs/arca system in control of mxd expression comes from a mxd promoter deletion analysis. the mxd transcription start site  was experimentally determined by primer extension analysis and mapped at - <dig> bp . in silico analysis of the mxd promoter predicted putative arca binding sites at - <dig> bp, - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp upstream of the mxd transcription start site . in order to experimentally test these predictions, we created truncations in the putative mxd promoter region, and transcriptionally fused the truncated promoters to lacz, yielding strains as832- <dig>  . all strains were grown in lb medium, and cells from early exponential phase  through late stationary phase  were harvested

 and assayed for β-galactosidase activity . interestingly, when deleting the region upstream of - <dig> bp from the transcriptional start site , expression was increased about eightfold during exponential growth phase  compared to reporter strains carrying mxd upstream regions deleted to - <dig> bp  and - <dig> bp  . as the arca binding sites were predicted at - <dig> bp, - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp upstream of the mxd transcriptional start site, the predicted - <dig> bp arca binding site is deleted in the - <dig> bp reporter strain , thus abolishing putative arca binding. collectively, the observed data are consistent with the hypothesis that arcs/arca is a major transcriptional repressor of the mxd operon under planktonic conditions.

bara/uvry is a major activator of mxd expression in planktonic cells
in the above reported transposon mutageneses, we also identified uvry  to transcriptionally control mxd. recently biochemical evidence showed that bara

 is the cognate sensor histidine kinase of uvry, and that bara/uvry in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> constitute a functional two-component regulatory system  <cit> . we therefore constructed markerless in-frame deletions of bara  and uvry , inserted the mxd::lacz construct into each strain, and determined mxd expression in strains as <dig>  and as <dig>  under lb medium conditions . as evident from figure  <dig> , both ∆bara and ∆uvry mutants showed drastically reduced mxd expression primarily in stationary phase. furthermore, we observed that ∆bara and ∆uvry mutant strains, when grown for  <dig> h under minimal medium conditions, failed to aggregate under planktonic conditions, similar to a ∆mxdb  mutant . these data provide genetic evidence that bara/uvry might function as an activator of the mxd operon under planktonic growth conditions. this conclusion is further supported by the observation that ∆bara and ∆uvry mutants exhibit a ∆mxdb phenotype when grown planktonically in minimal medium.

arcs/arca and bara/uvry regulate formation of hydrodynamically-grown biofilms
the above data showed that arcs and arca act as repressors of mxd expression, whereas bara and uvry strongly activate mxd expression under planktonic growth conditions. we next examined whether these regulators have a function under biofilm conditions. biofilms of wild type, ∆arcs, and ∆arca mutants were grown under hydrodynamic biofilm conditions, and biofilms were imaged by clsm at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-inoculation. interestingly, both ∆arcs and ∆arca mutant biofilms were unable to form a three-dimensional biofilm structure, and their biofilms were of similar structure as mxd mutant biofilms . as this finding was opposite to what we had expected based on the ∆arcs and ∆arca mutant phenotypes in planktonic cells, we examined whether the biofilm phenotype of ∆arcs  and ∆arca  mutants was indeed due to down-regulation of mxd. a transcriptional pmxd::gfp reporter strain was constructed and introduced into wild type , ∆arcs  and ∆arca , respectively. biofilms of wild type , ∆arcs  and ∆arca  carrying the pmxd ::gfp reporter were grown for  <dig> h in lm medium, harvested from the flow chamber and analyzed by flow cytometry for gfp fluorescence intensity . to account for non-specific background signals, a wild type strain carrying a promoterless gfp -reporter construct  was used as a control. while on average about 40% of the cells derived from a wild type biofilm showed pmxd-dependent gfp fluorescence above background, only about 1% of the cells from ∆arcs and ∆arca biofilms did so , consistent with the previously observed biofilm defect. these data provide evidence at the level of global biofilm structure as well as of single cell gene expression that arcs/arca is necessary for significant positive activation of mxd expression in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> 

∆bara and ∆uvry mutants formed well-developed three-dimensional structures that were less compact compared to wild type . these data therefore suggest that bara/uvry plays only a minor regulatory role under biofilm conditions.

discussion
carbon starvation induces mxd gene expression in s. oneidensis mr-1
while investigating physiological factors inducing mxd expression in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  we discovered that expression of the mxd genes in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> were regulated differentially depending on whether carbon starvation conditions prevailed under planktonic or biofilm conditions . the data showed furthermore that arca/arcs as well as bara/uvry are important regulators of mxd expression although under different conditions .

consistent with our data, earlier findings in p. aeruginosa and e. coli had shown that nutrient-depletion

 enhanced biofilm formation, while high concentrations of nutrients repress the formation of biofilms  <cit> . in nature, accessible organic carbon is often scarce and can be found sorbed to surfaces such as organic-rich flocculates of marine snow and fecal pellets. being able to sense and respond to changing carbon concentrations in these environments is crucial to the survival of bacteria. while starvation for carbon generally leads to a decrease in growth rate and metabolic activity in bacteria, our data suggest that s. oneidensis mr- <dig> cells activate production of adhesion factors responsible for biofilm formation under these conditions. this acclimation strategy could potentially confer an ecological advantage for s. oneidensis mr- <dig> cells interacting with a carbon rich surface, as they are already primed for adhesion.

bara/uvry functions as an activator of the mxd genes under planktonic growth conditions and has a role in the regulation of biofilm formation
we showed here that bara/uvry activates mxd expression under organic rich medium conditions when planktonic cells entered stationary phase . bara/uvry is highly conserved in gram-negative bacteria, and controls a variety of physiological functions including carbon storage  <cit> . in carbon storage regulation  bara/uvry regulates small rnas controlling elements of this pathway, which are major posttranscriptional regulators of biofilm formation in e. coli <cit> . the stimuli for the bara sensor histidine kinase in e. coli are aliphatic carboxylic acids, such as formate, acetate, propionate and others, providing a physiological signal reflecting the metabolic state of cells and thereby linking posttranscriptional control by the csr system with central metabolism  <cit> .

interestingly, s. oneidensis mr- <dig> biofilms of both ∆bara and ∆uvry mutants formed less compact biofilms when grown under hydrodynamic flow conditions. based on these data and the above discussed findings that low carbon concentration induces mxd expression, we hypothesize that bara might function as a sensor for carbon starvation, e.g., at high cell density when nutrients become growth limiting in planktonic culture. we hypothesize that under these conditions starvation-sensing bara signals to uvry, which, in return, directly or indirectly activates mxd expression and, by this cascade, controls biofilm formation. homologous of bara/uvry have been shown to control secondary metabolism, including the excretion of biofilm exopolysaccacharides in other γ-proteobacteria  <cit> . in the closely related bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens

 production of several antibiotic-like secondary metabolites is regulated by the orthologs gaca/gacs and via the small rnas rsmxyz  <cit> . in p. fluorescens expression of these small rnas was found to be positively controlled by gacs/gaca at high cell density and intermediates of central metabolism such as 2-oxoglutarate, succinate and fumarate which may be present at elevated intracellular concentration under conditions when cells are electron acceptor-limited  <cit> . it is conceivable that s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  similar to p. fluorescens, senses its metabolic state at the level of primary metabolites, and uses the level to control aspects of secondary metabolism including biofilm formation. the bara/uvry system and its components have been studied to some extent in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit> . it was found to contain all major components of the bara/uvry/csr pathway. uvry in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> positively regulates the two small rnas, csrb <dig> and csrb <dig> and a corresponding csra ortholog was also identified. the transcriptional fusion construct used in our study, which contains the mxd shine dalgarno sequence, is able to reflect control in mxd expression on the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. therefore, the decreased mxd expression detected in the bara and uvry mutants might be a result of transcriptional regulation by uvry which directly or indirectly interacts with the mxd promoter or a posttranscriptional control possibly via csra or both.

interestingly, s. oneidensis mr- <dig> biofilms of ∆bara and ∆uvry mutants were only partially defective . these biofilm defects might be a consequence of the idiosyncrasy of a biofilm environment: microbial biofilms are nutrient-stratified environments where cells at the surface of the biofilm have better access to nutrients, including oxygen, whereas cells in the layers distant from the planktonic interface become increasingly nutrient limited. if the bara/uvry system responds to lower concentrations of organic substrates, this regulator might be activated in the deeper, nutrient-deprived layers of the biofilm. consequently, in the absence of bara or uvry part of the biofilm population would not express the mxd genes and confer adhesion, leading to a loosely structured biofilm such as observed in ∆bara and ∆uvry mutants.

the arcs/arca tcs functions as a repressor of the mxd genes under planktonic growth conditions and activates the mxd operon in a biofilm
we identified and showed here that the arcs/arca system controls mxd expression in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  even though a role for arca in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> biofilm formation was previously introduced, no mechanistic explanation was provided. our data show that arcs/arca act as a repressor of the mxd genes under planktonic conditions  while it activates mxd expression in the biofilm .

the two different modes of action under planktonic and biofilm conditions could be explained as a consequence of additional mxd regulation at the transcriptional level. unidentified transcriptional regulators could alter the transcriptional mxd output we observe in ∆arcs and ∆arca mutants under planktonic and biofilm conditions. due to the ecological differences that cells experience in planktonic culture and in a biofilm, the response in terms of mxd expression would then be very different. a further possibility is that arca receives signal inputs from other sensor kinases in addition to arcs. lassak et al. provided biochemical evidence showing that the arcs/arca tcs in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> is only functional in the presence of a phosphotransfer domain hpta  <cit> . the function of phosphotransfer domains is not entirely clear, but they are thought to serve as a means to integrate signal inputs from several sensor kinases and relay that information to the cognate response regulator. depending on whether a cell experiences planktonic growth conditions or is part of a structured biofilm, the input signals can vary greatly, and, as a consequence, mxd expression can be very different in these environments. further investigation will be

 necessary to determine the differences in mxd regulation by arcs/arca under planktonic conditions and in a biofilm. additionally, based on the provided evidence we cannot entirely exclude that arcs/arca regulation of the mxd operon is indirect. biochemical analysis will have to be performed to show direct interaction of arca with the mxd promoter.

the signal input for the arcs sensor kinase in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> has not yet been identified. the sensor kinase arcb in e. coli responds to changes in oxygen

 availability by sensing the redox state of the quinone pool. based on the homology of the two arc systems, it is possible that arc has a similar function in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  to test whether expression of the mxd operon was regulated in response to metabolic changes, and more specifically to redox changes , via the arc system, experiments with s. oneidensis mr- <dig> wild type strains carrying a copy of lacz fused to the mxd promoter under controlled chemostat-like conditions had been conducted. strains were cultivated in a batch fermenter in lb medium or lb medium amended with  <dig> mm sodium fumarate and grown aerobically  to exponential phase and then shifted to anoxic growth conditions by depleting oxygen. β-galactosidase activity in these strains was monitored before and up to  <dig> hours after the shift. no change in mxd expression was observed upon oxygen depletion . this led us to the conclusion that a change in redox conditions and metabolic activity per se  did not play a role in arc mediated mxd regulation. based on recently published data, revealing that shewanella arcs possesses additional sensory regions when compared to arcb in e. coli, the arc system in shewanella species might also be able to sense other unknown environmental signals  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the presented data show that carbon starvation is the dominant environmental cue triggering mxd induction in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  and that the mxd genes are controlled transcriptionally by arcs/arca and bara/uvry. interestingly, bara/uvry appears to be a major regulator of the mxd genes and is primarily responsible for induction in cells that have entered stationary phase and are exposed to starvation conditions while arcs/arca appears to control mxd expression independent of growth phase. although the signal for the bara sensor histidine kinase has not been identified in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  it is reasonable to speculate that it is of similar molecular nature as the recently identified metabolites for e. coli bara. however, considering that e. coli and s. oneidensis mr- <dig> inhabit different ecological niches, it is also conceivable that the signal input might be different. thus, we hypothesize that based on our data carbon starvation could be the physiological signal sensed by bara directly or indirectly. both ∆bara and ∆uvry mutants were unable to induce mxd expression when cells entered stationary phase. in fact, mxd expression in both mutants resembles the expression level observed in logarithmically growing wild type cells, indicating a possible role for bara/uvry in starvation response.
