BACKGROUND
the mitochondrial dna referred to as the kinetoplast  is a spectacular structure that comprises approximately 20–25% of the total cellular dna in trypanosoma cruzi, a member of the flagellated protozoans of the order kinetoplastida  <cit> . the equally dramatic process of rna editing is also found in this specialized subcellular compartment, and the two are intimately associated. the kdna is comprised of two classes of circular dna molecules that are catenated and compressed into a disc-like structure. maxicircles are the functional equivalent of the mitochondrial dna of other eukaryotes, containing genes for mitochondrial rrnas and hydrophobic mitochondrial proteins mostly involved in the membrane-bound oxidative phosphorylation pathway  <cit> . at first glance the maxicircle genomes appear to lack several genes that are hallmarks of other mitochondrial genomes, while other genes are missing elements key to their translation such as initiation codons or contiguous orfs. post-transcriptional uridine insertion/deletion rna editing resolves most of these problematic issues, by creating start codons  <cit> , correcting internal frameshifts , and extensively modifying otherwise unrecognizable mrna transcripts to create entire orfs  <cit>  . the mechanistic process of rna editing is the subject of intense study in t. brucei and leishmania tarentolae  <cit> .

the heterogeneous minicircle population makes up the bulk of the kdna mass with tens of thousands of copies per network, and carries the specific information for rna editing in the form of guide rnas . a handful of grnas are also encoded on the maxicircle, with  <dig> thus far identified in l. tarentolae and three in t. brucei  <cit> . the grnas interact with the mrna templates through hybridization to dictate the precise location and number of uridine insertions or deletions; the interaction is tolerant of wobble base pairing of g-u, in addition to the standard watson-crick pairs. the level of sequence variability permissible in the grna pool with no loss of functional information is impressive, as any pairing with g or u residues in the mrna are unaffected by transition mutations in the grna. this leads to tolerance of sequence divergence while maintaining function, as evidenced by the lack of cross-recognition of the grnas from two strains  of t. cruzi  <cit> . the minicircle variable regions that encode the grnas have been used as molecular markers for strain genotyping and comparison  <cit> . the minicircle population of t. cruzi is highly variable between strains and evolves rapidly over time, allowing differentiation of closely related strains  <cit> .

t. cruzi is the causative agent of human chagas disease, affecting millions throughout the american continents, and is estimated to kill  <dig>  people per year  <cit> . the infection is spread by introduction of vector insect contaminated feces into an open wound or mucus membrane of the victim. once inside the human host, t. cruzi infects macrophages and replicates aggressively, producing high titers of parasite in the bloodstream that then spread throughout the tissues of the body. approximately 5% of infected individuals die in this acute stage. ultimately the infection will enter a quiescent phase that can last for decades, characterized by a low blood titer of the parasite and no overt symptoms. in 30% of the cases, clinical pathologies will eventually develop after 20+ years, reflecting a preference for cardiac and smooth muscle tissue by the parasite. chronic phase chagasic patients may die from one of a suite of mega syndromes affecting the heart, esophagus, or colon. while the factors determining development of these specific syndromes is not understood, the genetics of both the host and the parasite play roles in the outcome  <cit> .

unraveling the genetics of t. cruzi has been a major endeavor for decades. currently t. cruzi is partitioned into two groups  <cit>  that can be subdivided into six subgroups or discrete typing units  designated i, iia, iib, iic, iid, and iie  <cit> . nuclear markers indicate that homozygous dtus iia and iic are the result of a relatively ancient hybridization event between strains of dtus i and iib; the extensively heterozygous dtus iid and iie are products of a more recent hybridization event and possess two alleles similar to those found in dtus iib and iic at most loci  <cit> . the reference strain chosen for the t. cruzi genome-sequencing project, cl brener, is a member of dtu iie. sequencing of esmeraldo, a homozygous dtu iib strain, was undertaken to aid in resolution of ambiguity in the assembly of the cl brener genome.

the influence of a persistent t. cruzi infection in development of chronic stage of chagas disease is the subject of debate, since the direct cause of pathogenesis has yet to be determined conclusively  <cit> . essentially, there are two alternative hypotheses: 1) the presence of the parasite itself results in destruction of infected tissues, versus 2) infection by the parasite triggers an autoimmune response against cells not necessarily harboring active infections. in addition to a multitude of protein antigens  <cit> , an alternative stimulus for initiation of the autoimmune response has been proposed. during the cellular invasion process, dna from the parasite is integrated into the host genome. the dna species implicated in this horizontal transfer event is the minicircle  <cit> . whether this is a benign byproduct of infection, or a potential link to chagas disease pathology, the function of t. cruzi kdna is relevant to understanding parasite biology and the host-parasite relationship.

genetic variation in the t. cruzi maxicircle will be subject to more stringent selection pressure due to the presence of structural genes compared to the transition-tolerant grnas largely carried in the minicircles, and should provide phylogenetically meaningful markers. maxicircle genes from t. brucei and l. tarentolae have been determined, showing that gene order, or synteny, is conserved  <cit> . estimates of the total size of the t. cruzi maxicircle fall between  <dig> and  <dig> kb by various methods  <cit> , and a fragment of maxicircle from the tulahuen strain was sequenced  <cit> . assorted fragments of maxicircles from several t. cruzi strains have been examined for taxonomic studies  <cit> . an extensive t. cruzi maxicircle survey examined a  <dig> -kb fragment, identifying a correlation between the dtus and three maxicircle clades  <cit> : clade a corresponded to dtu i, clade b to strains of dtus iia, iic, iid, and iie, and clade c was exclusive to dtu iib strains. the same association was observed in similar analyses  <cit> .

we present annotated sequences of the t. cruzi maxicircles for the cl brener  and esmeraldo  strains assembled from data generated by the tigr-sbri-ki t. cruzi sequencing consortium . the anticipated cohort of genes was present, and the non-coding regions of both strains were assembled. the coding region of each genome contained little or no single nucleotide polymorphism  variability, but do possess strain-specific insertion/deletion mutations . esmeraldo has a large deletion removing substantial portions of two adjacent genes. this study provides the framework for continued study of kdna biology, rna editing, and chagas disease pathology in t. cruzi.

RESULTS
two t. cruzi maxicircle assemblies
the t. cruzi genome project took the approach of whole-genome shotgun sequencing of clones from libraries of size-selected fragments from a total cell dna preparation with a minimum insert size of  <dig> kb. clones were sequenced from both ends, providing between  <dig> bp and  <dig> kb of primary sequence and a physical link between opposing end-sequenced mate pairs from each clone  <cit> . a blast search of the primary reads from this project identified sequences of the cl brener and esmeraldo strains with identity to maxicircle coding regions from t. cruzi and t. brucei. the chromosome shotgun or large insert clone-based sequencing strategies employed by the l. major and t. brucei genome projects would preclude the capture of maxicircles.

the kdna maxicircles of t. cruzi strains cl brener and esmeraldo have been assembled from whole-genome shotgun sequences . contigs assembled from the selected reads were merged to generate the maxicircle assembly covering the coding region, from which other contigs were added progressively based on mate pair information and identity to extend the assembly into the non-coding region. consensus sequences were generated from assembled contigs with an average of 32x and 60x coverage for the cl brener and esmeraldo maxicircles, respectively. assembly of both maxicircles was complicated by the presence of multiple variants due to apparent intrastrain heterogeneity of the maxicircle population. this variation was observed mainly in the non-coding region 4– <dig> kb upstream of the 12s rrna. due to the difficulty in assembly of the non-coding region, the total lengths of the maxicircles were estimated based on coverage values of the coding region, assuming relatively equal coverage throughout the entire maxicircle and a population of maxicircles of equal size. calculations based on these assumptions produce lengths of approximately  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb for cl brener and esmeraldo, respectively. our consensus cl brener and esmeraldo maxicircles represent one variant for each of the non-coding region, and alternative assemblies with different variants were also assembled  . the differential size of esmeraldo compared to cl brener results from a larger non-coding region with larger duplicated conserved elements within the variable region, while coding region size is comparable. polymorphisms in the non-coding regions likely represent natural variation within the multi-copy maxicircle population within each kinetoplast and among cells in culture, similar to the variation seen amongst multi-copy nuclear gene arrays  <cit> .

the annotation of gene positions and lengths in the two t. cruzi maxicircles based on annotation of t. brucei and l. tarentolae is listed in table  <dig>  the order of the rrnas and genes on the t. cruzi maxicircle transcripts is syntenic with the t. brucei and l. tarentolae maxicircles. a 5736-nt fragment of the maxicircle coding region  that was cloned and sequenced from the tulahuen  strain  <cit>  shows 98% and 88% identity to cl brener and esmeraldo maxicircles over the same region. the boundaries of the c-rich region   <dig> gene in l. tarentolae has been determined  <cit> , but is not yet known for t. brucei; as the l. tarentolae sequence is divergent from t. brucei and t. cruzi, our annotation of this gene may be imprecise. maxicircle-encoded grnas are likely present in t. cruzi, but not yet included in the annotation, awaiting validation of actual rna editing events.

gene positions are given relative to the start of the 12s rrna

* murf <dig> start position is uncertain, so 5' end editing is assumed to create the start codon

** cr <dig> 5' and 3' end positions are uncertain, editing pattern, start, stop codons are unknown

the coverage of these genomes provides a high level of confidence in the assembled products. the cl brener nuclear genome was sequenced to approximately 7x coverage, and esmeraldo to  <dig> x coverage. despite this difference, the maxicircle genome coverage is deep for both strains. the high relative abundance of maxicircle sequences in the esmeraldo dataset suggests that the esmeraldo total cell dna preparation had a higher content of kdna relative to the cl brener starting material. the difference was probably due to loss of intact network during phenol extraction, and not representative of the relative amount of kdna in each strain.

nucleotide skew identifies gene orientation and editing locations
the t. cruzi maxicircle coding regions provide the primary templates for the rna editing process. using the maxicircle annotation for l. tarentolae and t. brucei the identification of orfs and 'cryptic' genes that are extensively edited at the rna level was straightforward. in comparative analyses cl brener was used as the t. cruzi reference sequence.

the nucleotide frequency and skew throughout the t. cruzi maxicircle coding region correlated with gene orientation and extent of editing. the coding region is 74% at-rich , reflecting the at-richness of the mitochondrial genome as a whole  <cit> . the at-skew plot demonstrates the bias towards a t-rich coding strand that is more pronounced in non-edited genes , as was also the case for t. brucei and l. tarentolae maxicircle genes  <cit> . the coding regions of extensively edited genes, which are comprised primarily of purines and have as much as half of the final edited mrna content contributed by inserted uridines, display low %ta. the non-edited genes produce u-rich mrnas similar in nucleotide content to extensively-edited mrnas following editing; their u-richness is encoded in the dna, lending support to the hypothesis that these genes were originally smaller, extensively-edited genes that were replaced by reverse-transcription of fully-edited versions by a retrotransposition event  <cit> . the gc skew plot illustrated a similar bias toward g-richness of the coding strand that is most pronounced in genes requiring extensive editing . the observed gc skew resulted in the original naming as g-rich or c-rich regions  <cit> . the skew is much greater in the coding region than for the maxicircle overall . the genes contain few c residues, suggesting a negative selection by the editing process that maintains cytosines only in regions where protein function and codon usage dictate their necessity. regions of extreme gc bias as represented by the peaks in the %gc plot corresponded to extensively edited genes referred to as c-rich  or g-rich  regions in t. brucei and l. tarentolae.

coding region region is defined as the contiguous nucleotide sequence of the maxicircle consensus from the start of 12s rrna through the end of the nd <dig> gene including intergenic regions, as defined for t. cruzi in table  <dig>  clb, esmo, tb, and lt represent t. cruzi cl brener strain, t. cruzi esmeraldo strain, t. brucei maxicircle coding sequence  and variant region sequence , and l. tarentolae maxicircle sequence 

similarity of rna editing in t. cruzi and t. brucei
the nucleotide skew analyses indicated that t. cruzi maxicircle coding regions have gc skew patterns suggestive of extensive editing of genes that are differentially edited in t. brucei and l. tarentolae. direct comparisons of the maxicircle genomes were performed to confirm this observation.

dot plot analyses of the cl brener maxicircle with t. brucei or l. tarentolae identified regions of sequence homology between the two genomes . each dot represents 100% identity over a 12-bp window. the formation of diagonal lines running through the plots indicated extended areas of high sequence identity. the diagonals were limited to the protein-coding regions, with breaks in the t. cruzi vs. l. tarentolae plot corresponding to genes that are edited to different extents at the rna level   <cit> . t. brucei showed greater overall sequence identity, represented by a diagonal line, matching cl brener throughout the coding region; thus t. cruzi exhibited primary sequences suggestive of the more enthusiastic use of the rna editing process as seen in t. brucei.

the sequences of the rrnas and coding regions of pan-edited and non-edited genes of the t. cruzi, t. brucei, and l. tarentolae maxicircles were aligned and percent identity determined. the extensively edited genes have lower percent identity levels on average than the non-edited genes, while rrnas showed the highest identities . in comparisons of t. cruzi to l. tarentolae the identity jumps from 42% for edited genes to 76% for non-edited genes, indicating that rna editing permits a greater genetic divergence at the level of the dna template between genera. identities for the rrnas and the non-edited genes do not differ greatly, supporting this thesis. however, alignment of edited rnas for l. tarentolae and t. brucei showed that differences at the dna level are decreased following editing, providing higher percent identity in the final products  <cit> . the t. cruzi maxicircle sequence indicated that nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  coiii, atpase <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  and rps <dig> are edited extensively as in t. brucei. potential t. cruzi-specific regions for editing are presented below.

a conserved element in the variable region of the non-coding sequences
assembly of the cl brener and esmeraldo maxicircles allowed us to examine intra-specific variation at the genomic level. as the mitochondrial dna of vertebrates is an excellent marker for intra-specific differences, the t. cruzi maxicircle is an interesting candidate for distinction between dtus, and has been used previously to distinguish three clades  <cit> . sequence differences were found in the gene-coding and non-coding regions. we begin with consideration of the non-coding regions where the sequences are most divergent.

the non-coding region differed significantly between cl brener and esmeraldo maxicircle assemblies and could be divided into regions that we refer to as 'variable' and 'repetitive' . the variable region was defined because several variants were assembled in cl brener and esmeraldo, with most of the variation occurring within 4– <dig> kb upstream of the coding region . a sequence element represented at least twice per maxicircle is conserved between the cl brener and esmeraldo maxicircles in this region . the core of the element was  <dig> bp with an average of 90% identity, dropping to an average of 87% over  <dig> bp and 77% over  <dig> bp among all variant contigs assembled for the two strains  . the cross structure present within the conserved element is due to a match to the reverse complement of a 39-bp sequence that forms an imperfect palindrome near the beginning of the conserved 97-bp core . cl brener has at least two imperfect copies of the element, of which the 3' copy has a 75-bp deletion in the 195-bp area. interestingly, this deletion removes the first six bases of the 39-bp palindrome. the two 97-bp cores present in the consensus sequences reside  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt upstream of the 12s rrna in cl brener, and  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt upstream of the 12s rrna in esmeraldo. our consensus assembly may under-represent the size of the variable region, meaning that a single maxicircle may contain more than two copies of this element. the presence of duplicated conserved elements in this region combined with intrastrain variability precluded conclusive consensus determination. alternative assemblies of this variable region produced catenated, tandem repeats with multiple copies of the conserved elements that are likely assembly artifacts not representative of an actual molecule .

conservation of the 325-bp element between cl brener and esmeraldo within the otherwise heterogeneous non-coding region implies a conserved function. a search for similar elements within the variable regions of t. brucei and l. tarentolae maxicircles, their entire genomes, and the ncbi databases, yielded no match. however, the element is in the same region upstream of the 12s rrna and shows a tandem organization similar to a duplicated sequence described in the variable region iii of the t. brucei maxicircle  <cit> . of the two copies in t. brucei, the 5' copy is longer, while the 3' copy is shorter, analogous to the pattern in cl brener. no sequence identity can be seen between the t. cruzi element and the t. brucei sequence, but the common organization within the non-coding regions is suggestive. the 39-bp palindrome sequence found in t. cruzi is an attractive candidate for a dimeric or multimeric protein complex binding site. a search for palindromes within the analogous tandem repeats of t. brucei revealed a 14-bp palindrome  present in both repeats. the t. brucei palindrome is shorter and of different sequence composition relative to the t. cruzi palindrome.

the repetitive portion of the non-coding region was visualized as a dense block of identity in dot plot analyses comparing this region to itself . in contrast to the variable region, the repetitive region showed no conservation between cl brener and esmeraldo, with unique repeated motifs of different size and sequence composition for each strain. small motifs were conserved within the repeated blocks of sequence for each strain . the cl brener repetitive region is composed of variants of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> bp. esmeraldo showed greater intrastrain variability with repeated elements of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> bp.

previous comparisons of repetitive region motifs found no conservation between t. brucei and l. tarentolae  <cit> . t. cruzi also shows no conservation of motifs between strains or among trypanosomatid species. all are a-rich with many tandem poly -tracts and a greater than average at skew . nucleotide composition analysis revealed a higher %at in the repetitive region than the coding region or the overall maxicircle sequence for all trypanosomatid maxicircle sequences . the variability of these repeats may be useful as specific strain or dtu markers.

variability in the t. cruzi coding regions
protein-coding regions provide specific markers for the variation among t. cruzi strains  <cit>  and, in contrast to the non-coding regions, they have a recognizable selective pressure. in considering the functional utility of the maxicircle as a molecular marker for strain identification and classification, the coding regions present variation that is likely conserved among dtus or subgroups of strains, while the variable regions may allow differentiation among closely related isolates. no significant variation was observed within the consensus assembly of the coding region of each strain, indicating high intra-strain homogeneity of the maxicircle population. the coding region showed high levels of identity between the two t. cruzi strains, with some 'editable' differences observed at snps and indels in poly  tracts within edited genes. comparisons of the coding regions from cl brener and esmeraldo showed identity ranging from  <dig> % for extensively edited genes, to  <dig> % for non-edited genes, to  <dig> % for rrnas . several examples of small indels as well as a substantial deletion within the coding region of the maxicircle with potential detrimental effects on protein translation will be described.

truncation of two esmeraldo maxicircle genes
the most pronounced coding-region difference between the two strains was a 236-nt deletion in esmeraldo relative to the cl brener maxicircle, resulting in 5'-end truncations of c-rich region  <dig>  and nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  . these two genes are transcribed on opposing strands in a head-to-head orientation, and the deletion eliminates the predicted initiation codons for both genes. esmeraldo nd <dig> lacked the first  <dig> nt of its coding region relative to cl brener . a downstream in-frame aug may allow for the expression of a truncated protein of  <dig> aa, compared to the 437-aa cl brener protein. the deletion leaves  <dig> nt of the former reading frame upstream of the potential start codon. the transmembrane prediction program tmpred  <cit>  indicated that the first two membrane spanning regions of nd <dig> to lie at aa 4– <dig> and aa 45– <dig>  thus the deletion eliminates the first predicted transmembrane domain.

the esmeraldo cr <dig> is missing the first  <dig> nt of its coding region as defined in cl brener . by analogy with the extensively edited t. brucei cr <dig>   <dig> nt of the edited orf would be lost. an in-frame aug,  <dig> nt downstream of the deletion, may allow for translation of a truncated protein of  <dig> aa, compared to  <dig> aa predicted for cl brener. tmpred predicts the first two transmembrane domains of cr <dig> to be at aa 4– <dig> and aa 32– <dig>  thus the truncated cr <dig> protein would lack the first transmembrane domain. the function of cr <dig> is unknown, but appears conserved with the t. brucei and l. tarentolae sequences that display 77% and 74% identity at the edited mrna and predicted protein levels, respectively.

a blast search using the corresponding region from cl brener confirmed that the deleted sequence is not present in any of the esmeraldo reads; greater than 50x regional coverage gives high confidence that the deletion is found in all esmeraldo maxicircles. to query directly the absence of this region in esmeraldo, we examined esmeraldo dna along with six additional dtu iib strains and  <dig> strains representing the five other dtus . pcr using primers flanking the esmeraldo deletion showed that only esmeraldo had this deletion, and no vestige of a full-length version was detected; neither of the dtu i representatives yielded amplification products, likely due to snp variation in the primer annealing site.

the unique appearance of this deletion in the esmeraldo strain suggests that it may be a recent event tolerated in a cultured strain, but deleterious in wild populations. the indels detailed in the following section point to additional anomalies in the esmeraldo maxicircle that may be incompatible with virulence of this strain.

nd <dig>  murf <dig>  and murf <dig> frameshifts
multiple additional small indels ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp were found in both t. cruzi strains in areas of genes not requiring rna editing in t. brucei or l. tarentolae , with the preponderance appearing in esmeraldo. none of the indels were shared between the strains, several of which result in the creation of premature termination codons.

the esmeraldo nd <dig>  which is not edited in t. brucei and seemingly does not require editing in cl brener, has three frameshift mutations relative to the cl brener sequence  the first is an insertion at position  <dig> resulting in the introduction of two in-frame stop codons 14- and 34-nt downstream. the reading frame is restored by a single nt deletion relative to the cl brener sequence at position  <dig>  another single nt deletion at position  <dig> again results in a frameshift that alters the remainder of the orf. thus esmeraldo nd <dig> translated directly from the dna sequence would generate a truncated protein of  <dig> aa compared to the  <dig> aa product of cl brener.

murf <dig> is not well annotated in other species. 5' editing could create the initiation codon, but no analogous start codon is annotated in t. brucei or l. tarentolae. we have used the largest continuous orf present in t. brucei to represent the start point for this gene. using the equivalent start position in t. cruzi, the cl brener murf <dig> codes for a  <dig> aa protein. esmeraldo murf <dig> contains two single-nt deletions at positions  <dig> and  <dig> relative to the cl brener sequence, both of which result in internal frameshifts . in addition, esmeraldo shows a 9-bp insertion at positions 1315– <dig>  the deletion at position  <dig> may have no effect, as the 5' end of the orf is undetermined. the frameshift at position  <dig> introduces an in-frame stop codon that would result in a product truncated by  <dig> aa relative to cl brener.

the t. brucei murf <dig> mrna is edited at the 5' end by the insertion of  <dig> uridine residues to create the initiation codon and the reading frame up to nt  <dig> of the orf. this localized editing appears to be conserved in t. cruzi; a conserved amino terminus can be predicted after hypothetical rna editing in both strains. however, cl brener and esmeraldo both show frameshift mutations in areas that are apparently not edited in t. brucei . the cl brener murf <dig> had a 4-nt insertion relative to t. brucei after nt  <dig> of the predicted edited orf, creating in a frameshift that introduces a premature stop codon. thus a 101-aa protein would result, containing the first  <dig> of  <dig> aa in common with t. brucei and l. tarentolae. the esmeraldo murf <dig> contained four insertion or deletion events relative to the t. brucei sequence: a 2-nt insertion at position  <dig>  a 9-nt deletion at  <dig>  and two single-nt deletions at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  cumulatively, these differences result in a frameshift starting at aa  <dig> and continuing through aa  <dig>  where the frame reverts to the t. brucei cadence, leaving  <dig> aa in the central portion of the 357-aa protein altered. approximately half of amino acids in this shifted region are conservative changes relative to cl brener.

discussion
we report the complete maxicircle consensus sequences from two strains of t. cruzi that are syntenic with the coding regions of maxicircles in t. brucei and l. tarentolae. all three mitochondrial genomes contain  <dig> protein-coding genes and two rrnas. strain-specific frame shifts were documented in several t. cruzi genes at positions not edited in other kinetoplastids. comparison of the non-coding region of the two t. cruzi strains showed a duplicated conserved element containing an imperfect 39-bp palindrome located in the variable region, and divergent repetitive motifs of similar nucleotide composition in the repetitive region. several variants of the cl brener and esmeraldo non-coding region were assembled, indicating that maxicircle sequence and size are heterogeneous in these strains. the size of the total assemblies differed between cl brener and esmeraldo strains due to differences in the repetitive area of the non-coding region; a strain-specific 236-nt deletion was found in the esmeraldo coding region. these genomes represent two of the three t. cruzi maxicircle clades defined previously  <cit> .

the profound influence of rna editing on maxicircle genes overshadows all other processes affecting mitochondrial genomes. the main evolutionary forces shaping the nucleotide composition and skew of metazoan mitochondrial genomes are postulated to be the asymmetric processes of dna replication and rna transcription, biasing nucleotide frequency due to differential mutation and selection pressures  <cit> . while these processes may have some effect, rna editing is the dominant influence affecting at and gc skew on both strands of the coding region. unlike metazoans, where all protein-coding genes are encoded on the same strand, maxicircle genes are transcribed as polycistronic transcripts from both strands  <cit> , thus the influence of coding bias and directional mutational bias from transcription would be negated.

generally, protozoan mitochondrial genomes display lower %gc than mitochondrial genomes from metazoans, except for those of insects  <cit> , with the trypanosomatid mitochondria showing among the lowest %gc of all protozoans . the extreme at-richness of trypanosomatid mitochondrial genomes is due to the repetitive portion of the non-coding region  that accounts for approximately 15–18% of the t. cruzi maxicircle sequence and 17–30% of the entire maxicircle sequence in various t. brucei strains  <cit> . at skew is strong in the non-coding region of the maxicircle, but not in the coding region, while gc skew is inverted. different directional biases affect mutation rates in these two regions, related to gene content issues in the coding region and to potential structural and functional constraints on the non-coding region for kinetoplast organization, replication and division.

the poly  tracts of the repetitive region may induce bending of the dna over long stretches. dna bending was first discovered in minicircles  <cit> , and is found in multiple eukaryotic and prokaryotic dnas, especially in control regions such as promoters  <cit>  and origins of replication  <cit> . in minicircles from many kinetoplastids, t. cruzi being an exception, bends are located adjacent to conserved sequence blocks that are likely binding sites for kinetoplast replication proteins  <cit> . the bent region may serve a topological function for packing of the minicircles into the characteristic disc structure  <cit> . maxicircles in t. equiperdum are concatenated in a network independent of minicircles, linked together at a protease-resistant core  <cit> . the bent nature of the repetitive region may form a solenoid structure that intertwines the maxicircles within this central core.

an intriguing conserved sequence element of ~ <dig> bp is present in equivalent positions of the variable region of the t. cruzi cl brener and esmeraldo strains. a 39-bp imperfect palindrome within this element may serve as a specific recognition sequence for dna binding proteins. palindromes may serve as binding sites for dimeric or multimeric proteins at promoter regions and replication origins. origins of replication have been mapped to the non-coding region of t. brucei and c. fasciculata  <cit> . the t. brucei origin lies in the variable region just upstream of the 12s rrna; two conserved 600-bp tandem repeats were found in the t. brucei maxicircle assembly  <cit> . the t. cruzi and t. brucei elements show no conservation at the sequence level, however the position and tandem arrangements suggest a common function. in mammalian mitochondria transcription initiation and dna replication begin at the same site just upstream of the rrna genes  <cit> . in t. brucei the 12s rrna primary transcript initiates approximately  <dig>  kb upstream of the gene  <cit> , in the same region as the origin of replication. this variable region element may have a dual function as both replication origin and promoter.

experimentally-generated hybrids in t. brucei indicate that inheritance of maxicircle sequences is uniparental, while minicircle inheritance is biparental  <cit> . in vitro crosses of differentially-tagged t. cruzi strains also displayed uniparental maxicircle inheritance  <cit> . sequencing of a  <dig> -kb region of the maxicircle from  <dig> t. cruzi strains covering coii and nd <dig> identified three clades encompassing the six defined dtus  <cit> . esmeraldo falls into clade c , while cl brener represents clade b . the same pattern of three clades was observed in phylogenetic analysis of cyb  <cit> . superimposing the maxicircle clades onto our minimalist reconstruction of t. cruzi hybridization events  <cit>  , clade b likely evolved from a clade a  maxicircle inherited in the common ancestor of dtu iia/iic strains following the prior dtu i/dtu iib hybridization. the clade b maxicircle was then passed on to the dtu iid/iie hybrids from their dtu iic-type ancestor  <cit> . bootstrap values from phylogenetic analysis of both coii-nd <dig> and cyb demonstrate the closer association of clade b with clade a than clade c, supporting the uniparental inheritance of dtu iia/iic hybrids maxicircles from a dtu i-like strain. analysis of a dtu i maxicircle should confirm the original donor of the clade b maxicircle.

the mixing of parental minicircles observed in t. brucei hybrids  <cit>  may be a method of ensuring preservation of the specific templates for rna editing that are carried in the grna genes, countering loss of grnas through random segregation of the minicircles to daughter cells  <cit> . grnas from different strains might bear little resemblance to one-another at the sequence level, but their ability to direct the editing process may be indistinguishable relative to the mrna. the physical mixing of the maxicircles during the fusion process may be inhibited by the structural organization of this relatively large molecule within the minicircle-clogged network. with the identification of multiple specific markers in the maxicircles of different strains, recombination or exchange during cellular fusion events may be detected. the spatial arrangement of the maxicircle within the kdna network is not known, and the maxicircle genomes allow the design of specific probes to determine their organization within the kdna disc.

edited genes consistently show a lower percent identity than non-edited genes among the genera. this difference is minor between cl brener and esmeraldo, but increases in comparisons between the trypanosoma species, and is greater still between the trypanosoma spp. and l. tarentolae . editing thus corrects for genomic variability in the number and distribution of thymidine residues, allowing protein sequence conservation despite highly diverged genomic sequences. the nd <dig>  coiii, and atpase <dig> transcripts are extensively edited in t. brucei and t. cruzi, but only require 5' editing in l. tarentolae  <cit> . nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  cr <dig>  cr <dig>  and rps <dig> are extensively edited in all three species but the pre-edited genes are shorter in t. brucei and t. cruzi than in l. tarentolae. as such trypanosoma spp. maintain a smaller maxicircle coding region, but require more grna information than leishmania. trypanosoma branches early in the evolution of trypanosomatids, before the leishmania clade  <cit> , and in accordance with this evolutionary schema the greater number of extensively-edited genes in the trypanosoma may more closely resemble the ancestral state of the trypanosomatina. the loss of extensive rna editing seen in leishmania would represent a derived state  <cit> .

the pressure to maintain extensive amounts of rna editing might be revealed by the consequences of the process. the size of the primary gene template encoded in the maxicircle is radically minimized, with up to half of a gene's coding information stored in grnas whose function is largely unaffected by transition mutations. insertions and deletions of thymidines in the edited gene coding regions are also tolerated due to their subsequent reshuffling during rna editing. rna editing can compensate for certain dna mutations and allow for production of wild-type functional proteins. rna editing is likely to have evolved in a free-living ancestor of trypanosomatids that migrated between aerobic and anaerobic environments  <cit> . thus protein functionality may be maintained despite mutation over many generations in the absence of selection, while the cells live in an environment that relieves them of the necessity to perform oxidative phosphorylation or other aerobic mitochondrial activities.

the t. cruzi strain-specific indels of esmeraldo and cl brener in gene coding regions not edited in t. brucei may represent mutations that are tolerated in a cultured strain, but prohibitive to completion of the digenic lifecycle, as is seen in the degenerate uc strain of l. tarentolae  <cit> . in short, they could represent laboratory-generated dead-ends. however, these mutations may give insight into evolution of the rna editing process. the strong uridine bias evident in the non-edited genes suggests that all of the genes were at one time subject to extensive rna editing. the persistence of 5'-end editing supports the theory that reverse transcriptase mediated recombination of partially edited intermediates eliminated the need for whole-orf editing in several instances. perhaps residual grnas for non-edited genes are maintained in the heterogeneous minicircle population due to the structure of the minicircles themselves in t. cruzi and t. brucei. while in l. tarentolae a single grna is contained on each minicircle, the trypanosoma minicircles carry two to four genes. if maxicircle genes are under pressure to 'escape' from editing, the single-grna minicircles of leishmania are more easily lost from the population than a grna in the triplet or quartet minicircle arrangements of trypanosoma  <cit> , effectively pushing leishmania toward a more rapid loss of editing information. as such, the trypanosoma spp. may carry an extra load in the form of grnas for genes that no longer require editing, but that could be utilized in the repair of indel mutations in normally unedited gene regions as a post-transcriptional proofreading mechanism. with the further characterization of the minicircle populations and rna editing events of the cl brener and esmeraldo strains, these possibilities can be addressed directly.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete assembly of two t. cruzi maxicircle genomes was performed using data generated by genome sequencing projects for the cl brener and esmeraldo strains. these sequences represent two of the three maxicircle mitochondrial genome clades of t. cruzi. the coding region of both maxicircles shows conservation of gene content and order with other kinetoplastids, with similar editing patterns conserved within the trypanosoma. strain-specific indels may indicate unique editing events or non-functional genes. the non-coding regions share duplicated, conserved elements of approximately  <dig> bp situated upstream of the ribosomal rna genes that may serve as origins of replication and transcription initiation sites. repetitive portions of the non-coding region are distinct for each strain, but display similarly poly-a rich sequences that may induce dna bending and serve a structural function.
