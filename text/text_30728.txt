BACKGROUND
recently, complete genomes of many important model organisms have been assembled using either sanger or next generation sequencing such as solexa , roche  <dig>  solid etc.  <cit> . however, repetitive elements in higher eukaryotic genomes interfere with assembly of sequence information alone into unified chromosome-scale scaffolds  <cit> . this obstacle is usually overcome by construction of physical or meiotic linkage maps to provide long-range contiguity. physical mapping can be accomplished by a variety of methods including restriction analysis of bac libraries, radiation hybrid panels, and direct visualization of marker positions on chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization . the latter approach is quite accurate, but only a few markers can be localized in one run. in meiotic linkage mapping, relationships among polymorphic marker sequences are determined by relative frequency of recombination. however, recombination frequency is highly variable, often decreasing near centromeres and high in hotspots, making it difficult to compare genetic and physical distances. in addition, resolution of linkage analysis depends on the type of markers chosen and their abundance.

the diploid amphibian xenopus tropicalis plays a key role in basic biological research. this model system is particularly valuable for studies of early vertebrate embryonic development  <cit> , functional genomics  <cit> , cell biology  <cit> , and vertebrate genome evolution  <cit> . its  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp genome was sequenced  <cit>  and a genetic map covering its  <dig> chromosomes was constructed  <cit> . two genome assemblies are in wide use, both available on http://www.xenbase.org. the version  <dig>  assembly  is solely sequence-based and consists of  <dig>  scaffolds. a more recent assembly, version  <dig>  , orders reassembled scaffolds using meiotic map and synteny information into a ‘main assembly’ of  <dig> chromosome-scale superscaffolds covering ~75% of the genome, with another ~ <dig> small ‘orphan’ scaffolds not incorporated into the main assembly. while this long-range assembly is extremely useful, regions assembled by inferring shared gene order with more complete amniote assemblies must be considered provisional, as synteny is not always conserved over large phylogenetic distances. likewise, the genetic map only locates v <dig>  scaffolds covering ~62% of the x. tropicalis genome, or about  <dig> of ~ <dig> v <dig>   <cit>  scaffolds larger than  <dig> kb; polymorphic markers were not obtained for the remaining ‘unmapped scaffolds’. the largest gaps in the genetic map include the entire short arm of chromosome  <dig>  and a ~ <dig> cm span inside the distalmost marker on the p arm of chromosome  <dig>  interestingly, the gap on chromosome  <dig> appears to contain the x. tropicalis sex determining locus  <cit> , although an independent marker analysis suggests that there is not a large region of sex-specific sequence  <cit>  which might interfere with meiotic mapping.

to identify sequences within these gaps as well as map and assembly errors, we developed an improved method based on high-throughput sequencing of laser microdissected chromosome arms . recent technical advances have enabled low cost genome sequencing of nearly any species  <cit> . however, direct sequencing of specific chromosomes or chromosomal regions has only been successful in species where individual chromosomes could be separated by flow sorting . microdissection of chromosomes has been attempted, but this approach depends on whole-genome amplification due to practical limits on the amount of starting material  <cit> . in the only published study, sequence resolution was low, probably due to the poor yield and quality of the dna obtained  <cit> .

here we used  <dig> microdissected copies of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  this small amount of material was then subjected to whole genome amplification , and sequencing libraries were constructed by transposase-based simultaneous fragmentation and primer insertion, and then sequenced. for wga, we chose the sigma genomeplex single cell kit since it amplified more markers and yielded the highest quantity of dna relative to other systems  <cit> , and has been successfully used to amplify microdissected human chromosomes for snp genotyping  <cit> . this combination provided excellent read depth for placing previously unmapped scaffolds and genes to the 7p region, as well as recognizing mislocalized scaffolds.

RESULTS
we prepared metaphase chromosomes from primary cell cultures of dissected subadult frog testes  <cit> . we then laser microdissected  <dig> copies of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  which is easily distinguishable due to a secondary constriction in its q arm . to ensure harvest of the entire p arm, the laser path was targeted between the constriction and centromere . the extremely small amount of starting material was then amplified by wga, with a total yield of ~ <dig> μg averaging 500– <dig> bp in size. for library construction, we wished to minimize resequencing wga primers added to ends of genomic fragments. to that end, we used a transposase-based simultaneous fragmentation/adaptor ligation method  where sequencing primer insertions are biased away from dna ends.  <dig> bp reads were then obtained in a single lane of illumina gaii. reads were mapped to both versions of xenopus tropicalis assemblies  using bowtie.

comparison to v <dig>  assembly
in total, we obtained  <dig> million  <dig> bp reads, 18% of which mapped with a maximum of 2/ <dig> mismatches to at least one location in the v <dig>  genome assembly. of these,  <dig> , <dig>  mapped to unique sites in the genome . despite our efforts to minimize resequencing wga primers, 30% of non-mapping reads contained at least  <dig> bases of either illumina primer or the proprietary sigma wga sequence. the remaining non-mapping reads could be either contaminated by shorter stretches of primer or reflected misassembled or missing regions of the genome. of the uniquely-mapped reads, nearly 70% mapped to scaffolds previously localized to the p arm of chromosome  <dig> by the genetic map  <cit> , with the majority of those scaffolds showing high read/kb values . since the published genetic map contains large gaps on chromosome  <dig>  chromosome  <dig> and elsewhere, we also collated available cytogenetic map data from fluorescence in situ hybridization with tyramide signal amplification  analysis using cdna probes  <cit> , and evaluated read density on scaffolds anchored by known physical location of probes. read density was congruent with the locations of all  <dig> physically-mapped scaffolds, including  <dig> markers in the 7p region . near the centromere , this ratio drops from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> uniquely-mapped reads/kb, probably due to increased repeat density diluting unique sequence in centromeric scaffolds. we conservatively used the hit ratio of  <dig> unique reads/kb observed for scaffold_ <dig>  localized by fish to just under the centromere  <cit> , as the actual border giving the lowest acceptable hit/kb threshold. all scaffolds with lower than  <dig> hits/kb were considered false positives . the area between  <dig> and  <dig> cm contains scaffolds with around  <dig> read/kb indicating the laser cutting path. below this borderline the hit/kb ratio rapidly falls more than 100×.

threshold is set to <dig> hit/kb .

 <dig> % of unique hits  were found in three scaffolds localized by the meiotic linkage map to non-7p regions. two of these scaffolds were placed on the q arm of chromosome  <dig> in the linkage map despite relatively high read/kb values in our analysis ,  <dig> hits/kb and scaffold_ <dig>   <dig> cm,  <dig> hits/kb). the third scaffold  mapped to the q arm of chromosome  <dig> . since the high hit/kb ratios of these scaffolds are similar to those previously mapped to 7p region by fish-tsa   <cit> , we hypothesize that these sequences should be reassigned to the laser microdissected 7p arm. in total, we identified  <dig> v <dig>  scaffolds not represented on the genetic map  with a read/kb value higher than  <dig>  which we can assign to the 7p region.  <dig> of these unmapped scaffolds are larger than  <dig> kb. on the other hand,  <dig> scaffolds with markers on 7p in the genetic map bore lower read/kb values than the threshold defined above, more consistent with a non-chromosome 7p location.

identification of hybrid scaffolds
to identify misassembled  scaffolds, uniquely mapped reads were visualized on the x. tropicalis  <dig>  assembly . if a whole scaffold were present in the microdissected chromosome part, its full length should be covered by reads. hybrid scaffolds may show gaps without any chromosome-specific hits, consistent with these sequences deriving from other chromosomal regions. we found that approximately 15% of scaffolds with meiotic map markers on 7p contained gaps in read coverage larger than  <dig> kb. these gaps in unique read hits are not generally caused by increased repeat density, which is similar in hit-rich and hit-absent areas , and the gaps usually contain genes, also suggesting that they are not due to repetitive sequence. fish-tsa analysis of three suspected hybrid scaffolds  confirmed assembly discrepancies, with probes from ‘hit rich’ regions localized to 7p, but cdna probes from ‘hit absent’ areas decorating chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . meiotic map markers from these scaffolds are also present in 7p and non-7p regions, confirming that these are hybrid ‘broken’ scaffolds rather than mapping errors. our analysis thus helps pinpoint bad sequence joins in the scaffold assembly.

comparison to v <dig>  assembly
the v <dig>  assembly incorporates both sequence information, long-range contiguity from the meiotic map, and gene synteny relationships from amniote genomes. ~75% of the coverage has been ordered provisionally into  <dig> large superscaffolds corresponding to the  <dig> x. tropicalis chromosomes. in our analysis,  <dig> , <dig> reads placed uniquely on the v <dig>  assembly .  <dig> % of uniquely-mapping reads localized to scaffold   <dig>  with 91% of these in the 0– <dig> mb area roughly corresponding to the 7p region  with an average hit/kb ratio of  <dig> . we defined this value  as a threshold for hit-positive v <dig>  scaffolds. five large gaps with much lower read density were observed between 0– <dig>  mb,  <dig> – <dig>  mb,  <dig> – <dig>  mb,  <dig> – <dig>  mb and  <dig> – <dig>  mb, consistent with areas that were misassembled in v <dig> . the 60– <dig> mb area is the approximate location of the presumptive laser path, but misassembly in this region is also possible. in the remaining part of scaffold  <dig> corresponding to 7q , we identified four large read-dense regions  which are likely to be located on the other arm of chromosome  <dig>  similar sharply-demarcated candidate 7p areas with high read/kb ratios were found also in chromosome/scaffolds  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . analysis of ‘orphan’ scaffolds not incorporated into the main chromosomal assembly identified another  <dig> orphan scaffolds larger than  <dig> kb showing high hit/kb values comparable to scaffold  <dig>  of these, scaffold  <dig>  is covered by high-density reads only on 30% of its length, consistent with a bad sequence join.

discussion
we present an improved technique for next generation sequencing of laser microdissected chromosome arms. comparing a previous study  <cit>  using  <dig> sequencing of dop-pcr amplified human chromosome arms which yielded similar  <dig> bp average reads, we obtained approximately  <dig> × more reads and  <dig> × more unique hits to genome. the increase in usable reads allowed us to set high stringency conditions for mapping .

as mentioned above, a large portion of the reads that did not map to the genome contained wga primer sequences, despite precautions to minimize sequencing end fragments by the use of the nextera system for building the sequencing library. further optimization of library construction to avoid ends could increase usable read yield considerably.

the yield of mapped reads was comparable to that of a study where wheat flow-sorted chromosome arms were sequenced  <cit> . the flow sorting approach can collect abundant chromosomal dna, but can only distinguish a minority of chromosomes in a given karyotype based on size alone  <cit> . laser microdissection enables visual control and much greater discrimination among similarly-sized chromosomes, for example sorting by p/q arm ratio in metaphase spreads or using banding techniques. we verified our analysis using available fish data for  <dig> relevant v <dig>  scaffolds  <cit> . all known 7p scaffolds have a high unique read/kb ratio, whereas non-7p scaffolds show a maximum of  <dig> hit/kb without exceptions . the total fraction of above-threshold reads mapping to chromosome 7p was  <dig> % in the v <dig>  assembly and 91% in v <dig> , comparable to an analysis of human chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  where 93% of reads mapped to the cognate region.

as mentioned above, the chromosome  <dig> linkage map contains a large gap between the most distal marker  and the next one at  <dig> cm. we identified  <dig> scaffolds from the v <dig>  assembly in 7p, only  <dig> of which are represented in the current linkage map. the remaining  <dig> scaffolds, with a total of size  <dig> mb, had either unknown or incorrect positions. many of these newly localized scaffolds are likely to be contained in the distal gap as well as smaller gaps elsewhere on the 7p linkage map.

although v <dig>  7p scaffolds show unique read/kb ratios ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  these values are sufficient to assign scaffolds to the laser microdissected area. identification of scaffolds as hybrid or misassembled by virtue of unequal hit coverage was verified by fish-tsa. scaffolds close to the laser cut have a lower coverage , but these hits are evenly distributed across the scaffold. misassembled scaffolds in the central part of 7p  show sharply uneven distribution of reads, with some areas showing values of ~30– <dig> hit/kb and others < <dig> hit/kb.

in our analysis of the v <dig>  assembly, 91% of uniquely-mapping reads were to above-threshold  scaffolds, a lower percentage than when compared with the v <dig>  assembly and map . our analysis suggests that this is largely due to hits in a few defined regions that were misassembled in v <dig>  chromosome-scale superscaffolds  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  leading to overall below-threshold values for those entire chromosomes/scaffolds. our analysis also identifies  <dig> above-threshold orphan scaffolds, contributing an additional  <dig>  mb of sequence to the 7p region.

threshold set to  <dig> hit/kb .

analysis of sequence from microdissected chromosome arms identified errors in both available x. tropicalis assemblies, with at least 15% of v <dig>  scaffolds mapped to 7p scaffolds misassembled. in the v <dig>  assembly, we located large regions of 7p sequence which were misassigned to superscaffolds  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . interestingly, v <dig>  scaffolds_ <dig>  _ <dig>  and _ <dig>  identified as hybrids by our analysis, were divided in the v <dig>  assembly. however, fish analysis using probes corresponding to the atp13a <dig> and lacc <dig> genes from hit-absent regions of v <dig>  scaffolds_ <dig> and _ <dig> revealed actual locations on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, rather than the positions given by the v <dig>  assembly on chromosomes/superscaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  these results suggest that the v <dig>  assembly has successfully identified bad sequence joins, but has not necessarily correctly repaired them in all cases. high throughput sequencing of microdissected chromosomes or chromosomal arms helps to identify such misassembled domains, as well as to assign orphan scaffolds to chromosomal regions. microdissection and sequencing of particularly problematic areas, such as 7p and 2p, allows sequence domains to be assigned to a specific chromosome arm before extrapolating position from meiotic map or synteny data. improving assembly of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> is critical for characterizing the sex-determination genes of xenopus tropicalis, which is known to use a different system from the dm-w mechanism found in x. laevis <cit> .

since our method could be combined with chromosome banding, it is likely to be particularly useful for de novo assembly of challenging genome projects, such as that of the allotetraploid laboratory model xenopus laevis . in the absence of meiotic or physical map information, correct regional assembly and long-range contiguity would be enhanced by dissecting and sequencing specific chromosomes, all of which in x. laevis can be unambiguously distinguished by banding pattern  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated feasibility of high-throughput sequencing from as little as  <dig> microdissected chromosome arms. this approach will be helpful for validating and completing problematic regions in the x. tropicalis genome, and can also be used in other species without sequenced genomes for describing gene content in selected chromosomes or providing long-range contiguity. moreover, the technique is applicable to molecular analysis of isolated chromosomes from small numbers of cells, which is important for investigation of haplotypes or molecular rearrangements in clinical cytogenetics or oncology.
