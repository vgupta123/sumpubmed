BACKGROUND
a complete genome sequence facilitates the identification of all the genes in an organism and helps determine the set of functions encoded by those genes as well as the regulation of their expression. the identification of protein-coding genes can be approached both experimentally and computationally and the combination of approaches leads to the most complete catalog of genes  <cit> . expressed sequence tags  provide experimental evidence for the transcription of specific regions of the genome and significant similarity with known proteins in other organisms also provides evidence for the existence of a gene. however, both approaches have limitations that often preclude them from identifying the complete gene set. the exclusive use of the former would require a very large library of ests, obtained from a wide variety of environmental and developmental conditions, to ensure that all transcribed regions have been included. identification based on homology will fail to identify genes that are novel to a particular species, or that are sufficiently diverged to make detection unreliable. ab initio gene-finders provide a complementary gene identification method by predicting gene models based on the statistical characteristics of a representative set of protein-coding genes from the genome of interest.

research using the unicellular green alga, chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has provided important insights into many cellular processes that include flagellar assembly and motility, basal body assembly and positioning, phototaxis, gametogenesis and fertilization, circadian rhythms, photosynthesis, starch metabolism, and cell wall assembly  <cit> . chlamydomonas is amenable to genetic analysis using classical techniques of tetrad analysis and complementation as well as molecular techniques of transformation and rna interference  <cit> .

the current catalog of genes for chlamydomonas reinhardtii is based on a combination of experimental and computational approaches  <cit>  where 44% of the  <dig>  models in the catalog are derived from ab initio methods and the remainder use various evidence including similarity in other organisms and manual annotation. the inclusion of multiple ab initio gene-finders gives rise to complementary predictions by providing alternative models that can be used for experimental validation and may lead to the determination of true gene structures. taken together, multiple methods may yield multiple correct predictions for genes with multiple alternate splice variants and a complementing gene-finder can also provide complete models for genes that are incomplete within an existing catalog and predict novel genes.

ab initio gene-finders employ models that capture the essential features of gene structure that include sequence characteristics that distinguish exons and introns that include codon bias and feature length distributions as well as signal sequences that correspond to the splice sites that separate them  <cit> . generalized hidden markov models  are commonly used because gene structure can be represented in a probabilistic framework. given a particular model of gene structure, the quality of predictions depends on the specific values assigned to the model parameters. because these model parameters, such as codon bias and splice site patterns, vary between species, training a gene-finder on a representative set of example genes from the target species is closely related to the accuracy of the resulting predictions. the original greengenie  <cit>  is a version of the genie gene-finder  <cit>  that was optimized for the prediction of genes in chlamydomonas. the parameters for greengenie were obtained by training on only  <dig> genes with experimentally determined structure. greengenie provided more accurate predictions than other programs available at the time; it predicted  <dig> genes within  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb regions of chlamydomonas genomic sequence and we extrapolated that number to predict between  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes in the chlamydomonas genome. this prediction was recently corroborated  <cit> . greengenie facilitated gene identification in chlamydomonas by many groups  <cit> .

to improve the quality of gene prediction in chlamydomonas, we used the est assembly tool, program to assemble spliced alignments   <cit> , to assemble  <dig>  chlamydomonas est sequences into protein coding gene models and trained the most recent version of the genie ab initio gene-finder  <cit>  on this larger set of chlamydomonas gene models. the pasa pipeline begins by filtering and aligning input est sequences onto a genome assembly. these ests alignments are then filtered further and clustered based on alignment compatibility. finally, through a dynamic programming process, the est alignment clusters are stitched into a set of consistent, non-overlapping est assemblies  <cit> . pasa has been used for gene prediction in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , drosophila melanogaster and homo sapiens  <cit> . this larger training set improves the predictions made by the program, now called greengenie <dig>  as determined on a set of  <dig> well-characterized chlamydomonas genes that were not included in the training set and outperforms the most current published gene-finder trained for chlamydomonas. importantly, greengenie <dig> complements the existing chlamydomonas gene catalog  <cit>  by completing incomplete models and predicting new genes that were not previously identified.

RESULTS
constructing and evaluating a training-set of gene predictions from ests
pasa aligned  <dig>  high-quality chlamydomonas est sequences onto the published genome assembly of chlamydomonas, which is called v <dig>  and assembled those alignments into  <dig>  unique models. the set of pasa assembled models to be used for training were selected based on three criteria. first, the model must be complete; it must begin with an atg codon and terminate with a stop codon . second, the assembly must have a minimum open reading frame length of  <dig> bp. third, the pasa model must lack similarity to the gb <dig> reference set of genbank chlamydomonas gene records  and known transposable elements . these criteria reduce the  <dig>  models to  <dig>  models.

a similarity search of the  <dig>  est assembled models against the ncbi non-redundant database  using ncbi blast  was performed to assess the novelty of the assembled ests.  <dig>  of the selected pasa assembled models align to an entry in nrdb  and  <dig>  of the remaining predictions have some overlap  to models in the frozen gene catalog  <cit> , which we will refer to as fgc <dig> . the remaining  <dig>  complete pasa gene models in v <dig> are novel predictions identified by pasa est assembly alone. we find that  <dig> of these novel models contain only a single exon. the quality of this large set of single-exon genes was evaluated by testing  <dig> randomly selected single exon models via rt-pcr. all  <dig> models yield product of the correct size with genomic dna as the template and  <dig> of the  <dig> produce a fragment of the predicted size with cdna as the template by rt-pcr . given that the final set of  <dig>  pasa assembled models are derived directly from  <dig>  chlamydomonas est records and screened to have a complete compliment of gene features, this set of models is likely to provide an improved training set to optimize the parameters of the greengenie <dig> gene-finding program.

greengenie <dig> is more accurate than genemark.hmm-es  <dig> 
one primary purpose of gene-finders is to assist the user by accurately identifying genes in an isolated dna segment that may be up to several kilobases in length. to evaluate the performance of greengenie <dig> on such short-sequence prediction queries we compared the performance statistics of greengenie <dig> and genemark.hmm-es  <dig> , the most recent, publicly available gene-finder trained specifically for chlamydomonas  <cit> .

short-sequence prediction sensitivity and specificity of greengenie <dig> and genemark.hmm-es  <dig>  were computed for the total predictions made by each gene-finder using  <dig> genomic sequences obtained from the literature, referred to as gb <dig> . at the whole-gene level, greengenie <dig> performs considerably better than genemark.hmm-es  <dig> . greengenie <dig> achieves sensitivity and specificity values of  <dig>   and  <dig>   while genemark.hmm-es  <dig>  sensitivity and specificity values are  <dig>   and  <dig>   . a two-proportion z-test indicates that both differences are statistically significant . at the exon level, greengenie <dig> outperforms genemark.hmm-es  <dig>  with sensitivity and specificity values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  as compared to the corresponding values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  when using genemark.hmm-es  <dig>  . the improvements in predictive accuracy made by greengenie <dig> are most obvious with initial and terminal exons . at the nucleotide level, the least stringent assessment of prediction performance, greengenie <dig> shows an improvement of 2â€“3% over the genemark.hmm-es  <dig>  predictions . these results indicate that greengenie <dig> is an improved ab initio gene-finder for chlamydomonas and encouraged us to make whole-genome predictions on assembly v <dig> and compare them to the fgc <dig> catalog  <cit>  with the goal of identifying new genes and improving the accuracy of the current gene models.

greengenie <dig> models in v <dig> complement the frozen gene catalog
greengenie <dig> predictions on chlamydomonas genome assembly v <dig> were screened for a minimum coding length of  <dig> bp and against significant alignment to known transposable elements . the final greengenie <dig> v <dig> catalog, gg2v <dig>  consists of  <dig>  predictions. the identical criteria applied to the fgc <dig> catalog leaves  <dig>  predictions. all models were further classified as complete or incomplete based on the presence of start and stop codons . all gg2v <dig> models are complete by construction. of the  <dig>  models in fgc <dig>  only  <dig> % are complete; the remaining  <dig>  models lack a start codon, a stop codon or both.

given the possible bias towards single-exon models in the greengenie <dig> training set, a comparison of single-exon models between gg2v <dig> and fgc <dig> was performed. in fgc <dig>   <dig> % of complete models are single-exon genes and a similar proportion is observed in gg2v <dig> where  <dig> % of the models are single-exon predictions. a two-proportion z-test  indicates that there is no significant difference between the two proportions of single exon genes and that there is no bias towards the prediction of single-exon genes made by greengenie <dig> 

the gg2v <dig> gene catalog was compared to both the complete and incomplete partitions of fgc <dig>  using interval overlap analysis. this analysis compares two lists of coding sequence coordinates that index a common underlying genome sequence and categorizes each prediction as consistent or conflicting . our analysis finds that 11% of the fgc <dig> models are predicted identically in gg2v <dig> and another 67% partially overlap with gg2v <dig> models . the remaining 22% of fgc <dig> models have no overlap with gg2v <dig> models. additionally, there are  <dig>   gg2v <dig> models without interval overlaps to any model in fgc <dig> 

complete model: any model that includes a starting atg gene feature and terminates with a stop codon .

incomplete model: any model that lacks a start or stop codon or both.

other: models that interlaced overlaps and concatenated exact overlaps.

predictions in gg2v <dig> that have partial interval overlaps to fgc <dig> models can be categorized into models with partially overlapping exons and models containing novel exons. because genie does not allow non-canonical splice sites, we determined the proportion of fgc <dig> exons that partially overlap gg2v <dig> exons with either canonical or non-canonical splice sites. not all splice sites in chlamydomonas follow the canonical rules  <cit> . however, allowing non-canonical splice sites might improve the sensitivity slightly, the marginal gain would come with the cost of many additional false positives.

15% of the partially overlapping fgc <dig> exons contain a non-canonical splice 5' site  and 7% contain a non-canonical 3' splice site . therefore, about 20% of the non-identical, but overlapping exons between the gg2v <dig> and fgc <dig> catalogs are attributable to the fact that the greengenie <dig> model does not allow non-canonical splice sites. the set of partially overlapping models are of particular interest because they may include examples of alternative splicing as well as highlight incorrect models in each catalog. each partially overlapping gg2v <dig> gene model with three or more exons  was compared to the corresponding fgc <dig> model at the exon level. these exons were classified as initial, internal or terminal. the number of novel gg2v <dig> exons and partially overlapping exons was determined . the four largest groups have 1) partial overlaps for all three exon types  and no new exons in the gg2v <dig> model, 2) an alternative initial exon , 3) partially overlapping internal exons and both a novel initial and novel terminal exon  and 4) an alternative terminal exon . overall, 28% of these models have new exon splice sites and no new exons in the gg2v <dig> model. only 4% of the partially overlapping gg2v <dig> models have only novel exons . a small number of each of the partially overlapping models was tested using rt-pcr . figure 1b shows one type of model that has at least one exactly overlapping exon and at least one alternative exon terminus. no experimental support for any of the five fgc <dig> models tested was found, but support for four of the five corresponding gg2v <dig> models tested was found . figure 1c illustrates the second type that has at least one exactly overlapping exon and at least one additional exon in the gg2v <dig> prediction that is absent from the fgc <dig> model. we find support for seven of the eight predictions tested .

predictions in one catalog that have no overlapping counterpart in the other catalog  make up a significant proportion of both gg2v <dig> and fgc <dig> and may represent substantive sets of true genes that reflect the complementarity of the two catalogs. our analysis finds that 22%  of complete fgc <dig> models lack any overlap to models in gg2v <dig> and that 23%  of gg2v <dig> models do not have interval overlap with any complete or incomplete model in fgc <dig>  a small sample of predictions that are exclusive to each catalog was tested by rt-pcr. four of the five gg2v <dig> predictions tested were supported by rt-pcr results . similarly, three of the five novel fgc <dig> predictions were supported by rt-pcr . in silico analysis indicates that a majority of predictions exclusive to each catalog have est or cross-species sequence similarity support or both. wu-blastp sequence similarity analysis indicates that  <dig> % of gene models exclusive to gg2v <dig> align to some protein in the eukaryotic clusters of orthologous genes database   <cit>  or to some sequence in the chlamydomonas est database. similarly, wu-blastp similarity analysis indicates that  <dig> % of the fgc <dig> exclusive models are supported by evidence in the kog or chlamydomonas est databases.

greengenie <dig> is a robust, effective gene-finder across different genome assemblies
our results in the previous section indicate that greengenie <dig> whole-genome predictions complement fgc <dig>  <cit>  and suggest the potential value of including greengenie <dig> models in the annotation of future chlamydomonas assemblies, so we used greengenie <dig> to predict a whole-genome catalog from the latest assembly of the chlamydomonas genome, denoted as gg2v <dig>  sequence analysis of the two chlamydomonas genome assemblies reveals that v <dig> contigs are seven times longer than v <dig> contigs on average, which highlights improved continuity in the v <dig> assembly compared to v <dig> assembly. greengenie <dig> predicts  <dig>  models in the v <dig> assembly that satisfy the quality control constraints discussed previously. we mapped the gg2v <dig> models onto v <dig> scaffolds using blat  <cit>  to facilitate the interval overlap analysis of the gg2v <dig> catalog with gg2v <dig>  only  <dig> of the gg2v <dig> models do not have matches in the v <dig> genome assembly. conversely,  <dig>  of the gg2v <dig> models do not have matches on the v <dig> assembly, which indicates a loss of some sequences in v <dig> compared to v <dig>   <dig> % of the gg2v <dig> models  map completely to a unique locus in v <dig> and likely represent loci that are shared between the v <dig> and v <dig> genome assemblies. 77% of these models are identical to models in gg2v <dig> despite the large changes in the genome contigs that are used for prediction. 21% of them have partial overlaps and only 1% is novel in the gg2v <dig> model set. of the  <dig> % of the gg2v <dig> models that do not map entirely to a single v <dig> locus, most of them  have matches to two or more v <dig> loci, and the remainder contains additional sequences that do not occur on any v <dig> locus. the results indicate that the gg2v <dig> predictions from the updated v <dig> assembly are typically the same as the predictions on the shorter genome contigs of v <dig>  which suggests that the predictions are not overly sensitive to the length of the contigs used as input. furthermore, models that either were previously split across multiple contigs or were missing from the v <dig> assembly explain most of the differences. in both cases it appears that the updated v <dig> assembly has led to improved accuracy of the predicted gene catalog.

discussion
determining genomic and est sequence allows for the identification of the protein coding genes of a particular organism. we have used the information obtained from est sequences to train the ab initio gene-finder genie  <cit>  on a filtered group of pasa assembled models that have both a start codon and a stop codon  to create an accurate ab initio gene-finder for the gc-rich genome of the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

the program to assemble spliced alignments   <cit>  was used to assemble chlamydomonas est sequences that were pre-aligned to the v <dig> chlamydomonas genome assembly. this training set of  <dig>  pasa assembled gene models has extensive biological evidence. interval overlap analysis and homology search indicate that a majority of the pasa predictions align either to an existing chlamydomonas gene model  or have homologs in other organisms . 39% of the pasa models are novel. support for  <dig> of  <dig> novel predictions tested with rt-pcr suggests the potential for using the assembly of pre-aligned est data as a primary basis of gene modeling, rather than as a supplementary source of predictive information.

one primary application of ab initio gene-finders is to accurately predict genes within short genomic sequences. such short-sequence queries are often regions where the user has knowledge of a gene, but depends on the ab initio gene-finder to predict, confirm or correct the exon level structure of the gene. to test the short-sequence prediction accuracy of greengenie <dig>  we compared the predictions of greengenie <dig> to the predictions of the most current, publicly available ab initio gene-finder trained for chlamydomonas, genemark.hmm-es  <dig>   <cit>  on a set of  <dig> chlamydomonas genomic sequences. each of these genomic sequences contains a single known genbank reference chlamydomonas mrna and the corresponding upstream  and downstream  flanking regions. sensitivity and specificity of the two gene-finders was determined by comparing the prediction from each gene-finder against the reference genbank annotation. comparing the predictions on the gene level, greengenie <dig> is significantly more sensitive and specific  than genemark.hmm-es  <dig> . results also indicate that greengenie <dig> outperforms genemark.hmm-es  <dig>  across all four types of exons , in particular, the initial and terminal exons.

another application of ab initio gene-finders is the prediction of whole-genome gene catalogs. greengenie <dig> was used to predict a whole genome gene catalog on chlamydomonas genome assembly v <dig> and this catalog, gg2v <dig>  was compared to the existing fgc <dig> gene models by interval overlap analysis. the two catalogs predict a similar number of genes and a significant number of the models are identical. however, the two catalogs differ in several ways. first, there are a substantial proportion of complete fgc <dig> gene models that overlap but are not identical to gg2v <dig> models . exon level analysis of partially overlapping gg2v <dig> models shows that there are multiple causes . the four most frequent causes include partial exon overlap devoid of any new exons in gg2v <dig>  models that are identical except in the initial exon, models where greengenie <dig> predicts entirely new initial and terminal exons and models that are identical except in the terminal exon. the third class reflects our observation that 32% of fgc <dig> models are incomplete. this analysis illustrates the range of complementarity that exists between the two catalogs. rt-pcr analysis found support for four out of five gg2v <dig> models , but failed to provide support for any of the five fgc <dig> models tested. in addition, seven of eight randomly selected gg2v <dig> models with additional exons that are absent from their fgc <dig> counterparts were validated by rt-pcr . although the number of genes tested is small, the results suggest that greengenie <dig> complements the existing catalog by successfully identifying and correcting gene models that may be incorrect in the current chlamydomonas annotation. second, there is a set of gg2v <dig> predictions  that is absent from fgc <dig>  and a set of fgc <dig> predictions  that is absent from gg2v <dig>  we tested five randomly selected models from each set of exclusive predictions using rt-pcr and found support for four gg2v <dig> models and support for three of the fgc <dig> models tested. furthermore, blastp alignment and est alignment reveal that there is extensive support for almost all predictions that are absent from just gg2v <dig>  or absent from just fgc <dig> . these results indicate that each prediction method complements the other by identifying potentially true genes that are missing from the other catalog. finally, greengenie <dig> completes  <dig>  incomplete fgc <dig> models, which demonstrates another benefit of including greengenie <dig> whole-genome predictions into current and future chlamydomonas gene catalogs.

the average contig length from assembly v <dig> to assembly v <dig> increases seven-fold, which indicates a greater degree of assembly continuity. the robustness of our gene-finder was tested across more continuous genome assemblies by using greengenie <dig> to predict a whole-genome gene catalog with the v <dig> genome assembly. if greengenie <dig> predictions were sensitive to the exact genome assembly used, and in particular if they varied substantially when the length of the genomic contigs changed, it would indicate unreliability in the predictions. however, we find that 77% of the gg2v <dig> models are identical to models in gg2v <dig>  and most of the remainder overlaps significantly with the gg2v <dig> models. a large fraction of the differences are models where the gg2v <dig> predictions extend or merge models in gg2v <dig> based on the longer contiguous sequences in v <dig>  these results are consistent with improvements in the updated assembly of v <dig> and with greengenie <dig> providing reliable predictions on a more contiguous genome assembly.

overall, greengenie performance results on short-sequence and whole-genome predictions suggest that optimizing ab initio gene-finding parameters based on the assembly of a large collection of pre-aligned est sequences as a rapid, low-cost and effective method by which ab initio gene-finders can be established.

CONCLUSIONS
the ab initio gene-finder genie was trained on a large set of complete pasa predicted gene models assembled from available chlamydomonas est sequence data. short-sequence performance analysis indicates that greengenie <dig> is more accurate than the most recent chlamydomonas gene-finder in the literature  <cit> . interval overlap analysis between the greengenie <dig> v <dig> whole-genome catalog and the fgc <dig> catalog reveals that greengenie <dig> complements the current chlamydomonas gene catalog  <cit>  by accurately predicting new v <dig> gene models that are incomplete, incorrect or absent in fgc <dig>  when greengenie <dig> was applied to the latest available chlamydomonas genome assembly and the predicted v <dig> models were mapped back onto v <dig> scaffolds, greengenie <dig> appears to be robust against a seven-fold improvement in assembly continuity. these results illustrate a potential new application of est sequence data to gene prediction and underscore the value of including the predictions of a fast, accurate ab initio gene-finder like greengenie <dig> into present and future catalogs. we have made the greengenie <dig> gene-finder described in this study available online. the submission form is available at .
