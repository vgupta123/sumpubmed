BACKGROUND
the corn kernel serves as a storage organ for assimilation products. its yield directly influences food security. in agricultural production, maize yield is mainly composed of effective ear number, kernel number per ear and kernel weight. kernel weight is the integrated embodiment of three elements: kernel length, kernel width and kernel thickness. thus, understanding the genetic and molecular basis of kernel weight and kernel size is extremely important for the breeding of high-yield maize.

due to the rapid development of molecular biotechnology, comparative genomics, and bioinformatics, many genes associated with maize flowering time, plant architecture and other traits, such as vgt <dig>  <cit> , zmcct  <cit> , spi <dig>  <cit> , zmcla <dig>  <cit> , fea <dig>  <cit>  and tga <dig>  <cit> , have been positionally cloned. however, genes directly related to kernel yield are rarely identified by natural genetic variation. most genes associated with kernel yield are isolated by making use of maize mutants, such as gln1- <dig>  gln1- <dig>  rgf <dig>  sh <dig>  sh <dig>  dek <dig>  and incw <dig> . these genes identified by mutant analysis have facilitated the characterization of kernel development and its regulation. however, the genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms underlying natural quantitative variation in kernel yield have not been completely elucidated.

the genetic basis of quantitative traits can be recognized more clearly through qtl mapping. many qtls related to kernel traits have been identified in the maize genome , but few have been positionally cloned because 1) the maize genome is large and has many transposable elements and repetitive sequences  and 2) most complex traits such as kernel yield and kernel size are controlled by many genes with small effects . qtls identified in different genetic backgrounds across multiple environments have a higher chance of being positionally cloned. a qtl cluster on bin  <dig>  of the maize genome has been repeatedly associated with kernel size and weight in different populations in previous studies. doebley et al.  identified a major qtl for kernel weight in bnl <dig>  - umc42a and umc42a - umc <dig> on bin  <dig>  that explained  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance in two f <dig> populations developed from maize and teosinte, respectively  <cit> . ajnone-marsan p et al.  identified a qtl associated with grain yield on bin  <dig>  using the f <dig> population from a cross of b <dig> and a <dig>  <cit> . peng et al.  identified a qtl conferring kernel size and weight on bin  <dig> – <dig>  of the maize genome using two f2: <dig> populations  <cit> . these results demonstrate the importance of bin  <dig>  for kernel size and weight and provide a target region for fine-mapping and positional cloning.

we previously identified a qtl cluster designated qgw <dig>  that is associated with kernel-related traits on bin  <dig>  in the maize genome in different recombinant inbred line  populations across multiple environments  <cit> . the greatest effect of qgw <dig>  on kernel weight, kernel length and kernel width  was observed in the ril population of lv28 × hzs. these effects imply that this region carries a pleiotropic gene or several closely linked genes that affect both kernel size and weight. in this study, we used the excellent inbred line huangzaosi  which plays an important role in chinese maize breeding and has more than  <dig> inbred progeny lines and  <dig> important hybrids  <cit>  and the ril families from the cross of lv <dig> and hzs to develop a new mapping population. then, we combined linkage analysis and regional association mapping to 1) re-evaluate the genetic effect of qgw <dig>  in the new population; 2) fine-map qgw <dig> ; and 3) infer potential candidate genes responsible for qgw <dig> .

RESULTS
confirmation of qgw <dig> 
hzs and lv <dig> are elite inbred lines in chinese maize breeding. hzs has a higher hundred kernel weight  than lv <dig> , a shorter 10-kernel length  than lv <dig>  and a wider 10-kernel width  than lv <dig>  . to confirm the qtl on bin  <dig> , we developed  <dig> new polymorphic markers  between lv <dig> and hzs on chromosome  <dig> and identified the genotype of all ril families from lv28 × hzs. subsequent re-mapping of qgw <dig>  to the interval bnlg <dig> - umc <dig> on bin  <dig>  explained  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance in hundred kernel weight , 10-kernel length  and 10-kernel width , respectively . using a flanking marker of qgw <dig>  to screen all ril families, we determined that those ril families harbouring the qgw <dig> -hzs allele have greater kernel weight and longer and wider kernels than those harbouring the qgw <dig> -lv <dig> allele . this result is consistent with previous work  <cit>  and indicates that qgw <dig> -hzs plays a positive role in producing a larger kernel.fig.  <dig> phenotypic comparison among huangzaosi, lv <dig> and the ril families that harbour the huangzaosi/lv <dig> allele on qgw <dig> . hzs has a higher 100-kernel weight  than lv <dig> , a shorter 10-kernel length  than lv <dig> , and a wider 10-kernel width  than lv <dig> . the ril families harbouring the qgw <dig> -hzs allele have greater kernel weight and longer and wider kernels than those harbouring the qgw <dig> -lv <dig> allele

subsequently, we crossed the ril family of g <dig>  which harbours the qgw <dig>  allele from lv <dig>  with hzs to produce an ril-f <dig> population. using these  <dig> f <dig> plants in  <dig>  qgw <dig>  was mapped to the umc2061-bnlg <dig> interval . the allele of hzs displays partial dominance over the allele of lv <dig>  the locus qgw <dig>  explained  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance in kernel length, kernel width and kernel weight, respectively . these results confirmed that the umc2061-bnlg <dig> interval contains a functional unit controlling kernel size and weight in maize.

fine-mapping of qgw <dig> 
to improve the accuracy of the fine-mapping, we developed indel  markers to replace the initial simple sequence repeat  markers; the initial ssr markers have a fuzzy physical location around qgw <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  of the maize genome . using the new indel markers to genotype the ril-f <dig> population, qgw <dig>  was further mapped to the nd16-nd <dig> interval by qtl analysis . qgw <dig>  explained  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance in kernel length, kernel width and kernel weight, respectively, according to the results of the re-analysis . this result is consistent with the qtl mapping using the initial ssr markers, indicating that the physical locations of these markers are the same. we then identified five recombinant types using the new markers on the  <dig> f <dig> individuals in  <dig>  among which f2-rec <dig> to f2-rec <dig> carried the lv <dig> allele in the nd16-nd <dig> interval, whereas f2-rec <dig> to f2-rec <dig> carried the hzs allele in the corresponding interval . the 100-kernel weight of f2-rec <dig> to f2-rec <dig> was distinctly less than that of heterozygotes in this region and less than that of f2-rec <dig> to f2-rec <dig> , indicating that the nd16-nd <dig> interval may contain a qtl for kernel weight. similar performance in kernel length and kernel width was observed , suggesting that the nd16-nd <dig> interval might contain a pleiotropic qtl.fig.  <dig> the process of map-based cloning of qgw <dig> . a location of qgw <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  mapped using the f <dig> population in  <dig>  b and c the genotypes and phenotypes of different recombination types selected from the f <dig> population in  <dig> and  <dig>  these recombinants of the two f <dig> populations were both classified into seven types. the genetic structure for each type is depicted as black, white, or grey rectangles, representing homozygous huangzaosi/huangzaosi, homozygous lv28/lv <dig>  and heterozygous huangzaosi/lv <dig>  respectively. the tables on the right show the variations in 100-kernel weight, 10-kernel length and 10-kernel width of each recombinant type between different genotypes, and the total number  of plants refers to all plants of a given recombinant type in the f <dig> populations. **, significantly different at p <  <dig> ; ns no significant difference at the p <  <dig>  level. these findings suggested that the qgw <dig>  allele from huangzaosi can increase the 100-kernel weight, 10-kernel length and 10-kernel width. the interval of qgw <dig>  could be narrowed down from an ~ <dig> -mb to an ~ <dig> -kb region that was flanked by the markers no <dig> and nd4m26

a larger segregating population with  <dig> f <dig> individuals was developed from the f <dig> plants, which are heterozygous in the nd16-nd <dig> interval, and used to fine-map qgw <dig>  in summer  <dig>  furthermore, new markers were developed to identify recombinants in the nd16-nd <dig> interval. using the same analytical method, we successfully narrowed qgw <dig>  to the no4-nd4m <dig> interval in the maize genome, which is  <dig>  kb long . there was no significant difference in kernel weight between lv <dig> and f3-rec <dig> to f3-rec <dig> carrying the lv <dig> allele in the no4-nd4m <dig> interval on the maize genome . in addition, the kernel weight of f3-rec <dig> to f3-rec <dig> carrying the hzs allele in the no4-nd4m <dig> interval was greater than that of lv <dig> . the kernel width of f3-rec <dig> to f3-rec <dig> was greater than that of lv <dig>  and f3-rec <dig> to f3-rec <dig> carrying the lv <dig> allele in the interval were closer to lv <dig> than were f3-rec <dig> and f3-rec <dig> carrying the hzs allele of qgw <dig> . however, the kernel length was the same between f3-rec <dig> to f3-rec <dig> and f3-rec <dig> to f3-rec <dig> . the unexpected kernel size performance can be attributed to the strong environmental influence on kernel-related traits. in conclusion, we confirmed that there is a gene controlling kernel weight that also likely affects kernel length and kernel width in specific environments.

validation of qgw <dig>  in the ril population
we next determined whether the restricted interval  is present in the ril population from the cross of hzs and lv <dig> and has significant genetic effects on phenotypes. kernel weight and kernel size were evaluated in six different environments  <cit> . we used the markers no <dig> and nd4m <dig> to genotype the ril population. among the rils,  <dig> and  <dig> families were homozygous for hzs and lv <dig>  respectively. kernel weight and kernel width differed significantly  between the rils homozygous for hzs and lv <dig> in all six environments , and kernel length differed significantly  in all but the xinjiang  <dig> environment . these findings suggest that the qtl in the interval of no4-nd4m <dig> can affect kernel weight and kernel size in the ril population, which is in agreement with our previous fine-mapping results.fig.  <dig> validation of qgw <dig>  for hundred kernel weight  in the ril population in six different environments. the rils were genotyped by using the markers no <dig> and nd4m <dig>  the distributions and mean values for hkw are shown for the two homozygous genotypes, huangzaosi and lv <dig>  at six experimental sites. compared with the ril families with the lv <dig> homozygous genotype at the qgw <dig>  region, the ril families with the huangzaosi homozygous genotype at the qgw <dig>  region had significantly higher  hundred-kernel weight across the six different environments



regional association mapping
we used the strategy of regional association mapping to further narrow down qgw <dig>  and identify candidate genes. an association mapping panel that contains  <dig> inbreed lines was field evaluated at three locations in  <dig> years. we selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms  markers in an interval  containing the sequence of umc2061-bnlg <dig> on chr <dig> of the maize genome. using the mixed linear model, we identified one snp, syn <dig>  that was associated with the variation in kernel weight and 10-kernel width and explained  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation in kernel weight and kernel width, respectively . however, no marker was identified that was significantly associated with kernel length.fig.  <dig> results of regional association mapping. mlm tests at the region 30–40 mb of chromosome  <dig>  only syn <dig> was significantly associated with 100-kernel weight and 10-kernel width 



prediction of candidate genes
the no4-nd4m <dig> interval on the b <dig> genome is  <dig>  kb long and contains only two genes  and some transposable elements annotated in b <dig> reference genome v <dig>  assembly . previous studies have demonstrated that grmzm2g <dig> is not expressed in developing kernels  <cit> . the snp syn <dig>  which was identified by regional association mapping, is located in the gene grmzm2g <dig>  we therefore considered this gene a candidate gene controlling kernel weight and size. grmzm2g <dig> encodes a putative leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase family protein. sequencing revealed  <dig> snps and one indel in the exons of this gene between hzs and lv <dig>  these variations in the coding region cause eight amino acid substitutions . sift analysis, which assesses whether an amino acid substitution affects the structure of a protein or its function, revealed that one of the eight substitutions was predicted with high confidence to result in the loss of protein function of grmzm2g <dig> . the threonine encoded by the hzs allele is hydrophilic, whereas the isoleucine encoded by the lv <dig> allele is hydrophobic. this amino acid substitution may result in different protein functions that underlie the differences in 100-kernel weight and kernel size between hzs and lv <dig> table  <dig> polymorphic sites causing amino acid changes in the protein of grmzm2g039934

notes: aamino acid substitution format is x#y, where x is the original amino acid, # is the position of the substitution, and y is the new amino acid. ba delta alignment score is computed for each supporting sequence. the scores are then averaged within and across clusters to generate the final provean score. if the provean score is equal to or below a predefined threshold , the protein variant is predicted to have a “deleterious” effect. if the provean score is above the threshold, the variant is predicted to have a “neutral” effect; cfor maximum separation of the deleterious and neutral protein variants, the default score threshold is currently set at − <dig>  for binary classification



association mapping of the candidate gene and haplotype analysis
to determine the sites responsible for the differences in kernel size and kernel weight between hzs and lv <dig>  the allelic variations of  <dig> sequence polymorphisms  identified in hzs and lv <dig> were exclusively analysed in  <dig> inbred maize lines. the alleles in each polymorphic site with minor allele frequency > <dig>  were used for association mapping using the mixed linear model , controlling for population structure  and kinship  . the results revealed that one polymorphism  in the coding region and two polymorphisms  in the intron were associated with kernel length, three polymorphisms  in the coding region were associated with kernel width, and two polymorphisms  in the coding region were associated with kernel weight at the p <  <dig>  level . however, none of these polymorphisms generates an amino acid substitution.fig.  <dig> association between the polymorphisms in grmzm2g <dig> and hkw, 10kl and 10kw. all polymorphic sites with maf ≥ <dig>  were used. the y axis represents the lod score obtained by mlm on the panel of  <dig> inbred lines with variable kernel weights and kernel sizes. six polymorphic sites in the gene grmzm2g <dig> were significantly associated with kernel weight and kernel size



haplotype analysis suggested that s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  which are associated with kernel length, might classify the population into two types. the two haplotypes differed significantly in kernel length at the p <  <dig>  level , but both the hzs and lv <dig> alleles belong to haplotype  <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  which are significantly associated with kernel width, may divide the panel into four haplotypes. the phenotypes of haplotype  <dig>  haplotype  <dig> and haplotype  <dig> did not differ significantly but were significantly wider than haplotype  <dig> . the kernel width for haplotype  <dig>  which corresponds to the hzs genotype, was significantly higher than that of haplotype  <dig>  which corresponds to the lv <dig> genotype, consistent with the kernel width difference between hzs and lv <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  which are related to 100-kernel weight, form three different haplotypes . the phenotype of haplotype  <dig>  which corresponds to the lv <dig> genotype, had a smaller kernel weight than those of haplotypes  <dig>  and haplotype  <dig> which corresponds to the hzs genotype.fig.  <dig> phenotypic comparisons of different haplotypes for different traits. different letters indicate statistically significant differences , according to a pairwise t test. haplotype analysis suggested that s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  which associated with kernel length, might classify the population into two types. the two haplotypes differed significantly in kernel length at the p <  <dig>  level. s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  which significantly associated with kernel width, could divide the panel into four haplotypes. the kernel width for haplotype  <dig>  which corresponded to the hzs genotype, was significantly greater than that of haplotype  <dig>  which corresponded to the lv <dig> genotype. s <dig> and s <dig>  which were related to 100-kernel weight, formed three different haplotypes. the phenotype of haplotype  <dig>  which corresponded to the lv <dig> genotype, had a lower kernel weight than haplotype  <dig>  which corresponded to the hzs genotype



discussion
comparison of qgw <dig>  and other major qtl for kernel weight and size
kernel weight and size, as yield components, are typical quantitative traits that are controlled by multiple genes and sensitive to environmental impacts. the development of molecular markers has led to the identification of  <dig> qtl related to kernel weight and size distributed in the entire genome according to data in the maizegdb . in bin <dig> , multiple qtl associated with yield components have been found: qcobd <dig> for cob diameter  <cit> , qgyld <dig> for grain yield  <cit> , qkrow <dig> for kernel row number  <cit>  and qkw <dig> for kernel weight  <cit> . peng et al.  identified a qtl cluster for kernel weight and kernel length in bin <dig>  with two f2: <dig> populations  <cit> . li et al.  and wang et al.  both identified a metaqtl associated with yield components by meta-analysis in bin <dig>   <cit> . these results implied that qgw <dig>  with these qtl formed a core cluster for qtl controlling different kernel related traits.

prado et al.  have found multiple qtl related to kernel weight, located in bins  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . liu et al.  identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> qtl related to kernel length, kernel width and kernel weight, respectively  <cit> . zhang et al.  found  <dig> main-effect qtl related kernel weight and size  <cit> . only a few of these qtl can be found in different genetic background and different environments. among these qtl, digenic interactions involving multiple loci over the whole genome have been shown to be related to kernel weight and size. like these qtl, qgw <dig>  can explain  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance in hundred-kernel weight, 10-kernel length and 10-kernel width, respectively. compared with the above qtl, qgw <dig>  can be found in many different populations including the f <dig> populations from the cross of maize and teosinte  <cit> , the f <dig> population from a cross of b <dig> and a <dig>  <cit> , the f2: <dig> populations from huangzaosi and qi <dig>  the ril population from huangzaosi and other inbred lines  <cit> . based on the genetic linkage map constructed using  <dig> bins as markers, we don’t found the digenic interaction between qgw <dig>  and other quantitative trait loci . these results suggested that the genetic bases of kernel weight and size are very complex and that positional cloning of these qtl will be very difficult. compared with these qtl, qgw <dig>  may allow more efficient positional cloning of the candidate gene.

qgw <dig>  is an important and pleiotropic locus
high-throughput snp genotyping analysis of elite maize germplasm in china identified bin  <dig>  as one of the conserved regions transmitted from huangzaosi, an important foundation parent, to its descendants  <cit> . the locus qgw <dig>  is present across multiple environments and different genetic backgrounds such as huangyesi <dig>  lv <dig>  qi <dig>  huobai and duo <dig>  among the different populations, qgw <dig>  is related to multiple kernel traits. in the above populations, qgw <dig> -hzs is positive for kernel-related traits, whereas other parents are negative for these traits. these results suggest that qgw <dig>  is very important for hzs and hzs-derived lines and is a positive qtl for kernel-related traits.

many previous studies have indicated that yield and kernel-related traits are controlled by a set of qtls, some of which are qtl clusters . the distribution of these qtl clusters can be explained by a pleiotropic qtl or multiple tightly linked qtls. when a high-resolution map has been constructed, a qtl cluster can be resolved into many minor effect qtls. qtl analysis in maize has clearly demonstrated that many complex traits controlled by qtl clusters, such as the grain yield, kernel size and other agronomic traits, can be broken down into many qtls once the linkage map has been improved  <cit> . however, a qtl cluster may contain only one major qtl that controls multiple related traits and thus has pleiotropic effects. in the present study, qtl mapping in the ril families restricted qgw <dig>  to a 10-mb interval and revealed its relationship to both kernel size and kernel weight. when the interval was further narrowed to 1 mb, qgw <dig>  remained associated with the three traits. this finding suggests that qgw <dig>  may be a pleiotropic locus that affects kernel size and kernel weight in maize.

grmzm2g <dig> is involved in the development of maize kernels via a different mechanism than in rice
in this study, we successfully fine-mapped qgw <dig>  to a  <dig>  kb interval. previous studies have indicated that only grmzm2g <dig> is expressed in this interval in kernels of maize  <cit> . regional association mapping revealed that the snp syn <dig>  which is located in grmzm2g <dig>  is significantly associated with 100-kernel weight and 10-kernel width. we therefore propose that grmzm2g <dig> is a candidate gene related to the development of maize kernels. in rice, a 1-bp deletion in gw <dig> results in a premature stop codon. the loss of function of gw <dig> leads to an increased cell number, a wider spikelet hull and an accelerated grain milk-filling rate, which increases grain width, weight and yield  <cit> . like gw <dig>  a single snp in exon <dig> of gs <dig> results in a premature stop codon. the shorter protein is associated with a longer grain length and larger grain weight  <cit> . a 1212-bp deletion in gw <dig> is associated with increased grain width in rice  <cit> . however, we did not identify any deletion or snp changes resulting in a premature stop codon in grmzm2g <dig> in maize. thus, the mechanisms underlying kernel development and regulation may differ between maize and rice.

grmzm2g <dig> encodes a putative leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase family protein. the protein product of the candidate gene is in the same family as dwarf <dig>  which is involved in the brassinosteroid  biosynthesis network and influences grain size development in rice  <cit> . studies in arabidopsis and rice have demonstrated that brassinosteroids play an important role in seed development . many br-deficient mutants of arabidopsis  and rice  have a common phenotype that includes dwarfism, short organs, and small grains. moreover, overexpression of br biosynthesis-related genes increases grain size and the number of grains. these results suggest that brs play a key role in normal seed development. however, the detailed mechanisms of br regulation of seed development remain unclear. the rice dwarf mutant d <dig> has a phenotype of smaller grains and lower kernel weight compared to wild type due to loss of function of the rice brassinosteroid insensitive <dig> orthologue osbri <dig>  <cit> . the mutants have higher biomass than wild type under high planting density. moreover, the partial suppression of osbri <dig> can increase grain yield by regulating the brassinosteroid biosynthesis network in transgenic rice plants. grmzm2g <dig> may be involved in the same biosynthetic process in maize. detailed studies are necessary to reveal the mechanisms by which grmzm2g <dig> regulates kernel development in maize.

qgw <dig>  for maize breeding
maize is the most widely grown crop in the world, and to improve the grain yield has always been a top priority  <cit> . identifying useful qtls related to grain yield such as kernel weight, kernel size and kernel number is important for genetic manipulation to increase production via maize breeding. there are many successful examples of the introduction of useful qtls. for example, the introduction of qhsr <dig>  which is a qtl related to head smut in head smut–susceptible lines via marker-assisted selection, has significantly reduce disease incidence over time in maize  <cit> . qgw <dig>  has been identified in different populations and in different environments  <cit> . in this study, the presence of qgw <dig>  was confirmed using two f <dig> populations of various sizes and regional association mapping analysis in a panel of  <dig> inbreed lines. therefore, qgw <dig>  may be utilized in maize breeding by marker-assisted selection. the lv <dig> allele at qgw <dig>  decreases 100-kernel weight and kernel size relative to the hzs allele; thus, it may be feasible to use lines carrying the hzs allele to improve lines carrying the lv <dig> allele in qgw <dig> . in particular, the two snp sites s <dig> and s <dig>  which are associated with kernel weight and kernel width, could help breeders to select wider and heavier kernels of maize in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
we combined linkage analysis and association mapping to fine-map and identify candidate gene at qgw <dig> , a major quantitative trait locus  associated with maize kernel weight and size. qtl qgw <dig>  was fine-mapped to a  <dig> -kb interval in a segregating population derived from a cross of huangzaosi with lv <dig>  we identified grmzm2g <dig> as the candidate gene responsible for qgw <dig> . furthermore, six polymorphic sites in the gene grmzm2g <dig> were significantly associated with kernel weight and size. these results will improve our understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms underlying kernel development in maize, which are important components of grain yield.
