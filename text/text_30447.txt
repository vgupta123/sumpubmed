BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae  is among the most common multi-resistant bacteria causing healthcare associated infections . extended-spectrum β-lactamase  producing k. pneumoniae are associated with both hospital and community infections  <cit> . worldwide, there is an increasing number of reports on ctx-m producing k. pneumonia isolates, as evidenced from data presented in different multi-centre studies. k. pneumoniae isolates with plasmids harbouring ctx-m- <dig> have been reported from clinical isolates both from europe and america . the mobility of genetic elements, in particular those conferring antibiotic resistance traits, together with clonal expansion contributes to the persistence of these strains in hospitals and in the community  <cit> . there are currently only a few reports of chromosomally encoded ctx-m alleles in escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, salmonella enterica and proteus mirabilis . recently, k. pneumoniae strains with chromosomally integrated ctx-m- <dig> at an undetermined locus were typed as st <dig> in a spanish study  <cit> .

here we report the clonal outbreak of esbl producing k. pneumoniae carrying blactx-m- <dig> in a distinct chromosomal location.

methods
bacterial isolates
twenty-three non-repetitive, phenotypically proven esbl producing- k. pneumoniae clinical isolates collected consecutively were studied. they represent  <dig>  % of all k. pneumoniae isolated during the study period. these isolates were taken from miscellaneous specimens including urine, sputum, blood and various swabs over a period of 16 weeks from january  <dig> to may  <dig>  the esbl phenotype was detected using disk diffusion methods  <cit> . in addition to routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion, the minimal inhibitory concentrations  for cefepime and tigecycline were determined using e-test stripes  following the manufacturer’s instruction. isolates with a mic of ≥ 8 mg/l for cefepime and a mic of ≥ 2 mg/l for tigecycline were considered resistant according to recommendations made by the clinical laboratory standards institute  <dig> .

genetic relatedness and genes encoding for β-lactamases
all isolates were screened for the presence of ctx-m, tem and shv genes using primers and methods described previously  <cit> . pcr fragments were sequenced with the abi prism  <dig> sequencer . dna sequence analysis was performed using the dnastar software  and homology searches performed using the ncbi blast database .

pfge was performed according to the pulse net protocol of the centre for disease control and prevention . strain differentiation by pfge analysis was achieved by comparison of band patterns using gelcompar ii . patterns were normalized using the molecular weight marker . the similarity coefficient  of sample pairs was calculated based on band positions by using the dice metric  <cit> . dendograms were generated to visualize relationships among the isolates. the cut-off value in the dendograms was calculated at a sab of  <dig>  as a threshold for defining clusters of genetically similar isolates.

phylogenetic grouping was performed using a rapid method combining gyra pcr- restricted fragment length polymorphisms analysis , parc-pcr and adonitol fermentation as described previously  <cit> . pcr based replicon typing was done as described by carattoli et al.  <cit>  to determine the replicons of plasmid in all clinical isolates. to detect sequence type , mlst was performed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, pcr for seven housekeeping genes  was conducted and the products were directly sequenced and analyzed for single loci variants.

location of the ctx-m- <dig> gene
conjugation was performed using plate mating experiments as described  <cit>  . plasmid analysis was done using the method described  <cit> . the dna was transferred on a polyvinyl-based membrane using overnight capillary transfer  and hybridization done using a ctx-m- <dig> dig labelled probe  following manufacturer’s instructions.

the whole genome sequence of chromosomal dna of isolate number  <dig> was determined. chromosomal dna was isolated from an overnight culture with the purelink dneasy kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . the dna was then sheared to about 290 bp on the bioruptor sonication system . a chromosomal dna library was built on the abi library builder, using the library builder™ fragment core kit for solid®  <dig> according to the protocol demonstrated by life technologies . the library was then sequenced on a  <dig> ion torrent chip using the ion pgm  <dig> sequencing kit . the ion torrent pgm  produced  <dig>  million reads with an average length of 185 bp, which amounted to  <dig>  mbp of bases,  <dig>  mbp of which were q <dig> or higher quality. the reads were assembled using mira  <dig>   <cit> , resulting in  <dig> contigs larger than or equal to 500 bp with an average coverage of  <dig>  ×. the n <dig> contig size was  <dig>  bp. the assembly was improved by manually adding pcr reads in lasergene seqman software environment . a ctx-m- <dig> carrying insertion element was detected on the chromosome. the inverted repeats of th element were found by comparing the sequence to those of partridge  <cit>  and fukui et al. . primers were designed  to study the regions flanking ctx-m- <dig> table  <dig> primers used in this study to investigate ctx-m- <dig> location

*when the insertion is not present at the examined locus, no specific pcr fragments should be able to be generated, except for the last primer pair, which should then give a pcr product of  <dig> base pairs 



ethical approval
the study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of the justus-liebig-university of giessen . all samples were taken as part of standard care procedures.

RESULTS

plasmid analysis and chromosomal location
plasmid analysis revealed that all isolates harboured multiple plasmids of various sizes ranging from less than  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb. despite this fact, the ctx-m- <dig> resistance gene was not transferable from pfge b <dig> sub cluster a <dig> isolates  by conjugation or transformation in multiple attempts made. hybridization using a ctx-m- <dig> dig labelled probe indicated a chromosomal location in five isolates of pfge type b <dig> subclone a <dig>  several colonies selected on a lysogeny broth plate containing 2 mg/l cefotaxime with a positive ctx-m pcr and phenotypically confirmed for esbl production, were investigated for the insertion locus of the ctx-m- <dig> allele. in all cases a complete ctx-m-15/isecp1-element of  <dig>  bp with flanking direct repeats  was found . comparison of the contig sequence obtained by whole-genome sequencing of a representative isolate  of the pfgesub cluster a <dig>  which harbours the ctx-m-15/isecp1-element, with a reference strain sequence  revealed that the element is inserted between the coding sequences  kpk_ <dig>  and kpk_ <dig> , indicating integration of the transposition unit harbouring the isecp <dig> insertion sequence and the ctx-m- <dig> gene into the chromosome of the outbreak strain. the resulting contig sequence was deposited in the genbank nucleotide database under accession number hg <dig> fig.  <dig> schematic diagram showing the chromosomal insertion site and the surrounding environment. a overview and chromosomal context compared to the reference genome of k. pneumoniae  <dig>  accession number cp <dig>  b detailed view of the chromosomal insertion locus of blactx-m- <dig> in klebsiella pneumoniae ur <dig>  and binding sites of primers as seen in the tables  <dig> and 2




the other  <dig> strains within the sub-cluster a <dig>  were all tested positive for the same insertion locus using a specifically developed, sequence-based pcr-assay underlining their clonal identity .

discussion
the study documents the presence of k. pneumoniae clones carrying a chromosomally located ctx-m- <dig> in a large university hospital in germany. the high prevalence of ctx-m- <dig> is consistent with many other studies worldwide  <cit>  but unlike those studies in a subset of isolates, the ctx-m- <dig> gene was not transferable by conjugation or transformation and dna hybridization studies indicated a chromosomal localization for the gene. this was confirmed by whole genome sequencing and pcr mapping studies. descriptions of chromosomal locations of esbl genes in clinical isolates are extremely rare, with only a single report of chromosomally located ctx-m- <dig> at an undetermined location for a k. pneumoniae st <dig> isolate and unlike the outbreak isolates reported here which were typed as st <dig>  <cit> . st <dig> belongs to the clonal complex 11; this clonal complex of k. pneumoniae has been associated with different esbl alleles including ctx-m- <dig>  oxa- <dig> and more recently kpc  <cit> . it is now globally disseminated and is associated with healthcare-associated infections in north america, europe and asia . it is worth noting that in most of the studies describing the epidemiology of blactx-m- <dig>  the location of the gene is not always stated, thus a chromosomal location may be a more common phenomenon than previously suspected.

in the present study the complete isecp1/ctx-m- <dig> transposition unit with inverted repeats was found to be located on the chromosome, resulting in the duplication of a 5 bp repeat sequence . the organization of this transposition unit was similar as in conjugative incf plasmids  <cit>  where the ctx-m- <dig> gene was also found 49 bp downstream of isecp <dig>  as described in reference plasmids the right inverted repeat was located in orf <dig> , downstream of the ctx-m- <dig> gene. this organization has been observed in 98 % of incf plasmids carrying ctx-m- <dig> and also in the chromosome of kluyvera ascorbata carrying ctx-m- <dig>  <cit> . chromosomally encoded β-lactamases from some kluyvera species have been proposed as a possible source of ctx-m enzymes. the finding from this study suggests that other enterobacteriaceae might also act as intermediate hosts and as a possible source of ctx-m genes.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time we describe the site of integration of a complete ctx-m-15/isecp <dig> element into the chromosome of a k. pneumoniae st <dig> strain. this insertion site is distinct and differs markedly from a recently published sequence of a k. pneumoniae st <dig> isolate where ctx-m- <dig> alleles were present both on a plasmid as well as a chromosomal location   <cit> . the site of insertion also differs from that reported for the st <dig> e. coli jj <dig> strain  <cit> . our studies also reveal the presence of several large incf plasmids in k. pneumoniae which have hitherto been poorly characterized, warranting additional studies. using data derived in this study we have devised a specific pcr-based assay to examine for the chromosomal insertion of ctx-m- <dig> in st <dig> k. pneumoniae isolates.
