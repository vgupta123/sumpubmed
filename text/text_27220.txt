BACKGROUND
baculoviruses are a large group of rod-shaped, enveloped viruses with circular, covalently closed, double-stranded dna genomes. these viruses are pathogenic to arthropods, mainly insects within the orders lepidoptera, diptera and hymenoptera  <cit> . according to morphology of the virus occlusion bodies , the family baculoviridae comprises two genera: the nucleopolyhedroviruses  and granuloviruses . the lepidopteron npvs can be further divided into two sub-groups on the basis of their envelope fusion proteins, which are essential for the spread of infection in the insect and are required for efficient virus budding. group i npvs possess proteins related to gp <dig>  whereas no gp <dig> homologues have been identified in group ii npvs  <cit> . instead, members of group ii encode homologues of ld <dig> proteins, also known as fusion  proteins  <cit> . the taxonomy of the baculoviridae genera has recently been changed on the basis of the hosts. there are now four genera: the alphabaculoviruses , betabaculoviruses , gammabaculoviruses , and deltabaculoviruses   <cit> .

in recent years, much research has focused on baculoviruses owing to their potential as agents for biological control of pests in agriculture and forestry  <cit> . furthermore, they can be used as efficient expression vectors of foreign genes  <cit> . forty-eight completely-sequenced baculovirus genomes, including  <dig> alphabaculoviruses,  <dig> betabaculoviruses,  <dig> gammabaculoviruses and  <dig> deltabaculovirus , with sizes ranging from  <dig>  base pairs  in neodiprion lecontei npv   <cit>  to  <dig>  bp in xestia c-nigrum gv   <cit> , have been made available in genbank since the autographa californica npv  genome sequence was reported  <cit> .

clanis bilineata , belonging to lepidoptera sphingidae, is a major agricultural pest causing considerable damage to soybean production in china. no baculovirus able to infect c. bilineata larvae was reported until  <dig>  <cit> , when a novel baculovirus named clanis bilineata nucleopolyhedrovirus  was isolated and purified from the larvae of the sphingid c. bilineata infected with npv. transmission electron micrographs showed that this virus occludes single-enveloped nucleocapsids and hence is an snpv  <cit> . the clbinpv genome comprises  <dig>  bp and codes for  <dig> putative open reading frames  with a minimum size of  <dig> nucleotides. in this report, we present the complete sequence and organization of the clbinpv genome and compare them to other baculoviruses through genomic and phylogenetic analyses.

RESULTS
nucleotide sequence analysis of the clbinpv genome
the genome of clbinpv has a size of  <dig>  bp , slightly smaller than that of spodoptera exigua npv   <cit> . clbinpv has a highly at rich genome. its overall g+c content is 37%, similar to that recorded for agrotis segetum gv  and ecotropis obliqua npv   <cit> , and higher only than those of adoxophyes honmai npv   <cit>  and adoxophyes orana npv  among the alphabaculovirus .

according to convention  <cit> , the adenine residue at the translational atg start codon of the polyhedrin gene  was considered to be nucleotide number  <dig> of the genome, and successive nucleotides were numbered in the direction of the polh gene . analysis of the clbinpv genome sequence led to the identification of  <dig> putative orfs with  <dig> or more amino acids and minimal overlapping of adjacent orfs. there are  <dig> orfs with the same orientation as the polyhedrin gene, and  <dig> with the reverse orientation. within  <dig> bp upstream of the atg start codon,  <dig> clbinpv orfs have baculovirus early promoter motifs ,  <dig> have late promoter motifs , and  <dig> carry both these motifs.

of the  <dig> clbinpv orfs identified,  <dig> are homologous to at least one other baculovirus, and the  <dig> core genes that are probably shared by all baculoviruses are conserved in the clbinpv genome  <cit> . thirteen orfs  are unique to clbinpv; they account for 9% of the whole genome. three baculovirus-repeated orfs  were identified in clbinpv  and were designated bro-a, bro-b and bro-c, respectively, based on their order in the genome. no typical homologous regions  were detected in clbinpv, which is similar to chrysodeixis chalcites npv . the relative locations of these orfs are shown diagrammatically in linear format in figure  <dig>  their orientations, sizes and other details are shown in additional file  <dig> 

phylogenetic analyses and gene content
the sequences of individual baculovirus genes such as polyhedrin/granulin , dna polymerase, egt and gp <dig> have previously been used for phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . among those conserved baculovirus genes, pif- <dig> , encoding a per os infectivity factor, and lef- <dig>  encoding a subunit of the baculovirus rna polymerase, proved to be particularly reliable baculovirus markers for phylogenetic analyses at the virus family level  <cit> . a combined phylogenetic analysis of the pif- <dig> and lef- <dig> sequences further showed a clear, highly-supported classification among the four genera, and alphabaculoviruses  can be subdivided into groups i and ii. phylogenetic analysis placed clbinpv in group ii . orf  <dig> in the clbinpv genome encodes a typical f protein, and clbinpv does not encode gp <dig>  which is consistent with its classification as a group ii alphabaculovirus.

the gene order of clbinpv was compared to acmnpv  <cit> , orlenpv and ldmnpv  <cit>  by gene parity plots  <cit> . clbinpv shared  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> orfs with acmnpv, orlenpv and ldmnpv, respectively. in general, gene order is conserved between clbinpv and ldmnpv, and between clbinpv and orlenpv, although three inverted areas, involving clbi25- <dig>  clbi43- <dig> and clbi132- <dig>  are identified when compared with orlenpv. the genomes appear less collinear than acmnpv .

overlapping orf pairs in the sequenced alphabaculovirusgenomes
overlapping orfs in clbinpv were searched and  <dig> pairs were found. the overlapping orf pairs in all sequenced alphabaculovirus genomes were further analysed .

in group i alphabaculoviruses, the numbers of overlapping orf pairs range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . except for ac68/ac <dig> and ac73/ac <dig> in opmnpv, and ac43/ac <dig> in hycunpv, nine  appear in all group i alphabaculoviruses.

in group ii alphabaculoviruses, the numbers of overlapping orf pairs range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . except for several npvs, six overlapping orf pairs  are conserved, and four pairs  exist in all group ii alphabaculoviruses.

altogether, overlapping orf pairs ac81/ac <dig>  ac95/ac <dig>  ac98/ac <dig> and ac102/ac <dig> were conserved in all group i and group ii alphabaculoviruses. these overlapping orf pairs are from the coding regions of ac <dig>  tlp <dig>  helicase, ac <dig>  38k, lef- <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  most of which have conserved functions in npvs.

it was interesting that the numbers of overlapping orfs in all alphabaculoviruses were consistent with the phylogenetic tree constructed using the combined pif- <dig> and lef- <dig> sequences, meaning that closely-related npvs have similar numbers of overlapping orf pairs.

dna photolyase-like gene sequence with a 1-bp deletion
dna photolyase is a monomeric protein that directly repairs lethal and carcinogenic uv-induced dna lesions. it has been found in a variety of pathogens and other organisms  <cit> . however, among the baculoviruses, this enzyme exists only in chchnpv  <cit> , trichoplusia ni npv   <cit>  and spodoptera litura granulovirus .

the complete clbinpv genome sequence analysis revealed the presence of a photolyase-like gene sequence  <dig>  bp in length, which has the highest similarity to chchnpv phr- <dig> using translated blast searches. compared with photolyases among baculoviruses, it is interesting that there was a 1-bp deletion mutation . in order to confirm this deletion, we analyzed the dna fragment library of clbinpv. there were seven colonies including the region with the mutation, and they all contained the 1-bp deletion. to ensure that this mutation was genuinely present in the original sample, pcr and sequencing of the gene region around this mutation were performed using the original clbinpv dna. the sequencing results confirmed that the mutation occurred in this region. this 1-bp deletion mutation disrupted the sequence into two small orfs, labelled phr- <dig>  and phr- <dig>  on the basis of their position in the clbinpv genome relative to the polyhedrin gene . the orf of clbiphr- <dig>  corresponding to the 3' end of chchnpv phr- <dig>  is  <dig> bp long and encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. an early baculoviral transcription initiation motif  was found  <dig> bp upstream of the putative translational start site , suggesting that clbiphr- <dig> might be an early gene. in addition, a gata motif  was found at position - <dig> bp relative to the translational start codon and might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. clbiphr- <dig>  corresponding to the 5' portion of chchnpv phr- <dig>  is  <dig>  bp long and encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. no motifs characteristic of early  or late  baculovirus transcription initiation were found in the sequence upstream of clbiphr- <dig>  two poly motifs  are present at the end of the orf of clbiphr- <dig>  both the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer -dna photolyase domain and the flavin adenine dinucleotide -binding domain, characteristic of photolyases, are conserved in the clbinpv sequence. the cpd-dna photolyase domain is located between amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> in clbiphr- <dig>  and an fad-binding domain is located between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> in clbiphr- <dig> 

baculoviruses are attractive candidates for biological control of insect pests  <cit> . one major factor limiting their successful use in biological control is their sensitivity to inactivation by ultraviolet  radiation  <cit> . the most significant cellular target of uv is dna. when dna is exposed to uv, it is damaged by producing pyrimidine dimers  <cit> , which may block the activities of dna or rna polymerases and result in nucleotide misincorporation or inhibit polymerase progression during dna replication or transcription  <cit> . dna photolyase is a photo-reactivating enzyme that can repair the toxic effects of uv-induced dna damage. van oers et al.  <cit>  suggested that the presence of a cpd-dna photolyase gene in chchnpv might be a remnant of the evolutionary history of baculoviruses, or a recent adaptation to a current ecological niche in chrysodeixis chalcites or an alternative host, which might have given chchnpv a competitive advantage. however, the functional significance of this gene in chchnpv infection has not been proved. we analyzed the photolyase genes in baculoviruses and found that they are almost all early genes expressed before virus dna replication. therefore, we speculate that baculovirus photolyases might play a critical role in repairing dna damage caused by uv, enabling the replication of virus dna to complete successfully. in clbinpv genome, the photolyase-like gene sequence was split into two orfs by the 1-bp deletion. however, at present, we cannot give direct evidence that this mutant affects the function, since no insect cell line permitting clbinpv infection has been found. our further research will focus on confirming the expression pattern of the clbinpv photolyase gene and detecting photolyase activity in baculoviruses.

CONCLUSIONS
our preliminary studies on host range showed that clbinpv infects the larvae of clanis bilineata tiainglauica mell, ampelophaga rubiginosa bremer and grey, theretra odenlandiae  and pergesa elpenor lewisil, and thus could be a candidate biological control agent for a broad spectrum of pests.

clbinpv is a group ii alphabaculovirus and encodes  <dig> orfs. twenty-eight of these are best matched with the orfs of orlenpv, while  <dig> have the highest identities with ldmnpv, tnsnpv and agsenpv. the numbers of orfs best-matched with chchnp, sfmnpv and ecobnpv are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. this coincides with the results of multi-alignment, phylogenetic analysis and the analyses of overlapping orf pairs.

we also found a variant dna photolyase-like gene sequence, which has a 1-bp deletion when compared with photolyases of other baculovirus. this deletion disrupted the sequence into two small photolyase orfs, which correspond to the cpd-dna and fad-binding domains of photolyases, respectively. dna photolyase may reduce lethal or mutagenic effects caused by ultraviolet radiation. this enzyme is present in the genomes of many species ranging from bacteria and yeasts to aplacental mammals such as the opossum  <cit> . in contrast, among the baculoviruses, it has been found only in chchnpv, tnsnpv, spltgv and clbinpv. studies have shown that one major factor limiting the successful use of baculoviruses in biological control is their sensitivity to inactivation by uv radiation. the existence of dna photolyase in these four baculovirus might have played an important role in their evolution and may reduce uv inactivation when applied in the field. however, further investigations are needed to understand the actual functional mechanism of this enzyme in baculoviruses.
