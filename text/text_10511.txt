BACKGROUND
cyclophilins  are ubiquitous proteins found in organisms ranging from archaea and bacteria to plants and animals  <cit> . as they were originally identified as receptors for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine a , cyps are classified in the immunophilin family of proteins possessing peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity. multiple cyps have been found in genomes of various prokaryotes, but only a few have been studied in detail. the escherichia coli genome encodes two cyps, a cytosolic form  and its periplasmic counterpart   <cit> . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae there are at least  <dig> different cyps, cpr <dig> to cpr <dig>  <cit> . these proteins are not essential for growth, but are crucial for survival after heat stress  <cit> . the human genome encodes  <dig> unique cyps, categorized into  <dig> major groups, namely human cyp a , hcyp-b, hcyp-c, hcyp-d, hcyp-e, hcyp- <dig> and hcyp-nk  <cit> . the hcyp-a binds to csa, and forms a ternary complex with calcineurin. the csa-hcyp-a binding to calcineurin inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin that results in a cascade of activities leading to the inactivation of t-cells  <cit> .

compared to human cyps, very little is known about plant cyps. the first plant cyps were identified concurrently from tomato , maize , and oilseed rape   <cit> . recently, with the availability of whole genome sequencing, the identification and characterization of plant cyps has progressed substantially. however, compared to other organisms, the total number of plant cyps in databases is still small, which suggests that many plant cyps remain to be identified  <cit> . to date, arabidopsis thaliana and rice  are the two plant species reported to have highest number of cyps with  <dig> atcyps  <cit>  and  <dig> oscyps  <cit> , respectively. among the identified atcyps, only  <dig> are characterized at the molecular level . their encoded proteins are found in the cytoplasm  <cit> , endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> , chloroplast  <cit> , and nucleus  <cit> . an increase in the expression of roc <dig>  an atcyp, in response to light is associated with phytochromes and cryptochromes  <cit> . roc <dig> mutants display an early flowering phenotype  <cit> , while gain-of-function mutations in roc <dig> reduce stem elongation and increase shoot branching  <cit> . in contrast, loss-of-function mutations in atcyp <dig> reduce the number of juvenile leaves, with no change in inflorescence morphology or flowering time, and arabidopsis plants with a defective atcyp20- <dig> are found to be hypersensitive to oxidative stress conditions created by high light and high salt levels, and osmotic shock  <cit> . in addition to the atcyps having roles in various developmental processes, atcyp <dig>  a multi-domain cyp with a rna recognition motif , regulates transcription and pre-mrna processing by binding to the c-terminal domain of rna polymerase ii  <cit> . collectively, these results show the roles of arabidopsis cyps in different cellular pathways, which necessitate further work to explore the function associated with each of the cyps.

compared to the arabidopsis cyps, little work has been done on the rice cyps. most of the studies on the latter show their roles in different types of stresses. oscyp <dig> has been reported to have a role in different abiotic stress responses  <cit> . the expression of oscyp <dig> is up-regulated towards salt stress, and its over-expression in rice enhances tolerance towards the salt stress. similarly, overexpression in arabidopsis and tobacco of the thylakoid-localized oscyp20- <dig> increased tolerance towards osmotic stress, and to extremely high light conditions  <cit> . the expression levels of several other oscyps were increased by abiotic stresses such as desiccation and salt stress  <cit> , indicating a critical role of oscyps during stress conditions.

soybean  is a legume plant belonging to the papilionoideae family and is a rich source of protein, oil and plant natural products such as isoflavonoids. the soybean genome contains  <dig>  protein coding loci located on  <dig> different chromosomes. soybean has undergone two whole genome duplication events approximately  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago, as a result of which 75% of the genes have multiple copies  <cit> . until now, not much was known about soybean cyps except that a handful of cyp gene sequences had been deposited in the public databases. we present here a genome-wide identification of soybean cyps, their phylogenetic analysis, chromosomal distribution, and structural and expressional analysis. our results indicate that soybean contains  <dig> cyps, the largest family of cyp known to date in any organism. further, the study describes a genome-wide segmental and tandem duplication during expansion of the gmcyp gene family.

RESULTS
the soybean genome contains  <dig> putative gmcyps
to identify all the members of the cyp gene family in soybean, a blastn search of the soybean genome database g. max wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig>  was performed using the nucleotide sequence of a previously identified soybean cyp cdna  as a query. this search identified  <dig> unique cyp genes. each of the  <dig> cyp genes was used separately as a query sequence in the blast search of soybean genome database. this process was repeated until no new cyp gene was found. a total of  <dig> soybean cyps, located on  <dig> different chromosomes, were identified and named gmcyp <dig> to gmcyp <dig> . of the  <dig> gmcyps,  <dig> encoded a protein with a single cyclophilin-like domain  which is responsible for the cis/trans isomerization of the peptidyl prolyl peptide bond. the remaining  <dig> gmcyps contained the cld and additional domains. as shown in figureÂ  <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  and gmcyp <dig> each contained two tetratricopeptide repeats  at the c-terminus. the tpr motif is degenerate in nature and consists of a  <dig> amino acid repeat unit typically arranged in tandem arrays  <cit> . such tpr motif containing proteins mediate protein-protein interactions and often help in the assembly of multi-protein complexes. atcyp <dig> , the arabidopsis ortholog of gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  and gmcyp <dig>  contains  <dig> tprs and is involved in microrna-mediated gene regulation  <cit> . loss-of-function mutation of atcyp <dig> showed a precocious phase change with reduced number of juvenile leaves, but no alteration of flowering time  <cit> . moreover, the conserved amino acids of the tpr domain of atcyp <dig> are required for the interaction between atcyp <dig> and cytoplasmic hsp <dig> proteins. this interaction is essential for the function of atcyp <dig> in planta  <cit>  suggesting a critical role for the tpr domain in microrna-mediated gene regulation. here we speculate a possibly similar function for the tpr domain in gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig> and/or gmcyp <dig> table  <dig>

schematic representation of multi-domain gmcyps. cld, cyclophilin-like-domain; tpr, tetratricopeptide repeat; wd, tryptophan-aspartate repeat; rrm, rna recognition motif; zk, zink knuckle, u-box, u-box domain.



gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> contain three tryptophan-aspartate  repeats at the n-terminus . wd repeat-containing proteins are involved in a wide variety of cellular functions, providing binding sites for two or more proteins, or fostering transient interactions with other proteins  <cit> . the arabidopsis cyp, atcyp <dig> , contains  <dig> wd repeats  <cit>  and functions in chromatin remodelling  <cit> . the very high sequence identity of atcyp <dig> with gmcyp <dig>  and gmcyp <dig>  suggests that these two gmcyps may play similar roles in soybean.

the sequence analysis identified two soybean cyps, gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig>  having an rna recognition motif  and zinc knuckle  at the c-terminus along with cld at the n-terminus end . rrm is a small rna binding motif of  <dig> amino acids and is conserved in a wide variety of organisms  <cit> . atcyp <dig> , the arabidopsis ortholog of gmcyp <dig>  and gmcyp <dig>    <cit> , contains an rrm motif, and is a transcriptional regulator  <cit>  that interacts with the conserved sequence of unprocessed mrna, leading to the inhibition of the ppiase activity in vitro  <cit> . based on the functional association of atcyp <dig> in transcriptional regulation, we speculate that the multi-domain soybean cyps gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> possibly play a role in regulation of transcription in soybean via their rrms.

lastly, gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> contain a u-box at the n-terminus end of the protein. the u-box domain is highly conserved in some ubiquitin ligases and predicted to be a part of the ubiquitination machinery. mammalian cyc <dig> and arabidopsis atcyp <dig> are the u-box containing cyp where the cyp domain is predicted to have chaperone function  <cit> .

of the  <dig> gmcyps, it was ascertained that  <dig> contain a chloroplast transit peptide,  <dig> contain a signal peptide,  <dig> contain a mitochondrial targeting peptide,  <dig> contain a nuclear localization signal, and the remaining  <dig> are cytosolic . unlike arabidopsis and rice cyps  <cit> , none of the soybean cyps are predicted to be localized to the er or golgi or plasma membrane. only one secretory gmcyp, gmcyp <dig>  is predicted for localization in the mitochondrial inner membrane or plasma membrane. a search for er retention signal did not locate kdel or hdel in any gmcyp. we also searched for cyp genes in the dfci soybean gene index that contains  <dig> , <dig> ests representing  <dig>  tc sequences . screening this database confirmed that  <dig> of the  <dig> gmcyp genes we identified were represented with 99-100% identity, and 100% coverage, implying that at least 25% of the gmcyps are transcribed in various soybean tissues during normal growth and development, or in response to stress. additionally,  <dig> gmcyps displayed greater than 95% sequence identity with tc sequences in the soybean est database, but with less than 100% query coverage. the lower sequence identities could be due simply to cultivar-specific sequence differences between the two databases, with the whole genome sequence originating solely from the cultivar williams <dig>  <cit> , and the dfci soybean gene index comprising est data from cdna libraries of several different soybean cultivars, the number of transcribed gmcyps in soybean can be expected to be more than  <dig>  a list of all the soybean cyp gene family members and their detailed information is provided in additional file  <dig> 

chromosomal distribution and phylogenetic analysis of soybean cyp genes
to determine the genome organization and distribution of gmcyps on different chromosomes in soybean, a chromosome map was constructed. the results showed that the  <dig> gmcyps are located on  <dig> different chromosomes. as depicted in figureÂ  <dig>  the gene density per chromosome is uneven. chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> contain the most, and show a relatively dense occurrence of cyp genes , whereas only one cyp  is present on chromosome  <dig>  no cyps were found on chromosome  <dig> or  <dig>  most gmcyps were localized towards the chromosome ends, and only gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> were found near centromeres , suggesting the possibility of inter-chromosomal rearrangements, after genome duplication, between different soybean chromosomes.figure  <dig>

. chromosomal locations of gmcyps are indicated based on the location of the genes, length of chromosomes and positions of centromeres. the chromosomes are drawn to scale and chromosome numbers are shown under each chromosome. the gmcyps that are clustered together and speculated to have undergone segmental duplication are indicated by shaded boxes of the same color and connected to each other by a line. centromeres are indicated by blue ovals.



to explore the evolutionary relationship among soybean cyps, a phylogenetic analysis was performed using their predicted amino acid sequences . as observed for many other genes in soybean, most of the predicted gmcyps clustered together in pairs, reflecting the ancient genome duplication event  <cit> . such events result in two copies of each gene which undergo shuffling and rearrangement, creating the potential for new diversity. there are four possible fates of duplicated genes  <cit> . first, one copy of the gene may be deleted during the course of evolution, resulting in loss of functional redundancy. second, both copies of the genes may be retained and share the ancestral function, but gradually develop partially different functions . third, one copy of the gene may acquire new function during the course of evolution . finally, there may be an intermediate stage between sub- and neo-functionalization. which of these outcomes occur depends on the role of the specific gene in plant growth and development. only those genes that are associated with critical functions for normal plant growth and development are retained, while others may be lost. the large number of cyps present in the soybean genome thus likely reflects a combination of duplication and the important role of gmcyps in soybean during normal growth and development, as well as in response to environmental stimuli.figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic relationships of gmcyp proteins. a neighbor-joining tree was generated by mega <dig>  software  <cit>  using putative amino acid sequence of  <dig> gmcyps, and the tree was annotated using interactive tree of life  <cit> . the numbers next to the branch shows the  <dig> bootstrap replicates expressed in percentage. the solid line represents the real branch length and dotted lines added later for better visualization. the multi-domain cyps are underlined and the predicted subcellular locations of gmcyps are shown by colors as indicated.



of the  <dig> gmcyps,  <dig> are clustered in pairs  in the phylogenetic tree. the remaining  <dig> gmcyps branched-off from the terminal branch of another pair of gmcyps. this analysis further revealed that the multi-domain gmcyps cluster together.

we also attempted to correlate the clustering of gmcyps in the phylogenetic tree with their predicted subcellular localization. interestingly, the gmcyps predicted to be targeted to the same subcellular compartment grouped together as a separate clade. for example, gmcyps with chloroplast transit peptide  formed a distinct clade on the tree. another  <dig> chloroplast-localizing gmcyps  also formed a distinct clade, but in a different location on the tree. similarly, the gmcyps with nuclear localization signal  also formed separate clades on the tree . a similar pattern of gene clustering was observed for the gmcyps predicted to localize in mitochondria or that were secretory.

by comparing the positions of gmcyps on the chromosome map  and in the phylogenetic tree , an interesting grouping pattern was observed. if the gmcyps were localized together on a chromosome, their paralogs were also found together on a different chromosome. for example, gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  and gmcyp <dig> are clustered at the sub-telomere region of chromosome  <dig>  and are most similar to gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  and gmcyp <dig>  respectively, which are clustered together in the sub-telomere region of chromosome  <dig> . similarly, gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  and gmcyp <dig>  paired with gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  and gmcyp <dig>  respectively, from chromosome  <dig>  and gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig>  paired with gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig>  respectively , whereas gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig>  paired with gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> . moreover, gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig>  from chromosome  <dig>  paired up with gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig>  respectively, from chromosome  <dig>  these findings provide strong evidence for segmental duplication of chromosomal regions containing the gmcyps, such as has been shown to play a vital role in the evolutionary generation of members of other gene families  <cit> .

gene structures of gmcyps
analysis of the exon-intron structure of the gmcyp genes showed several variations . six gmcyp genes  contained no intron in their open reading frame . the number of introns varied from  <dig> to  <dig> in the orfs of other gmcyp genes. the gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> contained a single intron in their orf while the largest numbers of introns were found in gmcyp <dig>  the size of intron also varied considerably between different gmcyp gene family members with their size ranging from 39Â bp  to 9359Â bp  in the primary transcripts. several other genes such as gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp39-gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp51- gmcyp <dig>  gmcyp55- gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> contained introns larger than  <dig> Â kb in their orfs. it has been suggested that the genome size may be correlated with intron size and that some elements of genome size evolution occurs within the gene  <cit> . however, in gossypium sps., intron and genome size evolution are not coupled  <cit> . in the regions of low recombination, longer introns are selectively advantageous as they improve recombination and possibly counterbalance the mutational bias towards deletion  <cit> . a large-scale comparative analysis of intron positions among different kingdoms  identified a large number of positions that are likely to be ancestral  <cit> . analysis of intron sizes and positions in paralogs among gmcyp family did not show any specific pattern. however, in the majority of cases, the exon-intron numbers were similar in the genes that clustered together in the phylogenetic tree , for example, gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> or gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> or gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig>  the 5â² and 3â² untranslated regions  that border protein-coding sequences are important structural and regulatory elements of eukaryotic genes  <cit>  and also contain large numbers of introns  <cit> . out of  <dig> gmcyps,  <dig> contained a single intron in the 5â²utr region while remaining gmcyps consisted of intronless 5â²utr. the 3â²utr of two gmcyps, gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig>  were interrupted by a single intron whereas gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> introns, respectively. the number of exon and intron in each gmcyp gene is shown in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

expression analysis of gmcyp genes
to determine expression patterns of gmcyp genes, we used publicly-available genome-wide transcript profiling data of soybean tissues as a resource . the dataset contains rnaseq reads from soybean seeds across several stages of seed development , and reproductive  and vegetative  tissues. as shown in figureÂ  <dig>  most of the gmcyp genes showed distinct tissue-specific expression pattern. out of the  <dig> gmcyp genes,  <dig> were expressed in the vegetative tissues whereas  <dig> were expressed in floral buds and different stages of seed development. two gmcyps, gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig>  contained no sequence read in any of the soybean tissues included in the study. in addition, there were no est or tc sequences in the dfci gene index database with a perfect match to gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> . these evidences indicated that gmcyp <dig> and gmcyp <dig> are pseudogenes or expressed under special conditions or at specific developmental stages. the gene expression data revealed that the majority of gmcyps  were expressed in leaf tissue with the highest transcript accumulation level. furthermore, it is interesting to note that the gmcyps predicted to localize in the chloroplast were expressed in leaf tissues, suggesting their possible role in photosynthesis. expression of several gmcyp genes in seed tissues during development indicates an important role of these genes in seed development.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we have performed a comprehensive sequence analysis of soybean cyp genes , and provided detailed information on them. specifically, our results show that the soybean genome contains  <dig> cyp genes, the largest cyp gene family identified in any organism to date. the presence of predicted motifs, subcellular localization and their sequence homology with other identified cyps from other organisms provided insight into their putative function. results of the present study indicate a genome-wide segmental and tandem duplication during expansion of the gmcyp gene family.
