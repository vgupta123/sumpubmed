BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subsp hominissuis is an environmental organism commonly found in soil and water  <cit> . mycobacterium hominissuis causes disseminated disease in immunocompromised people such as in aids patients, and disease in patients suffering from chronic pulmonary conditions  <cit> . the bacterium preferentially infects tissue macrophages and blood monocytes. once inside a macrophage, the bacterium has been shown to inhibit the acidification of the phagosome and subsequently prevent the fusion between the phagosome and lysosome  <cit> , which are key stages of phagocytes mechanisms of killing of intracellular microorganisms  <cit> . similar to mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , salmonella  <cit>  and leishmania  <cit> , m. hominissuis interferes with the endosome maturation process which precedes phagosome-lysosome fusion. the mechanisms that m. hominissuis uses to survive within macrophages have been an active area of research. previous reports have shown that m. hominissuis has the ability to modulate the intracellular environment, remaining accessible to internalized transferrin and limiting the proteolytic activity, maintaining cathepsin d in an immature form  <cit> . other studies, for example, malik and colleagues, have suggested inhibition of calcium signaling by another pathogenic mycobacterium  is responsible for the prevention of phagosome-lysosome fusion  <cit> . li and colleagues  <cit> , screening of m. hominissuis transposon mutant bank for clones with attenuated in human macrophages, identified a 2d <dig> mutant in which the transposon interrupted mav_ <dig> a ppe gene . mav_ <dig> is expressed primarily upon macrophage phagocytosis  <cit> . the 2d <dig> mutant was significantly attenuated in macrophages in comparison to the wild-type bacterium although both bacteria had comparable ability to enter the phagocytic cells. in addition, vacuoles containing the 2d <dig> mutant could not prevent the acidification and subsequent fusion with the lysosomes.

the pe, ppe, and pe-pgrs families of genes in mycobacteria are dispersed throughout the genomes of m. tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, m. hominissuis and mycobacterium paratuberculosis. it was previously assumed that m. hominissuis and m. paratuberculosis lack pe-pgrs family of proteins  <cit> , but we have recently found pe-pgrs proteins in m. hominissuis . these families of proteins have been associated with virulence of mycobacteria  <cit> , and some of the proteins have been identified on the bacterial surface  <cit> . the function of the majority of ppe proteins is unknown. recently, work with m. tuberculosis has demonstrated that ppes are associated with the rd <dig> operon and participate in the secretion of esat- <dig> and cfp- <dig>  two proteins associated with m. tuberculosis virulence  <cit> .

early events during the infection are likely to influence the characteristics of the macrophage vacuole. mav_ <dig> gene in m. hominissuis, homologue to m. tuberculosis rv <dig>  is expressed upon entry in macrophages and, therefore, may participate in the establishment of the m. hominissuis environment within the phagocytic cell. very little has been published on the proteins that make the bacterial vacuole. a study by gagnon and colleagues  <cit>  described the membrane proteins of latex bead vacuoles. although some of the bacterial vacuole proteins have been determined, it is unknown how vacuoles recruit most of the proteins, and if bacterial vacuoles differ depending on the pathogen present within it. previous studies have demonstrated that the intravacuolar environment is influenced by pathogens  <cit> . whether this ability is related, at least in part, to changes in vacuole membrane is currently unknown. the intent of this research was to investigate whether the lack of a functional mav_ <dig> would have any influence on the vacuole structure and intravacuolar environment.

RESULTS
differential gene induction in u <dig> cells after infection with mac  <dig> and 2d <dig> attenuated mutant by dna microarray
because the mav_ <dig>  homologue to rv <dig>  was shown to be upregulated upon initial contact between m. avium and macrophages, we decided to examine whether and how the macrophage transcription varies upon 2d <dig> mutant uptake compared to the gene expression triggered by the uptake of the wild-type bacterium. tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the genes differentially regulated when comparing the wild-type bacterium and the 2d <dig> mutant. the genes induced in cells infected with wild-type bacteria, but not in cells infected with the 2d <dig> mutant, consisted mainly of those involved in intracellular signaling, such as lck, pkia, dgka, dgkd, inpp <dig>  apba <dig> and pde1c. a few other genes were involved in the metabolic pathways, such as gpd <dig>  and cyp4f <dig> . additional genes that showed induction were ppm1g , hipk <dig> and rorc , itk , grk <dig> , nfkb <dig>  and others. the genes with decreased expression in wild-type but upregulated in 2d <dig> mutant included genes involved in signal transduction , apoptosis , bacterial uptake , immune response , metabolic pathways , and others, such as bacterial killing , negative regulators of g-protein signaling , potassium channel regulator , microtubule movement .

macrophage gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time pcr
to confirm the changes in macrophage gene expression level upon infection with m. avium or its isogenic 2d <dig> mutant from the dna microarray data findings, real-time pcr analysis was used to amplify grk <dig> , dgkd , both upregulated in the wild-type but down-regulated in the 2d <dig> mutant infected macrophages, and lcp <dig>  down-regulated in wild-type but upregulated in the 2d <dig> mutant. the gene Î²-actin was used as a positive control, while the uninfected cells were used as a negative control. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the two genes grk <dig> and dgkd showed significant expression upon m. avium infection of macrophages, in contrast to infection by the 2d <dig> mutant. in addition, the lcp <dig> gene showed significant increased expression in macrophages upon infection with 2d <dig> mutant, in contrast to wild-type infected macrophages. none of the three genes showed upregulation in the uninfected negative control cells.

mass spectrometry analysis of isolated wild-type m. avium and 2d <dig> phagosomes
several of the genes differentially regulated in macrophages upon uptake of the wild-type bacterium or the 2d <dig> mutants are involved in signal pathways and g-protein receptor, which suggests an early diversification when comparing both bacterial strains. it was then hypothesized that mav_ <dig> may be linked to the composition of the vacuole membrane. to examine the hypothesis, we first performed proteomic analysis in purified macrophage vacuoles. as shown in fig. 2a and 2b, purified phagosomes of cells infected with mac  <dig> or 2d <dig> were obtained. the ms/ms results of the phagosome membranes revealed several proteins with function in bacterial uptake, antigen presentation and recognition, rab-interacting proteins, cytoskeleton and motor proteins, proteins involved in biosynthetic pathways, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction proteins. several of the proteins also have function as ion channels. a number of hypothetical proteins were also identified . some proteins observed were unique to mac  <dig> or the 2d <dig> vacuoles at different time points. together, these results suggest that the phagosomes with wild-type bacterium express a number of unique proteins, different from the vacuole of the 2d <dig> mutant. a proteomic analysis was attempted from vacuoles of uninfected macrophages. the results obtained were variable, probably reflecting the difference of the nature of the vacuoles .

immunofluorescence analysis
many proteins identified in the mass spectrometry data have not previously been described in m. avium phagosomes. to confirm the data obtained by proteomic analysis, we used fluorescence microscopy to establish the presence of some selected proteins. one of the proteins, pulmonary surfactant protein d , was observed to be selectively expressed in the mac  <dig> phagosomes at  <dig> h time point but not in the 2d <dig> phagosomes. the second protein, t-type ca++ channel  <dig> alpha, showed selective expression in 2d <dig> phagosomes at  <dig> h after infection and not in the mac  <dig> phagosomes.

sp-d is a carbohydrate binding glycoprotein and has been shown to be involved in ligand binding and immune cell recognition  <cit> . to confirm the expression of sp-d on mac  <dig> vacuoles at  <dig> h time point, cells were infected in parallel with fluorescein-labeled bacteria  for  <dig> h. the sp-d protein was observed to be present in nearly all on the mac  <dig> vacuoles . in vacuoles with the 2d6-mutant, as well as in uninfected, macrophage, no sp-d was co-localized with m. avium . quantification is shown in fig.  <dig>  this finding confirmed our data that sp-d is expressed in mac  <dig> phagosomes but not in 2d <dig> mutant phagosomes at  <dig> h time point. the protein was also seen in the membrane of infected macrophages.

to investigate whether the complemented m. avium 2d <dig> mutant phagosomes showed similar protein expression as that of wild-type, we infected the cells with 2d <dig> complemented bacteria  <cit>  for  <dig> h, with mac  <dig> as a positive control. the vacuoles containing the complemented m. avium 2d <dig> mutant showed expression of sp-d protein  similarly to vacuoles containing the wild-type bacterium , though the percentage of infected cells showing the protein expression was 15% less than in macrophages infected with the wild-type bacterium. quantification of expression is shown in fig.  <dig> 

t-type ca++ channel is an integral membrane protein, which controls the rapid entry of ca++ into excitable cells, and is activated by cam-kinase ii . to verify our initial observation by ms/ms, we carried out parallel infection assays with fluorescein-labeled 2d <dig> and mac  <dig> bacteria for  <dig> h. as shown in fig. 6a and 6b, the majority of the cells infected with 2d <dig> mutant showed t-type ca++ channel protein staining; whereas, those infected with the wild-type mac  <dig> and uninfected control u <dig> cells failed to express the protein . the observation was in agreement with the proteomic data showing that t-type ca++ channel is expressed in mononuclear phagocytes infected with 2d <dig> attenuated mutant, but not when infected with mac  <dig> 

to determine whether the phagosomes of macrophages infected with the complemented m. avium 2d <dig> mutant phagosomes failed to express the t-type ca++ channel, mononuclear cells infected with complemented m. avium 2d <dig> bacteria and 2d6-attenuated mutant were evaluated. as shown in fig. 7a and 7b, vacuoles with the complemented bacteria, in contrast to the 2d <dig> mutant , did not express t-type ca++ channel protein. quantification of the t-type ca++ channel protein in macrophages infected with mac  <dig>  the 2d <dig> mutant and complemented 2d <dig> strain are shown in fig.  <dig> 

the expression of eea- <dig>  creb- <dig>  and tnfri were also quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy, as shown in fig. 9-fig.  <dig>  expression of eea- <dig>  creb- <dig> and tnfri proteins was selectively observed after macrophage infection with 2d <dig> bacteria but not in the vacuoles of macrophages infected with the wild-type bacterium. western blot analysis showed that eea- <dig> and creb- <dig> proteins were only expressed in vacuoles occupied by the 2d <dig> mutant and not the wild-type bacteria. marco, a protein shown by the mass spectrometry to be expressed differently in macrophages infected by the mutant and wild-type bacterium, was present in the vacuole membrane of the wild-type bacterium at  <dig> min but not in 2d <dig> mutant vacuole. the expression decreased significantly in the vacuole of the wild-type m. avium at  <dig> h but increased significantly in the vacuoles of 2d <dig> mutants .

x-ray microscopy measures of intravacuolar concentrations of elements
because the changes in the vacuole membrane might translate into changes in the vacuole environment, we carried out hard x-ray microscopy to evaluate the level of single elements within the bacterial vacuole. we observed that, at  <dig> h after infection, the concentration of mn++ and zn++ were significantly higher in vacuoles occupied by the 2d <dig> mutant than in vacuoles of the wild-type bacterium. at  <dig> h, the concentration of mn++ remained similar in vacuoles with the 2d <dig> mutant but decreased in vacuoles of the wild-type organism. the concentrations of ca++ and k+ also decreased over time in 2d <dig> mutant vacuoles, becoming significantly different from the wild-type bacterium . the concentration of zn++, while still significantly different between the wild-type bacterium and the 2d <dig> mutant, also decreased over time . the concentration of iron in the vacuole of 2d <dig> mutant did not differ from the concentration in vacuoles with the wild-type bacterium.

discussion
m. avium, like m. tuberculosis, primarily infects the host mononuclear phagocytes. targeting mononuclear phagocytes and being able to survive within the presence of efficient mechanisms of macrophage subversion, evolved by virulent.

in m. tuberculosis, pe-pgrs and ppe are two families of glycine-rich protein which constitute approximately 10% of the m. tuberculosis genome. recent reports have suggested that these two gene families might be involved in antigen variation, eukaryotic cell binding, survival within macrophages and persistence in granulomas  <cit> . richardson and colleagues  showed that a ppe protein  is expressed on the bacterial surface. using signature-tagged mutagenesis, camacho and colleagues identified a ppe gene  associated with m. tuberculosis virulence in vivo  <cit> . in addition, ramakrishnan and colleagues observed that inactivation of pe-pgrs gene in mycobacterium marinum resulted in attenuation of bacterial virulence in macrophages  <cit> . in a recent report, li and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that an m. avium strain lacking a functional ppe protein, mav_ <dig> , is attenuated in vivo and fails to inhibit both acidification of the vacuole, as well as phagosome-lysosome fusion. mycobacterium avium mav_ <dig> transposon mutant had comparable ability to enter the mononuclear phagocytes as the wild-type bacterium. the expression of mav_ <dig> was noted following uptake of the wild-type bacterium by macrophages but not in culture media, suggesting a possible participation in the early events of the intracellular stage and possibly in phagosome formation  <cit> .

the gene mav_ <dig> is part of an m. avium chromosomal region with five ppe and pe genes, adjacent to the region homologous to the rd <dig> region in m. tuberculosis. the organization of this region suggests the existence of three promoters, one upstream of mav_ <dig> inactivated in the 2d <dig> mutant, one between the second, and the third genes and another between the fourth and fifth genes in the downstream region  <cit> . this specific region is also upstream of a region homologous to the rd <dig> region of m. tuberculosis. a ppe gene adjacent to the rd <dig> region in m. tuberculosis has been suggested to be associated with the transport of proteins  <cit> . because mav_ <dig> is co-transcribed with mav_ <dig>  it is possible that some of the findings are due to the downstream gene. complementation of the 2d <dig> mutant, however, has shown that most of the function lost with the inactivation of mav_ <dig> is recovered  <cit> . interestingly, mav_ <dig> has a high degree of homology with mav_ <dig>  but, based on the phenotype obtained with the inactivation of mav_ <dig>  we assume that the genes probably have unique functions.

usually, upon bacterial uptake, a macrophage undergoes a series of events specifically designed to eliminate the engulfed microorganism. these include induction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, gradual acidification of the phagosome, phagosome-lysosome fusion which loads the resulting compartment with acidic proteolytic enzymes, and antigen processing and presentation. the resulting lethal environment effectively kills the majority of the ingested bacteria. pathogenic mycobacterial phagosomes, in contrast, show incomplete luminal acidification and absence of mature lysosomal hydrolases  <cit> . malik et al.  <cit>  suggested that m. tuberculosis manipulation of calcium is in part responsible for the phagosome maturation arrest. the pathogenic mycobacterial phagosome has been shown to alter the trafficking of the plasma membrane markers, including mhc molecules  <cit> , eea- <dig> and lamp- <dig>  <cit> . m. tuberculosis-related blocking of phagosome maturation in macrophages appears to take place between the maturation stages controlled by early endocytic marker rab <dig> and late endocytic marker rab <dig>  <cit> . the published data indicate that virulent mycobacterial phagosomes are selective in their fusion with various cytoplasmic organelles and do not mature into a phagosome-lysosome. currently unknown is whether this ability to impact the docking and incorporation of proteins in the phagosome membrane is due completely, or partially, to the proteins that form the phagosome membrane is currently unknown. it is a plausible possibility. this interpretation could explain the differences between the vacuole proteomic between both bacterial strains.

based on the results obtained in the macrophage transcriptome following infecting with m. avium or the 2d <dig> clone, it is clear that the mutant stimulates membrane-based signals and receptors that are bypassed by the wild-type bacterium.

mass spectrometry analysis of the phagosomal proteins of 2d <dig> mutant and the wild-type bacterium yielded several differences in the protein expression in the vacuole membrane. for example, expression of eea- <dig> and rab <dig> effectors was seen on 2d <dig> phagosomes but not on the wild-type phagosomes, which is in agreement with the observation reported by fratti et al. and via et al.  <cit> . the upregulation of rab <dig> on the 2d6-infected macrophages indicates that the 2d <dig> mutant expresses late endosome markers and undergoes phagolysosome fusion  <cit> .

a relatively large body of published data suggests the role of complement receptors cr <dig>  cr <dig> and cr <dig>  <cit>  and a mannose receptor  <cit>  in the uptake of m. tuberculosis by macrophages. it has been shown that cr <dig> is one of the main receptors involved in phagocytosis of m. avium by macrophages and monocytes  <cit> . the cr <dig> was identified among various receptors on m. avium phagosomes. studies have suggested an important role of cr1/ <dig>  cr <dig> and cr <dig> in host defense against streptococcus pneumoniae infections  <cit> . functional studies have demonstrated that cr <dig> mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of  <dig> kda nucleolin and its interaction with phosphatidylinositol  <dig> kinase  <cit> .

surfactant-associated proteins a and d  are pulmonary collectins that bind to bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens and have multiple classes of receptors on both pneumocytes and macrophages  <cit> . in addition, they act as chemoattractant to phagocytes. surfactant proteins a and d  participate in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens and contribute to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung  <cit> . ferguson and colleagues showed that sp-d binds to m. tuberculosis, resulting in decreased uptake and inhibition of bacterial growth  <cit> . the presence of sp-d in phagosomes mac  <dig> suggests a host attempt to eliminate the pathogen. surfactant protein a  expressed on m. tuberculosis vacuoles has been shown to be involved in enhancing the uptake of bacteria by macrophages  <cit> .

the lack of mhc class ii molecule expression in m. avium phagosomes, and its presence in the attenuated 2d <dig> mutant phagosomes in our data, is in agreement with the above findings that mhc class ii molecules are down-regulated upon mycobacterial infection  <cit> . the mhc class i molecules are involved in presentation of the antigens located in the cytoplasm. the fact that mhc class i molecules were found on 2d <dig> mutant phagosomes, at  <dig> h time point, may reflect altered trafficking by the bacteria. in addition, mhc class i expression at early time points on the phagosome would suggest that the protein being present on the cell surface, during phagocytosis, would have been ingested upon during vacuole formation. the presence of mhc class i molecules on the 2d <dig> phagosomes could also be due to the fact that mycobacterial antigens are processed by mhc class i  <cit> . the mhc class i has been reported to be present on latex bead phagosomes  <cit> .

several proteins not previously shown to be associated with the mycobacterial phagosomes were identified in the phagosomal preparations. because we could not completely rule out the possibility of contamination of the phagosome preparations with other organelles, which indeed is a limiting factor of most subcellular fractionation techniques, we confirmed the findings by identifying proteins by fluorescence microscopy and western blot. recent studies on legionella and brucella have shown that these organisms reside in compartments displaying features of endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . in addition, there is evidence of recruitment of endoplasmic reticulum  to nascent phagosomes containing inert particles or leishmania and having a major contribution to the phagosomal membrane  <cit> . this explains how antigens of vacuolar pathogens are presented to t lymphocytes via mhc class i machinery located on er. considering this information, it would be plausible to find er particles on mycobacterial phagosomes. some of the mitochondrial proteins, such as atp synthase and hsp <dig> found in our preparations, have also been shown to be present in latex bead containing phagosomes  <cit> .

a recent report on the elemental analysis of m. avium phagosomes in balb/c mouse macrophages revealed high concentrations of potassium and chlorine at  <dig> h time point and correlated it to the microbiocidal killing similar to that observed in neutrophils  <cit> . the increase in expression of chp  in the 2d6-infected macrophages, added to the finding that k-cl co-transporter is also increased  on the 2d <dig> mutant phagosomes at  <dig> h time point, could support, at least in part, the above published report, since the 2d <dig> mutant is unable to survive within the macrophages  <cit> . therefore, there is a possibility that k-cl transporter and chp could be involved in the augmentation of the potassium and chlorine concentrations in the phagosome, leading to mutant killing, but this will have to be tested in future work. because of the observed difference in vacuole membrane between the two tested bacterial strains, it was hypothesized that the difference might impact the content of the metals in the vacuole environment.

measurement of the intravacuolar concentration of single elements demonstrates that the 2d <dig> mutant's vacuole is depleted of several important elements at  <dig> h after infection. the decrease in the intravacuolar concentrations of ca++ and zn++ suggests that the wild-type bacteria are capable of retaining the elements, but the ppe mutant is not, probably indicating that the mutant cannot suppress the transport mechanisms or cannot continue to induce uptake of the metals.

we studied protein expression of the mycobacterial phagosome and compared it to a isogenic mutant. we identified several proteins, either previously described or not reported to be present on the phagosomes. the modifications appear to have a significant effect on the intravacuolar environments. nonetheless, the use of the mav_ <dig> mutant established the possibility that one protein may have key function in modulating the formation of the phagosome, perhaps by altering initial events. alternatively, the ppe-pe operon may be part of a complex system influencing or impacting the expression of other bacterial genes or involved in the transport of bacterial proteins. change in single element concentrations in the bacterial environment can have significant effect on gene regulation  <cit> . future studies will address some of the differences found and will possibly provide insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and survival of mycobacteria inside the host.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig>  inactivation of mav_ <dig> alters early stages of macrophage transcription in response to mac infection.

 <dig>  absence of mav_ <dig> affects the concentration of materials inside the mac vacuole, indicating changes in the transport mechanisms.

 <dig>  investigation of the phagosome membrane components revealed unexpected results for the action of only one protein, suggesting that mav_ <dig> may be involved in the transport of other proteins into the host cell.

 <dig>  future studies will attempt to identify proteins that are secreted by the ppe mav_2928-dependent mechanism.
