BACKGROUND
the genomes of higher eukaryotes encode small rnas  that direct transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing . in plants, srnas can be categorized into two major classes including micrornas  and small interfering rnas  which are distinguished by their precursor molecules and different modes of biogenesis .

mirnas are derived from primary mirna  transcripts that form an imperfect fold-back structure  <cit> . the pri-mirna is then processed in a two-step pathway by a dicer-like  ribonuclease, typically dcl <dig>  to produce mirna/mirna* duplexes which are methylated and exported to the cytoplasm  <cit> . alternative pathways for mirna biogenesis involving dcl <dig> or dcl <dig> have also been described  <cit> . the mirna is then selectively incorporated into the argonaute  <dig> -containing rna-induced silencing complex  and thereby directs cleavage or translational inhibition of the target mrna .

the second major class of srnas, includes sirnas that are generated from long double-stranded rnas  resulting from the activity of rna-dependent rna polymerases  that are sliced by dcl activities into sirna duplexes  <cit> . thus, the most distinguishing feature of sirna biogenesis is the requirement of rdr activity for generation of sirna precursors, whereas mirnas have single-stranded rna precursors and do not require rdr activity for their biosynthesis. plant sirnas can be further categorized as heterochromatic sirnas , secondary sirnas , and natural antisense transcript-derived sirnas   <cit> . production and function of each class of sirnas has very consistent requirements for specific members of the dcl, rdr and ago gene families. whereas dcl <dig> is mainly involved in the generation of nat-sirnas  <cit> , dcl <dig> is responsible for the processing of rdr2-generated dsrna and gives rise to 24-nt hc-sirnas  <cit> . dcl <dig> acts mainly in the biogenesis of ta-sirnas in an rdr6-dependent manner  <cit> . as for ago proteins, the core components of the risc complex, ago <dig> primarily binds mirnas and ago <dig> binds hc-sirnas .

mirnas and sirnas are further distinguished by their dependency on dna-dependent rna polymerases for their production. mirnas are typically transcribed by pol ii whereas hc-sirna sequences are transcribed by pol iv. the pol iv transcripts serve as templates for rdr <dig> to generate dsrnas that are processed by dcl <dig> into 24-nt hc-sirnas and then loaded onto ago4-containing complexes . the ago4-bound hc-sirnas are recruited by nascent pol v transcripts which then guide rna-directed dna methylation . along with this, pol iv and pol v have distinct roles in the rddm pathway, pol iv being required for transcription of precursor rnas from heterochromatic loci, and pol v transcripts being required for sirna targeting to the rddm-affected loci.

during the last years the number of plant mirnas registered in mirbase  has dramatically increased, this expansion being largely a benefit of the adoption of next-generation high-throughput sequencing technology. although the early criteria for mirna annotation based on expression and biogenesis still provide a broadly accepted standard for mirna annotation  <cit> , additional criteria were proposed to strengthen plant mirna annotations   <cit> . however, some released mirnas might still be incorrectly annotated and not assessed with sufficient stringent criteria prior to their addition to the database.

plant mirnas are known to play important roles in a wide range of developmental processes  <cit> . mirnas also regulate the mirna pathway itself  <cit> . there is also increasing evidence that the modulation of mirna levels plays an important role in reprogramming plant responses to abiotic stress, including drought, cold, salinity, and nutrient deficiency  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> acts as a developmental regulator in the reprogramming of root cells during cyst nematode infection  <cit> . new insight into mirna function was gained with the discovery that distinct mirnas target genes involved in plant immune responses to pathogen infection .

traditionally, studies on plant immunity focused on the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes. along with this, host-encoded receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns . this recognition elicits the pamp-triggered immunity , or basal disease resistance, a process in which regulation of immune-response genes occurs through the coordinated regulation of hormone signals  <cit> . some pathogens, in turn, deliver effector proteins into the host cell that interfere pti functions and allow successful infection. as another layer of defence, plants have developed the ability to recognize such microbial effectors by additional receptors  to activate the effector-triggered immunity . in this context, it is becoming apparent that small rnas can modulate host gene expression in both pti and eti . the important role of the arabidopsis mir <dig> in antibacterial resistance is well documented  <cit> . thus, infection with the bacterial pathogen p. syringae as well as treatment with the bacterial elicitor flagelin  induces mir <dig> accumulation which, in turn, silences the expression of the tir <dig>  auxin receptor. repression of auxin signaling then contributes to bacterial resistance  <cit> . mirnas that guide the cleavage of transcripts corresponding to r genes and trigger production of phased secondary sirnas have been characterized in solanaceae and leguminosae species in relation to antiviral and antibacterial resistance  <cit> . in rice, we recently described a mirna, mir <dig> that positively regulates resistance to infection by the rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae
 <cit> . indeed, together with the knowledge of pathogen-responsive genes , a better knowledge of srnas involved in plant immunity will contribute to delineate novel strategies to improve disease resistance in plants.

most studies on pathogen-regulated srnas have been conducted in arabidopsis plants infected with the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae, or treated with the flagelin-derived elicitor peptide flg <dig> from p. syringae
 <cit> . however, less is known about srnas that are regulated during infection with fungal pathogens in plants. to fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a microarray-based search to identify arabidopsis small rnas whose expression is affected by treatment with fungal elicitors. among the elicitor-regulated mirnas was mir <dig>  known to control ago <dig> homeostasis. both the precursor and mature mir <dig> were induced by elicitor treatment. consistent with this, the mir168a promoter is transcriptionally activated by fungal elicitors in transgenic arabidopsis plants harboring the prommir168a::gfp  fusion gene. using transgenic plants expressing a gfp-mir168* sensor construct, we further demonstrated that the elicitor-induced mir <dig> is active. microarray analysis also revealed elicitor responsiveness of a small rna currently annotated as mir <dig> in mirbase. the status of this sequence has been, however, questioned . using arabidopsis mutants impaired in small rna biogenesis and function, we show that production of this particular small rna depends on pol iv, dcl <dig> and rdr <dig> activities. based on these findings, we conclude that this small rna is a hc-sirna, and can no longer be considered a mirna. microarray experiments also revealed elicitor-responsiveness of mir <dig>  this mirna targeting the plant-specific methyltransferase involved in dna methylation . these findings further support a role for hc-sirnas, potentially acting in rddm processes, in the response of arabidopsis plants to fungal elicitors.

RESULTS
identification of small rnas that are responsive to fungal elicitors in arabidopsis
in this work, we examined alterations in the accumulation of arabidopsis small rnas in response to treatment with elicitors obtained from the fungus fusarium oxysporum
 <cit> . towards this end, we used a customized microarray containing  <dig> probes corresponding to  <dig> known mirnas ,  <dig> candidate mirnas selected from the literature  <cit>  and  <dig> small rna sequences derived from massively parallel signature sequencing  in arabidopsis  <cit> . probes for known mirnas from non-plant species  were also included in the microrray. the complete list of probes represented in the microarray is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

total rna was isolated from arabidopsis seedlings that had been treated with elicitors obtained from the fungus f. oxysporum, and mock-inoculated plants, at different times of treatment . three independent biological replicates were prepared for each time point and condition. samples harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 120 min of elicitor treatment were used for microarray experiments. elicitor-induced alterations in small rna accumulation we identified by determining the ratio of the hybridization signal intensities between treated and control plants.

among the small rnas interrogated in the microarray,  <dig> mirnas corresponding to  <dig> mirna families, and  <dig> predicted mirnas showed elicitor-responsiveness  at one or more time points of elicitor treatment . most of these differentially expressed mirnas showed a dynamic response to fungal elicitors. only mir <dig> maintained a constant trend  in its response to fungal elicitors during the entire period of treatment.table  <dig>

mirnas whose expression varies in at least one time point of elicitor treatment are listed  for each mirna is shown. three biological replicates and three technical replicates for each biological sample were analysed.



elicitor-regulated mirnas mainly target transcription factors involved in the control of developmental processes. for instance, mir <dig> is known to target squamosa promoter binding protein like  transcription factors. two members of the mir <dig> family, mir156a and mir156h, were found to be sequentially regulated by elicitors . among the group of elicitor-regulated mirnas were also mir165/ <dig> targeting the phabulosa and phavoluta transcription factors, mir <dig> targeting scarecrow-like , and mir <dig> targeting apetala <dig> transcription factors. moreover, several mirnas that regulate auxin homeostasis were identified among the set of elicitor-responsive mirnas. they were: mir <dig> targeting two auxin response factors  genes , mir <dig> and mir <dig> . this observation points to a possible mirna-mediated regulation of auxin signaling by fungal elicitors.

of interest, mir <dig> was found to be up-regulated by fungal elicitors at all the time points of elicitor treatment examined here. we also noticed a significant increase in mir <dig> accumulation  at 30 min of elicitor treatment. this particular mirna has been reported to target transcripts of chromomethylase  <dig>  encoding an enzyme involved in dna methylation and gene silencing  <cit> . microarray analysis also showed regulation by fungal elicitors of certain small rna sequences whose status as a mirna has been questioned .

next, the conservation of elicitor-responsive mirnas among different plant species, both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous species, was investigated. in addition to arabidopsis thaliana, medicago truncatula, glycine max, populus trichocarpa, and solanum tuberosum are the dicot species with the highest number of mirnas annotated in the mirbase registry. as for monocots, oryza sativa, zea mays, sorghum bicolour and brachypodium distachyon have the highest number of mirnas annotated in mirbase. in this work, conserved mirnas were designated as those having identical sequences with the mirna sequences annotated in mirbase for all the above mentioned plant species. based on the information available on mirbase, both conserved and non conserved mirnas were identified among the subset of elicitor-responsive mirnas .table  <dig>

the microarray analysis comparing control non treated and elicitor-treated tissues of arabidopsis plants also allowed us to examine the accumulation level of small rna sequences previously identified through mpss  <cit> . up to  <dig> of those small rna sequences showed alterations in their accumulation at one or another time point . as it was observed for mirnas, the response of these small rna sequences to elicitors was highly dynamic, their accumulation being up- and down-regulated during the period of elicitor treatment examined here. together, microarray analysis revealed an altered expression of a subset of srnas, including mirnas from arabidopsis, in response to treatment with fungal elicitors, which might be indicative of their possible involvement in the plant response to fungal infection.

based on the results obtained in microarray experiments, two small rna sequences were selected for further analysis, namely mir <dig> and the small rna sequence annotated as mir <dig> in mirbase. mir <dig> was considered of interest due to the important role that this particular mirna plays in controlling the mirna machinery, by regulating ago <dig> homeostasis. concerning mir <dig>  the status of this sequence as a mirna has been questioned. in this context, it was important to investigate whether the elicitor-regulated small rna sequence named as mir <dig> in mirbase is a true mirna from arabidopsis, or not.

mir168is transcriptionally activated in response to fungal elicitors in arabidopsis
microarray analysis revealed up-regulation of mir <dig> in response to elicitor treatment. this particular mirna directs cleavage of ago <dig> mrna, with ago <dig> being the core component of the risc complex involved in mirna functioning  <cit> . considering the important role of mir <dig> in controlling the mirna machinery, it was of interest to explore the elicitor-responsiveness of both partners, mir <dig> and ago <dig>  initially, stem-loop rt-qpcr analysis was used to examine mature mir <dig> accumulation in control and elicitor-treated plants at all time points of elicitor treatment . as it is shown in figure 1a, a marked increase in mir <dig> accumulation could be observed as early as 5 min after the onset of elicitor treatment. mir <dig> accumulation remained at higher levels in elicitor-treated plants compared to control plants up to 90 min of elicitor treatment. thus, results obtained by stem-loop rt-qpcr analysis were then consistent with those observed by microarray analysis, further supporting that mir <dig> is up-regulated by fungal elicitors. on the other hand, ago <dig> expression remained at lower level in elicitor treated tissues compared to control plants at all time points, although these differences gradually decreased during the period of elicitor treatment .figure  <dig>

collectively, microarray and quantitative pcr analyses revealed that the mature mir <dig> accumulates in response to fungal elicitors. moreover, the elicitor-induced up-regulation of mir <dig> might account for the observed reduction in ago <dig> transcripts in elicitor treated plants compared to control plants during the period of treatment here assayed.

next, we investigated the in vivo activity of mir <dig> in tissues  of control and elicitor-treated arabidopsis plants. despite the relevance of mir <dig> in controlling ago <dig> homeostasis, little attention has been paid to mir <dig> expression or activity in tissues of arabidopsis plants other than leaves. towards this end, a sensor gene was obtained in which the mir <dig> target sequence was inserted into the 3’-utr of the gfp reporter gene . transgenic plants harboring the mir <dig> sensor gene were generated. mir <dig> activity was inferred by monitoring gfp fluorescence in tissues of transgenic arabidopsis plants , and in response to treatment with fungal elicitors . transgenic plants expressing the gfp gene devoid of the mir <dig> target sequence were produced and used as controls. as expected, gfp fluorescence was visualized in roots and leaves of control gfp-arabidopsis plants .figure  <dig>

under control conditions, gfp expression was readily detectable in roots of gfp-mir168* plants whereas only some fluorescent spots were visualized in their leaves, mainly at the distal areas . then, we compared the gfp patterns in tissues of control and elicitor-treated gfp-mir168* arabidopsis plants. remarkably, treatment with fungal elicitors resulted in loss of gfp fluorescence in roots of gfp-mir168* plants suggesting mir <dig> activity in these tissues . by contrast, differences in gfp fluorescence pattern between control and elicitor-treated leaves of mir168-gfp plants were not evident . these findings support that elicitor treatment results in enhanced activity of mir <dig>  mainly in roots of arabidopsis plants. the elicitor-induced activity that occurs in roots of sensor plants might well reflect an increase in mature mir <dig> in these tissues, which would account for the higher level of mir <dig> accumulation that is observed in elicitor-treated plants compared to non treated plants by stem-loop rt-qpcr analysis .in arabidopsis, the mir <dig> family comprises two members with identical mature mirna sequences, mir168a and mir168b. however, neither microarray or stem-loop rt-qpcr analyses, nor the gfp sensor system, provide information on the expression of the individual members of this mirna family. to investigate the elicitor-responsiveness of each individual family member, we examined the expression of their corresponding precursors  by qrt-pcr. this study revealed an important increase on the accumulation of both mir <dig> precursors at 30 min of elicitor treatment which progressively returned to normal values . these findings support a transcriptional activation of the two mir <dig> family members, mir168a and mir168b, in response to treatment with fungal elicitors.figure  <dig>

it is generally assumed that most mir genes are transcribed by rna polymerase ii and that their upstream regulatory regions contain canonical regulatory elements, i.e. cis-elements that are known to regulate transcription of protein-coding genes  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that the mir168a promoter contains numerous abscisic acid-responsive elements . along with this, mature mir <dig> accumulated in response to abiotic stress and aba treatment in arabidopsis  <cit> .

in this work, we scanned the mir <dig> promoter region for the presence of known cis-elements related to biotic stress and defence-related hormones. the sequence upstream of the precursor structure for either pre-mir168a or pre-mir168b was extracted from the ncbi database and the transcription start site  was identified by using the transcription start site identification program for plants . cis-acting elements present in the  <dig> kb dna region upstream of the tss were searched using the place database   <cit> . interestingly, the mir168a and mir168b promoters were found to contain several pathogen-responsive cis-elements . among them, we identified the elicitor responsive element  as well as several w-boxes, including the wrky <dig> and w-boxnpr <dig> elements. the ere regulatory element has been shown to direct pathogen- and elicitor-responsive expression in many stress-related genes  <cit> . w-boxes are the binding sites for sa-induced wrky transcription factors that are also found in the promoter of the npr <dig>  gene, a key regulator of salicylic acid -mediated defence responses in arabidopsis  <cit> . the sebf binding site was also identified in the mir <dig> promoter. this regulatory element was initially characterized in the pathogen and elicitor inducible potato pathogenesis-related gene pr-10a gene, and later on in the promoter of several other defence-related genes, including pr genes. additional regulatory elements identified in the mir <dig> promoter are associated with defence-related hormones such as ethylene  and methyl jasmonic acid  . to note, several auxin-responsive elements , such as the auxin response factor  binding site and the small auxin-up rna  binding site are present in the mir <dig> promoter. furthermore, pobo analysis  allowed us to compare the frequency of each motif identified in the mir <dig> promoter with the frequency of the same motif in the promoter regions of all known genes from arabidopsis  <cit> . excluding the wboxnpr <dig>  all the pathogen-related cis-motifs were significantly enriched in the mir <dig> promoter relative to the arabidopsis background set  . the sure, lecp binding site and gare elements were also found to be significantly enriched in this promoter. thus, the observed elicitor-induced accumulation of mir <dig> is consistent with the presence of pathogen/elicitor responsive elements in the mir <dig> promoter.

to further explore the regulatory mechanism of mir <dig> in the elicitor response, a functional analysis of the mir <dig> promoter was performed, focusing on the mir168a promoter. for this, the mir168a promoter region was fused to the gfp gene and the resulting construct  was used to transform arabidopsis plants. as control, transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing the gfp gene under the control of the 35scamv were generated. as expected gfp fluorescence was observed in all tissues of 35scamv::gfp plants . gfp expression could not be detected in tissues of control non treated pmir168a::gfp plants . when comparing these results with those obtained in gfp-mir168* sensor plants also grown under control conditions  it is concluded that neither mir168a promoter activity nor mir <dig> activity occurs in non treated roots of gfp-mir168* plants). an apparent discrepancy occurs in leaves of non treated plants as mir <dig> activity , but not mir168a promoter activity , is observed in these tissues pointing to the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms controlling mir <dig> expression and functioning under normal conditions. in this respect, a transcriptional/translational interlocked feedback loop governing expression of the mir168/ago <dig> pair is well documented in arabidopsis. indeed, the level of ago <dig> mrna is regulated by both the mirna mir <dig> and by sirnas generated from the ago <dig> mrna after mir168-mediated cleavage  <cit> . clearly, further studies are needed to clarify this aspect.figure  <dig>

of interest, gfp was readily detectable in roots of pmir168a::gfp plants that have been treated with fungal elicitors  indicating mir <dig> promoter responsiveness to fungal elicitors, at least in this organ. this finding is consistent with results obtained in gfp-mir168* sensor plants, where the elicitor-induced mir <dig> accumulation resulted in loss of gfp fluorescence . the mir <dig> promoter was also found to be activated in elicitor-treated leaves of pmir168::gfp plants . thus, functional analysis of the mir168a promoter in transgenic arabidopsis plants confirmed its elicitor-responsiveness while revealing a strong activity of this promoter in roots.

collectively, results obtained by stem-loop rt-qpcr and mir <dig> precursor expression analyses, in combination with those obtained in gfp-mir168* sensor plants and pmir168::gfp plants, support that mir <dig> is transcriptionally activated by fungal elicitors to produce active mir <dig> in arabidopsis plants.

sirna <dig>  an elicitor-inducible hc-sirna from arabidopsis
the current release of mirbase contains a sequence annotated as mir <dig> with two entries, one in a. thaliana  and another in rice . this small rna sequence was detected by northern blot analysis in arabidopsis flowers  <cit> . however, the status of this sequence as a mirna has been questioned due to the lack of conservation in genomes other than arabidopsis and rice, its moderately poor precursor hairpin structure, and the lack of identified targets.

our microarray analysis revealed a significant increase in the accumulation of this particular small rna at 30 min of elicitor treatment . differences in the accumulation of this small rna sequence between elicitor-treated and control non treated tissues were also distinguished by small rna northern blot . intriguingly, northern blot analysis revealed that this small rna was  <dig> nucleotides in length, thus, longer than the annotated sequence in mirbase . to further investigate the nature of this small rna sequence, we monitored its accumulation in arabidopsis mutants impaired in small rna biogenesis.

initially, we examined mutants with defects in each dcl gene, namely dcl1- <dig> , dcl2- <dig>  dcl3- <dig>  and dcl4- <dig>  as well as mutants with defects in a rdr gene for which a function has been established, namely rdr1- <dig>  rdr2- <dig> and rdr6- <dig> mutants  <cit> . except for dcl1- <dig> , all the dcl and rdr mutants were in the col <dig> genetic background. the small rna under study was detected in wild-type plants of the two accessions, its level of accumulation being slightly lower in ler plants than in col <dig> plants . interestingly, the dcl <dig> mutation abolished the accumulation of this small rna, whereas there were no significant changes on its accumulation in dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  and dcl <dig> mutants  . as expected, accumulation of mir <dig>  a canonical mirna from arabidopsis, was reduced in the dcl <dig> mutant, but not in any of the other dcl mutants .figure  <dig>

as previously mentioned, rdr dependencies are characteristic of plant sirnas. when examining accumulation of the small rna in rdr mutants, its accumulation was found to be compromised in the rdr <dig> mutant, but not in the rdr <dig> and rdr <dig> mutants .

evidence exists that 24-nt hc-sirnas function in rna-directed dna methylation  in the chromatin silencing pathway. in this work we examined the accumulation of the 24-nt small rna in pol iv and pol v mutants. as previously mentioned, rddm requires the concerted action of pol iv and pol v, the pol iv being required for hc-sirna biogenesis , and pol v being responsible of targeting sirnas to loci controlled by rddm. pol iv and pol v each has a unique largest subunit  and share the second largest subunit   <cit> . as it is shown in figure 5b, production of the 24-nt small rna is compromised in the nrpd <dig> mutant , its accumulation being also significantly reduced in the nrpe <dig> mutant . together, results obtained in the analysis of dcl, rdr, and pol mutants were consistent with the interpretation that the 24-nt small rna under study is produced by the poliv/rdr2/dcl <dig> pathway, a typical feature of hc-sirnas. finally, hc-sirnas are known to function in association with ago <dig>  <cit> . as it is shown in figure 5b, accumulation of this small rna was clearly reduced in the ago4- <dig> mutant , this observation supporting that this small rna associates with ago <dig> 

as controls, we examined the accumulation of the 24 nt hc-sirna originating from 5s rdna  in the panel of arabidopsis mutants. previous studies demonstrated that production of sirna <dig> is pol iv- and pol v-dependent  <cit>  and that sirna <dig> accumulation is significantly reduced, or abolished, in dcl3- <dig> and rdr2- <dig> mutants  <cit> . consistent with previously reported results, sirna <dig> was reduced to undetectable levels in dcl <dig>  rdr <dig>  sirna <dig> production was also impaired in the nrpd <dig>  mutant, while showing an important reduction in the nrpe <dig> mutant  compared to wild type col <dig> plants . as expected, sirna <dig> accumulation was not affected in dcl1- <dig>  dcl2- <dig>  dcl4- <dig>  rdr1- <dig> and rdr6- <dig> mutants . thus, sirna <dig> and the sirna under study exhibit the same genetic requirements of their production, namely pol iv, rdr <dig> and dcl <dig> 

taken together, analysis of arabidopsis mutants affected in biogenesis and functioning of small rnas revealed that mutations in any of the genes in the pol iv/rdr2/dcl <dig> pathway affect the accumulation of this small rna species. this piece of evidence strongly supports that the 24-nt small rna investigated here is indeed a hc-sirna and not a mirna. this sequence may therefore be removed in subsequent data releases from mirbase. we have named this small rna sirna <dig> 

finally, we examined whether sirna <dig> occurs in plant species other than arabidopsis. for this, we examined its accumulation in several monocotyledonous , and dicotyledonous  species. as it is shown in figure 5c, sirna <dig> was found to accumulate at different levels in the various plant species examined here.

discussion
in this work, we identified a group of small rnas that are regulated by fungal elicitors pointing to a possible role for these particular srnas in pamp-triggered immunity in arabidopsis plants. an important number of the elicitor-regulated mirnas identified in this study are known to control the expression of transcription factors functioning in developmental regulation. this observation further supports a link between plant development and pathogen resistance in arabidopsis while providing evidence that these mirnas might be regulated by both developmental cues and biotic stress conditions. because mirnas provide quantitative regulation of target gene expression, rather than on-off regulations, the group of elicitor-regulated srnas identified in this work might contribute to fine-tune gene expression in reprogramming developmental programs, this process being part of the adaptive strategy of plants to pathogen infection.

among the set of elicitor-regulated mirnas here identified, there were several mirnas controlling genes involved in hormone signaling, namely auxin signaling. in addition to their role in plant development, auxins play an important role in hormone crosstalk during the plant’s stress response  <cit> . antagonism between auxin and sa, a major regulator of plant defences, has long been demonstrated  <cit> . auxins are also known to regulate the expression of plant defence genes  <cit> . in other studies, repression of the auxin response pathway was found to increase arabidopsis susceptibility to necrotrophic fungi  <cit> . the repression of auxin signaling in arabidopsis enhances resistance to bacterial infection in arabidopsis, a process that is mediated by mir <dig>  <cit> . under this scenario, it can be postulated that recognition of fungal elicitors would trigger alterations in the expression of distinct mirnas which are responsible of reprogramming host developmental processes, including auxin-regulated processes. this perturbation, in turn, might contribute to regulation of defence responses either directly or indirectly through cross-talk between auxin and defence-related hormones.

in our microarray analysis, however, no changes were observed in the expression of the bacteria-responsive mir <dig> and mir <dig>  also known to control genes involved in auxin signaling pathway. this observation might be indicative of a differential regulation of these mirnas during infection by either fungal pathogens or bacterial pathogens. alternatively, the expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  might be regulated at time points of elicitor treatment not assayed in this work. clearly, regulation of multiple mirnas exhibiting regulatory links with auxin signaling during pti responses might provide a fine tune regulation of gene expression in controlling resistance to different types of plant pathogens.

on the other hand, our study revealed that mir <dig>  a mirna that is deeply conserved among plant species, is transcriptionally regulated by fungal elicitors. several lines of evidence support this conclusion. firstly, we demonstrated that mature mir <dig> rapidly accumulates in response to elicitor treatment. secondly, expression of mir <dig> precursors is also up-regulated upon elicitor treatment. thirdly, functional analysis of the mir168a promoter in transgenic arabidopsis further supports that mir <dig> is regulated at the transcriptional level. the observed transcriptional activation of mir <dig> is consistent with the presence of various pathogen- and elicitor-responsive cis-elements in the mir <dig> promoter. finally, by using gfp-mir168* sensor plants we demonstrated that the elicitor-induced mir <dig> is active.

it is well established that mir <dig> plays a critical role in mirna functioning by controlling ago <dig> homeostasis. thus, ago <dig> homeostasis entails coexpression of mir <dig> and ago <dig> and preferential stabilization of mir <dig> by ago <dig>  <cit>  .in this work, we show that the elicitor-induced accumulation of mir <dig> leads to a consistent decline on the accumulation of ago <dig> transcripts in elicitor-treated tissues relative to control tissues . on the basis of these data, we can hypothesize that a transcriptional regulation of mir <dig> might be responsible for the control of ago <dig> accumulation early during elicitor treatment. if so, the transcriptional regulation of mir <dig> would represent another layer of control of the refined regulatory system that controls mir <dig> levels and ago <dig> levels. presumably, an elicitor-regulated adjustment of mir <dig> levels might contribute to the maintenance of the appropriate levels of ago <dig>  and accordingly of mirna functioning, during the plant defense response to pathogen infection.

in the literature there are several reports on the involvement of ago <dig> in plant antiviral defense  <cit> . ago <dig> also contribute to flg22-induced disease resistance in arabidopsis plants  <cit> . very recently, shen et al.  <cit>  described a decrease in mir <dig> accumulation with a simultaneous increase in ago <dig> transcript abundance in roots of oilseed rape  infected with the soil-borne pathogenic fungus verticillium longisporum . furthermore, weiberg et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that some small rnas from botrytis cinerea hijack the host rnai machinery by binding to ago <dig> and selectively silencing host immunity responses. together, these pieces of evidence strongly support that mir168/ago <dig> modulation might play an important role in shaping host responses to pathogen infection, including infection by fungal pathogens. in other studies, mir <dig> was reported to be induced by abiotic stresses   <cit> . then, it is noteworthy that mir <dig> is regulated by both biotic and abiotic stress conditions, these findings highlighting the importance of mirna functioning in plant adaptive processes to environmental stress. clearly, a fine-tuned adjustment of mir <dig> and ago <dig> levels would provide a flexible system for the control of processes that are critical to ensure plant survival under adverse environmental conditions.

on the other hand, our microarray analysis of arabidopsis small rnas allowed us to identify a small rna  that transiently accumulates in response to fungal elicitors. most importantly, analysis of mutants impaired in the small rna biogenesis pathways revealed that production of this 24-nt sirna is dependent on the dcl3/rdr2/pol iv pathway, its accumulation being also reduced by mutations in pol v and ago <dig>  as previously mentioned, biogenesis of hc-sirnas begins with the transcription by rna pol iv, which is then followed by rdr2-catalyzed synthesis of dsrna. then, si-rnas  are processed from the dsrnas by dcl <dig>  and loaded into ago4-containing riscs. besides, the function of the ago4-assembled hc-sirnas requires the production of a scaffold transcript by pol v which recruits the ago4-bound hc-sirnas. based on the results obtained in this work, it is concluded that sirna <dig> is a bona fide hc-sirna that is dependent on pol iv/rdr2/dcl3/ago <dig> for its biogenesis and function. this small rna sequence was incorrectly annotated as a mirna and, accordingly, this entry may be removed from future database releases.

in plants, hc-sirnas are involved in transcriptional gene silencing by guiding dna methylation at target genomic loci through rna-directed dna methylation   <cit> . a major function of hc-sirnas is to maintain genome integrity by silencing transposable elements  <cit> . some reports indicate that hc-sirnas also control the expression of protein-coding genes   <cit> . there is then the possibility that sirna <dig> might guide dna methylation at still unknown genomic loci. further studies are needed to assess whether sirna <dig> guides methylation in arabidopsis plants. finally, as this small rna was identified in plant species other than arabidopsis, both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species, there is also the possibility that functioning of this small rna is not restricted to arabidopsis.

the scaffolding model for the function of ago4-associated hc-sirnas in rddm implies recruiting dna methyltransferase enzymes by transcripts being transcribed by pol v. in this context, dna methylation in rddm is maintained by the overlapping functions of methyltransferase  <dig>  and cmt <dig> in arabidopsis. of interest, microarray analysis revealed elicitor-regulation of mir <dig>  this particular mirna targeting cmt <dig> transcripts. the cmt <dig> gene encodes chromomethylase <dig>  a protein involved in rddm. the finding that mir <dig> is affected by fungal elicitors raises interesting questions concerning the mechanisms by which this particular mirna might exert its regulatory role in plant immunity by controlling cmt <dig> expression and rddm.

concerning the involvement of rddm in mediating regulation of plant immune responses, this issue has only recently come to light  <cit> . recent reports have shown that dna methylation is part of the arabidopsis immune response, i.e. by priming transcriptional activation of some defence genes during antibacterial resistance  <cit> . a model was proposed to explain regulation of a. thaliana immune system by dna demethylation whereby dna methylation imparts persistent control over some defence genes during non stressful conditions, but can change dynamically to alter gene expression in response to biotic stress  <cit> . the contribution of components of the rddm pathway, such as ago <dig> and rna pol v, in plant immunity is also documented  <cit> . because rddm can be rapidly reversed by biotic stress, it was proposed that dampening defence gene expression through active rddm would provide an effective mode of regulation of host defense responses in plants  <cit> .

in summary, results here presented will help in understanding the contribution of small rnas, both mirnas and sirnas, in the arabidopsis response to pathogen infection while providing new opportunities to elucidate the molecular events controlling plant disease resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study microarray analysis was used to identify small rnas, mirnas and sirnas whose accumulation is regulated by treatment with fungal elicitors in arabidopsis. among the elicitor-regulated mirnas was mir <dig>  this mirna controlling the level of ago <dig> transcripts. we demonstrated that mir <dig> is transcriptionally regulated by fungal elicitors. these finding suggest that mir <dig> contributes to the maintenance of the appropriate levels of ago <dig>  and hence mirna functioning, in the response of arabidopsis plants to fungal elicitors. additionally, we identified an elicitor-regulated hc-sirna  which was incorrectly annotated as a mirna. these results, toghether with the observation that mir <dig>  further support a function of rna-directed dna methylation processes in mediating plant immune responses. this work represents an effort to identify relevant small rnas regulating the arabidopsis response to pathogens that may have relevance to study other pathosystems.
