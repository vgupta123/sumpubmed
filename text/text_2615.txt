BACKGROUND
the honey bee, apis mellifera, occupies a prominent place in biological research due to its social behavior, learning capabilities, haplodiploid mechanism of sex determination, and plasticity in phenotype  and longevity. thus, it is a model organism for classical and sociogenetic studies. in addition, bees drive a large-scale apicultural industry, and also generate important income in small-scale subsistence beekeeping. and finally, bees are of great economic and ecological relevance for their role as generalist pollinators.

the decision to include the honey bee amongst the current organisms for complete genome sequencing,  was, therefore, well founded, yet information on its transcriptome is still meager. when starting this study, little over  <dig> genes were annotated as partial or full length coding sequences, and only about  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  were available in public databases. thus, even after sequencing of the honey bee genome will be completed a considerable transcriptome sequencing effort will still be required for unequivocal genome annotation, gene identification, and subsequent functional studies.

we used the orestes  strategy to generate ests from different life cycle stages of the honey bee, such as appropriate for a genome annotation initiative. this strategy preferentially generates ests of the central, and thus most informative portion of the transcript  <cit> , and frequently also identifies less abundant mrnas  <cit> . the efficacy of the open reading frame ests strategy, in the context of an organism for which there is limited genomic information, has recently been demonstrated for schistosoma mansoni  <cit> .

this cost-efficient approach increased the already existent apis est database by 30% new reads. of the  <dig>  orestes, only  <dig> % matched with previously deposited apis ests. when assembled with the existent apis ests in the ncbi database, the orestes sequences extended 66% of the mixed contigs. together these data indicate that the orestes methodology could effectively complement the current efforts towards the definition of the apis transcriptome.

RESULTS
honey bee open reading frame ests
we generated a total of  <dig> mini-libraries from the four major life cycle stages of honey bee workers  by the use of arbitrary primers and a low-stringency rt-pcr protocol  <cit> . from these libraries we obtained  <dig>  sequences of appropriate standard quality  and with an average size of  <dig>  bp. these sequences were deposited in the genbank est database . in the annotation pipeline, these were first submitted to blastn searches against apis mellifera sequences deposited in the ncbi est database . at this step,  <dig> %  of the validated sequences matched apis ests . in a subsequent step, a blastx comparison of the remaining sequences against the nr-ncbi database permitted the annotation of an additional  <dig> %  of the honey bee orestes, while the remaining  <dig> %  did not match any known sequence. this rather large set of ests that did not result in significant alignment with any sequence deposited in non-redundant databases contains candidates for novel honey bee genes.

ablastn against dbest using an e-score of 10- <dig> as cutoff value; bblastx against the nr database used <10- <dig> as the cutoff. *this set is also represented by ests in the dbest database. it is included here as additional information only and is not to be summed up with the other matches.

the  <dig>  apis orestes were assembled by cap <dig> into  <dig> contigs of a mean size of  <dig> bp, leaving  <dig> singlets. in a second round of blastx comparisons against the nr-ncbi database,  <dig> % of the contigs and  <dig> % of the singlets were classified as putative orthologs. when the respective best matches were classified according to species or higher order taxa ,  <dig> % were from the arthropod clade . the largest fraction of these putative orthologs showed best matches with predicted anopheles genes , followed by orestes that were classified as putative orthologs of drosophila .

gene ontology classification
we assigned level  <dig> gene ontology  classifications to  <dig> of the total of  <dig> assembled contigs;  <dig> contigs did not match any sequence in the nr-protein database. in the manual annotation preceding the go analysis we preferentially assigned the contigs with respect to their drosophila orthologs. the cellular component, biological process, and molecular function classifications of the honey bee sequences are shown in table  <dig>  in the biological process categories there is a clear prevalence for ests representing cell communication, cell growth and maintenance, metabolism and morphogenesis. for molecular function, the dominant assignments were to enzymatic activity and to nucleic acid binding and related functions . when compared to the corresponding go results obtained for the bee brain ests  <cit> , we noted a similar distribution in category dominance structure, except for the molecular functions 'transporter and ligand binding/carrier' which have a higher representation in the bee brain ests than in our orestes contigs. this discrepancy most probably reflects functional differences in the tissues used in these two studies.

go levels were set at  <dig>  in either of the go categories, individual contigs may be listed in more than one category. this go classification only includes apis mellifera orthologs to drosophila genes that are represented by a flybase code.

clustering of honey bee ests
we clustered the contigs generated in this study  with the apis mellifera ests already present in the ncbi dbest database . clustering performed by cap <dig> resulted in a total of  <dig>  contigs and led to a general increase in read depth . this increase in read depth is reflected in the cap <dig> assembled mixed sequences of the two databases. mean length is  <dig> bp for the amncbi contigs and  <dig> bp for the amorestes contigs . for the mixed contigs we noted a mean increase of about  <dig> bp in contig length, thus documenting that the orestes sequences add considerable information to the characterization of the honey bee transcriptome and for subsequent studies of specific genes.

within the total contig population,  <dig> % of the assembled sequences  are represented by mixed contigs of both amorestes and amncbi sequences, and within this group  <dig> %  of the original amncbi contigs were considerably extended, or were joined across gaps by the amorestes contigs, as illustrated in figure 2c. the fact that the number of mixed contigs is relatively low compared to total contig number may be attributed to two aspects. first, most of the amncbi contigs were obtained from a single tissue  library, whereas the amorestes sequences represent whole body transcripts of all life cycle stages of the honey bee. second, the amncbi sequences are mainly 5'-ests, whereas the amorestes sequences are expected to cover more central cdna regions.

genome comparison
even though the total number of ests available for apis mellifera is still low when compared to established genomic model organisms, we performed an across genome analysis with the set of  <dig>  honey bee contigs. this involved sequential blastx searches, using the honey bee sequences as query entries against protein databases of drosophila melanogaster, anopheles gambiae, caenorhabditis elegans, human, protozoan and fungal origin. with this selection of organisms we intended to extract information on the percentage of genes that apis shares  with all organisms,  with animals,  with different sets of metazoans,  and exclusively with insects. the cutoff e-value in these comparisons was set at 10- <dig>  as used in comparisons of similar nature  <cit> , and the representation of the respective putative orthologs was listed across taxonomic levels.

we found that  <dig>  apis contigs presented significant match with sequences belonging to at least one of the taxa genomes. from these,  <dig> contigs  correspond to genes with a representation in all the above taxa . in addition, further  <dig> contigs  could also be classified as common to all organisms since they were represented in all but in one of the members of this set of taxa . this increases the set of est contigs that the honey bee may share with all organisms to  <dig> %, or, when considering the entire set of  <dig>  contigs, to  <dig> %. the second largest set of ests  is the one that is represented as genes common to the bilaterian clade , and only the third largest set  contains genes that are represented solely in hymenopterans and dipterans, and thus in the insect clade.

since deep-level phylogeny relationships within the bilateria are still a matter of debate, we separated our dataset according to the two prevalent hypotheses. the traditional view clusters arthropods within the coelomate clade. in our set of genomes, this tree architecture would be represented by genes shared between insects and the human genome. the alternative, more recently proposed hypothesis joins arthropods with nematodes to form an ecdysozoan clade  <cit> . the result of our comparison, which places emphasis on shared genes and not on the frequency of gene losses, is more consistent with the traditional view, since the coelomate clade is represented in this analysis with almost five times more shared genes than the ecdysozoan clade.

to infer on functional aspects within this pattern of genes that different clades appear to have in common we performed a gene ontology classification on biological process. in the set of apis ests that stands for genes putatively shared with all organisms, the majority was classified as having a role in metabolism, and thus can be considered to represent basic functions. in contrast, the majority of apis ests that are shared within the insect clade was represented in the biological process categories of cell growth and/or maintenance and cell communication. the corresponding insect-specific genes are therefore supposedly involved in more specialized functions. a similar conclusion can be reached from the micro- and macroarray analyses of transcripts detected in adult honey bee workers performing different tasks during their adult life cycle  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> putative ortholog ests did not comply with any of the plausible phylogenies, yet nevertheless, this set may contain ests of interesting information content, especially when considering that the main set of genes within this group consists of apis mellifera contigs that overlap with a mammalian genome. a manual analysis of these  <dig> contigs by blastx against the nr-ncbi database revealed that they are  more similar to mammals  than to other vertebrates and even other insects. this suggests that these genes may have diverged less in apis and mammals and, therefore, may be subject to related selection pressure. alternatively, at least some of them may have been modified in diptera, and thus would show up as insect genes only once further non-dipteran insect genomes or transcriptomes have been sequenced and annotated. as shown in table  <dig>  this set of bee/human contigs contains a considerable number of predicted proteins related to cell signaling/signal transduction and transcription factors. such a bias to information processing in our dataset of genes shared between honey bees and a mammalian genome may reveal system properties related to complex functions.

finally, we found that  <dig>   of the assembled est contigs did not match with any sequence of the analyzed organisms. such a large proportion of apis-specific contigs is likely to be an overestimate. as noted in a previous study  <cit> , this might be partly due to technical problems, such as, sequencing of cdna inserts consisting mainly of 3'-untranslated regions, the presence of unspliced intron sequences, cdnas with a negative reading frame, or chimaeric cdnas. however, the major portion of the apis-specific contigs may have become classified as species-specific due to their relatively short orfs. we performed an estscan analysis  on the apis-specific contigs which detected orfs in 56% of the assembled ests. these orfs are, however, relatively short, with a mean orf length around  <dig> bp. short orf length represents a notorious problem to alignment algorithms resulting in low match scores, and consequently, a more frequent classification of short orf ests as species-specific transcripts. for the honey bee, this has been shown for the brain cdna library where 84% of the ests with orfs shorter than  <dig> bp were classified as species-specific, against 24% in the est set that had orfs larger than  <dig> bp  <cit> .

in order to gain a general perspective on the representation of species-specific ests we also directed our attention to estimates obtained in whole-genome cross-species analyses. for instance, a figure of  <dig> % of species-specific genes was ascertained for drosophila melanogaster in a genome comparison which included anopheles gambiae as the other insect representative  <cit> . based on this information, and taking advantage of a set of drosophila melanogaster orestes, generated in a parallel project, we calculated the frequency of drosophila-specific orestes sequences to obtain a more realistic estimate on apis-specific genes in relatively small sets of ests. in this analysis, a set of  <dig>  cap <dig> assembled drosophila orestes  was submitted to sequential blastx searches against protein databases of drosophila melanogaster, anopheles gambiae, caenorhabditis elegans, human, protozoan and fungal, as described for the apis contigs. for comparison, this same analysis was also performed with apis ests, using separately  <dig>  amorestes  and  <dig>  amncb .

the drosophila and apis est contigs consistently showed relatively low proportions of insect-specific genes . still lower  was the proportion of ests that had significantly higher similarity scores with eukaryotes other than insecta. in all est sets we found a large fraction of sequences that were classified as either drosophila-specific  or apis-specific . this high proportion of species-specific genes, therefore appears to be generated independent of the method used in est sequencing, as it is represented in similar proportions in both the orestes set and the conventional 5'-est set .

the figure of 40% drosophila-specific genes obtained for our drosophila orestes set can be directly set in contrast with the estimate of  <dig> % species-specific genes reported in the drosophila genome based study  <cit> , and this would predict an overestimate factor of  <dig>  for species-specific genes in the est sets. when this factor is applied to the honey bee orestes, the 47% estimate for species-specific amorestes can thus be corrected to a more realistic figure of 22%. this estimate is in agreement with the results of whitfield et al.  <cit>  who observed that 24% of the honey bee genes represented by ests with orfs larger than  <dig> bp did not have matches to any known protein sequences. this apis-specific gene estimate is also in range when considering that the two dipteran species are thought to have separated from a common ancestor approximately  <dig> million years ago, whereas the postulated sister-group relationship of hymenoptera and mecopteroidea  <cit>  suggests a pre-permian divergence, with a predicted separate lineage evolution of over  <dig> million years for honey bees and dipterans  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the generation of a relative small set of open reading frame ests  that match and complement the already existent apis est database shows that this approach is sufficiently robust and favorably complements other strategies, such as ests prepared from normalized cdna libraries. its inherent properties of detecting transcripts of low abundance and aligning with central regions of transcripts  <cit>  also make it a suitable tool in searches for novel honey bee genes and their annotation in parallel with ongoing genome sequencing projects. furthermore, the genome comparisons performed in this and other studies  <cit>  highlight that the elevated number of putative apis-specific genes will still require extensive transcriptome sequencing for high quality genome annotation, and will play an important role in the question of insect genome organization and model systems in comparative studies  <cit> .
