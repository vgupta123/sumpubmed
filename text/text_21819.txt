BACKGROUND
tight junctions comprise the most apical of the junctional structures in epithelial cells and form a diffusion barrier allowing for the regulated movement of ions and solutes through the paracellular pathway  <cit> . paracellular transport is driven by concentration gradients and is size- and ion-selective; however, the molecular mechanisms that permit selective paracellular diffusion are only partially understood. tight junctions also participate in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity and in various signalling pathways controlling gene expression, cell differentiation and proliferation. their ability to perform such an array of functions is largely attributable to the diverse protein complement from which they are composed.

there are two main classes of transmembrane proteins found at the tight junction: the four- and the single-span transmembrane proteins  <cit> . while both classes have been implicated in the adhesive properties of the tight junction, only the four-pass transmembrane proteins â€“ namely claudins, occludin and tricellulin â€“ have so far been directly linked to the barrier properties of the junction. the single-span proteins  as well as bves, a protein with three transmembrane domains, serve different types of regulatory and signalling functions during differentiation, junction assembly, and transmigration of leukocytes  <cit> .

claudins are believed to be the main structural component of the tight junction strands  <cit> . they are thought to form regulated aqueous pores or channels that enable the passive diffusion of charged molecules through the paracellular space  <cit> . claudin expression and activity are hence thought to be major determinants of paracellular ion conductance. as altered expression of various claudins has been linked to carcinogenesis and cell migration, claudins may also modulate subcellular signalling mechanisms and possess non-junctional functions in the regulation of integrin function  <cit> .

a distinct group of tight junction-associated proteins is represented by occludin and tricellulin, both also components of intramembrane strands  <cit> . based on functional studies in tissue culture cell lines, animal models, as well as inherited human diseases, it seems that occludin and tricellulin possess regulatory roles in junction function, and, at least in the case of occludin, participate in signalling pathways regulated by tight junctions  <cit> . whereas experiments with tissue culture cells suggest that tricellulin directly contributes to the junctional structure, no such evidence has been reported for occludin  <cit> . nevertheless, it has recently been demonstrated that occludin depletion results in a redistribution of tricellulin, suggesting that the latter protein may be able to compensate for some functions of the former in occludin knockdown cells  <cit> . it is thus important to determine whether there are other members of the occludin family at tight junctions.

the four transmembrane helix architecture of both occludin and tricellulin represents a marvel domain   <cit> . while the prevalence and significance of the marvel domain is not yet clear, its identification in proteins of the mal, physin, gyrin and occludin families has lead to putative roles in cholesterol-rich membrane apposition and fusion events to be proposed. whether all marvel domain proteins are indeed associated in such membrane apposition events, however, is not clear. the bioinformatics analysis by sanchez-pulido and colleagues not only identified marvel domain-containing proteins of known functions, but also proteins that had previously not been analysed such as marvel domain-containing protein  <dig>  which was later named tricellulin, and marvel domain-containing protein  <dig> , a protein that has not yet been studied  <cit> .

in this study, we identify marveld <dig>  a four-pass transmembrane protein of about  <dig> kda, as a novel integral membrane component of the epithelial cell tight junctions. marveld <dig> co-localises with the tight junction protein occludin but not with the adherens junction marker e-cadherin. functional analysis suggests that depletion of marveld <dig> does not interfere with the formation of functional tight junctions but results in increased transepithelial electrical resistance , suggesting that marveld <dig> is a determinant of paracellular ion permeability.

RESULTS
expression of marveld <dig> in epithelial and endothelial cells
bioinformatics analysis revealed the existence of two human marveld <dig> isoforms: isoform  <dig> contains  <dig> amino acids  and isoform  <dig>  <dig> amino acids  . a membrane topology analysis with phobius http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/phobius/ and tmpred http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/tmpred_form.html confirmed that both isoforms are predicted to contain four transmembrane domains and to expose their n- and c-terminal domains to the cytosol. the two isoforms represent splice variants and share the predicted n-terminal cytoplasmic domain of  <dig> amino acids, but differ in their c-terminal halves that contain the transmembrane domains. both marveld <dig> isoforms are predicted to possess only short c-terminal cytoplasmic domains  with no apparent similarities to the comparatively long cytoplasmic domains of tricellulin and occludin that contain their zo- <dig> binding sites  <cit> .

database searches revealed that marveld <dig> is expressed in chicken, xenopus and various mammalian species, but not in any invertebrates, suggesting that it is expressed by vertebrates only . alternatively spliced isoforms were only found in mammalian species. in contrast, the chicken genome contains two distinct marveld <dig> genes, variant a and b, that reside on different chromosomes. variant a is more similar to mammalian isoform  <dig>  although variant b is more similar to isoform  <dig> than  <dig>  the two chicken proteins show a similar degree of conservation with mammalian isoform  <dig>  it thus seems that mammalian isoform  <dig> and the variant a gene found in birds, fish and amphibians represent the marveld <dig> form common to all vertebrates.

marveld <dig> sequences were retrieved from genbank and aligned using clustalw . indicated are all genbank accession numbers. the scores reflect percent identity. for mammals, the two alternatively spliced isoforms were used. two different marveld <dig> genes, variants a and b, exist in chicken. only variant a was found in x. laevis and zebrafish.

we first generated an antibody against a peptide of the n-terminal cytoplasmic domain to analyse marveld <dig> expression. expression was analysed in two epithelial cell lines derived from different types of epithelia: caco- <dig>  a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, and an immortalised human corneal epithelial cell line   <cit> . total cell extracts were generated from control cells as well as cells transfected with control sirnas or a pool of four sirnas targeting marveld <dig>  all four targeted sequences are part of the common exon encoding the n-terminal cytoplasmic domain; hence, mrnas encoding both isoforms should become degraded.

fig. 2a shows that the antibody recognised a band of about  <dig> kd in both cell lines as expected. the band became weaker with increasing concentrations of marveld <dig> sirna, indicating that the band indeed corresponded to marveld <dig>  deconvolution of the marveld <dig> sirna pool revealed that sirnas  <dig> and  <dig> were the most effective of the four sequences and were hence used for the subsequent functional analysis . transfection of cdnas encoding the two isoforms resulted in strong bands of the same molecular weight in immunoblots with the anti-marveld <dig> antibody, further supporting its specificity . further immunoblotting experiments revealed marveld <dig> protein expression in additional cell lines derived from prostate and mammary gland . these observations indicate that marveld <dig> is expressed in different epithelial cell types.

the marveld <dig> antibody was found to recognise only human marveld <dig> and recognises both isoforms; hence, we used reverse transcription pcr to determine expression of marveld <dig> isoforms in different cultured epithelial and endothelial cell lines, as well as different tissues. fig. 3a shows that both isoforms are widely expressed by different epithelial and endothelial cells. similarly, most tested adult mouse tissues expressed both isoforms . both marveld <dig> isoforms are thus widely expressed and are found in different types of epithelial and endothelial cells. nevertheless, apparent differences in isoform expression profiles were detected as, for example, both liver and the hepatocyte-derived cell line hepg <dig> only expressed isoform  <dig> 

localisation of marveld3
we next used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the localisation of marveld <dig> in epithelial cells. as our antibody only recognises the human protein, we used caco- <dig> and hce cells for the localisation experiments as they form well-developed junctional complexes and are derived from two different types of epithelia. confluent cultures of the two cell lines were fixed and processed for double immunofluorescence using the rabbit anti-marveld <dig> antibody and a mouse monoclonal antibody against occludin. the samples were first analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy.

fig.  <dig> shows that the anti-marveld <dig> antibody stained cell-cell contacts in caco- <dig>  and hce  cells. there was also some cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. however, the junctional staining was specific as it disappeared when marveld <dig> was depleted by rna interference . in both cell lines, marveld <dig> and occludin co-localised, suggesting that marveld <dig> is a component of the apical junctional complex.

we next transfected cdnas encoding the two isoforms into caco- <dig> and mdck cells to confirm the localisation observed for the endogenous protein. fig. 4c shows that both isoforms were enriched at cell-cell contacts, supporting the staining observed for endogenous protein in panel a. control mdck cells did not reveal any staining for marveld <dig>  possibly due to the species difference as the antibody was made against a sequence of the human protein that shows little conservation in the canine protein. expression of n-terminally ha-tagged marveld <dig> isoforms in caco- <dig> cells also resulted in staining of cell-cell contacts with anti-ha and anti-marveld <dig> antibodies . these data indicate that both isoforms of marveld <dig> localise to cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells.

we next used confocal microscopy to analyse the expression of marveld <dig> in more detail. fig. 5a and 5b show that marveld <dig> and occludin co-localised at cell junctions in caco- <dig>  and hce cells  and in the same focal plane . in contrast, marveld <dig> and the adherens junction marker e-cadherin localised in different focal planes . the concentration of marveld <dig> at the apical end of the lateral membrane together with occludin, apical to the lateral e-cadherin staining, was also observed in z-projections reconstituted from serial z line scans . these data thus demonstrate that marveld <dig> co-localises with occludin, but not e-cadherin, at the junctional complex, indicating specific association with tight junctions.

functional characterisation of marveld <dig> at the tight junction
to begin to address a functional role of marveld <dig> at the tight junction, we used sirna to deplete marveld <dig> and looked for the effects this had on the localisation and expression levels of other protein constituents of the apical junctional complex. efficient knockdown of marveld <dig> was achieved with a pool of sirnas as well as the two individual sirnas identified above . depletion of marveld <dig> on immunoblots was mirrored by the absence of junctional staining by immunofluorescence , indicating that knockdown of marveld <dig> was sufficient to efficiently deplete the junctional pools of marveld <dig> 

we next tested whether depletion of marveld <dig> affected expression levels of other junctional proteins. expression of the tight junction proteins occludin, claudin- <dig>  gef-h <dig>  zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and zo- <dig>  and the adherens junction proteins e-cadherin and β-catenin remained unchanged . we were not able to detect tricellulin using an available commercial antibody. similarly, immunofluorescence analysis did not reveal any effects of marveld <dig> depletion on the distribution of other junctional proteins . although we cannot exclude minor alterations based on these data, depletion of marveld <dig> does not seem to affect the overall distribution of major junctional components.

an important function of tight junctions is the generation of a tight seal between neighbouring cells of the monolayer, which restricts the movement of ions and solutes through the paracellular pathway  <cit> . to determine whether or not marveld <dig> plays a role in the assembly of the barrier or in the regulation of ion permeability, we compared the ter of monolayers formed by control caco- <dig> cells with those formed by caco- <dig> cells depleted of marveld <dig>  to follow assembly and monolayer formation of the junction, cells were seeded first on plastic for transfection of the sirna.  <dig> hours after transfection, the cells were re-plated onto permeable supports either in normal tissue culture medium  or at low ca2+ concentrations, which are insufficient to support junction formation. junction assembly was then initiated  <dig> hours after plating by switching the cells to normal ca2+ concentrations   <cit> , by which time depletion had already occurred. the monolayers were followed for a further  <dig> hours by measuring ter and then analysed for protein expression and paracellular tracer permeability.

fig. 7a shows that marveld <dig> was still efficiently depleted at the end of the incubation period. similarly, no effects on monolayer morphology and localisation of junctional proteins were observed . ter measurements revealed that formation of functional tight junctions still occurred at similar kinetics as in control cells . however, marveld <dig> depleted cells reached higher resistance values. determination of tracer permeability using  <dig> kd and  <dig> kd fluorescent dextrans did not suggest any defects in barrier formation or significant alterations in tracer diffusion . cells that were directly plated in normal medium, and were hence  <dig> hours longer in normal ca2+ medium, also formed functional tight junctions and reached stable ter values by the end of the incubation time . as the ca2+switch cells, directly plated marveld <dig> depleted cells had reached 25% higher electrical resistance values than control cells.

taken together, these results indicate that marveld <dig> depletion does not affect the formation of functional tight junctions, but that marveld <dig> levels are a determinant of paracellular ion conductivity.

discussion
in this study, we have shown that marveld <dig>  a four-pass transmembrane protein, co-localises with the tight junction protein occludin, apical to the adherens junction protein e-cadherin, indicating that marveld <dig> is a third tight junction-associated marvel domain protein. a functional analysis using rna interference-mediated depletion indicates that marveld <dig> is not essential for junction assembly and the formation of a functional paracellular diffusion barrier, but the observed increase in ter in depleted cells indicates that marveld <dig> is a determinant of paracellular ion permeability.

our data demonstrate that marveld <dig> associates with the junctional complex of intestinal and corneal epithelial cells, and its expression was detected in multiple mouse tissues and cultured epithelial and endothelial cell lines. marveld <dig> thus seems to be a widely expressed protein and hence likely to be a component of tight junctions with different functional properties.

marveld <dig> is expressed as two isoforms and both were recruited to the cell periphery in transfected cells in a manner similar to the endogenous protein, suggesting that both isoforms associate with junctions. our attempts to generate isoform-specific antibodies, which are required to study endogenously expressed isoforms at the protein level, have so far failed. based on reverse transcription pcr results, however, both isoforms seem to be widely expressed. an aim of future studies will be to differentiate between marveld <dig> isoforms at the protein level and to determine whether there are any isoform-specific differences in expression, localisation and/or function, as has been suggested for occludin  <cit> .

occludin and tricellulin not only localise to tight junctions, but have been shown to associate with the junctional intramembrane strands observed in freeze fracture replicas  <cit> . it will thus be important to determine whether marveld <dig> also associates with these structures and whether the marvel domain, which is found in all three proteins, is important for strand association  <cit> . the marvel domain is found in proteins such as mal that are thought to associate with cholesterol-rich microdomains in cell membranes  <cit> . as occludin has previously also been shown to associate with cholesterol-rich microdomains  <cit> , it is possible that marvel domain proteins affect tight junctions via such membrane microdomains. at present, however, the precise role of cholesterol in tight junctions is not clear  <cit> .

given the membrane morphology of the tight junction in which the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane becomes closely apposed to that of an adjacent cell, proteins with potential properties to influence close membrane/membrane contacts, such as marvel domain proteins, may prove of significant interest in understanding the structure and function of tight junctions. tricellulin has been suggested to play a structural role in tricellular corners, which would be compatible with a role in forming and/or stabilising membrane/membrane contacts  <cit> . surprisingly, however, the analysis of patients carrying tricellulin mutations has so far only revealed defects in the cochlea and not other organs  <cit> . in the case of occludin, depletion and knockout experiments as well as expression studies with dominant mutations have thus far not suggested a role in tight junction structure  <cit> . however, it has recently been reported that depletion of occludin results in a more even distribution of tricellulin along the entire junctional length  <cit> . hence, different marvel domain proteins may be able to compensate for each other. with this in mind, it will be important to design approaches to study marvel domain proteins as a whole and to elucidate a function for the marvel domain itself.

depletion of marveld <dig> in caco- <dig> cells resulted in an increase in ter but did not affect permeability to fluorescent dextran tracers. since occludin overexpression was previously observed to increase ter  <cit> , we wondered whether the increased ter observed in the present study could be attributable to elevated levels of occludin expression. immunoblotting cell lysates from marveld <dig> knockdown cells however showed occludin levels, as well as levels of zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and zo- <dig>  to be unchanged. neither did we observe any significant changes in the distribution of these proteins by immunofluorescence. however, at this point it cannot be excluded that more subtle changes in occludin distribution might have caused the increase in ter. occludin knockdown has been shown to reduce expression levels of claudins  <dig> and  <dig> and increase levels of claudins  <dig> and  <dig> in mdck cells  <cit> . given the importance of claudin family members for paracellular ion permeability  <cit> , it is possible that marveld <dig> depletion affected claudin expression or function; though we have not been able to detect differences in claudin- <dig> expression. however, it is possible that other claudins are affected or that claudin activity is regulated by marveld <dig> 

marveld <dig> shows distant structural similarity to occludin. occludin and tricellulin are located in tandem on human chromosome  <dig> and it has been speculated that they may have arisen from gene duplication during phylogenetic evolution  <cit> . in contrast, marveld <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig> but is also expressed by all vertebrates, including birds, fish, amphibians and mammals. in contrast to occludin and tricellulin, all known isoforms and variants of marveld <dig> have short c-terminal cytoplasmic domains that are also distinct from each other. it is therefore unlikely that they are able to interact with zo- <dig> as those of occludin and tricellulin do  <cit> . in contrast, the n-terminal domain of marveld <dig>  which is shared by both isoforms, is long in comparison to that of occludin. intriguingly, the n-terminal domain of marveld <dig> is not as well conserved as the rest of the protein; however, it contains regions that are better conserved than others, which might be of functional relevance. in the case of occludin, this domain is thought to have a regulatory function and interacts with a ubiquitin ligase  <cit> . as the n-terminal domains of tight junction-associated marvel domain proteins are distinct in length and structure, they might provide structural links to different types of junctional regulatory mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
our experiments identify marveld <dig> as a novel member of the occludin family, a subgroup of the marvel domain proteins. marveld <dig> is expressed as two isoforms that show a broad tissue distribution. similarly to occludin, normal marveld <dig> expression is not essential for tight junction formation. nevertheless, knockdown of marveld <dig> affects the paracellular barrier properties of tight junctions by mechanisms that still have to be identified. tight junctions and occludin have not only been linked to epithelial barrier functions but also to the signalling mechanisms that guide epithelial proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . hence future studies will not only have to address the precise roles of marveld <dig> and other family members in tight junction structure and permeability properties, but also in the regulation of the subcellular signalling mechanisms that guide epithelial proliferation, differentiation and tissue formation.
