BACKGROUND
fructooligosaccharides  with a degree of polymerization  in the range of 2– <dig>  are one of the most important sources of carbon and energy for the beneficial microbiota  that exist in the intestinal lumen of humans  <cit> . fos are generally consumed directly as part of a healthy diet, including fruit and vegetables. fos can also be consumed indirectly through functional foods, which can be enriched with fos obtained by the hydrolysis of chicory inulin or produced industrially through enzymatic processes with commercial fructosyltransferases  from fungal species like aspergillus  <cit> . in the latter case, fungal enzymes are the preferred choice of enzyme because of their high specificity towards low molecular weight inulins, low hydrolytic activity and high stability  <cit> . in contrast, bacterial inulosucrases can be used to synthesize high molecular weight inulin with low specificity towards fos production  <cit> . ftfs  are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of the fructosyl moiety of sucrose to different acceptors, resulting in the synthesis of fructans with different molecular weights depending on the specificity of the enzyme. the fructosyl unit can also be transferred to water, resulting in the hydrolysis of sucrose. according to the classification system for carbohydrate-active enzymes, bacterial ftfs belong to family  <dig> of the glycoside hydrolases . most ftfs are  <dig> to 64 kda in length and consist of a single catalytic domain with a five-bladed β-propeller fold that encloses a funnel-like central cavity where the conserved catalytic residues are located. ftfs can be classified as inulosucrases , which synthesize β2- <dig> linked fructans , or levansucrases , which produce fructans with β2- <dig> linkages   <cit> .

we previously reported the isolation of inulosucrase from leuconostoc citreum cw <dig>  this particular enzyme was designated isla and was found to synthesize high-molecular-weight inulin. isla is a multidomain enzyme containing additional regions at both the amino- and carboxyl-terminals of its catalytic domain, which are similar to those found in glucosyltransferases  <cit> . in this context, isla <dig> is a truncated form of isla that retains only the five-bladed β-propeller catalytic domain. isla <dig> is therefore similar to several other fructosyltransferases previously reported in the literature, including the levansucrases from bacillus subtilis  and gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, and the inuj inulosucrase from lactobacillus johnsonii ncc  <dig>  we previously studied the effects of the additional domains of isla on its overall properties and found that isla <dig> was similar to isla, in the sense that it produced mainly high molecular weight inulin. however, isla <dig> exhibits a much higher hydrolytic activity than isla under the same reaction conditions  <cit> . interestingly, isla developed a high level of hydrolytic activity following the elimination of some of its additional domains, and achieved similar activity to a single domain fructosyltransferase, such as levansucrase sacb, which can hydrolyze as much as 80% of the sucrose substrate  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that reaction specificity  as well as product specificity  in fructosyltransferases is strongly dependent on the reaction conditions, including the substrate concentration and temperature  <cit> , the form in which the enzyme is applied, such as free or immobilized  <cit> , the presence of organic solvents or co-solvents  <cit> , and the source of the enzyme  <cit> .

in this study, we have evaluated the effect of the reaction conditions on the specificity of isla <dig> and the truncated form of inulosucrase isla, in an attempt to identify efficient enzymes for the synthesis of inulin-type fos.

RESULTS
influence of substrate and enzyme concentration on isla <dig> reaction specificity
a common characteristic of fructosyltransferases is their ability to transfer the fructosyl moieties of a substrate to an acceptor molecule  or water, leading to the hydrolysis of the substrate. the effects of the islaa <dig> and sucrose concentrations on the transfer and hydrolysis reactions of the fructosyl moiety are shown in figure  <dig>  as in many other ftf cases, transferase activity is favored by high substrate concentrations, because of the higher amount of sucrose molecules available with respect to water for the initial transfer of the fructosyl residue  <cit> . similar behavior has also been reported for levansucrase from b. subtilis, where almost 80% of the sucrose was used for transferase reactions at sucrose concentrations greater than  <dig>  mm  <cit> . in contrast, sacb becomes predominantly hydrolytic in terms of its activity at low sucrose concentrations   <cit> . furthermore, levansucrase from g. diazotrophicus displayed only hydrolytic activity at sucrose concentrations lower than 60 mm  <cit> . an inverse reaction specificity effect was observed for the enzyme concentration of isla <dig>  where an increase in the enzyme concentration from  <dig> to  <dig> u ml− <dig> led to an increase in the level of hydrolytic activity, regardless of the sucrose concentration. reactions involving a low enzyme concentration and high substrate concentration  were therefore determined to be suitable reaction conditions for high transferase efficiencies, despite the lengthy reaction times required. in contrast, a high isla <dig> concentration  coupled with a low sucrose concentration  led to 90% of the sucrose being hydrolyzed. similar behavior has also been reported for several other enzymes, such as sacb from b. subtilis, which transferred 78% of  <dig>  mm sucrose at low enzyme concentrations  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
transferase efficiency of isla <dig> as a function of enzyme and substrate concentration. all reactions are carried out at 30°c in 50 mm phosphate  containing 1 mm cacl <dig> and allowed to proceed until they reached a sucrose conversion of approximately 90%.



with regard to other inulosucrases, it has been reported that the transfructosylation activity of l. reuteri  <dig> increased when the substrate and enzyme concentration were increased from  <dig> to 1800 mm and  <dig> to  <dig> u mg− <dig>  respectively, with fos being identified as the main transferase product together with a relatively small amount of polymeric inulin material. in contrast, the same enzyme becomes predominantly hydrolytic in its activity at concentrations lower than 200 mm  <cit> . similar results have also been reported for isla, which became increasingly efficient in terms of ability to synthesize inulin when the initial concentration of sucrose in the reaction medium was increased  <cit> . several other partially truncated forms of isla have also exhibited similar reaction specificity behavior  <cit> .

an extreme example of this behavior is levansucrase sacb, which shares 39% identity with inulosucrase isla <dig>  in this case, the enzyme concentration has a much stronger influence on the reaction specificity, with the hydrolysis of 300 mm sucrose increasing from  <dig> to 98% at 35°c when the enzyme activity is increased from  <dig> to  <dig> u ml− <dig>  <cit> .

product profile analysis
tlc analysis
the most interesting aspect of the product specificity exhibited by isla <dig> is that although isla is responsible for the synthesis of high molecular weight inulin, the combination of a truncated domain with the appropriate reaction conditions can results in the synthesis of a wide variety of fos as the major transferase products. this effect can be readily visualized by tlc analysis, as shown in figure  <dig>  in this particular case, the fos and inulin could both be clearly seen amongst the final reaction products when the products of reactions containing  <dig> u ml− <dig> of enzyme activity are analyzed at three different initial sucrose concentrations. a direct comparison with standard compounds suggested that 1-kestose -β-d-fructofuranosyl--α-d-glucopyranoside) would be the first acceptor product, and that this product form as a consequence of a fructosyl transfer reaction to sucrose, followed by 1-nystose -β-d-fructofuranosyl--β-d-fructofuranosyl-α-d-glucopyranoside) and f-nystose -β-d-fructofuranosyl--β-d-fructofuranosyl--β-d-fructofuranosyl-α-d-glucopyranoside), which were only observed after an extended reaction time. however, an increase in the substrate concentration led to an increase in fos synthesis, which was accompanied by an increase in transferase activity. furthermore, there was a shift in the product profile with fos with a low dp being observed at a sucrose concentration of 292 mm , while fos with a dp greater than  <dig> fructose units were obtained at a sucrose concentration of  <dig>  mm. inulin was formed as the major synthetic product under the standard reaction conditions  using both isla and its truncated form isla <dig>  furthermore, the various fos already described above were only observed as a small part of the product stream  <cit> . the reaction conditions can therefore be defined in detail to considerably reduce the inulin concentration in favor of forming fos. in the case of l. reuteri  <dig> inulosucrase, 1-kestose and nystose were reported to be the only products obtained from 263 mm sucrose after 17 h of reaction  <cit> . however, an increase in the sucrose concentration to 840 mm led to the formation of additional fos with a dp greater than five, regardless of the inulin concentration  <cit> . in the same context, inuj and inuga, which are inulosucrases from l. johnsonii ncc  <dig>  <cit>  and lactobacillus gasseri dsm  <dig>  <cit> , respectively, can synthesize inulin together with a wide range of fos with dp values greater than five after long reaction times in reactions containing 600 mm of sucrose. similar behavior has also been reported for zymomonas mobilis levansucrase, where the product specificity shifted from levan to fos when the sucrose concentration was increased to 800 mm  <cit> . levansucrase from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis tmw and a truncated version of the same protein also exhibited similar behavior  <cit> .figure  <dig>

one important thing to consider regarding the isla <dig> reaction mechanism is that the low molecular weight fos products appear to be synthesized by a non-processive mechanism. in this case, all of the fos accumulating in the solution were derived from 1-kestose, which is the first reaction product formed when sucrose is used as an acceptor . it has been proposed previously that subsites + <dig> and + <dig>  further away from the cleavage site , could have a low affinity for the growing fos chains, and that these sites would then release the product once the fructosyl unit had been transferred, representing the basis of a non-processive mechanism  <cit> . however, this mechanism does not appear to be applicable to the case of inulin, which is most likely synthesized through a processive mechanism because inulin is only observed in the reaction medium in this case as a high molecular weight product.

gpc and hpaec-pad analysis
the effect of the enzyme concentration and the substrate to enzyme ratio on the molecular weight distribution of the inulin synthesized by isla <dig> was analyzed by gpc, and the results are shown in figure  <dig>  this result clearly shows that a product with an average molecular weight of  <dig>  kda was obtained following 14 min of elution. the distribution and size of the inulin produced was therefore independent of the enzyme concentration and of lower molecular weight than inulin produced by l. reuteri  <dig>  <cit>  and l. johnsonii ncc  <dig>  <cit> , which reached molecular weights as high as  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. this result also revealed that high enzyme concentrations favored the hydrolysis reaction, which resulted in the synthesis of small amounts of inulin . this behavior can therefore be explained in terms of the interactions between the enzyme molecules or enzyme-polymer molecules rather than the availability of active sites for a given sucrose concentration.figure  <dig>

hpaec-pad analysis allowed for the identification of the synthesized fos. an hpaec-pad chromatogram of the products obtained at three different enzyme concentrations is shown in figure  <dig>  based on the retention times of the standards, the signals obtained at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  min were attributed to 1-kestose, 6-kestose -β-d-fructofuranosyl--α-d-glucopyranoside), neokestose -β-d-fructofuranosyl-α-d-glucopyranoside), nystose and f-nystose, respectively. although the amperometric detection intensity is not always proportional to the amount of product, the amount of synthesized fos decreased in the current system as the molecular weight of the product increased, in a similar manner to that reported for inu from l reuteri  <dig>  <cit> . this effect can be observed quantitatively in figure  <dig>  unidentified products were eluted between 1-kestose and 6-kestose , and between nystose and f-nystose . although these products have not yet been identified, the results suggest that the smallest fos obtained after an elution time of 5 min was blastosefigure  <dig>

 -α,β-d-glucopyranoside), which is an isomer of sucrose. blastose could be produced by the direct transfer of fructose to glucose in c <dig> or by the hydrolysis of the trisaccharide neokestose , which is a transfer product resulting from the transfer of fructose to the c6-position of the glucose unit in sucrose. interestingly, these unidentified products were also reported in inulosucrase from l. reuteri <dig>  <cit>  and l. johnsonii ncc  <dig>  <cit> . however, the formation of these products does not represent a general property of inulosucrases, because these products were not observed in inuga and inugb from l. gasseri, where linear β 2- <dig> fos was the only fos obtained from the direct transfer of fructose to the c1-position of the fructose acceptor  <cit> .

the highest transferase yield for the reaction was obtained at the highest sucrose concentration and the resulting fos profile is shown in figure  <dig>  once again, the reaction led to the formation of large amounts of 1-kestose, 6-kestose, neokestose, nystose and f-nystose, as well as a large amount of fos with a dp > <dig>  despite the limitations of the separation equipment, several products were observed with retention time in excess of 20 min. this behavior was similar to that reported for l. reuteri  <dig>  which gave fos with a higher dp than nystose when it was synthesized under high substrate concentrations  <cit> .figure  <dig>

quantitative analysis of the inulin and fos synthesized by isla4
the amount of fructose transferred and incorporated into inulin  was determined from a reference plot relating inulin gpc elution area to inulin concentration, which was constructed according to the procedure described above using inulin precipitated with ethanol and subsequently freeze-dried. with this methodology in hand, it was possible to demonstrate that although the inulin synthesis was independent of the substrate concentration, this factor is still an important function of enzyme concentration and activity. overall, the level of inulin synthesis was found to be negligible at high enzyme concentrations, as shown in table  <dig>  these results therefore suggested that the increase in transferase activity that results from the rise in substrate concentration could be attributed to the exclusive synthesis of fos, as already shown by tlc and hpaec-pad .table  <dig>

in quantitative terms, it was possible to reduce the amount of inulin from  <dig> to  <dig> or 1 g l− <dig> by increasing the isla <dig> concentration from  <dig> to  <dig> or  <dig> u ml− <dig> respectively, at any of the three sucrose concentrations studied. the highest amount of inulin produced under these reaction conditions was significantly higher than that reported for inulosucrase from l. reuteri  <dig>  where only  <dig>  g l− <dig> inulin was obtained from 90 g l− <dig> of sucrose. although no explanation was offered for the result obtained in this particular case, the incubation times reported would only have allowed for an 18% conversion  <cit> . in the same context, the highest polymer yield  obtained with isla <dig> was very similar to the yield of inulin calculated for the inulosucrases inuga and inugb from l. gasseri, which produced  <dig> and 13 g l− <dig> of inulin, respectively, from their reactions with 205 g l− <dig> of sucrose  <cit> . in contrast, inuj from l. johnsonii ncc  <dig> allowed for the synthesis of  <dig>  g l− <dig> of inulin from 200 g l− <dig> of sucrose  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that isla <dig> is a much more suitable enzyme for the synthesis of inulin than any of the other inulosucrases currently available, even at low substrate concentrations , where hydrolysis is the dominant reaction pathway. however, based on the fos concentration, ffos , which can be indirectly calculated according to the method described above, a low concentration of ffos  was obtained when the reactions were conducted at 292 mm, which was the lowest sucrose concentration evaluated . as shown in figure  <dig>  these reaction conditions also induced high levels of hydrolysis, as exemplified by the reaction conducted with  <dig> u ml− <dig> of enzyme activity, where up to 89% of the substrate was converted to glucose and fructose. furthermore, increasing the sucrose concentration from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm in reactions with  <dig> u ml− <dig> of enzyme activity, led to a two-fold increase in the amount of fructose incorporated in the fos, despite the presence of a large amount of hydrolyzed sucrose  in the mixture.

figure  <dig> provides a detailed overview of the fate of each transferred fructose, in terms of whether it goes to water, inulin or fos. based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the majority of the fos synthesis was conducted from 2046 mm sucrose in reactions with  <dig> u ml− <dig> of enzyme, where 70% sucrose was used for transfer reactions, and 65% of this sucrose was directed towards a transfructosylation pathway for the synthesis of fos. in contrast, the use of a low sucrose concentration  led not only to a decrease in the transferase reaction but also favored polymer synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
an efficient set of reaction conditions have been established for the synthesis of fos and/or inulin using isla <dig> inulosucrase. in particular, the results of the current study have shown that the enzyme specificity can be shifted almost exclusively from the synthesis of high molecular weight inulin to the synthesis of fos. this shift was made possible in this truncated form of the multidomain inulosucrase isla through the careful selection of the enzyme and substrate concentration conditions. the results of the current study have also shown that the use of a high sucrose concentration in conjunction with a low isla <dig> concentration results in the highly efficient synthesis of low molecular weight fos, including 1-kestose, 6-kestose, neokestose, nystose and f-nystose.
