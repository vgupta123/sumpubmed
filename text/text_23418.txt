BACKGROUND
the nothofagaceae family contains only the genus nothofagus, and comprises  <dig> recognized species,  <dig> of which occur in australia and the remaining  <dig> in south america
 <cit> . nothofagus in argentina is represented by only six endemic species, distributed on the foothills of the andes and surrounding valleys, beginning with its appearance at 36° in the province of neuquen, and extending to 55°s, in the province of tierra del fuego
 <cit> .

among these species, n. obliqua, n. nervosa and n. pumilio, occupy a relatively precise range within an altitudinal gradient spanning from  <dig> m over the sea level up to  <dig> m. along this gradient each species withstand different environmental conditions, especially extremely cold temperatures at the higher altitudes. individual trees living in this environmental gradient, exhibit adaptive features for adverse conditions such as drought and extreme temperatures, traits that may prove value for adapting to future climate changes in the context of global climate change.

n. nervosa  dim.et mil <cit>   oerst) commonly known as “raulí”, is one of the most important species of patagonian temperate forests due to its wood quality and its relatively fast growth
 <cit> . in argentina it covers a reduced area, only  <dig>  hectares in a narrow fringe of about  <dig> km in length and about  <dig> km in maximum width
 <cit> . this deciduous species suffered a great overexploitation in the past due to its high wood quality, making necessary to implement conservation policies and management programs
 <cit> .

the distribution of adaptive genetic variation is an importance issue in forest species, both native and domesticated, serving as a basis for natural resource management and conservation genetics
 <cit> . the characterization of genetic diversity is also important in order to determine its relation with phenotypic variation
 <cit> . massive sequencing techniques are among the new strategies used in functional genomics for gene discovery and molecular markers development in non-model organisms or in those species whose genomes have not been completely sequenced. it provides a fast and effective way to get new genetic information of an organism and allows a rapid access to a collection of expressed sequences .

to date, model forest tree species belonging to eucalyptus genus
 <cit> , pinus, picea and populus <cit>  have comprehensive transcriptome information.

the fagaceae family  also holds a large number of sequenced transcripts with approximately  <dig>  millions of ests deposited in databases . at present, new sequencing technologies offer the possibility to obtain gene catalogs for non-model organism which is an opportunity for forest tree transcriptome characterization, discovery of alternative metabolic strategies and functional molecular markers
 <cit> .

one of the advantages of transcriptome pyrosequencing is in terms of sequence reliability. each region of the cdna is read several times in both strands compared to one sequence/one strand reading of conventional ests.

in this study we characterized leaf n. nervosa transcriptome by pyrosequencing and analyzed the resulting sequence data. moreover, the functional annotation of the unigenes, allowed us to have a global but throughout picture of leaf functional gene expression, as well as to deduce the metabolic pathway represented in this dataset.

this information will significantly contribute to the development of nothofagus functional genomics, genetics and population-based genome studies. in addition, the rather limited set of molecular markers available until now:  <dig> microsatellites isolated from n. cunnighamii <cit> ,  <dig> developed in six species of south american nothofagus <cit> , five in n. nervosa <cit> , and nine microsatellite loci from n. pumilio <cit> , will be substantially increased with thousands of new markers, both from neutral and functional sequences. the quality of the sequence information here reported was confirmed by the successful pcr amplification of molecular markers using oligonucleotide primers designed with the deduced sequences.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and assembly
pyrosequencing of cdna on a  <dig> gs flx titanium  generated a total of  <dig>  raw reads, with an average length of  <dig> bp. after filtering for adaptors, primer and low-quality sequences,  <dig>  reads were removed resulting in  <dig>  high quality reads corresponding to 96% of the first raw sequences, representing approximately  <dig> mbp. raw data  were deposited in ncbi sequence read archive  under the accession number sra <dig> .

by using newbler software v.  <dig>  ; a total of  <dig>  sequences were de novo assembled into  <dig>  contiguous sequences . overlapping contigs were assembled into  <dig>  isotigs . in addition, isotigs originating from the same contig-graph were grouped into  <dig>  isogroups  by newbler, potentially reflecting multiple splice variants. about  <dig>  reads not assembled into isotigs were clustered using cd-hit- <dig> algorithm to eliminate artificial duplicates leaving  <dig>  singletons, summing up a total of  <dig>  non-redundant sequences or unigenes . all unigene sequences  were deposited to the transcriptome shotgun assembly  database, accession numbers jt763459-jt <dig>  isotig length ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp, with an overall average length of 765 ±  <dig> bp . more than 83% of the isotigs were  <dig> to  <dig>  bp long and 50% of the assembled bases were incorporated into isotigs greater than  <dig> bp. the average length of n. nervosa isotigs  was larger than those assembled in other non model organisms , and similar to the average isotig length described in bituminaria bituminosa .

numbers and percentages of  <dig> sequences in the assembled isotigs, singletons and unigenes with significant matches against ncbi nr proteins viridiplantae filtered database and fagaceae unigenes.

the coverage depth for isotigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> contigs assembled into each isotig, which is larger than the averages obtained in other  <dig> transcriptome analyses .

the length distribution of the  <dig>  singletons ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp with an overall average length of  <dig>  bp . the length of 86% of the singletons was shorter than  <dig> bp.

functional annotation
all unique sequences were subjected to blastx similarity search against the nr protein database , with a viridiplantae filter, to assign a putative function
 <cit> .

under an e-value threshold of < <dig> - <dig>  a total of  <dig>  isotigs  and  <dig>  singletons sequences  had significant blastx matches . the frequency of annotated isotigs was significantly higher than the values previously reported for de novo transcriptome assemblies of eukaryotes that range from  <dig> to 40%
 <cit> .

in total,  <dig>  unique sequences had at least one hit, while the remaining sequences  <dig>   exhibited less significant matches  but still informative for identifying putative biological functions in future studies in this species. we also performed a blastx against the ncbi - nr protein database to retrieve sequences that did not show blast hits against viridiplantae ncbi, which summed up some few new hits , but not adding any other valuable annotations.

the majority of matched sequences exhibited high similarity to vitis vinífera , and populus trichocarpa  sequences. the top-hit species distribution of blast matches is shown in figure
 <dig> 

annotation and mapping routines were run with blast2go platform
 <cit> . sequences with a positive blast match were annotated using gene ontology terms  and enzyme commission categories . thus, go terms were assigned to  <dig>  isotigs  and  <dig>  singletons  totalizing  <dig>  go terms .

of the  <dig>  go annotated isotigs and singletons sequences, most were assigned to “biological processes” , “molecular functions”  and “cellular components” , .

blast2go analysis at process level  <dig>  showed that among  <dig> different biological processes most of the transcripts belonged either to “metabolic processes” , to “cellular processes”  and to “response to stimuli” , of which  <dig> were putative stress-response genes .

likewise, the molecular function category subdivided annotated sequences into binding , catalytic activity  and transporters  as the most represented .

a detailed blast2go analysis  at the cellular component category, sorted all transcripts from n. nervosa into  <dig> groups being the most representative: cell , organelle  and macromolecular complex component  .

in order to more precisely compare the similarity of n. nervosa genes with those of the fagaceae family , n. nervosa unigenes were subjected to blat  search against  <dig> , <dig> contigs and singletons from american beech , american chestnut , chinese chestnut  and oak species . eighty-two percent of the n. nervosa expressed sequences exhibited high similarity to fagaceae genes. a total of  <dig>   sequences did not show matches against fagaceae sequences, from which there were  <dig> isotigs and  <dig>  singletons. among them,  <dig> isotigs and  <dig> singletons had distinctive go annotation, which could be considered as novel genes for this large group of tree species . most interestingly, from these transcripts  <dig> were found to be potentially new genes for stress response .

of the  <dig>  sequences annotated with go terms,  <dig>  were assigned with ec numbers  .

the most represented enzymes in all sequences are shown in figure
4: transferase activity , hydrolase activity  and oxidoreductase activity  were the most abundant.

to further enhance the annotation of n. nervosa transcriptome dataset, the  <dig>  genes with go terms were mapped to kegg using kegg automatic annotation server 
 <cit> . the identified  <dig> metabolic pathways include: purine metabolism , thiamine metabolism , t cell receptor signalling pathway , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , and microbial metabolism in diverse environments  .

we detected as much as  <dig> chloroplast  sequences , corresponding to a quite high rate , but this value was within the  <dig> to 10% found in cdna libraries from all tissue types, as reported in a study conducted in oak
 <cit> .

the number of annotated isotigs in this study was comparatively larger than that obtained in other similar studies
 <cit> . these results could be associated with the high quality and small number of assembled isotigs, which potentially corresponds to highly expressed genes. also the use of specific plant protein sequences and close related fagaceae database possibly increased the blast hits. the first assumption comprises technical issues such as a high percentage of isotigs that was greater than ~ <dig> bp length and with good coverage depth. moreover, the small number of isotigs would be detecting the most represented and known expressed genes, as it was also shown in the analyses of b. bituminosa leaf transcriptome 
 <cit> . proportions of best hits in major go category were generally similar to those found in this species, for example, binding 48% and catalytic activity 37% in the n. nervosa transcriptome survey versus 37% and 37% respectively for the same categories in b. bituminosa.

the second statement relies on the annotation approach based on the search against the viridiplantae protein database. this strategy allows to more likely finding blast hits above the cut off value. in addition, a higher percentage of reliable annotated isotigs was found when the searched was carried out against the fagaceae protein sequence dataset . the favorable effect of using specific databases for annotation was also reported for other authors
 <cit> .

besides, the lower percentage of singletons that were annotated was likely due to the high frequency of short length sequences, also reported in recent studies
 <cit> . fifty percent of non-annotated singletons were shorter than  <dig> bp , whereas the 50% in annotated singletons were longer than  <dig> bp. similar results were obtained in pinus contorta where only 5% of contigs and singletons had blast matches when the length of the sequences was less than  <dig> bp
 <cit> . nonetheless, many singletons were good quality reads and matched to proteins in blast searches representing together with the isotigs, a great source of information.

summarizing, the frequency of annotated isotigs and singletons was significantly higher than previously reported for new generation sequencing de novo transcriptome assemblies of trees like pinus contorta <cit> , or two oaks species, quercus petraea and q. robur <cit> , even though the high stringency of blastx analysis.

if we assume that the average number of genes encoded in a plant nuclear genome is about  <dig> thousands 
 <cit> , our annotated dataset likely represents a half of the n. nervosa genes catalogue.

in order to test the presence of expressed repetitive sequences, blastn  searches were performed against all viridiplantae repbase . a total of  <dig> repetitive dna sequences were found . from all the rrna sequences,  <dig> corresponded to small subunit rrna ,  <dig> to large subunit rrna  and  <dig> to transposable elements. similar numbers of retrotransposon were observed in other plant species 
 <cit> . however, in fagopyrum esculentum and pinus contorta much more transcribed retrotransposable elements were found in the different tissues sampled
 <cit> .

in silico mining of single sequence repeats 
using the ssr webserver from the genome database for rosaceae , we identified and characterized several ssrs  motives as potential molecular markers in the nothofagus unigene collection.

the criteria used for ssr selection based on the minimum number of repeats was as follows: five for dinucleotide, four for trinucleotide, three for tetranucleotide and three for penta and hexanucleotide motives. these settings resulted in the identification of  <dig>  putative ssrs within  <dig>  unigenes i.e. ssr frequency of 15% considering multiple occurrences in a same unigene element. this was similar than that reported in oak 19% by durand
 <cit>  and somewhat lower than 24%, estimated by ueno
 <cit> . a total of  <dig>   unigenes contained at least one ssr, and  <dig>  ssrs  had sufficient flanking sequences to allow the design of appropriate unique primers. information on the unigene identification , marker id, repeat motive, repeat length, primer sequences, positions of forward and reverse primers, and expected fragment length are included in additional file
 <dig> 

characterization of microsatellite motives
as expected, the most frequent type of microsatellite corresponded to trimeric  and dimeric motives , being tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats present at much lower frequencies . similar results were found in oak
 <cit>   with the minimum repeat number of five and four for di- and tri-microsatellites, respectively.

ssr motif combinations can be grouped into unique classes based on dna base complementarities. for example, dinucleotides were grouped into the following four unique classes: at/ta; ag/ga/ct/tc; ac/ca/tg/gt and gc/cg. thus, the numbers of unique classes possible for di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide repeats are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively
 <cit> . the ag/ct group was the predominant class  of the dinucleotide repeats, whereas at , ac  and cg  groups were less represented. the frequency of ag was similar to the highest value reported by kumpatla
 <cit>   but lower than that found in oak 
 <cit>  and eucalypts 
 <cit> .

the most frequent trimeric ssr motives were the aag/ctt , atg/cat , agc/gct  and agg/cct , similar to the first category found in oak 
 <cit> . within tetrameric motives, aaat repeat was found to be the most abundant , followed by aaag  and aaca .

the topography of ssr distribution was analyzed for ssr presence within utrs and coding sequence regions. about 45% of the ssr sequences were inside orf sequences. most trinucleotide repeats were found in orfs , while dinucleotides were more frequent in the utrs , similar to those reported in oak
 <cit>  and pines
 <cit> . it is expected that tri- and hexanucleotide repeats would occur more frequently than other motifs in coding sequences. such dominance of triplets over other repeats in coding regions may be explained on the basis of the selective disadvantage of non-trimeric ssr variants in coding regions, possibly causing frame-shift mutations
 <cit> .

validation of the predicted microsatellite markers
seventy three microsatellites were selected according to their sequence length, gc content and functional annotation related to abiotic stress category.

from these, 57% were located in coding regions. the  <dig> loci were tested for successful pcr amplification in six individuals. all of them were effectively amplified validating the quality of the assembly and the utility of the ssrs produced. a similar research carried using illumina sequencing technology in sesame showed that about 90% primer pairs successfully amplified dna fragments
 <cit> . on the other side, the rate of ssr validation was lower  when the marker mining was done using est produced by sanger technology
 <cit>  possibly because of low-quality est sequences, and/or primer sequences derived from chimerical cdna clones.

about 20%  of the tested nothofagus ssrs were polymorphic and showed at least one individual that differed in allelic composition.

this relative low percentage of polymorphic loci could be explained because of the small sample size tested , in contrast to the 46% found in e. globulus <cit>  evaluated in  <dig> samples, and the 80% found in sesame
 <cit>  essayed in  <dig> samples.

nine of the polymorphic ssr found in this work were located within predicted orf and seven had repeat motives multiple of three , according to their presence in coding regions
 <cit> .

included are id names, primer names, motive and number of repeats, position in orf, sequence of forward and reverse primers , amplicon length , blastx similarity matches , sequence length, similarity mean , go terms related to stress response.

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome database obtained and characterized here represents a major contribution for n. nervosa genomics and genetics. it will be useful for discovering genes of interest and genetic markers to investigate functional diversity in natural populations, and as well as conduct comparative genomics studies in southern beeches taking advantage of their remarkable ecophysiological differences. this work highlights the utility of transcriptome high performance sequencing as a fast and cost effective way for obtaining rapid information on the coding of genetic variation in nothofagus genus. this study allowed us to:  obtain  <dig>  transcript raw reads and  <dig>  unigene sequences from n. nervosa,  identify putative function in  <dig>  unigenes for the genus that potentially represent 50% of n. nervosa transcriptome,  identify  <dig> putative stress-response genes ,  discover  <dig>  ssrs with designed primers and  detect  <dig> polymorphic ssr related to stress response.
