BACKGROUND
rice is the first crop plant from which a high-quality reference genome sequence from a single variety has been produced. single nucleotide polymorphisms  may be functionally responsible for specific traits or phenotypes, or they may be informative in tracing the evolutionary history of a species or the pedigree of a variety. snps are rapidly replacing simple sequence repeats  because these are more abundant, stable, amenable to automation, efficient, and increasingly cost-effective  <cit> .

snps have become the genetic marker of choice in the analysis of partially or completely sequenced genomes due to its ubiquity in the genome  <cit> . in rice, the primary sequencing data that led to the first whole-genome snp discovery was derived from the draft sequences of the japonica cultivar nipponbare and indica cultivar 93– <dig>  <cit> . the snp pools were mainly limited to two varieties. another snp discovery set from the oryzasnp project has identified approximately  <dig>  high-quality snps and has provided more insights by detecting informative snps across  <dig> diverse rice varieties  <cit> . next-generation sequencing at 19× coverage across  <dig> rice varieties has identified over  <dig>  million snps, of which  <dig>  snps were located within coding regions  <cit> . recently, rice re-sequencing projects have been conducted for various germplasm .

the decreasing cost, along with the rapid advancement of next-generation sequencing technology and related bioinformatics resources, has facilitated the large-scale discovery of snps in various plant species. genotyping-by-sequencing  is a next-generation-sequencing based method that takes advantage of reduced representation to enable high-throughput genotyping of a large number of snp markers. gbs has been applied in snp genotyping for quantitative trait loci  mapping and gene identification in rice . the tassel-gbs pipeline successfully fulfills the following key design criteria:  ability to run on the modest computing resources, including desktop or laptop machines with only 8–16 gb of ram;  scalability from small to extremely large studies, in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of snps can be scored;  applicability in a fast-breeding context, in which rapid genotyping is required due to the high frequency of tissue collection  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> parental lines were selected for gbs because of their specific characteristics, including grain quality in rice breeding. guichao <dig> and ir <dig> are two varieties with indica rice characters such as seed type and disease resistance  <cit> . guichao <dig> was of interest because of its wide range of adaptability, high yield potential, and could be planted as an early, or middle, or late variety. however, this particular variety was later excluded because of bad grain quality. koshihikari and asominori are varieties from japan, and ussr <dig> is a variety from russia that shows typical japonica rice characters such as good quality, but is susceptible to rice strip virus disease   <cit> . sasanishiki is a high-yielding indica cultivar  <cit> . habataki has very high yield potential and a short, stiff stem, but is susceptible to cold during booting and early growth  <cit> . kasalath harbors resistance genes against standard differential blast isolates from the philippines and japan  <cit> . nanjing <dig> has superior grain yield, but poor appearance. n <dig> possesses qtl/genes related to dormancy  <cit> . rils and nils derived from these parental varieties are currently under investigation for genes controlling agronomic traits; therefore the snp database will be very useful for gene mapping and isolation by using high-density snp markers. the number of recombination events and the marker density of parental varieties determine the resolution of gene mapping. by using the cost-effective gbs approach, we have detected snps among the parents of  <dig> rice recombination line populations.

the p450s in biosynthetic pathways play critical roles in the synthesis of lignins, pigments, defense compounds, fatty acids, hormones, and signaling molecules  <cit> . cyp <dig> shows higher homology with cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> compared to the other p450s, and these are all non a-type p450s belonging to cyp <dig>  <cit> . cyp704b <dig> is involved in anther cutin biosynthesis and pollen exine formation in rice  <cit> . cyp704a <dig> is a member of the cyp family, and most of its family members are located in the er  <cit> , including cyp78a <dig>  which influences grain size and yield in rice  <cit> . we herein report snps for the parental varieties of mapping populations and a mirna regulated gene, cyp704a <dig>  underlying rice seed size.

RESULTS
sequencing and variation calling
we identified a total of  <dig>  polymorphic snps in  <dig> parental varieties and nipponbare in relation to the reference genome . to explore the genomic distribution of the patterns of dna polymorphisms between the indica and japonica subspecies, the snp count based on our sample was plotted along each chromosome . snp count  was defined as the number of snps in a 200-kb interval. non-random patterns of snp distribution were observed, with highly different snp frequencies detected on all chromosomes. these data support previous findings that polymorphisms in the rice genome  are non-randomly distributed  <cit> . relatively low snp polymorphisms were observed in the regions highlighted in green bars , which could be due to stringent recombination restrictions, or lack of restriction enzyme sites or reads in these regions. more markers need to be developed in these low-density snp regions for qtl/gene mapping.fig.  <dig> distribution of snps in  <dig> chromosomes of different rice varieties. the x-axis represents the physical distance along each chromosome, which is split into 200-kb windows. the total size of each chromosome is shown in brackets. the y-axis indicates the number of snps. the regions with relatively high and low density are labeled in red and green bars, respectively



we aimed to detect snps in the difference rice varieties by using the tassel gbs pipeline. furthermore, we validated  <dig> snp genotypes  from  <dig> chromosomes, respectively, by using sanger sequencing on the abi3730xl dna sequencher  with the bigdye v <dig>  kit. the snp database with a low rate of missing data will be useful for qtl detection in the populations derived from the  <dig> varieties.

the phylogenetic tree produced using the  <dig>  snps revealed three distinct groups, with japonicas clustered into one group, and the other two groups together with aus and indica types . three distinct groups were identified by principal component analysis with well-separated lines, corresponding to indica, aus, and japonica rice species . consistent with the phenotypical classification, the varieties from china, guichao <dig>  nanjing <dig> and nanjing <dig> were grouped into the indica type, together with ir <dig> and ir <dig> from irri; the varieties from japan, sasanishiki, koshihikari, habataki, and asominori were grouped into japonica, together with ussr <dig> from russia; the varieties n <dig> and kasalath from india were grouped into aus. based on this classification, more snp polymorphisms could be expected between the parental lines with distinct relationships. thus, germplasm classification of the  <dig> rice varieties was properly conducted and the results were informative for further ril or nil construction.fig.  <dig> genetic structure and population differentiation in  <dig> rice parental varieties. a unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  dendrogram based on  <dig>  snps. b principal component analysis for the entire set of rils 



we checked  <dig> snp genotypes showing the same genotypes within indica and japonica subgroups by using sanger sequencing on the abi3730xl dna sequencher  using the bigdye v <dig>  kit. sequences generated by each primer pair were aligned using sequencher and snps were validated by visual inspection.

snp annotations and large-effect snps
the snps were annotated and classified based on their location in intergenic regions, introns, 5′-utr, 3′-utr or exon  . we analyzed the snps with potentially large effects on gene expression and protein alterations.table  <dig> summary of snps in the  <dig> varieties



the mutant of the cytochrome p <dig> gene cyp724b <dig> accumulates large amounts of mrna; furthermore, its seed is shorter than that of the wide-type  <cit> . in the present study, we detected an a/t polymorphism between asominori and ir <dig> that was associated with short- and long-grain phenotypes respectively. the snp in the fourth exon  is predicted to result in the amino acid alteration of aspartic acid to valine. these findings suggest that cyp704a <dig> might be associated with grain length. thus, we decided to further investigate a protein-altering a/t polymorphism located in the exon of the cytochrome p <dig> gene, cyp704a <dig> .

we sequenced this gene that exhibited a total of four snps, with two present in the exon and two within the 3′-utr. a g/a snp  in the 3′-utr was detected in the binding region between cyp704a <dig> and its mirna gene, osa-mirf10422-akr .fig.  <dig>

we also observed the effects of cyp704a <dig> on grain length in a population consisting  <dig> rice landraces by developing a snp marker for g/a genotyping the cyp704a <dig> gene. the average seed length of plants with the ir <dig> allele  was longer than that harboring the asominori allele  . because of the positive seed length/snp correlation and the critical position of snp in the binding region, we deduced that the snp mutation was crucial to grain size.

seeds with cyp704a <dig> of ir <dig> allele genotype were longer than that of asominori allele . we further compared the expression levels of cyp704a <dig> in maturing seeds of ir <dig> and asominori with long and short seeds respectively. the seeds of ir <dig> with longer size had relative lower expression of cyp704a <dig> .

to verify the subcellular location of cyp704a <dig>  we constructed a cyp704a3-gfp fusion expression vector, and then transformed the recombinant expression vector into rice protoplasts. confocal microscopy showed that the green fluorescent signals of cyp704a3-gfp co-localized with the autofluorescence signals of the er .

to further confirm the function of cyp704a <dig>  cyp704a3-rnai transgenic rice plants were generated. several independently transformed plants showed a reduction in the level of expression of the cyp704a <dig> gene . three of these were selected to represent the relative expression of cyp704a <dig> in relation to the transgenic negative control rnai- <dig> . the reduced expression of cyp704a <dig> caused various degrees of elongation in grain length . significant difference  in grain length  and length/width ratio   among the wild-type, rnai- <dig>  and oscyp704a3-rnai transgenic plants were observed. these results further indicated that cyp704a <dig> negatively regulates grain length in rice.fig.  <dig> cyp704a3-rnai transgenic plantsproduced longer grains. a the morphology of wild-type and rnai- <dig> transgenic plants. scale bar: 10 mm. b relative expression levels of cyp704a <dig> mrna of the wild-type rnai- <dig>  and t1cyp704a3-rnai transgenic plants which were determined by qrt-pcr. c grains of the wild-type, rnai- <dig> , rnai- <dig>  rnai- <dig> and rnai- <dig>  scale bar: 1 mm. d grain length . e grain length to width ratio 



interaction between osa-mirf10422-akr and the cyp704a <dig> target gene
to validate that cyp704a <dig> is regulated by osa-mirf10422-akr, a schematic representation of the reporters and the effectors  was used in this assay. to examine the ability of plant expression vectors to produce osa-mirf10422-akr mirnas in vivo, an agrobacterium strain harboring pcambia1300-35s:osa-mirf10422-akr or the control pcambia  <dig> vector  was infiltrated into n. benthamiana leaves, together with the reporter gene egfp which was fused with the 3′-utr of the rice cyp704a <dig> gene, which contained the putative mirna target. when the effecter recognizes the mirna target in the reporter construct, the mrna level of egfp and the fluorescence of egfp are downregulated. the fluorescence of the agroinfiltrated leaves was taken at  <dig> dpi under uv illumination. fluorescence imaging showed that egfp and osa-mirf10422-akr were co-expressed  and together with mirna target region in the 3′-utr of the cyp704a <dig> gene . total rna was extracted at  <dig> dpi, and quantitative egfp mrna analysis using the average measurements of three leaves utilized in each infiltration treatment . as expected, osa-mirf10422-akr expression affected the cyp704a <dig> gene expression both at the transcriptional and protein levels. these findings therefore indicate that osa-mirf10422-akr participates in seed size determination by directly regulating cyp704a <dig> fig.  <dig> the effects of osa-mirf10422-akrexpression on the accumulation of the cyp704a <dig> gene. the schematic representation of the reporters and the effectors used in this assay is shown in . gfp fluorescence images of the co-expression of osa-mirf10422-akr with the reporter gene egfp, which was fused with the empty vector control  and mirna target region in the 3′-utr of the cyp704a <dig> gene . fluorescence imaging analysis of the agroinfiltrated leaves at  <dig> dpi under uv illumination. quantitation of egfp mrna as averaged from three leaves from each infiltration treatment 



the cyp704a <dig> target gene underwent selection for seed size improvement
to test whether the cyp704a <dig> target gene and the osa-mirf10422-akr had undergone selection within the parental varieties, we calculated the linkage disequilibrium  of the two genes and its flanking regions on both sides using our gbs data. ld analysis of the two genomic regions, namely, osa-mirf10422-akr and its putative target gene, cyp704a <dig>  of these parental varieties, revealed different patterns of ld blocks . the r2-values for the mirna osa-mirf10422-akr did not show any increase in these parental varieties that are commonly used in rice breeding. no ld blocks were detected in the osa-mirf10422-akr region  on chromosome  <dig> . in contrast, the r2-values of the cyp704a <dig> gene increased in these parental varieties. a strong ld block was detected in the target gene loc_os04g <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . the detection of a strong ld block in cyp704a <dig> compared to that in the mirna gene indicated that the cyp704a <dig> target gene may have undergone selection within these parental rice varieties, although additional investigations should be performed.fig.  <dig> patterns of ld blocks in two genomic regions of osa-mirf10422-akr precursors and its putative target gene, loc_os04g <dig>  a no ld blocks in the osa-mirf10422-akr region  on chromosome  <dig> were detected. b ld block in the big black block encompassing the loc_os04g <dig> region  on chromosome  <dig>  red and white spots indicate strong  and weak  ld, respectively



discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
de novo genome sequencing or re-sequencing generates the gigabytes of data that need to be analyzed at a very large scale. on the other hand, smaller subsets of snp data may be utilized for trait-marker analysis and genomic selection for breeding selection. by simplifying genomic data by using gbs, linkage and linkage disequilibrium may be cost-effectively analyzed, and deep candidate gene re-sequencing may be conducted during targeted snp detection  <cit> . the genome can be significantly simplified by restriction enzyme digestion. the snps can be detected at restriction-associated sites. a higher number of short-read alignments at regions of interest may help in more precisely resolving the real allele frequency of mutant alleles in bulked dna  <cit> . therefore, gbs may be employed for further gene fine-mapping and allele analysis.

snp markers of cyp704a <dig> gene were developed for genotyping a population consisting of  <dig> landraces, and significant mean differences in the t-test suggested that the gene may play roles in grain development. in rice, at least five proteins have been identified through quantitative genetic studies of seed size. except for the identified novel positive regulator, which is the putative serine carboxypeptidase encoded by gs <dig>  <cit> , four other proteins are required to limit final seed size and weight . in the present study, we observed the upregulation of the cyp704a <dig> gene in the short seed variety asominori, compared to the long seed variety ir <dig>  this result was in agreement with previous findings on the p <dig> gene cyp724b <dig>  <cit> . cyp724b <dig> mrna accumulated at higher levels in d <dig> mutants with shorter seeds compared to the wild-type plants  <cit> .

in addition to the cytochrome p <dig> gene, cyp724b <dig>  in rice that controls seed growth, a gene encoding the ortholog of kluh, slkluh, a p <dig> enzyme of the cyp78a subfamily in tomato , was reported to affect fruit mass and size  <cit> . here, we present evidences indicating that another rice p <dig> gene, cyp704a <dig>  was associated with seed size. interestingly, cyp704a <dig> was found and validated to be a target gene of osa-mirf10422-akr. the mechanisms on whether and how the interaction between osa-mirf10422-akr and cyp704a <dig> controls seed length require further investigation.

in conclusion, we detected a total of  <dig>  dna polymorphisms by high-throughput gbs of mapped reads by assembling these using the reference genomes of japonica nipponbare. detection of genome-wide dna polymorphisms by high-throughput gbs enabled us to identify sequence diversity derived from rice differentiation and genomic locations that were related to traits of agronomic importance. we identified polymorphic snps in the rice cytochrome p <dig> gene, cyp704a <dig>  which was targeted by a mirna gene, osa-mirf10422-akr, and associated with seed size.
