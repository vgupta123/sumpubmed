BACKGROUND
the biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate  and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate  is essential for prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. these ubiquitous compounds are utilized in the construction of numerous natural products including dolichols, sterols, terpenes and ubiquinones which contribute to myriad biological functions including hormone-based signaling, electron transport in respiration, apoptosis, meiosis and photosynthesis  <cit> . two distinct pathways have evolved to provide a pool of the precursors. in plant chloroplasts, algae, most eubacteria and apicomplexans, ipp and dmapp are synthesized through the deoxyxylulose phosphate  pathway, so named after an intermediate  <cit> . alternatively, the mevalonate  pathway supplies these precursors in eukaryotes, archaea, a few eubacteria, in the cytosol of plants and of particular interest to us parasites of the genus trypanosoma and leishmania  <cit> .

the mva pathway starts with condensation of three acetyl-coa molecules to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa , which is reduced to -mva by hmg-coa reductase. next, two kinases phosphorylate -mva to -mva 5-diphosphate. this compound is subsequently decarboxylated to ipp and ipp isomerase then produces dmapp from some of the ipp pool. the two phosphorylation steps and the decarboxylation are carried out in atp-dependent reactions by the structurally related mevalonate kinase , phosphomevalonate kinase  and mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase  respectively.

we have initiated studies of mva pathway enzymes in protozoan trypanosomatids, parasites that cause severe diseases of humans and livestock. in africa, t. brucei infection results in sleeping sickness while in south and central america, t. cruzi causes chagas' disease  <cit> . protozoans of the genus leishmania, found throughout tropical and sub-tropical areas, are responsible for cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral forms of disease  <cit> . visceral leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis are fatal if untreated and since the availability of effective drugs is limited, there is an urgent need to develop improved therapies. in support of such an effort it is important to achieve a comprehensive understanding of parasite metabolism, and to delineate aspects that are similar to the host from those that, by virtue of significant differences, might provide therapeutic opportunities.

we set out to investigate the putative assignment of mk  in trypanosomatid parasites. mk catalyzes the fourth step in the mva pathway, the transfer of the atp γ-phosphoryl onto -mva to give -mva 5-phosphate   <cit> . the enzyme is, along with galactokinase , homoserine kinase , mk and pmk, a founding member of the ghmp kinase superfamily  <cit> . family members now also include 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methylerythritol  kinase, mdd and the archaeal shikimate kinase  <cit> . structures of mk are known including the apo-structure of methanococcus jannaschii mk  and the atp bound rattus norvegicus mk   <cit> .

first it was important to prove that the putative genes do indeed encode a functional mk. assay of l. major mk  and t. brucei mk  derived from procyclic-form t. brucei show enzyme activity, and at a greatly enhanced level compared to lmmk derived from a bacterial expression system. high-resolution crystal structures of lmmk are reported and provide, for the first time, insight into the binding of substrate by any mk. there are significant structural differences at the atp- binding site compared to other ghmp kinases. consideration of previously published kinetic data on mk, derived from different species, and comparisons allows us to describe generic aspects of mk specificity and mechanism.

RESULTS
enzyme activity of lmmk and tbmk
the gene assigned as encoding a putative lmmk was cloned into an escherichia coli expression system and yielded  <dig> mg/l of purified protein. a coupled spectrophotometric assay has been successfully applied to analyze wild type and mutant mk enzymes from different species  <cit> . however, no activity was observed for recombinant lmmk using this method although the control experiment with mjmk agreed well with literature values . in a further experiment, the fluorescent atp analogue 2'-o- adenosine 5'-triphosphate  was used to investigate atp binding following an established protocol  <cit> . in the presence of lmmk, however, no enhancement in fluorescence could be detected compared to free tnp-atp indicating that the derivative does not effectively bind the recombinant lmmk . this observation is consistent with the conformation of the atp-binding site observed in the crystal structure and will be discussed later.

we considered the possibility that recombinant lmmk activity might be too low for the spectrophotometric assay and so developed a more sensitive, radioactive assay. activity of lmmk was observed after incubation of the enzyme with radiolabeled  -mva and atp. after two hours,  <dig> pmoles of the  <dig>  pmoles of  -mva present were converted to  -mva 5-phosphate, a turnover rate of  <dig> % or  <dig>  pmol/min/mg.

next, lmmk and tbmk were cloned, over expressed in procyclic-form t. brucei and immunoprecipitated  prior to undertaking the radioactive assay with each enzyme. a 100-fold lower protein concentration of lmmk and tbmk was assayed, resulting in  <dig>  pmoles and  <dig>  pmoles of substrate being transformed to product, respectively. this corresponds to turnover rates of  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % , respectively. the radioactive assays prove for the first time, an atp-dependent mk activity in leishmania and trypanosoma and therefore that the putative genes do indeed encode mk. there is a consistent level of mk activity for the enzymes isolated from procyclic-form t. brucei and these enzymes are an order of magnitude more active than the bacterially expressed enzyme. one possible explanation for this difference is that the eukaryotic protein is not optimally folded when produced in e. coli. other possibilities are that a parasite-specific factor might influence mk efficiency, for example, post-translational modification, or some associated parasite protein. alternatively, that some bacterial specific factor might compromise lmmk activity. however, we have no evidence to support post-translational modification or the presence of additional protein or small molecule species.

overall structure
recombinant lmmk and a selenomethionine  derivative produced ordered, isomorphous monoclinic crystals and a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion  experiment provided initial phase information to solve the structure. the sad approach was required because molecular replacement calculations using known mk structures failed. although the non-hydrolysable atp analogue adenosine 5'- triphosphate  and -mva were included in crystallization solutions there was no indication of ordered ligand binding. a complex was subsequently obtained by soaking crystals in higher concentrations of -mva. here, we describe the high-resolution structures of apo-semet lmmk and the binary complex of native lmmk with -mva present in one active site. crystallographic statistics are presented in table  <dig> 

there are two molecules in the asymmetric unit  related by a non-crystallographic  two-fold axis of symmetry and the surface area between the two is  <dig> Å <dig> per molecule, only 6% of the total surface area of the protein. such a low value is consistent with results from gel filtration and ultracentrifugation experiments that indicate lmmk is a monomer in solution. molecules a and b overlay with an r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å for all atoms. minor differences are observed in the conformation of the three c-terminal residues, several flexible residues at the n-terminal end of α <dig> and loop regions following β <dig> and α <dig>  molecule a of lmmk binds the substrate and overlays on the apo-enzyme molecule a with an r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å for all atoms. this indicates that there no large-scale conformational changes result from substrate binding and the molecules are so similar that it is only necessary to detail molecule a.

that lmmk presents a monomer in solution makes it different from rat and human mk, which are reported to be dimeric  <cit> . the crystal structure of the rat enzyme has a monomer in the asymmetric unit and a crystallographic two-fold axis of symmetry generates an extended dimer  <cit> . the alignment of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of lmmk is similar to that of the rat enzyme in that an extended structure results. however, the orientation of the molecules is very different .

the ghmp kinase fold and three conserved motifs
lmmk exhibits the characteristic ghmp kinase fold consisting of two domains  <cit> . the fold and the correlation of sequence and secondary structure are presented in figure  <dig>  the n-terminal domain  is formed around a six-stranded β-sheet . a small helical segment  is inserted between β <dig> and β <dig> and four helices  are positioned on one side of the β-sheet. in the ghmp family this domain is primarily responsible for atp binding. the c-terminal domain  contains an anti-parallel four-stranded β-sheet , bordering one end of the n-terminal domain β-sheet, placed on a structure created by five helices .

lmmk shares a high sequence identity with tbmk  and t. cruzi mk  and the structure of lmmk is taken to be representative of trypanosomatid mk. the identity with homologues from archaea and mammals falls below  <dig> %  and the human and rat enzymes are increased in length by about  <dig> residues. the program dali  <cit>  identified mjmk # and rnmk  as most similar structures to lmmk. the cα atoms of these structures overlay on lmmk with an r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively .

the ghmp kinase family possesses three conserved motifs that create a network of interactions to stabilize the conformation of the catalytic center   <cit> . in lmmk, motif  <dig> is β <dig> through to a short α <dig>  residues on this motif create part of the substrate-binding site and side chains of glu <dig> and his <dig> interact with the adjacent motif  <dig>  which is in the c-terminal domain. glu <dig> accepts hydrogen bonds donated from lys <dig> nz and the amide of gly <dig>  his <dig> donates a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group of thr <dig> . functional groups associated with motif  <dig>  such as the amide and hydroxyl groups of thr <dig> could interact with the γ-phosphate of atp. motif  <dig> comprises residues on β <dig> and the hairpin bend to β <dig>  residues on one side of this motif interact with motif  <dig> as explained previously; on the other side there are interactions with components of motif  <dig>  for example, lys <dig> nz and ser <dig> og participate in hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group of leu <dig> and amide of ile <dig> respectively. motif  <dig> comprises the n-terminal section of α <dig> and the preceding loop. here the polypeptide conformation aligns several main chain amides, in conjunction with the α <dig> helix dipole, to bind the anionic tail of atp in particular α- and β-phosphate groups. some of the residues within these motifs are important for substrate binding and further details will follow.

the atp-binding site of lmmk is distinct from related enzymes
a most striking difference in the arrangement of secondary structure elements in lmmk compared to other ghmp kinases occurs in the n-terminal domain adjacent to the atp binding site. this is best illustrated by the overlay of lmmk and rnmk, part of which is shown in figure  <dig>  the first four elements of lmmk secondary structure  align well on the corresponding structural features of rnmk . the structures then diverge as the mammalian mk sequence carries an insert forming a β-strand  anti-parallel to β <dig>  then an extended helix-loop-helix structure of α <dig>  a disordered flexible segment and α <dig>  a tight turn, in the vicinity of where adenine binds, then leads to α <dig>  in lmmk there is no strand equivalent to β <dig> . strand β <dig>  which is equivalent to β <dig> in rnmk, is followed by a tight turn into α <dig>  the helices α <dig>  and α <dig>  overlay well though in the parasite protein this helix is extended by two turns at the n-terminal end. the replacement of the insert and two helical segments in the rat enzyme with the short loop connecting β3-α <dig> in lmmk results in a polypeptide conformation, not observed in structures of ghmp kinases, that lies across and restricts access to the atp binding cavity . the detailed conformation of the β3-α <dig> loop in lmmk may be influenced by contacts between symmetry related molecules. this loop is beside and forming hydrogen-bonding interactions with residues at the n-terminal end of β <dig>  the c-terminal end of α <dig> and the α3–α <dig> loop of a symmetry-related molecule . once into α2/α <dig> the lmmk and rnmk structures align well and then form a strand-loop-helix structure  that serves to create the base of the atp-binding site . in lmmk this is β4-loop-α <dig>  in rnmk β7-loop-α <dig> 

in cdpme kinase  <cit>  and hsk,  <cit>  a helical insert also occurs before the α-helix equivalent to lmmk α <dig>  and similar to rnmk, is placed to configure an open atp binding site. here, cdpme kinase and hsk carry residues that bind the atp adenine in the less common syn conformation with respect to the ribose. in streptococcus pneumoniae pmk  <cit>  the polypeptide conformation also produces an open cavity into which atp binds. in this case a segment of the polypeptide around the atp-binding site is absent from the structural model due to disorder, and this implies a degree of conformational flexibility. kinetic studies with enterococcus faecalis mk indicate that gtp and ctp can also serve as substrates  <cit> . to investigate if such promiscuous substrate utilization also applied to lmmk we tested the same compounds in the enzyme assay and also by co-crystallization in the absence and presence of -mva. in the latter case, to prevent possible turnover of the substrate we used the non-hydrolysable guanosine 5'- triphosphate and cdp. despite our efforts, extending to the complete structural analysis of several diffraction datasets , we were unable to obtain a binary structure of lmmk in complex with atp, any nucleotide, or a ternary dead-end complex.

to model atp binding, the structures of lmmk and the rnmk:atp binary complex were superimposed. in the rnmk:atp complex, the adenine is anti with respect to the ribose. the β and γ-phosphoryl groups together with ser <dig> and glu <dig> coordinate a mg2+. in lmmk the modeled adenine and ribose groups clash with the side chains of tyr <dig>  lys <dig> and glu <dig> at the n-terminal end of α <dig>  arg <dig> and gln <dig> in the preceding loop region and tyr <dig> in α <dig>  these residues are positioned by a network of hydrogen bonding interactions, some mediated by water molecules. as discussed, the polypeptide conformation at the n-terminal segment of α <dig> and in the preceding loop is distinct from other mk structures and reduces access to the atp binding site. the atp-binding cavity in rnmk, in contrast, is more open and the nucleotide is embedded into an environment with significant hydrophobic character. conformational changes would have to occur, a number of hydrogen bonds would have to be disrupted and water molecules displaced to facilitate atp binding by lmmk as represented by the crystal structure.

the triphosphate moiety is placed to interact with the glycine-rich loop of the atp-binding motif  <dig> in lmmk. the β-phosphoryl group of atp most likely interacts with ser <dig> and ser <dig>  the latter a residue invariant in mk sequences, corresponding to ser <dig> in rnmk, the serine that participates in mg2+ coordination. the other residue involved in cation binding  is conserved  in lmmk and so conservation of the triphosphate positioning and interaction with mks is likely. the model positions the γ-phosphoryl group in proximity to the strictly conserved catalytic residues lys <dig> and asp <dig> of lmmk and the c <dig> hydroxyl group of substrate.

binding and recognition of mevalonate
-mva, binds in the deep cavity formed between the n-terminal and c-terminal domains, surrounded by residues on α <dig>  the n-terminal end of α <dig>  the c-terminal end of β <dig> and β <dig> and the α4–α <dig> loop . the substrate carboxylate interacts with the guanidinium of arg <dig>  which is held in place by a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of tyr <dig>  this tyrosine also forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate carboxylate and is conserved both in terms of sequence and position in rnmk . sequence comparisons of mk from other species  reveal that arg <dig>  situated on a flexible loop between β <dig> and β <dig> is conserved in some species, e.g. in tbmk and tcmk. in other sequences this loop carries asparagine, glutamine, histidine and lysine residues, which would contribute a similar role in substrate binding. the carboxylate of -mva is also linked to the side chain of ser <dig> via a water molecule. the side chains of ile <dig>  his <dig>  val <dig>  val <dig> and val <dig> in lmmk place -mva in the cavity by forming hydrophobic interactions with the substrate. the c <dig> hydroxyl group forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond to the carboxylate, which serves to stabilize the conformation of the substrate itself. this hydroxyl group accepts a hydrogen bond donated by the main chain amide of his <dig>  a component of motif  <dig>  the c <dig> methyl group is directed into a hydrophobic environment formed by the cα of thr <dig>  the side chain of his <dig>  val <dig> and val <dig>  these interactions with the c <dig> substituents serve to discriminate for -mva over -mva. the c <dig> hydroxyl, the site of phosphorylation, is directed towards lys <dig> nz at a distance of approximately  <dig> Å, in addition a water molecule provides a bridge over to asp <dig> and thr <dig> .

site-directed mutagenesis studies highlight the importance of the strictly conserved glu <dig>  his <dig> and ser <dig>  in mk. the replacement of the histidine by leucine or tyrosine significantly reduced activity of human mk whereas a lysine mutant did not fold correctly  <cit> . houten et al. reported that a his25pro mutant has no detectable mk activity  <cit> . in lmmk, the side chain of his <dig> forms hydrogen-bonding interactions to its own main chain carbonyl, via a water molecule, and to the carbonyl group of thr <dig>  a residue in motif  <dig>  in turn the side chain of thr <dig> is held in place by a hydrogen bond with thr <dig> . the preceding residue glu <dig> participates in a salt bridge interaction with lys <dig>  such interactions, help to force the main chain between glu <dig> and his <dig> into a strained conformation, with a φ/ψ combination of 75/-45°, directing the amide group towards the substrate. the corresponding histidine and glutamate residues in mjmk and rnmk are located at nearly identical positions, but there is a peptide-flip compared to lmmk so that the carbonyl not the main chain amide is directed towards the substrate-binding site. a peptide-flip does not accompany substrate binding since apo-lmmk molecules retain the strained conformation. the conformation in other mk structures may be a consequence of analyses at medium resolution. the strictly conserved glu <dig> is also important for stability. mutations of the equivalent residue in human mk  destabilize the enzyme while a glu19asp change only slightly decreased activity  <cit> . the placement of an acidic side chain to interact with the nearby lysine  is therefore beneficial for function. mutation of ser <dig>  equivalent to ser <dig> in lmmk, to alanine in human mk leads to a 100-fold decrease in binding affinity for substrate so proving an important role in substrate binding  <cit> . ser <dig> og also contributes to forming a hydrogen-bonding network, with the amide group of ala <dig> and via water molecules, to stabilize the position of the catalytic asp <dig> .

fu et al.  <cit>  and yang et al.  <cit>  modeled -mva into mjmk and rnmk respectively, and suggested a different binding mode compared to the experimentally determined complex reported here. they proposed, independently, that the substrate carboxylate interacts with an arginine  and main chain amides contributed from motif  <dig>  although the guanidinium groups of arg <dig> and arg <dig> are similarly placed in the rnmk and mjmk structures, in lmmk this is ala <dig>  the lack of conservation of an arginine at this position in mk sequences has already been discussed  <cit> .

in this section, we have described the contributions and importance of  <dig> residues to the binding of substrate in the lmmk:-mva complex either by direct or solvent mediated interactions, or by creating the binding site. these residues are depicted in figure  <dig> together with selected hydrogen bonding interactions. twelve of these residues are strictly conserved in mammalian mk sequences. the two exceptions are arg <dig>  which is equivalent to gln <dig> and is a conservative change, and thr <dig>  equivalent to ala <dig>  this high degree of conservation in the substrate-binding site suggests that the substrate is bound to mks in a similar conformation compared to -mva in lmmk.

the catalytic mechanism
knowledge of how -mva binds to lmmk provides new information concerning the molecular recognition of substrate within the enzyme active site. in combination with biochemical and kinetic data, in particular that derived from human mk  <cit> , this allows us to detail how the substrate is positioned and processed . mk carries out an ordered sequential reaction with mevalonate binding first, then atp and, following catalysis the -mva 5-phosphate is released ahead of adp product inhibition by adp is observed  <cit> .

in the lmmk:-mva complex, the substrate c <dig> hydroxyl group is directed towards the side chains of lys <dig>  and asp <dig>  as well as the γ-phosphoryl of the modeled atp . the positions of the strictly conserved lysine/aspartate pair are nearly identical in lmmk, mjmk and rnmk. in kinetic studies of human mk, no significant activity of the asp155ala and asp155asn mutants was observed and a replacement of the basic lys <dig> by methionine resulted in a 56-fold decrease of vmax in rnmk  <cit> . asp <dig> acts as a catalytic base and abstracts the proton from the c <dig> hydroxyl group of -mva to generate a potent nucleophilic alkoxide. the pka of the c <dig> hydroxyl group must be lowered in order for proton abstraction to occur, a process required to generate a nucleophilic alkoxide. presumably the basic lys <dig> is primarily responsible for lowering the pka and perhaps also stabilizing the alkoxide. once the atp is in place then the c <dig> alkoxide will attack and acquire the γ-phosphoryl group. a pentacoordinate transition state is likely and may be stabilized by lys <dig> and the presence of a divalent cation, as commonly observed in many kinases.

CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals, for the first time, mk activity in trypanosomatids. high-resolution crystal structures of lmmk have been determined and provide the first experimentally derived model for any mk in complex with mevalonate. the structure reveals how this substrate binds, the structural basis for chiral discrimination of - against -form mva and is consistent with previously published biochemical data regarding mechanism. the enzyme, not surprisingly displays the ghmp kinase fold and structural overlay indicates close similarities to rnmk for most of the structure. however, comparisons reveal a significant difference at the atp-binding site that may help explain the low activity of recombinant lmmk and our inability to obtain structural information on an atp complex. sequence comparisons suggest that the β3-α <dig> loop and α <dig> segments, including many of the hydrogen bonding interactions in lmmk are conserved in other trypanosomatid enzymes, tbmk and tcmk. as lmmk and tbmk expressed in procyclic-form t. brucei exhibit a greatly enhanced enzyme activity compared to the recombinant lmmk, it is possible that some parasite specific factor may influence the catalytic reaction and further studies are required to investigate such a hypothesis.

the high degree of conservation between trypanosomatid and mammalian mks suggests that it would be difficult to develop a small molecule that would selectively inhibit the parasite enzyme by interacting within the mevalonate-binding site. the differences observed in the atp-binding sites might be exploitable for structure-based inhibitor design but a decision would best be taken when a structure of a trypanosomatid mk in complex with atp has been determined.
