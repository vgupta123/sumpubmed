BACKGROUND
a wide variety of lesion types can affect the dna requiring the intervention of distinct and lesion-specific dna-repair mechanisms. however, it is known that repair mechanisms may complement each other in some respects by sharing many protein components  <cit> . dna double-strand breaks  induced, for instance, by ionizing radiation  and radiomimetic drugs are difficult to repair and extremely toxic although they do not occur as frequently as other types of dna lesion  <cit> . dsbs are repaired by two main mechanisms: non-homologous end-joining  and homologous recombination . nhej is the major repair mechanism in mammalian cells whereas hr is the predominant repair mechanism in budding yeast  <cit> . in nhej, dna lesions are recognized by the ku70/ <dig> heterodimer. localization of ku to sites of dsb serves to recruit other nhej proteins such as the catalytic subunit of the dna-dependent protein kinase , ligases and polymerases  <cit> . the convergence of so many proteins to sites of dna lesion is thought to protect at first the dna ends from nucleases attack and later to facilitate the repair process. dna-pkcs is a ser/thr kinase characterized by a weak activity that is significantly enhanced in the presence of double-strand dna and ku  <cit> . modulation of its activity is not exclusively regulated by the interaction with ku on dna ends. in this respect, it has been reported that dna-pkcs undergoes autophosphorylation at multiple sites, which is followed by dna-pkcs release from dsbs in vivo and loss of protein kinase activity in vitro  <cit> . the significance of these events is not fully understood, however, it has been suggested that autophosphorylation of dna-pkcs favors a conformational change that may serve to facilitate subsequent repair steps by making the dna ends more accessible for damage-responsive proteins to sites of dna damage  <cit> .

protein kinase ck <dig> is an evolutionary highly conserved ser/thr kinase composed of two catalytic subunits α and/or α' and two regulatory β-subunits  <cit> . ck <dig> is often described as a tetrameric enzyme but evidence has suggested that the individual subunits do not exist exclusively within the tetrameric complex but also as free proteins  <cit> . ck <dig> is invariably elevated in tumors and highly proliferating tissues and the de-regulated expression of the catalytic subunits is causative of transformation especially in combination with the altered expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes  <cit> . ck <dig> appears to be involved in a plethora of cellular processes including regulation of cell cycle progression, survival, proliferation and those associated with various diseases, particularly cancer, neurodegenerative- and inflammatory disorders  <cit> . current data suggest that ck <dig> plays a role in dna sensing and repair. ck <dig> has been shown to phosphorylate the scaffold protein xrcc <dig> thereby enabling the assembly and activity of dna single-strand breaks repair at sites of chromosome breakage  <cit> . moreover, this kinase has been reported to phosphorylate the n-terminal domain of the mdc <dig> adaptor protein enabling its interaction with the nbs <dig> subunit of mrn protein complex which is involved in the initial processing of dna repair  <cit> . recently, by employing dna-pkcs-proficient glioblastoma cells, we have reported evidence that sirna-mediated down-regulation of the ck <dig> catalytic subunits results in significant cell death, decreased dna-pkcs autophosphorylation at s <dig> and delayed dna repair following induction of dsbs  <cit> .

in this study, given the importance of dna-pk in dsbs repair, we have further elucidated the role of ck <dig> with respect to the molecular mechanisms activated in response to dna damage. we report for the first time evidence that ck <dig> co-localizes with phospho-histone h2ax  to sites of dsb. we show that ck <dig> associates exclusively with dna-pkcs and that the binding increases upon treatment of cells with radiomimetic drugs. furthermore, depletion of the ck <dig> catalytic subunits destabilizes the interaction of dna-pkcs with ku <dig>  which indicates that the observed decreased dna-pkcs autophosphorylation might be the consequence of lack of interaction between dna-pkcs and dna on sites of genetic lesions.

taken together, the reported observations strongly suggest that ck <dig> is required for the nhej-dependent cellular response to dsbs for an efficient repair process by stabilizing nhej proteins at sites of dna damage.

RESULTS
down-regulation of ck <dig> significantly impairs cell survival and results in persistent phosphorylation of histone h2ax
in order to investigate the role of ck <dig> in the cellular response to dna damage, human m059k glioblastoma cells were transfected with a pool of small interfering rnas  targeting the individual ck <dig> catalytic subunits  or scramble-sirna . cells incubated in the absence or presence of  <dig>  μg/ml neocarzinostatin  for  <dig> hours were analyzed by staining with anti-γ-h2ax antibody for the visualization of nuclear foci of dna damage  <cit> . the analysis revealed higher γ-h2ax signal in ck2α- and -α'-knockdown cells  with respect to cells treated with ncs alone or in combination with scramble-sirna transfection  indicative of impaired dna damage signaling. a clonogenic survival assay was subsequently performed in order to test the survival ability of cells treated as indicated in figure 1c. cells incubated with ncs and transfected with scramble-sirna displayed a 16-fold lower survival rate in comparison to cells transfected with scramble-sirna alone. on the other hand, cells exposed to ncs and transfected with sirna against ck2α or -α' showed a 3-fold lower survival rate with respect to cells transfected with scramble-sirna and incubated with ncs. overall, results indicate that ck2α- and ck2α'-knockdown cells display a similar dna damage response characterized by persistent γ-h2ax signal and lower cell survival rate in comparison to cells transfected with scramble-sirna and treated with ncs.

ck <dig> is recruited to sites of dna double-strand break
as down-regulation of the individual ck <dig> catalytic subunits resulted in impaired dna damage signaling, we investigated whether endogenous ck <dig> localizes to sites of dna damage by looking at the association with γ-h2ax. we performed in situ proximity ligation assay , which enables the detection and quantification of protein-protein interactions or proteins in close proximity in native cells  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  double staining of cells with antibodies directed against ck2α' and γ-h2ax, respectively, generated a significantly higher number of fluorescent signals  in cells treated with ncs than in control- or ck2α'-depleted cells indicating that endogenous ck <dig> co-localizes with γ-h2ax to sites of dsb. to complement results described above, we examined whether the overexpression of ck <dig> affected dna repair mechanisms induced by ncs treatment by looking at the dynamics of γ-h2ax in cells transiently expressing dsred fluorescent protein  or ck2α'-dsred. as shown in figure  <dig>  an average of  <dig> γ-h2ax foci per cell were detected in cells expressing dsred fluorescent protein  <dig> hour after addition of  <dig>  μg/ml ncs to the incubation medium while cells expressing ck2α'-dsred showed an average of  <dig> foci per cell under the same experimental conditions. after  <dig> hours from ncs treatment,  <dig> foci per cell were detected in dsred-expressing cells while  <dig> foci per cell were still present in ck2α'-dsred-expressing cells. this suggests that cells overexpressing ck <dig> display a prompt dna damage response with respect to cells expressing endogenous levels of the kinase. we performed immunofluorescence-based experiments in order to clarify whether persistent phosphorylation of histone h2ax in cells depleted of ck <dig> and treated with ncs resulted from impaired γ-h2ax dephosphorylation or dna repair defect. cells were labeled with antibodies directed against p <dig> binding protein  <dig>  which has been shown to play a key role in dna damage repair  <cit> . interestingly, we found that silencing of ck <dig> did not result in the persistence of 53bp <dig> foci as observed in cells expressing ck <dig> and exposed to ncs. these results suggest that persistent phosphorylation of histone h2ax may result from ck2-mediated dna repair defect .

down-regulation of ck <dig> regulates dna-pkcs phosphorylation in response to dna double-strand break induction
data reported above prompted us to investigate the mode by which ck <dig> contributes to dsbs repair mechanisms. we previously reported that down-regulation of the individual ck <dig> catalytic subunits causes a significant decrease in dna-pkcs autophosphorylation at ser <dig> in response to ncs treatment  <cit> . here, we extended the analysis of dna-pkcs with respect to other phosphorylation sites which were reported to be rapidly phosphorylated in vivo upon exposure to ionizing radiation  <cit> . we obtained similar results with respect to the phosphorylation status of dna-pkcs in cells transfected with scramble-sirna or sirnas against the individual ck <dig> catalytic subunits and incubated with either  <dig>  μg/ml ncs for  <dig> hour  or exposed to  <dig> gy of irradiation . the autophosphorylation of dna-pkcs at ser <dig> decreased in ck2α- and -α'-knockdown cells, respectively, following induction of dsbs as compared to control cells where only dna damage was induced. dna-pkcs is phosphorylated at multiple sites within the so-called thr <dig> cluster that is essential for efficient dsbs repair  <cit> . as atm  has been reported to phosphorylate dna-pkcs within the cluster  <cit> , we looked at dna-pkcs phosphorylation at two conserved sites, i.e. thr <dig> and thr <dig>  respectively, that are likely to be relevant in vivo  <cit> . western blot analysis showed a response similar to that observed in the case of ser <dig> phosphorylation in cells treated with ncs  or exposed to ir . however, the phosphorylation of thr <dig> did not decrease in ck2-depleted cells exposed to  <dig> gy of irradiation  as observed after ncs treatment . additional experiments were performed employing selective inhibitors of ck <dig> in order to address the question as to whether the observed ck2-mediated modulation of dna-pkcs phosphorylation was dependent on ck <dig> kinase activity. results obtained indicated that the kinase activity of ck <dig> does not regulate dna-pkcs phosphorylation upon induction of dna damage . in addition to ir exposure, dna-pkcs phosphorylation can be induced upon treatment with agents  or exposure to uv irradiation that all together cause dna replication block  <cit> . m059k cells incubated with  <dig> μm cisplatin or exposed to  <dig> j/m <dig> uv irradiation were subjected to a time-course experiment in order to determine the contribution of ck <dig> to the modulation of dna-pkcs phosphorylation upon induction of replication-stress . phosphorylation of dna-pkcs at ser <dig>  thr <dig> and thr <dig> was markedly detected at 4- <dig> hours after uv irradiation or cisplatin treatment. we compared the phosphorylation status of dna-pkcs in cells transfected with scramble-sirna or sirnas against the individual ck <dig> catalytic subunits and exposed to replication stress for  <dig> hours. as shown in figure 4d, cellular depletion of ck <dig> did not significantly alter the phosphorylation of dna-pkcs induced under replication stress. interestingly, immunostaining of cells treated essentially as indicated above with anti-γ-h2ax did not result in changes in the number of detected foci in cells expressing and lacking ck <dig> expression, respectively, .

next, in order to exclude the possibility that modulation of dna-pkcs phosphorylation by ck <dig> knockdown expression was dependent on the particular cell line utilized in the experiments, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of dna-pkcs in lysates from human h <dig> non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  induction of dsbs by cell exposure to ir or treatment with ncs resulted in marked dna-pkcs autophosphorylation at ser <dig> which was significantly reduced in ck2α- and -α'-depleted cells, respectively, as in the case of m059k glioblastoma cells. phosphorylation of dna-pkcs at thr <dig> decreased slightly in ck2-depleted cells exposed to ncs while no significant changes were observed in cells left untreated or exposed to ir. as observed in m059k cells exposed to uv irradiation or treated with cisplatin, depletion of ck <dig> in h <dig> cells did not affect the phosphorylation levels of dna-pkcs with respect to control experiments. overall, results reported here indicate that the ability of ck <dig> to modulate the phosphorylation of dna-pkcs occurs specifically in response to direct induction of dsbs and it is independent from the type of cells employed.

lack of ck <dig> destabilizes the association of dna-pkcs with ku80
down-regulation of ck <dig> leads to decreased dna-pkcs autophosphorylation suggesting that ck <dig> either favors the interaction between dna-pkcs molecules for their mutual phosphorylation in trans or mediates the association of dna-pkcs with ku in the presence of dna. as chen et al.,  <cit>  demonstrated that the phosphorylation of dna-pkcs at ser <dig> occurs directly between two kinase molecules, we hypothesized that the observed decreased autophosphorylation of dna-pkcs in ck2-depleted cells was caused by defective recruitment of dna-pkcs to sites of dna damage. therefore, we examined whether the interaction between dna-pkcs and ku <dig>  whose expression levels do not vary in cells depleted of ck <dig>  <cit> , was affected in ck2-sirna-transfected cells. as shown in figure 6a, immunoprecipitation experiments performed with an antibody directed against dna-pkcs revealed a marked decrease in dna-pkcs/ku <dig> association in cells depleted of ck2α/α'. similar results were obtained by performing in situ pla  where we looked at the association between dna-pkcs and ku <dig> directly in m059k cells treated or not with ncs. here, we reported a ~50% decrease in the number of fluorescent signals in cells depleted of ck <dig> and exposed to ncs compared to control experiment where cells were transfected with scramble-sirna and treated with ncs.

to address the question of whether ck <dig> interacts with dna-pkcs and/or ku <dig>  we used whole lysates from hct <dig> and m059k cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments employing antibodies directed against ck2α. as shown in figure 7a, ck2α/α' co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous dna-pkcs in control cells and the association increased following induction of dsbs by ncs treatment. however, we did not detect any association with ku <dig> protein . moreover, the analysis of cells left untreated or incubated with ncs did not show changes in the expression levels of both proteins . in order to complement results obtained by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we performed in situ pla employing m059k and m059j cells and looked at the association between ck2α' and either dna-pkcs or ku <dig> in cells treated with ncs. as shown in figure 7b and 7c, we confirmed the interaction between dna-pkcs and ck2α' in m059k cells as previously reported  <cit> . as expected, a very low number of fluorescent signals was detected in m059j cells. next, we looked at fluorescent signals deriving from in situ pla performed employing antibodies directed against ku <dig> and ck2α', respectively. interestingly, the analysis of m059k cells revealed an average of ~ <dig> positive signals per cell but this number was drastically reduced to ~ <dig> positive signals per cell in m059j cells suggesting that ck2α' does not interact directly with ku <dig>  the evidence that ck <dig> interacts with dna-pkcs, prompted us to define the dna-pkcs-region responsible for the interaction with ck <dig>  interaction studies were performed with human recombinant ck2α and a panel of myc-tagged dna-pkcs deletion fragments covering extensively the amino acid sequence of dna-pkcs and transiently expressed in cos- <dig> cells . experiments of co-immunoprecipitation performed employing anti-myc antibody, revealed that two dna-pkcs fragments, i.e. fragments c and -d comprising amino acid residues 2005- <dig> and 2768- <dig>  respectively, interact specifically with ck2α . analysis of protein sequences preceding fragment a as myc-fusions has not been possible due to difficulties in expressing n-terminal fragments.

discussion
nhej is the predominant repair pathway in mammalian cells that is activated in the presence of dsbs and requires the intervention of the dna-pk complex for an adequate damage response. although the importance of dna-pkcs in dsb repair is well established and has been extensively studied, the precise mechanism by which this enzyme localizes to sites of dsb, phosphorylates itself and other repair proteins to promote nhej is still elusive. in this study, we report evidence that protein kinase ck <dig> contributes significantly to the dna-pkcs-mediated cellular response to dna damage. lack of ck <dig> leads to marked cell death, persistent dna damage and reduced survival rate in cells treated with radiomimetic drugs. we show that endogenous ck <dig> co-localizes with γ-h2ax to sites of dna damage and its overexpression results in rapid decrease in the number of detected nuclear foci. this suggests that ck <dig> plays an important role in the dna damage response. experiments of co-immunoprecipitation and in situ pla led to the observation that lack of ck <dig> destabilizes the ku80/dna-pkcs complex formation. these findings might explain the delayed dna repair observed in cells lacking ck <dig> and, because survival of cells exposed to genotoxic stress is largely dependent on efficient repair of dsbs, the low clonogenic survival observed in ck2-depleted cells. the reported lack of association between ku <dig> and dna-pkcs in ck2-knockdown cells suggested that ck <dig> might mediate their interaction. however, we showed that endogenous ck <dig> binds to dna-pkcs and the association is enhanced in response to dna damage but we could not detect the presence of ku <dig> in the complex formation. this has led to the hypothesis that ck <dig> interacts exclusively with dna-pkcs facilitating and/or stabilizing the binding of the latter to dna which has been reported to be weak  <cit> . in support of this notion, results obtained by in situ pla where the binding of dna-pk to chromatin components  was tested in cells exposed to ncs, show that the association between dna-pkcs and histone h <dig> is attenuated in cells lacking ck <dig> . data derived from the co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in situ pla  suggest that ck <dig> binds exclusively dna-pk. in this respect, the high level of fluorescent signal detected in m059k cells, which would indicate that ck2α' is also associated with ku <dig>  is almost completely suppressed in dna-pkcs-deficient m059j cells. the association between ck <dig> and dna-pkcs does not seem to be strictly dependent upon dsbs induction since we detected association also in the absence of dna damage although to a lesser extent. this has been previously reported in interaction studies between mediator of dna damage checkpoint protein  <dig>  and nbs <dig> subunit of mrn comlex  <cit> . here, the authors showed that the ck2-mediated phosphorylation of the std-repeats of mdc <dig> enhances the binding to nbs <dig> thereby promoting the local concentration and/or stability of dna damage regulators at sites of genetic lesions. mdc <dig> has also been shown to regulate dna-pk autophosphorylation  <cit> . our studies  <cit>  indicate that it is not the catalytic activity of ck <dig> but rather the protein itself that regulates the interaction of dna-pkcs with dna at sites of damage underlining the multiplicity of the effects exerted by ck <dig>  in light of the fact that ck <dig> might facilitate the binding of dna-pkcs to dna upon induction of dsbs, we believe that the apparent low phosphorylation levels of dna-pkcs at s <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> in ck2-depleted cells  might be caused by defective recruitment of dna-pkcs to sites of dna damage.

dna-pkcs phosphorylation at t <dig> in cells lacking ck2α or -α' and exposed to ionizing radiation did not lead to results similar to those obtained with cells treated with ncs . currently, the reason for this discrepancy is not clear as both types of treatment generate dsb. however, t <dig> is reported to be phosphorylated by all three members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-like family of protein kinases  and possibly other kinases  <cit> , whose kinetic of phosphorylation might be differently regulated upon exposure of cells to ir or treatment with radiomimetic drugs. however, one cannot exclude that lack of chromatin remodeling may occur in ck <dig> deficient cells and lead to defective dna-pk phosphorylation and other effects. in this respect, it has been shown that ck <dig> is implicated in chromatin remodeling by controlling the mobilization of hp1-beta through modulation of its phosphorylation at thr <dig>  <cit> .

through experiments of mapping protein-protein interactions in vitro we defined two regions in dna-pkcs responsible for the association with ck2α comprised between amino acid residues 2005- <dig>  and 2768- <dig> . it is conceivable that amino acids between these two regions which comprise the so-called abcde cluster of in vivo phosphorylation sites  <cit>  are also involved in the interaction with ck <dig>  it remains to be addressed whether the phosphorylation of these amino acids are affected upon binding of ck <dig> to dna-pkcs. fragment d comprises part of the so-called fat domain, which is conserved in pikks and seems to regulate pikks kinase activity  <cit> . part of the fat domain comprises a high-affinity ku binding . fragment e includes part of this ku binding sequence. however, no interaction was found with ck <dig> suggesting that the association of dna-pkcs with ku and ck <dig>  respectively, involves different domains.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we show for the first time that protein kinase ck <dig> co-localizes with γ-h2ax to sites of genetic lesions and modulation of its expression levels affects the cellular dna damage response. ck <dig> interacts with dna-pkcs in mammalian cells in the absence of dna damage and the association increases upon cell treatment with radiomimetic drugs. in vitro studies employing a panel of dna-pkcs fragments and human recombinant ck2α show that the interaction is direct although one cannot exclude that the complex formation between ck <dig> and native, full length dna-pkcs might occur in the presence of other dna repair proteins and dna. evidence suggests that ck <dig> might facilitate and/or stabilize the binding of dna-pkcs and possibly other proteins of nhej, to dna ends contributing to efficient dna damage repair. additional experiments are necessary to further dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in nhej, nevertheless, the present findings point to ck <dig> as a prominent novel signaling kinase regulating dna-pkcs fate in cells exposed to ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs.
