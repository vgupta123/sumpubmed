BACKGROUND
wingless and transforming growth factor beta  signaling are two cell-cell signaling systems that are well conserved throughout the animal kingdom and that control a plethora of processes ranging from embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation and migration, to tissue homeostasis, stem cell behavior, tissue regeneration and cancer  <cit> . dact  proteins have been identified in mammals, chicken, frog and zebrafish as intracellular multi-adapter molecules with the ability to modulate and possibly integrate the wnt and tgfβ signaling cascades. this ability primarily relies on the physical interaction of dact proteins with dvl , ckiδ/ϵ, vangl, pka, pkc, which are players in the various wnt pathways, or with the alk4/ <dig> tgfβ receptors  <cit> . in line with these properties, dact proteins positively as well as negatively regulate the wnt/β-catenin pathway and positively regulate the wnt/pcp pathway . in addition, specifically dact <dig> has been implicated in the suppression of tgfβ-dependent wound healing and nodal-dependent mesoderm induction due to its ability to facilitate lysosomal degradation of alk <dig>  <cit> . in addition to these established roles, dact proteins have been shown to stabilize p <dig> catenin  which in turn sequesters the transcriptional repressor kaiso, thus leading to the activation of kaiso targets  <cit> . since the p120-dact interaction is stimulated by wnt and is mediated by dvl, and because many kaiso targets are also tcf/lef targets, the p <dig> catenin/kaiso pathway is seen as a parallel pathway to the wnt/β-catenin pathway. dact proteins have been shown to also modulate wnt signaling mediators in a ligand-independent fashion: dact proteins shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and can block nuclear β-catenin function by disrupting β-catenin/lef <dig> complexes and enhancing lef1-hdac interaction  <cit> . however, they can also promote tcf/lef function when the dact n-terminal domain interacts with these transcription factors  <cit> . in addition, dact proteins can interact with dbf <dig> which, independent from its role in cell cycle regulation, inhibits β-catenin targets  <cit> . finally, dact function has been shown to depend on its phosphorylation state which is controlled in two ways: firstly, in the absence of wnt, dact is unphosphorylated, binds to dvl and blocks its ability to protect β-catenin from phosphorylation, thus promoting β-catenin degradation. in the presence of wnt, ckiδ/ϵ not only phosphorylates dvl but also dact; this decreases their affinity and promotes the resolution of β-catenin destruction complex, thereby stabilizing β-catenin. it also allows dact to promote the function of tcf/lef molecules, thus further enhancing the wnt response  <cit> . secondly, cyclic amp activated pka phosphorylates dact; this allows the binding of 14-3-3β which also blocks the ability of dact to promote dvl degradation, thus enhancing wnt signal transduction  <cit> . taken together, dact proteins have emerged as nodal points in the simultaneous control of the various wnt and tgfβ signaling pathways.

dact are modular proteins, using different structural domains to interact with their specific partners. the functions of some of these domains have already been characterized. a leucine zipper located in the n-terminal half of the protein is required for homo-and hetero-dimerization, a c-terminal pdz binding domain together with a domain located in the center of the protein is crucial for dvl binding, a serine-rich domain upstream of the pdz binding domain is required for the interaction with vangl <dig>  the sequences encoded by the first three and the start of the fourth exon are sufficient to inhibit alk <dig>  a region encoded by the end of the 3rd and start of the 4th exon has been implicated in tcf <dig> binding and a not well characterized central portion of the protein interacts with p <dig> catenin  <cit> . furthermore, nuclear export and import signals have been identified  <cit> . however, in vitro binding studies showed that binding affinity and specificity of dact proteins with their various partners is variable, with mouse dact <dig> being the only dact showing significant affinity to tcf/lef and alk <dig> and, in comparison to dact <dig> and dact <dig>  weak binding to vangl <dig>  <cit> . knock out studies in the mouse implicated dact <dig> in wnt/pcp and dact <dig> in tgfβ signaling, yet morpholino knockdown experiments in zebrafish implicated dact <dig> in wnt/β-catenin and dact <dig> in wnt/pcp signaling  <cit> . this indicates that the structure-function relationship of dact proteins is still unclear.

a key factor in our limited understanding of dact function is the fact that the full complement of dact genes available in different animals to regulate wnt and tgfβ signaling is not known, and therefore, dact functions may have been overlooked or misinterpreted due to gene redundancy. moreover, dact genes have so far only been found in bony vertebrates. however, bony vertebrates together with cartilaginous vertebrates belong to the infraphylum of jawed vertebrates, and in the ancestors of this animal group the genome has been duplicated twice, followed by subsequent gene loss or gene diversification  <cit> . thus, the origin of dact genes and their evolutionarily basic function is not known. to unravel the original and derived roles of dact genes and proteins, we took an evolutionary approach. we searched for so far elusive dact family members in the animal kingdom, and, using bioinformatic tools, we determined their phylogeny. moreover, we searched for conserved amino acid stretches that may serve as functional domains. finally, we determined the expression of dact genes in the zebrafish, the organism with the highest number of dact genes, in comparison with that of the chicken, which has only two.

our study shows that dact genes are unique to chordates. in jawed vertebrates, four distinct dact paralogs were identified, with dact <dig> and dact <dig> originating from one, dact <dig> and dact <dig> from the second dact gene that was present after 1r. remarkably, all four genes are still present in latimeria , turtles  as well as lizards and snakes , but mammals, birds and amphibians have independently lost particular dact genes. in most teleosts, a dact <dig>  dact <dig>  two dact <dig> and one dact <dig> gene have been kept; zebrafish and the spotted gar, a holost fish, have an additional, intronless and hence possibly retrotranscribed dact4r. motif comparison suggests that the ability to dimerize, shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus, bind tcf/lef and vangl molecules and to interact with various kinases may have been already present in the ancestral dact protein. the ability to interact with alk <dig> may have evolved with dact <dig> and  <dig>  motif combinations in extant dact <dig> proteins suggest that these molecules may sequester dact binding partners, thereby inhibiting their function. significantly, the various dact genes show similar expression patterns, suggesting that in a given tissue, the regulation of wnt and tgfβ signaling will depend on the combinatorial action of dact proteins.

RESULTS
searches for dact genes in the animal kingdom
identification of new members of the gnathostomedact gene family
currently, three dact family members are known in mouse and humans, two dact genes have been identified in the chicken, one in xenopus  and two in the zebrafish  <cit> . in order to obtain a comprehensive overview of dact genes in jawed vertebrates , we searched the genomes of various lobe-finned/lobe-limbed  and ray-finned  bony vertebrates. in our search we also included the genomic database for the elephant shark, a cartilaginous  vertebrate. to perform these searches, we interrogated the ensembl and ncbi databases using the known human, mouse, chicken, xenopus laevis and zebrafish dact protein sequences as queries. moreover, we performed searches with protein sequences encoded by individual exons or we used known dact protein motifs. since some of the selected genomes are not fully characterized, we also used the query sequences to interrogate the ncbi expressed sequence tags  database for the aforementioned groups, for additional bony vertebrates and for the spiny dogfish shark, pacific electric ray and little skate . the organisms searched in this study are listed in additional file 1; the accession numbers of sequences are provided in additional file  <dig>  the results of our searches are shown in figure  <dig> 

the searches revealed that like mouse and humans, all mammals carried three dact genes and all birds had two. in amphibians, we discovered a previously not recognized dact gene, increasing the complement of dact genes in these animals to two as well. remarkably, four distinct dact genes were found in lizards and snakes, in turtles and in the coelacanth, while five dact genes were present in the gar as well as in the tilapia, medaka and the atlantic cod, six in zebrafish, four in the stickleback and in pufferfish. these newly discovered genes indicate that the gnathostome dact gene family is larger than previously anticipated. in order to ensure that all gnathostome dact family members were traced, we repeated the searches, using the newly discovered sequences as queries. these searches, however, did not produce any further hits and confirmed the earlier results.

based on similarities in sequence and organization, the dact genes identified in sarcopterygians and actinopterygians fell into four paralog groups. matching sequences for all four paralog groups were found in chondrichthyans, indicating that four dacts genes were present in the ancestral gnathostome genome. the first group encompassed known dact <dig> sequences and their newly identified relatives. dact1-type proteins consisted of 800-850aa with  <dig> % overall sequence identity; they were encoded by three small and a 4th, large exon. sequences of this type were found in all gnathostomes with the exception of pufferfish. in all species, only a single dact <dig> gene was present . a second set of sequences was 750-850aa long with overall  <dig> % sequence identity and encompassed known and novel dact <dig> proteins. the dact <dig> genes showed the same intron-exon structure as dact <dig> genes, however the third exon was almost twice as long as the 3rd exon in dact <dig>  dact2-type sequences were found in all gnathostomes with the exception of amphibians. similar to dact <dig>  only a single dact2-type gene was found in a given species. the third set of sequence encompassed both previously and newly identified dact <dig> proteins which were present in all gnathostomes with the exception of birds. in teleosts, two distinct sets of dact <dig> genes were found, designated dact3a and dact3b; a possible exception is the stickleback where due to gaps in the genomic sequence and absence of dact3b ests, the presence of this gene could not be ascertained. the dact <dig> proteins showed significant length variations, ranging from  <dig> , 540– <dig> , 610– <dig>  to 820aa . given that the dact family was thought to consist of three members only  <cit> , we were surprised to find a fourth, distinct set of sequences. dact <dig> proteins encompassed some  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or up to 1070-1120aa . like most dacts, dact <dig> proteins were encoded by genes containing four exons. the exception was a second gar and zebrafish dact <dig> protein which stems from an intronless gene that possibly was retrotranscribed and hence was named dact4r. remarkably, dact4genes were present in chondrychthians, in actinopterygians and in the following sarcopterygians: latimeria, anapsid and diapsid reptiles. this suggests that the dact <dig> gene belongs to the original gnathostome dact repertoire and persisted well beyond the actinopterygian-sarcopterygian split, the coelacanth-tetrapod split, the amphibian-amniote split and the segregation of the amniote lineages, but was lost independently in the avian, mammalian and amphibian lineages. since both the gar and the zebrafish have dact4r genes, this suggests that the gene occurred before the teleost-specific, third genome duplication   <cit> , but in most teleosts it was eliminated together with the duplicate of the genuine dact <dig> gene.

identification of cyclostome dact genes
given that we found dact genes well-represented in all gnathostome lineages, we wondered whether cyclostomes that split from gnathostomes some  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  might also carry these genes. we therefore searched the ensembl and ncbi databases for dact family members in the two cyclostome genomes available . as queries, we used full-length, exon-specific or motif-specific sequences from all four gnathostome dact proteins. the search revealed several contigs with dact-like sequences in the lethenteron genome and also in the petmar <dig> version of the sea lamprey genome. when the current version of the sea lamprey genome  was released, however, all except the sequences previously located on contig  <dig>  now gl <dig>  had been removed. yet several of the original petromyzon contigs encoded conserved dact motifs in the correct order, they had highly similar counterparts in the lethenteron genome, and some sequences were also represented in ests. we therefore considered these sequences as trustworthy. the results are included in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

the analysis of the lamprey genome and est sequences indicated the existence of at least four dact-related genes in cyclostomes . for two of these genes, sequences corresponding to all four dact gene exons were located on single contigs in lethenteron . partial matches for both genes were found in the petromyzon genome . for dactc, only exons 2– <dig> were identified on contig ke <dig>  sequences with high similarity to exon <dig> of dactc were found on two more lethenteron contigs , but not in the petromyzon genome. contig ke <dig> of lethenteron contained exon <dig> of the dactd gene, also represented in petmar <dig> c <dig>  in addition, identical, likely exon <dig> sequences were found on contigs apjl <dig> and apjl <dig>  since these sequences were not contiguous with the dactc or dactd sequences, they could not be unambiguously assigned to either gene.

while the four cyclostome dact genes displayed similarity with the other vertebrate dacts, they could not be clearly allocated to any of the gnathostome dact paralog groups.

identification of invertebrate dact genes
to trace the so far elusive origin of dact genes, we next searched the ensembl and ncbi genome and est collections for oikopleura dioica, ciona intestinalis, ciona savignyi , branchiostoma floridae , saccoglossus kowalevskii  and strongylocentrotus purpuratus . these are all deuterostome animals. in addition, we searched the sequences available for the following protostomes: aplysia californica, a mollusc representing lophotrochozoans; drosophila melanogaster, tribolium castaneum, bombyx mori  and c. elegans, c. briggsae and loa loa . finally, we interrogated the ncbi protist and fungi genomes. the searches were performed as before, using full length or exon-specific dact protein sequences or protein motifs as queries.

our results revealed that the only invertebrate harboring dact sequences was the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae, the florida lancelet . here, the blast hits matched with exons 8– <dig> of a predicted 10-exon cdna on a single scaffold . exons 1– <dig> were confirmed by ests, encoding however the lancelet homologue of the rpa <dig> gene. exons 8– <dig> were confirmed by two further sets of ests. the first set encompassed exon <dig>   <dig> and start to mid-exon <dig>  the second set carried middle and end of exon <dig>  yet there are no ests to suggest that exons 1– <dig> are linked in a transcript. moreover, as will be shown below, exons 8– <dig> carry the complete sequence for a dact gene. we therefore renamed the exons that belong to branchiostoma dact exons <dig> , <dig>  exon <dig> encoded 73aa with loose homology to exon <dig> derived sequences in vertebrate dacts. exon <dig> accounted for 58aa that aligned well with exon2-derived sequences of gnathostome dact1- <dig>  including a 5x leucine zipper. different to vertebrates, however, the branchiostoma exon2- <dig> boundary encoded an extended serine-rich stretch. exon <dig> encoded in total 872aa that encompassed a number of the conserved sequence motifs which in vertebrates are encoded by the 3’ end of exon <dig>  and by exons  <dig> and  <dig>  taken together, we traced the origin of dacts back to chordates, where many motifs and functional domains were established already.

phylogenetic analysis of dact protein sequences
the initial sequence analysis of the known and the newly identified dact sequences suggested that until recently, both sarcopterygian and actinopterygian vertebrates had four distinct dact genes that were generated during the second genome duplication in vertebrate evolution   <cit> . to further corroborate this finding and to determine which of the dact genes are more related and hence, originated from a common ancestor, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis of dact proteins, using maximum likelihood and bayesian methods . to ensure that the major chordate taxa are represented, we focused on sequences from humans, opossum, chicken, anole lizard, the western painted turtle, xenopus tropicalis, coelacanth, spotted gar, zebrafish, fugu, tilapia and branchiostoma that were full length or near full length; in addition we included the partial sequences from the elephant shark, and the complete and partial sequences from the two cyclostomes, dacta-d from petromyzon and lethenteron. we used an unbiased approach, i.e. an unrooted tree . likelihood mapping shows that  <dig> % of quartets were fully resolved , indicating the sequences were suitable for phylogenetic reconstruction.

in the tree, the gnathostome sequences were placed into four distinct groups . within the dact <dig> group, the dact <dig>  3a and 3b sequences formed the expected subgroups. likewise, the gar and zebrafish dact4r sequences formed a subgroup within the dact <dig> group. thus the phylogenetic tree analysis supports our dact1- <dig> group allocations. within the individual dact groups, sarcopterygian and actinopterygian dact sequences formed subgroups, particularly evident in the rooted trees . the position of the elephant shark sequences was less clear, possibly because these sequences are incomplete. interestingly, in the unrooted tree and the rooted trees, the gnathostome dact <dig> and dact <dig> sequences formed a meta-group. the gnathostome dact <dig> and dact <dig> sequences formed a second metagroup, evident in the maximum likelihood and bayesian trees . the division into the dact1/ <dig> and dact2/ <dig> groups was highly significant in the likelihood mapping analysis  and well supported in the phyml tree for gnathostome sequences . this suggests that of the two dact genes created in 1r, one gave rise to dact <dig> and  <dig>  the other to dact <dig> and  <dig> genes.

in the maximum likelihood and bayesian phylogenetic trees for all vertebrate sequences , the cyclostome sequences were grouped together, separated from the gnathostome dacts. the quartet puzzling tree , however, shows a star-like topology for this node, and consequently the evolutionary relationship of cyclostome and gnathostome genes cannot be determined with certainty.

organization and relationship of gnathostome dact gene loci
our study revealed novel gnathostome dact sequences that were allocated to four paralog groups, based on the combination of aa sequence features and the phylogenetic analysis. to further corroborate this allocation, we analyzed the organization of vertebrate dact genomic loci, reasoning that dact orthologs would reside in syntenic genomic regions. for our analysis, we focused on representative sarcopterygian and actinopterygian species with reasonably well characterized genomes. we first determined the localization of a given dact gene, performing a blast search on the ensembl database. we then established the order of neighboring genes in a 1–2 mb radius , exploiting the ensembl gene annotations or performing blast-searches for these genes. during this process, we noticed that, following inversions and other forms of recombination events, genes associated with a particular dact gene in sarcopterigians often had been placed at a distance in actinopterygians, and vice versa. we therefore also established the wider environment of dact genes .

dact <dig> loci
genes assigned to the dact <dig> group were invariably linked with timm <dig>  arid4a, psma <dig> . in the gar, talpid <dig> and irf2bpl were found between dact <dig> and timm9; the two genes were also next to dact <dig> in tilapia or on either side of dact <dig> in the zebrafish. in all other organisms, either talpid <dig>  or irf2bpl  was located betweentimm <dig> and dact <dig>  in sarcopterygians as well as in the gar, on the side facing away from the psma3-talipd3/irf2bpl group, dact <dig> was associated with daam <dig> and gpr <dig>  in teleosts, this position was held by fbxo <dig> and tbpl <dig>  which in sarcopterygians were part of a gene group linked to psma <dig>  outside the immediate 1 mb radius around dact <dig>  numerous additional genes were found both in the wider environment of sarcopterygian as well as actinopterygian dact <dig> . thus, although there is some variation in the arrangement of dact <dig> loci, the same genes were associated with dact <dig> in sarcopterygians and actinopterygians. of these genes, psma <dig>  timm <dig> and talpid <dig> are single genes without any paralogs. hence, they serve as unique identifiers of the dact <dig> locus, and support our assignment of genes to the dact <dig> group.

dact <dig> loci
as amphibians lack a dact <dig> gene and latimeria dact <dig> was on a too short a contig, information on sarcopterygian dact <dig> loci was restricted to amniotes. however, in amniotes as well as in the gar, genes allocated to the dact <dig> group were associated with frmd <dig> on one side and smoc <dig> on the other; in teleosts, smoc <dig> was also always present . thbs <dig> and wdr <dig>  linked to smoc <dig> in amniotes, were within 1 mb distance of dact <dig> in the gar and only slightly more distant in teleosts . similarly, the map4k3-agpat <dig> group was found in the wider environment of all dact <dig> genes, and the sipa1l2-irf2pb2-gng <dig> group was in the wider environment of bird, reptile and actinopterygian dact <dig> . as for dact <dig>  numerous additional genes populated the dact <dig> environment both in amniotes as well as in actinopterygians. moreover, wdr <dig>  and in amniotes phf <dig> and mllt <dig>  are unique and serve as locus identifiers, suggesting that we allocated dact <dig> orthologs correctly. in teleosts, a number of genes are linked with dact <dig> that are not found in the dact <dig> environment of the gar, suggesting that they invaded the locus after the split from the holost lineage . remarkably, traces of dact <dig> locus can still be found in xenopus, since a number of dact <dig> associated genes are well preserved on contig gl <dig> 

dact <dig> loci
for the genes assigned to the dact <dig> group, only limited information was available for platypus and latimeria . in all other animals, dact <dig> genes were accompanied by vasp, snrpd <dig>  dmpk, pglyrp and c5ar , vasp, snrpd <dig>  pglyrp and c5ar , or vasp, dmpk . the prkd2-fkrp-arhgap <dig> group that is closely linked to amniote dact <dig> is found in the wider environment of gar dact <dig> and teleost dact3a, while a duplicated copy of the argap <dig> gene is found in the environment of teleost dact3b. similarly, genes like rtn <dig>  akt <dig> polr2i, opa <dig>  ppp5corsae1are found in the wider environment of all dact <dig> genes, with polr2i, opa <dig>  snrpd <dig>  fkrp and sae <dig> being unique, and ppp5c and c5ar <dig> having no paralogs linked to other dact genes. thus, even though the precise order of genes differs between gnathostome groups and a number of signature genes have disappeared from the teleost dact3b locus, all loci are recognizable as related, supporting our assignment of genes to the dact <dig> group. a set of genes was only found at teleost dact <dig> loci, yet these were present both at the dact3a and 3b locus. this indicates that the teleost dact3a and dact3b genes arose from the teleost-specific 3r  <cit> . in birds, however, almost all of the dact <dig> associated genes were absent, suggesting that the entire locus has been lost.

dact <dig> loci
as shown above, dact4-type genes were only found in anapsid and diapsid reptiles, in latimeria and in actinopterygians, and the sequences of the sarcopterygian and actinopterygian proteins were rather divergent. yet dact <dig> genes were invariably linked with ttc <dig>  and in most cases, also with map1lc3c . in reptiles and the gar, ttc <dig> was adjoined by hnrnpul <dig>  which was located in the dact <dig> environment in teleosts. in the sarcopterygians, map1lc3c was linked with zbtb <dig> and polr2g, which populated the environment of actinopterygian dact <dig> genes . bscl <dig> was located within the 1 mb environment of all dact <dig> genes, and in the gar and teleosts , also rom <dig> was close by. in acanthopterygian teleosts, the dact <dig> environment showed a stereotype arrangement, and most of the genes found here were also found in the environment of the zebrafish, gar, coelacanth and reptile dact <dig>  of the genes associated with dact <dig> loci, bscl <dig>  ints <dig>  polr2g and stx <dig> are unique and therefore, identify this site. thus, even though the order of genes at dact <dig> loci was not always preserved, the loci, and by extension the genes and proteins were closely related. searching for dact <dig> associated genes in vertebrates that have lost dact <dig>  we noticed that the locus was very well-conserved in mammals and in amphibians, suggesting that their dact <dig> genes disappeared as a result of only a small deletion and possibly recently. in contrast, in birds only a few dispersed genes formerly associated with dact <dig> were present, suggesting a major chromosome rearrangement that resulted in the loss of the entire locus. the intronless dact4r gene found in the gar and zebrafish, however, was not accompanied by any genes linked to the original dact <dig>  yet, the dact4r loci closely resembled each other. this suggests that the dact4r gene was present in the ancestor of holosts and teleosts before the teleost 3r, but was shed from most teleost genomes thereafter.

phylogenetic analysis of dact-associated sequences
our synteny analysis revealed a number of dact-associated genes specific for a particular dact locus. however, we also found a number of genes with paralogs at several dact loci, suggesting that they were part of the dact locus before the gnathostome 2r. we therefore expected that, if our phylogeny analysis of the dacts were correct, the dact associated sequences would show the same phylogenetic relationships. to test this, we scanned the environment of dact genes for genes that have four paralogs in all vertebrates, each associated with a particular dact locus, making allowances for teleost genes that, after 3r were kept at the locus that since has shed the duplicated dact gene. these criteria applied to ehd1-4; eml1-4; fos, fosb, fosl <dig>  fosl2; mark1-4; rtn1- <dig> and sipa <dig>  sipa1l <dig>  1 l <dig>  1 l <dig> . interestingly, a sipa <dig> homologue was found associated with dacta, and an eml homologue close to dactb in the lethenteron genome . we next extracted the protein sequences encoded by these genes, and wherever possible, the corresponding lamprey, branchiostoma, tunicate or drosophila sequences, and, using the drosophila sequences as outgroups, we constructed phylogenetic trees . notably, the trees obtained for the dact-associated genes always grouped the dact1/ <dig> and dact2/ <dig> associated genes; the other possible permutations  were never observed. this supports the idea that during the vertebrate 2r dact1-dact <dig> arose from one, dact2-dact <dig> from the other dact precursor.

analysis of structural motifs in the dact protein groups
dacts have been attributed a range of functions in intracellular signaling pathways, all relying on their interaction with other proteins. the ability to interact with partners resides in distinct structural motifs. the identification of a whole family of distinct dact paralogs raises the possibility that different dacts specialize in specific functions, and that this may be reflected in their repertoire of motifs. we hence investigated the exon-intron structure of dact genes, and we investigated the presence and distribution of known protein motifs, searched for the presence of further conserved aa stretches and used the psort and netnes  <dig>  programs to predict functionally relevant motifs. for the ease of comparison, motifs were numbered consecutively; where protein motifs were composed of several linked elements, these were labeled with letters in alphabetical order. the identity matrix for the most conserved regions is included in additional file  <dig>  presence and linear distribution of the motifs is shown in figure 4; the sequences of short motifs are summarized in additional file  <dig>  motifs and longer conserved stretches are indicated in the full alignments of dact orthologs  as well as in the gnathostome dact sequence logos . our approach revealed novel sequence motifs typical for all dact proteins. significantly, we also identified motifs and sequence variations that distinguish dact orthologs and that, even in individual species with six dact genes, assigned them to the four paralog groups.

dact1-type sequences
conserved stretches of aa in the dact- <dig> type proteins included a putative nuclear export signal encoded by the centre of exon  <dig> , a series of linked elements spanning the 3’ end of exon <dig>  exon <dig> and the 5’ end of exon <dig>  which included a 6x leucine zipper required for homo-and heterodimerization  <cit>  and a nuclear export signal  <cit> , and in comparison to dact <dig> a reduced set of elements encoded by the exon3/ <dig> border . exon  <dig> continued with sequence motifs 4a,b, 5a-c; functionally, the region encompassing motifs 3c-5b has been implicated in tcf <dig> binding; the region encompassing motifs 5b,c was shown to participate in dvl binding  <cit> . following a variable portion, further conserved aa stretches  including a nuclear localization signal  <cit> were recognizable, with motif 7a and the specific sequence of the 10th motif only occurring in this protein group. the last 200aa with motif elements 11a-g were again highly conserved  and encompassed a further putative nuclear localization signal, the known vangl binding domain and the c-terminal pdz binding domain  <cit> .

dact2-type sequences
in the dact <dig> proteins, exon  <dig> encoded a distinct version of motif  <dig>  which was followed by the exon1- <dig> spanning domain that had  <dig> % identity, contained motifs 2a-f, a 6x leucine zipper and the nuclear export signal. yet the specific sequence of motif 2f was distinct from the corresponding sequence in dact <dig> proteins. the 3’ end of exon  <dig> encoded two sets of sequences  that both resembled dact <dig> motif 3b, indicating that they may have arisen from an internal duplication. exon  <dig> contributed to a specific version of motif 3c, followed by motifs 4b, 5a, motif 5c, motifs 7b and 7c, incomplete motifs 8a,c and motif  <dig>  the c-terminus displayed  <dig> % identity and encompassed motifs 11a,b, partial motif 11c, motif 11d, a distinct version of motif 11e, motif 11f, and a terminal motif 11 g that was reminiscent of the lamprey dacta-c sequences. compared to dact <dig>  motifs 4a, 5b, 7a, the nuclear localization signal motif 8b and motif  <dig> were missing.

dact3-type sequences
not surprisingly, given the differences in sequence length, dact <dig> proteins had only  <dig> % overall sequence identity. however, these proteins shared a number of features that distinguished them from the other dact-types. dact3-type proteins harbored motif  <dig>  partial motifs 2c-e and 3b, motif 3c, 4a, 5a-c, 7b, incomplete motif 8c, motif  <dig>  motif  <dig>  partial motif 11a, and well recognizable motifs 11b,c,e,f,g. motifs 2a, 4b, 8a and 11d were present in some but not all dact <dig> proteins; motifs 2b, 2f, 3b, 7a, 7c were always absent. interestingly, motifs  <dig>  4a, 5b, 7b, 11e and the pdz binding domain containing motif 11 g resembled the corresponding dact <dig> motifs more than those of dact2; overall dact <dig> motif  <dig> had  <dig> % identity with that of dact <dig> and  <dig> % identity with motif  <dig> of dact <dig>  most remarkable however was a strong reduction of the leucine zipper. owing to sequence variability at the 3’ terminus of exon  <dig> and start of exon  <dig>  this region did not regularly provide a suitable leucine to contribute to the leucine zipper. exon  <dig> encoded for several leucines, but in latimeria, the gar and the teleost dact3a proteins, a loss of 3aa interrupted the regular array of leucines, in most animals leading to a 3x plus 2x leucine zipper arrangement . since these animals represent both the sarcopterygian and the actinopterygian lineage, we concluded that the interruption of the leucine zipper had occurred before the sarcopterygian-actinopterygian split. in tetrapods, further 4aa were lost, such that 2– <dig> correctly placed leucines restored a 3x-5x leucine zipper. on the other hand, in teleost dact3b sequences, the leucine zipper was further reduced with tetraodon dact3b lacking it altogether.

dact4-type sequences
the overall conservation of the dact <dig> protein sequences was low, but several recognsizable motifs showed much higher sequence similarity. dact <dig> proteins harboured sequence motifs  <dig>  incomplete motif 2a, motifs 2d,e,f, partial motif 3a, motifs 3b, 3c, 4b, 5a, 5c, a dact4-specific motif  <dig>  a dact4-specific motif  <dig> and partial motifs 11a-c. in teleosts, motifs 5c and  <dig> were separated by a repetitive stretch consisting of repetitive asparagines and leucines; motifs  <dig> and  <dig> were separated by a stretch enriched in serines, histidines and prolines. the proteins concluded with a serine-rich domain that was ill-conserved between sarcopterygians and actinopterygians but may represent a degenerate version of motif 11e, followed by a number of alkaline and neutral aa resembling dact1- <dig> motif 11 g. thus, while these proteins evolved some new motifs, a number of motifs present in other dacts were lost. importantly, these newly identified dact proteins lacked the pdz binding domain, suggesting that they may not be able to interact with dvl. similarly, exons 1– <dig> did not encode a leucine zipper, indicating that these proteins may be unable to homo- or heterodimerize.

the cyclostome dact proteins
the cyclostome dact proteins share many of the conserved motifs identified in the gnathostome dacts. motifs 1-5c, 7b-c, 8b,  <dig>  11a-d, 11f and 11 g were well recognizable in at least one of the cyclostome proteins, and often in all of them. a leucine zipper was recognizable in all available sequence. the dacta protein had a small 2x leucine zipper encoded by exon  <dig>  while dactb showed a bipartite, 2x plus 3x, leucine zipper. no information was available for exon  <dig> of dactc, but exon  <dig> encodes a 2x leucine zipper. the orphan exon  <dig> sequence had a 3x leucine zipper. interestingly, in the dacta gene of both petromyzon and lethenteron, the 11d motif was split by an additional intron, so that the dacta gene is comprised of five exons. some of the motifs shared aa characteristic either for the dact1/ <dig> proteins or for the dact2/ <dig> proteins , but none of the cyclostome dact protein matched with either of these gnathostome metagroups.

the branchiostoma dact protein
the branchiostoma dact protein was the most divergent of the proteins we analyzed. sequences included a recognizable motif <dig> and a partial motif 2a, and contributed one leucine to a leucine zipper. exon <dig> accounted for 58aa that aligned well with exon2-derived sequences of gnathostome dact1- <dig>  contributing to motifs 2b,c, and to further leucines for an in total 5x leucine zipper. different to vertebrates, however, the branchiostoma exon2- <dig> boundary encoded an extended serine-rich stretch. exon <dig> encoded in total 872aa that encompassed sequences which in vertebrates are encoded by the 3’ end of exon <dig>  and by exons  <dig> and  <dig>  including motifs 2d,e, an incomplete motif 2f, motifs 3c, 4b, partial 5a, motifs 5b, c, the nuclear localization signal associated with motif 8b, motif 11e that was enriched in acidic aa and serines, and partial motifs 11f,g. notably, motifs 5b,c were separated by an extended stretch of  <dig> aa, and the pdz binding domain was missing. of the motifs present in branchiostoma dact, motifs  <dig> and 5b were more similar to motifs in dact1/ <dig> than to dact2/ <dig>  while motifs 2f and 3c more strongly resembled motifs present in dact2/ <dig>  taken together, we traced the origin of dacts back to chordates, where many motifs and functional domains were established already.

comparative expression analysis
our analysis showed that initially, jawed vertebrates were equipped with four dact genes, of which mammals lost dact <dig>  puffer fish lost dact <dig>  amphibians lost dact <dig> and dact <dig> and birds lost dact <dig> and dact <dig>  on the other hand, after the teleost-specific 3r, these animals kept two dact <dig> genes and hence, gained a dact gene. zebrafish and gar, by retaining the retrotranscribed dact4r gene, gained a further dact gene. all these genes may still show aspects of their original expression patterns and cooperate in a given tissue. alternatively, their expression domains may have been redistributed, with each gene acquiring unique sites of action. to investigate this, we comparatively analyzed dact gene expression in animals with the most divergent complements of dact genes: mouse , chicken , xenopus  versus zebrafish . we focused primarily on pharyngula-early somite stage embryos since at this stage, vertebrate embryos are the most similar . at this stage , mouse dact <dig> was expressed widely, with highest expression levels in the presomitic mesoderm and young somites, the proepicardium, the craniofacial mesenchyme and pharyngeal arches and the trigeminal ganglion. dact <dig> was also expressed widely, with strong signals in somites, the pharyngeal arches and the forelimb bud. dact <dig> showed prominent expression in young somites and the developing intestine ; in more strongly stained specimen, all somites as well as the trigeminal, facial and glossopharyngeal ganglia were labeled . chicken dact <dig> was expressed in the presomitic mesoderm and young somites, the craniofacial mesenchyme, the splanchnopleural lateral mesoderm, several cranial ganglia and the epibranchial placodes ; expression in the mature somites, in the limb mesenchyme and the dorsal root ganglia emerged slightly later at e <dig> . later at e <dig>  the gene was also expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the dorsal root ganglia, the limb buds, the lung bud and the eye  <cit> . xenopus dact <dig> expression was initially found in the dorsal blastopore lip, the neural plate, the emerging neural crest cells and the emerging paraxial mesoderm . at stage  <dig>  the gene was expressed in the presomitic mesoderm and young somites, the lateral mesoderm and in several cranial ganglia and the posterior lateral line placode ; in more strongly stained specimen, staining was seen in all somites as reported by  <cit> . xenopus dact <dig> showed a rather widespread expression, at gastrulation and neurulation stages labeling the primitive ectoderm, with higher expression levels in the neural plate and newly formed paraxial mesoderm . at stage  <dig>  the gene still was expressed widely, with prominent expression in the somites . in the zebrafish at 36hpf, dact <dig> was expressed widely, including the craniofacial mesenchyme, the somites, the neural tube, the otic vesicle, the pectoral fin bud and the surface ectoderm . a somewhat more restricted expression pattern was found for dact <dig> , which showed strong expression in the pharyngeal arches and the somites. dact3a showed a widespread expression including the hindbrain, pharyngeal arches and somites, while dact3b expression labeled the fore-, mid- and hindbrain, the pharyngeal arches and notochord . dact <dig> and dact4r displayed similar expression patterns, encompassing the brain, the otic vesicle and the pectoral fin bud . taken together, while individual dact genes were expressed in unique, at times species-specific locations, at least one member of the dact1/ <dig> gene group as well as of the dact2/ <dig> gene group was expressed in the paraxial mesoderm, the fin/limb buds and the mesenchyme of the pharyngeal arches in all vertebrates, suggesting that these are sites of original dact function. the exception is xenopus, where no dact2/ <dig> representative is present. here, dact <dig> has taken over dact <dig> expression domains such as the emigrating cranial neural crest cells. notably, in all species, expression domains overlapped, suggesting that dact genes may regulate tgfβ and wnt signaling in a combinatorial fashion.

discussion
dact multi-adapter proteins are important regulators at the intersection of wnt and tgfβ signaling  <cit> . the aim of this study was to shed light on the evolution of dact genes and their functional domains and motifs. here, we identified previously unknown dact genes and show that they arose late in the deuterostome lineage. in gnathostomes, four dact genes were generated after 2r, and in many extant species, these four genes are still present. the distribution of functional domains and protein motifs suggests that the ancestral dact function lied with wnt signaling; a role in tgfβ signaling may have emerged later. motif reduction in particular in the newly identified dact <dig> suggests that this protein may counteract the function of the other dacts. significantly, many dact genes are co-expressed during development. hence, the complement of dact proteins present in a given tissue will determine the outcome of wnt and tgfβ signaling events.

gnathostomes were originally equipped with four dact paralogs
previous studies identified dact <dig> , <dig> genes in mouse and humans, a dact <dig> and  <dig> gene in chicken, one dact <dig> gene in frogs , and a dact <dig> and  <dig> gene in zebrafish  <cit> . performing extensive database searches, we identified numerous gnathostome dact genes: four distinct dacts were identified in chondrichthyans; for actinopterygian bony vertebrates, we found five dacts in holosts and four to six in teleosts, and for sarcopterygians, we found four dacts in latimeria as well as in anapsid and diapsid reptiles, two in birds, two in amphibians and three in mammals. the phylogenetic analysis of dact proteins, protein motif comparison and genomic synteny analysis revealed that all these dacts belong to four paralog groups that arose after 2r rather than by individual gene duplication events. subsequently, specifically in the tetrapod lineage individual dact genes were lost, with mammals shedding dact <dig>  birds loosing dact <dig> and dact <dig>  and amphibians loosing dact <dig> and dact <dig>  the presence of dact <dig> in the two reptile lineages and the conservation of the dact <dig> gene locus in mammals and frogs suggest that in tetrapods, this newly discovered gene persisted well after the split of the amphibian and the various amniote lineages, and was independently shed in frogs, birds and mammals.

during the vertebrate 2r, dact1/ <dig> arose from one and 2/ <dig> from the other precursor
the analysis of dact proteins sequences revealed a number of motifs that distinguish individual dacts. however, we also found motif or motif variations that suggest a particularly close relationship of dact1/ <dig> and dact2/ <dig>  in phylogenetic tree analyses, dact <dig> and dact <dig> proteins formed a metagroup, and dact2/ <dig> formed another metagroup. phylogenetic trees constructed for genes that have paralogs at each of the four dact loci showed the same topology as the dact trees . metagroups linking dact1/2; dact1/4; dact3/ <dig> or dact3/ <dig> and associated genes were never observed. moreover, the pair-wise grouping of dact1/ <dig> and dact2/ <dig> sequences as well as the sequences from dact1/3- or dact2/4-associated genes was supported by high bootstrap values. this suggests that dact1/ <dig> arose from one ancestor and dact2/ <dig> from the other ancestor that had been generated during 1r .

tracing the teleost dacts
in teleost fish, the genome was duplicated a third time . however, we were only able to identify single dact <dig> and  <dig> genes, located in a conserved, dact1- and dact2-specific genomic environment, respectively. this suggests that immediately after the 3r and before the radiation of teleosts, one of the dact1and dact <dig> genes was shed. in pufferfish, while the dact <dig> locus environment was clearly recognizable, the dact <dig> gene itself was absent, suggesting a more recent gene loss. in contrast to dact <dig> and dact <dig>  consistently two genes and gene loci were found for teleost dact <dig> . in phylogenetic trees, the dact3a and 3b protein sequences formed well supported subgroups. moreover, dact3a and dact3b loci were related but clearly distinguishable. this suggests that teleosts kept both dact <dig> genes and gene loci that were generated during 3r. interestingly, two dact <dig> genes were found in the gar and the zebrafish. the first gene closely resembled the dact <dig> of other vertebrates and consisted of the typical  <dig> exons. the second gene was intronless. it resided in a similar genomic environment in the gar and the zebrafish, but this environment was unrelated to that of the first dact <dig> gene. significantly, the gar is a holost fish that has not undertaken the teleost-specific 3r  <cit> . together, this suggests that the second dact <dig> is a retrotranscribed gene  that appeared in actinopterygians before the holost-teleost split, and, together with the genuine 3r-derived dact4b, was eliminated in all teleosts analyzed here except cyprinids.

dact genes evolved late in the deuterostome lineage
dact proteins are important regulators of wnt and tgfβ signal transduction. yet these signaling pathways evolved prior to the split of deuterostome and protostome lineages  <cit> . this seems at odds with the current view that dact genes are specific for bony vertebrates  <cit> . our study for the first time identified dact sequences in cyclostome vertebrates and in non-vertebrate chordates. however, despite intensive searches, no dact sequences were found outside chordates, suggesting that dact genes appeared late in the deuterostome lineage. in the cyclostomes petromyzon marinus and lethenteron japonicum, our searches identified several genomic fragments encoding aa sequences with homology to gnathostome dacts. as some of these fragments were unlinked, it was not possible to determine the exact number of dact genes present in cyclostomes. however, at least four distinct dacts could be clearly distinguished. currently, it is controversial whether cyclostomes and gnathostomes shared the first round of genome duplication, whether an independent genome duplication occurred in the cyclostome lineage, or whether individual genes were duplicated  <cit> . while most of the phylogenetic trees rather support independent expansions of the dact family in cyclostomes and gnathostomes, the star-like topology shown by quartet puzzling indicates the uncertainty of their relationship. for non-vertebrate chordates, we were able to identify a dact gene in the florida lancelet, but not in any of the tunicates searched. this is remarkable, given that tunicates are thought to be more closely related to vertebrates than cephalochordates  <cit> . however, tunicates have reduced their body plan during evolution, and it is possible that they secondarily lost their dact gene. we can speculate that the loss of signaling cascades regulators may have facilitated the reduction of tunicate body structures.

the original chordate dact may have served in wnt signaling
comparing the presence and distribution of functional domains and proteins motifs we found that a number of these, but not all, were shared by dacts from gnathostomes, cyclostomes and the lancelet, including motifs  <dig>  2a-f, 3c, 4b, 5a-c, 8b, 11e-f, and the basic aa of the c-terminal motif 11 g. thus, these motifs may represent the original repertoire of the ancestral dact. motifs 1– <dig> occupy the n-terminal half of dact proteins and encompass the leucine zipper essential for homo- and heterodimerization, a functionally characterized and a further predicted nuclear export signal, a domain that assists binding to dvl and a domain that in gnathostome dact <dig> has been implicated in tcf <dig> binding  <cit> , and this study). the motifs located in the c-terminal half provide a functionally characterized nuclear localization signal  and contribute to the vangl binding domain . all proteins are enriched with serines, particularly in the area containing motifs 2f, 11e. this suggests that already the ancestral dact was a multiadaptor protein, capable of interacting with molecules in the β catenin dependent and pcp wnt signaling pathway, possibly able to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and subject to extensive regulation by phosphorylation.

in gnathostomes dacts  <dig> , <dig>  motif 11 g contains the k-l/v-mttv sequence, a pdz binding domain required for the interaction of dact with dvl  <cit> . this motif was also found in cyclostome dacta, b and d, suggesting that it was a feature of the dact protein in the last common ancestor of vertebrates. in contrast, the lancelet motif 11 g does not contain a recognizable pdz binding motif. thus, either branchiostoma dact has secondarily lost this sequence, or alternatively, this sequence appeared in the vertebrate lineage. consequently, it cannot be decided when the main dvl-interacting ability of dacts emerged during evolution. however, this function was firmly established in the vertebrate lineage.

in addition to the pdz binding domain, a number of further motifs  are found in gnathostome and cyclostome dacts, suggesting that they arose in the vertebrate lineage. motif 4a resides in the tcf <dig> binding domain, and motif 11d maps to the region implicated in vangl binding  <cit> . thus, it is possible that these vertebrate-specific motifs improved the ability to control wnt signaling events. gnathostome proteins exhibit some additional motifs , and the region encompassing motifs 2a-f and 11a-g is strongly conserved. this suggests that the stabilized protein domains carry out essential molecular roles. unfortunately, the gnathostome-specific sequence motifs have not been functionally characterized.

the ability to inhibit alk <dig> may have evolved with dact2/ <dig> genes
functional studies on mammalian and zebrafish dact <dig> showed that this molecule can regulate both wnt and tgfβ signaling  <cit> . the corresponding test has not been carried out for dact <dig> ; however, in binding assays using mouse dact proteins, only dact <dig> showed significant alk <dig> affinity  <cit> . interestingly, the region that was implicated in dact2-alk <dig> interaction is very similar in all dact <dig> and  <dig> proteins. moreover, this region contains motif 3a which is absent in dact1/ <dig> proteins. furthermore, gnathostome dact2/ <dig> have secondarily lost the s-p rich motif 4a in the tcf <dig> binding domain and motif 5b in the internal dvl binding domain. molecular studies are required to test whether these differences account for the ability of dact proteins to interact with alk <dig>  however, it is quite possible that the ability to regulate tgfβ signaling evolved with or was stabilized in the ancestor of dact2/ <dig>  at the expense of some functions in the wnt signaling system.

could the gnathostome dact <dig> be an “anti-dact”?
it has been recognized that after the two  rounds of gnathostome genome duplications, re-diploidization occurred for many genes, but duplicated genes involved in signaling were preferentially retained. this has been interpreted as an evolutionary platform to increase complexity  <cit> . however, immediately after these duplication events, biological systems are potentially deregulated and instable. after the 2r, the ancestral gnathostome had four dact genes, all possibly interfering with wnt signaling. moreover, with the duplication of dact2/ <dig>  possibly also the capacity to inhibit tgfβ signaling was enhanced. furthermore, in the actinopterygian lineage, the dact4r gene appeared, potentially further destabilizing the system. how did vertebrates cope with this?

in a number of gnathostome lineages, dact genes were shed: mammals lost dact <dig>  birds lost dact <dig> and  <dig>  frogs lost dact <dig> and  <dig> , teleosts lost the duplicated dact <dig> , dact <dig>  dact <dig>  and most also lost dact4r. in animals that kept a complement of dact <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  the dact <dig> leucine zipper was reduced or incapacitated, thus inhibiting the ability to dimerize. in teleost dact <dig> proteins, the motif 4b in the tcf <dig> binding domain was reduced  or removed , possibly reducing tcf3-binding capacity. furthermore, in most  dact3b genes the 3rd exon was lost. thus, specifically in teleosts, dact <dig> genes may have evolved into a less potent version of dact <dig> 

amongst gnathostome dacts, however, dact <dig> is the most derived. the protein lost , modified  and gained  a number of motifs. significantly, the lost motifs encompass the leucine zipper; thus, the proteins are unable to dimerize. the modified motifs encompass the internal and the c-terminal  dvl binding domain, and hence, dact <dig> proteins may be unable to regulate this key molecule essential for all wnt pathways. since some motifs have been maintained and new motifs have been stabilized, we can assume, however, that the protein is able to carry out some protein-protein interactions. this may lead to a sequestering of dact-interacting proteins, and hence the antagonization of dact <dig> , <dig> function.

the combinatorial expression of dact genes may determine the outcome of wnt and tgfβ signaling events in gnathostomes
in addition to gene loss or sub- and neo-functionalization, duplicated genes may diversify at the level of their cis-regulatory sequences, leading to expression divergence  <cit> . however, our expression analysis of mouse , chicken , xenopus  and zebrafish dacts  suggests that at the pharyngula- early somite stage of development , dact genes are co-expressed in many tissues. notably, most dact <dig> and  <dig> genes, and where present, dact3/dact3a genes were expressed in the paraxial mesoderm, the fin/limb buds and the craniofacial mesenchyme and pharyngeal arches , suggesting that they are the sites of original dact function before the split of the dact1/ <dig> and dact2/ <dig> groups. this coexpression furthermore suggests that in a given tissue, the outcome of wnt and tgfβ signaling events depends on the combinatorial activity of these dacts.

in the zebrafish, dact3b and dact <dig> genes are mainly expressed in the brain, nevertheless still labeling the pharyngeal arches  and the pectoral fin buds . the latter is remarkable since the expression of a retrotranscribed gene depends on the regulatory elements present at the integration site. it could be speculated that this potential anti-dact has been kept since, together with the original dact <dig>  it may counterbalance the function of the numerous dact1- <dig> gene products. however, the net outcome of dact function in mouse and chicken  and in the fish  may be similar.

CONCLUSIONS
this study traced the evolution of dact genes and with it, the evolution of a molecular system that allows the simultaneous control of wnt and tgfβ signaling. our study suggests that dacts are chordate specific, with gnathostome dact1/ <dig> having arisen from one, dact2/ <dig> from the second precursor generated after 2r. the protein motifs present in the lancelet and gnathostome dacts suggest that while the control of wnt signaling may have been the ancestral role of these proteins, the ability to inhibit tgfβ signaling may have evolved with the gnathostome dact2/ <dig> precursor. moreover, our study raises the possibility that in those vertebrates that kept dact <dig>  this protein may inhibit the function of the other dacts. our study provides the basis for structural and molecular biologists to systematically test the function of the shared and divergent dact protein motifs, and for cell and developmental biologists to explore the combinatorial aspects of dact function.
