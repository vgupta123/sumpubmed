BACKGROUND
linkage mapping is a key tool for identifying the genetic basis of quantitative traits in plants. most agronomic traits in crops are controlled by complex quantitative trait loci  and their genetic basis is frequently dissected using qtl mapping. in rapeseed , the world’s second most important oilseed crop, a vast number of studies have reported qtl for various agronomic, developmental, seed quality and resistance traits since the first genetic mapping of qtl in this species by  <cit> . bi-parental genetic mapping populations can be limited by low polymorphism or small population size, however. in addition, only two alleles per locus and few recombination events are considered to estimate the genetic distance between marker loci and to identify the causative genomic regions underlying qtl, thereby limiting the mapping resolution. although the power of qtl detection in bi-parental mapping populations is generally high, the value of the detected qtl for breeding is often underscored by unpredictable effects in different genetic backgrounds.

association genetics approaches, utilising genetically unrelated collections or populations of varieties and breeding lines, are a useful alternative for qtl localisation  <cit> . in contrast to conventional qtl mapping, association mapping is based on linkage disequilibrium . utilisation of the higher number of historical recombinations in less related populations can greatly improve the mapping resolution compared to a segregating bi-parental population  <cit> . in recent years association mapping has been broadly adopted for quantitative genetic analyses in crop species . a major prerequisite for association mapping is the availability of densely-spaced, molecular markers spanning the entire genome. the discovery and implementation of genome-wide screening for single-nucleotide polymorphism  markers, even in complex polyploid crop species like b. napus, has advanced extremely rapidly in recent years since the introduction of ultrafast dna sequencing technologies  <cit> . high-density snp arrays like the brassica 60 k snp illumina consortium array  have opened the way for high-resolution qtl analyses based on linkage disequilibrium  in both major and minor crops.

a well-known problem with genome-wide association studies  is the presence of undetected population structure, which can lead to both false-positive results and a failure to detect genuine associations  <cit> . because it also strongly influences ld patterns  <cit> , an accurate estimate and understanding of population structure is critically important for association mapping. on the other hand, ld analyses also provide important insight into the history of both natural and artificial selection  and can give valuable guidance to breeders seeking to diversify crop gene pools. recent studies of different b. napus ecotypes using collections of genome-wide simple-sequence repeat  markers gave first insight into genetic diversity and population structure in large collections of b. napus
 <cit> . however studies with limited numbers of pcr-based markers are often unable to capture the full extent of ld in diverse populations, and conclusions are limited when data on ld cannot be accurately related to genomic positions of the markers.

the concept of ld describes the non-random association of alleles at two or more loci caused by genetic linkage. many evolutionary and genetic factors can influence ld. in particular it can reflect the history of natural and artificial selection, mutation, segmental recombination rates, gene conversion and other forces that cause selective sweeps in a genome. estimates of the extent of ld decay in crop genomes vary depending on the specific species, gene pool or population under investigation. for example, in different sorghum diversity collections a decay of ld was reported to occur within 15– <dig> kb  <cit> , 50– <dig> kb  <cit>  and 400 kb  <cit> . less variation was observed in different populations of maize, with estimates between  <dig> - <dig>  kb  and 1–10 kb  <cit> , and rice, with estimates of 20–50 cm  <cit>  and 75– <dig> kb  <cit> . in arabidopsis ld has been estimated from  <dig> kb  <cit>  to over 250 kb  <cit> . in different b. napus populations average ld estimates based on genetic distance measurements were also estimated to vary greatly, from 1–2 cm  <cit>  to more than 20 cm  <cit> .

some studies have demonstrated that snps in strong ld are organised into discrete haplotype blocks that are possibly separated by hotspots of recombination. genetic variation across the genome is defined by these haplotype blocks, while species-specific block structure is defined by the differential contribution of population history effects in combination with mutation and recombination events. conservation of haplotype structure may therefore be used for the identification and characterization of functionally important genomic regions during evolution and/or selection. for example, high-resolution analysis of human y-chromosome haplotypes suggested that a large component of a present-day asian gene pool originates from eastern africa and that asia was the source of a back-migration to sub-saharan africa  <cit> . haplotype map analysis in maize found hundreds of selective sweeps and highly differentiated regions that probably contain loci that are keys to geographic adaptation  <cit> . high-throughput snp genotyping technologies today enable the use of large numbers of snps to construct high resolution ld and haplotype block maps. this is crucial for accurate understanding of associations between markers, genes and phenotypic traits, and at the same time can give more in-depth understanding with regard to species evolution.

low seed glucosinolate and erucic acid concentrations are two of the most important traits for rapeseed breeding. both traits have undergone intense purifying selection in elite varieties during the short history of this crop. detailed analyses of ld and haplotype blocks surrounding major qtl for these two traits  <cit>  will provide valuable new information about selective sweeps and potential linkage drag in the corresponding chromosome areas. at the same time these qtl provide interesting examples to study the dynamics of recent selection signatures at homoeologous trait loci in an important allopolyploid crop species.

brassica napus is a very recent allopolyploid , derived from only a small number of interspecific hybridisation events between b. rapa  and b. oleracea  within just the past few thousand years  <cit> . besides artificially synthesised b. napus, only cultivated forms are known, and genetic diversity analyses have revealed only a few eco-geographically and genetically distinct gene pools among cultivated b. napus
 <cit> . these suggest that the species may have derived by independent interspecific hybridisation events in europe and asia. today’s asian semi-winter type rapeseed represents a major intermediate gene pool between european winter-type oilseed rape and spring-sown canola, grown primarily in north america. china’s most important oilseed crop, grown on over  <dig> million ha, is therefore also a potentially rich source of genetic variation to diversify these narrow gene pools. chinese rapeseed breeding has extensively used diploid brassica species, particularly b. rapa, to enrich the genetic potential of the local gene pool for resistance traits and to improve heterosis. different b. napus gene pools have undergone strict selection for flowering-related traits, including vernalisation requirement, winter survival and photoperiod-dependant flowering, and for essential seed quality traits . together with its recent alloploidisation this makes b. napus an interesting model for investigating genome-wide and subgenome-specific patterns of genomic and allelic diversification, in the face of broad selective sweeps, during crop domestication.

with these aspects in mind the objectives of this study were:  to evaluate genome-specific patterns of population structure and genetic diversity in chinese semi-winter rapeseed using densely spaced genome-wide snp markers,  to study the extent of ld decay and variation in the distribution of haplotype block size within the a- and c-subgenomes, and  to study the effects of intense selection for major seed quality qtl on homoeologous genome regions.

RESULTS
genome-wide snp polymorphism
from the total of  <dig>  snps called by the cluster file to be polymorphic in the diversity panel, a stringent blast alignment  of their flanking sequences to the draft b. napus reference genome identified  <dig>  snps with potentially two or more loci in the b. napus genome, along with  <dig>  snps showing no identical blast hit. a total of  <dig>  single-locus snps, each mapping to a single physical genome position, were henceforth implemented for the downstream analyses. for the ld and population structure analysis,  <dig>  snps with maf < <dig>  were also eliminated, leaving  <dig>  high-quality, polymorphic, single-locus snps with maf ≥ <dig> . the genotype data for these  <dig>  snps in the diversity panel are provided in additional file  <dig> along with their flanking sequence information and expected chromosome positions in the b. napus darmor-bzh reference genome  <cit> .

population structure and diversity analysis in the a- and c-subgenomes
the results of the population structure analysis measured using the model-based software structure are shown in figure 1a. the lnp value for each given k increased together with k, the most significant change being observed when k increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  over all iterations of the ∆k calculation a much higher likelihood was shown for k =  <dig> than for k = 4- <dig>  this suggests the presence of  <dig> main subpopulations, hereinafter designated q <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> . subpopulation q <dig> includes  <dig> chinese semi-winter,  <dig> spring and  <dig> winter rapeseed accessions, while subpopulation q <dig> contains  <dig> chinese semi-winter rapeseed lines. q <dig> contains  <dig> semi-winter lines,  <dig> spring-type and  <dig> winter-type rapeseed. the remaining  <dig> accessions, including  <dig> spring-type and  <dig> winter rapeseed accession, were classified into a mixed subpopulation as they had membership probabilities lower than  <dig>  in any given subpopulation .

the pca based on nei’s genetic distance analysis reflected the structure results, with the mixed subpopulation clustering in the middle of the three defined subpopulations . the first principal component  accounted for  <dig> % of the genetic variation and roughly grouped the semi-winter rapeseed into the three main groups q <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig>  the second principal component  accounted for  <dig> % of the genetic variation and particularly reflected the differentiation between q <dig> and q <dig> figure  <dig>

comparative analysis of genetic diversity within the three subpopulations revealed higher average pic and gene diversity in subpopulations q <dig> and q <dig> than in q <dig> . the average genetic distance among lines within q <dig>  was very close to that among the winter rapeseed materials , whereas subpopulation q <dig> showed the same average genetic distance as the five spring rapeseed accessions . subpopulation q <dig> had the lowest average genetic distance of  <dig>  . collectively these results suggest introgressions of winter-type oilseed rape genetic background into subpopulation q <dig> and spring-type genetic background into q <dig>  whereas subpopulation q <dig> appears to represent a relatively pure genetic background of semi-winter b. napus.

pca and upgma tree analysis, using only the  <dig> chinese semi-winter genotypes to analyse population structure, resulted in subdivision into the same three subpopulations by pca analysis, whereby the principal component accounting for genetic diversity was smaller than with inclusion of the outliers in the full set of  <dig> lines . the results of the upgma tree analysis corresponded with around 91% similarity to the pca .table  <dig>

in  <dig> of these accessions, the first and second principle component analysis accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig> % genetic diversity in the a-subgenome, compared to only  <dig>  and  <dig> % in the c-subgenome. among these materials the gene diversity  and pic  were also higher in the a-subgenome than the c-subgenome  . in another group of  <dig> accessions, on the other hand, the first and second principle components explained only  <dig>  and  <dig> % when a-subgenome snps were used, but  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, with c-subgenome snps. accordingly, in these  <dig> accessions the gene diversity  and pic  were also lower in the a-subgenome than the c-subgenome  . collectively these results suggest that the a-subgenome contributes more genetic diversity to chinese semi-winter rapeseed than the c-subgenome, but also that a small group of materials appears to have benefited from targeted introgressions of c-subgenome diversity.

relative kinship
analysis of kinship using  <dig> unique snps each from the a- and c-subgenomes, all with maf ≥  <dig> , supported the finding that the a-subgenome carries more overall genetic diversity than the c-subgenome . at the same time the kinship analysis showed only weak or no relationship among the materials. this might be attributed to the introgression of different rapeseed ecotypes and closely related species.figure  <dig>

patterns of ld across the semi-winter rapeseed genome
to assess patterns of ld extent in more detail, we measured the physical distance at which the pair-wise genotypic association in the filtered snp dataset decays below a threshold of r2 =  <dig> . this revealed huge differences in ld decay between different chromosomes, with ld extending from  <dig> - <dig>  mb  up to  <dig> - <dig>  mb  . figure  <dig> and table  <dig> compare the distribution of r <dig> with respect to the physical distance over the  <dig> chromosomes, as well as overall across each subgenome. considerably faster mean ld decay was observed on a-subgenome chromosomes  than c-subgenome chromosomes .table  <dig>

subgenome-specific haplotype block structure
the same markers used for ld estimation were employed to estimate haplotype blocks in the  <dig> semi-winter rapeseed accessions. in the a-subgenome, the mean maf per chromosome varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , with a mean of  <dig>  over all a-subgenome chromosomes. the mean r <dig> per a-subgenome chromosome varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>   with a mean of  <dig>  over the whole a-subgenome . on c-subgenome chromosomes mean maf varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , with an average of  <dig>  over the whole c-subgenome. the mean r <dig> on c-subgenome chromosomes was considerably higher, ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   with an average of  <dig>  over the whole c-subgenome . the higher maf in the a-subgenome and stronger ld in the c-subgenome further indicate a higher genetic diversity of the a-subgenome than the c-subgenome.table  <dig>

a summary of the distribution, size and number of haplotype blocks per chromosome is presented in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  conserved haplotype blocks were detected in the  <dig> chinese semi-winter rapeseed accessions, spanning  <dig>  mb . in the a-subgenome chromosomes, mean haplotype block number ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  while the mean haplotype size ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  kb  with an average of  <dig>  kb. the mean haplotype block number in c-subgenome chromosomes varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> kb  with an average of  <dig> kb, while mean haplotype size was considerably larger, ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  kb  with an average of  <dig>  kb . in the a-subgenome  <dig> % and  <dig> % of haplotype blocks ranged in size from 0– <dig> kb and 10– <dig> kb, respectively, whereas only  <dig> % of c-subgenome haplotype blocks were in the 0– <dig> kb size range and only  <dig> % in the 10– <dig> kb size range . in contrast, much fewer regions with long-range haplotype conservation were observed in the a-subgenome, where haplotype blocks ranging in size from 50– <dig> kb, 100– <dig> kb and 200– <dig> kb were present at frequencies of only  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. in the c-subgenome, on the one hand, the respective haplotype block sizes were observed at much higher frequencies of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively , demonstrating that the higher mean haplotype block size in the c-subgenome is caused by retention of long-range ld.figure  <dig>

particularly high conservation of ld was observed on chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  which showed very high average r <dig> values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and correspondingly large mean haplotype block sizes of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively .

analysis of homoeologous qtl regions
comparative sequence analysis revealed conserved haplotype blocks and ld corresponding to homoeologous qtl for seed glucosinolate content on homoeologous chromosomes a02/c <dig> and a09/c <dig>  respectively, and for erucic acid content on chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig>  the genomic positions of known qtl for seed glucosinolate content on chromosome a02/c <dig>  were localised by a bioedit local blast search  <cit>  using  <dig> and  <dig> snps, respectively, within the qtl confidence intervals. these snps mapped to overlapping homoeologous regions from  <dig> , <dig> –  <dig> ,416 bp on chromosome a <dig> and from  <dig> ,157 bp –  <dig> ,708 bp on chromosome c <dig>  respectively . similarly,  <dig> snps spanning another major qtl for seed glucosinolate content on chromosome a <dig>  <cit>  were localised to overlapping homoeologous regions from  <dig>  –  <dig> ,394 bp and  <dig>  –  <dig> ,219 bp on chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig>  respectively . insufficient snps were present in the qtl on chromosome c <dig> from  <cit> , hence the physical region on c <dig> was predicted by a blast search of snps from the homoeologous qtl region on a <dig> 

homoeologous qtl for erucic acid content on chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig>  <cit>  were physically localised using  <dig> and  <dig> snps, respectively, spanning these two loci. the corresponding qtl covered the regions from  <dig> , <dig> –  <dig> ,483 bp and  <dig> , <dig> –  <dig> ,658 bp on chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig>  respectively . as expected, these regions include the two b. napus homologues of the gene fatty acid elongase  <dig>  that carry the agronomically essential low erucic acid mutations  <cit> . results from matching of the physical positions were compared to blast alignments of sequences against each other with similar results .figure  <dig>

comparative analysis of haplotype blocks within homoeologous qtl for key traits
estimates of d' based on marker pairs lying within homoeologous qtl for seed glucosinolate  and erucic acid content  revealed large differences in recombination structure and extent of ld between the respective homoeologous chromosome regions . two qtl for gls described by delourme et al.  <cit>  were physically mapped to  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb regions of chromosomes a <dig> and a <dig>  whereas the corresponding homoeologous regions on chromosome c <dig> and c <dig> covered  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, respectively. on a <dig> and a <dig> the mean r <dig>  and mean haplotype block sizes  are both considerably smaller than in the homoeologous regions on c <dig> and c <dig>  . a similar observation was made for the eurcic acid content qtl region described by delourme et al.
 <cit> , which mapped to a physical region covering  <dig>  mb of chromosome a <dig> and a homoeologous region of  <dig>  mb on chromosome c <dig>  on a <dig> the erucic acid qtl region shows considerably lower ld  and mean haplotype block size  than the homoeologous qtl region on c <dig>  .figure  <dig>

we further analyzed these homoeologous qtl regions for genes related to seed gls and erucic acid content, respectively. three gsl biosynthetic process genes and one gsl catabolic process gene were located in a  <dig>  mb region with disrupted ld that spanned the qtl for gsl on a <dig> . in contrast the homoeologous qtl region on chromosome c <dig> contained seven gsl-related genes  that spanned a  <dig>  mb region with extensive ld. this region included four glucosinolate biosynthetic process genes, within three conserved haplotype blocks ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb . similar patterns of ld conservation were observed between the homoeologous qtl for gsl on chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig>  on a <dig>  four gsl biosynthetic process genes  were located within a  <dig>  mb region with low ld. in contrast, seven genes implicated in gsl biosynthesis  were located in a  <dig>  mb region, including four gsl biosynthesis genes, within three conserved haplotype blocks ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb .

on chromosome a <dig>  the major qtl for erucic acid content was found to contain five additional fatty acid biosynthetic process genes besides the causal gene bnaa.fae <dig>  these included a 3-ketoacyl-synthase 4-like gene and two chloroplast omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase orthologues, along with four fatty acid beta-oxidation genes. within a total length of  <dig>  mb we found that two fatty acid beta-oxidation genes and one fatty acid biosynthetic process gene  were located in separate haplotype blocks, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb . within the corresponding homoeologous qtl region on chromosome c <dig> we localised six fatty acid biosynthetic process genes  and three fatty acid beta-oxidation genes, covering a total of  <dig>  mb. four of the fatty acid biosynthesis genes  and one fatty acid beta-oxidation gene were located in strongly conserved haplotype blocks ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb .

the different intensities of selection at a- and c-subgenome qtl for seed erucic acid and gsl content were confirmed by reanalyzing the extent of ld conservation based on r <dig> with ldheatmap . again we found strong ld conservation and similar gene content within the c-subgenome qtl, whereas a-subgenome qtl showed less conserved ld and more fragmented haplotype structure . the results suggest considerably stronger retention of c-subgenome haplotype blocks than a-subgenome haplotypes within these important seed quality qtl.

discussion
population structure and genetic diversity
rapeseed breeding materials in australia and china have similar origins, with introductions from europe, canada and japan in the mid-20th century and subsequent interchange of germplasm since that time  <cit> . recently, hybrid breeding has received considerable attention, with development of genetically diverse gene pools through recurrent, reciprocal selection of genetic diversity from different b. napus ecotypes  <cit> . the three main population subgroups we observed in our diversity panel may reflect breeding efforts to diversify chinese semi-winter rapeseed by introgressing genetically distant winter rapeseed  and spring canola  into different hybrid breeding pools.

genetic diversity in chinese b. napus has been further improved by introgressions from asian b. rapa
 <cit> , the diploid donor of the b. napus a-subgenome. according to liu  <cit>  and shiga  <cit> , more than 50% of b. napus cultivars in china and japan are derived from b. napus × b. rapa crossings. correspondingly, we observed considerably more genetic diversity in the a-subgenome of chinese rapeseed than the c-subgenome. interestingly, however, we found  <dig> accessions with a stronger diversity in the c-subgenome than the a-subgenome. these may derive from programs to introgress additional diversity and resistance alleles from c-genome donors.

ld and haplotype block analysis
around  <dig> % of the assembled b. napus genome could be assigned to haplotype blocks, with large gaps between blocks . with an average snp density of only one snp per  <dig>  kb, it is difficult to detect very small haplotype blocks  <cit> . recent studies in maize  <cit>  and arabidopsis,  <cit>  have demonstrated the power of comprehensive genome-wide snp genotyping arrays for generation of detailed haplotype maps and high-resolution ld analysis. whole-genome resequencing data provides the ultimate dimension to uncover ld in association with signatures of natural and artificial selection, but so far has been limited to species with relative small, diploid genomes, like sorghum  <cit> . many of the problems with duplicated snp loci on the brassica 60 k snp array result from the extensive recent genome duplications which make it quite challenging to design locus-specific snp assays in many strongly homoeologous regions of the genome. these technical difficulties can cause a reduction in resolution in some genome regions. nevertheless, use of a high-density snp array to analyse and compare ld and selection in homoeologous qtl is a unique feature of this study in comparison to previous work in simple diploid species. as a recent allopolyploid b. napus thus provides interesting insight into the evolutionary processes of selection in an important crop  <cit> .

the  <dig>  unique, polymorphic snps we used in our analyses were nevertheless sufficient to perform a preliminary whole-genome analysis of haplotype block structure in b. napus. in particular we were able to demonstrate that some b. napus chromosomes carry extremely large segments of highly conserved ld, and that this phenomenon is a particular feature of c-subgenome chromosomes. this may indicate increased recombination rates of a-subgenome chromosomes after interspecific hybridisations with b. rapa. boosts of homologous recombination among diploid chromosome pairs after interspecific hybridisation were documented in brassica crosses by leflon et al.  <cit> ; this might have caused more rapid ld decay and subsequently shorter-range haplotype blocks in a-subgenome chromosomes in the present materials after hybridisations with b. rapa. although breeders have used interspecific crosses to improve agronomic traits and increase c-subgenome genetic diversity in b. napus, it is extremely difficult to obtain viable hybrid seeds from b. napus × b. oleracea crosses  <cit> , causing a constraint in the ability to diversify the c-subgenome genetic component. it is thought that b. napus arose only in post-neolithic times and from only a small number of independent hybridisation events  <cit> , and that the chinese rapeseed genepool may predominantly represent only one or a few of these events. hence it is perhaps not surprising that recombination and diversity appear to be considerably lower in the c-subgenome of chinese oilseed rape. an alternative explanation, which may also partly explain the great overall difference in ld between the a and c subgenomes, is the considerably greater expansion of transposable elements in the b. napus c-subgenome compared to the a-subgenome  <cit> , since transposon-rich regions are often observed to be recombination-poor  <cit> . on the other hand, this fails to explain the great variation in the size of ld and long-range haplotype blocks we observed among different c-subgenome chromosomes. a more simple contributing factor is likely to be strong natural and artificial selection for key adaptation and seed quality traits, where specific variants seem to have been selected during the face of ecogeographical adaptation and human selection, for example for flowering time or quality traits. strong selection at a locus is expected to reduce diversity and increase ld and haplotype block size in the surrounding region  <cit> .

in particular, stronger ld and longer-range ld blocks on chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> suggest particularly strong selection the corresponding region of these chromosomes. according to liu  <cit>  rapeseed was introduced into china from europe in the 1930-1940s, although a later origin within the past few hundred years in japan is also postulated  <cit> . guryev et al.  <cit>  showed that the evolutionary selection process drives conservation of long-range allele combinations, causing chromosome regions to retain a long-range haplotype block structure. artificial selection can also have a profound effect on ld in crop plants, with selection for key agronomic traits like flowering behavior, resistances or essential quality parameters causing genetic bottlenecks that lead to extensive conserved haplotype blocks in chromosome regions carrying the responsible gene loci or major qtl for selected traits. modern double-low quality oilseed rape has undergone selective sweeps for reduction of seed erucic acid and glucosinolate contents, along with flowering time, winter hardiness and vernalisation-related traits. such selection tends to reduce allele diversity and increase haplotype block structure around the major responsible loci, however detailed studies of ld conservation in oilseed rape breeding pools on a dna sequence level has only recently become possible since the availability of high-density genome-wide snp markers  <cit>  in combination with annotated brassica genome sequences. here we identified chromosome-scale ld patterns in b. napus genome regions carrying important qtl for both a simple, bigenically inherited trait  and for a complex quantitative trait .

the observed distance of ld decay in chinese oilseed rape was  <dig> - <dig>  mb, which is higher than maize with  <dig> -10 kb  <cit>  and arabidopsis with 50– <dig> kb  <cit> . this reflects the very recent domestication of b. napus, its exclusive use in cultivation, with no known wild forms, and the strong selection bottlenecks associated with cultivation and breeding. previous studies  have shown that the a-subgenome has been successfully improved by closely related species, leading to more rapid decay of ld in the a-subgenome than the c-subgenome. our results showed that the relatively low overall ld conservation in chinese rapeseed is caused mainly by a lack of genetic diversity in the c-subgenome. according to mei et al.  <cit> , natural b. napus has very low genetic diversity compared with its diploid progenitors, therefore intercrossing with the parental species can be an effective way to broaden genetic diversity in rapeseed. to achieve this it may be necessary to overcome sexual compatibility barriers by using embryo rescue techniques, for example. in recent years considerable progress has been made in introducing novel c-genome donors to european winter oilseed rape, in order to improve genetic diversity particularly for disease resistance  or heterosis  <cit> .

haplotype block and extent of ld of homologues qtl region
conserved haplotype blocks with strong ld spanning major homoeologous qtl for seed gls  and erucic acid  reflect the strong selection bottlenecks for these traits. on the other hand, the introgression of exotic a-subgenome diversity from b. rapa has apparently led to shorter-range haplotype blocks and lower ld in a-subgenome than c-subgenome qtl. chinese b. napus originated from europe  <cit> , being introduced to china in the 1930-1940s and replacing the traditional oilseed crop b. rapa. local adaptation to the new ecogeographical environment, and diversification of breeding pools, was achieved by introgressing local populations of the wild progenitors and closely related species, particularly b. rapa
. our results show that this process resulted in substantial decay of ld surrounding important a-subgenome qtl, whereas longer-range haplotype blocks and higher ld are retained around c-subgenome qtl regions. importantly, conserved haplotype blocks in c-subgenome qtl tend to retain multiple genes related to relevant biosynthetic processes, which can potentially cause linkage drag that slows breeding progress for the trait of interest.

various forces have potentially contributed to haplotype conservation in c-subgenome qtl in b. napus, including genetic bottlenecks from artificial or natural selection or a simple lack of recombination and sequence diversity. we found rates of sequence polymorphism to be generally lower in c-subgeneome qtl regions than their corresponding a-subgenome homoeologues, suggesting that the former may be the dominant mechanism. on the other hand a suppression of recombination, due to the increased density of transposable elements in the c-subgenome  <cit> , cannot be ruled out. detailed haplotype block analysis of important qtl can help in the precise mapping of important genomic regions and location of favorable alleles. in association with genomic sequence data it can also help to more precisely predict quantitative trait-related genes  in qtl regions using targeted association mapping with high-density markers.

the strongly conserved ld we observed across the qtl on chromosomes c <dig> and c <dig> was found to be associated with a large number of functionally related genes in close genetic linkage. the corresponding homoeologous qtl on chromosomes a <dig> and a <dig> each contained fewer genes annotated to the qtl function. this result demonstrates the important role of gene loss during or after allopolyploidisation in natural and/or artificial selection of key traits like gsl content  <cit> . natural evolution results in a positive and balancing selection within the genome, whereas artificial secletion can lead to partial separation of phenotypic traits. according to harper et al.  <cit> , deletions affecting homologues of the gsl biosynthesis gene bna.hag1/myb <dig> resulted in selective sweeps affecting the qtl for gsl on a <dig> and c <dig>  both in this case, and in the case of homologous qtl erucic acid content on chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig>  we demonstrate that selective sweeps can also incorporate additional, functionally-related genes for which alleles in strong ld may have either a positive or negative influence  on target traits . detailed analysis of ld structure and signatures of selection in important qtl can guide breeders towards a knowledge-based crop improvement by genome-based introgression of useful genetic diversity.

CONCLUSIONS
using densely-spaced genome-wide snps to analyse subgenomic genetic diversity in semi-winter b. napus, we found stronger ld and long-range haplotype conservation in c-subgenome chromosomes. comparative sequence analysis revealed conserved blocks containing homoloeogous qtl for important seed quality traits under intense artificial selection. the results indicate strong selection for large chromosome regions associated with important seed quality traits conferred by c-subgenome qtl, suggesting that an increase in genetic diversity and recombination within the c-genome is particularly important for breeding. the resolution of genome-wide association studies is also expected to vary greatly across different genome regions.
