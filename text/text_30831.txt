BACKGROUND
in tropical regions, the incidence of the bovine tick rhipicephalus  microplus deeply affects cattle production systems leading to a decrease in production and reproduction traits and even death of highly susceptible animals. ticks, as blood-feeding parasites, affect their hosts both directly and as vector of viral, bacterial and protozoal diseases. furlong et al.  <cit>  found that 1/ <dig> gyr: 1/ <dig> holstein cows showed 23% decrease on milk production when the parasite load was ca.  <dig> ticks/cow.

brazil has the largest commercial cattle herd in the world with more than  <dig> million animals and wastes approximately  <dig> million kg of meat/year  and  <dig> billion liters of milk/year  due to tick burdens  <cit> . in addition, infestation with ticks causes major losses in leather quality. majority of brazil's milk production is derived from crossbreds herds  also called girolando. the importance of gyr breed is paramount since it brings rusticity against heat and parasites to the highly productive holstein breed in tropical regions  <cit> .

most of tick control is routinely accomplished by acaricides, however long term treatment has generated resistant strains. use of acaricides, besides bringing additional costs to farmers, leaves chemical residues in meat, milk and in the environment. vaccines have been used in some countries without solving the problem completely  <cit> . according de la fuente et al.  <cit>  a combination of commercial and technical problems has contributed to lack of vaccine usage.

bos indicus breeds are known to be more resistant to ticks than bos taurus breeds  <cit> . since domestication took place in harsh environment, it could have guided the development of naturally resistant breeds. in this way, one alternative against tick burdens could be the use of resistant animals that could be correctly identified in the production systems with the aid of molecular tools.

complex traits, such as disease resistance are under control of many genes, each with a different contribution on the phenotype. a quantitative trait loci  is defined as a chromosomal segment showing a mendelian transmission pattern with an effect on the trait of interest  <cit> . the identification of dna markers linked to tick resistance would provide a better strategy for selecting resistant animals and could lead to the isolation of the genes underlying the resistance to ticks. marker assisted selection  could be used to pre-select young animals, shorten generation interval and increase genetic gain  <cit> . molecular markers have the capacity to allow prediction of breeding value for traits that had previously been difficult to measure and hence were not included in the selection criterion  <cit> . understanding the biological and physiological mechanisms of these resistance genes could help to develop new and more effective acaricides and vaccines. in this study, we report the results of the first whole genome scan that led to the successful identification of six major qtl for tick resistance in the bovine genome.

methods
population
the experimental f <dig> population was produced by crossing four holstein bulls with  <dig> gyr cows to generate  <dig> f <dig>  animals, using multiple ovulation with embryo transfer . four f <dig> bulls were mated to  <dig> f <dig> females to generate  <dig> f <dig> animals, avoiding relationship among sires and cows. all f <dig> animals were raised together in the embrapa dairy cattle experimental station, located in the southeast of brazil. the weather can be divided in two seasons: mild and dry, from april to september, hot and humid, from october to march  <cit> . this population was produced from year  <dig> to  <dig> 

the experimental calves were artificially reared on approximately  <dig> l of whole milk/day in individual houses up to  <dig> weeks of age in a tick free area. from this age up to six months, they were kept in paddocks of cynodon dactylon l, supplemented with protein ration and chopped elephant grass . in these paddocks, they started to have contact with ticks. thereafter, they were kept on pastures of brachiaria decumbens  supplemented with chopped elephant grass and concentrate in the dry season. minerals were made available in the paddocks for all animals. during the period from birth until  <dig> to  <dig> months of age, the f <dig> animals were not treated with any product to control ticks.

phenotype evaluation
to evaluate tick resistance, artificial infestations were performed in each f <dig> animal in the dry and rainy seasons. in this way, each animal was evaluated twice. the phenotypes for tick resistance were determined from  <dig> to  <dig> for  <dig> f <dig> animals based on evaluations in both seasons, distributed in  <dig> age groups. tick evaluations were performed in these two different seasons to check the existence of distinct response mechanisms to tick infestation. the rainy season ranges from october to march; shows elevated temperatures  and average monthly precipitation of  <dig> mm. the dry season ranges from april to september, shows mild temperatures  and average monthly precipitation of  <dig> mm. it can be noted that the temperature between the two seasons are not so different but the monthly precipitation is nearly  <dig> times higher in the rainy season.

infestation order was determined by the formation of each experimental group. this means that some animals had their first infestation in the dry season while some animals had their first infestation in the rainy season. as mentioned in the population topic, the first artificial infestation was not the first contact with ticks since this parasite is normally present on pasture in the experimental station.

animals were evaluated in contemporary groups with age ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> months. artificial infestation was carried out with approximately  <dig>  <dig> rhipicephalus  microplus larvae placed in the dorsal region of each animal. after that, animals were kept tied up for  <dig> min to avoid the self-grooming and to allow the larvae to spread to all regions of the body. after that, they were kept on pastures for  <dig> days when the engorged female ticks were counted  <cit> .

additional traits that might interfere with tick resistance were also evaluated, such as coat color, coat thickness, coat length and hair density. coat color was determined by visual score according with the following classification: 1) totally white; 2) mostly white; 3) mostly dark; and 4) totally dark. coat thickness was determined using a  <dig>  mm precision pachimeter in three different regions of the animal body. this procedure evaluated the height of the lay down hair. coat length was determined measuring the full length of the hair attached to the skin. hair density was determined by removing hair samples from a determined area and counting the number of hair present in that area. these samples were removed from the same spots that coat thickness and coat length were evaluated.

genotyping
blood samples from the parental, f <dig> and f <dig> generations were collected using vacuum tubes containing anti-clotting reagents. genomic dna was extracted from leukocytes using a modified phenol/chloroform method described shortly herein. leukocytes were separated from fresh whole blood and transferred to  <dig> ml tubes. samples were washed with lyses buffer until a white pellet was obtained. pellet was treated with saline-proteinase k buffer and protein was removed by phenol-chloroform treatment. quality and concentration of dna were determined with the genequant pro spectrophotometer .

a total of  <dig> microsatellite markers were selected to cover the autosomal chromosomes with an average marker interval of  <dig> cm. markers were selected from the map available at marc/usda  website: http://www.marc.usda.gov/genome/cattle/cattle.html. this map contains  <dig>  <dig> microsatellite markers spanning  <dig>  <dig> cm and has an average marker density of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . markers were chosen based on their location in the map, multi-allelism and minimum of 50% heterozygosity.

pcr reaction mixture contained  <dig> ng of genomic dna,  <dig>  u of taq dna polymerase,  <dig>  mm of each dntp,  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig>  or  <dig>  mm of mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig>  and  <dig> mm kcl, in a final volume of  <dig> μl. cycling parameters consisted of  <dig> cycles of 94°c for 30", annealing temperature  for 30", 72°c for 30" and a final extension step at 72°c for 45'. forward primers were 5' end labeled with fluorescent markers . the amplification reactions were performed with the geneamp pcr-system  <dig>  and mastercycler .

microsatellite marker alleles were detected by capillary electrophoresis in the megabace  <dig> dna sequencer  or in the abi prism  <dig> avant sequencer .

primer combinations were multiplexed based on the allelic range and fluorescent dyes before electrophoresis. allele genotypes were determined with fragment profiler software  and data were exported to an excel datasheet  for markers analyzed in the megabace  <dig> dna sequencer. for markers analyzed in the abi prism  <dig> avant sequencer, genotypes were determined using genescan  <dig>  and genotyper  <dig> . <dig> software .

linkage map
genetic linkage maps were generated using crimap software  <cit>  available at: http://linkage.rockefeller.edu/soft/crimap/. recombination units were converted to cm using kosambi's mapping function.

statistical analysis
the information content was calculated using the method described by knott et al.  <cit> . allelic frequencies, expected heterozygosity  and polymorphic information content  were calculated for the population using cervus  <dig>  software  <cit> .

tick count data did not follow normal distribution, so data was normalized using natural logarithmic transformation: log  . hereafter the transformed data were called log-tick. to determine if phenotypic data from rainy and dry seasons could be used as repetitive evaluations, the correlation between counts made in the same individual in two seasons was estimated using pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.

analysis of variance  for tick resistance was performed using the proc glm function of sas software , employing the general model: y = xb + e, where y is the dependent variable , x is the incidence matrix of the fixed effects  and covariates , and "e" is the random error ~ . the significant sources of variation obtained from this analysis were used in the qtl analysis.

qtl detection
qtl were mapped by regression analysis  <cit>  using the f <dig> data analysis option available in the gridqtl software http://www.gridqtl.org.uk <cit> . qtl alleles were assumed to be fixed or highly skewed in frequency between the breeds  <cit> . one-qtl model was computed in every cm along the chromosome.

f statistics was calculated to test the hypothesis of qtl segregation using a restricted model including year/group as fixed effect and coat thickness as covariate for both dry and rainy seasons. in addition, coat color was included as fixed effect in dry season only. additive and additive + dominant effects were considered to detect qtl associated with tick resistance. the following models were used:

additive:  

additive + dominant:  

where,

yijk = phenotype 

μ = constant

gi = year/group effect;

cj= coat color effect j: j =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  4; 

b = is the regression coefficient of y on t,

t = coat thickness

eijk = error

ca and cd are functions of conditional probabilities of qtl given the marker genotypes, calculated as follows:  

where:

p = is the probability of homozygosis for the qtl genotypes derived from holstein grandparents given the marker ;

p = is the probability of homozygosis for the qtl genotypes derived from gyr grandparents given the marker ;

p = is the probability of heterozygosis for the qtl genotypes given the marker ;

the significance thresholds for 95% and 99% chromosome-wide significance were computed based on  <dig>  <dig> permutations  <cit>  and the confidence interval was estimated using the chi-square drop approximation  <cit> .

the proportion of phenotypic variance was calculated using the formula   <cit> .

the p-value for a genome-wide  significance level was obtained using the bonferroni correction  <cit> .  

where r is the proportion of total genome length attributed to the chromosome.

RESULTS
marker genotypes
the whole genome scan with  <dig> microsatellite markers generated  <dig>  <dig> alleles with an average of  <dig>  alleles/marker. all markers showed a segregation ratio of 1:2: <dig> with no segregation distortion. marker cyp <dig> showed the highest number of alleles  and marker dik <dig> showed the lowest number of alleles  . for most cases, the number of alleles found in the f <dig> population was smaller than the number of alleles reported on marc map . this high allelic variation found on marc map was somehow expected since it was generated from many breeds of cattle  <cit> . a small number of founder animals  from two cattle breeds  were used to generate the f <dig> population and, because of that, a smaller number of alleles were found in this population in comparison to marc data.

the total number of alleles and the allele frequency  were different among populations - holstein, gyr, f <dig> and f <dig>  the average number of alleles found in the holstein population was  <dig>  alleles/marker while the gyr population showed a higher diversity of  <dig>  alleles/marker. this discrepancy in the allele number between these two populations might be due to different number of sampled animals in each population . for the f <dig> and f <dig> populations, the average number of alleles was  <dig>  alleles/marker. it was found a great variation for the allele frequencies between the parental populations indicating a great diversity between holstein and gyr breeds  <cit> .

in f <dig> populations, qtl mapping is based on the genetic variation among founder lineages and requires that the parental populations carry fixed alternate alleles at the qtl  <cit> . nevertheless, f <dig> populations are not generally formed by 100% contrasting lineages or breeds. this fact was well noticed in this study since 25% of the detected alleles were shared between the two parental breeds gyr and holstein. a total of  <dig> marker alleles  were found only in the gyr breed and  <dig> alleles were found only in the holstein breed.

for the f <dig> population, the average value of pic was  <dig> . marker cyp <dig> showed the highest pic value  and marker bmc <dig> showed the lowest pic value  . suggested pic value classes are: pic >  <dig>  ;  <dig>  < pic <  <dig>   and pic <  <dig>    <cit> . according to these criteria, the great majority of markers genotyped in the f <dig> population might be considered highly polymorphic. pic values are the most common indexes to determine the extent of the polymorphism of a marker  <cit>  and the usefulness of a marker in segregation analysis is directly related to its level of polymorphism. despite of the small number of gyr founder animals, it is possible to select markers with high pic values and high number of alleles to set a panel for paternity tests and genealogy studies in this breed. markers bm <dig>  iobt <dig>  nlbcmk <dig>  cyp <dig> and dik <dig> fit these criteria and could be selected for that.

all chromosome linkage maps generated in this study with the f <dig> population agreed in marker order with the marc/usda bovine linkage maps. bta  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed approximately the same length as the marc map. bta  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were found to be larger compared to marc map. bta  <dig> and  <dig> were the only linkage maps found to be shorter than marc maps . this was somehow expected since the f <dig> population generated a smaller number of recombinant meioses compared to marc map.

tick resistance phenotype
the average number of ticks did not differ between the two seasons, with average values of  <dig> ±  <dig> in the dry season and  <dig> ±  <dig> in the rainy season. in natural infestations, it is normally found a seasonal effect on tick number per animal with higher numbers found in the dry season  <cit> . these different results may be explained by the great influence of environmental factors in the tick free life cycle that affect the number of larvae. in this work, the animals were artificially inoculated with  <dig>  <dig> larvae each. the absence of difference between the average tick counts in the two seasons may reflect a higher effect of environment factors in larvae population and viability in the pasture than the larvae survival in the host contributing to differences in natural infestations.

the estimated heritability for tick resistance in the f <dig> population was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  log-tick indicating genetic variation for this trait. the average heritability for tick resistance from several studies reviewed by davis  <cit>  was  <dig> .

the correlation between log-tick in the two seasons was low  indicating that the evaluations in each season are distinct phenotypes. considering this result, we did not include consecutive tick counts as repetitive evaluations and all analyses were performed separately for rainy and dry season. although the average number of ticks in the two seasons was the same, the individual animal response was different for each season. once our results suggest that the environmental conditions did not affect the parasite life cycle it is possible to consider that these individual variation were related to seasonal variations in the immunological response of the f <dig> animals against tick challenge.

the analysis of variance  indicated that year/group, coat color and coat thickness affected the log-tick in the dry season while only year/group and coat thickness affected the log-tick in the rainy season. animals with whiter coat color showed less ticks than animals with dark coat color . these results agree with other works indicating that white coat color animals showed less ticks in relation to dark coat color animals  <cit> . according to these authors, the higher susceptibility to tick of dark coat color animals could be probably caused by a decrease in the level of resistance since these animals might be more affected by the heat stress in the rainy season. some properties of the hair coat and coat color in cattle enhance conductive and convective heat loss and reduce absorption of solar radiation  <cit> . another explanation would be that in whiter animals ticks are more visible to predators such as birds if compared to animals with dark coat color  <cit> .

# degrees of freedom

ns - non-significant

coat thickness showed significant effect on the tick count in both rainy and dry seasons . it has been reported that animals with short hair are more resistant to ticks than animals with long hair  <cit> . according to these authors, a thicker coat might favor the parasite since it creates a microclimate that helps keeping the parasite attached to the surface of the animal. in addition, thicker coat complicates the animal's self-grooming that helps removing attached ticks.

it was somehow expected that the response of the animals would be different between the first and second artificial infestation, but this has not been verified. according to bonsma & pretorius  <cit> , bovine tick resistance can be innate or acquired. the level of resistance increases after various infestations compared to the resistance level at the first infestation  <cit> . this was not found in this study since the infestation order was non-significant in the anova. one likely reason for this result would be that the f <dig> animals had already been in contact with ticks naturally present in pastures before being artificially infested. thus, the first artificial infestation was not the first contact of the animal with the parasite.

qtl mapping
the interval analysis was able to identify qtl regions for tick resistance with distinct results in the dry and rainy seasons. we identified six qtl, three in the rainy season, two in the dry season and one in both seasons. three qtl were identified with chromosome-wide significance pc <  <dig>  on bta  <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig> and three qtl were identified with genome-wide significance pg <  <dig>  on bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig>  summarized results of f-value, qtl location, confidence interval and qtl effects from significant qtl found are shown in table  <dig>  graphic results of the detected qtl are shown in the figures  <dig> through  <dig> in detail.

on bta <dig>  a qtl  for the dry season was detected in the middle of the chromosome  under the additive plus dominance model. the additive effect was not significant indicating that this qtl has dominant effect, which according to the model used, implies that heterozygous animals show a lower number of ticks when compared to the average of homozygous individuals. this qtl explains  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation for the trait . the average log-tick for this chromosome was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and the dominant effect associated to the qtl causes a change in the average of - <dig> .

on bta <dig>  a qtl  for the rainy season was detected near the telomeric end of the chromosome , using the additive model. this qtl explains  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation for the trait . the additive effect is negative, indicating that alleles originated from holstein cause a decrease in the number of ticks. this was the only one case among the qtl described here were holstein alleles decreased the average tick count. finding these holstein derived resistance alleles was somewhat unexpected since this breed is less resistant to ticks compared to gyr breed. this qtl would require a deeper investigation in order to understand the inheritance of resistance attributed to this region.

on bta <dig>  two qtl peaks  for the dry season were detected under the additive model . this qtl explains  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation for the trait . the additive effect was positive, indicating that alleles originated from holstein contributed to increase in the number of ticks/animal. these two peaks suggest that two qtl might be explaining the variation for the trait. new markers should be added in this region to decrease the confidence interval and determine the number of qtl involved on bta  <dig> 

on bta <dig>  a qtl  for the rainy season was detected in the central part of the chromosome , using the additive model. this qtl explains  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation for the trait . the average log-tick for this chromosome was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and additive effect causes a change in the average of  <dig> .

bta  <dig> was the only chromosome in which significant qtl  were found on both rainy and dry seasons . the phenotypic variation explained by this qtl was  <dig> % for the dry season and  <dig> % for the rainy season. the additive effect was positive indicating that tick resistance was originated from gyr alleles. in this same chromosome, it was detected an interaction of bola drb <dig> gene with tick resistance in this same f <dig> population  <cit> . bola drb <dig> gene belongs to bovine histocompatibility complex and is directly related to inflammatory processes. these loci encode for surface molecules relevant in the induction and regulation of the immune response  <cit> . acosta-rodriguez et al.  <cit>  showed that some mhc bola class ii alleles determine, at least partly, the susceptibility to tick infestation. bola class i alleles w <dig>  and w <dig> have been related to tick protection. cattle with antigens w <dig>  and w <dig> had significantly fewer ticks than cattle lacking these antigens  <cit> . the bola complex is located on bta23q <dig>  and maps within the confidence interval of this qtl indicating that a gene or genes of this complex might be underlying this qtl. fine mapping of this region with additional markers should help to deeper understand this possible interaction.

on bta <dig>  a qtl  for the rainy season was detected in the beginning part of the chromosome , using additive model. this qtl explains  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation for the trait . apparently, the distribution of f values along the chromosome for both wet and dry seasons show the same pattern although significant value was detected only in the rainy season.

gasparin et al.  <cit>  genotyped selected chromosomes and detected tick resistance qtl on bta <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> using this same embrapa f <dig> population. these results were based on preliminary phenotypic data of  <dig> f <dig> animals and included putative qtl with higher threshold . regitano et al.  <cit>  reported additional ongoing results using this same population and detected qtl on bta  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with chromosome-wide threshold ranging from  <dig>  < p <  <dig> . after publication of these partial results, additional  <dig> animals were phenotyped and the remaining chromosomes were genotyped in order to cover the whole bovine genome. additional miss paternities that arouse from the new marker genotype information were discarded. the association studies were re-processed and we were able to calculate the genome-wide threshold for each chromosome. we detected various putative qtl  and some of them were the ones previously reported by gasparin et al.  <cit>  and regitano et al.  <cit>  . in this current work, we only report highly significant qtl detected below 1% chromosome-wide threshold to minimize the chance of detecting false-positive qtl.

the use of qtl information detected in a line cross is less directly applicable to a pure breed population compared to a qtl detected in the same breed of interest. nevertheless, the qtl results detected in our f <dig> population  could be more easily transferred to commercial herds of dairy cattle in brazil, since the vast majority of these herds are constituted by gyr × holstein crosses.

fine mapping with additional markers in regions where significant qtl were detected for tick resistance could increase the level of significance for qtl as well as decrease the confidence interval. this would greatly increase the applicability of markers assisted selection by lowering the probability of occurrence of crossing over between the marker and qtl. analysis of data from different breeds or populations might also provide additional insights into the genes controlling the trait of interest. in addition, the refinement of qtl position will allow a more precise location of the qtl limits, thus aiding in the identification of orthologous genes  <cit>  into segments of human or mice, which can provide a list of candidate genes that may explain the effect of qtl for tick resistance.

bovine resistance to ticks is a complex mechanism and a variety of physiological pathways might be directly involved such as general inflammatory reactions that could avoid or make difficult the fixation of tick in the animal. in this way, many immunology related genes described in other species may be related to bovine tick resistance.

the recent release of the bovine genomic sequencing project  <cit>  and the hapmap project  <cit> , which made available ultra high-density snp chips, will facilitate the search for the causative mutations underlying the qtl and help understanding the physiological mechanisms involved in bovine tick resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully identified six qtl regions strongly associated with tick resistance in cattle on the chromosomes bta  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  qtl located on bta  <dig> might be related with the bovine histocompatibility complex. further investigation of these qtl will help to isolate genes involved in tick resistance mechanisms in cattle.
