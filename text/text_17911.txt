BACKGROUND
microarray gene expression data can provide a global view of transcriptional regulation, but new methods of analysis are needed to extract biologically meaningful information. the dna sequence elements that act as binding sites for transcription factors  coordinate the expression of genes having one or more such elements in their promoter region  <cit> . systematic approaches to identifying the biological functions of tfs are needed to ensure rapid progress from genome sequence data to direct experiments and applications  <cit> .

a popular approach to analyzing microarray data at present is to cluster genes based on the similarities of their expression profiles. it has been used to identify cis-regulatory elements. the rationale is that co-expressed genes are likely to be co-regulated and, therefore, may share common regulatory elements  <cit> . in addition, eisen et al.  <cit>  constructed a probabilistic model that uses expression data to link regulators to regulated genes. their method assumes that the expression levels of regulated genes depend on the expression levels of their regulators. these methods cannot reliably distinguish among genes that have similar expression patterns but are under the control of different regulatory networks. recently, the genome-wide location analysis of dna-binding motifs offers new information for identifying regulatory relationships, such as trans-/cis- regulatory networks. the chip-chip method identifies the interactions between tfs and dna binding regions, providing strong direct evidence for genetic regulation  <cit> . although helpful, the usefulness of binding information is also limited, because the presence of the regulator at a promoter region indicates binding but not necessarily function. the environment conditions under which these tfs will interact with the cis-elements  are still not clear. the regulator may act positively, negatively or not at all  <cit> .

elucidating the regulation of genes and eventually deciphering the entire gene regulatory network will reveal the functions of genes during internal transcriptional processes and responses to external environmental stimuli. however, in order to analyze the functions of a target gene of interest, one first needs to understand the gene regulation network, which is a formidable task by conventional methods. the initial step towards the goal of understanding gene regulation is to identify the relationship between a tf and its target genes. many tfs bind to specific sites in the genome to regulate gene expression. for example, they bind to specific motifs on promoter sequences and recruit chromatin modifying complexes and the transcription apparatus to initiate rna synthesis  <cit> . the reprogramming of gene expression that occurs as cells move through the cell cycle, or when cells respond to changes in their environments, is effected in part by changes in the dna binding status of trans-acting activators. recently, the databases such as scpd  <cit>  and transfac  <cit>  have been established to collect information from the literature about tfs with regard to their target genes and binding sites. however, experimental identification of tfs and their functions is slow and laborious. therefore, prediction methods have become increasingly important, especially after the emergence of high throughput technologies, such as dna microarrays, and binding site motif information  <cit> . nguyen and d'haeseleer  <cit>  have integrated genome-wide location data and motif binding sequence to infer the strength dependency of motif position and orientation and then focus on individual motif regulatory ability of the target gene. in this study, our goal is to develop an efficient systematic method that can integrate these data sources to detect tfs and their synergistic activities to gain more insight into the mechanism via constructing trans-regulatory networks of tfs responding to an environmental change.

recently, bussemaker et al.  <cit>  proposed to use a linear regression model to identify binding motifs correlated with gene expression. although this method successfully discovered some motifs corresponding to known binding sites and predicted some new motifs, they did not find their tf functions and interactions in diverse environments. the ability to adapt to osmotic changes in the surrounding medium and the heat shock due to sudden environmental temperature change is fundamental to life. to properly control gene expression, the cell has to sense osmotic or thermal changes and transmit the signal to the nucleus. recently, tfs that are required for the stimulation of gene expression after the osmotic and heat shock have been described  <cit> . in recent studies, systems biology method and computational systems biology schemes have been widely used to construct dynamic models for gene regulatory networks  <cit> . in this study, utilizing the binding site motif information  <cit>  and the microarray data  <cit>  of different environmental stresses, we detect the activities of tfs under different stresses by quantifying their regulatory abilities and interactive activities. from the systems biology perspective, the tfs that are active under multiple environmental stresses can also be detected by a cross identification method. we can not only identify the individual interaction tf strength but also rank the tfs which are responsible to the specific stress. in addition, we can also estimate the crosstalk relationships among different pathways responsible to specific environmental stresses.

RESULTS
in this study, we consider seven different environmental or physiological conditions on yeast to demonstrate the performance of our method; the major conditions are osmotic stress, heat shock stress, hydrogen peroxide treatment, and cell cycle. tf activities are recognized by constructing an interactive dynamic model among the target genes and candidate tfs via a set of yeast dna-binding motif information and microarray data. because the temporal microarray data can be represented as a result of the interactive dynamic modeling, it is easy to discern the stress-specific tfs and the role of activator or repressor by estimating the regulatory abilities and interactive activities by the maximum likelihood estimation. the significant tfs responsible for a specific environmental stress is also detected for a target gene by minimizing the akaike information criterion  to achieve the real order of the interactive dynamic model via the system identification method.

in this work, the detected tfs are divided into two parts:  the stress-specific tfs, which are based on the statistical results in figure  <dig>  and  the common transcriptional activators in table  <dig>  furthermore, the detected interactive activities among these tfs are presented in table  <dig>  in this study, we focus on detecting the stress-specific tfs and the common transcriptional activators that are always activative in the gene transcription process even in the absence of any specific stress; these common tfs can also be easily found by the conventional statistical method. for example, our proposed method can easily find the common tfs abf <dig>  rap <dig>  cin <dig>  fhl <dig> and reb <dig>  <cit>  in osmotic shock, heat shock, hydrogen peroxide treatment and cell cycle in table  <dig>  the interactive activities of these tfs under different environmental conditions are ranked in interactive activities matrices in table  <dig>  in addition, our method also can order the relative roles of the tfs in stress-specific genes of the transcriptional regulatory system. in the following, we will analyze the stress-specific tfs in response to seven different stresses.

* the transcription factors confirmed by the literature or experimental results.

common transcription activators are tfs that always activate without any specific stress induction and are also ordered by their regulatory significance.

* the interactivities confirmed by the literature or experimental results.

significant tfs under different environmental changes
under osmotic stress
our study indicates that the yeast genes that respond to hyper- and hypo-osmotic shock are regulated by the major tfs listed in table  <dig>  skn <dig> has a high detected frequency under an osmotic stress, implying that skn <dig> is a strong regulator for osmotic stress. experimental evidence suggests that skn7p is controlled by the sln1p-ypd1p osmosensing phosphorelay system and osmotic signals  <cit> . the function of skn7p is opposite to the pathway responding to high osmolarity but is in parallel to a pathway responding to low osmolarity. the sln1p-ypd1p-skn7p system is a genuine two-component  system mediating osmotic responses to a transcriptional regulator  <cit> . skn <dig> appears to function as a tf, because it can bind to promoter elements  <cit>  and can activate the transcription of reporter genes  <cit> . this ability to activate transcription is influenced by mutations at the phosphorylation site  of the skn <dig> receiver domain, and this finding leads to the prediction that a histidine protein kinase directs the phosphorylation of skn <dig>  <cit> . however, the identity of this kinase remains to be confirmed.

smp <dig> is the second most important tf in response to the hyper-osmotic stress . exposure of s. cerevisiae to strong extracellular osmolarity activates the stress-activated high-osmolarity glycerol  in mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway, which is essential for cell survival upon osmotic stress. yeast cells respond to osmotic stress by inducing the expressions of a very large number of genes, in which tf smp <dig> binds to hog <dig>  under the control of mapk. experimental results confirm that the relevant hog <dig> phosphorylation sites in smp <dig> have an obvious effect on stress-regulated gene expression  <cit> . hence, smp <dig> also plays an important role in osmotic-stress responses.

similarly, yap <dig>  a member of the yeast activator protein  family, and hsf <dig>  phd <dig>  mbp <dig>  etc. also have indirect experimental evidence to confirm that they are related to osmotic stress  <cit> . hence, in the osmotic-stress environmental stimulation, our proposed method is very efficient to detect significant tfs.

under heat shock stress
the heat shock stress is another external environment stimulus in general. in table  <dig>  hsf <dig> is found in front of other tfs, indicating that hsf <dig> is the most significant tf in response to heat shock stress. this prediction is in agreement with the experimental evidence that the expression of the major heat shock proteins , which have been classified according to their molecular mass as hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  the hsp <dig> family, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig>  <cit> , is controlled by hsf <dig>  which binds to cis-acting heat shock control elements  present in the promoters of these genes  <cit> .

similarly, skn <dig> has previously been shown to play a role in the induction of heat stress-responsive genes in yeast. hsf <dig> and skn <dig> share certain structural similarities, particularly in their dna-binding domains and at the adjacent regions of coiled-coil structure, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

in addition, we find another tf mac <dig> in table  <dig>  whose n-terminal region is highly similar to the copper and dna binding domains of ace <dig> and amt <dig>  loss-of-function mutants of mac <dig> have a defect in the plasma membrane cu and the reductase activity fe, which are slow growing, respiratory deficient, and hypersensitive to heat  <cit> . moreover, we can also find that the significant tf gcn <dig> is also considered as a stress-responsive tf  <cit> . obviously, these significant stress tfs can be detected by our method.

under mixed stresses
we also investigated tfs under other stress conditions, including mild heat shock at variable similarity and hydrogen peroxide treatment. using our method, we can easily find a very significant tf skn <dig>  further, in the hydrogen peroxide  treatment, we can also find hsf <dig>  these two tfs are always ranked as the first or the second in table  <dig>  cells must survive under challenges from the environment with regard to heat and hydrogen peroxide. skn <dig> has previously been shown to play a role in the induction of stress-responsive genes in yeast, e.g., in the induction of the thioredoxin gene in response to hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . these two regulatory trans-activators, skn <dig> and hsf <dig>  share certain structural similarities, particularly in their dna-binding domains and in the presence of adjacent regions of the coiled-coil structure, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> . furthermore, raitt et al .  <cit>  showed that skn <dig> can bind to the same heat shock regulatory sequences as hsf <dig>  and that skn <dig> and hsf <dig> cooperate to achieve a maximal induction of heat shock genes in response specific to oxidative stress and interact with each other in the nucleus under normal growth conditions as well as during oxidative stress.

under cell cycle
our method identified several tfs that have previously been identified as major cell cycle controlling tfs, including mcm <dig>  swi <dig>  mbp <dig>  swi <dig>  fkh <dig>  and fkh <dig>  <cit> . these tfs are activators in the cell cycle. besides, we also find the common transcriptional activators abf <dig>  rap <dig> and reb <dig>  which also play important roles in the transcription of genes in the cell cycle of yeast  <cit> . for example, abf <dig> has a positive regulation of the genes that are involved in protein synthesis and transport, glycolysis, fermentation, energy pathways and cell wall organization  <cit> . this abf <dig> function was also inferred by wei and kaznessis  <cit> . on the other hand, reb <dig> is an essential transcription factor that interacts with the clb <dig> upstream regulatory sequence  outside the g2/m control region  <cit> . obviously, these cell cycle controlling tfs can be detected by our method.

synergistic tf pairs under specific environmental changes
we now consider the interactivities of these significant tfs in the cell cycle . the interactivity between mcm <dig> and ndd <dig> has the strongest regulatory ability in the cell cycle. according to experimental data, mcm <dig>  together with fkh <dig>  recruits ndd <dig> in late g <dig> and controls the transcription of g2/m genes  <cit> . the interaction between fkh <dig> and ndd <dig> has the second strongest regulatory ability according to our results. furthermore, we also find strong interactivities between swi <dig> and swi <dig>  and between mbp <dig> and swi <dig> . according to the conventional results in the yeast cell cycle, complexes of swi <dig> and swi <dig>  as well as mbp <dig> and swi <dig> , both of which are heterodimers, are active during the g1/s phase  <cit> . thus, the interactivity of tfs can be accurately detected by our method.

cross-talks and interactions
from the results in table  <dig>  we can find that many tfs are detected in different environmental conditions, including skn <dig>  hsf <dig>  phd <dig>  hap <dig>  gcn <dig>  mbp <dig>  etc. . it implies that they may be cross-talks or interactions among the stress response pathways, such as the high osmolarity glycerol  pathway and the heat shock response pathway. although they respond to different conditions, they may be induced by the same tfs. this cross-talk phenomenon may imply interactions among tfs. in table  <dig>  we find that skn <dig> and hsf <dig> are detected in the heat shock stress and hydrogen peroxide treatment; a previous study  <cit>  showed that skn <dig> and hsf <dig> cooperate to achieve the maximal induction of heat shock genes in response to hydrogen peroxide stress specifically. in addition, skn <dig> and hsf <dig> share certain structural similarities in their dna-binding. therefore, from tables  <dig> and  <dig>  we can infer that several tfs may have cross-talks and interactions in different pathways induced by environmental stresses .

discussion
in contrast to current methods, our new method is capable of extracting significant regulatory abilities and interactivities of tfs under different environmental conditions. for this reason, the analysis and interpretation of output expression profiles become straightforward, so that our method has a high potential for application. it may also be useful for studying the cross-talks between pathways controlled by the same regulatory tfs.

the contributions of this study include the followings:  a nonlinear dynamical model is developed for a transcription regulatory system in terms of regulatory abilities and interactivities among tfs,  a systematic identification method is proposed to detect the specific-stress regulation tfs and their interactivities,  a searching method for tfs is developed by the proposed dynamic transcriptional regulatory system,  the proposed method can rank the frequencies of tfs that correspond to a specific stress and thus can identify the major tfs. similarly, it can rank the frequencies of interactions between tfs and thus identify the major tf pairs, and  cross-talks and interactions among different environment-stress inducing pathways can also be estimated by detecting the regulatory tfs. the main advantage of our method over current methods is that the transcriptional regulatory system is constructed with the genome-wide structure using the expression profiles and chip-chip data, and the gene regulatory system can obtain extra dynamic information to meet the dynamic regulations and interactivities of genetic networks under environmental stresses.

however, we have weaknesses or poor results in some cases. for example, in table  <dig>  we find tfs ixr <dig> and dot <dig>  these detected specific-stress tfs cannot be confirmed by current experimental data to validate the function annotation. a possible reason may be that the use of both cubic spline interpolation to avoid overfitting and linear transformation of microarray data in our scheme has introduced new noises and distortions. furthermore, some estimated tfs and their interactivities may influence the specific-stress pathway indirectly but cannot be detected by experiment directly. in addition, the binding motif information might be incomplete, and the tf-binding site number and location are not sufficient to construct the complete transcriptional regulatory system with regard to the genes under study. therefore, the lack of complete tf binding site information makes it difficult construct an accurate dynamic interactive equation to estimate tf activities. the estimated false positive and false negative rates of these first  <dig> tfs for specific environmental stresses are given in table  <dig>  since the tfs of the cell cycle and hyper-osmotic shock are better known at present, the estimates of their tfs can be evaluated. from table  <dig>  we find a small false positive rate and a larger false negative rate. the performance may be improved by finding more tfs in the literature or/and by increasing the estimate of significant tfs. on the other hand, the current literature and experimental data are not sufficient to confirm our results by the proposed method. at present, we only provide the prediction results of the tfs' interaction for future research.

in the future, if more complete binding motif data and more accurate and longer gene expression profile data become available, we will be able to improve the construction of the transcription regulatory system and get more interactive information of tfs under different environmental conditions. also, our approach may be extended to constructing transcriptional regulatory systems in more diverse conditions and more complex eukaryotes. after transcription factors and their interactivities are accurately detected by explicit dynamical equations, some applications will become straightforward.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a dynamic system model is developed to describe the regulatory ability and interactivity of tfs for each gene expressed in a specific stress due to environmental changes. based on the proposed dynamic system model and microarray data as well as information of all possible binding sites, we could find significant stress-specific and cell cycle-controlled tfs through ranking the frequencies of tfs of all genes, which are expressed under a specific stress. similarly, the significant interactivities of tfs under a specific stress are also found by ranking the frequencies of interactions of all tfs. most of the results are confirmed by the literature. further, the cross-talks of tfs among different stresses are also detected, which deserve further research. the proposed tf detection method is a systems biology approach because all possible tfs of all genes are considered through microarray and chip-chip data and a system identification method is used to estimate the parameters of the dynamic system model. the results of our proposed approach are suitable for deciphering regulatory functions, interactivities and cross-talks of tfs that respond to different environmental stresses.
