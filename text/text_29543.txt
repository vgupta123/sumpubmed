BACKGROUND
traditional plant breeding relies on the discovery, phenotypic selection, and introgression of desirable traits to develop superior cultivars . this process usually takes 7- <dig> years and significant economic resources  <cit> . however, the application of marker-assisted selection , for the detection of genes or genomic regions underlying a trait of interest, can increase the genetic gain over phenotypic selection in breeding programs by reducing time and costs  <cit> .

in the past three decades, molecular markers have been employed in common bean  for studies of genetic diversity, germplasm characterization, genetic mapping of major genes or quantitative trait loci  controlling agronomic traits or tolerance to abiotic stresses, and tagging and mas of disease resistance genes . early discovery of molecular markers  often focused on variation between genetically distant materials from different market classes belonging to the middle american and andean gene pools  <cit> . in the past, genetic maps were mostly generated from wide crosses and were not sufficiently dense with markers. in addition, markers linked to a given trait were often times not found in other unrelated populations, restricting their potential use for mas  <cit>  to certain populations or gene pools in common bean.

as an alternative to bi-parental linkage mapping for the identification of markers tightly linked to monogenic and quantitative disease resistance loci, bean geneticists developed molecular tagging methods utilizing several types of segregating populations, including f <dig>  near-isogenic lines , backcrossed inbred lines , and recombinant inbred lines  , often in combination with bulked segregant analysis  . bsa was originally developed to identify markers linked to disease resistance genes in plants, without the need of a genetic map, and consisted of genotyping two bulks, each containing individual plants with extreme phenotypes . polymorphic markers detected between the bulks are often located in genomic regions linked to the trait, and then candidate markers are screened across the original segregating population and additional lines and populations to confirm the marker-trait linkage  <cit> . these markers were also used, together with already available framework maps, to estimate the genomic position of disease resistance loci onto the consensus genetic map of common bean  <cit> .

since the tagging of the ur- <dig> bean rust  gene  <cit>  many markers linked to genes and qtl controlling resistance to fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens were developed by bsa approach using rapd markers  <cit> . the conversion of rapd to scar  markers facilitated mas  for the development of bean germplasm or cultivars with enhanced resistance or combined resistance to several pathogens  <cit> . however, the efficiency of mas for breeding disease resistance in common bean is still hampered due to the dominance of many rapd/scar markers, repulsion phase linkage between markers and dominant traits, continued need for progeny testing, and the realization that some markers are loosely linked in distinct mapping populations and/or ineffective in specific market classes or gene pools . the development of novel disease resistance markers or the refinement of existing ones would benefit from the availability of highly polymorphic marker systems that generate codominant, more tightly linked, and broadly applicable markers.

next-generation sequencing  allows the rapid development and application of genomics tools in plant breeding  <cit> . it enables the inexpensive and rapid discovery of dna polymorphisms such as simple sequence repeats , insertion-deletions , and single nucleotide polymorphisms  in model crops  <cit> , including common bean  <cit> . using the recently released reference genome sequence of common bean  <cit>  markers can now be assigned physical genomic positions and candidate genes identified.

bsa and the ngs technology were recently applied to mapping and marker development for disease resistance loci in several crops . by using restriction-site associated dna  sequencing in a ril population of lupin, markers tightly linked  to anthracnose  and phomopsis stem blight  resistances were rapidly developed  <cit> . in rice, a major qtl for partial resistance to rice blast  was identified in a ril population subjected to whole-genome sequencing  <cit> . in order to minimize costs for ngs sequencing of complex genomes, bsa has also been coupled with transcriptional profiles from rna-seq data for mapping of qtl and mutant genes of agronomic interest in crops .

as a result of massive discovery of polymorphisms by ngs, high-throughput genotyping platforms for genome-wide screening of snps were developed for crop species  <cit> . for common bean, a golden gate snp assay containing  <dig>  working snps, discovered by comparing snps between breeding lines jalo epp <dig>  and bat <dig>  was released  <cit> . recently, the common bean coordinated agricultural project  consortium developed an illumina infinium beadchip  containing  <dig>  snps  <cit> . the snps were identified using whole-genome sequence analysis of  <dig> cultivars from different market classes and gene pools. this high-density snp array provides greater whole genome coverage over previous marker systems. the beancap diversity panel, consisting of over  <dig> common bean lines, was genotyped with the barcbean6k_ <dig> snp chip and is being mainly utilized for association mapping studies and mapping select traits in bi-parental ril populations .

the genome-wide snp coverage of common bean provides an opportunity to discover snps underlying genomic regions of disease resistance traits previously identified by qtl mapping. a rapid method to discover or refine markers linked to common bean disease resistance genes would be the application of “in silico bsa”, which consists of inspecting snp variation among genotyped individuals, with known phenotype, at specific targeted genomic regions. this approach circumvents the need to develop mapping populations or genotype the original population from which the gene or qtl region was identified.

resistance to bcmv and bean common mosaic necrosis virus  is genetically well defined, and conditioned by a single dominant  and four recessive  genes  <cit> . different alleles were identified for two of the loci . the chromosomal position of the i gene, bc- <dig> and bc- <dig> genes map independently  <cit> . the i gene confers immune or hypersensitive resistance to all strains of bcmv and bcmnv and is located on chromosome pv <dig>  <cit>  within a complex locus containing a cluster of nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat -type disease resistance genes   <cit> . a scar marker  linked to the i gene was developed  <cit>  and is widely used by bean breeders  <cit> . however, in several mapping populations, recombination between the sw <dig> marker and i gene was detected  <cit> . furthermore, due to the dominant nature of the marker there is still the need to perform progeny testing in order to identify homozygous resistant plants. therefore, a codominant marker more tightly linked to the i gene will be more informative than current dominant markers, and more accurate in predicting the disease reaction to bcmv.

as a proof of concept, in silico bsa was conducted on the beancap panel to discover snps tightly linked to the chromosomal region underlying the i gene, with the aim of developing codominant markers with broad applicability for mas of the i gene across the different market classes and gene pools of common bean. we discovered such snps and validated their linkage with the i gene segregating in a ril population. finally, kasp  and caps  markers were developed from one of the snp markers tightly linked with the i gene and successfully validated in a subset of lines from the beancap panel and in the ril population.

greenhouse screening for bcmv resistance
greenhouse screening for bcmv/bcmnv resistance with strain nl- <dig> of bcmnv accurately discriminated between resistant genotypes  and susceptible  genotypes. systemic necrosis in genotypes with the i gene  developed as early as five days post inoculation , whereas vein necrosis  and local lesions  developed within  <dig> dpi.

all bcmv differentials and genotypes from the beancap panel initially screened in the greenhouse reacted as expected . in addition, the remaining beancap genotypes, with known or unknown reaction to nl- <dig> strain, showed distinct disease symptoms that correlated with a haplotype associated with i gene resistance or susceptibility. all genotypes in this study appeared to be fixed for resistance  or susceptibility , as all inoculated plants for each genotype displayed the same disease reaction.table  <dig>

conversion of select snp into kasp and caps markers
the closest snp  that consistently cosegregated with the i gene was ss <dig> , and therefore it was targeted for development of kasp and caps markers. the g allele was associated with susceptible genotypes, whereas the resistant genotypes were associated with a allele. the reference genotype g <dig>  used for whole genome sequencing of p. vulgaris, has the g allele. a kasp marker assay was developed, and select lines with known disease reaction to bcmv were initially screened. this allelic-specific assay detected each allele cosegregating with either i gene resistance  or susceptibility  in all genotypes screened with the kasp marker .table  <dig>

amplification with the primers developed for the caps marker produced a single pcr amplicon of the expected  <dig> bp size. digestion of the pcr products for select lines with taqi endonuclease detected the snp associated with the bcmv-resistant allele , generating two bands of  <dig> and  <dig> bp. in contrast, pcr products from susceptible lines  were not cut by taqi due to the alteration of the restriction site . as expected, this marker was able to distinguish between resistant and susceptible genotypes in both the beancap panel and the ril population .figure  <dig>

linkage between marker and igene locus
initially, we screened the beancap genotypes and ril population with sw <dig> marker, which is a dominant marker in coupling phase with the i gene. in general, the presence or absence of sw <dig> marker corresponded to the known phenotype for plants screened in the greenhouse . however, the sw <dig> marker was not detected in five resistant genotypes from the subset of the beancap collection, belonging to races durango/jalisco of the middle american gene pool; also, the sw <dig> marker was present in a single susceptible ril individual  .

all  <dig> genotypes screened in the greenhouse for bcmv resistance , and  <dig> rils from the g122 × montcalm population, were also genotyped with the kasp and caps markers. the kasp assay distinguished resistant and susceptible genotypes in all cases. likewise, the caps marker completely distinguished resistant  or susceptible  genotypes. finally, based on the cosegregation of phenotype and snp markers in the ril population, the snp was tightly linked to the genomic region underlying the i gene as no recombinant individuals were detected.

discussion
we used in silico bsa to discover snp variation within the genomic region associated with bcmv resistance in a diverse collection of germplasm. this approach led to the development of a tightly linked-codominant genetic marker. our results demonstrate that we can take advantage of the extensive information of gene/qtl mapping for disease resistance traits in common bean  <cit>  and the power of in silico bsa of ngs data as a rapid and low-cost approach for marker development.

the rate of marker discovery in common bean was hampered in the past by a lack of a reference genome sequence  <cit> . now, a high-density snp array platform facilitates high-throughput genotyping. multiple diversity panels containing hundreds of lines from diverse breeding programs have been densely genotyped with thousands of markers and can now be applied to genetic studies for which multiple sets of phenotypic data can be collected. here the availability of these genomics resources allowed us to map the physical position of the i gene. the region underlying the i gene contains a cluster of seven nbs-lrr r-genes, spanning ~ <dig>  kb region and confirms previous findings  <cit>  that suggested that this region was enriched for nbs-lrr-type sequences.

bsa, coupled with ngs genotyping pipelines, has been applied in other crops for development of markers linked to disease resistance genes  using contrasting  pools of ril populations. in several instances, specific ril populations segregate for only one or few genetic traits. in contrast, we applied in silico bsa to the beancap panel, containing  <dig> lines genotyped on an infinium 6k snp beadchip, which circumvented the need to develop a bi-parental mapping population. in addition, the use of the diversity panel allowed us to explore many more recombination events. most scar markers linked to disease resistance traits in common bean  were developed by bsa using rapd markers and ril populations, many of them derived from wide crosses  <cit> . consequently, several markers were of use only in specific populations, market classes, or gene pools   <cit> . the snps, and subsequent kasp and caps markers cosegregated with the i gene in the full beancap panel and a ril population .

although the sw <dig> marker is widely used in common bean breeding programs and seems to work across diverse material, recombination between the marker and i gene has been detected in distinct mapping populations, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm  <cit> . in fact, five resistant members of the diversity panel were assigned as susceptible and a single susceptible ril line was erroneously scored as resistant, based on the absence or presence of the dominant sw <dig> marker, respectively. the latter event is of greater consequence during breeding since a truly susceptible line might be advanced in the program even though it otherwise had the unwanted genotype . the new markers described here resolve those issues for breeders.

a blat search on the reference genome database revealed that the sw <dig> marker was distributed along several common bean chromosomes. the closest sequence hits  for partial sequences of sw <dig> marker on chromosome pv <dig> are approximately between  <dig> and  <dig> mbp away from the i gene. the position of the ss <dig> snp to the closest r-gene model  is ~ <dig> kb, which suggests the chance for recombination between the snp marker and the most proximal r-gene is very minimal.

we have demonstrated that bsa coupled with ngs technology can accurately identify snps linked to a disease resistance trait, which in turn enabled the development of robust marker systems. the approach to tag monogenic and quantitative traits of agronomic interest in common bean previously relied on the application of bsa using aflp, rapd, or ssr markers, but this task proved to be tedious and time consuming. the main advantage of ngs data is that sequence surrounding snps or any sequenced marker is readily available and can be assigned to a physical position on the reference genome; thus, their conversion to effective genetic markers is relatively straight forward.

we decided to target the closest candidate snp , that consistently cosegregated with i gene, for conversion to a cost-effective genetic kasp and caps markers. both genotyping technologies accurately predicted the disease response phenotype. in addition, these markers are codominant and thus are able to distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous resistant plants. thus, the implementation of either kasp or caps screening procedure can select homozygous resistant plants during early breeding cycles . this will save at least four months of progeny testing for this phenotype  <cit> .

bcmv is one of the most important viral diseases of common bean worldwide, and the combination of resistance genes with different mechanisms of action offers a more durable resistance compared to single gene resistance  <cit> . in addition, where necrotic strains of bcmv or bcmnv are present, plants with the i gene need to be protected from the strong, hypersensitive response by the addition of bc recessive genes  <cit> . one of the most desirable gene combinations is that of i + bc- <dig>  however, the action of the i gene is masked by bc- <dig>  and therefore direct selection for i gene is not possible  <cit> . thus, these new markers offer an opportunity for more efficient indirect selection of the i gene in the presence of bc recessive genes and greatly facilitates pyramiding the appropriate combination of genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first bsa approach that makes use of the wealth of information of gene/qtl mapping for disease resistance traits in common bean and exploits the snp variation underlying the chromosomal region associated with the i gene in a diversity panel. many disease resistance-markers previously developed for common bean are not ideal for mas . in this study, we were able to identify two distinct haplotypes each associated to resistance or susceptibility to bcmv across genetically diverse germplasm. since the physical position and sequences flanking the informative snps are known, the task for development of robust codominant marker systems is simplified. in addition, the availability of a densely phenotyped/genotyped diversity panel guarantees that developed markers are applicable to diverse germplasm, thus circumventing the need for developing specific bi-parental mapping populations.
