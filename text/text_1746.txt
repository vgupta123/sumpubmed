BACKGROUND
the mildew locus o  gene family encodes for plant-specific proteins structurally related to metazoan g-protein coupled receptors , harbouring seven transmembrane domains and a calmodulin-binding domain that is likely implicated in the perception of calcium-dependent stimuli  <cit> . genome-wide studies characterized a number of homologs varying from  <dig> to  <dig> in the mlo gene families of arabidopsis, grapevine, rice, peach, woodland strawberry and tobacco .

specific mlo homologs act as susceptibility factors towards fungi causing the powdery mildew  disease, affecting thousands of plant species and representing a major threat in many agricultural settings  <cit> . indeed, their inactivation, resulting from gene knock-out or knock-down, leads to a peculiar form of resistance, referred to as mlo resistance, based on the enhancement of pre-penetrative defence responses  <cit> . mlo resistance was first reported to occur in barley, following of loss-of-function mutations of the hvmlo gene  <cit> . more recently, knocking-out or knocking-down of specific mlo genes was shown to lead to pm resistance in several other plant species, namely arabidopsis, tomato, pea, pepper and wheat . pleiotropic effects associated with mlo resistance do not seem so severe to compromise its practical exploitation  <cit> . therefore, it has been suggested to selectively target mlo genes of cultivated species as a general breeding strategy against pm  <cit> . in contrast with other kind of immunities, such as those conferred by plant resistance genes , a body of evidence indicates that mlo resistance is characterized by broad-spectrum effectiveness and durability. for example, barley mlo resistance is effective against all known isolates of the pm fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, and is successfully employed in barley cultivars since  <dig>  <cit> . similarly, pea er <dig> pm resistance, due to loss of function mutations of the psmlo <dig> gene, was first reported in  <dig> and is the only resistance source worldwide used for breeding purposes  <cit> .

previous phylogenetic studies grouped mlo proteins in six clades  <cit> . available scientific literature indicates that the clades referred to as iv and v, displaying peculiar molecular features, include a few homologs playing a major role in pm susceptibility in monocots and dicots, respectively  <cit> . moreover, corresponding mlo genes are strongly upregulated upon challenge with pm fungi , watermelon  and zucchini  are three important horticultural cucurbitaceae species, grown throughout the world and of great interest for nutritional properties as well as for economic importance. recently, genome sequence of these three species was released  <cit> , . several putative disease resistance genes were identified in the melon genome. among them,  <dig> genes were classified as transmembrane receptors and found to be homologous to barley hvmlo  <cit> . no member of the watermelon and zucchini mlo gene families was isolated so far.

here, we used melon, watermelon and zucchini genomic resources to characterize the corresponding mlo gene families, and gain information with respect to their structure, evolutionary history and function. among other things, this could result extremely useful for practical breeding activities aiming to select pm resistant cultivars in these species.

RESULTS
characterization of the mlo gene family in c. melo, c. lanatus and c. pepo
in order to identify mlo proteins in melon, a blastp analysis against the publicly available genomic database of c.melo was performed. this yielded  <dig> significant matches, each corresponding to a mlo-like hit. two of the newly identified cmmlo proteins  resulted to be identical to different regions of the melon homolog cmmlo <dig>  previously characterized  <cit> . we decided to discard these sequences and keep the corresponding cmmlo <dig> gene for further analysis since its sequence and expression was experimentally validated by cheng et al.  <cit> . cmmlo genes corresponding to the newly identified proteins were named from cmmlo <dig> to cmmlo <dig> .table  <dig> features of the c. melo mlo gene family

information reported in the table was extracted by the genbank genomic database  and the melonomics genomic database 



database search revealed the occurrence of additional splicing variants for the c. melo homologs cmmlo <dig>  cmmlo <dig> and cmmlo <dig> . with the exception of cmmlo <dig>  chromosomal localizations of cmmlo genes were inferred based on the presence, on the same scaffold, of single nucleotide polymorphism  markers mapped to melon linkage groups  <cit>  . predicted intron/exon structure and corresponding protein amino acid length were also obtained by database search .

a similar in silico approach allowed the identification of members of the mlo protein family in c. lanatus. blastp of melon mlo protein sequences against the cucurbit genomics database resulted in the identification of  <dig> significant matches annotated as mlo-like proteins. corresponding genes were named from clmlo <dig> to clmlo <dig>  for all of them, it was possible to determine chromosomal localization and intron/exon boundaries .table  <dig> features of the c. lanatus mlo gene family

phylogenetic analysis
the mlo-pfam domain of c. melo, c. lanatus and c. pepo mlo proteins was used to infer phylogenetic distances between them and with respect to mlo homologs of other plant species . in total,  <dig> mlo proteins  collapsed in six phylogenetic clades  . these were designated with the roman numerals from i to vi, based on the position of arabidopsis and monocot mlo homologs, according to the previous study of  <cit> .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of cucurbitaceae mlo proteins. the tree, obtained by the whelan and goldman model, includes  <dig> cucurbitaceae homologs harbouring at least 50 % of the mlo-pfam domain and  <dig> reference mlo proteins already characterized in other species. clades were numerated with the roman numerals from i to vi, according to devoto et al.  <dig>  <cit>  and based on the position of arabidopsis and monocot mlo homologs. the tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths proportional to the number of substitutions per site. bootstrap values higher than  <dig> , are indicated above the branches. green boxes highlight seven putative orthologous groups  of cucurbitaceae mlo proteins with a bootstrap support ≥  <dig>  positioned in four  phylogenetic clades; red boxes indicate five orthologous pairs  with bootstrap support ≥ 99



strong bootstrap support was found for the presence of a common ancestor in the evolutionary history of clades i and ii . clade i includes  <dig> mlo proteins, three of which are annotated in arabidopsis , four in c. melo , four in c. lanatus  and one in c. pepo . clade ii groups eight mlo homologs, annotated in arabidopsis , c. melo , c. lanatus  and c. pepo .

phylogenetic data also provided evidence for a common ancestor originating clades iii and iv . clade iii includes nine cucurbitaceae homologs  together with five arabidopsis proteins . clade iv contains mlo proteins from monocot species only.

three melon , four zucchini  and five watermelon proteins  cluster together in the phylogenetic clade v, including all the dicot mlo homologs experimentally shown to act as pm susceptibility factors . finally, clade vi is located on an ancestral position, lacking c. melo homologs and harbouring only three proteins .

a further phylogenetic analysis was performed using nucleotide sequences  of the c. melo, c. lanatus and c. pepo gene families . this did not provide clear evidence of recent gene duplication events, as the rate of nucleotide identity of monophyletic mlo pairs resulted to be very low. for each of the three species, the highest levels of pairwise nucleotide identity concern the pairs cmmlo4-cmmlo <dig> , clmlo9-clmlo <dig>  and cpmlo3-cpmlo <dig>  .

orthology between cucurbitaceae mlo families
phylogenetic analysis supported the identification of five putative ortholog pairs  and seven putative ortholog groups  including c. melo, c. lanatus and c. pepo mlo homologs . the putative ortholog groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> included three c. pepo paralog pairs, cpmlo3-cpmlo <dig>  cpmlo11-cpmlo <dig> and cpmlo10-cpmlo <dig>  respectively . in order to provide further evidence for the identification of cucurbitaceae orthologs, we performed multiple genome alignments of c. melo, c. lanatus and c. pepo genomic regions harbouring mlo genes. we reasoned that, in case of orthology, these regions, sharing a common ancestry, would have displayed high level of syntheny. remarkably, all the mlo homologs clustering in the same ortholog group or pair were found to be located in syntenic genomic regions , thus substantiating the predictions resulting from the phylogenetic study.fig.  <dig> identification of putative cucurbitaceae mlo orthologs in synthenic genomic regions. c. lanatus, c. melo and c. pepo mlo loci are indicated with solid green boxes. collinear blocks are labelled with the same colour and connected by lines. block boundaries indicate breakpoints of genome rearrangements. panel a) refers to the triads clmlo <dig>  cmmlo <dig>  cpmlo <dig> and clmlo <dig>  clmlo <dig> and cpmlo12; panel b) refers to the triads clmlo <dig>  cpmlo <dig>  cmmlo <dig> and clmlo <dig>  cpmlo <dig>  cmmlo6




characterization of conserved amino acids and motifs
to examine sequence features of melon, watermelon and zucchini mlo proteins, a full-length multiple sequence alignment of  <dig> cucurbitaceae proteins was performed. for comparative purposes, we completed the dataset with  <dig> mlo proteins from  <dig> different plant species , known to play a major role in the interaction with pm fungi. aligned regions of the cucurbitaceae mlo homologs showed very high conservation levels  with respect to the  <dig> amino acid residues previously indicated as invariable throughout the whole mlo protein family  <cit>  . moreover, we found other  <dig> residues highly conserved  in the cucurbitaceae mlo families as well as in the other mlo homologs used for multiple alignment. these are distributed in the extracellular n-terminal region , the 1st intracellular loop , the 2nd transmembrane domain , the 1st extracellular loop , the 2nd intracellular loop  and the 3rd intracellular loop  .

analysis of mlo proteins belonging to clade v revealed the presence of  <dig> conserved  residues in common between cucurbitaceae and other species , thus indicating they could specifically play a role in the response to pm fungi. moreover,  <dig> patterns of consecutive conserved amino acids , distributed along all the known domains of mlo proteins and ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> residues, were identified .

selection pressure acting on cucurbitaceae mlo gene families
the dissimilarity level between the non-synonymous substitution  and synonymous substitution  values was used to infer the direction and magnitude of natural selection acting on mlo genes in c. melo, c. lanatus and c. pepo. neutrality tests, performed on the mlo gene family of each of the three cucurbitaceae species, yielded average δ  and ω  values ranging from − <dig>  to − <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively . this indicates that negative selection has been acting against extreme polymorphic variants. in particular, the mlo families of c. lanatus and c. melo, whose members have average sequences identity of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, appear to be subjected to very high negative selection pressures . the c. pepo mlo family, including members with average identity of  <dig>  %, is characterized by a softer level of negative selection . single codon analysis highlighted the presence of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> negatively selected sites in the c. pepo, c. lanatus and c. melo mlo families, respectively. with respect to other phylogenetic clades, clade v displays lower δ  and ω  values , thus suggesting that it is subjected to a larger number of selective constraints.table  <dig> average nucleotide diversity  and non synonymous to synonymous substitutions mean dissimilarity analysis




all the values of δ  and ω  reported in the table, estimated from different alignments of mlo coding sequences, were calculated using the nei-gojobori and slac methods, respectively, and are significant  over the null hypothesis of strict-neutrality  in favour of the alternative hypotheses of positive  or negative  selections



interestingly, single codon evolutionary analysis of clade v homologs also revealed the presence of three protein regions, located in the 1st transmembrane domain, the 1st extracellular loop and the intracellular c-terminus domain, harbouring several residues predicted to be under positive selection pressure. despite the low number of sequences used for the analysis, one of them  is characterized by a p-value < <dig>   evolutionary analysis) . in order to validate this finding, we analysed the direction and magnitude of natural selection acting on the rosaceae clade v mlo homologs reported by  <cit> . notably, this resulted in the identification of several codons characterized by high dn-ds values and encoding for residues also positioned in the protein 1st transmembrane domain, 1st extracellular loop and intracellular c-terminus .fig.  <dig> direction and magnitude of natural selection acting on cucurbitaceae clade v mlo homologs. a) codon-based dn-ds values and sequence logo indicating nucleotide conservation along the alignment of cucurbitaceae clade v mlo coding sequences. blue and red dots indicate positive and negative values, respectively. green circles indicate protein regions containing codons predicted to be subjected to positive selection, and the star indicates a codon characterized by a significant p-value  for positive selection . aligned sequences are also indicated, together with gene regions predicted to encode for extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular protein regions . b) close-up view on the gene region containing the codon in position  <dig> of the alignment

c. lanatus cmmlo <dig> is upregulated upon pm challenge
a distinctive feature of mlo susceptibility genes is their up-regulation upon pm challenge. therefore, we quantified relative expression levels of clade v watermelon mlo genes  in leaves artificially inoculated with the pm fungus podosphaera xanthii and in non-inoculated controls. no significant difference was detected for clmlo <dig>  clmlo <dig>  clmlo <dig> and clmlo <dig>  notably, strong up-regulations was observed for clmlo <dig> at the time points corresponding to  <dig> and 24 h after inoculation, indicating that it is a pathogen-responsive gene .fig.  <dig> transcriptional variation of c. lanatus clade v mlo genes in response to pm challenge. data refer to leaves of the watermelon cultivar ‘sugar baby’, sampled at three different time points  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h post inoculation  with the pm fungus podosphaera xanthii. for each time point, relative expression levels are normalized with respect to the housekeeping gene β-actin and compared to non-inoculated controls. standard error bars refer to a number of biological replicates ranging from three to four. significant differences between the means were inferred using the student’s t test for each time point 



discussion
in this study, we exploited available genomic resources to characterize the mlo gene family in cultivated cucurbitaceae. a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mlo-like gene sequences were identified in the genomes of c. melo, c. lanatus and c. pepo, respectively. this is consistent with the results of previous genome-wide surveys, reporting the presence of a number of mlo homologs variable from  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . all the predicted c. lanatus mlo proteins resulted to have amino acid lengths comparable to those of arabidopsis atmlo homologs, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> residues  <cit> . in contrast, predicted length of some of the c. melo and c. pepo mlo homologs resulted be markedly shorter or, in one case, longer than these limits , possibly due to incorrect prediction.

information on chromosome/scaffold localization of c. melo and c. lanatus mlo homologs revealed that most of them occur as singletons, thus indicating they have been mainly originated by segmental duplication events. this is consistent with previous investigations on the evolution of the mlo gene family in rosaceae species and in soybean  <cit> . nonetheless, for each of the two species, three pairs of physically close homologs were found  , which are likely the result of tandem duplication. none of the duplication event in the c. pepo, c. lanatus and c. melo genomes appeared to have occurred recently, as resulting from the computational analysis performed in this work indicating a low rate of nucleotide identity between monophyletic mlo pairs .

relations of orthology between cucurbitaceae mlo homologs were inferred based on both phylogenetic relatedness and localization in microsynthenic regions. this resulted in the prediction of five ortholog pairs and seven ortholog groups . importantly, in support of our conclusions, all the c. lanatus/c. melo ortholog pairs predicted in this study are positioned in macrosynthenic genomic regions between the two species, described by guo et al.  <cit>  . in three cases, ortholog groups were found to contain  <dig> homologs from c. pepo . possibly, these might represent co-orthologs relative to c. melo and c. lanatus proteins falling in the same group, which originated from duplication during the evolutionary history of c. pepo genome.

phylogenetic analysis allowed to assign cucurbitaceae mlo proteins to the five evolutionary clades previously reported to include homologs from dicotyledonous species . three melon, three watermelon and four zucchini mlo homologs were found to cluster together in the phylogenetic clade v, containing all the dicot isoforms functionally associated with pm susceptibility. moreover, we demonstrated that watermelon clmlo <dig> is up-regulated during pathogenesis, a feature which is shared by other pm susceptibility factors . thus, with our study we provide information on targets of future activities addressed to the inactivation of pm susceptibility genes and, thus, the selection of resistant genotypes. several approaches of reverse genetics are available to breeders interested in mlo gene knock-out or knock down, such as those based on rna interference , targeted induced local lesions in genomes , transcription activator-like effector nucleases , zinc finger nucleases  and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat  technology . noteworthy, talen and crispr technology have been recently successfully used to introduce mlo resistance in bread wheat, as reported by wang et al.  <cit> .

we performed a multiple alignment of a large dataset mlo proteins, aiming to detect amino acid residues and motifs that, being highly conserved, are predicted to play a major role for protein function. as expected, a very high conservation level was found with respect to the  <dig> amino acids previously shown to be invariable in a panel of  <dig> selected mlo sequences  <cit> . in addition, we detected other  <dig> highly conserved residues . alignment, restricted to isoforms known to act as pm susceptibility factors and clade v cucurbitaceae mlo homologs, also revealed a series of conserved amino acid residues and motifs scattered in several protein domains . these might be specifically important for the function of isoforms associated with pm susceptibility. with this respect, our study complements the previous work of panstruga  <cit> , reporting the identification, in the mlo protein first extracellular region, second and third intracellular regions and the cytoplasmic c-terminus, of a series of amino acids specifically conserved in putative orthologs of barley hvmlo.

in line with the identification of several conserved residues, tests addressed to infer evolutionary forces acting on cucurbitaceae mlo homologs suggested a general high level of negative selection , thus pointing to the presence of a series of constraints required for protein function. interestingly, single codon analysis of clade v cucurbitaceae and rosaceae mlo homologs also highlighted the occurrence of three protein regions that are likely under positive selection pressure . positive selection is a common phenomenon which drives plant/pathogen co-evolution, in accordance to an “arms race” model  <cit> . for example, positive selection been shown to occur for solvent-exposed residues of plant resistance  genes, as it provides an advantage in pathogen recognition  <cit> . it might be tempting to speculate that positively selected mlo residues located in the first extracellular loop or in the intracellular c-terminus might also be implicated in pathogen sensing. however, the role of mlo proteins in the interaction with pm fungi is still elusive to date, and no molecular interaction between mlo proteins and pathogen effectors has been reported so far.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we carried out a genome-wide characterization of the mlo gene families in three economically important cucurbitaceae species. importantly, our results also lay a foundation for future breeding activities aimed at introducing pm resistance.
