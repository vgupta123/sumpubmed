BACKGROUND
chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium and member of the chlamydiaceae, a family of pathogens of higher eukaryotes with a distinct biphasic development cycle  <cit> . whilst c. pneumoniae is primarily recognised as an aetiological agent of community acquired pneumonia and other respiratory diseases in humans  <cit> , it has a broad host range encompassing both warm  and cold blooded animals  <cit> . members of the chlamydiaceae are characterised by their compact genomes and highly conserved gene content  <cit> . c. pneumoniae has the greatest coding capacity of the chlamydiaceae, with animal strains of c. pneumoniae having between 20kbp  to almost 200kbp   <cit>  of extra nucleotide sequence. the additional coding capacity of c. pneumoniae is predominantly accounted for by the expansion of the polymorphic membrane protein  and inclusion membrane protein  gene families , both of which are involved in the formation and maintenance of the chlamydial inclusion body, modulation of the host cell response  <cit> , as well as a large number of species-specific metabolic and hypothetical protein genes  <cit> .

in addition to its description as a cause of human respiratory disease, c. pneumoniae has been implicated in a variety of human pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, alzheimer’s disease, ischaemic stroke, asthma and lung cancer . until recently, the majority of fully sequenced c. pneumoniae whole genomes were from strains that were isolated from respiratory pathologies  <cit> , and demonstrated highly conserved nucleotide sequence content and gene order. recently, several genomes from respiratory and cardiovascular strains were reported, as were whole genome sequences from atherosclerotic and alzheimer’s c. pneumoniae strains, which allowed for comparison of strains isolated from different diseases, and demonstrated that only minor genetic differences were found between these strains  <cit> .

a previous study examining the genetic diversity between human and animal c. pneumoniae suggested that a genetically distinct strain of human c. pneumoniae was present and circulating within australian indigenous communities  <cit> . pcr analysis of a small number of selected target genes was performed on two respiratory strains isolated from indigenous australian patients in geographically separate regions  <cit>  and these were shown to have nucleotide sequence, that in some instances, placed these strains phylogenetically closer to animal strains of c. pneumoniae than those circulating in human populations in australia and worldwide  <cit> .

to further explore the genetic diversity of australian human c. pneumoniae strains, we genome sequenced and performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses of two human australian indigenous c. pneumoniae strains and a third strain from an australian caucasian patient. in doing so, we  demonstrate that the indigenous australian human strains form a separate clade branching earlier than other human c. pneumoniae strains;  identify genetic markers unique to australian indigenous and non-indigenous strains; and  reveal evidence of limited recombination within c. pneumoniae strains from the greater human c. pneumoniae clade.

RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships in human c. pneumoniae reveal a distinct australian indigenous clade predating european exploration of the continent
c. pneumoniae strains sh <dig>   <dig>  <cit>  and wa <dig>  <cit>  were sequenced following capture of c. pneumoniae dna using a set of species-specific sureselectxt rna probes . sequencing reads of c. pneumoniae wa <dig>  sh <dig> and  <dig> were mapped to the reference genome, c. pneumoniae ar <dig>  to check the efficacy of the sureselectxt dna captures. the genome of sh <dig> had the highest mean read depth of 1944×, followed by  <dig>  which had an average read depth of 1887×. the sh <dig> and  <dig> assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> contigs, respectively. in contrast, c. pneumoniae wa <dig> genome had a significantly lower read depth of 15× and assembled into  <dig> contigs.

in order to determine the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships between the australian c. pneumoniae strains and those previously published, bayesian and coalescent estimation methods were used to construct phylogenetic trees based on whole genome alignments of all human c. pneumoniae strains and the three published animal c. pneumoniae strains.

percentage pairwise identities between indigenous and non-indigenous strains ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %, whilst non-indigenous strains were  <dig>  % or greater. percentage identities of all strains used in the mrbayes analysis are outlined in table  <dig>  the resulting phylogenetic tree as represented in fig.  <dig>  demonstrates a clear demarcation of animal and human clades. the majority of non-indigenous human strains cluster into two clades: a large single clade that contains the ar <dig> and cwl <dig> subclades, and the smaller tw <dig> clade  <cit> . interestingly, the two australian indigenous c. pneumoniae strains, sh <dig> and  <dig>  formed their own clade which branched deepest from the main human c. pneumoniae grouping, but was also considerably distant to the animal c. pneumoniae clade. the australian caucasian strain wa <dig> and iol <dig>   <cit>  formed their own separate branches in the main human c. pneumoniae clade.table  <dig> percentage nucleotide pairwise identities of all c. pneumoniae strains

to investigate the evolutionary relationships of these deep-branching australian indigenous human strains further, we determined the date of the most recent common ancestor  of the indigenous australian c. pneumoniae strains by using beast  <cit>  and clonalframe  <cit>  coalescent estimation methods. beast analysis of indigenous and non-indigenous c. pneumoniae strains reveals an mrca for indigenous strains at  <dig>  with a 95 % credibility interval between  <dig> and 1062 years. the mean substitution rate was determined to be  <dig>  × 10− <dig> substitutions per site, per year. clonalframe analysis of indigenous and non-indigenous c. pneumoniae strains reveals a mrca of  <dig> for the indigenous strains, with a mean substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> per site per year. though there are minor differences in the predicted mrca and substitution rates between the two programs, which can be accounted for by the difference in their calculation methods  <cit> , their estimates support similar evolutionary timelines and dates.

identification of genetic markers that distinguish australian indigenous strains from non-indigenous and animal c. pneumoniae strains
using a pcr-based sequencing approach, we previously identified a series of potential genetic markers that could be used to distinguish caucasian c. pneumoniae strains of different origins  <cit> . in the current study, fine-detailed genomic comparisons identified a series of novel genetic markers unique to the australian indigenous strains, as well as unexpected sequence diversity in the dc <dig>  wa <dig> and iol <dig> strains, which support their distinct phylogenetic positions in the c. pneumoniae tree.

one of the most significant regions of genetic variation identified is located around four full-length inca genes annotated in koala strain lpcoln ; the differences of which support our phylogenetic results. the most notable finding in this region for the three australian strains was the observation that the australian indigenous strains contain a full-length homolog of cpk_orf <dig> sharing  <dig>  % nucleotide pairwise identity to the koala homolog . the presence of this gene in strains sh <dig> and  <dig>  and its significant sequence identity to the koala/bandicoot homolog supports the branching of the australian indigenous clade earliest in the greater human c. pneumoniae phylogeny. conversely, the australian indigenous strains do not have a copy of cpk_orf <dig>  this locus is also absent in the frog  strain and all strains within the tw <dig> clade, but is found in fragmented forms in all other human strains. gene copy numbers and fragmentation with respect to the koala lpcoln strain is represented in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> the inca gene expansion and recombination locus spanning homologs of cpk_orf <dig> through  <dig> . human and frog c. pneumoniae strains encode for either two or three copies with various levels of fragmentation between strains. different clades within human c. pneumoniae encode for identical sequence length across this locus. the australian indigenous strains are the only known human c. pneumoniae strains to encode for a cpk_orf <dig> homolog



another genetic marker unique to the australian indigenous c. pneumoniae strains sh <dig> and  <dig>  was the presence of a 159 bp insertion in the gene homologous to koala cpk_orf <dig> . translation of the open reading frame suggests that this is a putative inca gene which is full length in the koala strain. however, this gene is slightly truncated by  <dig> amino acids in indigenous strains  and is only  <dig> amino acids in length in all other strains, including frog dc <dig> - due to a single nucleotide insertion 3’ which results in a frame shift . again, the large, strain-specific insertion and its sequence similarity to the koala homolog, supports the earliest branching of the australian indigenous strains in the major human c. pneumoniae clade.fig.  <dig> a large sequence insertion is specific to indigenous strains sh <dig> and  <dig>  within a putative inca gene homologous to cpk_orf <dig>  this insertion encodes an almost full-length inca homolog similar to that in the koala and bandicoot strains. sequences at this locus for sh <dig> and  <dig> are identical, and are shown compared to human strain ar <dig> and koala strain lpcoln



sequence polymorphism has been described in the guab/a-add operon in human and animal c. pneumoniae strains, with previous studies detailing that human c. pneumoniae strains encode fragmented inosine-5-monophosphate dehydrogenase  genes  <cit> . in this study, we found that like the dc <dig> frog strain, the australian indigenous strains and strain iol <dig> encode for a full length, intact guab gene. by comparison, all other human strains have a t/c transition at nucleotide position  <dig>  which results in a stop codon . varied levels of sequence decay are evident in the australian strains for gmp synthase  and adenosine deaminase . deletions in both the guaa and add homologs of wa <dig> result in truncations of these genes with loss of functional domains, whilst the australian indigenous strains exhibit extensive sequence decay at this locus, resulting in the absence of guaa-add and the downstream hypothetical protein. interestingly, whilst the entire guaa/b-add operon is absent in both koala and bandicoot strains, these genes are present in the frog strain dc <dig> fig.  <dig> a single nucleotide transition in strains sh <dig>   <dig>  dc <dig> and iol <dig> results in a full-length guab gene, compared to fragmented genes in other human c. pneumoniae represented by ar <dig>  the amino acid residue change at position  <dig> in strains iol <dig>   <dig>  sh <dig> and dc <dig> is highlighted in the pink box, whilst the black arrow below the ar <dig> sequence indicates the guab stop codon which is present in all other human c. pneumoniae strains. the iol <dig> homolog is n-terminal truncated by  <dig> amino acids



various sequence polymorphisms are evident in the australian c. pneumoniae strains for the pmpe/f <dig> gene. both indigenous australian strains  <dig> and sh <dig> are truncated as the result of several deletions, whilst a single nucleotide insertion in wa <dig> results in a frameshift causing truncation of this gene. this results in the loss of the c-terminal autotransporter domain for all three strains - however the mid-gene region encoding for nine fxxn and eight gga amino acid motifs are highly conserved across all the human c. pneumoniae strains . additionally, whilst both the koala and bandicoot homologs of this gene display extensive sequence polymorphism, the dc <dig> frog homolog is highly similar in sequence to the non-indigenous human pmpe/f <dig> and encodes for the full-length protein.fig.  <dig> 
pmpe/f <dig> displays significant sequence polymorphism and decay in australian c. pneumoniae strains sh <dig>   <dig> and wa <dig>  resulting in truncated homologs of this protein. the frog dc <dig> homolog is similar in sequence to human c. pnuemoniae strains, unlike the koala and bandicoot strains which are highly polymorphic at this locus. the gga - fxxn amino acid repeat motifs characteristic to the polymorphic membrane protein gene family are highlighted, whilst sequence for the c-terminal autotransporter domain is clearly absent in sh <dig>   <dig>  wa <dig> and lpcoln strains



australian indigenous strains demonstrate characteristic recombination profiles with only a few instances shared with non-indigenous strains
in addition to estimation of the mrca and mean substitution rate, clonalframe was used to determine the recombination profiles and any shared recombination loci in c. pneumoniae. our study found that the australian indigenous strains sh <dig> and  <dig> had a distinct and almost identical recombination and nucleotide substitution profile, with only a single difference in recombination locus between the two: sh <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp and  <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp. additionally, sh <dig> and  <dig> share a strongly supported recombination event with the atherosclerosis strain a <dig> and to a lesser extent with australian non-indigenous strain wa <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig> , which encompasses hypothetical protein and putative inca genes. in comparing recombination profiles across the non-indigenous c. pneumoniae strains, the australian wa <dig> strain shares a single strong recombination event with a <dig> and tw <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, which encompasses putative inca genes. several nucleotide substitution events are shared amongst the various c. pneumoniae strains, though the highest number of nucleotide substitutions occur in strains j <dig>  iol <dig> and dc <dig> . a phi test for recombination was performed on the c. pneumoniae whole genome alignment using splitstree <dig>  <cit> , which found a total of  <dig>  informative sites and statistically significant evidence of recombination .fig.  <dig> whole genome recombination mappings as predicted by clonalframe coalescent methods. red bars represent recombination events and green ticks represent mutations. strains sh <dig> and  <dig> share almost identical recombination profiles, with non-indigenous human c. pneumoniae and the dc <dig> frog strain sharing recombination events at discrete loci. the predicted whole genome phylogeny based on recombination and mutation events is consistent with the groupings demonstrated using beast and mrbayes prediction methods



discussion
c. pneumoniae has been described as an ancient pathogen, with the broadest host range of any member of the chlamydiaceae  <cit> . comparative whole genome studies examining the differences between human respiratory  <cit> , non-respiratory  <cit>  and animal c. pneumoniae strains  <cit>  all demonstrate a highly conserved core genome with subtle strain-specific differences. we previously characterized some of these subtle differences using a pcr/sequencing approach and revealed that the two human australian indigenous human strains sequenced in this study shared genetic markers with the koala lpcoln strain  <cit>  for some genes and away from other human non-australian indigenous strains  <cit> . to further explore the relationship of australian indigenous and non-indigenous human strains, in the current study, we obtained whole genome sequences for three australian respiratory strains  and performed comparative analyses to further understand their relationship to other previously characterized human and animal c. pneumoniae strains.

using a variety of phylogenomic tools, our analysis suggests that the australian c. pneumoniae indigenous strains form a phylogenetically distinct clade away from all other human c. pneumoniae strains sequenced to date. this is substantiated by unique sequence polymorphisms and recombination profiles associated with the australian indigenous strains. in contrast to previous phylogenies constructed using sequenced pcr fragments, which alternately placed the australian indigenous strains within either the human or animal branches of the tree  <cit> , the use of whole genome sequences gives a more accurate description of the position of these strains within the greater c. pneumoniae evolutionary tree. fine-detailed genomic comparisons also revealed several novel genetic markers in australian indigenous human c. pneumoniae strains, beyond those previously identified in previous pcr-based studies  <cit> .

the australian indigenous strains demonstrate a copy number incongruity within the cpk_orf <dig> to cpk_orf <dig> inca gene family. this gene family expansion was first described in the koala lpcoln strain  <cit>  with human c. pneumoniae strains exhibiting variable levels of gene fragmentation and gene loss at this locus. the australian indigenous strains are unique in that they specifically encode a homolog to cpk_orf00549: to date, sh <dig> and  <dig> are the only human c. pnuemoniae strains that encode for this homolog. previous studies have shown that c. pneumoniae encodes a far larger number of inca and putative inca proteins compared to other chlamydiae  <cit> , many of which are species-specific. strong recombination signals were also detected within several human c. pneumoniae strains at loci encoding inca proteins, which suggests that recombination may account for the expanded number of inca proteins in c. pneumoniae.

one of the more subtle genetic differences observed between the strains analysed was the maintenance of a partial purine biosynthesis pathway encoded by guaa/b-add  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that the guab gene is fragmented in human c. pneumoniae strains  <cit> , however in this study we demonstrate that strains dc <dig>  sh <dig> and  <dig> encode for an intact guab gene. given that the australian indigenous strains do not encode guaa-add, it is likely that the sequence for guab was a recent acquisition from a strain most similar to dc <dig>  interestingly, in contrast to the koala and bandicoot strains where the entire guaa/b-add operon is absent  <cit> , the frog dc <dig> strain encodes guaa/b-add genes, with > <dig>  % nucleotide pairwise identity to all human c. pneumoniae strains, with the exception of the three australian strains. studies in both c. psittaci and chlamydia caviae have found evidence for horizontal gene transfer of the guaa/b-add operon between different chlamydial strains and species  <cit> , lending further support for the recent acquisition of guab by the australian indigenous strains. whilst it is unclear what effect the presence or absence of guaa/b-add has on the growth and virulence of human and animal c. pneumoniae strains, a previous study examining the effect of mutations in the chlamydia muridarum plasticity zone suggest that 5’ point mutations of guab and add result in attenuated virulence in vivo, whilst guaa/b-add mutations do not affect the growth characteristics of these strains in vitro  <cit> . these observations are similar to those reported for the growth and virulence of borrelia burgdorferi and francisella tularensis guaa/b +/− strains in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

in order to further explore the evolutionary relationships of the australian indigenous c. pneumoniae strains, beast and clonalframe analyses predicted that these strains had an mrca of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. both of these estimations pre-date the known colonization of the australian continent by europeans by several hundred years, but are virtually identical to the previously estimated mrca for strains within the non-indigenous clade at  <dig> +/− 20 years  <cit> .

given this new evidence and our previous data suggesting that c. pneumoniae strains in humans likely originated from a zoonotic event  <cit> , it is interesting to speculate on the origin of these indigenous human c. pneumoniae strains. two possible evolutionary hypotheses to explain the deep-branching of these strains are proposed: , the australian indigenous strains have evolved from a separate zoonotic transmission event, or alternate intermediate strain, to that of the other human c. pneumoniae strains. these ancestral strains were subsequently endemic on the australian continent and continued to evolve in isolation to the non-indigenous c. pneumoniae strains. alternatively , all human c. pneumoniae strains disseminated from a common intermediate strain, resultant from a single zoonotic event several thousand years ago, and evolved separately in response to their different ecological niches . our findings provide support for both hypotheses.fig.  <dig> evolutionary hypothesis model describing two alternate hypotheses for the characteristic deep-branching of the australian indigenous strains sh <dig> and  <dig>  in hypothesis a, australian indigenous strains evolved from a separate zoonotic  transmission event, and continued to evolve in isolation from non-indigenous human c. pneumoniae strains. in hypothesis b, all human c. pneumoniae strains disseminated from a single zoonotic  transmission event and evolved separately in response to differing ecological functions



with respect to hypothesis , estimations from both beast and clonalframe analyses indicate an mrca for the indigenous strains several hundred years prior to the first reported visitation of the australian continent by dutch or british explorers  <cit> . this suggests the possibility that an endemic strain similar to our strains may have been circulating within the indigenous population prior to the arrival of european colonisation. given the sequence similarity of the indigenous strains to the koala and bandicoot c. pneumoniae strains at several key loci , as well as those previously described  <cit> , it is possible that a strain similar to these animal strains was zoonotically transmitted to humans on the australian continent. hunter-gatherer communities lived in close proximity and interacted with wild animals throughout human history, which would facilitate the transmission of a pathogen to humans. serological studies examining the prevalence of chlamydial infection in remote indigenous communities have reported levels of almost 60 % adult female seroprevalence to c. pneumoniae  <cit> . several species of native australian marsupials  <cit>  as well as an amphibian  <cit>  have been demonstrated to have genetic sequence similar to that of the koala lpcoln strain. studies have shown that koala and bandicoot c. pneumoniae strains readily infect various human-derived cell lines  <cit> , and evidence for human carotid artery and pbmc strains which are genotypically similar to the koala strain at the ompa and yge-urk intergenic spacer loci have been reported  <cit> . if the distinct phylogenetic clustering of sh <dig> and  <dig> is a result of a separate zoonotic event to that of the main human c. pneumoniae lineage, then it is likely that the animal strain that they have evolved from is still unknown, and probably more similar to the frog dc <dig> strain in sequence and nucleotide content.

the alternate hypothesis , is that all human c. pneumoniae strains disseminated from a single zoonotic event  and then differentiated along separate evolutionary paths, dependent on their geographical and disease niche. the estimated mrca for indigenous and non-indigenous human strains differs by less than 200 years, whilst their phylogenetic distance is significantly closer, compared to the animal strains. the overall nucleotide pairwise identity of the australian indigenous strains is more similar to other human strains of c. pneumoniae, even when significant similarities to animal strains at discrete loci are included. there are two possible mechanisms to explain the dissemination of these particular strains: firstly - various strains of c. pneumoniae were circulating in the worldwide human population approximately  <dig> thousand years ago, which is well prior to the colonisation of the australian continent  <cit> , and that one or some of these strains came to the continent with the arrival of the indigenous peoples. this would account for the characteristic sequence polymorphisms present in the sh <dig> and  <dig> but not in other human c. pneumoniae strains. alternately - the worldwide variation in human c. pneumoniae is far greater than has yet been determined, and several strain types were introduced to the australian continent with european colonisation. this in turn accounts for the overall sequence similarity of the sh <dig> and  <dig> strains to non-indigenous human c. pneumoniae strains, in particular wa <dig>  with which it shares a considerable number of snps, as opposed to the australian marsupial strains, lpcoln and b <dig>  in both cases, genetically distinct subpopulations of c. pneumoniae could have spread throughout, and evolved in isolation within the indigenous australian population. genotypic variation amongst concurrent populations of monomorphic bacteria resulting from selective sweeps is well documented in both chlamydia  <cit>  and other bacterial species  <cit> . the differentiation of the main human c. pneumoniae lineage from both the indigenous and animal lineages could be explained by adaptation of these strains to selective and antigenic pressure as a result of extensive antibiotic treatment regimes  <cit> .

whilst our study provides evidence for a phylogenetically and genetically distinct branch of human c. pneumoniae, these inferences are made on a relatively small sample size, taken from two individuals from remote communities in the same state, over two decades ago. it is highly unlikely that sampling from the same remote communities and wider ranging communities will uncover the same strains as documented in this study; given the increased interaction between members of remote indigenous communities and neighbouring townships, as well as expanded antibiotic treatment regimes for a range of bacterial infections, including chlamydia, within these communities. it is also possible that greater sampling for c. pneumoniae in countries outside australia would uncover a wider range of strains, some of which may be similar to those described in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we used a combination of comparative genomic and phylogenetic methods to determine the evolutionary position of three australian human c. pneumoniae strains within the greater c. pneumoniae tree. our study demonstrated a phylogenetically distinct human c. pneumoniae clade consisting of two australian indigenous strains, that branched earlier in the human c. pneumoniae evolutionary tree with an estimated mrca predating the exploration and colonisation of the continent by european settlers by several hundred years. our findings indicate that a unique strain of c. pneumoniae evolved in isolation within the australian indigenous population, as evidenced by the unique recombination profiles and distinct sequence polymorphisms in these strains. this suggests that a far greater level of sequence diversity is present amongst human and animal c. pneumoniae strains than previously surmised, and that further sampling of c. pneumoniae isolates from wider geographical regions may uncover strains which have evolved similarly to this unique c. pneumoniae clade.
