BACKGROUND
we have previously generated a stable neuroepithelial  cell line derived from human embryonic stem  cells  that is grown under adherent conditions, is self-renewing, and stably maintains capacity for neuronal or glial differentiation. these hes-nep cells recapitulate morphological and phenotypic features of neural progenitor cells isolated from fetal tissue  <cit> . such a cell line has potential both as a source for specific neuronal lineages to be used in hes cell neural therapy and as an in vitro model system in which to study human nep cell function and its regulation by signaling mediators such as lysophospholipids. the lysophospholipid signaling mediators lysophosphatidic acid  and sphingosine 1-phosphate  are critical regulators of neural development, modulating neural growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation.

lysophospholipid signaling has been implicated in mediating diverse physiological and pathological responses, including cancer progression, wound healing, angiogenesis, cardiovascular development, and, more recently, neural development . there is strong evidence that both lpa and s1p are critical in early neural development, as mouse embryos that lack enzymes for s1p or lpa synthesis exhibit severe neural tube defects. specifically, mice with genetic deletion of sphingosine kinases required for production of s1p developed cranial neural tube defects as a result of increased apoptosis, decreased mitosis and subsequent thinning of the neuroepithelial progenitor cell layer  <cit> . these data suggest that s1p mediates anti-apoptotic and pro-growth signaling in normal neuroepithelial development. similarly, genetic deletion of autotaxin, the enzyme responsible for production of lpa in the brain, yields embryonically lethal mice with neural tube defects. in these embryos, the neural tube fails to close completely and is kinked  <cit> . further, embryos lacking lpa exhibited asymmetric neural headfold, reflecting large effusions with high levels of apoptotic cells  <cit> . these studies demonstrate critical and distinct roles of s1p and lpa in early neural development.

lpa and s1p receptors are expressed in neural progenitors, neurons, and oligodendrocytes in the developing and adult brain, and both lpa and s1p are generated by neurons  <cit> . the biological consequences of lysophospholipid signaling in the nervous system are incompletely defined, but evidence for several roles in neural progenitors is emerging. as discussed above, there are clear roles for s1p and lpa in early neural tube development. further, lpa appears to regulate cortical neurogenesis by promoting morphological changes, survival, and differentiation  <cit> . finally, s1p activity is implicated in mediating migration of neural progenitor cells toward sites of spinal injury  <cit> . thus, lpa and s1p regulate critical responses in neural progenitor cells that may be exploited to manipulate these cells in traditional pharmacological or cell-based therapeutics.

lpa and s1p bind and activate cell surface g-protein coupled receptors  to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphological changes, all of which may contribute to their roles in regulating neural progenitor cell function. there are at least five distinct lpa receptors  and five s1p receptors   <cit> . lpa and s1p receptors couple to multiple g-protein pathways to regulate ion channel activity, adenylyl cyclase mediated cyclic amp  production, phospholipase c  mediated inositol phosphate production and calcium release, activation of the small gtpase rho, and transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinase receptors .

regulation of cell growth and morphology are common effects of lysophospholipids. lpa and s1p have potent proliferative effects in multiple neural cell lines  <cit> . for example, lpa induces proliferation in neurospheres isolated from rat embryonic cortex  <cit> , and application of s1p to neural progenitor cells from embryonic rat hippocampus has been shown to stimulate gi/o pathways which activate mitogen-activated protein  kinases and dna synthesis  <cit> . the latter observation is consistent with the mechanism for lysophospholipid stimulated proliferation in many cancer cells, in which lpa receptors transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor  pathway, resulting in map kinase activation and subsequent proliferation  <cit> .

lpa and s1p also stimulate specific cytoskeletal rearrangements, likely contributing to their roles in axonal pathfinding and migration. neural cell lines such as nie- <dig> cells and pc <dig> cells undergo rapid and transient neurite retraction in response to lpa and s1p  <cit> . lpa induces neurite retraction within minutes, and neurons re-extend neurites after lpa is removed; thus, the retraction is dynamic and may fine tune neurite growth  <cit> . similar neurite retraction and growth cone collapse occur in response to lpa in differentiating cortical neurons  <cit> . morphological changes also occur in neural progenitor cells, which lack distinct neurites. both lpa and s1p cause transient aggregation of rat hippocampal neural progenitor cells  <cit> , and lpa stimulates cluster contraction, lamellipodia retraction and migration toward the center of the cluster in mouse cortical neuroblasts  <cit> . lpa stimulates cell rounding of cortical neural progenitors, important in cortical neurogenesis  <cit> . the mechanisms for these effects is incompletely understood, but in most cases lpa and s1p induced morphological changes can be partially or completely blocked by pretreatment with inhibitors of the small gtpase rho or its primary effector in neurons, p <dig> rho kinase   <cit> .

the goal of the current study was to define functional lysophospholipid receptor signaling pathways in hes-nep cells. we have determined that functional lpa and s1p receptors are expressed in hes-neps and regulate second messenger pathways, map kinase-dependent cell proliferation, and rho-dependent morphology changes. these results contribute to the molecular characterization of hes-nep cells, and establish for the first time a human, multipotent, renewable model cell system in which to define the role of lpa and s1p in neural progenitor cell function.

RESULTS
lpa and s1p receptor mrna transcript expression changes during the transition from es cells to hes-nep cells
expression of transcript encoding all five lpa receptors has been reported in hes cells and in hes cell-derived neurospheres  <cit> , and three s1p receptors  have also been detected in hes cells  <cit> . as described, the hes-nep cell line used in this study was derived from the hes cell line, wa <dig>  we performed quantitative rt-pcr to determine expression of transcript of lpa and s1p receptor subtypes in hes-nep cells, and to determine if receptor expression changed in the transition from embryonic stem cell line to neural epithelial cell line. wa <dig> es cells had detectable levels of transcript for all five lpa receptor genes and all five s1p receptor genes; however, in the hes-nep population lpa <dig> and s1p <dig> were not expressed at detectable levels after  <dig> amplifications. because the rt-pcr primer pairs used have been shown to have equivalent amplification efficiency  at the annealing temperatures used, the relative expression of lpa and s1p receptors can be directly compared within hes-nep cell rna. the Δct value for each receptor transcript was determined by normalizing with ct values for the endogenous 18s ribosomal rna. as shown in figure 1a, lpa <dig> receptor transcript expression was significantly lower than lpa <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  similarly, s1p  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> transcripts were expressed at significantly higher levels in hes-nep cells than s1p <dig>  we further determined the fold change in transcript expression of lpa <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and s1p  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in hes-nep cells relative to their expression in the parent es cell line wa <dig>  lpa <dig> receptor transcript expression was increased approximately ten fold while lpa <dig> expression was decreased approximately five fold in cumulative data representing three experiments, but these changes did not meet criteria for statistical significance. expression of lpa <dig> and  <dig> mrna transcripts were relatively unchanged between the two populations. s1p <dig> receptor transcript was dramatically upregulated approximately forty fold in hes-nep cells relative to the parent es cell line , while significant changes were not observed in expression of s1p  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> transcript.

nep cells express functional lpa and s1p receptors
to evaluate expression of gpcrs for lpa and s1p as well as major neurotransmitter classes in hes-nep cells, we screened agonists of adrenergic, dopamine, muscarinic acetylcholine, lpa, and s1p receptors for activity in assays measuring second messenger production. first, we assessed activity of these compounds in inositol phosphate assays that measure plc activity. cells were stimulated with each of the following drugs at a concentration of  <dig> μm for  <dig> minutes: clonidine , epinephrine , quinpirole , bromocriptine , carbachol , and s1p ; 18: <dig>  lpa  was tested at a concentration of  <dig> μm due to loss of activity at higher concentrations. at these concentrations, only lpa and s1p stimulated a significant increase in inositol phosphate accumulation compared to vehicle treatment in hes-nep cells . we then generated lpa and s1p dose-response curves in these cells. the ec <dig> for inositol phosphate accumulation stimulated by either lpa or s1p is approximately  <dig> nm . pre-incubation with  <dig> ng/ml of the gi/o selective inhibitor pertussis toxin  for  <dig> hours did not inhibit s1p stimulated ip accumulation, indicating that this effect is not mediated by gi/o g-proteins, while ptx consistently inhibited 30–40% of the lpa stimulated ip accumulation .

we next determined if hes-nep cells express functional adrenergic, dopamine, or lysophospholipid receptors coupled to gs-like increases in camp production. hes-nep cells were treated with the same panel of agonist compounds , and none produced a significant increase in camp, suggesting there are not functional gs coupled lpa, s1p, adrenergic, or dopaminergic receptors expressed in hes-nep cells . finally, the receptor agonists were added to cells following activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin to determine if they could decrease camp production via gi/o mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor agonists had no effect on forskolin-stimulated camp levels, and carbachol produced a modest inhibition of camp production. in contrast, both lpa and s1p significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated camp accumulation by approximately 50% and 40%, respectively, at  <dig> μm doses . dose response curves demonstrated that lpa inhibited forskolin-stimulated camp accumulation with an ec <dig> of approximately  <dig> nm , while s1p had an ec <dig> of approximately  <dig> nm . the activity of both lpa and s1p was completely inhibited by pre-incubation of cells with  <dig> ng/ml ptx , confirming that this effect is mediated by gi/o g-proteins.

lpa and s1p promote growth of hes-nep cells via ptx-sensitive g-proteins, egf receptors, and map kinases
to examine the effects of s1p and lpa on cellular growth, we determined the ability of lpa and s1p to stimulate growth of cultured hes-nep cells over a  <dig> hour period by determining increases in cell number . hes-nep cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown to 50% confluence. cells were then grown for  <dig> hours with vehicle,  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm, or  <dig> nm lpa or s1p added to the normal growth media. cells were not subjected to starve conditions, and therefore continued to grow at a normal basal rate in the absence of added lysophospholipid. cells under basal growth conditions showed a 60% increase in cell number . addition of lysophospholipid resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cell growth from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm lpa  and from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm s1p , with s1p showing an apparent higher potency. cells treated with  <dig> nm lpa showed a 120% increase in cell number after  <dig> hours , and cells treated with  <dig> nm of s1p showed a similar 130% increase in cell number , as compared to the 60% increase in control cells. the basal growth rate was approximately linear over the  <dig> hour experiment , and this rate was increased significantly by addition of  <dig> nm of either lpa  or s1p  as early as  <dig> hours. the rate of growth of lpa and s1p treated cells slowed at later time points as these cells approached confluency.

map kinases such as p <dig> and p <dig> extracellular signal regulated kinases  are known to play an important role in neural progenitor cell proliferation  <cit> , and both lpa and s1p activate the map kinase pathway in multiple systems  <cit> . further, lpa has been shown to activate map kinase pathways through a gi/o-dependent egf receptor transactivation mechanism  <cit> . to determine which of these pathways is functional in lysophospholipid stimulated growth of hes-nep cells, the effects of pretreatment with specific pharmacological inhibitors of pathway intermediates were determined: the gi/o selective inhibitor ptx , the egf receptor inhibitor ag <dig> , the map kinase/erk kinase  inhibitor u <dig> , the direct erk inhibitor fr <dig> , and the p160rock inhibitor y <dig> . cells were counted after pre-treatment with inhibitor and again after an  <dig> hour incubation with lpa  or s1p . both lpa and s1p significantly induced increased cell growth over vehicle at this time point. pre-treatment with ptx, ag <dig>  u <dig>  and fr <dig> completely inhibited both basal cell growth and lpa and s1p stimulated growth; however, the p160rock inhibitor y <dig> did not significantly affect basal growth or growth stimulated by either lpa or s1p. further, pre-treatment with the inhibitors did not increase cell staining with trypan blue, indicating that these compounds were not cytotoxic at the concentrations used . these results suggest that lpa and s1p promote growth of hes-nep cells through a mechanism dependent on ptx-sensitive gi/o g-proteins, egf receptor, mek, and erk, but independent of the rho-associated kinase p160rock.

the data above implicate map kinase activation in the ability of lpa and s1p to stimulate cell growth. thus, we directly tested the ability of lpa and s1p to stimulate phosphorylation of the map kinase proteins p44/ <dig> erk. we performed western blotting on cellular lysates after treating cells with either  <dig> μm lpa or  <dig> nm s1p for time points between one and sixty minutes. lpa and s1p each stimulated p44/ <dig> erk phosphorylation relative to total p44/ <dig> erk protein, with peak phosphorylation occurring after  <dig> minutes of stimulation, followed by a later sustained lower level of phosphorylation at 30– <dig> minutes . the latter peak was consistently observed in both lpa and s1p treated cells, but did not meet statistical criteria for significance in lpa treated cells.

lpa and s1p induce reversible morphological changes in hes-nep cells
lpa and s1p mediate morphological changes reflecting cytoskeletal rearrangements in multiple neuronal cell types. we determined the effect of lpa and s1p on hes-nep cell morphology using continuous live cell microscopy. hes-nep cells were plated and maintained in an environmentally controlled slide incubator system that allows continuous video surveillance of live cells under controlled temperature and atmospheric conditions. after treatment with  <dig> μm lpa  or  <dig> nm s1p , hes-nep cells became aggregated and rounded, retracting cellular extensions. this morphological change was transient, reaching a peak at approximately  <dig> hours after treatment and returning to baseline  <dig> hours after treatment . addition of vehicle caused no morphological changes under these conditions . in contrast to the effects on the proliferative response, overnight pre-treatment of the cells with ptx, ag <dig>  or u <dig> did not block the ability of lpa  or s1p  to induce morphological changes, while pre-treatment with y <dig>  the inhibitor of p160rock, completely prevented cellular aggregation and rounding induced by either lysophospholipid. these data suggest that morphological changes induced by lpa and s1p are mediated by a pathway that does not include gi/o proteins, egf receptors, or mek, but does require the rho effector p <dig> rock. notably, ptx treatment alone caused some cellular aggregation; however, treatment with either lpa or s1p induced further cell rounding. further, cells pre-treated with y <dig> had longer, thinner membrane extensions than cells pre-treated with vehicle, consistent with previous observations by darenfed et al.  <cit> .

discussion
lysophospholipids are hypothesized to be critical regulators of neuronal differentiation, proliferation, and migration during development and following injury. while rodent neural progenitor cells and human transformed cell lines have been used to establish these roles and investigate the pathways responsible, the effects of lysophospholipids in human neural progenitor cells has not been established until now. this study establishes our recently characterized human embryonic neural epithelial progenitor cell line as a valid model system to define the role of lpa and s1p in neural progenitors during human neural development, differentiation, and wound healing.

our results demonstrate that hes-nep cells express functional lpa and s1p receptors coupled to gi/o mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and to a pertussis toxin-insensitive plc pathway, likely mediated by gq. hes-nep cells do not express functional gs coupled receptors for either lpa or s1p. like the camp inhibitory response, the proliferative response was also completely inhibited by pertussis toxin  and is therefore also mediated by gi/o coupled receptor subtypes. in contrast, the morphological response was not inhibited by ptx, and so is not mediated by gi/o coupled receptors. our data suggest that lpa and s1p morphological responses may be mediated by g <dig> coupled gpcrs, consistent with the observed rho-dependency, although we cannot rule out a gq-mediated mechanism. all lpa and s1p receptors except lpa <dig> and s1p <dig> were detected in hes-nep cells. studies including additional pharmacologically selective drugs are required to determine the molecular identity of the receptors mediating the observed responses in hes-nep cells.

both lpa and s1p stimulate proliferation of many cell types. studies in multiple cell lines  <cit>  suggest that lpa receptors coupled to gi/o stimulate cell growth via egf receptor transactivation and subsequent map kinase activation, which directly leads to cell proliferation. while we observed a strong effect of lysophospholipids on cell growth, our data do not distinguish between effects on proliferation versus survival pathways. future work should directly address the effect of lpa and s1p on apoptosis in these cells. indeed, lpa does function as a survival factor in many cancer cell types via activation of the pi <dig> kinase pathway. nonetheless, our data are consistent with the proliferative egf receptor transactivation mechanism described above. the growth responses to lpa and s1p in these cells were completely inhibited by ptx and inhibitors of egf receptors and erk map kinases, but not by inhibitors of p <dig> rock. notably, the basal growth of hes-nep cells was also inhibited by egfr and map kinase inhibitors but not p <dig> rock inhibitor, suggesting that basal growth is mediated by a similar pathway, although not necessarily initiated by lpa or s1p. this also suggests a basal level of erk map kinase activity. although the data shown in figure  <dig> do not show basal erk phosphorylation due to the short exposure times required to avoid saturation of peak bands for quantification, in longer exposures basal erk phosphorylation was apparent .

the proliferative effect of lpa has been directly demonstrated in rat embryonic neural stem cells  <cit> . cui et al. report a bell-shaped lpa dose response relationship in proliferation assays in which lpa increased thymidine incorporation at concentrations between  <dig> nanomolar and  <dig> micromolar, but inhibited proliferation at higher concentrations. this biphasic effect of lpa on proliferation is consistent with both our observation that lpa stimulates hes-nep cell growth between  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, and a recent report in which  <dig> micromolar lpa did not stimulate proliferation in human neurospheres  <cit> . similarly, lpa stimulated production of inositol phosphates reached a maximal level at  <dig> μm and a reduced activation at higher concentrations.

lpa and s1p effects on morphology of either neurons or neural progenitors are mediated by effects on the actin cytoskeleton and/or microtubules, and effects are typically, but not always, dependent on the small gtpase protein rho. rho is known to regulate axonal growth, neuronal differentiation, and neuronal survival, primarily through its well-characterized neuronal effector p <dig> rock . rho activation occurs primarily via activation of rho exchange factors by g proteins of the g <dig> subfamily, and leads to activation of p <dig> rock which mediates morphological changes by altering cytoskeletal structure. specifically, p <dig> rock increases actin contractility and stress fiber formation via myosin-ii regulatory light chain   <cit>  and decreases actin depolymerization via lim kinases to regulate growth cone collapse  <cit> . alternately, gi/o pathways can also alter the cytoskeleton through activation of glycogen synthase kinase- <dig>   <cit>  or rac, which promotes cell spreading  <cit> .

the effect of lpa on neural cell morphology varies with cell type and distinct morphology changes occur over different time scales. typically, in neurons or neuronal cell lines that have neurites or growth cones, these retract and cells round in response to lpa within minutes. in nie- <dig> and ng108- <dig> cells, and b <dig> cells expressing either lpa <dig> or lpa <dig>  lpa causes a rapid, transient rounding which initiates at  <dig> minutes following lpa addition, and cells recover their flattened morphology after  <dig> minutes, even in the continued presence of lpa  <cit> . alternately, in rat hippocampal np cells both lpa and s1p cause transient aggregation with a maximal response at  <dig> hours and a return to baseline at  <dig> hours  <cit> . similarly, in b <dig> cells expressing exogenous lpa <dig>  but not lpa <dig>  lpa stimulated a slow aggregation that peaked at three hours  <cit> . like the rapid cell rounding, the slow cell aggregation response is dependent on the rho effector p <dig> rock, as was the slow cell aggregation observed in this report. in contrast, the known activation time course of p <dig> rho kinase is on a scale of minutes, and rho activation occurs even faster. thus, even though this response is dependent on rho/rho kinase activation, these are not the rate limiting factors in the response. in our experiments, lpa or s1p were added to the media and not washed out throughout the experiment. the long recovery time of shape changes may reflect time course of lpa stability in the media. consistent with this explanation, when media was changed to remove s1p one hour after addition to cells, morphology changes immediately began to reverse.

our data clearly implicate rho-mediated activation of rock in mediating lpa and s1p stimulated rounding and aggregation in hes-nep cells. inhibition of p <dig> rock completely blocked lpa and s1p stimulated effects, while both phospholipids could still mediate cell aggregation and rounding following inactivation of egfr, or erk. although lpa and s1p still clearly altered cell morphology following treatment with ptx, ptx treatment itself induced modest cell aggregation. this effect of ptx may reflect inhibition of basal gi/o mediated effects on gsk- <dig> or rac as described above.

while the current study describes lpa and s1p effects on proliferation and morphological changes, hes-neps are also a promising model cell system in which to study lpa and s1p effects in multiple processes of neural development. there is growing evidence that s1p and lpa regulate neuronal differentiation; however, data from various models report contradictory effects  <cit> . for example, lpa is reported to increase neuronal differentiation of rat neural progenitors   <cit>  and mouse neurosphere cultures  <cit> , while more recently lpa was shown to inhibit neuronal differentiation of human es cell-derived neurosphere cultures  <cit> . these contradictions may reflect bona fide differences in lpa signaling pathways in rodent versus human neural differentiation, or they may be a result of mixed cell populations and the various sources and developmental stages from which the neural stem cells were isolated. for example, significant differences in expression of fgf, wnt and lif pathway genes are observed between human neural stem cells derived from hes cells and fetal neural stem cells  <cit> . given these potential differences between neural stem cells from different cell sources, homogeneous multi-potent human es cell-derived neuroepithelial  cells may be a superior model system in which to elucidate the roles of lpa and s1p cell signaling pathways in neural progenitor cells. future studies of lpa and s1p effects on differentiation in the homogenous hes-nep cell system will serve to clarify the effect of lysophospholipids on human neural differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have defined lpa and s1p signaling pathways in hes-nep cells that promote cellular growth and morphological changes by distinct mechanisms. this cell system is superior to rodent and transformed cell systems in which lpa and s1p effects have been defined by virtue of its human origin, multi-potent status, and non-transformed state. further, as a stable, homogeneous, adherent, renewable cell line, hes-nep cells are a convenient model system for future studies defining the functional role of lysophospholipids in proliferation, differentiation, and migration in the developmentally important human neural progenitor cell type.
