BACKGROUND
serine proteinase inhibitors  inactivate their target proteinases through a suicide substrate-like inhibitory mechanism. the proteinase binds covalently to the reactive center loop  of the serpin and cleaves the scissile bond at the p1-p1' site. the rcl then moves to the opposite side to form the β-sheet a and a distortion in the structure of the proteinase that results in its inactivation  <cit> . not all serpins, however, exert proteinase inhibitory activity. some examples are corticosteroid and thyroxine binding globulins, which function as hormone transport proteins  <cit> , the chaperone heat shock protein  <dig>  <cit> , mammary serine protease inhibitor , which increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis  <cit> , and pigment epithelium derived factor , which has neurotrophic, neuroprotective, antiangiogenic, and proapoptotic actions  <cit> .

another class of serpins without apparent proteinase activity is the uterine serpins. these proteins, which are produced by the endometrial epithelium of the pregnant cow, sow, sheep, and goat  <cit> , have been classified as either a separate clade of the serpin superfamily  <cit>  or as a highly-diverge group of the α1-antitrypsin clade  <cit> . the best characterized protein of this unique group of serpins is ovine uterine serpin . this basic glycoprotein is a weak inhibitor of aspartic proteinases   <cit> , but it does not inhibit a broad range of serine proteinases  <cit> . additionally, amino acids in the hinge region of inhibitory serpins are not conserved in uterine serpins and ovus behaves different in the presence of guanidine hcl than for inhibitory serpins  <cit> .

the biological function of ovus during pregnancy may be to inhibit immune cell proliferation during pregnancy and provide protection for the allogeneically-distinct conceptus  <cit> . ovine us decreases proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated with concanavalin a, phytohemagglutinin , candida albicans, and the mixed lymphocyte reaction  <cit> . in addition, ovus decreases natural killer cell cytotoxic activity, abortion induced by polypoly in mice  <cit>  and the production of antibody in sheep immunized with ovalbumin  <cit> . the antiproliferative actions of ovus are not limited to lymphocytes. ovine us decreases development of the bovine embryos and proliferation of mouse lymphoma, canine primary osteogenic sarcoma and human prostate cancer cell lines  <cit> .

the mechanism by which ovus inhibits proliferation of cells is unknown. the protein could block activation of cell proliferation, inhibit the cell cycle at other points or induce apoptosis or other forms of cell death. for the pc- <dig> prostate cancer line, inhibition of cell proliferation by ovus might involve reduction in interleukin- <dig>  secretion because of the importance of autosecretion of this cytokine for cell androgen-independent proliferation  <cit> . the goal of the present study was to evaluate the mechanism by which ovus inhibits cell proliferation. using pc- <dig> cells as a model system, it was tested whether inhibition of dna synthesis involves cytotoxic action of ovus, induction of apoptosis or disruption of the il- <dig> autocrine loop. it was also tested whether ovus blocks specific steps in the cell cycle for pc- <dig> cells and lymphocytes.

RESULTS
proliferation of pc- <dig> cells
the antiproliferative effects of rovus on proliferation of pc- <dig> cells were evaluated by two different assays. in the first experiment, it was shown that rovus caused a concentration-dependent decrease in incorporation of thymidine into dna  with the minimum effective concentration being  <dig> μg/ml . the antiproliferative actions of ovus using thymidine uptake as the measure of proliferation has been demonstrated previously for pc- <dig> cells and other cell types  <cit> . to confirm this effect of rovus reflected an inhibition in cell proliferation and not a disruption in thymidine uptake by the cells, antiproliferative effects were also evaluated by an assay in which the relative total number of cells per well was estimated by the atp content per well. treatment with rovus reduced atp content per well at all concentrations tested  . in contrast, the control serpin, ovalbumin, did not cause effect in the atp content per well. the finding that rovus reduced atp content per well confirms that the effects of ovus to reduce thymidine incorporation reflect a reduction in cell proliferation rather than interference with thymidine transport into the cell.

lactate dehydrogenase release
possible cytotoxic effects of rovus on pc- <dig> cells were evaluated by measurements of lactate dehydrogenase release into culture medium . none of the concentrations of rovus or ova tested caused an increase in the percent of lysed cells during culture. thus, rovus does not inhibit proliferation through induction of cell death.

dna fragmentation 
the tunel procedure was used to test whether rovus decreased cell proliferation by induction of dna fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis and other forms of cell death. representative images of tunel labeled cells are shown in figure  <dig> and the average percent of cells that were tunel positive is shown in figure  <dig>  treatment of pc- <dig> with either rovus or the control protein ova did not increase the percent of cells that were tunel positive at either  <dig> or  <dig> h after treatment; the percentage of cells that were tunel positive was low for all groups . the fact that rovus did not induce apoptosis makes the action of this serpin distinct from that of two other serpins that inhibit cell proliferation. both maspin  <cit>  and pedf  <cit>  are proapoptotic serpins.

interleukin- <dig> secretion
interleukin- <dig> accumulation in the medium was measured because of the autocrine effect of this chemokine on prostate cell proliferation  <cit> . in addition, at least one class of molecule that inhibits pc- <dig> cell proliferation, soy isoflavones, also reduces il- <dig> secretion  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  there was, however, no effect of rovus on accumulation of il- <dig> into conditioned cultured medium. thus, rovus does not block pc- <dig> cell proliferation through inhibition of il- <dig> secretion.

cell cycle dynamics
dynamics through the different phases of the cell cycle were affected by the treatment of pc- <dig> cells with rovus. representative dna histograms after treatment with vehicle or  <dig> μg/ml rovus are shown in figures 7a and 7b while least-squares means ± sem for for results at  <dig> and  <dig> h after treatment are shown in figures 7c and 7d, respectively. at  <dig> h after addition of treatments, rovus decreased  the percent of cells in s phase and increased  the percent of cells in the g2/m phase . there was no effect of rovus on the percent of cells in g0/g <dig>  at  <dig> h after addition of treatment,  <dig> μg/ml rovus increased the percent of cells in g0/g <dig> , decreased the percent of cells in s phase , and did not affect the percent of cells in g2/m phase .

control of the cell cycle dynamics by rovus was also evaluated in a second cell type – the peripheral blood lymphocyte. representative dna histograms for pha-treated lymphocytes are shown for control cells and cells treated with  <dig> μg/ml rovus in figures 8a and 8b, respectively while least-squares means ± sem are shown in figures 8c and 8d. at both  <dig>  and  <dig> h  after addition of pha, rovus increased  the proportion of lymphocytes in the g0/g <dig> phase and decreased  the proportion of cells in the s phase. in contrast, there was no effect of the control protein  on the distribution of cells in the cell cycle.

these results indicate that ovus block cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest in both pc- <dig> cells and lymphocytes. the differences in specific stages at which the cell cycle was blocked between pc- <dig> cells and lymphocytes is likely to be caused by differences in activation and regulation pathways for these two cell types. unlike pc- <dig> cells, lymphocytes are arrested at g <dig> until proliferation is induced by addition of pha. inhibition at points in the cell cycle other than g0/g <dig> are less likely to be seen since few cells progress to later stages of the cell cycle. in addition, it is possible that genetic mutations in pc- <dig> cells compromise some potential regulatory mechanisms. in particular, unlike lymphocytes, pc- <dig> cells lack functional p <dig>  <cit>  which causes cell cycle arrest at g1/s by inducing p21cip <dig> that inhibits cyclin dependent kinases  <cit> .

the mechanism by which ovus inhibits cell cycle dynamics is not understood. one serpin has been identified which can affect cell cycle regulatory proteins. this serpin, myeloid and erythroid nuclear termination stage-specific protein , is a nuclear protein that inhibits cell proliferation through interactions with a nuclear protein with papain-like cysteine proteinase activity  <cit> . inhibition of the proteinase prevents degradation of the cell cycle protein rb although antiproliferative effects may depend more on other actions of ment to mediate euchromatin condensation in an rb-independent manner  <cit> . in any case, ovus, is apparently without proteinase inhibitory activity and is an extracellular protein that is unlikely to achieve a nuclear localization. the antipepsin activity of uterine serpin is probably not biologically significant. ovus is a very weak inhibitor of pepsin c  c and the binding of ovus to pepsin is electrostatic  <cit> . moreover, pepsin shows an acidic ph optimum and is unlikely to be involved in cell proliferation under the conditions utilized.

a major point in the cell cycle regulated by ovus is transition from g0/g <dig> to s phase: rovus decreased the proportion of cells in s phase in all experiments and increased the proportion of cells in g0/g <dig> at  <dig> h after treatment for pc- <dig> cells and at both times examined for lymphocytes. ovine uterine serpin can bind to cell membranes  <cit>  and, perhaps, ovus inhibits proliferation by activation of signal transduction systems that inhibit transition from g0/g <dig> to s phase or prevents pro-proliferative molecules in culture medium from binding their receptors. experiments with rp-8-cl-camps, a selective inhibitor of camp-dependent type-i protein kinase a, indicated that effects of ovus on proliferation of pha-stimulated lymphocytes are not dependent on this kinase  <cit> . studies to determine activation of other anti-proliferative signal transduction systems by ovus are warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicates that the mechanism by which ovus inhibits proliferation of pc- <dig> cells and lymphocytes involves cell cycle arrest and not, at least for pc- <dig> cells, apoptosis, cytotoxicity or inhibition of il- <dig> secretion.
