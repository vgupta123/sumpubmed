BACKGROUND
hepatitis b virus  is the prototype of the hepadnaviridae family characterized by dna viruses with tropism to hepatic cells. hbv is an etiologic agent of human liver diseases, including acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. as such, it constitutes a significant public health problem, estimated to chronically infect more than  <dig> million people worldwide .

the hbv genome is a partially double-stranded circular dna molecule approximately  <dig>  kb in length. the viral proteins are encoded by four partially overlapping open reading frames , which allow the virus to produce 50% more proteins than would be predicted by the small genome size. hbvs also have an unusual replication strategy. because they first synthesize rna intermediates from which dna is synthesized by reverse transcription, the hbv dna viruses have substitution rates more than 10-fold higher than other dna viruses.

on the basis of genetic differences, hbv have been classified into eight genomic groups . entire genome sequences within each group diverge from other groups by more than 8%. these eight groups have distinct geographical distributions  <cit> . genotype a is distributed globally and is the main genotype found in europe, north america, africa and india. genotypes b and c are predominant in east and southeast asia, and australia. genotype d is mainly found in the middle east and mediterranean countries but has been reported globally, whereas genotype e seems to be predominant in west africa. genotype g has been characterized in samples from usa, mexico and france, and genotypes f and h are found exclusively in central and south america .

some genotypes have been further subdivided into subgroups  with distinct geographic origins. the hbv genotype a strain is now divided into three genetic clusters. subgenotype a <dig> represents isolates with an african-asian origin, whereas subgenotype a <dig> includes isolates with european-north american origin  <cit> . recently, a new subgenotype, designated a <dig>  was described in cameroon  <cit> . genotypes b  <cit> , and c  <cit>  have each been subdivided into four subgenotypes, and genotype d  <cit>  has been subdivided into five subgenotypes. genotype f, which constitutes the most divergent group  <cit> , is indigenous to the americas and is the major circulating genotype in argentina  <cit> , venezuela  <cit> , the peruvian amazon basin  <cit> , northern brazil  <cit>  and central american countries, including costa rica, el salvador and nicaragua  <cit> . recently, two subgenotypes, f <dig> and f <dig>  have been proposed for this genotype, each characterized by a specific amino acid residue, leu <dig> and thr <dig>  respectively, in the small  gene product  <cit> . a subdivision of isolates from genotype f into five clusters  has also been proposed by mbayed et al. on the basis of comparisons between s gene sequences  <cit> . clusters ia and ib, associated with subgenotype f <dig>  are representative of strains found mainly in central america and argentina, respectively. subgenotype f <dig> includes clusters ii , iii  and iv  .

brazil is a federation of  <dig> states and one federal district occupying approximately  <dig> , <dig> km <dig> divided broadly into five geographic regions: north, northeast, central-west, southeast and south. early studies have shown variability in hbv prevalence in different brazilian regions. the amazon basin, corresponding to the north region and the northern portions of the central-west region, is characterized by a rate of endemic hbv infection, in contrast to the low prevalence found in southern regions of the country  <cit> . brazil, a country with a highly miscegenated population, exhibits an hbv genotype circulation pattern that is distinct from the distribution found in other latin american countries, with genotypes a, d and f being the most prevalent among hbv carriers  <cit> .

in this study, we performed a molecular characterization of hbv strains derived from hbsag-positive blood donors living in different brazilian regions. s region nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed to determine the relationships between hbv genotype f isolates from brazil and from other american countries.

RESULTS
distribution of hbv genotypes in brazil
genotyping by pcr-rflp of  <dig> hbv isolates from all five brazilian geographic regions demonstrated that genotypes a, d and f were present at different frequencies; no other genotypes were identified in the samples analyzed. genotype a was the most prevalent in the north , northeast  and southeast  regions. genotype d was the most prevalent in south , whereas genotype f isolates were absent in this region . in the center of the country, represented by the central-west region, there was a balanced distribution of genotypes a  and d . countrywide, genotype a was the most common , followed by genotype d  and genotype f .

as shown in a previous work  <cit> , the pcr-rflp genotyping method divided each genotype in different rflp patterns. in the current study, a total of thirteen rflp patterns were observed . genotype a isolates were subdivided into four patterns, ai-aiv, the great majority of which were classified as ai or aii . among the five rflp patterns found for genotype d , patterns di and dii were the most prevalent . for genotype f, fi was the most frequent pattern  of the four patterns found .

phylogenetic analysis of the small  gene and amino acid replacements
the results of pcr-frlp analysis were confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing of hbv s gene pcr products from  <dig> of  <dig> samples , including randomly selected samples from genotype a  and genotype d , and  <dig> samples from genotype f. no discrepancies were found between the two methods. among genotype a samples, 15/ <dig>  were classified as subgenotype a <dig> and 7/ <dig>  as subgenotype a <dig>  a phylogenetic analysis of genotype d samples assigned 10/ <dig>  to subgenotype d <dig> and 3/ <dig>  to subgenotype d <dig>  the deduced amino acid sequence of the s gene product and an analysis of antigenic determinant a residues  <dig> and  <dig> confirmed the expected serotype pattern of all but one genotyped sample. all  <dig> hbv genotype a samples were classified as serotype adw <dig>  nine genotype d samples were classified as serotypes ayw <dig> and three were identified as ayw <dig>  of the  <dig> hbv genotype f samples,  <dig> were adw <dig>  and one, 052-n, had an unusual substitution of isoleucine for leucine at residue  <dig>  three hbv genotype a isolates  were shown to harbor tyrosine to cysteine substitutions in determinant a residue  <dig> , and the t118v-a128v double mutant was found in three genotype d isolates . the partial amino acid sequence of hbv polymerase showed amino acid substitutions related to the lamivudine-resistance phenotype in two isolates derived from this group of hbsag positive blood donors. one  displayed the double rtl180m-rtm204v lamivudine-resistance mutation and the other  showed an additional rtv173l mutation, which is also associated with lamivudine resistance  <cit>  .

molecular characterization of genotype f isolates
a phylogenetic analysis of the s gene sequences from  <dig> hbv genotype f isolates  in a set with  <dig> international hbv genotype f sequences , classified genotype f isolates into five different subgroups . using the topology of the phylogenetic tree, we were able to identify the subgenotypes f <dig> and f <dig> . the vast majority of brazilian genotype f strains determined in the present study  were classified as subgenotype f <dig>  whereas only two samples  were grouped into subgenotype f <dig>  an amino acid analysis supported this finding, showing that all samples grouped into the f <dig> subgenotype by the phylogenetic analysis contained a threonine at position  <dig> of the s gene product, whereas the two subgenotype f <dig> samples had a leucine at this position . the tree topology also allowed us to identify the five genotype f clusters . twenty-eight of  <dig> samples analyzed  were classified into cluster ii and  <dig> samples  were assigned to cluster iv; the two subgenotype f <dig> samples were related to cluster ib. correlating the rflp patterns and the phylogenetic clusters of isolates belonging to genotype f for all brazilian samples, we found that samples characterized as rflp pattern fi were grouped in cluster ii, whereas those classified as fii and fiii on the basis of rflp patterns were related to isolates from cluster iv and ib, respectively.

discussion
the previously described co-circulation of hbv genotypes a, d and f in brazil  <cit>  was confirmed in the present study, which also found that no other hbv genotypes were present in a sample of  <dig> blood donors. the identification of genotype prevalence patterns in brazil that are distinct from worldwide geographic distribution patterns could be a reflection of the intensely migratory and highly miscegenated character of the brazilian population. genotypes b and c, previously identified in a few brazilian individuals, all of asian origin  <cit> , have not been detected in the present study. the absence of genotypes b and c may be explained by a combination of a limited sample size and an unbalanced distribution of individuals from asian origin throughout the brazilian territory .

the distribution of hbv genotypes a and d in brazil seemed to follow a gradient from northern to southern regions . north, northeast and southeast regions showed a higher prevalence of genotype a, the most common genotype in brazil. the high rate of genotype d isolates in the south region could be related to the influx of immigrants from central europe  that occurred in that region at the beginning of the 20th century. the balanced distribution of genotypes a and d in the central-west region could be explained by the delayed occupation of that area by population migration flows from south, southeast and northeast regions.

hbv genotype a had been initially divided into two genetic subgroups, a <dig> and a <dig>  on the basis of sequence divergence  <cit> . a previously described pcr-rflp genotyping method has classified hbv isolates into more than  <dig> patterns  <cit> . sequences showing patterns ai, aii and avi clustered in subgroup a <dig>  whereas those showing patterns aiii and av were found exclusively in subgroup a <dig>  in the present study, the rflp and sequence analyses of genotype a isolates circulating in brazil showed a high prevalence of isolates from subgroup a <dig> , corroborating previous results and indicating that the hbv genotype a circulating in latin america is not exclusively associated with the european influx, as once thought . on the contrary, the massive african forced migration during the colonial times  was a major contributor to the hbv circulation currently found in brazil. the absence of genotype e, which circulates in sub-saharan africa where substantial slave traffic occurred, could be explained by the relatively recent emergence of this genotype as a human pathogen, dating from the mid to late 19th century  <cit>  when the slave trade had already been abolished.

a large-scale study on the geographic distribution of hbsag subtypes in brazil, published in the late 1980s, reported a high incidence of adw <dig>  in all regions, except the south region, where subtypes ayw <dig> and ayw <dig>  were the most prevalent  <cit> . these results are in accord with our current results. however, other findings of this previous study, including the reported absence of subtypes other than adw <dig> in northeast region, a vast majority of the adw <dig> subtype in the central-west region, and the high prevalence of subtype adw <dig>  in the north region, are not corroborated by our study. these discrepancies may be explained by differences in methodology: because the former study classified hbv isolates on the basis of differences in antigenic determinants  <cit> , which usually requires high titers of hbsag for subtype determination, it may have mischaracterized low titer samples that are readily classified using genotypic analyses. alternatively, divergent conclusions could arise due to differences in sampling that affect the population under study and lead to a genotype prevalence bias with an underestimation of genotype f. for example, the current study analyzed serum samples from blood banks located in state capitals of brazil, a sampling strategy that would tend to under-represent certain groups, such as amerindians, that are not often voluntary blood donors. it is also possible that a given genotype induces more symptomatic infection, leading to a reduction in its prevalence in the potential blood donor population. further studies comparing clinical outcomes in patients infected with genotypes a, d and f will be required to address this question.

in general, hbv genotype f, which is native to the amerindians, showed a low prevalence in brazil . this was true even in the north region where the native amerindian population comprises a larger fraction of the total population. this result supports the findings of moraes et al.  <cit>  and contrasts with the high prevalence of genotype f described in other south american countries, including venezuela  <cit>  and argentina  <cit> . these data indicate that, in brazil, the native amerindian population has made a minor contribution to the population as a whole, a fact supported by an analysis of mitochondrial dna  <cit> .

as a starting point for establishing a molecular characterization of brazilian hbv genotype f isolates, we determined s gene sequences. when combined with a phylogenetic analysis, nucleotide sequences of individual genes, in particular the s gene, can reveal relationships that help to elucidate the molecular epidemiology of hbv  <cit> . the topology of the hbv genotype f phylogenetic tree showed that the great majority of brazilian strains characterized in the present study could be classified as subgenotype f <dig>  cluster ii. two previous studies have described one brazilian sequence belonging to cluster ii  <cit> . in the present study, hbv genotype f isolates with sequences closely related to those grouped in clusters iv and ib were found, suggesting that brazilian genotype f strains may not be derived from one another. assuming that the five samples previously characterized as genotype f from the apurinã tribe  represent the native original hbv of the brazilian indians, and further assuming that the great majority of brazilian genotype f sequences determined in this study was closely related to them, it is reasonable to infer that hbv genotype f circulating in brazil is mainly derived from the native aboriginal populations. however, the differences observed between the two sequences grouped in cluster ib  and the other genotype f sequences could indicate that two or three viral populations with distinct origin circulate in brazil. moreover, the existence of this well-defined cluster as the representative brazilian isolate would indicate that hbv genotype f arose from a common ancestor, but evolved separately after becoming isolated in different regions of the americas.

genotyping using pcr-rflp analysis and nucleotide sequencing gave the same result for all  <dig> samples tested, indicating that our pcr-rflp genotyping method is appropriate for large-scale studies. similar to our previous report on genotype a isolates  <cit> , our results here demonstrate an interesting correlation between the rflp patterns identified and the cluster analysis of hbv genotype f isolates. all fi rflp-pattern isolates subjected to nucleotide sequencing were found to group into genotype f cluster ii, whereas the two isolates grouped in cluster iv  and the two isolates grouped in cluster ib  were classified as rflp pattern fii and fiii, respectively. although more extensive sampling will be necessary to confirm this relationship, it is possible that rflp patterns could be used to establish to which cluster the hbv genotype f isolate is related.

the identification of a novel isoleucine substitution at residue  <dig> in one hbv genotype f isolate  classified by serotype using amino acid analysis reinforces the need for further investigation of genotype f strains. the deduced amino acid sequence of the s gene product also revealed three isolates bearing the determinant a substitution y100c, which is associated with the hbsag-negative/anti-hbc-positive phenotype in blood donors from venezuela  <cit>  and has been found in an hbsag-positive brazilian patient  <cit> . further studies will be required to determine whether this mutation is truly related to a reduction in hbsag detection. the t118v-a128v double mutation was found in three genotype d/ayw <dig>  isolates. these substitutions, which have been found in other subgenotype d <dig> isolates  <cit> , have recently been identified in brazil , spain, sweden and poland  <cit> .

the deduced amino acid sequence of hbv polymerase showed that two isolates had substitutions in residues associated with lamivudine resistance. the frequent lamivudine-resistance rtl180m-rtm204v double mutation was detected in two isolates , while a third isolate  displayed a rare rtv173l-rtl180m-rtm204v triple mutation . this triple mutant is known to exhibit reduced in vitro affinity for anti-hbs antibodies, similar to the hepatitis b vaccine escape mutant g145r  <cit> . these findings were unexpected given that the samples analyzed in the present study were derived from blood donors, a group of individuals not undergoing lamivudine therapy. however, lamivudine-resistant isolates would eventually be expected to circulate in the environment as a result of contact with chronic hepatitis b patients undergoing lamivudine antiviral therapy, allowing healthy individuals, including blood donors, to become exposed to a primary infection with an hbv mutant strain. the presence of lamivudine-resistant isolates could also be related to previously reports of hbv isolates with a ymdd motif mutation in chronic hepatitis b patients not treated with lamivudine  <cit> .

the evolutionary origins of hbv remain ill defined. although some early studies have suggested a new world origin for this virus, the data are ambiguous and specific inferences should be drawn with caution  <cit> . the diversification of hbv genotypes is poorly understood, but estimates based on phylogenetic divergence rates have calculated that hbv genotypes diverged less than  <dig> years ago . the origin of genotype f is particularly obscure, and may represent the first split from the human hepadnaviral ancestor . as many authors have noted, a refined analysis of the evolutionary history of hbv will require more extensive sampling of hbv genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the distribution of hbv genotypes a and d identified in the present study followed an apparent gradient from northern to southern regions of brazil, possibly reflecting the influence of early populations and settlement patterns during the process of occupying the country. the high prevalence of isolates from subgroup a <dig>  may denote a major contribution of forced african influx during the colonial slavery period to the current hbv genotype a circulation in brazil.

in contrast to other latin american countries, hbv genotype f showed a low prevalence in brazil , even in the north region where the native aboriginal population has a greater influence. the topology of the phylogenetic tree for hbv genotype f strains allowed the classification of most strains into subgenotype f <dig> within cluster ii. the existence of this well-defined cluster as the representative brazilian isolate would indicate that hbv genotype f arose from a common ancestor, but evolved separately after becoming isolated in different regions of the americas. the presence of some isolates of clusters iv and i  argues for the existence of two or more founder viral populations of genotype f in brazil. because the diversification of hbv genotypes remains poorly understood, particularly that of genotype f, more extensive sampling of hbv genomes would be helpful in unraveling the complex evolutionary history of hbv.
