BACKGROUND
planted forests constitute only 7% of the global forested area, but contribute to a significant proportion of overall forest goods and services . in the context of climate change, the adaptation of planted forests is essential for a sustainable forestry sector. the adaptation of industrial plantations to present and future environmental conditions  depends on several factors, including the genetic diversity of the material used for reforestation and the phenotypic plasticity of individual genotypes. genetic diversity ensures that forest trees can survive, adapt and evolve under changing environmental conditions  <cit> , whereas phenotypic plasticity constitutes a shorter term response to environmental changes at the individual level of particular importance in long-lived organisms, such as trees  <cit> .

eucalyptus is one of the key genera among planted trees. the genus is includes the most important hardwood fibre crops species planted worldwide . several eucalyptus species grow rapidly and are highly adaptable. these properties led to their introduction worldwide, at latitudes extending from southern europe to south africa. in its natural range , eucalyptus are also found in a diverse spectrum of ecological niches. the genetic diversity of eucalyptus has been studied extensively and remarkable levels of variation have been detected using neutral markers  <cit>  and in genes possibly involved in adaptive traits  <cit> . phenotypic plasticity is also likely to ensure better adaptation of individual genotypes to changing environmental conditions  <cit>  and is of particular importance in clonal forestry.

ecophysiological studies have shown that water is the principal factor limiting stem growth in eucalyptus . moreover, some studies have reported that eucalyptus genotypes differ in terms of their capacity for phenotypic modification in response to water deficit  <cit> . several physiological mechanisms for coping with drought have been described in these species: i) the regulation of transpiration to decrease water loss  <cit> , ii) resource reallocation from the shoot to the root, to increase water uptake  <cit> , and iii) adjustment of osmotic potential  <cit>  or protection against reactive oxygen species, to prevent damage due to stress  <cit> . drought tolerance mechanisms have been described in detail at the molecular level for both annual and perennial model plants, such as arabidopsis  <cit>  and populus  <cit> , but little is known about the molecular basis of drought tolerance in eucalyptus, particularly in field conditions.

next-generation sequencing  provides new opportunities for studies of the molecular plasticity in response to water deficit. the high throughput of ngs is particularly useful in non-model organisms for which few genomic resources are available  <cit> . moreover, ngs is suitable for transcript profiling, combining the high throughput of serial analysis of gene expression  with the functional annotation capacity of est sequencing  <cit> . these techniques have been widely used for transcriptome profiling, particularly for studies of biotic  <cit>  and abiotic  <cit>  stress responses, and the characterisation of developmental processes  <cit> . considerable sequencing depth can be obtained, making it possible to identify transcriptome expression variation  <cit> .

in plants, the shoot apical meristem  is a key organ in stem development. the sam initiates phytomers and regulates shoot growth by integrating several signals, such as hormones  and transcription   <cit> . when plants are subjected to environmental stimuli, the leaf developmental network is adjusted by changes in shoot apex activation  <cit> . in eucalyptus, est resources have been developed for various tissues, such as roots, leaves and wood-forming tissues  <cit> , but a limited number of genomic resources are available for shoot apices, despite the important role of this organ in plant organogenesis.

in this study, we compared transcript profiles in the shoot apices of two eucalyptus genotypes used in industrial plantations, under two watering regimes -- irrigated  versus non-irrigated . the two genotypes differ in their growth rates and ecophysiological characteristics at maturity, with one genotype being more productive and water use-efficient than the other. we used pyrosequencing  to sequence non-normalized cdna libraries constructed from shoot tip mrna. after verifying technical reproducibility, we addressed the following questions: i) are there molecular differences between genotypes, reflected in the contrasting phenotypes, and do these differences affect specific pathways or have a random effect on the transcriptome? ii) can we detect molecular plasticity in the response to water shortage during the dry season, and which pathways are affected? iii) does this plasticity differ between genotypes , and which genes or pathways reflect these differences?

methods
plant material
we compared the response of two eucalyptus genotypes, 1- <dig>  and 18- <dig> , to water shortage during the dry season of  <dig>  these two genotypes are used in industrial plantations in the republic of congo. hybrid 1- <dig>  was obtained by open pollination of e. alba  and the hybrid 18- <dig>  was derived from a controlled pollination of e. urophylla  by e. grandis . these two hybrids differ in their growth rates and water use efficiency  at maturity, g <dig> being superior than g <dig> 

field experiment
trees were vegetatively propagated by rooted cuttings and established in a field experiment in yanika, republic of congo , in june  <dig>  trees were planted in plots of  <dig> cuttings per genotype and per treatment, including a buffer zone of  <dig> plants. two watering regimes were used during the dry season: no irrigation  and irrigation . trees were watered with sprinklers, to replenish evapotranspiration losses, estimated at  <dig> mm per day. in order to evaluate the effect of water deficit on above-ground biomass growth and molecular plasticity, plant material was sampled in september  <dig>   <dig> months after the trees were planted. the dry season began approximately on may 15th  <dig> -therefore, trees under ni treatment were subjected to four months without rainfall by the time samples were collected.

soil water content
volumetric water content  was measured by time domain reflectometry . four series of tdr probes per genotype and per treatment were installed horizontally, at six depths . mean values were calculated from the four replicated measurements at each depth.

biomass production
we harvested  <dig> trees per treatment and dissected them into the following compartments: stem, dead branches, living branches and leaves. each compartment was weighed in the field. representative subsamples of each compartment were then harvested, and weighed before and after drying at  <dig> °c to constant weight. water content was calculated for each of these subsamples and used to estimate total dry biomass for each compartment. total above-ground biomass  was analysed by two-way anova, with r , according to the following model:

 xijk=μ+a⋅gi+b⋅tj+c⋅ij+εijk 

where xijk is the above-ground biomass in genotype i , treatment j  and replicate k. a, b and c are the regression coefficients of g, the genotypic effect, t, the treatment effect and g × t the interaction between genotype and treatment, and εijk is the residual.

cdna synthesis
the experimental design, from tissue sampling to library construction and sequencing, is described in figure  <dig>  shoot apices were collected from three trees from each genotype and treatment, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. two rna extractions of three apices from each tree were performed, as previously described by reid et al.  <cit> . rna samples were treated with turbo rnase-free dnase  and purified with the rneasy plant mini kit . rna concentration and quality were analysed with an agilent technologies  <dig> bioanalyser  and a nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . the three rna preparations per replicate and per condition , were pooled in equal proportions, providing templates for cdna libraries s1-s <dig> . full-length cdna was obtained from  <dig> μg of rna, with the smart cdna library construction kit , according to the manufacturer's instructions. we amplified the cdna with pcr advantage ii polymerase , over  <dig> cycles . this cdna amplification procedure was repeated eight times in separate tubes for each sample, with pooling to give a total of  <dig> μg of cdna fragments longer than  <dig>  bp quantified with an agilent technologies  <dig> bioanalyzer. eight cdna libraries  were constructed, giving two biological replicates for the two genotypes  subjected to the two watering regimes .

library construction, 454-sequencing, sequence quality control and assembly
we nebulised  <dig> μg of each cdna sample to a mean fragment size of  <dig> bp and ligated it to an adaptor, according to standard procedures  <cit> . each cdna library was tagged with multiplex identifiers  barcode adaptors, and two independent multiplexes were created by pooling one sample from each genotype and treatment. multiplex # <dig> comprised samples s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  whereas muliplex # <dig> comprised samples s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  one half-run  of sequencing was initially carried out for multiplex # <dig> on a gs-flx titanium platform  at cogenics . two half-runs of sequencing for multiplex # <dig>  and multiplex # <dig>  were then performed by agencourt  on a gs-flx titanium sequencer. base calling with gs-flx system software generated  <dig>  high-quality reads for the first half-run and in  <dig>  reads for the second complete run. sequences were deposited at the ncbi short-read archive  under accession number sra <dig>  . the 454-sequencing reads  were screened by cross_match  for primers and adaptors and then masked. for each 454-sequencing read, the longest non-masked region was extracted and further trimmed with seqclean . the shorter regions were discarded to eliminate potential chimeras. sequences were assembled as previously described  <cit> , with tgicl  <cit> , using the  <dig> sets of sequencing data from this study and the four sets of sequencing data obtained for e. grandis  by novaes et al.  <cit> . in parallel, all reads were stored in the ng <dig> system  and three kinds of analysis were performed for each of the  <dig> sequencing sets, as previously described  <cit> : i) blast search for e. coli, phage and yeast contaminants, ii) read quality analysis and iii) removal of sequences that were too long or too short, sequences with an excess of errors , low-complexity sequences and duplicated reads, using pyrocleaner program. only unigene elements  resulting from sequences generated in this experiment  were used for digital gene expression analysis.

digital gene expression analysis
contigs with less than  <dig> reads for the  <dig> sequencing sets generated in this study were eliminated from further statistical analyses. for the  <dig>  remaining contigs, the numbers of reads per sequencing set and per contig were used to assess gene abundance. two types of statistical analysis were performed. first, pairwise comparisons were carried out between genotypes  and between treatments . four additional comparisons were carried out for each genotype and each treatment, as follows: ir vs. ni for genotypes g <dig> and g <dig>  g <dig> vs. g <dig> for treatments ir and ni. statistical tests, based on the use of the mars method in the degseq package  <cit>  were performed to assess differential expression  <cit> . second, two-way analysis of variance  was performed on contigs, making use of the three replicates  per treatment to estimate random variation and test the genotype , treatment  and genotype-treatment interaction  effects. transcript abundance was normalized by dividing the number of reads by the sequence length of the contigs and the total number of sequences in each sequencing set. contigs with a q-value < <dig>  in the degseq test   <cit>  and with p-values < <dig>  after anova were considered to be differentially expressed and were extracted for further analysis. the  <dig>  genes analysed were classified into four classes: not significantly differentially expressed , and showing genotype , treatment  or genotype × treatment  effects. for the comparison of expression levels, we used log2-transformed fold-changes between contig abundances in the various contrasts obtained in the degseq analysis.

functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
contigs were assigned a putative function by blastx  <cit> , using various public databases: uniprotkb/swiss-prot , refseq protein , pfam , with an e-value cut-off value of 10e- <dig>  sequences were also compared to tigr's assemblies of arabidopsis_thaliana , helianthus_annuus , populus , picea  and vitis vinifera , with an e-value cut-off of 10e- <dig>  gene ontology terms were assigned via the uniprotkb accession and clustered with blast2go  <cit> . the differential distributions of each class of effect  between biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components were assessed using fisher's exact tests, with a significance threshold of  <dig> . pathway analysis was carried out with mapman  <cit> . differentially expressed contigs were assigned to functional categories  by mercator . a dedicated pathway map was created to represent most of these contigs. the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to identify differentially regulated bins.

RESULTS
monitoring of soil water content
a factorial design including two genotypes  and two water regimes  was established in a field trial in one of the main areas of eucalyptus plantation in the republic of congo. the experiment was evaluated over a period of two years. soil water content  was monitored throughout the experiment at six depths , to assess water availability in different experimental conditions. in this study, we focus on the effect of water availability in the second dry season  on biomass production and the transcriptome.

in the ni treatment, swc varied from  <dig> % to 8%, and no significant difference was found between the two genotypes . swc values were close to wilting point , i.e., when plants ceased to be able to absorb soil water. in the ir treatment, swc ranged from 11% to 17%, and exceeded field capacity , indicating that water was not a limiting factor for tree growth. swc was also higher in the area surrounding genotype g <dig> than in genotype g <dig>  except at two depths . this result suggests that the two genotypes absorb water preferentially from different depths, possibly because their root system develops differently.

effect of water deficit on biomass production
genotype  and treatment  had significant effects on above-ground biomass production  . mean biomass was much higher for genotype g <dig>  than for genotype g <dig>  confirming earlier findings  <cit> . not surprisingly, mean biomass was higher for the ir treatment  than for the ni treatment . a two-way anova showed that the gxt interaction effect was not significant , but relative biomass loss was nonetheless lower for genotype g <dig>  than for genotype g <dig> . these results suggest that the growth of genotype g <dig> is less affected by water shortage compared to g <dig> 

sequencing of the eucalyptus shoot apex transcriptome
we chose to sequence the shoot apex transcriptome to study the molecular response of eucalyptus to water deficit, due to its role in shoot organogenesis  <cit> . shoot apices were pooled from three trees in four sets of conditions . three half-runs  of 454-roche flx titanium sequencing provided  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   reads, for a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences . the mean read length was  <dig> bp for run a,  <dig> bp for run b and  <dig> bp for run c . reads were slightly shorter for run a, with a higher abundance of reads comprised between 400- <dig> bp in length, whereas runs b and c were characterised by reads of 460- <dig> bp in length . to increase contig length of the assembly, we combined all the reads  generated in this study  with other gs- <dig> and gs-flx  <dig> reads  from various organs of e. grandis . figure  <dig> summarises the various stages in sequence analysis, corresponding to data quality control, read assembly, annotation and abundance analysis. after removal of vector and adaptor sequences,  <dig> , <dig> reads were available for assembly. assembly with tgicl generated  <dig>  unigene elements  comprising  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. removal of low-quality sequences and duplicated reads with the ng <dig> platform resulted in a total of  <dig>  ue , from which  <dig>  ue  were identified in the e. spp sequencing set  and used for digital gene expression analysis .

contribution of the three half-run replicates
in total,  <dig>  ue  did not have sequence similarity to the e. grandis sequence reads from novaes et al.  <cit> . most of these sequences were singletons , although some were contigs , corresponding to 27% of the e. spp contigs. a blast homology search  of published eucalyptus databases  showed that  <dig>  ue  did not match any known sequence. thus, the resource described here greatly extends the list of genes known to be expressed in eucalyptus, which will be critical for the annotation of the genome sequence. due to the smaller number of reads in run a, the total number of ue including reads generated from run a was also smaller  than that generated from the other two runs . each supplementary half-run produced between  <dig> and 21% new contigs for a second half-run, and between  <dig> and 7% for a third half-run . vega-arreguin et al.  <cit>  reported similar trends in maize, with a plateau of gene representation reached after the third successive gs- <dig> 454-sequencing run. the number of reads generated was therefore considered sufficient to sample most expressed genes.

the pearson's correlation coefficients  obtained for read frequencies in the  <dig> sequencing sets from e. spp  and the four sequencing sets from e. grandis  were similar. however, the mean correlation was much weaker  between the e. spp and e. grandis sequencing sets, suggesting that different fractions of the transcriptome had been sampled from these two studies and/or that gene expression differed between both sequencing sets. as expected, correlations were stronger between replicates  than between different samples  in e. spp sequencing sets, suggesting a high level of technical repeatability.

within conditions, correlations between the g <dig> and g <dig> sequencing sets were robust and similar between treatments: 90% for the ir treatment and 88% for the ni treatment, suggesting that these two genotypes displayed similar patterns of gene expression when placed in the same environmental conditions. correlations between the ir and ni sequencing sets were slightly weaker and a stronger contrast was observed within genotypes: on average, 86% for genotype g <dig> and 82% for genotype g <dig>  the weaker correlations obtained for g <dig> suggest that this genotype had a more pronounced response to water deficit than genotype g <dig> 

homology search
blast search  results are summarised in table  <dig>  a functional annotation was obtained more frequently for contigs - 70% of the contigs harboured similarity to sequences in protein databases, and 75% to sequences in nucleic acid databases. in contrast, for singletons only 39% and 9% of the contigs had similarity to protein and nucleic acid sequences, respectively. these differences were expected, given the longer mean length of the contigs  compared to singletons , their lower abundance and the fact that singletons are more likely to be sequencing artefacts. a larger number of nucleic acid sequences had similarity to arabidopsis , followed by vitis , and populus . the greater similarity to arabidopsis genes may be due to the closer phylogenetic relationship of eucalyptus to arabidopsis  than to populus . the arabidopsis genome has also been annotated in greater detailed than the populus genome. interestingly, the similar characteristics of eucalyptus and poplar in terms of growth habits do not translated into higher similarity of the sequences transcribed.

% of sequences related to e. spp. libraries is shown in brackets.

according to gene ontology  classification,  <dig>  ue  were associated with at least one biological process , molecular function  or cellular component . the proportions of ue annotated in each category were generally similar to those obtained in arabidopsis , suggesting that the e.spp sequencing sets are appropriate for the analysis of gene expression on a broad range of functional categories.

transcript abundance analysis
after removing contigs represented by fewer than  <dig> reads in all the e.spp sequencing sets,  <dig>  contigs remained for abundance analysis. two statistical tests were performed in series to detect differences in the expression levels of these  <dig>  contigs, among the four experimental conditions . first, a deg-seq test  <cit>  identified  <dig>  differentially expressed contigs . a two-way anova was then performed to assess the effects of the two main factors  and their interaction  on the number of reads per contig. this analysis identified  <dig>  contigs with at least one significant effect . with an error rate of 5%, only  <dig> false positives are expected among the  <dig>  contigs.

most of the differentially expressed contigs  showed a genotype effect , with  <dig> "g contigs" overexpressed in genotype g <dig>  vs.  <dig> "g contigs" underexpressed in g <dig> . of the  <dig> contigs overexpressed in genotype g <dig>   <dig>  were expressed only in that genotype  whereas only  <dig> contigs  showed the reverse trend, suggesting that g <dig> may express of a larger set of genes or different splicing variants.

a total of  <dig> contigs showing a treatment effect  were identified with similar numbers overexpressed in the two treatments . thirteen "t contigs" were expressed only in ni conditions, whereas all the "t contigs" overexpressed in ir conditions were also found in ni sequencing sets, suggesting that few "specific genes" are upregulated in response to water deficit but that the set of genes expressed in favourable conditions is also expressed at a lower level in stressed plants.

finally,  <dig> contigs corresponded to "gxt" contigs. the larger number of "gxt" contigs than of "t contigs" suggests that some of the observed molecular plasticity is under genetic control. only  <dig> "gxt contigs" displayed significant differential expression between the ir and ni conditions in genotype g <dig> , whereas  <dig> "gxt contigs" displayed such behaviour in genotype g <dig> , suggesting a more pronounced response in g <dig>  similarly,  <dig> "gxt contigs" were differentially expressed between the two genotypes in ir conditions , whereas  <dig> "gxt contigs" were differentially expressed between the two genotypes for the ni treatment . these results suggest that, despite the rather similar expression patterns for the two genotypes in ir conditions, water deficit induced a molecular response specific to each genotype, reflecting different strategies to respond to water shortage during the dry season.

blast2go functional analysis
gene ontology  analysis was performed on  <dig>  contigs . these contigs were assigned to biological processes , with  <dig> main subcategories , cellular compartments , with five main subcategories , and molecular functions , with eight main subcategories . consistent with the number of annotations per category , two subcategories were found to be strongly represented: > 65% of the contigs were assigned to cellular and metabolic processes for bp, more than 40% were assigned to cells and 85% to organelles for cc, and > 40% were assigned to binding and catalytic activity for mf. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of contigs between these subcategories as a function of the four classes of effects . the homogeneity of the relative abundance of contigs between the "significant" classes  and the "not significant" class  in each go category was assessed with fisher's exact tests. in bp, "g" contigs were overrepresented in four subcategories . "t" contigs were overrepresented in only one subcategory . finally, "gxt" contigs were overrepresented in three subcategories . these differences in relative abundance suggest that genes related to defence reactions are the main contributors to differences between significant and "ns" contigs. for cc, only one subcategory  presented a higher relative abundance for all three significant effects. for mf, "g" contigs were overrepresented in two subcategories , whereas "t" contigs were overrepresented in only one subcategory ; for "gxt" contigs, two other subcategories  presented higher relative abundances than "ns".

analysis of metabolic pathways with mapman
of the  <dig>  contigs displaying significant differential expression, the  <dig>  "g contigs" did not enable characterisation of specific molecular processes . for 95% of these contigs, many different genes from different molecular processes were activated, depending on the experimental condition . in some instances , some bins presented specific overexpression in one genotype . for example, contigs related to ethylene biosynthesis and cell organisation were overexpressed mainly in genotype g <dig>  whereas contigs related to photosynthesis, nitrilases, calcium signalling and pathogenesis-related protein bins were overexpressed in genotype g <dig>  serine proteases  were expressed more strongly in genotype g <dig> , whereas ubiquitin e3-encoding proteins  were expressed more strongly in genotype g <dig> , suggesting that proteolysis occurred via different pathways in the two genotypes.

analysis of the metabolic pathways for "t" contigs was limited because of the small number of contigs , which were distributed in several bins . however, the expression of genes related to carbohydrate degradation and ethylene biosynthesis were found to be stronger for the ni treatment, whereas the expression of genes related to ribosomal protein synthesis and cell development appeared to be stronger for the ir treatment .

different patterns were observed for "gxt" contigs : i) some pathways  displayed similar patterns in the two genotypes, but with responses of different magnitudes . photosystem components tended to be overrepresented in genotype g <dig> in the ir condition, whereas few differences were observed between conditions for genotype g <dig>  conversely, genes related to cell organisation and pr-proteins were more likely to be overexpressed in the ni condition in genotype g <dig> compared to genotype g <dig>  ii) interestingly, most of the pathways  displayed opposite trends in the two genotypes . for example, in the ni treatment, genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, auxin biosynthesis, heat stress, and light signalling were overexpressed in genotype g <dig>  while they where underexpressed in genotype g <dig>  conversely, genes related to global primary metabolism  and receptor kinases were overexpressed in genotype g <dig>  but underexpressed in genotype g <dig> in the ni condition . this result strongly suggests that different metabolic pathways and genes were activated in these two genotypes in response to water shortage. thus, these two genotypes exhibit different molecular strategies to cope with water deficit during the dry season.

discussion
gene discovery and expression analysis by ngs
next-generation sequencing  technologies are becoming the method of choice for large-scale transcriptome analysis, even for non-model species . several technologies have been developed, differing essentially in the number of reads generated and read length , making it possible to catalogue the genes expressed and to monitor gene expression.

in eucalyptus, mizrachi et al.  <cit>  generated  <dig>  gbp of short reads  with sequencing-by-synthesis technology from illumina, and assembled this information de novo into  <dig>  contigs  longer than  <dig> bp . in this study, we obtained  <dig>  gbp of sequences with longer reads , which were assembled into  <dig>  contigs  with more than  <dig> bp each . we were thus able to assemble more reads, i.e.  <dig> % of the sequencing set, that is a much higher rate than the  <dig> % reported by mizrachi et al.  <cit> . blast searches for sequence similarities between the two datasets showed that 86% of the contigs were common to both studies . however, each illumina contig matched a mean of five 454-sequencing contigs, indicating that ue detected with our approach were probably confounded in the short-read assembly. in addition, the short illumina contigs may represent domains shared by multiple proteins, confirming the difficulty involved in assembling short reads into transcriptional units  <cit> . alternatively we can not rule out the fact that genes were split in multiple contigs in the  <dig> assembly because of the lack of coverage compared to illumina's short reads. finally, we found that  <dig>  454-ue did not match any previously described eucalyptus ests, and that 43% of these ue  displayed no match with any nucleic acid or protein sequence published for any other species. therefore, our 454-sequencing data considerably enriched the eucalyptus est collection.

rna-seq is also an interesting approach to obtain a comprehensive digital gene expression profile for specific tissues, cell types or developmental processes. in this study, the high degree of repeatability observed for the three replicates made it possible to test g, t and gxt effects with a statistical support. we were able to monitor the expression of  <dig>  ue and to identify  <dig>  ue displaying at least one significant effect. some technical biases, such as non-linear amplification and a lack of sequencing depth may have resulted in a lack of precision in the prediction of gene expression by 454-sequencing . short read-based sequencing approaches provide ample read coverage and generally give better predictions of gene expression  <cit> . thus, a combination of long and short reads may be seen as a reasonable strategy for the analysis of gene expression  <cit> . with this combined strategy, long-read sequencing can be used to establish a comprehensive catalogue of transcriptional units, while short reads mapped onto this assembly provide greater sequencing depth, improving predictions of abundance.

behaviour of variance components at the phenotypic and molecular levels
we observed that phenotypic and molecular variation are accounted for principally by genotypic differences. indeed, above-ground biomass and contig abundance were influenced principally by genotype. above-ground biomass was, on average, 49% higher for g <dig> than for g <dig>  and most of the differentially expressed contigs  in this study presented a genotypic effect. the number of contigs overexpressed in one or the other of the genotypes was similar -  <dig> and  <dig> contigs were overexpressed in g <dig> and g <dig>  respectively. no particular genotypic signature in terms of functional categories or pathways was detected. the two genotypes differed strongly in phenotype , but it remains unclear whether these differences in transcript abundance were responsible for trait variation, neutral, or simply involved in reproductive isolation between parental species. indeed, differences in gene expression between species have been reported in the field of ecological genomics  <cit>  and interpreted as a mechanism of speciation. in our study, both genotypes were hybrid combinations between different species. this may have increased the number of differences between their transcriptomes. further investigations about the role of gene expression in ecological speciation is an important question, particularly for eucalyptus, in which species complexes are common  <cit> .

the variance accounted for by genotype-by-environment interaction  at the phenotypic and molecular level was also significant in this study. the ni treatment resulted in a significantly lower above-ground biomass, and this difference was greater for the least productive of the two genotypes, g <dig> , than for g <dig> . the g and t effects accounted for 56% and 13% of the above-ground biomass variation, respectively, whereas gxt effects accounted for only  <dig> % of the variance. at the molecular level, we also found a higher proportion of genes displaying g effects  but, surprisingly, we found fewer genes displaying t effects  than gxt effects .

while only  <dig> contigs were differentially expressed between the two treatments in genotype g <dig>   <dig> contigs showed differential expression in genotype g <dig> . moreover, when the whole e. spp sequencing set was screened, genotype g <dig> presented a larger number of specific contigs  than g <dig> . these results suggest that a larger set of genes is activated in genotype g <dig>  leading to the triggering of specific responses to water deficit. this higher molecular sensitivity of genotype g <dig> may confer advantages ultimately resulting in a greater capacity to cope with water deficit during the dry season and, therefore, in stronger growth capacity .

abbreviations: +/- means that in a given category more than 50% of the genes are over/underexpressed in ni.++/-- means that in a given category more than 50% of the genes are over/underexpressed in ni with a log2-tranformed fold change <- <dig>  or > <dig> .

genes displaying gei effects reflect differences in signal perception and response strategy
contigs displaying gei effects could be classified into two groups according to the function of the proteins encoded  <cit> : i) regulatory proteins responsible for drought signal transduction and response triggering, and ii) functional proteins involved in cell protection, damage repair and the maintenance of cell activity.

regarding regulatory functions, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of hormones, such as ethylene and auxins in particular  were mostly overexpressed in genotype g <dig> and underexpressed in g <dig>  in the ni condition. genes acting as second messengers in the transduction of hormonal signal to stomatal guard cells  <cit>  also displayed gei effects: in the ni condition, genes involved in calcium signalling were predominantly overexpressed in g <dig>  whereas the response of g <dig> to drought preferentially involved receptor kinases. we also identified other signal transducers, such as light-induced proteins and heat-shock proteins, which may be related to other types of stress induced by water deficit, including osmotic stress due to ph variations and oxidative stress due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . these pathways were mostly overexpressed in g <dig> and underexpressed in g <dig> during the dry season. pathogenesis-related  protein genes were overexpressed in g <dig>  but displayed a less clear-cut pattern of expression in g <dig>  pr proteins were initially reported to be induced by hormones or ros in response to biotic stress  <cit> , but they have also been shown to be involved in other abiotic stresses  <cit> . lee et al.  <cit>  also suggested that pr proteins may be used as storage proteins when growth is limited by environmental factors. some transcription factors responded strongly to water shortage in genotype g <dig>  two, in particular, encoded factors homologous to atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  which have been shown to regulate secondary metabolism  in arabidopsis  <cit> . these results suggest that water shortage induces different cellular stress cascades, perceived differently by the two genotypes.

stress signal transducers interact to trigger the regulation of gene expression for the maintenance of three main functions: cell protection, damage repair and the maintenance of cell activity. our results suggest that more genes related to cell protection were involved in the response to water shortage in genotype g <dig> than in genotype g <dig>  protection against drought stress seems to involve mostly carbohydrates, with  <dig> contigs displaying gei effects, and, to a lesser extent, polyamines, which may modulate some ion channels  <cit> .

by contrast to the trends observed for genes related to cell protection, more genes related to damage repair seem to be expressed during the dry season in genotype g <dig> than in genotype g <dig>  particularly those related to cell organisation. the overexpression, during ni treatment, of genes related to primary metabolism, including carbohydrate, lipid and protein synthesis and degradation, suggests that resources are reallocated for the repair of cell structures or the formation of new structures in drought stressed plants. the patterns of expression of secondary metabolism genes differed between the two genotypes as well. as an example, g <dig> displayed a higher number of genes related to terpenoids and flavonoids synthesis  overexpressed in the ni treatment compared to genotype g <dig>  however, the contrasts between nir and ir treatments were much higher for g <dig>  conversely, genes related to lignin biosynthesis  were overexpressed in the ir condition only for g <dig> 

gene related to photosynthesis were found to be under-expressed in g <dig> subjected to ni treatment, whereas no variation was found in g <dig>  other metabolic processes, such cell development and transport, controlled by genes encoding water or sugar channels, decreased in ni treatment, particularly in g <dig>  these results confirm the trends observed by alexandersson et al.  <cit>  in arabidopsis. these authors studied the expression of  <dig> genes encoding aquaporins and showed that most of these genes were downregulated in leaves subjected to a gradual water deficit. interestingly, cell activity seemed to be more reduced at the transcriptional level for g <dig>  although this genotype grew more strongly. it is possible that, during water deficit, genotype g <dig> reduces its rate of photosynthesis and reallocates resources  to preserve its cell structures and ability to resume growth when conditions become more favourable.

evolutionary implication behind gei
we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> contigs displaying a gxt effect were absent from the g <dig> sequencing set , whereas only two such contigs were absent in g <dig> . unfortunately, of  <dig> contigs absent in g <dig>   <dig> could not been assigned to a homolog gene in arabidopsis. the others corresponded to genes related to cell organisation , ethylene synthesis, protein metabolism, pr proteins and receptor kinases. these genes may be considered non-essential for tree development, and are therefore unlikely to be subject to selection constraints. landry et al.  <cit>  found an overrepresentation of non-essential genes  among genes displaying gei in saccharomyces cerevisiae. they proposed two hypotheses to account for the activity of these genes being compensated in cells: i) metabolic buffering: non-coded metabolites may be rerouted through the metabolic network, and ii) genetic buffering: paralogous genes may supply the missing function. we showed in the results section  that differences between genotypes may be accounted for by the preferential expression of different members or splicing forms of genes from the same family. this observation may confirm the hypothesis of genetic buffering.

scale plasticity was observed for  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially expressed contigs: genotype ranks were conserved between treatments but one genotype reacted more or less strongly to the environmental variation. conversely,  <dig> contigs showed a change in ranking between genotypes . landry et al.  <cit>  hypothesised that these two types of gei would have different effects on the evolution of plastic traits. in the case of scale plasticity, whatever the environment, selection would result in the same favoured genotype, whereas in the case of rank plasticity, different genotypes would be selected in different environments. in the present study, we found differentially expressed genes presenting both scale plasticity  and rank plasticity , indicating different types of reaction norms on which natural selection would act on.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool for transcriptome screening: with  <dig> mb of sequence, we were able to assemble ests into  <dig>  contigs, with remaining  <dig>  singletons, and to determine the relative abundance of  <dig>  contigs each comprising more than  <dig> reads. large differences between genotypes, in terms of phenotypic behaviour and transcriptome regulation, were observable. differences in gene expression between the two genotypes appear to affect the whole transcriptome, rather than specific pathways. the genotype-specific response to water shortage  was more pronounced than the response common to both genotypes . the genes displaying genetically controlled plasticity were found to belong to a number of different pathways essentially related to signal transduction and primary metabolism. the more productive genotype, g <dig>  express a larger set of genes, leading to the triggering of specific molecular responses. moreover, gxt interaction results principally from a lack of molecular response in genotype g <dig>  together with a strong response of genotype g <dig> . the ability to regulate more actively its transcriptome might be a key component in the maintenance of biomass in water deficit conditions.

finally, although this study provides clues to the way in which different genotypes activate their transcriptomes when subjected to water deficit, more research is required to understand the molecular mechanisms involved during the dry season. first, there is a need to characterize reaction norm in a broader genetic background  <cit> . second, epigenetics or post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms that are well known to interfere with abiotic stress responses  <cit>  deserve specific investigations.
