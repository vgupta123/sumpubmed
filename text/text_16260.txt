BACKGROUND
there are countless ways in which prokaryotes influence our daily life. for example, they mediate the chemical cycles that convert key elements of life into biologically accessible forms; they make certain nutrients/metals/vitamins available to their biological hosts; and they can also be used to breakdown hydrocarbons and treat crude oil leakages. on the other hand, the environment has undoubtedly left footprints on the morphological, physiological and biochemical diversities of prokaryotes during the evolution. the close interactions between prokaryotes and the environment, especially driven by horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination, have made prokaryotes the most genetically diverse superkingdoms of life  <cit> .

temperature is one of the elements characterizing the ecological contexts of prokaryotic organisms. the national center for biotechnology information  microbial genome project database  uses five terms to categorize the temperature range an organism grows at, where cryophilic refers to -30° to -2°c, psychrophilic refers to -1° to +10°c, mesophilic refers to +11° to +45°c, thermophilic refers to + <dig> to +75°c, hyperthermophilic refers to above +75°c, and organisms that live at ranges that overlap with more than one category are labeled as the one corresponding to the largest overlap. it has been reported that temperature can possibly influence the ecological, physiological and genomic properties of a prokaryotic organism in multiple aspects. for instance, at the population-level, temperature was shown to have caused compositional and functional shifts in microbial communities  <cit> ; at the cellular level, temperature was shown to have a significant effect on a variety of growth parameters   <cit> , structure and ion permeability of cell membranes  <cit> , affinity for substrates   <cit> , circadian rhythms  <cit> , and virulence functions  <cit> ; and, at the molecular level, temperature was shown to be correlated with the nucleotide content, codon usage and amino acid composition  <cit> , structure/function/stability of proteins  <cit> , topological properties of metabolic networks  <cit> , expression of certain genes   <cit> , etc.

guanine-cytosine  content is one of the genomic traits that have been hypothesized to be correlated with the temperature condition of an organism. since the gc pair is bound by three hydrogen bonds while the adenine-thymine  pair is bound by two hydrogen bonds, it has long been expected that organisms growing at higher temperature would have a higher proportion of gc than at pairs. however, it remains ambiguous whether the whole-genome gc content level of an organism is correlated with its temperature condition. analysis on  <dig> bacterial species seemed to have confirmed the existence of the positive correlation between the whole-genome gc content level and the optimal growth temperature of prokaryotes  <cit> . however, later analysis indicated that the sample size, presence of outliers, as well as some other factors that may affect whole-genome gc content levels  could potentially introduce bias towards the association analysis and lead to questionable conclusions  <cit> . actually, organisms living at high temperature have mechanisms other than increasing gc content, such as thermophile-specific enzymes   <cit>  or certain dinucleotides that may contribute to thermostability  <cit> , to maintain the double stranded structure of the dna.

it is worthy of notice that the gc content can be substantially variable within the same genome. for instance, the gc content in coding regions is often higher than that of the whole genome  <cit> . and, if a dna fragment is obtained via a recent horizontal gene transfer event, its gc content tends to exhibit different variation patterns from the native parts of the genome. despite the lack of obvious correlation between the whole-genome gc content level and the optimal growth temperature, studies have shown that the gc content levels of certain genes  are significantly correlated with the optimal growth temperatures  <cit> . also, as shown in fig.  <dig>  the non-coding region surrounding the gene menb  can be drastically different for mesophilic and thermophilic/hyperthermophilic organisms. inspired by these preliminary investigations, we here focus on the correlation relationships between the genic gc content levels and the temperature range conditions of prokaryotic organisms.

data sets
genomes
among the  <dig> complete prokaryotic genomes available from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  ,  <dig> genomes are accompanied with characterizations of temperature range conditions in ncbi’s microbial genome project database . the temperature range of a prokaryotic organism is characterized by one of the five terms – cryophilic, psychrophilic, mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic; however, the organisms are unevenly distributed under these five temperature range conditions, with the majority falling into the category mesophilic . to maximally take advantage of the provided information regarding organisms’ temperature range conditions as well as to obtain statistically significant results, we excluded the cryophilic and psychrophilic categories from further analysis, merged  <dig> thermophilic and  <dig> hyperthermophilic organisms into the same category , and then focused on the  <dig> mesophilic versus  <dig> thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms.

genic gc content
among the  <dig> , <dig> genes of the  <dig> organisms being studied,  <dig> , <dig>  genes are assigned with kegg orthology  ids, and a total number of  <dig>  ko groups are being covered. we considered genes with the same ko ids as orthologous, so that they can be used to estimate the distribution of the gc content level surrounding each gene  in various genomes. for each gene, we obtained the gc content levels of both the coding and surrounding non-coding regions, where the non-coding region starts from the end of the previous gene till the start of the next gene with the coding region of the current gene being excluded. as the coding and non-coding regions were treated independently, we used genomic region to refer to either of them in the rest of the paper.

methods
our association analysis consisted of two steps – statistical tests and prediction tests. the kolmogorov-smirnov  statistical tests were first carried out to identify those genomic regions of which the distribution patterns of the gc content levels are different for organisms of different temperature range conditions but are irrelevant to the phylogenetic distribution of the organisms or the distribution of other environmental factors. the support vector machine -based prediction tests were then carried out to determine whether the temperature range condition of a prokaryotic organism can be inferred from the gc content levels of the genomic regions selected via the statistical tests.

statistical tests
ks tests on the complete list of organisms
the gc content estimates for each genomic region can be organized into two groups – one consisting of those obtained from the  <dig> mesophilic organisms and the other consisting of those obtained from the  <dig> thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms. the ks test was conducted to determine whether these gc content levels are distributed differently for these two groups of organisms of different temperature range conditions. specifically, the gc content of a genomic region was considered as potentially correlated with the temperature range condition if its corresponding p-value was less than  <dig> . in order to increase the stability of the identified correlation relationships, we also adopted the bootstrap strategy  <cit>  to repeatedly perform the ks test on 90% of the randomly selected mesophilic organisms versus all the thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms for  <dig> iterations. those genomic regions that were consistently selected in all the  <dig> ks tests, denoted as {gcomplete}, were then taken for further analysis.

ks tests on partial lists of organisms with each individual phylum being excluded in turn
the distribution of the mesophilic organisms in various phylogenetic groups are different from that of the thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms. observe from fig.  <dig> that mesophilic organisms mainly fall into the proteobacteria, firmicutes and actinobacteria phyla; whereas, thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms mainly fall into the crenarchaeota, firmicutes and euryarchaeota phyla. this may prompt one to ask whether the difference in the phylogenetic distributions of these organisms also contributes to the difference in the distributions of the gc content levels of the genomic regions in {gcomplete}.

to examine whether the distribution of the gc content level is correlated with the phylogenetic origin of an organism and whether the temperature range condition and the phylogenetic origin are coupled in being correlated with the distribution of gc content levels, we should ideally perform the multi-variate anova  <cit>  or chi-square test  <cit> . however, the multi-variate anova assumes that all sample populations under different conditions are normally distributed and have equal variance, which is not necessarily satisfied for our small data set. the chi-square test requires that predictor variables are categorical, which is not satisfied in our case since the predictor variable, the gc content level, is continuous. we therefore turned to the approach of leaving an individual phylum out and performing the ks test on the remaining organisms. the ks test on the partial list of organisms was performed  <dig> times with one phylum being excluded for each time. the genomic regions in {gcomplete} that were also selected when a phylum was excluded, {g–phylum}, can be viewed as correlated with the temperature range condition but irrelevant to the distribution of the phylum being excluded. and, the genomic regions that were shared by all {g–phylum}’s can then be viewed as correlated with the temperature range condition but irrelevant to the distribution in any phylum.

ks tests on partial lists of organisms with particular oxygen requirement, habitat or salinity conditions being excluded
various physiological features, including the gram stain, shape, arrangement, endospores, motility, salinity, oxygen requirement, habitat, organisms that the prokaryote is pathogenic in, and the related disease, are together with the temperature range conditions provided in ncbi’s microbial genome project database for each prokaryotic genome. besides the temperature range condition, we were also interested in the features regarding the salinity, oxygen requirement, and habitat, because  these features characterize the basic environment that an organism prefers to or has been found to live in, and  these features can be specified by using controlled vocabularies.

observe from table  <dig> that the distribution of the mesophilic organisms under various oxygen requirement, habitat and salinity conditions is different than that of the thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms. to investigate the possible interactions among different environmental factors in their being correlated with the gc content levels, we adopted similar strategy as for the phylogenetic factors, i.e., to exclude organisms of a particular oxygen requirement/salinity/habitat condition and then conduct the ks tests on the remaining organisms. this procedure was repeated for all the oxygen requirement, salinity, and habitat conditions. the genomic regions in {gcomplete} that were also selected when a particular environmental condition was excluded is denoted as , and can be considered as correlated with the temperature range condition but irrelevant to the distribution in the environmental condition being excluded. and, the genomic regions that are shared by all ’s can then be considered as correlated with the temperature range condition but irrelevant to the distribution in any of the other three environmental factors being considered.

statistical tests on the genomes online database 
the reported association analysis on the genomic and environmental traits might be prone to the annotation errors at both the genomic and environmental sides. at the genomic side, since the annotations in the kegg database involve both computation-based and manual curation  <cit> , our estimates for the gc content levels in the coding/non-coding regions based on the ko annotations can be trusted. at the environmental side, however, there may exist errors in the ncbi’s microbial genome project database. for instance, it has been shown that the oxygen requirement annotations and/or habitat annotations of some prokaryotic organisms are problematic  <cit> . to examine to what extent the error in the environmental annotations may have affected our association analysis, we used the environmental annotations provided by the genomes online database   <cit>  and performed similar statistical tests. the gold database characterizes the ecological context of each organisms in  <dig> aspects, including the temperature range, oxygen requirement, salinity and habitat conditions. however, these two databases are not always consistent. for instance, the salinity condition of the species rhodobacter sphaeroides kd <dig> is annotated as halophilic in the gold database but non-halophilic in the ncbi’s microbial genome project database; and the habitat condition of the species candidatus methanoregula boonei is annotated as fresh water in the gold database but terrestrial in the ncbi’s microbial genome project database. a systematic comparison of the environmental annotations of the two databases revealed that ~ <dig> % of the organisms have different temperature range annotations, ~ <dig> % of the organisms have different oxygen requirement annotations , and for the salinity and habitat conditions different vocabularies are adopted. by using the environmental annotations in the gold database, we performed all the above-mentioned ks tests, including those based on the complete list of the genomes as well as those based on the partial lists of the genomes with certain phylogenetic/oxygen requirement/habitat/salinity categories being excluded.

prediction tests
from the statistical point of view, the significance of the correlation relationships between the temperature range condition and the gc content levels of the selected genomic regions can be measured by the p-values derived from the ks tests. on the other hand, if the temperature range condition of an organism is predictable based on the gc content levels in the selected genomic regions, then the correlation relationships between the two traits can be further justified.

for the prediction test, each organism was represented by a feature vector consisting of the gc content levels of the selected genomic regions. a cross validation procedure  <cit>  was applied to estimate the prediction accuracy. that is, the collection of the mesophilic genomes and the collection of the thermo/hyperthermo-philic genomes were each randomly partitioned into two portions. the portions with 10% of the genomes from both collections were used for testing to estimate the classification accuracy, while the other portions with 90% of the genomes were used for building a svm-based classifier. this partition-training-and-testing procedure was repeated for  <dig> times to obtain the average prediction accuracy. the estimate for the prediction accuracy was benchmarked against the prediction accuracy rendered by random guessing. to facilitate such comparisons, we enforced that for each cross validation experiment the same number of organisms  for both temperature range conditions were used so that the accuracy rate rendered by random guessing is 50%. note that the  <dig> repeats of the cross validation procedure could allow us to sample a variety of combinations of mesophilic organisms so that the estimate of the prediction accuracy was unbiased to particular sub-collections of mesophilic organisms.

to test the generalizability of the identified correlation relationships, we also applied the svm-based classifier to predicting the temperature range conditions of  <dig> mesophilic and  <dig> thermo/hyperthermo-philic in-progress genomes in ncbi’s microbial genome project database , as well as  <dig> mesophilic and  <dig> thermo/hyperthermo-philic metagenomes in the integrated microbial genomes  system  <cit>  . the prediction accuracy for these in-progress genomes and metagenomes was averaged cross the  <dig> svm classifiers, each of which was derived from the training phase of the above-mentioned cross validation procedure.

RESULTS
we here discuss the results of the statistical and prediction tests.

genes selected based on the complete list of organisms, {gcomplete}
a collection of  <dig> genomic regions  were consistently detected in all the  <dig> bootstrap ks tests and were included into {gcomplete}. to find out the biological implications underlying these  <dig> genomic regions, we performed enrichment analysis to determine which kegg pathways are over-represented by the pertinent genes of these genomic regions. the enrichment factor of a kegg pathway is defined as the ratio of the percentage of the genes involved in this pathway among the genes in {gcomplete} to the percentage of the genes involved in the same pathway among all the genes being considered. and, a kegg pathway was considered to be enriched if its enrichment factor is greater than  <dig>  here we summarize the kegg pathways with the  <dig> largest enrichment factors in table  <dig> 

it can been seem from table  <dig> that one of the most enriched kegg pathways is cell motility. it has been reported that the temperature affects bacterial movements in both chemotaxis  and flagellar assembly . for instance, flagella synthesis in escherichia coli, proteus sp. and salmonella sp. are all inhibited at higher incubation temperature  <cit> . and, as for chemotaxis behavior, most motors of a motile bacterial cell spin exclusively clockwise at very low temperatures so that the cell tumbles more frequently; and, when the environment temperature is incremented, the cell usually show some increase in average translational velocity  <cit> . note that styrene degradation , ubiquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis , and streptomycin biosynthesis  are also among the top  <dig> enriched kegg pathways, suggesting that these pathways are also subject to thermal influence. in accordance with these computation-based findings are the following biological experiment-based findings that are documented in various publications:  an increase of the temperature from 32°c to 40°c effectively decreases the styrene degradation rate of rhodococcus pyridinovorans pyj- <dig> to ~66% of the optimum value  <cit> .  ubiquinone- <dig> formation in escherichia colik- <dig> strain ab  <dig> was greatly affected by temperature variations – the rate of converting 2-octaprenyl phenol to ubiquinone- <dig> reached the maximum at 32°c, while virtually no reaction at all occurred at a temperature of 0°c  <cit> . and,  production of streptomycin in streptomyces griseus atcc  <dig> was suppressed at elevated growth temperature, and even failed at 34°c or above  <cit> . these findings demonstrated that our computation-based analysis on the correlation between genomic and ecological traits may guide experimental investigations on the mechanisms of prokaryotic organisms adapting to environmental changes.

when based on the gc content levels of the genomic regions in {gcomplete}, the prediction accuracy, averaged over the  <dig> cross-validation experiments, was  <dig> % for the complete genomes, and was  <dig> % for the in-progress genomes. note that both of the accuracy rates were significantly higher than the 50% accuracy yielded by random guessing.

genomic regions shared by all experiments on the partial lists of organisms
there were four genomic regions in {gcomplete} consistently selected during all the ks tests on the partial lists of organisms with particular phylogenetic/oxygen requirement/habitat/salinity categories being excluded. table  <dig> summarizes the mean and standard deviation of the gc content level in each of these four genomic regions for mesophilic as well as thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms. observe that the gc content levels in these four regions tend to be higher in mesophilic than thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms, which confirms the hypothesis that prokaryotic organisms living in high temperature range conditions do not necessarily rely on high gc contents to cope with their environment  <cit> .

these four genomic regions correspond to the coding regions of k <dig> , k <dig> , k <dig> , and k <dig> , and are interpreted as temperature-correlated but irrelevant to the distribution in various oxygen requirement, salinity, habitat and phylogenetic groups. some of these computation-based findings can be further supported by experiment-based findings. for instance, k <dig> reflects a common adaptation mechanism at high temperatures, because all the residues forming the network of aromatic and hydrophobic contacts and the residues potentially involved in cofactor binding are fairly well conserved among the hyperthermophilic but not in the mesophilic organisms  <cit> . hyperthermophilic organisms may require dna damage repair  to be unusually effective to cope with the destabilization of the dna at high temperatures  <cit> . and, micro-array experiments on the escherichia coli strains  that had been entrained in the high temperature conditions  also showed that the expressions of k <dig>  and k <dig>  were significantly different than those of the wild strain that lives at 37°c degrees  <cit> .

the phylogenetic trees of these four genes were built by using clustalw <dig>  <cit>  and phylip  <cit> , and are shown in the supplementary material. based on these trees, we calculated the evolutionary distances between organisms of the same temperature range  and the evolutionary distances between organisms of different temperature range conditions . on average, the inter-temperature distances are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> ; and, the intra-temperature distances are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  respectively. therefore, in terms of the evolutionary trajectories of these four genes, organisms of the same temperature range conditions are closer to each other than they are to organisms of different temperature range conditions. when comparing the number of neighboring species with the same temperature range conditions in the phylogenetic trees built from the four genes against that based on the 16s rrna genes , we did not observe statistically significant differences, indicating that phylogenetically close species tend to inhabit the same temperature range conditions.

when based on these four genomic regions, the prediction accuracy, averaged on the  <dig> cross-validation experiments, was  <dig> % for the complete genomes ,  <dig> % for the in-progress genomes , and  <dig> % for the metagenomes , respectively, all of which were much higher than the 50% accuracy rendered by random guessing. it should be noted that with less than 1% of the elements in {gcomplete} as the features, the prediction accuracy only degraded  <dig> % when compared to that rendered by the entire {gcomplete}, suggesting that these four genomic regions are predominantly correlated with the temperature range condition.

association analysis based on the environmental annotations in gold
when the ks tests were conducted on the mesophilic vs. thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms based on the temperature range annotations in the gold database, eight genomic regions were consistently selected out of the tests on the complete list of organisms and on the partial lists of organisms with particular phylogenetic/oxygen requirement/habitat/salinity categories being excluded. these genomic regions include the coding regions of k <dig> , k <dig> , k <dig> , k <dig> , and k <dig> , and the non-coding regions of k <dig> , k <dig> , and k <dig> . note that the coding regions of k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> were the genomic regions consistently selected when the ks tests were based on the temperature range annotations in the ncbi’s microbial genome project database. that is, despite the  <dig> % inconsistency in the temperature range annotations in the ncbi and gold databases, the four genomic regions were always identified as to possess gc content levels that are correlated with the temperature range conditions, suggesting their robustness to the possible annotation errors in the databases.

genomes whose temperature range conditions were consistently mis-classified
there were six genomes whose temperature range conditions were consistently mis-classified , whether the prediction was based on the entire {gcomplete} or just the four genomic regions. the optimal growth temperature and the temperature range conditions of these six genomes are summarized in table s- <dig> of the supplementary material. this result may prompt us to re-check the current temperature range condition annotations of the ncbi’s microbial genome project database. for example, we did find evidence to support our prediction for deinococcus geothermalis dsm  <dig> and did observe inconsistent annotations in the ncbi database for the temperature range conditions of methanococcus aeolicus nankai- <dig> and exiguobacterium sp.at1b.deinococcus geothermalis dsm  <dig> is labeled as mesophilic in the ncbi’s microbial genome project database, but is actually thermophilic with an optimum growth temperature of about 45°c to 50°c  <cit> . methanococcus aeolicus nankai- <dig> grows at temperatures between 20-55°c  <cit> , and exiguobacterium sp. at1b grows at temperatures between 15-55°c  <cit> . the growth temperatures of both methanococcus aeolicus nankai- <dig> and exiguobacterium sp. at1b cross the boundaries of ncbi’s definition for mesophilic and thermophilic organisms and overlap more with the mesophilic category. however, methanococcus aeolicus nankai- <dig> is labeled as mesophilic while exiguobacterium sp. at1b is labeled as thermophilic in the ncbi’s microbial genome project database. these examples suggest that the correlation relationships between certain genomic and ecological traits of prokaryotic genomes can potentially facilitate “reverse ecology”  <cit> , i.e., to fill/refine the environmental annotations of prokaryotic organisms based on their genomic features.

CONCLUSIONS
we have investigated the correlation relationships between the gc content levels in the coding and surrounding non-coding regions of individual genes and the temperature range conditions of prokaryotic organisms based on the statistical tests and prediction tests. through the ks tests conducted on all the mesophilic and thermo/hyperthermo-philic organisms, we have identified  <dig> genomic regions  whose gc content levels show different distribution patterns for organisms under different temperature range conditions and that can be considered as potentially correlated with the temperature range condition. when these  <dig> genomic regions were used to predict the temperature range condition of an organism, the prediction accuracy can reach  <dig> % for the complete genomes and  <dig> % for the in-progress genomes. four of these  <dig> genomic regions corresponding to the coding regions of k <dig> , k <dig> , k <dig> , and k <dig>  were consistently selected when the ks tests were conducted on partial lists of organisms with particular phylogenetic/oxygen requirement/habitat/salinity conditions being excluded and/or when the environmental annotations in the ncbi’s microbial genome project database or in the gold database were used. when these four genomic regions were used to predict the temperature range condition of an organism, the prediction accuracy reached  <dig> % for the complete genomes,  <dig> % for the in-progress genomes, and  <dig> % for the metagenomes. considering that they only account for less than 1% of all the  <dig> genomic regions potentially correlated with the temperature range condition but can to a great extent retain the prediction accuracy, we may interpret these four genomic regions as the core of the temperature range-correlated. our results have also demonstrated that the correlation relationships between the genomic and ecological traits can potentially facilitate reverse ecology.
