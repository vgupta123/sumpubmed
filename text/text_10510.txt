BACKGROUND
with the increasing number of immunocompromised patients, long-term hospitalized patients, and invasive medical conditions and therapy, the genus candida has emerged as a major group of opportunistic pathogens that cause both superficial and invasive infections in humans  <cit> . candida is considered to be the fourth most commonly isolated organism from nosocomial bloodstream infections in united states and the sixth most common in europe  <cit> . invasive infections caused by candida species are associated with significant morbidity and mortality  <cit> . although c. albicans accounts for the majority of infections, other non- albicans candida species such as c. tropicalis have increasingly been recognized as important human pathogens. c. tropicalis is the leading pathogen causing nosocomial fungemia and hepatosplenic fungal infections in patients with cancer, particularly leukemia patients  <cit> . c. tropicalis is the second most frequently isolated non-albicans pathogen in the asia-pacific region and in brazil  <cit> . in large independent epidemiologic surveys, the isolation rate of c. tropicalis from blood was shown to be 5-30%  <cit> . in evolutionary terms, this species is closely related to c. albicans  <cit> . previous studies conducted in asia show an intermediate frequency of fluconazole resistance for c. tropicalis strains, which was originally observed in c. glabrata isolates  <cit> . furthermore, a high proportion of c. tropicalis isolates exhibits low susceptibility to flucytosine  <cit> .

although several molecular typing methods have been used to determine the molecular epidemiology and resistance of c. tropicalis, such as mlst  <cit> , randomly amplified polymorphic dna   <cit>  and pulsed field gel electrophoresis   <cit> , population structures and genetic investigations for c. tropicalis have not been as extensive as they have been for c. albicans studies. mlst reveals different geographical origins, anatomic sources, and other characteristics between clades of closely related isolates  <cit> . furthermore, some isolates of c. tropicalis have been shown to be associated with anti-fungal resistance  <cit> . fifty-two diploid sequence types  from china were recently generated and added to the global mlst database  <cit> . rapd is considered to be a promising tool for yeast genotyping, especially when used with different primer combinations  <cit> . however it has some limitations for population structure analysis because it relies on a large intact dna template sequence that hinders reproducibility  <cit> . microsatellites are defined as short tandem repeats of two to six nucleotides, known to be highly polymorphic and have been widely used for polymorphism analysis of fungi  <cit> . microsatellite provides an alternative typing scheme because it is an easy-to-perform and reproducible method suitable for large-scale studies of c. tropicalis epidemiology. microsatellite-based typing methods using sets of genetic markers have been developed and reported for population structure analysis of c. albicans  <cit> , c. glabrata  <cit> , and c. parapsilosis  <cit> , but no studies have been published for genetic analysis of c. tropicalis.

the aim of this study was to develop a microsatellite-based typing method using a new set of six markers for population genetic analysis of c. tropicalis. the polymorphism of microsatellites was evaluated by pcr and allele sizing of  <dig> c. tropicalis isolates. our results indicate that the discriminatory power  of the  <dig> loci ranges from  <dig> - <dig> , illustrating this to be a useful method for genetic studies of c. tropicalis.

RESULTS
screening and selection of repeat regions in c. tropicalis genome sequence database
we searched the c. tropicalis genome using tandem repeat finder  software and generated over  <dig>  sequences whose repeated motif was at least 1 bp. the criteria defined were that the sequence should contain at least  <dig> repeats with equal or greater than 2 bp in the core motif. in total,  <dig> microsatellite loci were selected. these sequences have a high probability of showing greater genetic variability, are likely located outside known coding regions, and dispersed evenly throughout the genome. to evaluate the effectiveness of the  <dig> loci,  <dig> pairs of specific primers were designed and genomic dna from  <dig> c. tropicalis isolates was used as a template for pcr. after removing the unsuccessful and non-polymorphic loci, eight microsatellite markers were chosen for further microsatellite analysis . locus-specific primers were then designed for these markers. the forward primers were fluorescently labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein , 6-carboxyhexafluorescein , 5-carboxy-x-rhodamine , or 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine  .table  <dig>

microsatellite analysis
in order to evaluate the specific amplifications and polymorphisms, the microsatellites selected were used to type  <dig> clinically independent c. tropicalis isolates. c. tropicalis is a diploid species, therefore one or two pcr fragments per locus were obtained for each strain, and each fragment was assigned as a unique allele. isolates presenting two pcr products were typed as heterozygous, while strains having a single pcr fragment were typed as homozygous. one allele of each length was sequenced. for most of the microsatellite markers, a direct correlation between the fragment size and the number of microsatellite repeats was found, with the differences in fragment sizes being consistent with the variation in the number of repetitions . however, for few alleles, we sequenced repeatedly to obtain the correct number of repeats. in the case of ctrmm <dig> and ctrmm15n loci, several isolates of these alleles were sequenced and analyzed using blast, which showed that they contain unstable flanking areas, such as a deletion . six loci  were used for final population structure and genetic analysis. the characterizations of the loci selected are illustrated in table  <dig>  in total,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> alleles were found for the ctrm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci, respectively . the analysis of the  <dig> isolates revealed all microsatellite loci to be polymorphic, showing  <dig> to  <dig> alleles from  <dig> to  <dig> distinct genotypes . the detailed information of alleles and the corresponding number of repeats are shown in table  <dig>  the differences in length for the  <dig> markers were due to a varying fold repeat of a hexanucleotide . the dp for each marker was calculated according to the simpson index   <cit>  as follows: dp=1−1nn−1∑j=1snjnj− <dig> where n is the number of strains, s is the total number of different genotypes, and nj is the number of strains of genotype j  <cit> . the results show that ctrmm <dig>  producing  <dig> different alleles and  <dig> genotypes, was the microsatellite with the highest dp , while ctrmm <dig> presented the lowest dp , with different  <dig> alleles and  <dig> genotypes . the total number of different alleles and genotypes and the respective frequencies obtained for all microsatellite markers examined in table  <dig>  amplification products were observed for all  <dig> c. tropicalis strains at all  <dig> loci, showing powerful typing ability in all cases except for loci ctrmm <dig>  ctrmm <dig>  and ctrmm <dig>  with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> strains of unsuccessful pcr amplification respectively . the amplifications were performed in triplicate. the particular strain numbers and repeated motif numbers of each allele are summarized in table  <dig>  the sequencing of alleles allowed us to determine that the exact length of the pcr products. for example, alleles  <dig> and  <dig> for ctrmm <dig> are composed of  <dig>  and  <dig>  repeats .figure  <dig>

population structure study of c. tropicalis using multiple typing methods
fifty-eight of the c. tropicalis isolates typed by mlst and pcr fingerprinting analysis were selected for genotyping using the microsatellite markers so that the results of these three typing methods could be compared. based on the microsatellite loci database, an unweighted pair group method  tree was constructed based on genetic distances , in which the genotyping type for each strain by the other two methods was also shown. eight distinct short tandem repeat  clusters were constructed , while  <dig> mlst groups and  <dig> rapd groups were produced . microsatellite analysis detected  <dig> different genotypes, whereas mlst detected  <dig> genotypes and rapd detected  <dig> genotypes. therefore, it could be deduced that str analysis and mlst were both found to have a high capacity to discriminate isolates, and a relatively high level of concordance between the results was displayed . for better understanding of the dp of mlst and microsatellite for c. tropicalis, we constructed minimum spanning trees  based on microsatellite allele profile  and mlst allele profile . mlva cluster  <dig> is composed of strains predominant in mlst group  <dig>  mlva cluster  <dig> contains strains from mlst group  <dig> and some singletons . mlva cluster  <dig> has only  <dig> strains, one from mlst group  <dig>  and the other is singleton . mlva cluster  <dig> includes  <dig> singletons and  <dig> from mlst group  <dig> . for cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  they are totally composed of singletons . while strains in mlst groups  <dig> and  <dig> were also in str cluster  <dig> and  <dig> . one strain in mlst group <dig> is separated far away and included in cluster  <dig> . the same situation happened to mlst group  <dig>  in which one strain is split as singleton . for mlst group  <dig>  all its strains are separated as independent ones . in figure 3b, trees are built on mlst allele profile and its corresponding relationship with mlva cluster is shown. strains from mlva cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> clustered as mlst group  <dig> . for group  <dig>   <dig> singletons and strains in mlva cluster  <dig> are included . group  <dig> are totally composed of the same strains in cluster  <dig> . group  <dig> is made up with  <dig> strains in mlva cluster  <dig> . strains in group  <dig> are all in mlva cluster  <dig> . group  <dig> is comprised completely by singletons . strains in cluster  <dig> disperse widely in mlst mst . strains from cluster <dig> and cluster  <dig> are separated as singleton independently . isolates bzr- <dig> were separated far away from bzr- <dig> and bzr- <dig> of mlst group  <dig> . no relationships were found between genotypes and specimen type, hospital origin, and fluconazole resistance in either typing method. the differences in size polymorphisms of microsatellite analysis indicate that microsatellites appear to be evolving with a higher rate of sequence divergence and may be helpful for driving deeper establishment of unrelated profiles, which could be useful in outbreak situations but less effective for the determination of long-term genetic relatedness  <cit> .figure  <dig>

discussion
c. tropicalis is a diploid organism similar to c. albicans. a variety of strain typing methods have been used for the differentiation of the c. tropicalis family, including pcr fingerprinting  <cit> , mlst  <cit> , and pfge  <cit> . shu-ying li et al.  <cit>  compared mlst via pfge for population structure and genetic relationship analysis of clinical c. tropicalis isolates. they found that the genetic profiles of c. tropicalis clinical isolates obtained by these two methods were highly correlated, in which mlst was slightly less discriminatory than pfge. in addition, fluconazole-resistant c. tropicalis isolates were grouped into a clonal cluster in both mlst and pfge  <cit> . another report showed that most of the tested c. tropicalis isolates were assigned to a single large recently evolved group that contained several small clonal clusters. it indicates that c. tropicalis resembles c. albicans phylogenetically. such evolution pattern could be explained as a predominantly clonal mode of reproduction but with a frequency of recombination events high enough to generate a population with characteristics similar to a sexually reproducing species  <cit> . in a previous study, we discovered new mlst types of c. tropicalis from mainland china, showing several independent groups when compared to the global c. tropicalis mlst database  <cit> . it had been considered that rapd was a promising tool for yeast genotyping, especially when used with multiple primer combinations, by which subtypes are found to be related to their geographic origin, evolutionary and taxonomic classification  <cit> . however, with the development of newer molecular methods, rapd is now considered as unstable and is not easy to standardize. microsatellites are found in all genomes and are increasingly being used as molecular marker  <cit> . the microsatellite method is discriminatory, reproducible, and easy to perform. furthermore, the results remain stable over many generations  <cit> . microsatellite genotyping has been successfully used to characterize and rapidly type isolates of several yeast species including, aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae , penicillium marneffei  <cit> , c. albicans  <cit> , c. krusei  <cit> , c. parapsilosis  <cit> , c. glabrata  <cit>  and cryptococcus neoformans and gattii  <cit> .

to our knowledge, this is the first report developing and testing microsatellite markers for c. tropicalis. we screened the genome of c. tropicalis for microsatellites. after testing of the candidate loci, six markers were selected. all six loci display highly polymorphism rates and discriminatory power. ctrmm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> markers are the most discriminatory microsatellites, with 100% amplification efficiency, high discriminatory power and varying repeats of the same motif . sequencing confirmed that the length of polymorphisms were due to the number of nucleotide motif repeats. for the other markers ctrmm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  irregular correlation between repeat motif and sequence size for some alleles were observed. therefore, we sequenced these uncertain alleles to obtain the accurate length. the dp of these three, ctrm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  vary between  <dig> - <dig> . for marker ctrm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  there were 3– <dig> isolates of unsuccessful pcr amplification. we repeated three times for these amplifications. nucleotide mutation in the flanking area of those markers may lead to unspecific combination of primers to template dna. the second reason may be that the template dna area for designing primers is not so conserved for isolates with wide origins. with more sequences of c. tropicalis released, a more conserved area may be developed. in summary, the primers coverage ability and the dna structure changes may contribute to the unsuccessful amplification. ctrm <dig> loci displayed the highest dp and heterozygosity, while the ctrm  <dig> showed the lowest heterozygosity and dp. ctrmm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> markers displayed 100% amplification efficiency in this study using strains with limited geographic distribution. compared with polymorphic microsatellite loci  used for c. albicans  <cit> , whether they are efficient to distinguish world-wide strains still need further analysis. and with finish of more c. tropicalis whole genome, more microsatellite markers will be selected.

in our study, mlst and pcr-fingerprinting methods were used to evaluate the six microsatellite markers newly developed for studying the population structure, genetic relativity, and molecular epidemiology of c. tropicalis isolates from various geographic and anatomic sites. our data indicates that mlst and microsatellite analysis appear to have similar potentials to differentiate c. tropicalis and both have discriminatory power superior to rapd analysis. it is well known that rapd is a conventional dna-based typing method, while microsatellite and mlst are exact dna-based typing methods  <cit> . the interpretation of rapd patterns is based on the number of size of the amplified fragments, and banding patterns are easily effected by kinds of experimental conditions  <cit> . the drawbacks of rapd are its reproducibility and data comparison between labs. both microsatellite and mlst generate unambiguous results with an excellent reproducibility, which could be exchanged and compared globally  <cit> . although there was high agreement between the methods for the assignment of genotypes, disagreement of clustering of unrelated isolates was also observed . some singletons in the mlst analysis formed new groups using the str method. furthermore, strains clustered in mlst groups were separated and formed new str clusters with other isolates, such as mlst group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

in conclusion, these six new microsatellites are a valuable tool for the differentiation of c. tropicalis isolates and will have a strong application in studies that must distinguish epidemiologically related isolates, such as nosocomial cross-transmission analyses, and the study of kinetics of the colonization-to-infection process. the standardization of the microsatellite typing systems and the creation of public databases that would make microsatellite allele data available worldwide are essential issues that deserve attention and resources. the overall higher similarity level of gene sequences from c. tropicalis as compared with c. albicans may indicate that many more isolates are needed to be sequenced to reveal full strain diversity in c. tropicalis, or to discover a strain type well adapted to humans.

CONCLUSIONS
c. tropicalis is considered to be the leading pathogen causing nosocomial fungemia and hepatosplenic fungal infections in patients with cancer, particularly those with leukemia. several molecular typing methods have been used for studying c. tropicalis, but no study of microsatellite analysis has been published for genetic analysis of c. tropicalis. in this study, we firstly developed new microsatellite loci for c. tropicalis. the six loci selected showed high discriminatory power, similar discriminatory ability with mlst and more powerful than pcr-fingerprinting. these newly developed markers will be a valuable resource for the differentiation of c. tropicalis. more c. tropicalis isolates will need to be sequenced and analyzed in order to fully show the potential of these newly developed microsatellite markers.
