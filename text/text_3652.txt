BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic cells, transmembrane and secreted proteins undergo several modifications during their maturation; n-glycosylation is one of these modifications, and contributes to the functional conformation and to the selection of the final destination of these proteins  <cit> . yeast and mammals share the initial steps of n-glycosylation in the er, even if the pathways diverge between mammals and yeast in the golgi apparatus. indeed, in this cellular compartment, the extension of the oligosaccharide chain involves many specific glycosyltransferases. this specificity generates the observed diversity of glycan structures between different species and cell types  <cit> . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the glycosyltransferases are constituted by mannosyltransferases, which lead to the formation of two main types of mannan outer chain. many proteins of the cell wall and periplasm receive a large mannan structure that contains a long α- <dig> -linked backbone of about  <dig> mannoses with short α- <dig>  and α- <dig>  side chains. in contrast, the proteins of the internal organelles display a smaller core-type structure, with only a few mannoses  <cit> . the structure of the mannan outer chain has been investigated by the study of mnn  mutants isolated by ballou and co-workers  <cit> . the analysis of the partial n-glycan structures in these mutants has allowed the ordering of the steps of mannan synthesis. the work of munro suggests a model for the complete n-glycosylation pathway in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . in this model, the formation of the mannan outer chain is initiated by the och1p protein, a type ii membrane α- <dig> -mannosyltransferase that defines an early golgi compartment  <cit> . upon arrival in the golgi, all n-glycan cores receive a single α- <dig> -mannose added by och1p. the formation of the long α- <dig> -linked backbone is generated by two enzyme complexes: the m-pol i and m-pol ii complexes.

kluyveromyces lactis is a yeast species related to s. cerevisiae; its outer mannan chains differ from those of s.cerevisiae by having terminal n-acetylglucosamine and no mannose phosphate  <cit> . previous studies from our laboratory reported that the kloch1- <dig> mutation of kluyveromyces lactis yeast was mapped at  <dig> bp of the kloch <dig> gene and we found that the corresponding wild type allele encodes the functional homologue of the s. cerevisiae α <dig> -mannosyltransferase  <cit> . quantitative analysis of cell-wall components indicated a noticeable increase of chitin and β <dig> -glucans and a severe decrease of mannoproteins in the kloch1- <dig> cells as compared to the wild-type counterparts. in addition, fine-structure determination of the β <dig> -glucan polymer showed that, in the kloch1- <dig> strain, the β <dig> -glucans are shorter and have more branches than in the wild-type strain. moreover, the kloch1- <dig> cells showed a significantly improved capability of secreting heterologous proteins.

recent reports provide evidences that defects in protein n-glycosylation can cause mitochondrial deficiencies. an er-derived oxidative stress from misfolded proteins in an erv <dig> mutant of s.cerevisiae has been shown to led to upr activation, which cause the accumulation of ros from both the er and mitochondria, and resulted in cell death  <cit> . it has also been reported that dosage attenuation of dol-p- dependent glcnac-1-p transferase, alg <dig>  in haploid cells led to the loss of mtdna and respiratory deficiency  <cit> . also eos <dig>  a protein involved in the n-glycosylation, was required for tolerance to oxidative stress  <cit> . however, in most of the cases the mechanisms linking glycosylation and mitochondrial dysfunctions need to be elucidated. in this work we found that altered mitochondria functionality in cells deprived of the golgi α- <dig> -mannosyltransferase is caused by a defective calcium homeostasis.

RESULTS
altered mitochondrial biogenesis in kloch1- <dig> cells
the k. lactis kloch <dig> gene encodes the α- <dig> -mannosyltransferase localized in the golgi apparatus and involved in the glycosylation process and in cell wall morphogenesis. the kloch1- <dig> mutant strain showed enhanced heterologous protein production  <cit> . however, the kloch1- <dig> cells displayed a higher generation time in rich fermentable medium in comparison with wild type cells, and in the presence of respiratory carbon source, the biomass yield was strongly reduced. this prompted us to investigate if the lack of the α  <dig> -mannosyltransferase activity in k. lactis cells could be associated with altered mitochondrial functionality. to this end cells were incubated with daspmi, a fluorescent probe that is taken up by mitochondria as a function of membrane electrochemical potential. we found indeed a different distribution of the dye in the two strains: in the kloch1- <dig> background the cells showed a punctuate pattern and some ring structures instead of the regular tubular network of the wild type counterpart . in order to analyze possible alterations of the mitochondria structures, we transformed the mutant and wild type strains with a plasmid carrying the gfp fused to the mitochondrial signal sequence from the subunit  <dig> of the f0-atpase from neurospora crassa; this construct has been demonstrated to correctly deliver functional gfp into yeast mitochondria  <cit> . the fluorescence microscope observation of the mitochondrial matrix  showed, for the mutant cells, an hyperbranched mitochondrial net not revealed by the daspmi staining, whereas the mitochondrial morphology of the wild-type cells resulted identical to the one observed with daspmi. to further study the altered mitochondrial morphology, the mutant strain and its isogenic wild type counterpart were analyzed by electron microscopy. in ultrathin sections of the wild type cells  the mitochondria appeared as tubular structures, with normal morphology and typical cell peripheral distribution. the kloch1- <dig> cells showed instead mitochondria that were either stretched and without crests in the middle part either round swollen at the ends, in agreement with the altered morphology observed by daspmi staining.

mitochondrial dysfunction is often associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species , we therefore evaluated the amount of ros by using the fluorescent dye  <dig> dihydrorhodamine . this compound accumulates inside the cells and it is oxidized to the corresponding fluorescent chromophore by ros. the fluorescence microscope observation revealed that 28% of kloch1- <dig> cells accumulated ros as compared to 5% of the parental strain; these values increased up to 48% and 18% in the mutant and wild type cells respectively after challenge with a generator of oxidative stress, such as the hydrogen peroxide . to further investigate the oxidative stress taking place in the mutant, k. lactis cells were challenged for  <dig> and  <dig> h with a cytotoxic concentration of  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide. a strong reduction of the survival rate was observed after a  <dig> hours treatment in cells lacking the α  <dig> -mannosyltransferase activity , and after  <dig> hours only 41% of mutant cells survived versus 93% of the parental ones. in addition, the mutant strain was not able to grow in the presence of  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide .

isolation of klcmd <dig> as extragenic suppressor of oxidative stress occurring in kloch1- <dig> cells
in order to highlight genetic interactions underlying the phenotypes observed, we performed a screen to identify multicopy suppressors able to relieve the growth defect of cells lacking α  <dig> -mannosyltransferase activity on ypd supplemented with  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide . three of the plasmids, isolated from the corresponding clones that survived the selection procedure, resulted to be identical and were further analyzed. sequencing analysis revealed that the k. lactis dna fragment present in the plasmid contained an orf of  <dig> bp with  <dig> bp upstream of the putative atg start codon and  <dig> bp downstream of the putative stop codon. the protein encoded by this orf resulted to be klcmd <dig>  the homologue of the s. cerevisiae calmodulin gene  <cit> . the gene was able to restore the growth defect of kloch1- <dig> cells on  <dig> mm h2o <dig> also when cloned in a centromeric plasmid .

we wondered if transcriptional variations of klcmd <dig> gene could occur in kloch1- <dig> mutant cells as compared to the parental strain. in these cells we effectively observed a strong reduction of the mrna of the calmodulin protein as revealed by northern blotting analysis .

the presence of klcmd <dig> on a centromeric plasmid in the mutant strain was able to reduce the oxidative stress of these cells as revealed by the dhr staining. the amount of positively stained cells of the transformants, in fact, was significantly reduced in comparison to that of the mutant cells: 8% versus 28% respectively . however, the kloch1- <dig> cells transformed with cpklcmd <dig> did not show an increase in the survival capabilities with respect to the mutant cells, when challenged for  <dig> hours with  <dig> mm .

the mitochondrial functionality of the kloch1- <dig> cells carrying either the calmodulin on a centromeric  or on a multicopy plasmid  was studied by daspmi staining . the kloch1- <dig> cells transformed with cpklcmd <dig> showed a functional hyperbranched mitochondrial net in contrast to the dots phenotype, typical of the mutant . these data indicate that the mitochondrial net that was visualised by mitogfp in kloch1- <dig> cells  became able to establish a membrane electrochemical potential just by adding a few copies of calmodulin in these cells.

in addition, when the mutant cells were transformed with mpklcmd <dig>  the daspmi staining revealed a wild type-like mitochondrial network, even if in some cases ring structures were still present .

in addition to the generation of cellular energy, mitochondria also play an important role in regulating calcium homeostasis  <cit> . based on this and on the suppression of the mutant phenotypes by calmodulin, we looked for possible calcium homeostasis alterations in kloch1-1cells. we thus investigated if cells lacking α  <dig> -mannosyltransferase activity could grow in presence of egta, a cationic chelator. as reported in the panel a of the figure  <dig>  the growth of mutant cells was strongly inhibited when ypd plates were supplemented with this chelating agent. this inhibition was suppressed by adding in the growth medium,  <dig> mm cacl <dig> together with the egta, indicating that an altered calcium homeostasis occurs in the mutant strain.

intracellular calcium determinations, carried out using fura-2am, indeed showed that the calcium content of kloch1- <dig> cells was significantly reduced with respect to the cation concentration present in the wild-type cells determined in the same conditions . measurements employing cells deleted for the golgi ca2+-atpase, klpmr1p, previously reported to have increased cytosolic calcium content, were used as additional calibration control.

increased calcineurin activity is required in kloch1- <dig> cells for normal mitochondrial morphology and cell wall structure
since calmodulin acts as a mediator of calcium signals in eukaryotic cells mainly through the ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, we investigated the possible role of this phosphatase in the mitochondrial phenotypes of kloch1- <dig> mutant cells.

calcineurin requires both the regulatory and the catalytic subunits for full activity, and the klcnb <dig> and klcna <dig> genes respectively were isolated . the reduced expression of klcmd <dig> observed in the mutant strain prompted us to first analyze whether a similar behaviour could be observed also for the calcineurin subunits. the kloch1- <dig> cells effectively showed a decrease of klcnb <dig> transcript in comparison to the wild type cells, and a similar result was observed also for the catalytic subunit . in order to obtain the expressional balance of both regulatory and catalytic subunits of calcineurin, we transformed kloch1- <dig> strain with the plasmids harbouring klcnb <dig>  and klcna <dig>  genes. surprisingly, the effect of the increased dosage of the regulatory subunit alone in the kloch1- <dig> cells on the egta sensitivity of the mutant strain was identical to that of the overexpression of both subunits . similar results were also obtained when the amount of ros was analyzed: 15% of the kloch1- <dig> cells transformed with pklcnb <dig> alone or together with pklcna <dig> were positive to the staining with dhr as compared to 28% of the mutant cells. in this case the suppression was not complete as compared to the almost complete recovery observed in kloch1- <dig> cells by increasing the dosage of calmodulin gene.

we then looked up to the mitochondrial structures and functionality by daspmi staining of the transformants. mutant cells carrying pklcnb <dig> vector alone showed a partial recovery of the tubular phenotype. we observed a reduced amount of dots and the appearance of tubules, whereas the same cells transformed also with the pklcna <dig> plasmid showed the typical tubular wild type-like network, although with a peripheral distribution . by electron microscopy analysis we observed only a partial recovery of tubular mitochondria in kloch1- <dig> cells harbouring only the pklcnb <dig> vector . however, when in the same strain we co-overexpressed also the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, the relieve was almost complete: mitochondria appeared very similar to the wild type ones and mitochondrial cristae were visible, in agreement with the structures observed by fluorescence microscopy .

we previously reported that the kloch1- <dig> mutant had increased cell wall thickness and some dark-stained rims were present within the amorphous layer in comparison with wild-type cells  <cit> . notably, in cells depleted of α <dig>  mannosyltransferase activity but transformed with the pklcnb <dig> and pklcna <dig> plasmids, the thickness of the cell wall resembled that of the wild-type parent . in agreement with the electron microscopy observations, we found that the ability of the mutant cells to grow in presence of the cell wall-perturbing agent calcofluor white was completely restored only when the cells were transformed with both subunits of calcineurin . identical results were also obtained when congo red, another molecule interfering with the cell wall, was used . this phenotype has to be ascribed to the increased activation of the calcineurin signaling pathway that generates a rescue of a normal biogenesis of cell wall.

discussion
protein n-glycosylation is one of the fundamental metabolic pathways in cell fate. deciphering how n-glycosylation controls specific metabolic and signaling events has become important to unraveling the underlying basis of cellular behavior. in yeasts, outer chain branching is initiated in the golgi apparatus by the α- <dig> -mannosyltransferase och1p. here, we reported that altered mitochondrial functionality and oxidative stress take place in k. lactis cells carrying a mutation in kloch <dig> gene. the mutant cells showed also a reduction in the calcium content and in the expression of genes related to calcium signalling.

although a direct link between n-glycosylation defects and mitochondrial functionality has not been reported, underglycosylation of proteins destined for the mitochondria could interfere with, or abolish, the import of these proteins into the organelle. indeed, a  <dig> kda n-glycoprotein has been identified in rat liver inner mitochondrial membranes that physically interacts with complex i and the f1f0-atp synthase  <cit> ; tim11p, its yeast homologue, has one potential n-glycosylation site. also, mutations in the signal recognition particle  receptor have been shown to disrupt the reticular structure of both the er and mitochondria in yeast  <cit> , suggesting that a proper er structure and/or functionality is required for maintaining the mitochondrial network. it is conceivable that the underglycosylation of proteins has adverse effects on the early secretory compartments structure and functionality, which, in turn, influences mitochondria characteristics.

moreover, we found that klcmd <dig> gene was a suppressor in kloch1- <dig> cells of either ros accumulation or sensitivity to the oxidative stress, when h2o <dig> was added in the growth medium. on the other hand, the increased dosage of this ca2+-signalling gene was not able to increase the survival rate of the mutant cells undergoing a treatment with cytotoxic concentration of the same oxidant agent. these data suggest that, in the mutant cells, the altered defence mechanisms against high concentration of a ros generator were not fixed by calmodulin itself.

the kloch1- <dig> cells also showed a reduction in the calcium content, accompanied by a reduction in the expression of the klcmd <dig>  klcna <dig> and klcnb <dig> genes, encoding for key components of the calmodulin/calcineurin signalling pathway. in fungi, conserved signal transduction pathways control fundamental aspects of growth, development and reproduction. two important classes of fungal signalling pathways are the mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades and the calcium-calcineurin pathway. they are triggered by an array of stimuli and target a broad range of downstream effectors such as transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, protein kinases and other enzymes, thereby regulating processes such reproduction, morphogenesis and stress response  <cit> . we can thus hypothesize a possible activation of a mapk signaling in kloch1- <dig> cells that in turn could down modulate the calcium signaling pathway. it has been found that in k. lactis cells deleted in pmr <dig> gene and sharing phenotypes with the kloch1- <dig> mutant, such as cell wall defects, oxidative stress and altered calcium homeostasis, the hog <dig> mapk cascade resulted activated  <cit> .

s. cerevisiae calmodulin, a ca2+ binding protein, regulates many cell processes both depending or not upon the intervention of ca2+ ions. among those ca2+-dependent is the organization of the actin cytoskeleton; moreover mutations in cmd <dig> resulted colethal, suggestive of functional interactions, with the inactivation of genes encoding components of the glycosylation pathways like anp <dig>  cwh <dig> and mnn <dig>  <cit> ; mutations in such genes also result in altered morphology of actin cytoskeleton. we should also take into account that, although och <dig> deletion mutant of s.cerevisae in the by <dig> background was sensitive to egta, the mutant strain was not altered in the expression of calmodulin and calcineurin genes . however, we can not exclude the possibility that a reduction in the activity of the calcium signalling proteins can occur in the och <dig> deleted cells.

mitochondrial plasticity and functionality strongly depend upon the interactions between mitochondria and cytoskeleton. several shape-related proteins have been described in s.cerevisiae, localized on the mitochondria surface and reported to interact with actin  <cit> ; however the individual role and underlaying mechanisms are still unsolved.

another unanswered question is how do cells change the mitochondrial shape upon cell signals. in the case of calcium signalling, a relevant player could well be gem1p, a member of the miro gtpase family  <cit> ; gem1p is also localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane with its gtpase domain and, most notably, its ef-hand calcium binding domain exposed in the cytosol.

we are tempting to speculate that the altered calcium availability we observed in kloch1- <dig> cells could be originated by a defective calcium membrane channel mid1/cch <dig>  in fact, it has been demonstrated that s. cerevisiae mid <dig> requires a full glycosylation to correctly localize and assemble at the level of the plasma membrane  <cit> .

in mammalian cells ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent ca2+ channels  causes a rapid halt in mitochondrial movement and induces mitochondrial fission. vdcc-associated ca2+ signaling stimulates phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein  <dig>  at serine  <dig> via activation of ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase iα . in neurons and hela cells, phosphorylation of drp <dig> at serine  <dig> and dephosphorylation at serine  <dig>  both calcineurin-dependent, are associated with increase in drp <dig> translocation to mitochondria  <cit> .

nevertheless, one cannot exclude that defective kloch <dig> gene induce reduced glycosylation of other proteins relevant for calcium handling; scrutiny of such picture will deserve future work.

CONCLUSIONS
a proper functioning of outer chain-extension of mannoproteins in k. lactis is required for correct calcium homeostasis. the impairment of kloch <dig> results in a low calcium/calmodulin based signaling and altered mitochondria morphology and functionality. the reported data strongly indicate a novel link between relevant cell processes taking place in separate compartments.
