BACKGROUND
lipopolysaccharide , the most abundant molecule on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, acts as a permeability barrier and renders the outer-leaflet of the outer membrane  relatively impermeable to hydrophobic antibiotics, detergents  <cit> , and host complement  <cit> . lps consists of three major components: lipid a, core polysaccharides and o-linked polysaccharides. lipid a, with its fatty acid anchors , is an endotoxin primarily responsible for tnfα-mediated septic shock. the addition of myristic acid to the lipid a precursor is catalyzed by the enzyme msbb  <cit> .

it has been shown that msbb salmonella serovar typhimurium exhibits severe growth defects in lb and sensitivity to bile salts  and egta-containing media. however, compensatory suppressor mutants can be isolated that grow under these conditions. one of these suppressor phenotypes results from a mutation in soma, a gene of unknown function  <cit> . msbb salmonella typhimurium strains have recently been developed as potential anti-cancer agents that possess impressive anti-tumor activity in mice  <cit> . in a phase i clinical study msbb salmonella were shown to be safe in humans when administered i.v. however, bacteria were rapidly cleared from the peripheral blood of humans and targeting to human tumors was only observed in few patients at the highest dose levels of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/m <dig> and  <dig> × 109/m <dig>  <cit> . toso et al.  <cit>  noted that ys <dig>  grew best in air without added co <dig> 

the potential to grow in acidic and co2-rich environments is a hallmark of pathogenic bacteria, enhancing persistence within phagocytes and survival inside the host. sensitivity to co <dig> and low ph of msbb salmonella strains might explain poor colonization of tumors, which often contain high levels of co <dig> and lactic acid  <cit>  due to the warburg effect, also known as aerobic glycolysis, whereby glucose uptake is elevated while oxidative phosphorylation is reduced, even in the presence of oxygen. our previous work on suppressors of msbb salmonella raised the possibility that secondary mutations could suppress sensitivity to 5% co <dig> and acidic conditions.

here we report that the growth of msbb salmonella is highly inhibited  in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere in lb media as well as under low ph conditions when compared to wild-type salmonella. furthermore, several co <dig> resistant clones were selected from an msbb salmonella transposon library . three mutations were mapped and all were shown to contain the tn <dig> marker in the zwf gene, which encodes the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase and is tightly linked to the msbb gene.

RESULTS
co <dig> sensitivity of msbb salmonella
co <dig> sensitivity was first observed when ys <dig>  an msbb puri suwwan deletion strain of salmonella typhimurium, was plated on blood or lb plates and incubated in a 5% co <dig> incubator . suwwan deletion strains lack ~ <dig> genes in the  <dig>  to  <dig>  cs region of the chromosome  <cit> . in our studies, plating identical amounts  to duplicate plates incubated at 37°c in either air or 5% co <dig>  few or no colonies of ys <dig> were observed after  <dig> hours of incubation at 37°c in 5% co <dig> . however, by plating more cells, the presence of a few resistant colonies could be detected, as we obtained  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml on plates incubated in air and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml on plates incubated in the presence of 5% co <dig>  a greater than  <dig> log reduction. this co <dig> sensitivity, first observed in ys <dig>  is also observed in a simple msbb mutant . in contrast, wild-type salmonella typhimurium , salmonella typhi , and escherichia coli  are resistant to 5% co <dig> . interestingly, msbb e. coli  was not sensitive to co <dig> , consistent with there being physiologically relevant differences between the e. coli and salmonella in regard to the loss of msbb function, as has been previously observed  <cit> . these differences obscure or compensate for obvious growth defects in msbb e. coli.

co <dig> sensitivity was found in all msbb salmonella strains tested so far, indicating that co <dig> sensitivity is a direct result of the lack of lipid a myristoylation . consistent with these results, normal growth in co <dig> was completely restored when msbb was expressed from a plasmid ) .

the soma  and suwwan deletion  msbb suppressors do not suppress sensitivity to 5% co2
two msbb salmonella strains with secondary mutations that allow faster growth are ys <dig> and ys <dig>  ys <dig> has a loss-of-function mutation in soma  <cit>  and ys <dig> has a large deletion, referred to as the suwwan deletion  <cit> , that includes soma plus ~ <dig> other genes. the soma mutation in ys <dig> suppresses growth defects on egta and salt-containing media  <cit>  and the suwwan deletion in ys <dig> suppresses sensitivity to egta, salt, and galactose macconkey media  <cit> . however, neither the soma mutation nor the suwwan deletion suppresses msbb-mediated sensitivity to 5% co <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  when plating identical dilutions containing greater than  <dig> cfu onto lb agar from an msb broth culture of ys <dig> and wild type salmonella, no ys <dig> colonies are detected after  <dig> hours of incubation in 5% co <dig> at 37°c. since we have not yet identified all of the genes within the suwwan deletion that are responsible for the suppressor phenotype, we focused our study on ys <dig>  which has clearly defined mutations in msbb and soma.

co <dig> resistant mutations are detected at high frequency in msbb soma salmonella
subsequent experiments revealed that spontaneous co <dig> resistant mutants are detected when higher numbers of ys <dig> bacteria are plated and incubated under 5% co <dig> conditions. the mutation frequency of spontaneous co <dig> mutants from an msb broth culture was determined to be ~ <dig> out of  <dig> , which is similar to the frequency that egta and galactose macconkey suppressor mutations arise in msbb salmonella  <cit> .

a loss-of-function mutation in zwf suppresses co <dig> sensitivity
in our preliminary studies, several spontaneous co <dig> resistant mutants were isolated that showed a high degree of instability. therefore, we subsequently focused on the use of tn <dig> mutagenesis, which is known to generate stable insertions primarily associated with null mutations. to screen for a mutation that would compensate for co <dig> sensitivity, a random tn <dig> insertion library of ys <dig> was created and selected on lb agar in 5% co <dig>   <dig> clones were isolated, of which we determined the insertion sites in three of the clones using a genome-walking method. all of the tn <dig> insertions identified were located in the monocistronic zwf gene. two of the insertions  were identical , located after open reading frame nucleotide  <dig>  and the third  was located at after base pair  <dig>  because we focused our screening on tn <dig> insertions, we do not know if other mutagenesis methods would have isolated clones with mutations in other genes. zwf encodes glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the pentose-phosphate-pathway . in this pathway, zwf converts glucose-6-phosphate, from glycolysis, to 6-phosphogluconate, generating nadph + h. the subsequent reaction, catalyzed by gnd, converts 6-phosphogluconate to ribulose-5-phosphate, generating nadph + h and co <dig> . a non-polar deletion  was created in zwf  using the pcvd <dig> vector  <cit>  to test if the phenotypes arise from loss of the zwf gene or a polarity effect. the zwf non-polar deletion was found to exhibit the same co <dig> growth phenotypes as the zwf tn <dig> insertions. subsequent experiments use the non-polar deletion in zwf in  <dig> and ys <dig>  a loss-of-function mutation in zwf results in smaller colony size than zwf+ strains on agar media in both wild type and msbb genetic backgrounds.

gluconate prevents suppression of co <dig> sensitivity by zwf
zwf catalyzes the first step of the pentose phosphate pathway . ppp produces nadph for anabolic pathways and the molecules generated by this pathway serve as building blocks for nucleotides, sugars, amino acids, and vitamins  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  zwf catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate. 6-phosphogluconate can also be formed from gluconate by gluconate kinase  <cit> , which bypasses the ppp's requirement for zwf . the addition of gluconate to media thereby allows for the production of 6-phosphogluconate in the absence of zwf. the enzyme gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  then decarboxylates 6-phosphogluconate, converting it from a 6-carbon to a 5-carbon  sugar and releasing co <dig> gas. perhaps a threshold of co <dig> must be passed to inhibit the growth of msbb salmonella and a loss-of-function mutation in zwf allows for the co <dig> level to remain below this threshold. previous reports of zwf e. coli show reduced co <dig> production when grown in minimal media with acetate or pyruvate as a carbon source. however, zwf e. coli produced more co <dig> than wild type when grown in minimal media with glucose  <cit> . further studies will be required to clarify the production of co <dig> by salmonella grown in luria-bertani-based media and its contribution to co <dig> sensitivity.

to test whether zwf's suppressive effects result from its role in ppp pathway products and not from some unknown function, we observed the effect of gluconate on co <dig> sensitivity in our mutants. growth of ys <dig> zwf was tested on lb- <dig> plates containing  <dig> % gluconate in ambient air and 5% co <dig> . as we hypothesized, ys <dig> zwf was not able to grow on lb- <dig> gluconate in 5% co <dig>  thus, we confirmed that the zwf's suppression of co <dig> sensitivity results from its known enzymatic step in the ppp pathway. we also found a new phenotype for unsuppressed msbb salmonella: ys <dig> does not grow on lb- <dig> agar in the presence of  <dig> % gluconate . to test if the production of 6-phosphogluconate or a downstream ppp metabolite is responsible for mediating co <dig> resistance, we tested for co <dig> resistance in a ys <dig> gnd-189::mudj mutant  and found that the strain remained co <dig> sensitive . therefore, we conclude that the production of 6-phosphogluconate, by either zwf or gluconate kinase, contributes to co <dig> sensitivity in an msbb genetic background.

zwf mutation suppresses both msbb-induced co <dig> sensitivity and osmotic defects
for further analysis of the msbb zwf phenotype, the zwf  mutation was transduced into msbb  and msbb soma  genetic backgrounds to generate strains ys <dig> zwf and ys <dig> zwf respectively. as shown in the replica plate series of figure  <dig>  growth of unsuppressed ys <dig> is inhibited on lb  and lb- <dig> gluconate  but it grew well on msb and lb- <dig> agar , confirming the results of murray et al.  <cit> . in contrast, growth of ys <dig> on msb and lb- <dig> agar is completely inhibited when the plates are incubated in the presence of 5% co <dig>  the introduction of the zwf mutation completely compensates for the phenotype and allows the bacteria to grow under 5% co <dig> on all three media . however, it does not rescue ys <dig> from gluconate sensitivity .

when nacl in lb plates is substituted with sucrose at iso-osmotic concentrations , growth of ys <dig> is also inhibited, indicating osmosensitivity of ys <dig>  interestingly, introduction of the zwf mutation improves growth of ys <dig> on lb and on lb- <dig> 5% sucrose agar, indicating that the zwf mutation can partially compensate for the msbb-induced osmotic growth defect.

msb media contains high levels of divalent cations, which have been proposed to increase lateral interactions between the phosphate groups of neighboring lipid a molecules  <cit> . based on murray et al.'s finding  <cit>  that a decrease in electrostatic repulsion between the phosphates of lipid a can help to compensate for the lack of the myristic acid residue, we investigated whether mg2+ and ca2+ would protect against the detrimental effects of 5% co <dig>  on agar plates, mg2+ and ca2+showed partial protection in ys <dig> .

ys <dig>  which contains the egta and salt resistance suppressor mutation soma  <cit> , grows well on lb , msb , lb- <dig>  and lb- <dig> sucrose  agar plates in air, but not when the plates are incubated in 5% co <dig> . in contrast, the strain ys <dig> zwf is able to grow on all of these media in co <dig>  indicating that the zwf mutation can compensate for the growth defect of msbb strains in co <dig> . subsequent experiments were performed using the ys <dig>  genetic background because unsuppressed msbb salmonella can not grow under mammalian physiological salt conditions  <cit> .

msbb soma salmonella are sensitive to co <dig> in lb and lb- <dig> broth
ys <dig> has severe morphological defects in lb broth under 5% co <dig> conditions that are suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in zwf
since our results show that msbb salmonella lose viability in the presence of 5% co <dig> , we examined msbb mutants grown in the presence of 5% co <dig> to determine if there are any defects in cell morphology or chromosome segregation. differential interference contrast  microscopy shows striking morphological defects under co <dig> conditions , with long, bulging filamentous ys <dig> cells. dapi staining shows no apparent chromosomal segregation defects, as no cells lacking dna were observed . however, the cell directly under the "k" and "l" labels appears to be lysing .

as shown in figures 5o and 5p, zwf suppresses the severe morphological defects in ys <dig> grown in lb in the presence of 5% co <dig>  many cells are elongated but lack gross morphological defects. growth in lb in a 5% co <dig> environment caused wild type atcc  <dig> salmonella to form minicells, with minicells  accounting for ~15% of the cells  . as seen in figure 5e and 5f,  <dig> zwf exhibits ~21% minicell formation in lb broth, even without co <dig> . thus, we conclude that both co <dig> and zwf can, either directly or indirectly, affect cell division.

β-galactosidase assays confirm cell lysis in lb in the presence of 5% co2
microscopy  suggested that some ys <dig> cells were lysing in lb in the presence of 5% co <dig>  to test if the decrease in cfu observed in ys <dig> in lb in the presence of 5% co <dig> resulted from cell lysis, a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase was electroporated into ys <dig> and ys <dig> zwf and the cells were grown in lb in the presence or absence of co <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  after  <dig> hours of growth, significant cell lysis is observed in ys <dig> grown in the presence of 5% co <dig> as measured by the release of the cytoplasmic enzyme β-galactosidase. furthermore, a loss-of-function mutation in zwf significantly reduces cell lysis in ys <dig>  no significant cell lysis is observed in the absence of co <dig> 

co <dig> sensitivity does not result from increased acidification of lb media and zwf suppresses sensitivity to acidic ph in lb broth
during this study, we observed that the ph of lb broth dropped from ph  <dig>  to ph  <dig>  after equilibration in 5% co <dig>  since co <dig> can acidify bicarbonate buffered media, we tested whether part of the co <dig> sensitivity was due to acidification of the media. thus, to test if increased or decreased ph would alter sensitivity to co <dig> in lb broth, we buffered lb broth to ph  <dig> , or  <dig> , and cultures were grown in the presence or absence of 5% co <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  wild type atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> zwf grow normally under all conditions in lb broth in the absence  or presence  of 5% co <dig>  in contrast, the growth of ys <dig> is significantly impaired when the ph of lb is  <dig> , with no significant increase in cfu after  <dig> hours , whereas when the ph of lb is  <dig> , ys <dig> grows well . a loss-of-function mutation in zwf allows for ys <dig> to grow well in lb broth at a ph of  <dig>  . 5% co <dig> inhibited the growth of ys <dig> and ys <dig> zwf in lb ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  . although zwf protects against 5% co <dig> in lb broth ph  <dig>  , it does not significantly improve survival in the presence of 5% co <dig> in lb broth ph  <dig>  , suggesting that an acidic ph is a component for zwf to suppress msbb-mediated sensitivity to 5% co <dig> 

β-galactosidase assays confirm cell lysis in lb broth, ph  <dig> , in air
to test if the loss of growth of ys <dig> in lb broth ph  <dig>  was the result of cell death or simply the result of inhibition or delay of cell division, β-galactosidase release was measured. as shown in figure 8a, significant cell lysis occurs after growth of ys <dig> for  <dig> hours in lb broth, ph  <dig>  but not ph  <dig>  . furthermore, a loss-of-function mutation in zwf significantly reduces cell lysis of ys <dig> grown in lb broth ph  <dig> . this reduction in cell lysis, as measured by release of the cytoplasmic enzyme β-galactosidase, correlates with increased cfu/ml numbers observed in ys <dig> zwf  grown in lb broth, ph  <dig>  .

zwf reduces ys <dig> cell lysis in the presence of 5% co <dig> in lb broth ph  <dig> , but not ph  <dig> 
since we observed that ys <dig> lysed when there was no net growth in lb broth ph  <dig>  while maintaining a relatively constant cfu/ml, we investigated if cell lysis occurs in ys <dig> zwf, which also exhibits little net growth with a relatively constant cfu/ml in the presence of 5% co <dig> in lb broth ph  <dig>  or  <dig>  . growth curves for these strains indicated that there was a decrease in cfu/ml when ys <dig> was grown in lb broth ph  <dig>  in the presence of 5% co <dig>  but that cfu/ml remained relatively constant if a loss-of-function mutation in zwf was present or if the ph of lb broth was  <dig>  . figure  <dig>  shows that significant cell lysis, as indicated by release of the cytoplasmic enzyme β-galactosidase, occurs when ys <dig> is grown in the presence of 5% co <dig> at ph  <dig>  or  <dig> , and in ys <dig> zwf grown in the presence of 5% co <dig> in lb ph  <dig> . ys <dig> zwf exhibited significantly less lysis in the presence of 5% co <dig> in lb broth ph  <dig> , showing that a loss-of-function mutation in zwf significantly suppresses sensitivity to co <dig> at neutral  or slightly acidic ph . again, we found that significant cell lysis can occur with a relatively constant cfu/ml .

discussion
msbb salmonella pleiotropy
the msbb gene was mutated to reduce the toxicity of salmonella in mice and humans  <cit> . in order for these strains to function within mammalian systems they must be able to persist under normal mammalian physiological conditions. in contrast to other reports  <cit> , we found msbb salmonella to have striking growth defects, demonstrating sensitivity to salt, egta, macconkey media, and polymyxin b sulfate  <cit> . here we report additional sensitivity to osmolarity, gluconate, acidic ph and 5% co <dig> growth conditions. significantly, msbb salmonella are sensitive to the conditions found within mammals, where blood has significant levels of salt and co2; we therefore we screened for a suppressor of msbb-associated co <dig> sensitivity.

zwf supresses co <dig> sensitivity in msbb salmonella
glucose-6-phosphate-dehdrogenase  catalyzes the first enzymatic step in the pentose phosphate pathway , which converts glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate and nadph + h. in e. coli, zwf is regulated by several mechanisms including anaerobic growth  <cit> , growth rate  <cit> , weak acids as well as superoxide  <cit> . weak acids appear to regulate zwf through the multiple antibiotic resistance  regulon, whereas superoxide exposure induces zwf through the sox r/s regulon and contributes to dna repair  <cit> . zwf mutants of pseudomonas are hypersensitive to superoxide generating agents such as methyl viologen  <cit> .

salmonella typhimurium zwf might be regulated by a different set of environmental signals than e. coli. superoxide, while clearly activating other soxr/s regulated genes like soda and fumc, does not induce zwf transcription  <cit> . s. typhimurium zwf mutants have been shown to be less virulent in mice and more sensitive to reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates  <cit> . in general, it is thought that the expression of zwf and subsequent generation of nadph helps cells to combat oxidative stress. interestingly, soxs mutants of salmonella are not attenuated in mice  <cit> , suggesting that even though zwf expression is important for survival, superoxide generated responses might not be required. in the case of msbb mutants, the zwf mutation restores wild type growth under 5% co <dig> and ph  <dig>  conditions, suggesting that the expression of zwf is detrimental for growth of msbb mutants in an acidic or increased co <dig> atmosphere. furthermore, our data showing that a loss-of-function mutation in gnd  does not suppress sensitivity to co <dig> suggests that the production of 6-phosphogluconate, by either zwf or gluconate kinase, contributes to co <dig> sensitivity in msbb salmonella.

msbb as a virulence factor?
several publications cite msbb as a virulence factor that is necessary for both septic shock and the ability to invade and persist in mammalian cells  <cit> . however, owing to the fact that msbb salmonella were tested under 5% co <dig> conditions, the lack of virulence may be partially or fully due to the inability of msbb salmonella to grow in the presence of the 5% co <dig>  further experimentation with msbb zwf salmonella will be necessary to determine which virulence defects are attributable to msbb lipid a and those that arise from sensitivity to 5% co <dig>  based upon this study and earlier studies on the sensitivity of zwf mutant to superoxides, zwf may both reduce virulence on one hand, yet potentiate growth under co <dig> conditions on the other, further complicating virulence analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we report new growth defects in msbb salmonella: sensitivity to gluconate and growth in hypertonic, acidic or 5% co <dig> conditions. these characteristics are in addition to the previously reported growth defects in the presence of salt, egta, polymyxin, or macconkey media. previous studies showing that msbb is a virulence factor require further evaluation of the role that co <dig> sensitivity plays. the potential for cryptic, spontaneous mutations remains a possibility that should be addressed by re-transduction under non-selective conditions followed by plating independently under co <dig> and ambient air. we have created an msbb soma zwf salmonella strain that is resistant to growth under acidic or 5% co <dig> conditions. this strain contains a loss-of-function mutation in zwf, an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that produces co <dig> as it converts a  <dig> carbon sugar to a  <dig> carbon sugar. the study of the virulence of msbb zwf salmonella will allow the determination of what types of virulence are attributable to cells having an msbb lipid a independent of sensitivity to 5% co <dig>  which is required for in vitro and in vivo virulence assays.
