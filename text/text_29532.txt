BACKGROUND
microtubules are dynamic polymers that facilitate transport and movement within the cell  <cit> . microtubule dynamics are a critical aspect of mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome capture and segregation  <cit> . factors that interfere with microtubule attachment keep the mitotic spindle checkpoint unsatisfied, thus causing mitotic arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation  <cit> .

microtubule dynamics can be modified by two groups of chemical inhibitors. the first group, represented by taxanes, stabilizes microtubules and is clinically used to treat breast, lung, bladder and head and neck cancers  <cit> . the second group of modifiers include vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine, disrupt microtubules and are used in the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, small cell lung and breast cancer, and other malignancies  <cit> . although these chemotherapeutic drugs are efficacious, new drug development is still needed due to intrinsic and acquired drug resistance and untoward actions of existing therapeutics.

intensive research has focused on the responses of cancer cells to microtubule inhibitors, and it is known that apoptosis is a common outcome triggered by either p53-dependent or p53-independent pathways . however, the response of non-transformed cells to microtubule inhibitors is less well understood. contrasting the response of non-cancer cells and tumor cells should enhance our understanding of the effects of microtubule inhibitors on cancer patients.

the disorazoles are a family of natural compounds isolated from the fermentation broth of the myxobacteria sorangium cellulosum  <cit> . disorazole a <dig>  one of the major components, was demonstrated to disrupt microtubules, leading to mitotic arrest and eventually apoptosis  <cit> . disorazole c <dig> , a relatively minor constituent of the fermentation mixture, was obtained synthetically since it was considered to have greater therapeutic potential due to the absence of the chemically reactive divinyl oxirane and -dienyl oxazole moieties  <cit>  . dz was found to cause microtubule depolymerization and mitotic arrest during a small molecule screen  <cit> . in this paper, we further examined the cellular responses to dz and compared our results to two known microtubule inhibitors, vinblastine  and taxol .

RESULTS
 <dig>  dz has the classical properties of microtubule inhibitors, including mitotic arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation
to analyze the effect of dz on microtubules, we preformed indirect immunofluorescence on immortalized retinal pigmented epithelial cells  treated with  <dig> nm of dz, a concentration similar to dz's ic <dig> concentrations in several tested cell lines  <cit> . one hour after dz was added, microtubules were observed to have retracted from the cell periphery, confirming that dz depolymerized microtubules and showing that the overall disruption was more severe at the distal plus ends . similar results were observed in cancer cells treated with dz .

one property that microtubule inhibitors share is that they cause mitotic arrest by activating or preventing the satisfaction of the spindle assembly checkpoint  <cit> . dapi-staining of chromosomes was used to demonstrate an increase in the mitotic index in both non-cancer and cancer cells  <dig> hours after dz treatment . similar results were observed using phosphorylated histone h <dig> staining .

finally, cell proliferation is typically blocked by microtubule disruption. after treatment with  <dig> nm of dz, the proliferation of immortalized human foreskin fibroblast cells  was inhibited, as determined by the mts assay . similar results were also obtained in rpe-htert cells . in summary, dz disrupts microtubules, arrests cells in mitosis and inhibits cell proliferation, similar to classical tubulin inhibitors.

 <dig>  after a prolonged mitotic arrest, cells treated with dz underwent mitotic slippage
after 38-hour treatment with  <dig> nm of dz, many rpe-htert cells showed fragmented nuclei , which were also observed in vbl or txl treated cells . this nuclear fragmentation was not due to apoptosis in these cells as demonstrated by low annexin-v staining ; rather, it was similar to the phenotype observed in cells abnormally exiting from a prolonged mitotic arrest, referred to as mitotic slippage  <cit> . to test directly whether mitotic slippage was occurring in response to dz treatment, we exploited live cell imaging. due to the low transfection efficiency of rpe-htert cells, we examined upci:scc <dig> cells  stably-transfected with gfp-tagged histone h2b. after treatment with  <dig> nm of dz for  <dig> hrs, most of the observed mitotic cells exited mitosis to form fragmented nuclei with decondensed chromosomes  within the  <dig>  hour recording window . of  <dig> cells arrested in mitosis, we found that 70% of them  underwent mitotic slippage, forming fragmented and decondensed micronuclei similar to the example shown in figure 2c. an additional 13% of cells underwent mitotic slippage and then cell death, which was characterized by chromosome decondensation shortly followed by recondensation and fragmentation of the chromatin into many small pieces. another 13% of cells underwent a mitotic catastrophe, characterized by many small and highly condensed chromatin fragments formed directly from mitotic arrested cells. finally, additional cells  maintained the mitotic arrest; these cells may be entering cellular senescence, seen previously with dz treatment  <cit> .

to confirm that mitotic slippage was the source of the fragmented nuclei in the majority of the population, serum starvation was used to arrest cells in g <dig>  after a 38-hour treatment with  <dig> nm of dz, less than 5% of the serum-starved rpe-htert cells showed fragmented nuclei, indicating that the observed nuclear fragmentation required progression through the cell cycle . similar results were obtained in hydroxyurea-treated cells, which were arrested in s phase, confirming that the nuclear fragmentation required transit through mitosis . although the cycling cells were able to escape the dz-induced arrest, they did not resume a normal cell cycle but arrested again in g <dig>  as indicated by facs analysis at  <dig> hours of dz exposure .

interestingly, upon examination of those fragmented micronuclei, filaments were found to accumulate around them forming a thick bundle, as shown by electron microscopy . these filaments stain positive with anti-tubulin antibodies by immunofluorescence  and we believe they are variants of the microtubule structures seen in untreated cells. similar perinuclear accumulation of microtubule-like structures was seen previously with a vinca alkaloid microtubule inhibitor  <cit> . the microtubules appear to be forming an abnormal array around the micronuclei, which might contribute to the fragmentation observed after dz treatment, but this will require further analysis.

 <dig>  mitotic slippage in non-cancer cells induced by dz is correlated with cyclin b degradation
previous studies indicate that mitotic slippage occurs via slow cyclin b degradation and abrogation of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint  <cit> . in our study, the protein level of cyclin b accumulated up to  <dig> hours in rpe-htert cells upon dz treatment and then sharply decreased . similarly, the percentage of cells undergoing mitotic slippage began to peak at  <dig> hours , suggesting that cyclin b degradation was also associated with mitotic slippage after dz treatment.

to study whether protein degradation was required for the observed mitotic slippage, we used the protease inhibitor mg <dig> to block cyclin b degradation. in mg132-treated cells, the percentage of cells undergoing mitotic slippage was dramatically reduced while the mitotic index remained high, indicating that cells blocked for proteasomal protein degradation were less likely to undergo mitotic slippage from dz . our data support the conclusion that cyclin b degradation was correlated with mitotic slippage in non-cancer cells after dz treatment.

 <dig>  p <dig> is stabilized after dz treatment, but p <dig> is not required for mitotic slippage
elevated levels of p <dig> have been observed previously in cells treated with microtubule inhibitors  <cit> , and therefore their role in mitotic slippage was examined here. as demonstrated in figure 5a, p <dig> accumulated in rpe-htert cells after dz treatment, comparable to that seen with vbl or txl treatment. however, the activation of p <dig> was not essential for mitotic slippage, as sirna knockdown of p <dig> in rpe-htert cells did not diminish the frequency of fragmented nuclei . to further confirm this, we used human foreskin fibroblasts transformed with a plasmid expressing human telomerase with wild-type p <dig>  or a stable-knockdown of p <dig> . no reduction of mitotic slippage was observed in cells unable to express p <dig>  thus confirming that p <dig> was not required .

 <dig>  non-cancer cells undergo mitotic slippage after dz treatment without activating apoptotic pathways, while cancer cells execute apoptosis
although mitotic slippage was previously considered a survival pathway to protect cells from apoptosis  <cit> , emerging studies have shown that mitotic slippage can also be coupled to apoptosis  <cit> . to study whether apoptosis was responsible for the mitotic slippage from dz exposure, we preformed four tests. only 15% of the rpe-htert cells were annexin-v positive, suggesting far fewer cells underwent apoptosis than nuclear fragmentation . furthermore, the percentages of nuclear fragmentation did not decrease when caspase inhibitors were used , indicating that mitotic slippage was independent of apoptosis. additionally, other apoptotic markers were also analyzed. these markers include: 1) cytochrome c staining, demonstrating little release of cytochrome c after dz treatment compared to the h2o <dig> control ; 2) mitochondrial membrane potential indicator mitotracker, revealing little loss of mitochondrial membrane potential upon dz treatment compared to the h2o <dig> control ; and 3) poly polymerase  cleavage, also revealing little or no apoptosis .

even when cells were treated with dz for  <dig> or  <dig> hours, very little apoptosis was observed . furthermore, other non-cancer cell lines, such as hff-htert  and up <dig> cells , also showed very little or no parp cleavage after  <dig> hours of  <dig> nm dz treatment . additionally, dna ladder formation was not observed in rpe-htert cells exposed to dz . taken together, our results indicate that the apoptotic pathway was not activated in the rpe-htert cells exposed to dz. however, parp cleavage was strongly observed in all the tested cancer cell lines , suggesting apoptosis pathway was activated in malignant cells by dz.

discussion
dz is a naturally existing compound that has been recently synthesized to evaluate its potential as a cancer therapeutic. in our study, dz treatment demonstrated a disruption of microtubules from the plus end, consistent with its proven ability to bind tubulin  <cit> , indicating that the mechanism of action of dz is similar to that of other classical microtubule disruptors. however, dz treatment seemed to show stronger mitotic slippage than vbl in rpe-htert cells , suggesting that dz can act differently than some other microtubule destabilizers.

previous studies of microtubule inhibitors' effects on non-transformed cells have been limited to a dna content-based analysis of cell cycle distribution. researchers have observed an accumulation of cells with a 4n dna content in the second cell cycle following mitosis, referred to as mitotic slippage  <cit> . however, the cause of this phenotype is not fully understood. recently, brito and rieder showed that mitotic slippage after nocodazole treatment occurs when the spindle-assembly checkpoint  fails to prevent a slow but continuous proteolysis of cyclin b  <cit> . in the current study, we observed that mitotic slippage after dz treatment was also correlated with cyclin b degradation.

p <dig> has been demonstrated to play a major role in cell cycle control  <cit> ; thus it may also be involved in mitotic slippage. in the p53-knockdown rpe-htert cells there was no loss of fragmentation; indicating that p <dig> was not required for mitotic slippage in the presence of this microtubule inhibitor. in fact, there was a consistent increase in mitotic slippage in the transient p <dig> knockdown cells. this could be due to p <dig> down-regulation of cdc <dig>  <cit> , which is demonstrated to be required for the proteolysis of cyclin b by activating anaphase-promoting complex, a mitotic ubiquitin ligase  <cit> . by knocking down p <dig>  cdc <dig> levels may increase, thus activating more ubiquitin ligase complexes and promoting cyclin b degradation. alternatively, the observed increase in the percentage of cells undergoing mitotic slippage may result from cells proliferating faster after p <dig> knockdown, which can increase the frequency of cells passing through mitosis. however, we did not see an increase in mitotic slippage with the stable p <dig> knockdown and this relationship will thus require further study.

it has been demonstrated that after mitotic slippage, non-cancer cells can be arrested in the next g <dig> stage in a p53-dependent manner  <cit> . similarly, after dz treatment, we also observed an accumulation of cells with a 4n dna content , as well as an induction of p <dig> , which is similar to the postmitotic g <dig> arrest of txl-treated non-cancer cells  <cit> . hence, we suggest that when non-cancer cells are treated with microtubule inhibitors, for example dz, they may have two "checkpoints" sequentially to ensure the fidelity of cell division. the first one is sac, which can cause mitotic arrest if microtubules are disrupted  <cit> . if sac is not effective enough, cells may slip out from mitotic arrest and become arrested in the next g <dig> stage  <cit> . based on our data and previous studies, it is plausible that p <dig> facilitates both of these "checkpoints" after microtubule disruption as described in the model .

p <dig> has often been found compromised in human cancer tissues  <cit> . in our study, p <dig> is either truncated  or undetectable  in cancer cell lines . this indicates that the apoptosis triggered by dz in cancer cells may be p53-independent.

finally, our data suggest that after exposure to a certain concentration of dz , cancer cells tend to execute apoptosis while non-cancer cells undergo mitotic slippage without activating the apoptotic pathways, indicating that non-cancer and cancer cells respond differently after dz treatment. those cells that do not die from apoptosis may become senescent, a phenotype discussed previously .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we analyzed the cellular response to a synthesized natural product, dz. although mitotic arrest induced by dz was observed in both non-cancer and cancer cells, these cells had different fates. non-cancer cells escaped from mitotic arrest  in a cyclin b-dependent and p53-independent manner without apoptosis. in contrast, cancer cells activated the apoptosis pathway. these differential responses observed after dz treatment were similar to the effects of vinblastine or taxol, suggesting a promising therapeutic potential of dz.
