BACKGROUND
bromodomain consists of a motif of 59â€“ <dig> amino acids  <cit> . it is a protein-protein interaction domain and has a specific binding affinity for acetylated lysines on n-terminal tails of histones  <cit> . several studies demonstrated that bromodomain is characteristic of proteins that regulate signal-dependent, but not basal, transcription during active proliferation through modulating chromatin remodeling or acetylation of histones, therefore facilitating accession of transcription factors to chromatin  <cit> . accummulating evidence showed that the genetic alterations of bromodomain genes contributed to the development of many human cancers and other disorders  <cit> . brd <dig> is a bromodomain-containing gene identified from nasopharyngeal carcinoma  cells by cdna representational difference analysis  <cit> . due to the sequence similarity with other bromodomain containing protein, it was suggested that brd <dig> may be as components of chromatin remodeling complexes and possess histone acetyltransferase activity  <cit> . together with e1b-ap <dig>  brd <dig> functions as an inhibitor of basic transcription in several viral and cellular promoters in the nucleus  <cit> . staal et al. demonstrated that brd <dig> protein  interacted with interferon regulatory factor  <dig> in the nucleus and associated with transcriptionally active chromatin in situ  <cit> . bp <dig>  the most homologous gene of brd <dig>  directly interacts with dvl- <dig>  enhances tcf-dependent gene expression induced by dvl- <dig>  and induces the nuclear translocation and formation of vesicular structures of beta-catenin with dvl- <dig> in a synergistic manner  <cit> , indicating that brd <dig> may play an important role in wnt signaling. an alternative critical role of brd <dig> gene arose from evidence that brd <dig> gene exhibited much higher-level of mrna expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia than in npc biopsies and cell lines  <cit> . over-expression of brd <dig> gene in npc cells was effective to inhibit cell growth and cell cycle progression from g <dig> to s phase  <cit> . but little is known about its transcriptional regulation. our previous studies located the promoter of brd <dig> gene in a  <dig> bp region   <cit> . in this report, we defined the minimal promoter of brd <dig> gene in a 55-bp region, and explored the role of c-myc in suppressive regulating of brd <dig> expression in npc cells. these findings will help to further understand and uncover the functions of brd <dig> gene in the pathogenesis of npc, and also provide a molecular model for studying the transcriptional regulation of other bromodomain family genes.

RESULTS
identification of brd <dig> minimal promoter
in order to define the minimal promoter of brd <dig> gene, six deletion constructs were generated from full-length promoter construct pgl3-404/+ <dig> . as shown in fig. 2a, pgl3-404/+ <dig> expresses strong luciferase activity  in both cos <dig> and 5-8f cells. two of the constructs, pgl3-311/+ <dig> and pgl3-404/+46/, show luciferase activity equally strong with the full length construct, whereas pgl3-168/+ <dig> and pgl3-404/+46/ display substantially lower luciferase activity . surprisingly, the luciferase activities of pgl3-266/+ <dig> and pgl3-266/- <dig>  are as strong as that of pgl3-404/+ <dig> in cos <dig> cells, but have almost no activity in 5-8f cells .

indeed, the selective promoter activity of pgl3-266/- <dig> in cos <dig> and 5-8f cells was confirmed by direct gfp fluorescence assay. as shown in fig. 2b, pgl3-404/+46/gfp exhibits strong gfp fluorescence both in 5-8f and cos <dig> cells, whereas pgl3-266/-212/gfp displays fluorescence only in cos <dig> cells, but shows almost no fluorescence in 5-8f cells.

brd <dig> minimal promoter activity is inversely related to c-myc expression
we next detected the activity of brd <dig> minimal promoter in other cell types by using the luciferase assay. as shown in fig. 3a, the luciferase activity of pgl3-266/- <dig> in cos <dig> cells is  <dig> % of the luciferase activity of pgl3-404/+ <dig> in cos <dig> cells, but only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the luciferase activity of pgl3-404/+ <dig> in hek <dig> and u <dig> cells respectively. no luciferase activity of pgl3-266/- <dig> was found in hne <dig>  cne <dig>  6-10b, 5-8f, mcf- <dig> and sw <dig> cells. direct gfp fluorescence assay showed similar results . these results indicate that the 55-bp promoter fragment -266/- <dig> of brd <dig> gene selectively functions in some cell types.

to identify the upstream regulatory factor of brd <dig> minimal promoter, which might account for the suppressive regulation of brd <dig> promoter activity in the above mentioned cell lines, we analyzed sequence -266/- <dig> of brd <dig> gene by using matinspector professional program. as shown in fig. 3b, three critical putative binding sites including the binding site for myc-max , an e2f <dig> binding site , and a sp1/myc-max overlapping site  were found. we, therefore, examined the endogenous expression of these transcription factors in all cell lines used in this study. as shown in fig. 3d, sp <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in all cell lines whereas e2f <dig> is expressed in all analyzed cells except cos <dig> cells. in rt-pcr assay, two different bands were amplified in cos <dig> cells by using the same primers to detect e2f <dig> expression in other eight cell lines . c-myc was expressed strongly in the cell lines including hne <dig>  cne <dig>  6-10b, 5-8f, mcf- <dig> and sw <dig>  in which promoter -266/- <dig> showed almost no activity. very weakly expressed c-myc was detected in cos <dig>  hek <dig> and u <dig> cells, in which promoter -266/- <dig> was active . these results indicate that the activity of brd <dig> minimal promoter is inversely related to c-myc expression, suggesting that c-myc may play a critical role in regulating of brd <dig> minimal promoter.

transcription factor sp <dig> and c-myc specifically binds to bdr <dig> minimal promoter
to identify the direct transcription factors that are responsible for the promoter activity of brd <dig> gene, emsa and supershift assays were performed. as shown in the right panel of fig. 4a, a strong and a weak dna-protein complex was formed by using the radiolabeled -223/- <dig> fragment as a probe. the complex formation was fully suppressed by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of cold wild type -223/- <dig> fragment , but not by 100-fold molar excess of cold mutated -223/- <dig> fragment as competitor. moreover, this complex can be shifted with either anti-sp <dig> or anti-c-myc, but not with irrelevant ha antibody. these results indicate that the sp1/myc-max binding site at - <dig> to - <dig> is specific. both sp <dig> and c-myc are able to bind to the overlapping site of myc-max/sp <dig> 

the specificity of the e2f <dig> binding site was analyzed with a probe coding for an e2f <dig> binding site spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> bp. two dna-protein bands found. they were totally inhibited by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of cold wild type oligonucleotide, but not by 100-fold molar excess of cold mutated oligonucleotide as competitors . these complexes can't be shifted with either anti-e2f <dig> or anti-ha, indicating that the e2f <dig> binding site at -243/- <dig> of brd <dig> promoter is a functional binding site, but is not an e2f6-specific site.

finally, we examined the specificity of myc-max binding site at - <dig> to - <dig> of brd <dig> minimal promoter. a strong and a weak dna-protein complex were formed with -260/- <dig> as a probe, and both were completely abolished by adding either 100-fold molar excess cold wild type -260/- <dig> or the cold mutated -260/- <dig> as competitors. these data implied that the protein-dna complexes formed at - <dig> to - <dig> were nonspecific .

to investigate whether transcription factor sp <dig>  c-myc or e2f <dig> interacts with brd <dig> minimal promoter through their specific binding sites in vivo, we performed chip assay. because of the high gc content  in the region from - <dig> to - <dig> bp, it is very difficult to design the primers for amplifying of the sequence spanning - <dig> to - <dig> bp in chip assay. we designed the primers for amplification the sequence spanning - <dig> to - <dig> bp. as shown in the left panel of fig. 4b, with the dna samples immunoprecipitated in 5-8f cells by polyclonal rabbit antibodies against sp <dig> and c-myc as templates respectively, a  <dig> bp dna fragment of brd <dig> promoter could be amplified by using the indicated brd <dig> primers , but none by the primers of unrelated genomic region of gapdh gene . in contrast, no dna fragment of brd <dig> promoter could be amplified by using dna samples immunoprecipitated by anti-e2f <dig> as a template. a  <dig> bp dna fragment of brd <dig> promoter and a  <dig> bp unrelated genomic region of gapdh gene were amplified by using the input as templates. when dna samples immunoprecipitated with irrelevant anti-ha  were used as templates, no amplification occurred with either brd <dig> primers or gapdh primers. moreover, we did chip assays using nuclear protein isolated from 5-8f/si-c-myc cells. as shown in the right panel of fig. 4b, with the dna samples immunoprecipitated in 5-8f/si-c-myc cells by sp <dig> antibodies as templates, a  <dig> bp dna fragment of brd <dig> promoter could be amplified, whereas no dna fragment of brd <dig> promoter could be amplified by using dna samples immunoprecipitated in 5-8f/si-c-myc cells by anti-c-myc as templates. taking together, we concluded that transcription factor sp <dig> and c-myc specifically bind to brd <dig> minimal promoter.

role of the transcription factor sp <dig> in the regulation of brd <dig> promoter activity
to determine the role of sp <dig> in regulating brd <dig> minimal promoter, different amounts of expressing vector pcmv-ha/sp <dig> were co-transfected with promoter construct pgl3/- <dig> - <dig> into hne <dig> and 5-8f cells, respectively. as shown in fig. 5a, overexpression of sp <dig> slightly increases the promoter activity of pgl3-266/- <dig> in both hne <dig> and 5-8f cells. similar results were observed in cne <dig>  6-10b, mcf- <dig> and sw <dig> cells . is this due to the invalid sp <dig> binding site? to further confirm the sp <dig> binding site at position - <dig> to - <dig>  two mutated promoter constructs were created. construct sp1/myc-max/sm was generated by site mutation of three key nucleotides  of sp1/myc-max element, whereas sp1/myc-max/dm, was generated by deleting nine nucleotides of sp1/myc-max element . after transfection into 5-8f cells, both sp1/myc-max/sm and sp1/myc-max/dm exhibited the same low activity as compared to wild type pgl3/- <dig> - <dig>  in cos <dig> cells, wild type pgl3/- <dig> - <dig> showed strong promoter activity , but both sp1/myc-max/sm and sp1/myc-max/dm displayed substantially low promoter activity . all these data indicated that the sp1/myc-max element spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> bp is a positive regulatory element. mutating three key nucleotides of sp1/myc-max element was sufficient to abolish sp <dig> binding to this region and positively regulating of brd <dig> promoter activity.

c-myc inhibits the promoter activity and endogenous mrna expression of brd <dig> gene
to elucidate the effects of c-myc on regulating of brd <dig> minimal promoter, pgl3/- <dig> - <dig> and pgl3/- <dig> -212/gfp were co-transfected with various amounts of pcmv-ha/c-myc into cos <dig> cells, respectively. as shown in fig. 6a,  <dig>  Î¼g of pcmv-ha/c-myc was sufficient to completely inhibit the promoter activity of pgl3/- <dig> - <dig>  similarly, no direct gfp fluorescence was found in cells co-transfected with pgl3/- <dig> -212/gfp and pcmv-ha/c-myc , while strong direct gfp fluorescence was observed in cells co-transfected with pgl3/- <dig> -212/gfp and the control construct pcmv-ha . moreover, the suppressive role of c-myc in regulating of brd <dig> mrna expression was investigated by rt-pcr and real-time pcr. as shown in fig. 6c, obvious down-regulating of brd <dig> mrna expression was achieved by overexpression of c-myc in both cos <dig> and u <dig> cells as compared to overexpression of the control vector pcmv-ha. overexpression of c-myc decreased more than 43% of brd <dig> mrna expression in cos <dig> cells . all these data suggested that transcription factor c-myc could significantly suppress the promoter activity and endogenous mrna expression of brd <dig> gene.

knockdown of endogenous c-myc increases the promoter activity and mrna expression of brd <dig> gene
to further uncover the role of c-myc in negative regulation of brd <dig> expression, we employed dna vector-based sirna technology, by which small dna inserts encoding short hairpin rna against c-myc expression were cloned into prnat-u <dig>  vector, and named as prna-u <dig> /neo/c-myc. prna-u <dig> /neo empty vector was used as a negative control. prna-u <dig> /neo/c-myc and prna-u <dig> /neo were transfected into 5-8f cells to establish clone pool that stably expressing sirna against c-myc expression. as shown in fig. 7a, knockdown of c-myc decreased the protein expression of c-myc in 5-8f cells.

to identify the effects of knockdown of endogenous c-myc expression on brd <dig> promoter activity, the promoter construct pgl3/- <dig> - <dig> was transfected into either 5-8f/si-c-myc or 5-8f/si-control cells. as shown in fig. 7b, brd <dig> promoter activity increases ten folds in 5-8f/si-c-myc cells, indicating that knock-down of endogenous c-myc increases the promoter activity of brd <dig> gene.

we, next, examined the effect of knockdown of c-myc on endogenous brd <dig> expression. mrna expression level of brd <dig> gene detected in 5-8f/si-c-myc cells was higher than in 5-8f/si-control cells . the relative brd <dig> mrna level relative to gapdh mrna level was  <dig>  in 5-8f/si-c-myc cells as compared to  <dig>  in 5-8f/si-control cells . this indicates that knockdown of c-myc expression increased by 46% of the endogenous mrna expression of brd <dig> gene as compared to the parallel negative control.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
nasopharyngeal carcinoma  is a head and neck malignancy with high occurrence in south-east asia and southern china  <cit> . previous studies show that eb virus, environmental factors, and genetic susceptibility play important roles in the pathogenesis of npc  <cit> . brd <dig> is one of the genes identified from nasopharyngeal carcinoma  cells by cdna representational difference analysis   <cit> . it exhibited much higher-level of mrna expression in normal nasopharyngeal epithelia than in nasopharyngeal carcinoma  biopsies and cell lines  <cit> . however, little is known about its transcriptional regulation.

in this report, we defined the minimal promoter of brd <dig> gene in a  <dig> bp region, which is the shortest promoter identified so far in the regulatory region of brd <dig> gene. surprisingly, we found that this  <dig> bp region displayed high promoter activity in cos <dig>  hek <dig> and u <dig> cells, but exhibited extremely low activity in hne <dig>  cne <dig>  6-10b, 5-8f, mcf- <dig> and sw <dig> cells as compared to the full-length promoter -404/+ <dig>  what causes it? matinspector analysis revealed a myc-max, an e2f <dig> and a sp1/myc-max overlapping site in brd <dig> minimal promoter, suggesting that transcription factor e2f <dig>  c-myc and sp <dig> may be involved in regulating of brd <dig> minimal promoter.

sp <dig> is a well-investigated factor that regulates transcription through specific sequences in g/c-rich promoter regions and is often critical for transcriptional initiation of tata-less promoters  <cit> . brd <dig> gene contains a g/c rich promoter, in which there are several potential sp <dig> binding sites and no tata boxes. emsa along with chip assays confirmed a specific sp1/myc-max overlapping site spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> bp in brd <dig> minimal promoter. overexpression of sp <dig> slightly increased the activity of brd <dig> minimal promoter in npc hne <dig> and 5-8f cells. is it because of the invalid sp <dig> binding site? to end this point, two mutated promoter constructs including sp1/myc-max/sm and sp1/myc-max/dm were generated. the results showed that the sp1/myc-max overlapping site in the region from - <dig> to - <dig> bp is a positive regulatory element. mutating three key nucleotides of sp1/myc-max element was sufficient to abolish its positive regulation of brd <dig> promoter activity. these data confirmed the positively regulating role of sp1/myc-max site in brd <dig> promoter, on the other hand, inferred the possibility that the weakly positive role of sp <dig> may result from the influence of some negatively regulating factors.

c-myc is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor, and over-expressed in most human cancers  <cit> . c-myc executes its multiple activities mostly through transcriptional regulation of the target genes by binding to several hundred genomic loci harboring consensus c-myc binding sites, termed e-boxes, resulting in transcriptional activation of their adjacent genes  <cit> . additionally, a large number of genes such as cell cycle/growth arrest genes gas <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and gadd <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> are down-regulated by c-myc  <cit> . in our study, c-myc binds brd <dig> minimal promoter, and negatively regulates the promoter activity and endogenous mrna expression of brd <dig> gene. whereas knock-down of c-myc increases the promoter activity and mrna level of brd <dig> gene in npc 5-8f cells. from these findings, we concluded that c-myc is indeed a negative regulator of brd <dig> gene.

in conclusion, these studies showed several lines of evidences of brd <dig> transcriptional mechanisms:  c-myc expression is inversely corresponding to brd <dig> promoter activity.  sp <dig> binds to brd <dig> promoter and slightly positively regulates brd <dig> promoter activity.  c-myc binds to brd <dig> promoter and negatively regulates brd <dig> promoter activity and mrna expression. together these studies provide a molecular model for c-myc in suppressive regulation of brd <dig> promoter activity and mrna expression. these results will help to better understand the role of brd <dig> gene in signal-dependent transcriptional regulation and uncover the bio-functions of brd <dig> involved in the pathogenesis of npc as well as provide new potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy from the view of overexpression of brd <dig> and knock-down of c-myc gene.
