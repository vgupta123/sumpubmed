BACKGROUND
leukotrienes are key inflammatory mediators associated with pathological states of inflammation in diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis and play a pivotal role in normal host defense
 <cit> . they have been shown to promote leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, vascular tone and permeability, smooth muscle contractility and immune function. 5-lipoxygenase  is the key enzyme of leukotriene biosynthesis and so is a promising target for drug development
 <cit> .

5-lo is expressed predominantly in leukocytes and is responsible for the synthesis of both leukotriene a <dig>  and 5-hydroperoxy- <dig> ,1l,14--eicosatetraenoic acid 
 <cit> . the reaction scheme is given in figure
 <dig>  there are two steps in this reaction: oxygenation of arachidonic acid  using o <dig> to produce hp and the dehydration of the hydroperoxide intermediate, to produce the epoxide, leukotriene a <dig> . hp can be further converted either to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid  by glutathione peroxidase 
 <cit> . ht, in turn, can be converted to 5-oxo-6e,8z,11z,14z-eicosatetraenoic acid  by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase 
 <cit> . oxoete is produced by various cells including neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes
 <cit>  and acts as a potent chemo-attractant for these cell types. for example, 5oxoete stimulates eosinophil migration and tissue infiltration  <dig> fold more potently than leukotriene b <dig> 
 <cit> , and also increases intracellular calcium  concentration and actin polymerization in eosinophils
 <cit> . 

5-lo activity is controlled by the intracellular ca2+ concentration and the cellular redox state
 <cit> . the redox state modulates activity via the iron  atom located in the catalytic site of the enzyme. hp and other lipid peroxides are able to oxidize the fe atom from fe2+  to the active fe3+ . consistent with this the addition of glutathione peroxidase  inhibits formation of products of 5-lo catalyzed reactions in vitro <cit> . similar to other lipoxygenases, 5-lo also demonstrates redox state dependent hydroperoxidase activity
 <cit> : ferrous 5-lo reacts with lipid-hydroperoxide to form ferric 5-lo, an oxygen-centered lipid radical and hydroxide ion. additionally, 5-lo activity, in the presence of ca2+, is increased by structural stabilization via atp  without atp hydrolysis, microsomal membranes or phosphatidylcholine vesicles 
 <cit> . mitogen activated protein map kinase cascade activity, nuclear import and export of 5-lo, interaction with coactosin-like protein , 5-lo activating protein  and phosphorylation of the enzyme by protein kinase a, resulting in suppression of 5-lo activity, also have been reported to modulate it’s activity
 <cit> .

most of the known inhibitors of the 5-lo act on the basis of a redox-mechanism or by chelation of the fe atom of 5-lo
 <cit> . redox inhibitors reduce the fe atom from active ferric state to the inactive ferrous state. the complexity of 5-lo regulation and the multiple reaction paths suggests that redox and non-redox inhibitors may have qualitatively and quantitatively different effects on the products of 5-lo catalyzed reactions.

zileuton thien-2-ylethyl)-n-hydroxyurea or zyflo ir/cr®), is a redox inhibitor of 5-lo currently approved for the daily treatment of asthma in adults and children
 <cit> . zileuton has a sub-optimal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile resulting in a high total daily dose  and frequent dosing 
 <cit> , plus a potential for hepatotoxicity
 <cit> . therefore, the development of a medicine with more convenient dosing regimen may maximise the benefits of inhibiting the leukotriene pathway and provide efficacy superior to that obtained with zileuton. pf- <dig>  4-phenylthio)phenyl)-tetrahydro-2h-pyran-4-carboxamide , is a novel non-iron chelating, non-redox, 5-lo inhibitor under investigation for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions
 <cit> . the presence of significant data in the public domain for zileuton and pf suggested that development of a mathematical model would allow insight into the potential differential effects of non-redox and redox inhibitors. to characterize these potential effects it was necessary to attempt to capture the key properties of the entire pathway and its interactions in inflammatory states therefore, a detailed mathematical model, describing the processes of 5-lo mediated catalysis regulation  was developed.

several mathematical models of 5-lo have already been reported, for example a model describing the inhibition of lipoxygenase activity by one of the substrates of the enzyme, aa, by aharony et al.
 <cit> . in this model, 5-lo is able to bind  <dig> molecules of aa simultaneously  which renders the enzyme catalytically inactive. however, lta synthesis and the pseudo-peroxidase reaction have not been taken into account in this model. an alternative model of reticulocyte lipoxygenase was developed with  <dig> -octadecadienoic acid  as substrate
 <cit> . this model did take into account both the activation of the enzyme by product, hydroperoxy derivative of fatty acid, and inhibition of 5-lo with substrate, polienoic fatty acid. however, the substrate inhibition was described in terms of a competitive mechanism, binding to inactive form of 5-lo thus preventing its activation, and the lta <dig> synthase activity of the enzyme was not captured. additionally, none of the models describe the reversible inactivation of 5-lo with ht
 <cit>  and irreversible inactivation with lta4
 <cit> .

the rate laws for lipoxygenase and lta <dig> synthase reactions were derived by yang et al.
 <cit> , where the influence of various inhibitors of 5-lo and cyclooxygenase on aa metabolism were determined. these rate equations take into account the inhibition of 5-lo activity by lta <dig>  hp and ht. however, the inhibition with lta <dig> was also described as reversible and the substrate inhibition, product activation and pseudo-peroxidase activity of 5-lo were not taken into account.

therefore, an opportunity exists to develop a more detailed model of 5-lo activity which describes all the activities of the enzyme and their regulation by substrates and products. the main purpose of this paper is to summarize the development of a detailed mathematical model of 5-lo operation, its application to describe the production of lta <dig> and oxoete, and to study the differences between redox and non-redox inhibitors. the “los  model”  includes four enzymes: 5-lo, cytosolic phospholipase a <dig> , gpx and hedh and describes the major interactions between the components of the system . we used the “los model” to predict the dose-responses of various inflammatory mediators to redox and non-redox inhibitors and provide a mechanistic explanation for the differences between them.

methods
model construction
the “los model” describing lta <dig> and oxoete production in leukocytes includes reactions catalyzed by 5-lo, cpla <dig>  gpx, hedh and degradation of ht, oxoete and lta <dig>  since all leukotrienes are synthesized from lta <dig>  analysis of 5-lo catalyzed lta <dig> production was deemed sufficient to evaluate the impact of 5-lo on leukotriene production. catalytic cycles for each of the enzymes were constructed and rate equations describing the dependence of reaction rate on concentrations of substrates, products and effectors were derived utilizing literature data.

the kinetic model of 5-lo
known experimental data and hypotheses used for the model development
in this study, we used the following available experimental data and facts on structural and functional properties of 5-lo:

 <dig>  aa inhibits 5-lo activity in lipoxygenase reaction at high concentrations 
 <cit> .

 <dig>  lta <dig> can be synthesized from exogenous hp
 <cit> .

 <dig>  5-lo is self-inactivating
 <cit> . glutathione peroxidase and glutathione protect the enzyme from inactivation and lipid peroxides eliminate the protective effect of glutathione.

 <dig>  ht is a reversible inhibitor of 5-lo
 <cit> .

 <dig>  lta <dig> can inactivate 5-lo irreversibly
 <cit> .

 <dig>  the fe atom in the catalytic site exists in two possible states fe2+ and fe3+. fe3+ is the catalytically active state. transition between fe2+ and fe3+ states proceeds via oxidation by lipid peroxides, including hp
 <cit> . reduction from fe3+ to fe2+ state can be mediated by redox inhibitors .

 <dig>  oxidation of the enzyme  is influenced by ca2+ ions
 <cit> .

 <dig>  endogenously generated 5-hp is the preferential substrate for the 5-lo mediated lta-synthase reaction
 <cit> .

 <dig>  atp and membrane binding are necessary for 5-lo activation
 <cit> .

during model building and simplification, the following assumptions were made:

a. there are two sites for aa binding: the catalytic site and regulatory site. ht is a competitive inhibitor at the catalytic site.

b. binding of aa to the regulatory site results in formation of dead-end complexes with 5-lo.

c. binding of aa and ht to the catalytic site are fast reactions in comparison to product formation.

d. oxidation and reduction of 5-lo  can result from  interaction with lipid peroxides or  “spontaneously” .

e. ca2+ is able to bind to the catalytic site, but it influences only oxidation and reduction reactions, thus kinetic parameters of other reactions of catalytic cycle remain unchanged.

f. binding of ca2+ and redox-inhibitors  are fast reactions in comparison to the other reactions of the catalytic cycle.

g. redox inhibitors are only able to bind to the catalytic site of 5-lo and only when it is not occupied with other factors.

h. the binding of redox inhibitors to the catalytic site blocks the binding of other factors .

i. the regulatory site is able to bind aa only if following conditions are fulfilled:  5-lo is in fe3+ state and  the enzyme is not bound to a redox-inhibitor.

j. the oxygenase, pseudoperoxydase and lta <dig> synthase activities of 5-lo were simplified by not describing electron transfer and oxygen binding. instead, it was assumed that the oxygen concentration is in saturation, i.e., it is not a parameter of the model.

k. to decrease the number of unknown parameters in our model we have assumed that binding of aa to the regulatory site of 5-lo does not influence the binding of aa, hp and ht to the catalytic site .

l. interaction with map kinases, flap, clp and transport of 5-lo to the nucleus have not been taken into account in the model.

catalytic cycle of 5-lo
figure
 <dig> shows schematic representation of the enzyme states considered in the model. in the ferric state 5-lo is able to bind any substrates/products/inhibitors at its catalytic and regulatory sites. this state of 5-lo was represented as a square with a triangle underneath the square. the square designates the catalytic site of the enzyme and the triangle represents the regulatory site. the regulatory site can be found in  <dig> states: free or aa bound. the catalytic site of 5-lo is able to bind aa, ht, hp, pf , z . as an example figure
 <dig> shows the ht and aa bound enzyme state. all the above mentioned compounds compete for the substrate binding part of the catalytic site. in addition to the substrate/product  and competitive inhibitors  the catalytic site of 5-lo is able to bind ca2+ ) which does not compete with aa, ht, hp, pf and z. therefore, the catalytic site of the ferric enzyme can be found in a total of  <dig> states: free of any substrate/competitor and with aa, ht, hp, pf, z bound all of which can be found with and without ca2+ bound. on the basis of this analysis we can conclude that catalytic cycle of 5-lo includes  <dig> potential states . the ferrous state  of 5-lo is not able to bind any substrate/product/inhibitor at the catalytic or regulatory site but it is able to bind ca2+ at the catalytic site ). thus, total catalytic cycle includes  <dig> states of 5-lo. since in derivation of the rate equations describing 5-lo activities we have used new variables representing sums of states of 5-lo, notations for such sums have also been introduced ). in the equations and text of this paper we have used the simplified notations of the 5-lo states .

transitions between the states are described in accordance to mass action law and can be either reversible  or irreversible . moreover, these processes can be either relatively fast or slow depending on the values of rate constants obtained from experimental data fitting. this grouping of all processes into two sets  allowed us to reduce the initial complexity of the catalytic cycle and derive rate equations describing the operation of 5-lo according to the methods described in
 <cit> .

schematic visualization of the total catalytic cycle is not convenient because of the complexity . to reconstruct a reduced total catalytic cycle and derive rate equations we employed a step-by-step strategy described in additional file
1: appendix  <dig>  as a result we have developed a reduced catalytic cycle  describing oxygenation, dehydration and pseudoperoxidase activities of 5-lo. on the basis of this reduced catalytic cycle, we have derived rate equations  describing 5-lo mediated aa consumption , 5-hp production in oxygenase reaction , ht production and hp consumption in pseudoperoxidase reaction , all other lipid peroxide  consumption in pseudoperoxidase reaction  and lta <dig> production :

since 5-lo undergoes irreversible inactivation, the concentration of active enzyme tends to zero with time and, consequently, all enzyme catalyzed reactions become equal to zero. in vivo, regulatory mechanisms control intracellular 5-lo production de novo <cit> . to obtain non-zero steady state concentrations of 5-lo states and, consequently, to derive the rate equations describing the activities of 5-lo, we did not consider self-inactivation of the enzyme and have not taken into account processes responsible for 5-lo production de novo. under these assumptions the total concentration of active enzyme  is equal to total enzyme concentration and fa is a parameter of the model. additionally, identification of model parameters using in vitro experimental data was performed on the basis of a model which takes into account self-inactivation of 5-lo with time . under these conditions fa represents the sum of active states of 5-lo and changes with time. all rate equations were derived on the basis of the quasi-steady state approach

the kinetic model of phospholipase a2
calcium-dependent phospholipase a <dig>  catalyzes the production of aa from phospholipids  in the cell membrane. elevations in the cellular calcium concentration significantly stimulate cpla <dig> activity. on the basis of several models of the enzyme developed previously and available experimental data

the lta <dig> and oxoete synthesis model 
to build the “los model” we utilized the rate equations describing the activities of 5-lo, phospholipase a <dig>  glutathione peroxidase and 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase as given above. the kinetic scheme of the “los model” is shown in figure
 <dig>  in accordance with the scheme, aa binding to 5-lo is converted to hp via the lipoxygenase reaction. as a result a complex of 5-lo and hp is formed. hp can be either released from the complex  or used to form lta <dig> via the lta4-synthase reaction vltasyn5lo. additionally, lta <dig> can be produced from free hp in the absence of aa . to present all these process correctly the intermediate state of the enzyme fhp  was added to the kinetic scheme. the concentration of the state fhp is not a variable of the model, i.e. there are no differential equations describing the time dynamics of fhp. however, in accordance with the quasi-steady state approach chosen to describe 5-lo operation in the “los model”  concentration of state fhp is expressed in terms of variables of the “los model” .

to avoid unlimited accumulation of metabolites resulting from constant influx of aa we have introduced processes of degradation of ht, oxoete and lta <dig>  in the model. the reaction rates of these processes are described in accordance with mass action law . additionally, concentrations of pl, lipid peroxide looh and its reduced product loh, reduced  and oxidized  glutathione, and reduced and oxidized forms of nadph are considered as parameters of the model, i.e., do not change with time. the values for the intracellular concentrations of gsh, gssg, nadph and nadp were taken from the following sources
 <cit> . the concentration of looh has either been chosen on the basis of known experimental conditions or has been varied to describe various oxidative states of the cells.

based on all the above assumptions the system of differential equations describing the “los model” is presented below:

  daadt=vaapla2−vaacons5lo 

  dhpdt=vhpsyn5lo−vhpcons5lo−vgpx 

  dhtdt=vhpcons5lo+vgpx−vhedh−vhtd 

  dlta4dt=vltasyn5lo−vltad 

  doxoetedt=vhedh−voxoeted 

description of the parameters of the “los model” and experimental data used for their identification
according to assumption l of the section “known experimental data and hypotheses used for the model development”, some parameters were equated with each other . thus, for 5-lo  <dig> independent parameters remained, among them  <dig> equilibrium constants and  <dig> rate constants. additionally,  <dig> parameters for gpx, and  <dig> parameters for hedh needed to be identified. several of the values of the parameters have been directly taken from other literature sources- e.g. the michaelis constant for glutathione  for glutathione peroxidase reaction
 <cit> , the rate constant of lta <dig> and ht degradation
 <cit> . the values for other parameters were chosen on the basis of the best coincidence between modeling results and corresponding experimental data. to select the values of the parameters we used the algorithm of fitting based on the hook-jeeves method
 <cit>  implemented in the dbsolve optimum package
 <cit> . as a criterion of fitness, the following function was used:

  fkj,kj,=∑invi−v¯i <dig> 

here, n is the total number of experimental points,
iv¯ is the experimentally measured value of the variable or reaction rate, vi is the value of the variable or reaction rate calculated based on the model at a point corresponding to the experimental ones.

given the complexity of the model, simultaneous identification of parameter estimates would be challenging. therefore, parameter identification was performed individually for each enzyme by fitting to literature data sets pertinent to the specific enzyme. for example, the parameters of 5-lo were identified via fitting of the 5-lo model against more than  <dig> experimentally measured curves 
 <cit> ,  <dig> unknown parameters of gpx were identified on the basis of  <dig> experimentally measured points
 <cit>  and the parameters of hedh have been fitted against  <dig> experimental points
 <cit> .

RESULTS
modeling of 5-lo kinetics
the “los model” and parameter values identified during model building enabled us to reproduce various experimental data on the kinetics of 5-lo. due to the large number of fits only selected representative examples are presented in the main text. the values of the parameters obtained are given in table
 <dig>  figure
 <dig> demonstrates a model generated curve fitted to the experimentally measured dependencies of hp production rate on aa
 <cit> . based on this it was concluded that the model of 5-lo satisfactorily described the observed non-monotonic behavior. figure
 <dig> demonstrates the simulated time series of total concentration of hp and ht fitted to literature data
 <cit> . additionally, our model satisfactorily fitted experimental data on lta <dig> production from endogenous and exogenous hp 
 <cit>  and the ca2+ dependence of 5-hp production by 5-lo on ca2+ concentration
 <cit> . in the latter example the model satisfactorily reproduced both the ec <dig> value  and the non-monotonic shape of the experimentally measured dependence . other results of fitting are summarized in additional file
1: appendix  <dig>  
 <cit> . dots correspond to experimental data; solid line is model generated curve.
 <cit> , line correspond to results of calculations.

the next step of model evaluation examined its ability to reproduce experimentally measured data which had not been used for parameter identification. as an example we selected a dataset describing the influence of glutathione on 5-lo. in accordance with the experimental data
 <cit> , the effect of glutathione on 5-lo products in a cell-free extract strongly depends on the concentration of aa. under conditions of low aa concentrations, the reaction rate of 5-lo is inversely proportional to the glutathione concentration. when aa concentration is high, the rate of 5-lo catalyzed reactions do not decrease even at high concentrations of gsh. figure
 <dig> demonstrates that our “los model” satisfactorily reproduces this threshold influence of gsh on the total concentration of “5-lo metabolites”  at various concentrations of aa. our model explains this phenomenon  as driven by the lack of lipid peroxides in this cell-free extract system under conditions of low aa concentrations. in this case the main agent responsible for 5-lo oxidation is hp . hp acts as an electron acceptor in the pseudo-peroxidase reaction converting 5-lo from inactive  to active  state. under conditions of low aa concentrations, 5-lo is unable to produce a sufficient quantity of hp molecules to drive the transition of the enzyme to active form. additionally data from experiments with pmn homogenates
 <cit>  demonstrated that the addition of gsh can, however, suppress the activation of 5-lo, as long as the aa concentration remains below a critical limit. 

modeling of the response to redox and non-redox inhibitors of 5-lo
we applied the “los model” to study the influences of redox and non-redox inhibitors on the operation of 5-lo. inhibitor pf has been profiled in stimulated human whole blood  against several relevant human targets including 5-lo, 12-lox, 15-lo and cox enzymes
 <cit> . the compound completely inhibited the synthesis of the 5-lo products  with estimated ic50s between  <dig> and  <dig> nm. these data demonstrate that the non-redox inhibitor pf is 6– <dig> times more potent than zileuton.

the mechanism of 5-lo inhibition by the redox and non-redox inhibitors has been modeled under lta <dig> steady-state concentration . parameter values describing the kinetic properties of redox and non-redox 5-lo inhibitors were chosen in such a way to provide satisfactory coincidence between the ic <dig> and ic <dig> measured experimentally
 <cit>  and those calculated by the “los model”.

to validate the model describing 5-lo we again utilized comparison of test data sets to simulated outcomes. examples of such “independent” data sets were

 time dependences of hp and ht measured at various zileuton concentrations in in vitro experiments with 5-lo
 <cit> .

 time dependences of peroxides measured in the presence and absence of pf and zileuton in ex vivo experiments
 <cit> .

figure
 <dig> demonstrates that the derived values of parameters  for zileuton on 5-lo allowed the model to satisfactorily reproduce experimentally measured production of the sum of hp and ht
 <cit> . moreover, the “los model” qualitatively reproduced experimental kinetic data describing the application of redox and non-redox inhibitors in vitro. experiments in a crude cell lysates 5-lo system containing  <dig> μm of peroxide -hpode) examined the addition of  <dig> μm of zileuton or pf . the “los model” satisfactory reproduced peroxide consumption following zileuton, and the absence of effect following pf application  due to its non-redox mechanism
 <cit> . 
 <cit> . other concentrations:  <dig> μm of aa,  <dig>  mm of ca.
 <dig> 

thus, comparison of the model simulations to two sets of experimental data which were not used in parameter identification enabled us to conclude that our model adequately described the influence of inhibitors on the system behavior.

difference between redox and non-redox inhibitors
as have already been discussed earlier, the redox state of the cell  is able to significantly influence 5-lo activity. in the “los model” different levels of oxidative stress were described in terms of looh . to predict system responses to redox and non-redox inhibitors and to identify possible differences between them at different levels of looh we simulated the dependence of steady state lta <dig> and oxoete on pf and zileuton concentration. several looh concentrations were chosen for this study:  <dig> Âµm ,  <dig> Âµm ,  <dig> Âµm  and  <dig> Âµm . for all simulations the system was run to steady-state conditions with subsequent addition of inhibitor and the effect at the new steady-state noted. this was represented as the percentage of inhibition of lta <dig> and oxoete at a given inhibitor concentration and was calculated using the following equations:

  inh%lta4=1001−lta4stinhlta4stinh= <dig> 

  inh%oxoete=1001−oxoetestinhoxoetestinh= <dig> 

where lta4stinh, oxoetestinh,are steady-state concentrations of lta <dig> and oxoete at a specified inhibitor concentration lta4stinh =  <dig>  oxoetestinh =  <dig> are steady-state concentrations of lta <dig> and oxoete in the absence of inhibitor.

we have simulated how the lta <dig> and oxoete dose response depends on the looh level and found that both were influenced significantly . indeed, assuming looh level equal to  <dig>  we have simulated how steady state concentrations of lta <dig> and oxoete depend on zileuton and pf compound concentrations . figure
 <dig> demonstrates that model fits satisfactorily ex vivo experimental data
 <cit>  on the dependence of lta <dig> and oxoete on pf concentration . the solid lines on figures
 <dig> also show that the potency of zileuton to inhibit oxoete production is the same as for lta <dig> production, but it is ten times lower than the potency of pf compound to inhibit both rates . 

*- corresponds to healthy subjects.

** - corresponds to asthmatic subjects.
 <dig> 
 <dig> 

assuming a level of looh in healthy controls of  <dig> Âµm ) we have found that curves describing level of inhibition of lta <dig> and oxoete show a similar tendency but in case of inhibition with zileuton a new feature was observed. the increase in looh level from  <dig> to  <dig> Âµm was accompanied by a decrease in zileuton potency for inhibition of oxoete synthesis  in comparison with its potency to inhibit lta <dig> synthesis . this effect is more pronounced when setting the  equal to  <dig> Âµm . to further illustrate this effect we simulated the impact of a supra-physiological looh concentration of  <dig> Âµm on the inhibitory properties of compounds .

discussion of redox-inhibitor properties at high oxidative stress
zileuton donates an electron to the active  state of 5-lo to form the inactive ferrous  state and a zileuton radical . the zileuton radical is eliminated without subsequent reduction to zileuton
 <cit> . to activate 5-lo it is necessary to oxidize the inactive ferrous  state, i.e. an electron donated to an acceptor such as hp or looh. therefore, under conditions of low looh only hp is able to oxidize 5-lo. if zileuton is applied, 5-lo is converted to the inactive ferrous state, the rate of hp synthesis decreases and, as a consequence, the enzyme is completely inhibited because of lack of its oxidation. in the absence of other sources of lipid peroxides and hp, 5-lo is completely inhibited by zileuton.

under conditions of high looh, the transformation of ferrous 5-lo state into ferric state can proceed in two possible ways: either via hp or looh reduction . when zileuton is applied, the concentration of ferrous state of 5-lo increases. however, high level of looh may compensate for the lack of hp in the pseudo-peroxidase reaction that leads to maintenance of level of the active 5-lo state and, as a consequence, the lipoxygenase reaction occurs. under these conditions the rate of pseudo-peroxidase reaction increases and both hp and looh are reduced in this reaction converting 5-lo into active ferric state. as a consequence of increased hp consumption in the pseudo-peroxidase reaction, its concentration decreases, leading to a decrease in lta <dig> production. at the same time increases in ht concentration produced in the pseudo-peroxidase reaction leads to further increase in oxoete production.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a model of 5-lo activity and regulation that demonstrates emergent properties consistent with a wide range of experimental data. utilizing this model we have derived several conclusions:

i) both redox and non-redox inhibitors of 5-lo decrease lta <dig> production independently of lipid peroxide level.

ii) non-redox inhibitors of 5-lo decrease ht production  independently of lipid peroxide level.

iii) the effect of redox inhibitors on oxoete production strongly depends on looh level;

iv) redox inhibition of 5-lo under condition of high looh switches 5-lo from lta <dig> production to ht  production.

oxoete is one of the key inflammatory mediators and the results of our work presented in the paper have demonstrated that under certain conditions redox inhibitors can lead to a non-intuitive increase in oxoete synthesis. together with the pk disadvantages of zileuton this observation supports the further investigation of non-redox inhibitors as possible drugs against asthma.
