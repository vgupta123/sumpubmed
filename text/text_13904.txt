BACKGROUND
arylamine n-acetyltransferases  are xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes found in a wide range of species across all major clades of life , except plants  <cit> . this unique family of enzymes catalyses the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme a  to the terminal nitrogen of arylamine, hydrazine and heterocyclic amine compounds. biochemical, structural and functional studies of the last decades have increased our understanding of the potentially diverse roles of nats in endogenous and xenobiotic metabolism, establishing their key role in cellular homeostasis as well as in gene-environment interactions  <cit> .

humans have two functional nat genes  and one pseudogene , located within  <dig> kilobases  on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . both nat <dig> and nat <dig> genes have intronless coding regions with a single coding exon of  <dig> base pairs  that produces a  <dig> amino acid  protein. they share 81% nucleotide identity, which translates to 87% identity at the amino acid level. the pseudogene natp displays high sequence identity to nat <dig> and nat <dig>  but contains multiple frameshift and premature stop codon mutations leading to loss of function  <cit> . despite their high degree of sequence identity, nat <dig> and nat <dig> encode isoenzymes with distinct substrate specificities, tissue distribution and expression levels during development. nat <dig> is widely expressed in most tissues and cell types and preferentially acetylates substrates such as p-aminobenzoic acid , p-aminosalicylic acid  and p-aminobenzoylglutamate . nat <dig> has a more restricted expression profile, being predominantly expressed in the liver, small intestine and colon, and prefers bulkier substrates such as sulphamethazine, isoniazid, procainamide, and dapsone . the widespread tissue distribution of nat <dig>  its selectivity for pabg as well as its early expression in development , have suggested that nat <dig> may have an endogenous role in addition to the metabolism of xenobiotics. acetylating the folate breakdown product pabg is now generally accepted to be an endogenous role of this enzyme which might be important in normal embryonic development  <cit> . the importance of nat <dig> and nat <dig> in the metabolism of drugs and in the activation of common environmental carcinogens has led to a plethora of molecular epidemiological studies that have shown associations of nat gene polymorphisms with individual drug response and susceptibility to cancers linked to arylamine exposure  <cit> .

because of their role in the detoxification of exogenous chemicals present in the diet and the environment, human nat <dig> and nat <dig> genes have long been considered as likely targets of population-specific selective pressures, a hypothesis further fuelled by the intriguing patterns of geographic differentiation of their major alleles  <cit> . in particular, the nat <dig> gene, which exhibits a well established acetylation polymorphism leading to a phenotype classification of individuals into rapid and slow acetylators, has been the subject of numerous studies examining its nucleotide sequence variation in a wide range of ethnically diverse populations and determining the role of natural selection in shaping genetic variation at this locus. several surveys provided clear evidence for a correlation between the prevalence of slow acetylators in human populations and the subsistence strategy adopted by their ancestors in the last  <dig>  years, suggesting that a slower rate of acetylation may have provided a selective advantage in populations shifting from foraging to pastoralism/agriculturalism in the neolithic period  <cit> . it is thus currently held that the neolithic transition triggered significant changes in dietary exposure to environmental chemicals that modified the selective regime affecting the nat <dig> acetylation pathway. likewise, and more generally, considering the temporal fluctuations in the kinds and levels of environmentally available xenobiotic compounds over evolutionary time, the metabolic function of nats is likely to be under adaptive evolution and the nat genes could be broadening or changing substrate specificity in response to changing environmental conditions. yet, in contrast to the numerous population genetic studies carried out for human polymorphic nat genes, no study to date has investigated the role of positive selection in the expansion and functional diversification of the nat genetic loci at a deeper evolutionary time scale.

the aim of the present work was to thoroughly examine the molecular evolutionary history of the nat gene family during the last ~ <dig> million years. a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> nat homologous nucleotide sequences from  <dig> vertebrate species retrieved from genomic databases was used to determine the likely contribution of gene duplication, gene conversion and positive selection to the evolutionary dynamics of this family. a special emphasis was put on the study of the last ~ <dig> million years of primate nat evolution by determining the nat coding sequences in  <dig> additional primate species. the results of this work greatly improved our understanding of the evolutionary regime that has shaped the nat protein-coding sequence: it allowed us to clarify the paralogous and orthologous relationships among the nat genes in vertebrate species, date the gene-duplication events giving rise to the human nat gene family, and identify episodes of adaptive evolution at specific sites and domains of the protein.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate nat sequences
to study the molecular evolution of the nat gene family in vertebrates, we retrieved all available nat-homologous sequences from public genomic databases and compiled a dataset of  <dig> nat coding sequences from  <dig> species representing all major vertebrate taxa . these  <dig> sequences included  <dig> full-length open reading frames  with sizes ranging from  <dig> to 870 bp and  <dig> partial coding sequences containing  <dig> to  <dig> missing nucleotides. in most species, we identified one or two distinct nat sequences but in some others, up to five functional nat genes were found . a second nat sequence was identified in dipodomys ordii and vicugna pacos but the corresponding orfs were missing  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively, so they were not included in the final dataset. no nat-like sequences were found in the current assembly of the dog genome , confirming the previous findings of trepanier and colleagues  <cit>  who were unable to detect nat homologues in any of  <dig> domestic dogs and  <dig> wild canids studied. the proportion of sequence identity to human nat <dig> varied from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  at the nucleotide level. the alignment result of the  <dig> nucleotide sequences is provided in additional file  <dig>  three sequences showed a 3-bp insertion at positions 385– <dig> resulting in an additional amino acid in the protein , while eleven sequences from seven species carried a deletion of either  <dig>   <dig> or 9 bp, resulting in a loss of either  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> contiguous amino acids. in all sequences, the three residues composing the ‘cys-his-asp’ catalytic triad , which is essential to the nat enzymatic activity, were conserved, indicating that the encoded enzymes are likely to be functional.

a maximum-likelihood  phylogeny was constructed with phyml using the nat coding nucleotide alignment . this phylogeny was largely congruent with the currently accepted phylogeny of vertebrate species at the class  and order  levels. in most species carrying more than one functional nat gene, the paralogs were more similar to each other than the corresponding orthologs, suggesting multiple species-specific gene duplication events. one exception concerns the sequences of the mouse and rat species which cluster into three paralog groups nat <dig>  nat <dig> and nat <dig>  suggesting that the three genes were present before the divergence of the two rodent species. this may also be the case for the syrian and chinese hamsters , whose genomes have not been sequenced yet and which may harbor three functional genes as well. another exception involves the catarrhine species  where a single duplication event probably occurred in the common ancestor of these species giving rise to the human nat <dig> and nat <dig> homologous genes. the tree also suggests that two duplication events prior to the divergence of species also occurred in the aves clade. besides these exceptions, our phylogenetic analysis indicates that lineage- and species-specific gene duplications are widespread in the evolutionary history of the nat gene family, so that most nat genes in vertebrates are the products of recent gene duplication events.

however, some aspects of the sequence divergence patterns observed in the tree might also be attributed to concerted evolution via interparalog gene conversion which homogenizes the sequences of different members of a gene family within a genome. this would explain why different nat paralogs within a species  cluster together in the tree. to detect and characterize putative recombination events among nat genes, we used six different methods designed to pinpoint recombination break-points and define gene conversion tracts . by combining the results of all six methods, a total of eight recombination events were detected affecting seven nat paralog pairs in seven species ; only four of them were detected by at least two different algorithms. in view of the inferred phylogenetic relationships among nat sequences , the detected conversion events could explain the preferential clustering of nat paralogs in the danio rerio, oryzias latipes, echinops telfairi and myotis lucifugus species. however, when removing all the regions affected by gene conversion from the nucleotide alignment , exactly the same topology was obtained in the resulting tree , with nearly identical bootstrap values . this suggests that gene conversion is unlikely to have confounded the analysis and that concerted evolution has only played a minor role  in the patterns of divergence of nat sequences in vertebrates. overall, our results indicate that the nat gene family has undergone rapid evolution with frequent gene duplications and losses  throughout vertebrate evolution even among closely related species.

a breakpoint positions refer to the nt positions in the full alignment of the vertebrate nat sequences. they may slightly vary depending on the method used to detect recombinant sequences, leading to different gene conversion tract lengths.

b in cases where multiple methods detected the same or a similar conversion event, we reported the p-value range, i.e. the worst and the best p-value; the method yielding the best p-value is shown in bold. otherwise, only the p-value of the single algorithm detecting a conversion event is presented.

this scenario is further supported by the fine-scale synteny data retrieved for several vertebrate species in an extended region encompassing the nat genes locus. the dynamic pattern of gene duplication and loss is robustly apparent in comparing the human and mouse genomes, which are especially mature in sequence and annotation . although both the human and mouse nat clusters are composed of three loci located in homologous regions of chromosome  <dig> , no one-to-one ortholog relationships could be defined because of the presence of a predicted pseudogene not related to nat sequences between the mouse nat <dig> and nat <dig> genes and the total loss of shared synteny on the telomeric side of the clusters. combined with the phylogenetic relationships inferred in the ml tree , these data rather support a scenario where the human and mouse syntenic gene clusters have originated from a shared ancestral gene or genes, with repeated local gene duplications and losses giving rise to lineage-specific groups of related genes . as a further illustration, the genomic sequences of the three bird species studied were similarly compared . an extended region of conserved fine-scale synteny encompasses the chicken , turkey  and zebra finch  nat genes, confirming that the nat paralogs of these species share a common genomic history. both the chromosomal location and patterns of clustering of avian nat sequences support the existence of three nat genes  before the split of the three bird species. thus, the three paralogous nat <dig>  nat <dig> and nat <dig> sequences within each species likely result from the same tandem gene duplication events occurring in the common ancestor to these species. while no further gene duplication event apparently occurred in turkey, additional duplications of ancestral nat <dig> sequences happened independently in the genomes of chicken and zebra finch, giving rise to chicken nat <dig> and zebra finch nat <dig> and nat <dig>  respectively. these data further demonstrate the complex history of duplications of the nat gene family, with many cases of recent gene duplications occurring independently in specific lineages.

maximum-likelihood analysis of selective pressures in vertebrate nat sequences
since some aspects of nat evolution are likely driven by xenobiotic exposure, we investigated the possible role of natural selection in the evolutionary history of this gene family. to test for evidence of positive selection acting at specific sites of the nat coding region or along particular branches of the phylogenetic tree, a series of nested likelihood ratio tests  using different sets of site-specific and branch-specific models were carried out using the codeml program of the paml package  <cit>  . when applied to the dna codon alignment of the full vertebrate dataset , lrts of site-specific models indicated both varying ω ratio among sites  and positive selection at a small subset of sites , indicating that the nat coding region has evolved under diversifying selection in vertebrates. log-likelihood values showed that m <dig> was the model that best fitted the data. this model showed that 5% of the sites were under positive selection with an average estimated ω ratio of  <dig> . the bayes empirical bayes  analysis identified four sites under positive selection with high posterior probabilities  under m <dig> : residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the first three of which are involved in acetyl-coa  binding  <cit> . likewise, the free-ratio model implemented in paml, which allows an independent assignment of ω ratios to each evolutionary branch, gave a significantly better fit to the data than the one-ratio model m <dig>  thus suggesting lineage-specificity of ω . out of the  <dig> branches of the analyzed phylogeny,  <dig> branches  showed evidence of positive selection , with the highest ω values for branches d, e, k, n, o, and p . interestingly, four branches with evidence of positive selection clustered in the pteropus vampyrus nats clade . detailed analysis of the patterns of nucleotide substitutions along the four branches leading to the three paralogous nat sequences found in this bat species revealed a striking pattern of accelerated amino acid evolution due to positive selection: as many as  <dig> different nonsynonymous changes affecting the nat protein-coding sequence occurred within this single clade . it is noteworthy that nearly half  of these nonsynonymous changes are located either in the interdomain region of the protein, which contains several residues involved in substrate and cofactor binding , or in the c-terminal region, which has a major role in arylamine substrate specificity   <cit> . given that positive selection often operates only on a few amino acid sites along particular branches, we employed branch-site models  to detect whether some sites along particular branches of the phylogeny are under positive selection. since the subset of branches to be tested has to be specified a priori and independently of the results of the branch-specific test, we decided to focus on those branches defining the major taxonomic groups of the vertebrate phylogeny, numbered from b <dig> to b <dig> . four of these branches, leading to fishes , avian nat2/nat3/nat4/nat <dig> sequences , mammals  and rodents , showed evidence of positive selection at the non-corrected threshold of  <dig> . only the two formers remained significant after correction for multiple testing. two sites were identified by the beb analysis as positively selected : codon  <dig>  along the lineage leading to avian nat2/nat3/nat4/nat <dig> sequences and codon  <dig>  along the lineage leading to rodents. when branch-site tests were performed at the clade level , only lizard sequences provided significant results , which persisted after correction for multiple testing. in this clade, two codons were identified as positively selected:  <dig>  and  <dig> . note that the four sites identified by the branch-site tests  are in addition to those identified with site-specific models.

when restricting the analysis to the  <dig> mammalian sequences of the vertebrate data set, similar results were obtained. model m <dig> provided the best fit to the data with  <dig> % of sites having a positive ω of  <dig>  . the same codons were pinpointed to be under positive selection with pp ≥ 95%, plus an additional site located in the acetyl-coa binding pocket . however, when the analysis was restricted to the  <dig> primate sequences, no significant evidence of positive selection was detected , neither at the site nor at the branch level. this suggests either that the selective pressure that recurrently drove positive selection of vertebrate nats became relaxed in the primate lineage, or that the statistical power provided by the small number of sequences available for analysis may be insufficient to get significant results when performing the lrt tests implemented in paml. these tests have indeed been shown to lack power when data contain only few numbers of slightly divergent sequences  <cit> . in such a case, sampling a larger number of lineages is considered as the best way to improve the accuracy and power of lrts and has been shown to cause a spectacular rise in power, even when sequence divergence is low  <cit> . therefore, we sought to gain power by determining the nat coding sequences in  <dig> additional primate species, bringing up to  <dig> the number of species available for analysis in the primate clade.

nat sequence evolution and analysis of selective pressures in the primate lineage
a more thorough investigation of the evolutionary history of the nat gene family was conducted in primates by extending the analysis to  <dig> additional primate species  in which nat nucleotide sequences were determined for the first time. two functional nat genes were found in all  <dig> species, whereas a third nat sequence, abolished by frameshift mutations and highly similar to the human pseudogene natp, was found in ten of them. in all, the full primate data set comprised  <dig> nucleotide sequences from  <dig> primate species, including  <dig> database sequences and  <dig> newly generated ones. whereas functional sequences were all of the same length , pseudogene sequences displayed considerable length variation due to the significant number of indels disrupting nat orf , resulting in a multiple alignment of  <dig> sites . these indels involve both single and multiple nucleotides. all natp sequences have in common a single 1-bp deletion in position  <dig>  which is likely to be the first frameshift mutation that occurred in the ancestral natp coding sequence.

the ml tree built using phyml support monophyletic strepsirrhini, simiiformes , platyrrhini, catarrhini, cercopithecoidea and hominidea clades . in simiiformes, nat genes clearly cluster into three paralog groups, all strongly supported  and regrouping sequences orthologous to human nat <dig>  nat <dig> and natp. the paralog group of nat <dig> sequences displays the highest level of nucleotide sequence identity , followed by nat <dig>  and natp . the accelerated evolution of the natp pseudogene is clearly apparent from the long branch leading to this clade, probably reflecting relaxed purifying selection subsequent to the loss of protein functionality. contrary to the two functional genes, natp sequences were obtained only in catarrhine species. hence, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three human nat genes emerged from a first duplication event in the common ancestor of simiiformes, yielding nat <dig> and an ancestral nat gene which in turn, duplicated in the common ancestor of catarrhini, eventually giving rise to nat <dig> and natp. the absence of natp in one of the hylobatidae species  can be explained either by the loss of this gene  in this species or by a substantial divergence of this sequence from its related orthologs, hampering its effective amplification. obviously, we cannot exclude the possibility that similar reasons may explain the absence of natp in platyrrhine species. however, the high number of trials performed  make this possibility unlikely and rather support a true absence of the pseudogene in platyrrhini and hylobates lar.

the phylogenetic analysis also demonstrates that nat <dig> and nat <dig> paralogs found in microcebus murinus and tarsius syrichta are the result of independent gene duplication events that occurred after the divergence of these species from the simian lineage and after the divergence of strepsirrhini and tarsiiformes. because no gene conversion was detected with any of the six recombination detection methods for any pair of sequences in the primate dataset, we can exclude concerted evolution as a possible explanation for the greater similarity of nat paralogs within m. murinus and t. syrichta species. otolemur garnetti is the only primate species with a single nat gene identified. however, genomic coverage is still limited  for this species and we cannot exclude that additional nat copies may exist in its genome.

next, we investigated the role of positive selection in the evolution and diversification of the nat gene family in primates by applying paml codon-based models to the  <dig> coding sequences of the primate data set  . despite the increased power afforded by the larger number of sequences included in the analysis , we did not find any evidence of adaptive selection during primate evolution at any nat coding site. models m1a and m2a showed no difference , and model m <dig> was not significantly more likely than model m <dig> . detailed analysis of the tree using the free-ratio model of codeml did, however, identify a number of branches with ω values higher than  <dig> , the strongest evidence being found in the lineage leading to strepsirrhini , consistent with the full vertebrate dataset analysis results. the branch-site tests, performed at both the branch and clade levels , identified one branch evolving at an elevated rate compared to other branches of the phylogeny  as well as three clades within the set of orthologous nat <dig> sequences with evidence of positive selection . these results were, however, no longer significant after applying the bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. no positively selected sites were identified with significance  with these branch-site tests.

a possible limitation of our analysis is that it relies on the assumption that the different orthologous and paralogous sequences compared have equivalent functions. the inclusion in the alignment of homologous proteins with different biological functions which may have experienced different selective regimes can indeed give rise to incorrect estimations of ω. this could be the case if, as observed for the human nat <dig> and nat <dig> paralogs, the two ancestral nat <dig> and nat <dig> paralogs diverged in function soon after the duplication event, before the first speciation leading to catarrhini and platyrrhini. thus, in order to maintain a correct comparative framework and to avoid the inclusion of paralogous sequences where changes in protein function occurred, we conducted separate analyses of the sets of orthologous nat <dig> sequences and orthologous nat <dig> sequences found in simiiformes.

for the data set including the  <dig> sequences orthologous to human nat <dig>  models incorporating positive selection  provided no better fit to the data than models including only purifying selection and neutrally evolving sites  . the null model m <dig>  which assumes only one ω for all amino acid sites, could not be rejected . under this model, the estimate of ω was  <dig> , indicating that nat <dig> sequences have been subject to strong purifying selection to maintain protein function over time. the selective regime has been variable among species since different ω values along different branches were significantly different from each other . interestingly, despite the dominant role of purifying selection in nat <dig> protein evolution, a recent episode of positive selection was detected specifically and exclusively in the human lineage . five codon sites were found to show nonsynonymous substitutions along this branch , whereas no synonymous codon changes occurred.

by contrast, site-specific codeml analysis performed on the set of sequences orthologous to human nat <dig> yielded very different results with a rather strong evidence of positive selection , indicating that nat <dig> has been subject to diversifying selection to change its amino acid sequence over time . parameter estimates under model m <dig>  which provided the best fit to the data, suggested  <dig> % of sites to be under positive selection with ω =  <dig> . estimates from posterior probability provided significant support of positive selection for codons  <dig> and  <dig>  under m <dig>  it is noteworthy that these two codons were also identified as positively selected with pp ranging from 77% to 87% in the three nat <dig> clades pointed out by multiple branch-site analysis . codon site  <dig>  which plays a key role in determining nat <dig> substrate selectivity, was identified with lower confidence . although the free-ratio model was not a better fit to the data than a single ω ratio for the entire nat <dig> phylogeny , some branches did exhibit ω >  <dig> .

variation of selective pressures along the nat protein sequence
the three-dimensional crystal structure of nat isoenzymes has been resolved for several organisms, enabling a thorough evaluation of structure-function relationships without the limitations inherent to molecular homology modeling  <cit> . the fold of human nat <dig> and nat <dig> proteins largely resembles the overall structure of their prokaryotic orthologs, traditionally described as composed of three domains, each of which being approximately equal in length  <cit>  . the first domain is predominantly α-helical, the second domain mainly consists of β-strands and the third domain is a α/β lid. the first two domains, which have been implicated in active-site pocket formation and acetyl-coa binding, are connected to the third domain through the α-helical interdomain. the third domain has been associated with acetyl-acceptor specificity  <cit> . in human nats, residues  <dig> and  <dig> bracket a 17-residue insertion, which is absent in the structures of prokaryotic nats. this loop located in domain ii is associated with the domain iii β-sheet, apparently providing structural stability and limiting active site access  <cit> . also, the c-terminal tail is not α-helical, as is the case for the bacterial nats, but is instead a coil that reaches around and associates with the active site cleft, thereby playing a key role in defining the size and shape of the active site pocket.

the well-known relationship between the primary sequence of eukaryotic nats and the structural and functional features of these enzymes prompted us to examine the variation of ω along the nat protein sequence in the different datasets investigated:  the vertebrate dataset, including the full set of  <dig> vertebrate sequences as well as a subset of  <dig> mammalian sequences, and  the primate dataset, including the full set of  <dig> primate sequences as well as the subset of  <dig> simian nat <dig> orthologous sequences. we looked at the variation of the posterior mean of ω as estimated by the codeml program under the site-specific model that best fitted the data . moreover, we tested for significant differences in the mean ω value between different parts of the protein  and different sets of sites . our results revealed a significant heterogeneity of ω between the four protein domains  in the four datasets analysed . more specifically, the first domain was found to evolve under more selective constraints, with a mean ω value being significantly lower than those observed for domain ii, domain iii or the rest of the sequence . by contrast, domains ii and iii did not show any differences in their mean ω value when compared to the rest of the sequence . these results were consistently observed in the four datasets examined. besides, the interdomain region, 17-residue insert and c-terminal tail were all found to evolve in vertebrates under more relaxed selective constraints than the rest of the sequence, as reflected by significantly higher ω values . a similar finding was observed for the c-terminal tail in the mammalian , primate  and simian nat <dig>  datasets, consistent with the major role of this region in determining arylamine substrate specificity. interestingly, the mean ω value of the set of sites involved in coa binding was strikingly high when compared to the mean ω value at the global protein level in vertebrates , mammals  and primates . conversely, adaptive molecular evolution was evidenced in the simian nat <dig> dataset for those sites involved in substrate binding compared to the full set of sites in the protein .

discussion
the general role of nats in the detoxification and metabolic activation of aromatic amine xenobiotics, ranging from dietary components to common environmental toxins and pharmaceuticals, has been well documented . the possibility that the nat enzymes could be broadening or changing their substrate specificity in accordance to the high diversity of xenobiotics compounds environmentally available suggests that their metabolic function could be under adaptive evolution and makes them a promising subject for evolutionary analyses. numerous studies have indeed identified the signature of different selective pressures in genes involved in the metabolism of exogenous substances  <cit> . however, in contrast to the evolutionary processes affecting the nat <dig> gene in humans, which have been the subject of extensive research, little is known about the role of molecular adaptation in the evolution and diversification of the nat gene family as a whole on a longer evolutionary time scale.

the ongoing sequencing of entire genomes from various organisms is providing unparalleled opportunity to trace the evolutionary history of the nat gene family by enabling the inference of the phylogenetic relationships among nat sequences over a wide range of taxa. several previous surveys of public genomic databases have retrieved nat-like sequences and documented the distribution of nat genes across all major clades of life  <cit> . the last survey by glenn et al.  <cit>  provided an exhaustive annotation of nat-homologous sequences recovered through inspection of  <dig> genomes encompassing all major taxa from bacteria and archaea to protists and fungi, to animals. the same investigators also performed phylogenetic analyses of the retrieved nat-homologous protein sequences, providing a broad perspective of nat evolution. another study, focusing specifically on the phylogeny of nats in fungi, has also been published since then  <cit> . in the present study, we expanded the previous survey by glenn et al.  <cit>  by performing a comprehensive search of nat-like sequences in the genomes of vertebrate species and compiled an up-to-date dataset of  <dig> vertebrate nat sequences from  <dig> distinct species, among which  <dig> were identified for the first time . in contrast to the previous dataset of  <dig> vertebrate sequences in glenn et al.  <cit> , we decided to exclude one lizard and three fish sequences from analysis  because they aligned poorly with other vertebrate nats and introduced too many gaps and alignment ambiguities. the deduced protein sequence of these four genes clustered together in a monophyletic clade with three invertebrate nat protein sequences at the basal position of the vertebrate nat phylogeny reconstructed by glenn et al.  <cit> . the authors suspected the possibility that this clustering might be an artifact stemming from long branch attraction, supporting our decision to exclude these particular sequences from our phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate nat genes. it is also important to note that, because the vertebrate genomes we considered are in various stages of draft sequencing, assembly, and annotation, we cannot exclude that the present survey missed additional extant nat sequences. this warrants some caution in the conclusions that may be drawn from the present phylogenetic analysis. the increased availability of genome sequence data from diversified taxa is likely to continue to improve our understanding of the evolutionary history of the nat gene family in vertebrates.

our phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate nat sequences nevertheless demonstrated that the nat gene family has evolved under a dynamic process called birth-and-death evolution. this process, which operates through three major mechanisms - neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, and pseudogenization, is thought to be an important source of genetic diversity and evolutionary change that affords functional diversification over short timescales  <cit> . our results are in accordance with the previous observations by thomas  <cit>  that genes encoding enzymes that function as xenobiotic detoxifiers are often phylogenetically unstable genes that undergo rapid birth-and-death evolution, possibly in response to changing environmental conditions. it is noteworthy that martins et al.  <cit>  found similar patterns of gain and loss in fungi, arguing for a complex dynamics of these genes in a broader range of organisms.

concerted evolution via interlocus gene conversion is increasingly recognized as a major feature of evolution in small multigene families . by homogeneizing the sequence of paralogous gene copies, the converted paralogs may come to resemble one another more than they do to orthologous sequences in other species. therefore, gene conversion may potentially alter the relationships among paralogs and lead to the conclusion of independent duplications instead of multiple gene conversions in multiple species. the work carried on the cyp1a <dig> subfamily  <cit>  provides a good example of how gene conversion can obfuscate gene orthology relationships and lead to incorrect conclusions when based solely on the results of traditional phylogenetic analyses. however, identification of gene conversion events remains a challenging task as the methods commonly employed for detecting such events can have a high false-negative rate, particularly when gene conversion is frequent and covers a large portion of the duplicates  <cit> . it is thus advocated to consider the occurrence of gene conversion using various recombination detection algorithms and to combine information coming from both phylogenetic analysis and fine-scale synteny maps. we have used six different methods to evidence possible recombination events between paralogous pairs. only four events, each involving a nat1-nat <dig> pair, were detected by at least two methods , thus suggesting that concerted evolution has played only a minor role in the diversification of the vertebrate nat gene family. this conclusion is further supported by:  the identical phylogenetic relationships inferred from nat sequences of which the regions putatively involved in gene conversion events were truncated , and  the fine-scale synteny comparisons between the three avian species analyzed , as well as between human and mouse , which evidenced multiple gene duplications events occurring independently in specific lineages. thus, our analysis of vertebrate nat sequence data suggests that gene conversion is unlikely to have played a major role in the patterns of divergence of nat sequences and rather supports a scenario of multiple independent gene duplications.

in humans, there are two nat isoenzymes encoded at two polymorphic loci. nat <dig> polymorphisms modify individual cancer risk and drug response, or susceptibility to adverse drug reactions  <cit> . although less well-established, human nat <dig> also exhibits genetic polymorphism and several-albeit as yet inconclusive-studies have suggested that variant nat <dig> genotypes are associated with susceptibility to a number of diseases including various cancers  <cit>  and birth defects  <cit> . given their high level of polymorphism and their association with variable responses to environmental toxins and drugs, these genes are good candidates to test for positive selection and several studies have investigated the possible role of natural selection in shaping genetic variation at these loci . besides their role in phase ii metabolism of xenobiotics, several studies have explored the possible endogenous roles of these enzymes. while no endogenous substrate has been identified to date for nat <dig>  several lines of evidence support the role of human nat <dig> in folate catabolism, thereby providing an explanation for its postulated association with congenital defects linked to a disruption in folate metabolism  <cit> . the widespread tissue distribution of nat <dig> and its early expression in development further support a physiological role of this enzyme which might be essential to normal embryonic development . therefore, since nat <dig> and nat <dig> appear to have distinct functional roles in humans, it is worthwhile to investigate whether these genes have experienced different selective regimes throughout evolution. the identification of the true orthologous sequences to human nat <dig> and human nat <dig> in simiiformes and their determination in  <dig> additional simian species  provided us the necessary power to enable a separate analysis of the two sets of sequences and evaluate the changes in selective pressures experienced by the two gene copies after their functional divergence. interestingly, two distinct evolutionary patterns emerged for the two paralogs . our analysis suggested a dominant role of purifying selection in nat <dig> protein evolution, acting for a conservation of biochemical functions which is in agreement with the role of nat <dig> in endogenous metabolism and homeostasis. note, however, that a signal of positive selection was detected in the human lineage for this gene and that the pattern of evolution of nat <dig> is likely to be mosaic with some evidence of positive selection in certain lineages . by contrast, in most of the species investigated, nat <dig> was predicted to evolve under diversifying selection to change its amino acid sequence over time, probably in response to changes in xenobiotic exposure. this finding is consistent with the observations made at a population level within the human species by previously published studies which supported an adaptive evolution of the nat <dig> gene through either balancing or directional selection  <cit> . similarly, the low level of polymorphism reported at nat <dig> within the human species  <cit>  is consistent with the action of purifying selection evidenced at the interspecies level in the present study. evolutionary analyses thus strongly support a differential role of the two isoenzymes and the involvement of nat <dig> in endogenous metabolic pathways. although the folate catabolite pabg is the only endogenous substrate identified to date, one cannot dismiss the possibility that other as yet unknown endogenous substrates and physiological roles may exist for nat <dig> 

besides an evaluation of the selective forces acting on members of the nat gene family, our ml-based phylogenetic analysis allowed us to estimate the strength of natural selection acting at a codon level and to shed light on episodes of adaptive evolution at specific sites and domains of the protein. several amino acid sites were predicted to be under positive selection with high pp  throughout vertebrate evolution: codons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  interestingly, four of these codon positions were shown to be involved in coa binding according to the recent structural studies performed on human nat <dig> and nat <dig> isoenzymes  <cit> . the residues 97p and 98 v are involved in hydrophobic interactions with the adenine ring of coa, whereas the amide nitrogen of residue 104 g and the hydroxyl group of 214 t form hydrogen bonds with the pyrophosphate group of coa. it is noteworthy that the fifth codon position predicted to be under adaptive evolution is the site of a well-known polymorphism in the human nat <dig> protein: g286e , which defines the nat2* <dig> slow haplotype series, is one of the four major nonsynonymous substitutions encountered in human populations and is particularly common in asia  <cit> . functional studies of the g286e variant in mammalian cells demonstrated reduced affinity to both substrate and cofactor acetyl-coa, resulting in reduced catalytic activity towards some substrates  but not others   <cit> . codon  <dig> is located on the c-terminal tail in the third domain directly adjacent to the active site. because the c-terminal tail has an important role in defining the size and shape of the active site cavity, a significant amino acid change at this position is likely to alter active site access and substrate selectivity, which is consistent with the substrate-dependent activity changes observed experimentally for the g <dig> variant. such a significant change to a c-terminal residue adjacent to the active site is also likely to affect acetyl-coa binding and 68c acetylation  <cit> . note that the branch-site tests identified four additional sites  as having evolved under positive selection along particular lineages of the vertebrate phylogeny or in a specific clade . interestingly, codon  <dig> is also known to be involved in coa binding and codon  <dig> is located in the c-terminus region of the protein. moreover, two codon sites  were pinpointed to be under diversifying selection throughout simian nat <dig> evolution. while the functional and/or structural significance of these two codons have not yet been explored, they are likely to be important in the function of the nat <dig> protein and further investigations are warranted to define their potential relevance. in contrast to these positively selected codons, very low values of ω, suggesting rather strong functional constraints, were observed for the three sites of the catalytic triad:  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for cys <dig>  his <dig>  asp <dig>  respectively, in the vertebrate dataset. these three sites were all conserved in the entire set of nat coding sequences considered, thereby confirming the importance of these three residues in the activation of the active site cysteine residue. interestingly, domain i was found to be more constrained than the other domains of the protein, consistent with the lower variability displayed by this region  =  <dig> ) as compared to domain ii  and domain iii . conversely, higher ω values were observed for the interdomain, 17-residue insert and c-terminus regions of the protein. in particular, the c-terminal tail was shown to evolve under more relaxed selective constraints in the four datasets examined and many sites pinpointed to be under adaptive evolution were located in this region. this is consistent with the association of this region with different acetyl-coa binding properties and substrate specificities.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we provided unequivocal evidence that the nat gene family has undergone a complex history of duplications and possibly gene losses, as observed for many multigene families encoding xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes . we also found evidence of positive selection for amino acid change in the nat protein sequence in many lineages throughout vertebrate evolution, suggesting that diversification of the nat gene family is achieved by a combination of gene duplication and selection-driven divergence in sequence. by then focusing on the evolution of this family in primates, we revealed different selective regimes for the two primate paralogs nat <dig> and nat <dig>  consistent with a differential role of the two isoenzymes. our evolutionary analyses strongly support the key role of the c-terminal region which should be a primary focus of future functional studies.
