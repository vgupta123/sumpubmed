BACKGROUND
the coal oil point seep area , located in the santa barbara channel, california, is one of the most active seep areas in the world  <cit> . seepage of the greenhouse gas methane and other hydrocarbons has occurred in this area for over  <dig>  <dig> years  <cit> . the methane emitted from the cop is mainly of thermogenic origin and the daily emission has been estimated to be at least  <dig> metric tons  <cit> .

at a global scale, the oceans only make up about 2% of the global methane emission budget  <cit> . this low level is explained by prokaryotic oxidation of methane in marine sediments and bedrocks before it reaches the water column  <cit> .

the oxygen penetration level in marine sediments is shallow, so most of the methane oxidation takes place at anaerobic conditions. anaerobic oxidation of methane  is assumed to be a coupling of reversed methanogenesis and sulphate reduction. this process is likely performed by the yet uncultured anaerobic methanotrophic archaea  in syntrophy with sulphate reducing bacteria . based on phylogeny, anme can be divided into three clades: anme- <dig>  anme- <dig> and anme- <dig>  <cit> . anme- <dig> and anme- <dig> are affiliated to the methanosarcinales, while anme- <dig> is only distantly related to the methanosarcinales and methanomicrobiales  <cit> . both anme- <dig> and anme- <dig> are associated with sulphur reducing deltaproteobacteria of the desulfosarcina/desulfococcus-branch  <cit> . anme- <dig> is mainly associated with srb strains closely related to desulfobulbus  <cit> .

the reversed methanogenesis model for aom has gained support by a metagenomic study on anme at eel river  <cit>  and sequencing of an anme- <dig> draft genome  <cit> . in these studies sequence homologues of all enzymes needed for co2-based methanogenesis with exception of n <dig>  n10-methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin reductase  were identified. methyl-coenzyme m reductase  is assumed to catalyze the first step of aom and the last step of methanogenesis, and is therefore a marker gene for both processes. similarly, dissimilatory sulphite reductase  is often used as a marker gene for srb  <cit> .

when oxygen is present, aerobic methanotrophs are active in methane oxidation. known aerobic methanotrophs include representatives of gammaproteobacteria, alphaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobia  <cit> . these organisms convert methane to methanol using the enzyme methane monooxygenase  <cit> . the particulate, membrane bound version of methane monooxygenase , found in all aerobic methanotrophs , is used as a marker gene for aerobic oxidation of methane  <cit> . the methanol formed is converted to formaldehyde, which is assimilated by one of two known pathways. type i and type ii methanotrophs utilize the ribulose monophosphate pathway and the serine pathway respectively. type × methanotrophs use primarily the ribulose monophosphate pathway, but possess the enzymes needed for the serine pathway as well  <cit> .

stable isotope probing and sequencing of 16s rdna and pmoa, as well as lipid biomarker analysis, have detected type-i aerobic methanotrophs in sediments and biofilms at the cop shane and brian seeps  <cit> . recently, measurements of average δ13c of carbonates and lipid biomarkers associated with anme and srb also indicated occurrence of aom at the brian seep  <cit> . another survey at the brian seep detected anme- <dig> at 6- <dig> cm bsf  by fish   <cit> .

in the present study, we have used metagenomics to characterize the taxonomic and metabolic potential for both aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation in two sediment samples from different depths at the tonya seep . by avoiding pcr amplification and primer target specificity, the metagenomics approach offered further insight into the taxonomy and metabolic potential of the prokaryotic communities of the methane seep sediments.

RESULTS
gas measurements and methane oxidation rate
the average methane oxidation rate based on  <dig> measurements in the top  <dig> cm of the seep sediments was  <dig> ±  <dig> nmol cm- <dig> day- <dig>  still, the gas emitted from the tonya seep sediments into the water phase contained a large fraction of methane. even after travelling  <dig> m through the water column, where dissolved o <dig> and n <dig> entered the bubbles, the two gas samples contained  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  methane. when o <dig> and n <dig> were excluded, and the hydrocarbon and co <dig> content were normalized, methane accounted for  <dig> % in both gas samples. the remainder consisted of co <dig> and short chain hydrocarbons .

metagenome creation through filtering of reads
 <dig> sequencing resulted in  <dig> reads for the 0- <dig> cm sample and  <dig> reads for the 10- <dig> cm sample. replicate filtering of the metagenomes removed  <dig> % of the reads from the 0- <dig> cm sample and  <dig> % of the reads in the 10- <dig> cm sample. the resulting metagenomes consisted of  <dig> reads  for the 0- <dig> cm sample and  <dig> reads  for the 10- <dig> cm sample. all further analyses were performed on these metagenomes . unless other ways specified, all percentages throughout the text are given as percent of total reads for each filtered metagenome.

estimated effective genome sizes  were  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  mbp for the 0- <dig> cm and 10- <dig> cm sample respectively .

rarefaction analysis
rarefaction analysis at the most resolved level of the ncbi taxonomy in megan showed the taxonomic richness detected in the sediment samples . including all assigned taxa,  <dig> and  <dig> leaves were detected in the 0- <dig> cm and 10- <dig> cm metagenome respectively. of these,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were bacterial and  <dig>  and  <dig>  archaeal. the rarefaction curves for bacterial and total taxa indicated that not all the taxonomic richness in the sediment was accounted for in our metagenomes. still, the curves were levelling off from a straight line already at 10% of the metagenome size indicating repeated sampling of the same taxon. it is therefore likely that abundant taxa in the sediments were accounted for in the two metagenomes.

while most of the archaeal taxa in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome were accounted for, the number of taxa in the 0- <dig> cm was still increasing at 100% sampling. this difference is likely due to the low abundance of archaea in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome  compared to the 10- <dig> cm metagenome  as shown in figure  <dig> 

taxonomic binning
there was a significant difference in the proportion of reads assigned to bacteria and archaea for the two metagenomes . in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome  <dig> % of the reads were assigned to bacteria and  <dig> % to archaea, while in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome  <dig> % of the reads were assigned to bacteria and as much as  <dig> % to archaea. this shift in the prokaryotic community structure suggests that archaea thrive better and thereby also are likely to contribute more to the metabolism in the 10- <dig> cm sediment horizon.

xipe analyses of the binned reads  at the phylum level  and at the genus level  showed a significant difference between the two metagenomes as to the most abundant taxa  <cit> . the high abundance of archaea in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome compared to the 0- <dig> cm metagenome was striking at the phylum level as well . in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome, reads assigned to proteobacteria and to "archaeal environmental samples" were almost equally abundant, representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads respectively. in contrast, "archaeal environmental samples" represented only  <dig> % of the 0- <dig> cm metagenome, where reads assigned to proteobacteria representing  <dig> % were clearly most abundant . euryarchaeota was also significantly better represented in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome.

the table presents number of reads assigned at the phylum level in megan. for the phylum proteobacteria, subsets of reads assigned proteobacterial classes are shown. all percentages are given as the percentage of total reads for each filtered metagenome.

among the proteobacteria, sulfurovum was the most abundant genus in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome . this sulphur oxidizing genus, with its versatile energy metabolism, is known to thrive in sediments related to hydrothermal seepage where reductive and oxidative states in the mixing zone often fluctuate  <cit> . sulfurovum was almost four times more abundant in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome compared to the 10- <dig> cm metagenome. this is consistent with oxidative zones being its preferred habitat  <cit> .

taxa potentially involved in methane oxidation
the methane oxidation measurements in the sediment cores indicated methanotrophic activity at both sediment depths. the metagenomes were searched for reads assigned to known methanotrophic genera that might be involved in methane oxidation. methylococcus was the predominant aerobic methanotrophic genus in both metagenomes, but was significantly more abundant in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome where it accounted for  <dig> % of the reads compared to the 10- <dig> cm metagenome where it accounted for  <dig> % of the reads . although reads assigned to the aerobe methanotrophs methylomonas, methylocella and methylacidiphilum were also detected, methylococcus was approximately  <dig> and  <dig>  times more abundant than these genera combined in the 0- <dig> cm and 10- <dig> cm metagenome respectively.

anme groups were the predominant anaerobic methanotrophs in the sediments. since taxonomic classification of reads in megan was based on the ncbi taxonomy, the anme clades were not recognized as independent taxa. the artificial taxon "archaeal environmental samples" was however represented . inspection of the reads assigned to this taxon revealed their assignment to anme- <dig> and anme- <dig> fosmids isolated from eel river  <cit>  or to "uncultured archaeon". further inspection of the best hits for the reads assigned to "uncultured archaeon"  showed that most of these reads were associated to anme as well, while a few reads were assigned to fosmids isolated from methane seeps offshore japan  <cit>  .

the table presents reads assigned to archaeal environmental samples" further classified as anme. all percentages are given as the percentage of total reads for each filtered metagenome.

the anme- <dig> clade was by far the anaerobic methanotroph with most assigned reads, although anme- <dig> and anme- <dig> also were present in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome . anme- <dig> and anme- <dig> were detected with low abundance in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome. the high abundance of anme in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome indicates that aom caused the high methane oxidation rates measured at this depth.

anme are assumed to live in syntrophy with srb. the most abundant genera of srb in the metagenomes from the tonya seep were desulfococcus, desulfobacterium and desulfatibacillum . these genera were abundant in both metagenomes, and desulfococcus, a common partner of anme  <cit> , especially so in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome .

reads assigned to the bacterial nc <dig> group were present in both metagenomes . it has been proposed that candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera of the nc <dig> group can oxidize methane anaerobically without an archaeal partner  <cit> . a pathway of "intra-aerobic" methane oxidation where an intracellular supply of oxygen is produced by metabolism of nitrite to oxygen and dinitrogen has been suggested. this intracellularly produced oxygen is then used for the oxidation of methane via pmoa  <cit> . reads assigned to nc <dig> were significantly overrepresented  in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome compared to the 0- <dig> cm metagenome. still, there was far less reads  assigned to nc <dig> than to anme- <dig> in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome.

methane oxidation pathways
to gain insight into the metabolic pathways for methane oxidation at the tonya seep, we annotated the reads from each metagenome to ko and ec numbers and plotted them onto kegg pathway maps. in this way, the methane monooxygenase gene  was identified in the 0- <dig> cm sample, supporting the idea of aerobic methane oxidation in this sediment horizon. this gene was not detected in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome.

all the genes needed for aom/methanogenesis, including mcra , were detected in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome . in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome, the genes for methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase  and methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase  were not detected. this is likely due to the low abundance of reads assigned to euryarchaeota and "archaeal environmental samples", and thereby low coverage of genes encoded by these taxa, in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome. in total,  <dig> reads were assigned to these taxa in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome. with an average sequence length of  <dig> bases this gives a total of  <dig>  m bases, while the average anme- <dig> genome size is estimated to be  <dig> - <dig>  mbp   <cit> .

anaerobic oxidation of methane is usually associated with dissimilatory sulphate reduction, where adenylyl-sulphate reductase  first reduces sulphate to sulphite before dissimilatory sulphite reductase  reduces sulphite to sulphide  <cit> . these genes were detected in both metagenomes.

marker genes
to obtain a more precise picture of taxa actually capable of methane oxidation in our sediment, the metagenomes were compared with libraries of marker genes for methane oxidation. estimated probabilities for identifying the specific marker genes were used to calculate expected hits to marker genes in a scenario where all organisms in the communities contained the gene in question . based on these expected numbers, and the number of marker genes actually detected, we estimated the fraction of the community containing the gene. eight reads in total matched pmoa, the marker gene for aerobic methane oxidation . in megan, one of these was assigned to the genus methylococcus of the family methylococcaceae while six reads were assigned to unclassified methylococcaceae. this point towards methylococcaceae as the most important family of aerobic methane oxidizers at the tonya seep sediments, as was also indicated by taxonomic abundance. seven out of eight reads assigned to pmoa were from the 0- <dig> cm sample, supporting that aerobic methane oxidation is conducted in the shallower layer of the sediment. the estimated fraction of the community coding for pmoa, based on marker gene detection, was calculated to  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the 0- <dig> cm and 10- <dig> cm respectively .

the marker gene for aom, mcra, is also a key gene in methanogenesis, where it catalyzes the last step. the 0- <dig> cm sample contained only one mcra read, assigned to the methanogenic genus methanosarcina . in the 10- <dig> cm sample  <dig> reads matching mcra were found, all assigned to anme- <dig>  based on egs and expected number of reads matching mcra, the estimated fraction of the community in the 10- <dig> cm sample made up of anme- <dig> was  <dig> % .

in order to detect possible srb partners of anme, we compared the two metagenomes to a dsrab library. of  <dig> hits,  <dig> were assigned to the reversed form of dsrab found in sulphur compound-oxidizing bacteria. sixteen and eleven dsrab reads from the possible srb partners of anme were detected in the 0- <dig> cm and 10- <dig> cm metagenomes respectively, estimations based on the probability of detecting this gene thereby indicate that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the 0- <dig> cm and 10- <dig> cm community were made up by srb respectively .

most srb dsrab reads were assigned to "bacterial environmental samples" and the deltaproteobacterial genera desulfotaela, desulfobacula, desulfobacterium, desulfobacter, desulfatibacillum and bilophila . the reads assigned to "bacterial environmental samples" matched clones from a diverse range of sediments  <cit>  and one clone from an acidic fan soil sample  <cit> . eight of the reads assigned to "bacterial environmental samples"  were most similar to dsrab sequences from deltaproteobacteria  <cit>  . none of the dsrab reads were assigned to desulfosarcina or desulfococcus, the previously described syntrophic partners of anme- <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
methane oxidation rate
methane oxidation rates in our sediment cores were  <dig> ±  <dig> nmol cm- <dig> day- <dig>  this is much higher than the methane oxidation rates at the nearby brian seep   <cit>  and within the range of aom at seeps with surface hydrates, mud volcanoes and gas chimneys . it has been suggested that the relatively low methane oxidation rate at the brian seep could be caused by the permeable, sandy sediments leading to low amounts of dissolved methane in the pore water  <cit> . conversely, the higher methane oxidation rate at the tonya seep could be due to the less permeable, relatively oily tar containing sediments at this seep.

taxonomic richness and coverage
taxonomic classification was based on a blastx query against the ncbi non-redundant protein database . it has previously been shown that the prokaryotic representation in public sequence databases, such as the ncbip-nr, is heavily biased towards taxa that are easily cultivable or of anthropogenic interest  <cit> . many of the taxa represented are further only partially sequenced  <cit> . these issues may lead to false assignment of reads, especially if only the top hit is considered. by employing the lca algorithm of megan, most of these wrong assignments are avoided at the cost of more reads being assigned to taxa of low specificity or not being assigned at all  <cit> . short reads may also be a source of ambiguous taxonomic classification, especially if they are from a highly conserved region of the genome or from a region susceptible to horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . we therefore calculated the average read length for reads assigned to different taxonomic levels in megan to see if it decreased with decreasing taxonomic specificity . this was not the case as average lengths of reads assigned to all taxonomic levels in megan  were in the same range . read with no hits against the ncbip-nr were however considerably shorter .

rarefaction analyses indicated that the most abundant taxa of the tonya seep sediments were accounted for in our metagenomes. the taxonomic richness of prokaryotes, in combination with high egs, does however lead to low coverage of most genomes represented in the metagenomes. absence of a single marker gene assigned to a specific taxon might therefore be due to chance. still, we detected more marker genes than expected based on the taxonomic binning of reads. this could be due to an overestimation of the egs. it has previously been discussed that a bit score threshold of  <dig>  might discriminate against short reads, and that lowering of the threshold would result in decreased egs  <cit> . a decreased egs would in turn result in a reduction of the estimated fraction of the community carrying the marker genes mcra, pmoa and dsrab. differences in copy number for organisms carrying the gene might also affect the expected number of hits.

aerobic methane oxidation
due to limited oxygen penetration, active aerobic methane oxidation is probably limited to a thin surface layer. the maximum oxygen penetration at the nearby brian seep sediments was measured to a depth of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . due to high tar content, oxygen penetration in the sediments of the tonya seep is expected to be more restricted than at the brian seep.

methane monooxygenase  was only detected in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome after plotting of ko and ec numbers onto kegg pathway maps. overrepresentation of aerobic methanotrophic genera and pmoa  in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome compared to the 10- <dig> cm metagenome further support aerobic oxidation of methane in the 0- <dig> cm sediment sample .

both taxonomic binning of reads and marker gene classification point to type i methanotrophs of methylococcaceae as the most important aerobic methane oxidizers in our samples. while methylococcus was the aerobic methanotrophic genus with most reads assigned , most of the detected pmoa reads were assigned to unclassified methylococcaceae . this indicates that uncultured type i methanotrophs might play an important role in aerobic methane oxidation at the tonya seep. also in microbial mats and sediments of the nearby shane and brian seeps aerobic type i methanotrophs have been identified, while no type ii methanotrophs were detected at either of these sites  <cit> . this is consistent with type i methanotrophs dominating over type ii methanotrophs in most marine settings .

anaerobic methane oxidation
genes for aom were detected in both metagenomes . the taxonomic binning of reads points to amne- <dig> as the predominant anaerobic oxidizer of methane in the tonya seep sediment, especially in the 10- <dig> cm sediment sample. it is however, important to notice that anme- <dig>  due to the genome sequencing efforts  <cit> , is the most sequenced anme-clade, and therefore overrepresented in the database. this could skew our relative abundance results. however, the presence and dominance of anme- <dig> was further supported by the mcra reads in our metagenomes . this gene is identified in all anme-clades, still all reads matching mcra in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome were assigned to anme- <dig>  taken together, these results provide strong evidence of anme- <dig> being the most important clade for anaerobic methane oxidation in the tonya seep sediments. in contrast, only anme- <dig> was detected at the nearby brian seep  <cit> . anme- <dig> and anme- <dig> are known to co-occur in sediments, usually with one type more abundant than the other  <cit> . the environmental conditions that might regulate the relative abundance of the different anme clades in marine sediments are still not known  <cit> . differences in permeability of the sediments at the tonya and brian seeps could be one factor selecting for different anme clades at the two sites.

sulphate reducing bacteria
anaerobic oxidation of methane is assumed to be coupled to dissimilatory reduction of sulphate. both metagenomes had reads assigned to srb genera, predominantly desulfococcus, desulfobacterium and desulfatibacillum . the ratio of total reads assigned to anme related to reads assigned to each of these srb genera in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome were anme: desulfobacterium; 16:  <dig>  anme desulfatibacillum; 20: <dig> and anme: desulfococcus; 24:  <dig>  the total ratio anme: srb  was 4:  <dig> 

reads assigned to dsrab were detected in both metagenomes and classified to a diverse set of taxa . although the fraction of the community containing mcra and dsrab, calculated based on sampling probability of the specific marker genes, is likely to be overestimated it gives a similar ratio of 3:  <dig> of mcra-containing organisms: dsrab containing organisms as the taxonomic binning of reads. none of our dsrab reads were assigned to the known anme partner desulfococcus, although this genus was one of the most abundant srb genera in our metagenomes . this does not imply absence of dsrab among desulfococcus in our samples; the gene was more likely missed by chance due to low coverage .

anme might also form syntrophic relationships to other bacteria than those most commonly recognized. anme- <dig> has previously been detected to form physical associations to both desulfobulbus and a member of the betaproteobacteria, as well as their regular partners from the desulfococcus/desulfosarcina branch  <cit> . the main bulk of dsrab-reads in the 10- <dig> cm metagenome were assigned to "bacterial environmental samples" and the anme partners might be found among these organisms. the "bacterial environmental samples" is however a diverse group and was also abundant in the 0- <dig> cm metagenome, where anme were less abundant.

our results do not indicate only one predominant anme partner, but rather that several syntrophic partners may be involved. diverse dsrab signatures with only weak coupling to aom have previously been detected in anme- <dig> dominated sediments in the gulf of mexico  <cit> . this suggests that these seep environments have a high diversity of taxa involved in sulphate reduction.

CONCLUSIONS
by using  <dig> sequenced metagenomes we achieved an insight into the taxonomic richness of the seep sediments. most of the taxa were present in both metagenomes and differences in community structure and corresponding metabolic potential between the two samples were due to abundance, indicating sliding boundaries between the different communities. our approach provided strong evidence for the taxa responsible for methane oxidation. the tonya seep harboured several taxa potentially capable of methane oxidation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. this suggests that the sediment is a robust methane filter, where taxa presently dominating this important process could be replaced by less abundant taxa should the environmental conditions change.
