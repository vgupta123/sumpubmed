BACKGROUND
in animals, glucose is stored as glycogen, whereas plants store glucose as starch. starch is a mixture of α-amylose, a linear polysaccharide made of α linked glucose molecules and amylopectin, a branched polysaccharide that varies from α-amylose by the presence of α linked branches every  <dig> to  <dig> residues. glycogen differs from amylopectin in that its α branches occur more frequently, typically every  <dig> to  <dig> residues  <cit> . in animals, glycogen forms  <dig> to 400 Å diameter cytoplasmic granules, which in mammals are especially noticeable in cells that have the greatest need of glycogen—liver and muscle cells, but it is also produced in other types of cells, including neurons where it can have deleterious effects  <cit> . the branching is important for fast response to metabolic needs, because synthesis and degradation of the glycogen polymer can only occur from the non-reducing ends of the α- <dig>  chains; therefore, highly branched glycogen has a higher number of “ends” per volume. additionally, branching increases the water solubility of glycogen  <cit> – <cit> . while the glycogen role in mammals is best known, it has also been shown to be used as a metabolic reserve in yeast and various bacteria  <cit> .

glycogen synthesis and breakdown involves a number of enzymes, such as glycogen synthase , which adds glucose to the growing glycogen chain, and glycogen phosphorylase , which cleaves linear α linked glycogen chains to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate. the activity of glycogen phosphorylase, however, comes to a halt when it approaches an α linked branch point four units away. in this situation, the action of a debranching enzyme, which removes α linkages, becomes necessary for continued glycogen breakdown  <cit> , <cit> . such debranching enzymes—together with their enzymatic opposites, branching enzymes that introduce α linkages—are the focus of this work. humans, and other mammals, possess one branching enzyme and one debranching enzyme, occurring in various isoforms  <cit>  .

the human glycogen branching enzyme , also referred to as amylo--transglycosylase, is encoded by the gene gbe <dig>  this enzyme is involved in glycogen synthesis by transferring α linked glucosyl blocks from the outer end of a growing glycogen chain to an α position on the same or on an adjacent chain  <cit> . also, this enzyme  has been characterized in the cazy database  <cit>  as a member of the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  <cit> , <cit> . the human glycogen branching enzyme is a large, multidomain enzyme composed of three domains. the n-terminal domain of this enzyme is classified in pfam  <cit>  and cazy as carbohydrate-binding module  <dig>   <cit> . the central domain is a tim barrel glycosyl hydrolase superfamily member   <cit> ; and localized at the c-terminus is an all-beta domain . the n- and c-terminal domains, cbm_ <dig> and alpha-amylase_c, respectively, are distantly homologous and structurally similar. both are classified as members of the glycosyl hydrolase domain  superfamily , which contains substrate binding domains of many carbohydrate hydrolases. branching enzymes with this domain architecture are well conserved throughout all kingdoms of life, with homologs possessing all three domains having been found in plants   <cit> , yeast  <cit> , and various bacteria, including e. coli   <cit> . the three dimensional structures of human  as well as a variety of bacterial  and archaeal  glycogen branching enzymes, together with plant starch branching enzymes , were determined experimentally, allowing for precise domain boundary definitions and detailed comparisons. for the human glycogen branching enzyme, these data are shown in figure  <dig> which depicts the three-dimensional structure of the gbe <dig> gene product, in concert with domain boundaries as defined by pfam hmms and by the three-dimensional structure itself.

the human glycogen debranching enzyme, is encoded by the gene gde . this enzyme, similar to its homologs from some other species , has two biochemical functions—that of amylo-alpha- <dig> -glucosidase  and of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase   <cit> – <cit> . 4-alpha-glucanotransferase transfers a segment of three glucose units from α branched four-unit chains  to an adjacent branch of the glycogen chain. amylo-alpha- <dig> -glucosidase then cleaves the α linkage to release the remaining glucose  <cit> . in other species, such as plants and e. coli , the glucosidase and glucanotransferase activities are carried out by two distinct enzymes , in which case only the glucosidase is referred to as a glycogen debranching enzyme  <cit> – <cit> .

the human glycogen debranching enzyme is almost twice as large as the gbe <dig> enzyme and is composed of at least four domains : hgde_n—hgde_amylase—hgde_central—gde_c. the hgde_amylase domain and the central domain of the branching enzyme, alpha-amylase, are distantly related, as both are members of the tim barrel fold containing the glycosyl hydrolase superfamily   <cit> , <cit> . on the other hand, the n_terminal dge_c domain is predicted to have an alpha/alpha toroidal structure, consisting of several alpha hairpins arranged in a closed circular array, similar to bacterial glucoamylases. as of this writing, there are no experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of human debranching enzymes or any of its close homologs, albeit, as shown in figure  <dig>  reliable predictions can be made for all its domains, except the hgde_central domain.

in contrast to the universally conserved branching enzyme, some bacterial—for instance e. coli   <cit> , and plant debranching enzymes  <cit> —are not homologous to the human debranching enzyme. in fact, they are related to the branching enzymes containing an n-terminal cbm_ <dig> domain followed by alpha-amylase domains. on the other hand, many bacteria and archaea do not have e. coli–type debranching enzymes; instead, they have a homolog of the human debranching enzyme, consisting of the prokaryote-specific c-terminal gde domain preceded by a gde_n domain. no direct experimental evidence for the function of the bacterial proteins with the gde domain currently exists; however, because of their distant homology to eukaryotic debranching enzymes and their genomic distribution, where they are often found in species that lack the e. coli–type of a debranching enzyme, it is often assumed that they indeed function as debranching enzymes. as mentioned above, another difference between human and plant/e. coli debranching enzymes is that human glycogen debranching enzyme possesses a second enzymatic activity, that of a 4-alpha-glucanotransferase  <cit> – <cit> .

 <dig>  glycogen storage diseases
enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism and its regulation are of great medical interest because mutations in these enzymes have been shown to lead to a wide variety of genetic diseases, collectively called glycogen storage diseases . at least ten different types  of gsds have been described, with the phenotypes depending on the enzyme affected and the specific positions of the mutations within a given enzyme. some of the mutations result in the abnormal accumulation of glycogen and/or abnormal glycogen structure . for example, cori’s disease , a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder, is caused by mutations resulting in deficiencies in the glycogen debranching enzyme, preventing depolymerization of glycogen at the α- <dig>  branching points and result in the accumulation, in the liver and muscle, of abnormal glycogen with very short outer chains that cannot be broken down further. the symptoms, such as enlarged liver and hypoglycemia, are similar, but tend to be less severe, than those of type i gsd. interestingly, the liver symptoms usually disappear after puberty  <cit> , <cit> . one of the most severe glycogen storage diseases is anderson’s disease   <cit> – <cit> , a very rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a defective glycogen branching enzyme , leading to the formation and accumulation of abnormal glycogen with long, unbranched chains. gsdiv is also called amylopectinosis, since the glycogen in the affected cells resembles plant amylopectin. the abnormal, elongated glycogen particles lead to cell degeneration and eventually death. the exact mechanism of the cell death in gsdiv is still unknown. the phenotype of this disease is variable, involving the liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and central nervous system, alone or in combinations. the typical gsd type iv disease presents in the first 18 months of life with an enlarged liver and cirrhosis, leading to liver failure and death by 5 years of age  <cit> . another manifestation of the same disease, in the late-onset variant, is as a neurogenerative disease called adult polyglucosan body disease   <cit> . gsdiv is also found in horses and cats  <cit> , <cit> . table  <dig> lists some of the point mutations causing gsdiii, gsdiv and apbd.

human disease  mutations responsible for the glycogen storage diseases gsd <dig>  adult polyglucosan body disease , and gsd <dig>  and their homologous residues in a variety of species are shown. the domains affected by the mutations are indicated in the 5th row . b. theta stands for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. human mutation data were obtained from the uniprotkb and online mendelian inheritance in man databases .

although phylogenetic studies have been performed on subsets of branching and debranching enzymes from a limited range of species , and experimental work  has been done on individual branching and debranching enzymes, especially those from plants, bacteria, and archaea, not much is known about the deep evolutionary histories of these enzyme families. the objective of the analysis presented here is to elucidate the evolution of glycogen and starch branching and debranching enzymes from a wide range of species, covering bacteria, archaea, and all major groups of eukaryotes. in particular, due to their involvement in glycogen storage diseases, we are interested in the evolutionary relationships of the human glycogen branching and debranching enzymes to their well-studied bacterial counterparts glgb and glgx/trex. due to the availability of more than  <dig> completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes, we were able to perform a large scale, protein domain-centric, comparative genomics analysis to assess the linage specific distributions, domain compositions and patterns of sequence conservation of these two important enzymes.

RESULTS
we extracted protein sequences of glycogen branching and debranching enzyme homologs with the characteristic combinations of cbm <dig> and gde_c pfam domains  from  <dig> completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes, covering most major eukaryotic groups, as well as from select archaeal and bacterial genomes . proteins with these domains were then analyzed for their overall domain architectures and for their phylogenetic relationships .

 <dig>  cbm_48—alpha–amylase containing branching and debranching enzymes
phylogenetic analysis of enzymes with a cbm_48—alpha-amylase architecture  shows that these enzymes can be divided into two well separated groups : branching enzymes with a cbm_48—alpha-amylase—alpha-amylase_c architecture and debranching enzymes with mostly a cbm_48—alpha-amylase architecture with either a very divergent form of the alpha-amylase_c domain, or, in some cases, containing additional domains at the n-  and c-termini .

proteins from the first group, with the well-defined cbm_48—alpha-amylase—alpha-amylase_c architecture are present in species from all kingdoms of life and perform branching functions in glycogen and starch biosynthesis pathways . this group includes human gbe <dig>  yeast glc <dig>  dictyostelium glgb, arabidopsis sbes, and e. coli glgb. most organisms have just one representative of this group, with the exception of land plants and green algae  and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria that tend to contain multiple paralogs from this group. for instance, in land plants three sub-groups of starch branching enzymes exist, usually named sbe <dig>  sbe <dig>  and sbe <dig>  however, not all plants possess one member of each subgroup; for example, arabidopsis underwent a recent duplication of sbe <dig>  resulting in sbe2- <dig> and sbe2- <dig>  and also has one sbe <dig> member, but lacks a representative of sbe <dig>  careful phylogenetic analysis shows that this group, due to at least two ancient gene duplications, one of which occurred pre-luca  and one pre-leca , followed by lineage specific gene losses, has to be divided into a minimum of three sub-groups of orthologous proteins . while the existence of a separate, plant-specific subgroup containing sbe <dig> has been reported previously  <cit> , <cit> , our results show that the well-studied e. coli branching enzyme glgb, together with glgb from the cyanobacterium nostoc punctiforme, are clearly not orthologous to human gbe <dig>  yeast glc <dig>  dictyostelium glgb, and plant sbe <dig>  sbe  <dig>  and sbe  <dig>  but instead represent a branch that emerged by an ancient duplication and was lost in most eukaryotes. on the other hand, other bacterial branching enzymes, such as the one of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , are indeed orthologous to human gbe <dig>  we employed the rio approach   <cit> , <cit>  on mrbayes  <cit>  output gene trees to confirm these findings. in short, this approach allows to calculate the probability of orthology relationships by integrating orthology assignments over a distribution of gene trees   <cit> . according to this, the posterior probability of e. coli glgb being orthologous to human gbe <dig> is  <dig> , whereas the posterior probability of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron q8a9p <dig> of being orthologous to human gbe <dig> is  <dig> . these results are further supported by analysis of conserved residues, as described below . finally, it is likely that this group was affected by even more basal gene duplications, but due to relatively poor phylogenetic resolution at the base of this sub-tree, this remains speculative at this moment.

enzymes from the second main group, with cbm_48—alpha-amylase architectures, are only found in land plants and green algae, red algae , and some bacterial and archaeal species. phylogenetic analysis further subdivides this group into two sub-groups of orthologous proteins, correlating with their annotated functions . enzymes in one sub-group perform debranching functions in glycogen and starch catabolic pathways . similar to branching enzymes, these enzymes underwent expansion in land plants. for example, arabidopsis and oryza sativa japonica  contain three paralogs—isoamylase  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the e. coli glycogen debranching enzyme glgx is a member of this group as well. pullanases  form the second sub-group. these enzymes are found in land plants and green algae, red algae, and bacteria  and have additional domains . the significantly different lengths of the alpha_amylase domain of different species depicted in figure  <dig> are likely artifacts of the pfam hmm used to identify them. the three dimensional structure of the human glycogen branching enzyme shows that alpha_amylase occupies most of the space between cbm_ <dig> and alpha_amylase_c . this is likely to be the case in all species.

 <dig>  gde_c domain containing debranching enzymes
phylogenetic analysis of the debranching enzymes paints a very different picture from that of branching enzymes . these proteins are found in animals and fungi and their relatives  and in certain single-celled eukaryotes form the bikonta group , as well as in bacteria and archaea, but are not present in land plants, green algae, and rhodophyta . they exhibit diverse domain architectures, especially between eukaryotes and bacteria/archaea. in eukaryotes, the pfam domain architecture is generally hgde_n—hgde-amylase—hgde_central—gde_c, whereas bacterial and archaeal enzymes are much shorter and have a different domain architecture, with a gde_n domain substituting for the three n-terminal domains of the eukaryotic enzymes, resulting in a gde_n—gde_c arrangement. as mentioned above, no direct experimental evidence for the function of these bacterial and archaeal proteins currently exists, although because of their distant homology to eukaryotic debranching enzymes and their genomic distribution, we speculate that they function as debranching enzymes. furthermore, no three-dimensional structure of any protein from this group of bacterial and archaeal gde_n—gde_c enzymes is available as of this writing, and no reliable predictions can be made about possible relationships between hgde_central and gde_n domains and any other protein domains. a preliminary of analysis of the draft genome of cyanophora paradoxa <cit>  indicates that this representative of the glaucophyta  contains a putative debranching enzyme with a hgde_central—gde_c architecture  and thus is conceivable to have a pattern of branching/debranching enzymes dissimilar to that of other archaeplastida. more genomic data from glaucophyta will be needed to precisely determine where and when during archaeplastida evolution the loss of the hgde-amylase, hgde_central, gde_c, and hgde_n domains occurred.

 <dig>  distribution of branching and debranching enzymes in major groups of eukaryotes
we also investigated the distribution of branching and debranching enzymes over all major groups of eukaryotes with at least one completely sequenced genome . the result is that branching and debranching enzymes can be found in all major groups of eukaryotes. the only possible exception to this is rhizaria , even though with only two completely sequenced genomes in this group, a conclusive answer is impossible at this point. animals , land plants, and green algae have the highest percentage of genomes with both branching and debranching enzymes . for fungi and amoebozoa, these percentages are lower but are still above 60% and 80%, respectively. on the other hand, the majority of the alveolata, stramenopiles, and excavata lack both enzymes but still contain some species with both enzymes . for other groups, due to limited genomes sequenced, a reliable percentage cannot yet be calculated.

 <dig>  human disease mutations in gsd <dig> and gsd <dig> and their counterparts
finally , we investigated the amino-acid conservation in the positions mutated in the human glycogen storage diseases gsd <dig>  gsd <dig>  and apbd in orthologs of the human proteins  from a wide variety of species, as well as in the paralogous glgb enzymes from e. coli and nostoc punctiforme. our results show that all disease mutations occur in highly conserved positions, even when compared to species as distantly related as plants and bacteria, stressing the importance of these positions/residues . on the other hand, in the case of cbm_48—alpha-amylase branching enzymes, this conservation is not maintained in the paralogous enzymes from e. coli and nostoc punctiforme. we have no explanation for unexpectedly low conversion in these positions in the putative enzyme from tetrahymena thermophila, especially since our phylogenetic analysis reveals nothing unusual in its sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
branching enzymes  with a cbm 48—alpha-amylase—alpha-amylase c architecture are present in all the major group of eukaryotes, as well as in archaea and bacteria, and are therefore likely to have been present in the last universal common ancestor . while they are found in the vast majority of all animal and plant genomes  sequenced so far, and are fairly common in fungi, many individual species of single-celled eukaryotes lack identifiable homologs of these enzymes, likely due to gene loss.

for debranching enzymes  with a cbm 48—alpha-amylase architecture, the distribution is very different. on the eukaryotic side, these enzymes are limited to plants and green algae . they are also fairly widespread in bacteria and archaea. in contrast, non-homologous debranching enzymes  containing the gde_c domain can be found in species from all kingdoms of life, except green plants and algae.

comparing these two families allows us to conclude, that in plants, gde_c-containing debranching enzymes have been replaced by cbm48-containing enzymes. in certain bacteria  both types of debranching enzymes exist in parallel.

the only major eukaryotic groups for which we are unable to make reliable conclusions are rhizaria and glaucophyta. rhizaria is the only major group of eukaryotes with at least two fully sequenced genomes for which we were unable to detect any glycogen/starch branching or debranching enzymes . despite their importance in the study of plant evolution , only one draft genome for glaucophyta has been released as of this writing; preventing us from conclusively determining whether the pattern of branching/debranching enzymes in this group of alga is indeed not like that of plants and more like that of the rest of eukaryotes .

as for human glycogen branching enzyme gbe <dig>  the evolutionary history of this protein can be traced back to bacteria, for a putative ortholog of human branching enzyme exists in several bacteria, for instance, in a dominant human gut symbiont—bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. in contrast, our study shows that the well-known e. coli branching enzyme glgb is not an ortholog of its human homolog, but a member of a separate branch that has been lost in many eukaryotes . this obeservation, combined with the low conservation of residues mutated in human diseases in e.coli glgb, has implications against its use as a model for studying human gsd4/apbd. on the other hand, the bacteroides thetaiotaomicron branching enzyme is an attractive target for modeling human glycogen storage diseases in bacteria.

finally, these results show that not only regulatory proteins, such as those involved in apoptosis regulation  <cit> , but also basic metabolic enzymes may have a complex evolutionary history, rich in ancient and recent gene duplications, combined with lineage specific gene losses and dynamic domain architectures, with frequent and surreptitious addition and loss of individual domains. such a history can only be revealed by explicit phylogenetic and comparative domain architecture analysis.
