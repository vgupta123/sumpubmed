BACKGROUND
controlled release of sister chromatid cohesion is essential for balanced segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis. cohesion is brought about by means of the cohesin complex, a ring-shaped structure that is thought to encircle sister chromatids. loading of cohesin takes place during telophase or early in g <dig> and is followed by establishment of cohesion during s phase  <cit>  the cohesin complex is comprised of four subunits that are conserved across species. the kleisin subunit of cohesin sister chromatid cohesion 1/ radiation sensitive  <dig>  in mitosis and the meiotic variant recombination defective  <dig>  is responsible for closing the cohesin ring. cleavage of the kleisin subunit at the metaphase to anaphase transition by the separase protease allows separation of sister chromatids at mitosis . in meiosis, unlike in mitosis, sister centromere cohesion is retained through meiosis i until metaphase of meiosis ii. shugoshin  and protein phosphatase 2a  play an important role in controlling centromere behavior during meiosis . during meiosis i, sgo is responsible for recruitment of protein phosphatase pp2a to centromeres which keeps rec <dig> unphosphorylated and resistant to cleavage by separase. during meiosis ii, rec <dig> is no longer protected and at the metaphase to anaphase transition, cleavage of rec <dig> by separase leads to separation of sister chromatids .

unlike in yeast, during mitosis in higher eukaryotes most of the cohesin located along chromosome arms is released during prophase by a mechanism involving its phosphorylation by polo kinase and additional proteins including wapl helicase . however, centromeric cohesin is protected from release during prophase of mitosis by the action of sgo and pp2a. sgo proteins have also been found to play a role in kinetochore orientation  <cit>  and are essential for viability in mice  <cit> . sgo proteins therefore regulate both kinetochore structure/orientation in addition to their role in protecting centromere cohesion during prophase of mitosis and in meiosis i divisions.

recently the patronus  gene has been shown to be required for maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion during interkinesis of meiosis in arabidopsis thaliana leading to the proposal that sister centromere cohesion is protected at two stages during meiosis: during anaphase i, by the action of sgos and following that during interkinesis by pans <dig>  <cit> . we further investigated the function of pans <dig> and demonstrate here that pans <dig> protein is present maximally in meiosis i and distributed broadly across the nucleus. we determine that, in addition to the major phenotype of pans <dig> comprising loss of sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis ii, pans <dig> mutant meiocytes also show subtle differences in centromere organization in meiosis i. we further find that pans <dig> shows synthetic lethality with osd <dig>  which encodes an inhibitor of the apc/c ubiquitin ligase that has been shown to be required for progression through meiosis and entry into meiosis ii  <cit> . our results indicate that pans <dig> acts through control of the apc/c and that pans <dig> is part of a network that includes apc/c and osd <dig>  that modulates meiotic progression and sister chromatid cohesion, possibly through control of ubiquitination. the timing of expression as well as the meiosis i phenotypes we observe suggest that pans <dig> acts in meiosis i.

RESULTS
centromere phenotypes in meiosis i and loss of centromere cohesion during meiosis ii in pans <dig> mutants
pans <dig> mutants of arabidopsis have been recently reported to cause reduced fertility that arises from a defect in maintenance of centromeric cohesion during interkinesis of male meiosis  <cit> . in pans <dig>  chromosomes have been reported to undergo a normal reductional segregation at meiosis i, however during meiosis ii, chromosomes lose centromeric cohesion prematurely prior to metaphase and as a consequence segregation occurs randomly resulting in the formation of unbalanced meiotic products and reduction in fertility. we confirmed the interkinesis phenotype of pans <dig> comprising loss of centromeric cohesion prematurely in meiosis ii, prior to metaphase leading to unbalanced segregation  and formation of defective microspores : at metaphase i the majority of pans <dig> meiocytes showed  <dig> bivalents as in wild type; in contrast at metaphase ii all  pans <dig> meiocytes showed 6– <dig> chromosomes indicating separation of sister chromatids, whereas for wild type, no meiocytes showed separation of sister chromatids at metaphase ii . hence the major phenotype of pans <dig> is in meiosis ii.fig.  <dig> early loss of centromere cohesion in pans <dig> during meiosis ii. acid spreads of male meiotic chromosomes stained with dapi. a-d wild type, e-i

while the majority of pans <dig> meiocytes showed normal pairing, alignment, and segregation in meiosis i, we also observed a partially penetrant meiosis i phenotype in pans <dig> comprising the presence of two or more univalents at metaphase i . univalents were not observed at metaphase i in the case of wild type. hence the novel meiosis i phenotype of pans <dig> described here is significant . previous studies have described pans <dig> as having a meiotic phenotype confined to interkinesis on the basis of which pans <dig> has been proposed to specifically control centromeric cohesion during interkinesis  <cit> .

loss of centromeric cohesion in pans <dig> during meiosis ii could be due to defects in regulation of cohesion specifically during meiosis ii, or alternatively could also be connected to defects in centromere organization during meiosis i. the small number of meiocytes that we observed exhibiting a phenotype in meiosis i prompted us to further examine centromere organization. to probe centromere structure during meiosis i, we carried out fluorescence in situ hybridization on meiotic chromosome spreads using a pal <dig> centromere repeat probe that hybridizes to pericentromeric repeats  <cit> . centromeres in wild type gave regular and compact signals at metaphase i and showed five bivalents, with two signals per bivalent, each signal representing a pair of sister centromeres. in contrast, differences were observed for pans <dig> wherein about 21 % of the metaphase i stages showed four centromere signals in a bivalent , indicating that sister centromeres were not closely connected. we did not observe splitting of sister centromere signals in midprophase i from zygotene to pachytene in pans <dig> . our interpretation is that although the sister centromeres are still connected at metaphase i, the connection is not as tight as for wild type and separation of the sister centromere signals occurs following attachment of sister centromeres to the meiosis i spindle. the presence of two or more univalent chromosomes was also seen in 5/ <dig> meiocytes showing split centromere signals at metaphase i and the univalent chromosomes showed bipolar attachment to the meiosis i spindle . a mixture of reductional and equational segregation therefore appears to be taking place in these meiocytes. these results indicate that in addition to the major phenotype which reflects a requirement for pans <dig> in retention of centromere cohesion after meiosis i and up to metaphase of meiosis ii  there is a requirement for pans <dig> in centromere cohesion during meiosis i, as reflected in a partially penetrant pans <dig> phenotype with regard to centromere cohesion in meiosis i.fig.  <dig> loss of centromeric cohesion in pans <dig> male meiocytes during meiosis i. fish on male meiotic chromosome spreads using a centromeric repeat probe showing dapi  and probe . left column: merged images of dapi and the probe; middle column: probe alone; right column: dapi. a-c wild type metaphase i. d-i

a genomic fragment comprising the pans <dig> promoter and coding region was fused to a composite green fluorescent protein-beta glucuronidase  reporter to generate a fusion protein and the transgene cassette transformed into plants. analysis of gus reporter gene expression indicated that pans <dig> shows increased expression in growing parts of the plant, being expressed in inflorescence, young buds, and roots . expression declined in older buds and was observed in the basal but not distal portion of young leaves coincident with the pattern of cessation of cell division in leaves which proceeds from tip to base. quantitative analysis of gene expression indicated that pans <dig> is strongly expressed in the inflorescence and at a lower level in leaves and in roots.fig.  <dig> pans <dig> is expressed in actively dividing tissue. p

to obtain more detailed information on subcellular localization of pans <dig> in meiocytes, we generated a flag-tagged pans <dig> line in a pans <dig> mutant background in which the pans <dig> mutant was complemented by the flag-tagged allele. we then examined protein localization in meiosis using an anti-flag antibody. a strong pans1-flag signal was observed up to mid-prophase and declined during late prophase . the pattern of localization extended broadly across the nucleus but appeared to be excluded from the nucleolus. the timing of maximal pans <dig> expression during meiosis therefore appears to precede the onset of the mutant phenotype .fig.  <dig> pans1-flag is localized to the nucleus during prophase i of meiosis. immunostaining of anther squashes of pans1-flag transgenic line, showing chromosomes stained with dapi , flag  and merged images for cyan and green channels .

pans <dig> shows synthetic lethality with osd1
to test whether the sterility caused by pans <dig> is due primarily to defective chromosome segregation during meiosis ii, we crossed pans <dig> with  tardy asynchronous meiosis  <dig>  and osd <dig> mutants in which the majority of meiocytes do not undergo the second meiotic division, leading to the formation of unreduced gametes . in the case of the pans <dig> x tam <dig> crosses we obtained  <dig> double mutant plants out of  <dig> total examined in the f <dig> . all of the pans <dig> tam <dig> double mutant plants showed an increase in viable pollen and seed set compared to the pans <dig> mutant, indicating genetic suppression of the male sterile phenotype of pans <dig> by a tam <dig> loss of function allele . the minority class of inviable pollen  observed in pans <dig> tam <dig> can be explained by the minority class of meiocytes that undergo meiosis ii in tam <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> genetics of pans <dig> interaction with tam <dig> and osd1

when pans <dig> was crossed to osd <dig> we failed to obtain any pans <dig> osd <dig> double mutants . the failure to obtain the pans <dig> osd <dig> double homozygous mutant is indicative of a synthetic lethal interaction between pans <dig> and osd <dig> and provides robust evidence that the two genes have related functions. to determine if the synthetic lethality is gametophytic or sporophytic we carried out reciprocal crosses between pans1/+ osd1/+ and wild type. in both crosses we obtained pans1/+ osd1/+ f <dig> plants indicating that both male and female pans <dig> osd <dig> gametes are viable and functional and that therefore the synthetic lethality is a sporophytic phenotype . however in the pans1/+ osd1/+ x wt cross, we observed a small but significant reduction in seed set  when compared to the wt x wt cross  in pans <dig>  and chromosomes showed a mixture of monopolar and bipolar attachment. in arabidopsis thaliana, rec <dig> and sister chromatid cohesion  <dig>  cohesins are required for both centromere cohesion as well as monopolar attachment of sister centromeres in meiosis i and atrec <dig> and atscc <dig> mutants show loss of centromere cohesion and bipolar attachment of sister kinetochores  <cit> . the occurrence of split sister centromere signals at metaphase i in a significant proportion of pans <dig> meiocytes is indicative of a difference in the closeness of connection between sister centromeres relative to wild type. chromosomes appear to show mixed segregation in this class of pans <dig> meiocytes. the reduced strength of centromeric cohesion in pans <dig> could possibly arise from a lowered amount of cohesin at the centromeric region. this possibility is supported by the formation of univalents that occurs sporadically in pans <dig> which is also observed in cohesin mutants  <cit> .

pans <dig> is expressed primarily in dividing cells and the protein localizes to the nucleus. nuclear localization of pans <dig> in cultured cells has also been described previously  <cit> . pans <dig> also shows expression during meiosis and the protein is present at early prophase i where it can be detected broadly across the nucleus but is excluded from the nucleolus. the protein signal declines late in prophase i at the diplotene stage. pans <dig> has two degradation motifs: a den-box and a d-box which have been shown to be important for its normal function  <cit> . the presence of the protein in prophase of meiosis i correlates with the partially penetrant phenotypic differences that we observed with regard to altered centromeric cohesion in a class of pans <dig> meiocytes at metaphase i.

sgo and pp2a are located at  centromeres to protect rec <dig> from cleavage by separase during meiosis i thereby preserving centromere cohesion in meiosis i  <cit> . pans <dig> on the other hand shows a broad distribution throughout the nucleus with a maximal signal found in prophase i and decreasing in late prophase. loading of apc/c at the centromeres by the spindle assembly checkpoint has been shown for mitosis in human cells and this may be the form that is relevant for control of cohesion at the centromere in plants as well  <cit> . the occurrence of pans <dig> throughout the nucleus in meiosis prophase i could reflect a role in other aspects of apc/c function  and pans <dig>  also called copper modified resistance  <dig>  has been shown to be involved in response to stress  <cit> . we did not detect pans <dig> protein in meiosis ii by immunostaining, however the possibility that a small amount of protein is still present in meiosis ii and regulates centromere cohesion during interkinesis is not ruled out. hence pans <dig> may function independently in both meiosis i  as well as in meiosis ii where it controls centromeric cohesion during interkinesis. alternatively pans <dig> may control levels of a factor in meiosis i that acts later during interkinesis to control centromeric cohesion. in fact as noted above, the timing of maximal pans <dig> expression precedes the onset of the meiosis i and meiosis ii phenotypes.

pans <dig> has been shown to interact with components of the apc/c cell division cycle 27b /hobbit and cell division cycle  <dig>    <cit>  as well, suggesting that it controls centromere organization and cohesion during meiosis through regulation of the apc/c. centromeric cohesion is resistant to dissolution by separase during meiosis i but not during meiosis ii. the difference is thought to be an intrinsic property of the chromosomes since placement of meiosis i chromosomes onto a meiosis ii spindle and vice versa does not change the behavior of the chromosomes  <cit> . one possible route of action of pans <dig> would be by specifically controlling factors such as separase, securin, shugoshin, pp2a, and wapl, that are responsible for protection or removal of cohesin  <cit> . a second possibility is that pans <dig> may control kinetochore proteins such as minchromosome segregation  <dig>  whose depletion in maize is known to lead to bipolar attachment  <cit> . alternatively, the loss of cohesion in pans <dig> may be a consequence of broader changes in regulation of the cell cycle arising from altered apc/c function affecting centromere properties. recent evidence from yeast has shown that deregulation of the cell cycle during meiotic prophase i leads to disruption in sister kinetochore co-orientation and in protection of centromere cohesion  <cit> . changes in regulation of the meiotic cell cycle could likewise be responsible for the centromere phenotypes in the case of pans <dig>  covering both meiotic divisions.

we found that pans <dig> shows synthetic lethality with osd <dig>  osd <dig> is required for entry into both meiosis i and meiosis ii divisions  <cit>  as well as for control of ploidy in mitosis  <cit>  and has been proposed to be an inhibitor of the apc/c, regulating both mitotic and meiotic progression as well as showing protein-protein interaction with apc/c activators including cdc <dig>  and cdc <dig> ,  <cit> . pans <dig> protein has also been shown to interact with the apc/c components cdc <dig> , and cdc27b although the same study did not identify osd <dig> in a tandem affinity purification experiment using pans <dig> as bait  <cit> . hence the interaction of pans <dig> with osd <dig> may be indirect and not at the protein-protein level. one explanation for the observed synthetic lethality between pans <dig> and osd <dig> is that pans <dig>  like osd <dig>  is an inhibitor of the apc/c and that loss of both osd <dig> and pans <dig> together leads to a highly deregulated apc/c that results in lethality.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that pans <dig> acts in meiosis i in addition to having a role in meiosis ii and that pans <dig> and osd <dig> are part of a network that links centromere cohesion and cell cycle progression through control of the apc/c via interactions with apc/c regulators and core apc/c components. our results highlight the importance of coordinated apc/c control for orchestration of chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression as well as cell viability.
