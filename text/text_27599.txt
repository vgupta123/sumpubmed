BACKGROUND
dinoflagellates are a group of single celled algae that compose a highly diversified phylum that displays an amazing range of ecological adaptation. different species employ autotrophy, heterotrophy or mixotrophy, many are known to be symbiotic or parasitic, and bioluminescence is common. they are found at all latitudes and are often a significant component of marine and freshwater phytoplankton communities. dinoflagellates are also notable for their unusual genome content and organization . estimates of dinoflagellate dna content range from  <dig> to  <dig> pg·cell- <dig>  <cit> , corresponding to approximately 3000– <dig>  mb . it has been suggested that polyploidy or polyteny may account for this large cellular dna content  <cit> , but studies of dna reassociation kinetics do not support this hypothesis. dinoflagellates have many chromosomes  that are permanently condensed and attached to the nuclear envelope during cell division  <cit> . dinoflagellates are the only eukaryotes with dna that contains 5-hydroxymethylmuracil, which replaces 12–70% of the thymidine  <cit> .

the unique physical features of the dinoflagellate chromosomes are likely to affect both gene transcription and regulation. while there is an increasing amount of expressed sequence tag information available for dinoflagellates, very few genes have been well characterized with respect to their gene structure and regulation. the few nuclear genes that have been isolated from genomic dna seem to uniformly lack typical eukaryotic transcriptional elements  and polyadenylation sites  <cit> . studies of dinoflagellate gene expression indicate that these organisms employ both transcriptional  regulation, with the iron superoxide dismutase of lingulodinium polyedrum exhibiting both modes, depending upon the stimulus  <cit> . recent results from microarray analysis of the dinoflagellate pyrocystis lunula indicate that approximately 3% of the transcripts included on the array exhibit transcriptional regulation  <cit> .

together, all of the above data suggests that the organization and regulation of dinoflagellate genes may be different from that of most other eukaryotes. early microscopic observations of the unusual dinoflagellate nuclear structure led to the hypothesis that dinoflagellates were "mesokaryotes", an intermediate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms  <cit> . however, molecular phylogenetic evidence has since clearly identified them as eukaryotes, and their phylogenetic placement supports loeblich's   <cit>  evolutionary interpretation that the unusual properties of dinoflagellate nuclei are derived and not representative of a mesokaryotic ancestral state. as such, our basic knowledge of eukaryotic genetics and gene expression could only be increased by understanding how  dinoflagellates structure their genes and regulate transcription within the sheer quantities of dna in their cells. to date, most of the data of gene regulation mechanisms in dinoflagellates has emerged sporadically, from studies of specific genes that are of interest for a particular function. the advent of genomic technologies, in particular global gene expression profiling methods, provides the ability to learn about many genes or transcripts simultaneously, even in uncharacterized systems like dinoflagellates. the application of transcriptional profiling to dinoflagellates, in conjunction with laboratory-based gene characterization, holds tremendous potential for understanding gene regulation in this unique and understudied group. in addition, the availability of broad-based gene expression data has the potential to greatly accelerate the pace of research and discovery for dinoflagellates, algae in general and eukaryotic systems as a whole.

this report describes a global and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome of a dinoflagellate. as a model we have used alexandrium fundyense, a species that is capable of producing potent neurotoxins, called saxitoxins, which are the causative agent of paralytic shellfish poisoning. the genus comprises approximately  <dig> different species that are found worldwide, and  <dig> of which are known to be toxic and cause so-called "red tides" or harmful algal blooms. this study examined gene expression in nutrient-stressed alexandrium cells using massively parallel signature sequencing , a proprietary technology developed by solexa, inc  <cit> . the method is similar to the well-known serial analysis of gene expression   <cit>  in that it acquires a short dna sequence from a defined position in each gene transcript. however, the depth of sampling with mpss is much greater, with the resulting data set containing at least  <dig> million, 17-nucleotide 'signature' sequences, making the technology sensitive to genes expressed at low levels.

the mpss method is "global" in that it provides quantitative expression information for the entire transcriptome. for uncharacterized organisms like dinoflagellates, mpss can provide a broader view of the transcriptome than microarray expression profiling, which generally includes only a portion of the transcripts present in a cell. statistical methods for the analysis of quantitative expression data have demonstrated that the mpss data are robust  <cit> . accepting an estimate of  <dig>  mrna molecules in an average eukaryotic cell, mpss constitutes a three-fold sampling of a single cell, allowing the identification, comparison and quantification of even rare transcripts. the resulting alexandrium mpss data provide a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of transcriptional regulation in dinoflagellates. comparison of the alexandrium results to those of other eukaryotes indicates that the distribution and abundance of signature sequences is quite similar in alexandrium, humans and arabidopsis. finally, identification of mpss signatures via sequencing provides insight into one mechanism that may contribute to the observed signature number in alexandrium.

RESULTS
physiological status of cells
cells were harvested for analysis at the point at which growth began to slow, at the transition between late logarithmic and stationary phases of growth . at this time, the limiting nutrient had been depleted for at least one day , resulting in nutrient starvation. the nutrient status of the cells was also reflected in their cellular toxin content , which was decreasing in the n-starved culture  and increasing in the p-starved culture . this increment or decrement in toxin content under p- or n-starved conditions, respectively, has been well documented for this organism . at the time of harvest, p-starved cells contained approximately ten times more toxin than the n-starved cells.

mpss signature abundances
an mpss library was generated for each of the nutrient conditions . four sequencing runs were performed for each sample, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> successful sequences for the n/ <dig> library and  <dig> , <dig> successful sequences for the p/ <dig> library . from the complete sequence sets,  <dig>  distinct signatures were observed in the n/ <dig> library, with  <dig>  distinct signatures in the p/ <dig> library. the signature sets were filtered to remove any signatures that were 1) not reliable: observed in only one sequencing run, and 2) not significant: never observed at or above  <dig> tpm in either library. of the  <dig>  unique signatures in the complete sequence set, 33%  did not meet the reliability criterion. the significance filter removed an additional  <dig> signatures. after filtering, the final set of "reliable and significant" signatures comprised  <dig>  signatures for n/ <dig> and  <dig>  signatures for p/ <dig>  for the purposes of this analysis, we are concerned only with these reliable and significant signatures and will hereafter refer to them simply as "signatures", reserving the term significant to refer to the statistical analysis of differences in gene expression. when the data from the two libraries was combined, a total of  <dig>  non-redundant signatures were observed. of these,  <dig>  were not observed in the p/ <dig> library and  <dig>  were not present in the n/ <dig> library.

mpss signature distributions
the distribution of signature abundances across both libraries was generally quite similar . only  <dig> % of all signatures –  <dig> signatures in the n/ <dig> library and  <dig> signatures in the p/ <dig> library – were present at greater than  <dig>  tpm . the three most abundant signatures in both libraries constituted  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total sequences ; all other high abundance signatures were less than  <dig> % of sequences. of the signatures present in a given library, the vast majority, 93% of p/ <dig> and 95% of n/ <dig>  were found at less than  <dig> % abundance . of the total signatures, 12% of them were not found in the n/ <dig> library, whereas almost  <dig> times as many  were absent from the p/ <dig> library.

differential expression of mpss signatures
for those signatures which were present in both libraries, their relative abundance between the two conditions – the expression ratio – varied widely, from  <dig> to greater than  <dig> . almost half of all signatures  were condition-specific, in that they were found only in one library and absent from the other . another  <dig> % of signatures were constantly expressed, defined by meyers et al.   <cit>  as those signatures with a summed abundance within a two-fold range . only  <dig> % of all signatures  were found in both libraries and showed a two-fold or greater difference in expression. of these,  <dig> % had expression ratios between  <dig> and  <dig>  and only a small percentage of signatures, 4%, showed more than a five-fold difference in expression level between the two libraries.

signature abundance was also compared statistically between the two libraries using a z-test  <cit> , with the resulting statistical significance expressed as a p-value. the expression of  <dig>  signatures was significantly different at p <  <dig> . of those  <dig>  signatures, approximately half  remained significant at p <  <dig> , and at p <  <dig>  only  <dig> signatures showed statistically significant differences in expression . despite having statistical support, approximately 6% of the signatures with significant differences in expression would nonetheless be considered constantly expressed, exhibiting expression ratios <  <dig> . the majority of differentially expressed signatures  are those that are condition-specific, i.e. their expression is zero in one of the libraries. about 30% of these signatures at each significance level are common to both libraries.

race amplification using mpss signatures
we synthesized oligonucleotide primers matching  <dig> of the mpss signatures, in order to generate longer fragments via pcr for sequencing and potential transcript identification. this strategy is similar to that described as rast-pcr using sage tags  <cit> , and as glgi-mpss using mpss tags  <cit> , and also to the widely used rapid amplification of cdna ends . for race amplification, we chose  <dig> types of signatures: the most highly expressed signatures found only in the n/ <dig> library , the most highly expressed signatures found only in the p/ <dig> library , signatures with the greatest relative expression in the n/ <dig> library , signatures with the greatest relative expression in the p/ <dig> library , and signatures that were very highly expressed in both libraries. these  <dig> signatures exhibited tpm values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> 

two separate rounds of race amplification were performed, with  <dig> out of the  <dig> signatures  generating a product in one or both rounds. product sizes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs, exclusive of the poly tract . seven reactions produced multiple amplicons that exhibited widely differing database matches and thus no definitive identification could be made. of the remaining  <dig> signatures, all produced a single product as assessed by gel electrophoresis. sequences of all except  <dig> of the  <dig> exhibited high similarity, at the nucleotide level, to ests recently collected from alexandrium tamarense  <cit> . further identification was achieved through translated searches of the genbank database;  <dig> race products matched known dinoflagellate genes, one had no similarities to known proteins, and two showed homology to non-dinoflagellate genes.

sequence variants of only three known dinoflagellate genes accounted for more than half of the signatures that could be identified . four of the  <dig> signatures matched the luciferin-binding protein gene  of the dinoflagellate lingulodinium polyedrum. these include the second and ninth most abundant signatures overall; all four signatures are more abundant in the p/ <dig> library. four of the  <dig> signatures matched the histone-like protein genes  known from the dinoflagellates crypthecodinium cohnii and lingulodinium polyedrum. these race sequences are also more distantly related to the histone-like protein sequence  identified by taroncher-oldenburg and anderson   <cit>  in this same organism, sharing homology only in the central domain of the protein. all four of the signatures matching histone-like protein transcripts are more highly expressed in the p/ <dig> library; one of them is the third most abundant signature and the other three are unique to the p/ <dig> library. one of the  <dig> signatures produced a race product that matched the s-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase gene  first identified in a. fundyense by taroncher-oldenburg and anderson   <cit> . this signature was more highly expressed in the n/ <dig> library and was derived from an upstream dpnii site. the signature including the downstream 3'-end dpnii site matched one of the race primers that did not produce a product . this signature was the fifth most abundant signature overall.

the remaining six signatures that were identified each mapped to a different gene. one of these signatures was unique to the p/ <dig> library and showed homology to the ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase gene of arabidopsis thaliana. two of the six signatures were moderately expressed and more abundant in the p/ <dig> library; these showed homology to a light-harvesting protein gene from the dinoflagellate heterocapsa triquetra and the cytochrome b gene of the dinoflagellate pfiesteria piscicida. the other three signatures of the six were expressed at low levels in only the n/ <dig> library. these signatures were homologous to the dinoflagellate peridinin-chlorophyll a-binding protein, a seed storage protein, and an a. tamarense est.

for most of the signatures, multiple sequence variants were observed amongst the multiple clones of each product that were sequenced. for example, the race product generated by signature # <dig> appeared as a single band on an agarose gel, was cloned and  <dig> clones were sequenced. all  <dig> of the sequences matched lbp, but the sequences themselves varied in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bases, and contained sequence variations ranging from 1– <dig> indels to 1– <dig> base pair changes. thus, in the race reactions, we observed both multiple signatures mapping to the same gene, as well as multiple sequence variants of one gene carrying the same signature.

discussion
alexandrium signature content
we have utilized mpss to examine gene expression in alexandrium cells grown under widely differing physiological conditions, where both nutrient status and toxicity vary. the results of this analysis provide a global view of the transcriptome and its regulation in these unusual single-celled eukaryotes. the number of unique signatures in alexandrium is quite comparable to the values observed in humans and arabidopsis, two other eukaryotes that have been analyzed using mpss: ~ <dig> – <dig>  signatures per library in alexandrium, compared to ~ <dig> – <dig>  in humans and ~ <dig> – <dig>  in arabidopsis   <cit> . thus, if the mpss signature number provides a "rough first estimate of the complexity of gene expression"  <cit> , alexandrium exhibits significant transcriptional complexity, on par with multicellular eukaryotes.

because dinoflagellates contain so much cellular dna, yet so little is known about their gene content and organization, it may be tempting to make inferences about gene number based upon signature number. however, even the few paired data available on the number of genes and mpss signatures  show the relationship between the two values to be unpredictable. studies that have matched expression tags  to their corresponding transcripts from genome and est sequencing projects  have revealed a number of reasons why each unique signature does not necessarily correspond to a unique chromosomal gene. some signatures arise from non-chromosomal genes, primarily mitochondrial or ribosomal transcripts, or from sequencing error. a single gene may produce more than one signature sequence due to alternative splicing, alternative 3' termination and polyadenylation, or cleavage at an upstream restriction site on different mrna copies. signatures may be derived from antisense transcripts. each gene may not produce a unique signature because the transcript may not contain the restriction site, or the site may be too close to the polya tail to produce a meaningful signature. two  transcripts may also share the same signature sequence by chance alone. many of these processes are operating in dinoflagellates, arabidopsis and humans. however, alternative splicing, which contributes to transcriptome diversification, is thought to occur at a much lower rate in unicellular eukaryotes than in multicellular eukaryotes  <cit> . nonetheless, for all of these reasons it is problematic to make inferences about gene content based solely upon mpss signature numbers.

signature abundance distribution and expression in alexandrium
the abundance distribution of alexandrium signatures is quite typical of other eukaryotes examined. the vast majority of the signatures  are present at less than  <dig> % abundance , indicating that most genes are expressed at very low levels. if we assume that a cell contains an average of  <dig>  mrna molecules  <cit> , this corresponds to less than  <dig> copies per cell. in eukaryotes, the vast majority  of mrna sequences are present at less than  <dig> copies per cell, with very few sequences present in a high abundance class that constitutes about one-fifth of the cellular rna  <cit> . the alexandrium signature abundance data show this same classic profile, and other recent work using sage and mpss has confirms the generality of this abundance pattern. zhang et al.   <cit>  found that 86% of transcripts identified via sage were present at less than  <dig> copies per cell, and only  <dig> % of all transcripts were found at > <dig> copies per cell. mpss analysis of cultured human cell lines showed only  <dig> signatures with greater than  <dig>  tpm abundance, with ~90% of signatures present at less than  <dig> tpm  <cit> . in a variety of arabidopsis tissues analyzed by mpss, more than two-thirds of signatures are present at less than  <dig> tpm  <cit> .

the extent of expression regulation also shows similarities between alexandrium and arabidopsis, an organism that has been subject to extensive mpss analysis  <cit> . in both organisms, about half of all signatures are shared between conditions, and roughly half of those are constantly expressed. of the shared genes that are differentially regulated, the expression ratios range from  <dig> to almost  <dig>  these data demonstrate quite clearly that dinoflagellates commonly employ transcriptional regulation of their genes. even at the most stringent significance values used in table  <dig>  approximately 10% of total signatures show differential regulation. this is about three times higher than that observed in microarray analyses of pyrocystis lunula  <cit> , where approximately 3% of their targets showed expression differences. the difference in the magnitude of differential expression is likely due to multiple factors. the pyrocystis studies used short-term  exposures to their experimental conditions versus the longer  exposure to nutrient stress in this study, and the proportion of genes regulated on these varying time scales may be very different. in addition, the sampling depth of mpss detects more low copy number genes and smaller expression differences, which would contribute to the greater number of differentially expressed transcripts in the mpss data.

race analysis of mpss signatures
the abundance and distribution of the alexandrium signatures is very similar to that of other eukaryotes that have been analyzed. the results of the race analysis of mpss signatures, however, suggest a mechanism that may be more common in dinoflagellates and would contribute to the transcriptional complexity of alexandrium. we hypothesize that dinoflagellates exhibit an increased tendency for genes to occur in multiple copies such as long tandem repeats. this could easily increase signature diversity if the repeats are not exact copies of one another, but instead contain sequence differences at or near their 3' restriction sites. this is evident from the race results, where only three dinoflagellate genes are responsible for  <dig> of the mapped signatures – luciferin-binding protein, sahh and histone-like protein. in addition, many of the signatures produced multiple sequence variants amongst the cloned race products, indicating the presence of yet more copies of the gene in question. for example, the four mpss signatures that matched lbp comprised  <dig> different sequence variants in total.

the mpss and race data provide a global view of a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly apparent in the literature of dinoflagellate gene content and regulation: the presence of widespread gene duplication in these organisms. one of the earliest descriptions of a cloned gene in dinoflagellates – the lbp of lingulodinium polyedrum – reported the presence of ~ <dig> copies of this gene in the genome  <cit> . the gene encoding the peridinin-chlorophyll a-binding protein  of this same species was documented to occur as ~ <dig> copies arranged in long tandem repeats  <cit> , making pcp one of the most highly repeated protein-coding genes ever reported. tandem repeat organization of ~ <dig> copies has been described for the luciferase gene  of l. polyedrum  <cit> , and ~ <dig> copies of a camp-dependent protein kinase gene have been found in this organism  <cit> . the ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase  gene in another species of dinoflagellate, prorocentrum minimum, also exists in multiple copies but with different gene organization. the rubisco genes are arranged in about  <dig> transcribed units, each containing four copies of the coding region  <cit> . dinoflagellate mitochondrial genes exhibit similar sequence variation; the genes for cytochrome oxidase subunit i  and apocytochrome b  occur as multiple copies in several species  <cit> . the cob, cox <dig> and cox <dig> genes may exist as polyadenylated yet random fragments in the mitochondria, sometimes with two to four short dna fragments, either from the same gene or different genes, attached together and co-translated  <cit> .

the growing number of expressed sequence tag  collections for a variety of dinoflagellate species also shows evidence of multicopy genes. in the dinoflagellate karenia brevis, 40% of the est gene clusters showed single nucleotide polymorphisms , indicating the presence of multiple copies of those genes  <cit> . snps have been observed at a similar rate in est libraries from both amphidinium carterae and l. polyedrum  <cit> . a collection of  <dig> unique est sequences has been generated for alexandrium tamarense, a member of the same species complex as a. fundyense  <cit> . clustering of their ests revealed multiple sequences for hlp, lbp, pcp, atp synthase, light harvesting protein, rubisco, cytochrome c <dig>  elongation factor 1-alpha, as well as several unknown and potentially dinoflagellate-specific proteins.

while est and other sequence data provide ample support for the duplication of multiple genes in dinoflagellates, it does not appear that dinoflagellates have simply duplicated their entire genome. studies of dna reassociation kinetics in dinoflagellates  <cit>  indicate that their genomes contain roughly 50% repetitive dna, which is commensurate with eukaryotes in general and argues against polyploidy or polyteny. furthermore, population genetic studies of dinoflagellates using microsatellite markers have revealed only single alleles, supporting their status as haploid during vegetative growth  <cit> . the presence of multiple copies of many genes does provide some explanation for the large genomes of dinoflagellates, where dna content ranges from approximately  <dig> pg of dna·cell- <dig> to more than  <dig> pg·cell- <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the mpss data indicate that alexandrium exhibits significant transcriptional complexity, comparable to humans and arabidopsis. furthermore, dinoflagellates seem to be quite similar to multicellular eukaryotes in terms of signature abundance, distribution, and expression. this includes the observation that expression of a significant number of signatures are differentially regulated, whereas previous studies of dinoflagellate gene regulation implicated translational control as the primary mechanism. the results of signature mapping via race add to the growing body of evidence for widespread gene duplication in dinoflagellates, which would contribute to the transcriptional complexity of this organism. furthermore, extensive duplication of many genes does provide one mechanism for the expansion of the dinoflagellate genome without invoking wholesale genome duplication, although it is unlikely that gene duplication is responsible for the total dna content of dinoflagellates. the question still remains, however, as to the underlying mechanism for the expansion of individual genes in dinoflagellates.
