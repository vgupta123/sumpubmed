BACKGROUND
small nucleolar rnas  are a special class of small non coding rnas localized to the nucleolus. they belong to two major categories; box c/d and box h/aca snornas, based on the presence of short consensus sequence motifs
 <cit> . h/aca box snornas guide the pseudouridylation while c/d box snornas guide the site specific 2'-o-ribose methylation during post transcriptional modification of pre rrna
 <cit> . such modification is accomplished by complementary base pairing between specific regions of the snorna and target rna by the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex which guides the modification of target rna. some snornas are also known to perform functions other than the modification of ribosomal rnas, e.g. u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig>  the u <dig> snorna is an exceptional member of the box c/d class, and is involved in early pre rrna cleavage in the 5’ external transcribed spacer  in yeast cells
 <cit> , mouse extracts
 <cit> , and xenopus oocyte extracts
 <cit> . depletion of this snorna impairs the formation of mature 18 s rrna
 <cit> . other exceptions include c/d snorna u8
 <cit> , u22
 <cit>  and an h/aca snorna u17/snr30
 <cit>  which are required for pre-rrna cleavage. they are not involved in rrna and nuclear rna modification. some snornas are involved in both pre-rrna cleavage as well as modification e.g. u <dig> 
 <cit>  and snr <dig> 
 <cit> . several snornas lack any known target site, and are called orphan snornas. these snornas might have undiscovered functions, which may or may not concern rrnas. evidence in this respect is the role of orphan c/d box snorna  in regulation of alternative splicing
 <cit> .

structural motifs are one of the important distinguishing features of snornas. the characteristic structural motifs in c/d box snornas are rugauga for c box and cuga for d box. in h/aca box snornas the h box is ananna and aca box is aca, arranged in a hairpin, hinge, hairpin, tail structure
 <cit> . c/d box snornas are about 60– <dig> bases in size, while h/aca snornas are 120– <dig> bases. vertebrate snornas are typically encoded from introns of protein coding genes
 <cit>  while in plants they are transcribed as polycistronic transcripts
 <cit> . in yeast most of them are transcribed from independent promoters
 <cit> . amongst protozoan parasites, snornas have been extensively studied in trypanosoma brucei <cit>  and plasmodium falciparum <cit> . in the latter it was shown for the first time that snorna genes may be located in utrs. strikingly, both organisms showed a much larger number of methylation sites compared with pseudouridylation sites.

a number of bioinformatic tools are available for the scanning of genomic sequences for snornas. these include snoscan
 <cit>  and snoseeker 
 <cit>  for the search of c/d and h/aca box snornas. in this study, we have carried out a genome wide analysis of the early branching parasitic protist entamoeba histolytica for identification of c/d and h/aca box snornas in this organism. a computational search for structural motifs gave hits out of which false positives having no identifiable target sites were removed. this was achieved by aligning the rrna of e. histolytica with rrnas of five eukaryotic organisms arabidopsis thaliana, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, saccharomyces cerevisiae and homo sapiens separately, whose snornas and target sites are already known
 <cit> . the computational analysis was combined with experimental validation.

RESULTS
computational identification of putative snornas from e. histolytica by snoscan and snoseeker
target site modifications by snornas are commonly conserved amongst distant eukaryotes
 <cit> . we therefore selected five eukaryotic organisms: a. thaliana, c. elegans, d. melanogaster, s. cerevisiae, h. sapiens, whose methylation sites and pseudouridylation  sites are known and used these to find putative sites in e. histolytica rrna by aligning its  <dig>  s, 28 s and 18 s rrna sequences with rrnas of the selected organisms separately . each of the mapped methylation and psi sites were picked as putative modification sites in e. histolytica. we could identify a total of  <dig> putative methylation sites and  <dig> putative psi sites in e. histolytica. a large fraction of these  matched with yeast and human sites.  <dig> novel methylation sites were also found in e. histolytica. the programs snoscan and snoseeker ; and snoseeker  were used to identify the putative sequences for c/d and h/aca box snornas respectively in e. histolytica whole genome. the initially predicted snornas  were further analyzed to eliminate false positive candidates using the following criteria . firstly, we selected snornas that could target the putative modification sites obtained by aligning the rrna of e. histolytica with the five organisms listed above. snornas that could potentially target  <dig> predicted methyl sites and 41 psi sites in e. histolytica were thus selected. secondly, we set a threshold value, the final logarithmic odd score, that incorporated information from each of the snorna features and fetched out the snornas having final score equal or more than the threshold value
 <cit> . the threshold values used are given in “methods”. thirdly; we looked for the genomic localization of these snornas and selected those coming from intergenic regions and introns. we also selected snornas from genic regions for which the logarithmic odd score was well above the threshold 
 <cit> . lastly, we did blastn analysis of predicted snornas with est database of e. histolytica. all those snornas giving hits with ests were discarded. finally we obtained a total of  <dig> snornas of which  <dig> were c/d box  and  <dig> were h/aca box . we have named the genes encoding the putative snornas so as to indicate firstly the type of snorna , followed by species name  and the modification site in rrna  or orphan , e.g. aca-eh-ssu- <dig> represents h/aca type of snorna of e. histolytica which is predicted to modify ssu rrna at position  <dig> .

we compared the predicted e. histolytica snornas with those of s. cerevisiae <cit> , h. sapiens <cit>  and the two protozoan parasites  on the basis of homology with conserved antisense sequences that guide the respective modifications for the two snorna classes . we found 9 c/d guide snornas out of  <dig> which showed homology with p. falciparum snornas, and 10/ <dig> which showed homology with t. brucei snornas, while in yeast and human this number was 14/ <dig>  and 11/ <dig> . only  <dig> e. histolytica h/aca box snornas out of  <dig> showed homology with p. falciparum snornas and 2/ <dig> showed homology with t. brucei snornas, while the homology with yeast was 14/ <dig> and with human was 18/ <dig>  the conservation of modification sites between these organisms was as follows. of the sites predicted to be modified in e. histolytica rrnas ,  <dig> methylation sites and  <dig> pseudouridylation sites were conserved in at least one of the other four organisms . taking the two modification sites together,  <dig> sites were conserved between e. histolytica and s. cerevisiae,  <dig> between e. histolytica and h. sapiens,  <dig> sites between e. histolytica and p. falciparum, and  <dig> sites were conserved between e. histolytica and t. brucei. seven modification sites of e. histolytica were shared by all the four organisms. we also found  <dig> and  <dig> orphan snornas in the c/d and h/aca categories respectively. orphan snornas are important as they may act on rna substrates other than mature rrnas. as mentioned before, one of the roles of orphan snornas is reported for human hbii- <dig> snorna
 <cit> , which is a c/d orphan snorna and regulates alternative splicing of the serotonin receptor 2 c. similarly, some orphan h/aca box snornas may function in other aspects of rna biogenesis. for example, the human u <dig> box h/aca snorna and its yeast orthologue, snr <dig>  plays an essential role in the nucleolytic processing of 18 s rrna from pre rrna. we checked for sequence complementarity of the antisense elements in our predicted orphan snornas with the e. histolytica data base. for two c/d orphan snornas  the possible antisense element  showed complementary base paring with mrnas of ehi_ <dig> and ehi_ <dig> genes in e. histolytica. further we checked whether the predicted orphan snornas were found in the small rna data base of e. histolytica . we found that  <dig> of  <dig> orphan snornas were detected in this data base.

note: snorna of e. histolytica and its homolog in yeast , human , p. falciparum  and t. brucei  is shown with their conserved modification sites.

all of the predicted e. histolytica snornas possessed conserved structural motifs characteristic of each class. secondary structure of the predicted h/aca snornas was determined by acaseeker. all of the predicted 58 h/aca snornas adopted the consensus folding pattern as shown using varna: visualization applet for rna
 <cit> . a representative of h/aca snorna is shown in additional file
3: figure s <dig> a. as expected the h/aca box snornas formed hairpin-hinge-hairpin-tail structure with h box lying in hinge region and aca box at 3' tail region. unlike acaseeker, the c/d box prediction tool did not provide the secondary structure information. therefore the secondary structure of c/d box was predicted with rna fold  and structures were drawn using varna: visualization applet for rna. secondary structures obtained for c/d box snornas were similar to the published structures for these rnas .

the genome sequence of other entamoeba species is now becoming available. we checked these data bases to look for close matches to the predicted snornas of e. histolytica. of the  <dig> predicted h/aca snornas we found  <dig> in e. dispar and  <dig> in e. nuttalli, while of the  <dig> predicted c/d box rnas we found  <dig> in e. dispar and  <dig> in e. nuttalli. there was a high level of sequence similarity , which was expected with e. dispar and e. nuttalli since they are very closely related to e. histolytica <cit> . however when the same analysis was done with a distant species e. invadens, which infects reptiles, we found only 1 h/aca and 2 c/d snornas matching with e. histolytica. although this result could also be a reflection of the quality of sequence assembly, it shows that e. invadens has diverged significantly from e. histolytica. sequence comparison of conserved genes, e.g. rrna genes also shows high divergence between e. histolytica and e. invadens <cit> .

validation of computationally predicted snornas by rt-pcr and northern hybridization
to demonstrate whether the predicted snornas are indeed expressed in e. histolytica cells we selected  <dig> snornas to represent different categories, namely guide/orphan; and gene location in genic/intergenic regions. accordingly 8 c/d box guide and orphan snornas were selected  as also the u <dig> snorna; and 15 h/aca box guide and orphan snornas were selected . expression analysis of these snornas was performed by rt-pcr using total rna from e. histolytica and specific primers for each snorna designed from the ends of the predicted snorna sequence . rt-pcr products were obtained for all snornas tested . amplicons of predicted size  were observed for all c/d box snornas and most of the h/aca box snornas. for three of the h/aca snornas somewhat smaller size amplicons were observed . a possible explanation for this is provided later. to further validate the rt-pcr results northern blot analysis was performed with rna enriched in small rna species. dna probes from four c/d box and nine h/aca box snornas tested by rt-pcr were used. results showed detectable bands corresponding to all snornas tested , although intensities of bands were not the same for all, possibly reflecting differential expression levels. for the four c/d box snornas and u <dig> snorna tested, the sizes of observed bands were consistent with the predicted sizes . however several of the h/aca snornas showed bands in addition to the predicted sizes. these bands may represent mature snornas obtained after processing, as has been reported in other species
 <cit> . some of these processing events may involve splicing of internal sequences, resulting in shorter size amplicons in rt-pcr. the multiple bands observed in some of the h/aca snornas indicate that these may be present as both single and double hairpin rnas, as is known in other species
 <cit> . on the other hand, northern blot analysis of aca-eh-ssu <dig> indicates the existence of double hairpin h/aca snorna alone in this case; while aca-eh-ssu <dig>  aca-eh-ssu <dig>  aca-eh-lsu <dig> and acaehorph <dig> seem to exist as single hairpin alone. thus, the experimental analysis using rt-pcr and northern blotting demonstrate that the snorna predictions by computational analysis are indeed valid and correspond to authentic snorna genes.

genomic organization of snornas in e. histolytica
the genomic location of all snornas  was determined . the majority  of snorna genes mapped to intergenic regions, while 20% mapped to protein-coding regions where snornas were encoded either from the opposite strand of the protein coding gene  or from the same strand . a small number of snorna genes were located in other parts of protein-coding genes, e.g. in the 5’-utr , 3’-utr , and intron . 4% of the genes mapped to non annotated regions . we checked for proximity of snorna genes with protein-coding genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, e.g. ribosomal protein genes and genes encoding nucleolar-localized proteins. a gene was considered proximal if it was found within 1 kb of the snorna gene. of the  <dig> intergenically-located snorna genes,  <dig> were found close to ribosomal protein genes. of  <dig> genically-located snorna genes  <dig> were found close to ribosomal protein genes and  <dig> was close to the gene for fibrillarin, a component of the c/d box snornp, while of  <dig> snorna genes located in utr  <dig> was located close to ribosomal protein gene . me-eh-lsu-u1176a was present close to rrna methyltransferase gene. therefore a substantial number of snorna genes were physically close to genes of related function. the remaining snorna genes were located close to functionally diverse genes, e.g. genes involved in cellular signal transduction, dna -methyltransferase gene, heat shock genes etc. when the genomic location of e. histolytica snorna genes was compared with that of other organisms, some striking similarities were observed. for example, the h/aca snorna aca-eh-ssu <dig> is localized to the orf of a hypothetical protein and encoded from its opposite strand. interestingly the yeast h/aca snorna snr <dig>  which is homologous to aca-eh-ssu <dig> is also located in an orf for a hypothetical protein and expressed form the opposite strand
 <cit> . like in e. histolytica, several of the drosophila snorna genes are located in the coding strand of a host gene. it was proposed that in such cases alternative splicing may occur, giving rise to two different rna species, exhibiting different functions, from the same pre-mrna; an mrna translated into a protein, and a small non-messenger rna  functioning as the snorna
 <cit> . a striking feature in p. falciparum is that some of the snorna genes are located in the 3’-utrs. this feature was found in e. histolytica also, where  <dig> snorna genes were localized to 3’-utrs. additionally  <dig> snorna genes were also found in 5’-utrs- a feature not reported in any other system so far. although we have not experimentally validated the assignment of snorna genes to utrs, these assignments are likely to be correct since we found that snorna genes overlapped with protein-coding region of the gene as well as the utr. in one case  we have validated the presence of this snorna by rt-pcr as well as northern blotting.

snorna genes in other organisms are known to be present both in single and multiple copies, and some may also be in clusters. in e. histolytica we found that 80% of the genes were single copy while the rest were in multiple copies. our data shows that at least in two instances the snorna genes may be present in clusters and may be co-transcribed. 1) the snorna genes aca-eh-ssu <dig> and aca-eh- <dig>  s <dig> are 126 bp apart and are transcribed from the opposite strand of ehi_ <dig> gene. due to their proximity and presence in the opposite strand of the same gene, it is likely that these two genes may be transcribed together and may exist in a cluster. 2) the four identical copies of aca-eh-lsu2997a snorna genes  are separated from one another by a sequence of 206–214 bp, which is also identical in the four copies. we tried to locate promoters in the 206–214 bp intergenic region of these snorna genes using bioinformatic tools  but did not find any promoters. the upstream region of the very first copy of snorna may have a promoter but this could not be checked computationally as this region was right at the start of the scaffold. it is possible that these four genes may be co-transcribed as a single unit  and may constitute a cluster.

structural features of e. histolytica box h/aca and box c/d snornas
h/aca snornas typically fold into a characteristic hairpin-hinge-hairpin-tail structure in which base-paired stems alternate with single-stranded regions . the h box is located at the hinge and the aca box is located at the 3' tail,  <dig> nt away from the 3' end of the snorna
 <cit> . the site for guiding uridine modification of the target rna is always located 14– <dig> nts upstream of the h box and/or the aca box
 <cit> . this guide site consists of 8– <dig> base stretch which is complementary to the target rna. it is located in an internal bulge or recognition loop in each hairpin and contacts the target rna containing the unpaired uridine to be modified. each h/aca snorna can guide the modification of one uridine or two uridines which may be located in the same or different target rnas. thus the h/aca snorna may contain only one or both functional loops. in e. histolytica all the h/aca snornas  adopted the hairpin-hinge-hairpin-tail structure. some variations were observed, e.g. in some cases the guide sequence may extend into the adjoining p <dig> and p <dig> stems flanking the recognition loop 
 <cit> . of  <dig> guide h/aca snornas in e. histolytica,  <dig> snornas  possessed both the functional antisense regions which can either guide the same or different substrate rrnas. for example, aca-eh-ssu <dig> is predicted to guide the modification of uridine in 18 s rrna at  <dig> different positions,  <dig> and 1114; whereas, aca-eh-lsu <dig> can guide the modification of uridine at position  <dig> in 18 s and at position  <dig> in 28 s rrna . three h/aca snornas show potential of directing two pseudouridylations by a single guide sequence , as has been reported in other organisms e.g. aca <dig> in human
 <cit> . it is proposed that rnas get folded into alternate structures thus targeting multiple sites. overall we found 41 psi sites guided by 43 h/aca guide snornas. we also found some sites which may be subjected to both methylation as well as pseudouridylation. in human, u <dig> position of 28 s rrna is subjected to methylation as well as pseudouridylation
 <cit> . similarly in e. histolytica, the residue lsu <dig> could be guided by c/d box snornas me-eh-lsu-u1176a, me-eh-lsu-u1176b and me-eh-lsu-u1176c as well as by an h/aca box snorna: aca-eh-lsu <dig>  the target site corresponding to lsu <dig> is known to get methylated in arabidopsis thaliana  and pseudouridylated in s. cerevisiae 
 <cit> . similarly the  <dig>  s <dig> site could be guided by c/d box snorna me-eh- <dig>  s-u <dig> as well as h/aca box snorna aca-eh- <dig>  s <dig> 

note: box h and box aca are depicted in bold. antisense elements are in italics.

the c/d box snornas typically possess the conserved boxes c  and d  near the 5' and 3' ends, respectively
 <cit> . a short region upstream of c box and downstream of d box usually shows base complementarity. base-pairing in this region brings the c and d boxes close together. in addition to c and d boxes, some snornas of this class also possess c' and d' boxes which are less conserved and form a folded structure in the order 5’-c/d'/c'/d-3’. the 2'-o-ribose methylation of the target rna is guided by one or two 10-21nt antisense elements located upstream of the d and/or d' boxes in a manner such that the modified base is paired with the snorna nucleotide located precisely 5nts upstream of the d or d' box
 <cit> . all 41 c/d box snornas in e. histolytica had the conserved motifs: c box and d box. the c box had the consensus sequence ruga g. the sequence of d box in two of the c/d box snorna genes me-eh-lsu-u3580b and me-eh-ssu-u <dig> was auga. all of the other snorna genes possessed the consensus cuga sequence in the d box. 71% of these rnas possessed the d’ box as well . the d' box is much less conserved and it varied from cuga to caga, uuga, auga, acca and ccga. all the c/d box snornas possessed at least one antisense element upstream to either the d’ box or d box. me-eh-ssu-a <dig> snorna gene had two antisense elements and was able to guide different target sites of the same or different rrnas  whereas me-eh-ssu-g <dig> and me-eh-ssu-a <dig> had single antisense element upstream to d’ box which could guide multiple sites for methylation in different rrnas ). five c/d box snornas with a single antisense stretch in each were predicted to target different sites in the same target rna ). from the predicted folding pattern 60% c/d box snornas possessed the terminal stem while the rest either lacked it or had an external stem, or an internal stem
 <cit> .

computational identification and validation of multiple copies of u <dig> snorna in e. histolytica
u <dig> snorna belongs to the c/d box snorna category and performs the specialized function of site specific cleavage of rrna during pre-rrna processing. it is present in all eukaryotic organisms either as a single copy or in multiple copies
 <cit> . blastn analysis of yeast and human u <dig> snorna with e. histolytica whole genome revealed the presence of  <dig> copies of u <dig> snorna  in e. histolytica. these were 97-99% identical to each other and ranged in size from 209– <dig> nt. all copies were located in intergenic regions  and their sequences are given in table
7b. the characteristic boxes- box gac, a’, a, c, b, box c and box d of e. histolytica u <dig> snorna were conserved  when compared with u <dig> snornas of selected organisms . the eh_u <dig> snorna was well conserved with respect to t. brucei and t. cruzi <cit> . however, it showed poor homology with p. falciparum u <dig> snorna
 <cit> . sequence conservation was greater at 5’ end up to central hinge domain, with less conservation in the 3’ hairpin region. we checked for the conservation of u <dig> snorna among entamoeba species and found  <dig> copies of u <dig> snorna with 91% identity in e. dispar  and  <dig> copy with 96% identity in e. nuttalli. no homology was observed for e. invadens. to validate the predicted u <dig> snorna in e. histolytica we did rt-pcr and northern blotting with total rna . rt-pcr was performed using specific primers for u <dig> snornas . the predicted and the observed sizes as obtained by both rt-pcr and northern were the same. the sequencing of one of the clones of the rt-pcr product confirmed the presence of eh_u3e copy of u <dig> snorna.

CONCLUSIONS
ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells requires the activity of a highly conserved set of small rnas, the snornas. in this study we show that the parasitic protist, e. histolytica, thought to be an early branching eukaryote, possesses the major classes of snornas as judged by sequence conservation with yeast and human. these rnas are expressed at fairly high levels as they are readily detectable by northern blots. it is relevant to ask whether e. histolytica, being a human parasite, has evolved any snorna features uniquely shared by other parasitic protozoa infecting humans. amongst these organisms, studies on snornas have mainly been reported with p. falciparum and t. brucei. when the features of e. histolytica snornas are compared with these organisms, the following points emerge. both in p. falciparum and e. histolytica some snorna genes are located in the 3’- utr, a property not reported in any other organism except drosophila <cit>  where an h/aca-like snorna is reported to be present in 3’ utr. in addition, some e. histolytica snorna genes are also found in the 5'-utr which is unique to this organism so far. both in p. falciparum and e. histolytica most  snorna genes are present in single copy whereas in t. brucei most of the snorna clusters are repeated in the genome with few clusters carrying single copy genes
 <cit> . the clustering of snorna genes is frequent in p. falciparum and t. brucei. we have reported two instances in e. histolytica where these genes may be clustered. unlike p. falciparum where  <dig> snorna genes are found in introns, we could locate only one snorna gene in an intron, while the majority of them were in intergenic regions, whereas no intronic snorna has been reported in t. brucei so far. like t. brucei, e. histolytica also possesses single hairpin h/aca snornas which are likely to be processed from a double hairpin pre-h/aca snorna into single hairpin snornas, whereas in p. falciparum single hairpin h/aca snorna has not been reported. unlike t. brucei which possesses h/aga box
 <cit> , both p. falciparum and e. histolytica contain the highly conserved h/aca box. in contrast to p. falciparum and t. brucei where the number of methylation sites is much larger than psi sites, in e. histolytica we find an almost equal number of both kinds of modifications. there are  <dig> methylation sites and 41 psi sites. in overall sequence, e. histolytica snornas are much more homologous to yeast and human than to p. falciparum and t. brucei.

the greater sequence homology of e. histolytica snornas with yeast and human compared with the two parasite species, and the lack of any particular snorna features unique to all three parasite species shows that this highly conserved rna modification machinery is unlikely to be linked to pathogenesis and each parasite species has evolved its own distinct snorna features. this study will help to further understand the evolution of these conserved rnas in diverse phylogenetic groups and will be very useful in future studies on pre rrna processing in e. histolytica.
