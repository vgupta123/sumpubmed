BACKGROUND
circulating strains of influenza a virus  vary year-to-year in their genetic composition and potential pathogenicity. influenza associated deaths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  per year in the united states between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the impact of iav on the human population is influenced by the periodic occurrence of iav pandemics, such as the one in  <dig> that resulted in the deaths of more than  <dig>  people worldwide  <cit> . these pandemics are driven by the introduction of new iav strains for which there is no  pre-existing immunity. the  <dig> iav pandemic strain was a result of a previous triple reassortment of bird, swine and human flu viruses further combined with a eurasian pig flu virus. the ability to predict the immune responsiveness to such emerging strains would greatly improve our ability to respond appropriately to these threats.

the iav genome has evolved several mechanisms to antagonize host immune responses. ns <dig> and pb1-f <dig> are particularly important since they directly interact with and modulate cellular innate immune response . for example, ns <dig> binds and sequesters double-stranded rna  produced by the virus, thereby preventing activation of host pathogen-recognition receptors ; delaying the production of interferon beta . mutations in these immune antagonists have been associated with increased symptoms in circulating iav strains  <cit> . thus, understanding mechanisms of iav antagonism is critical to be able to predict pathogenicity.

genome-wide transcriptional profiling studies offer an unbiased approach to investigating host immune responses, and have identified several markers associated with severe iav infections . severe infections are generally characterized by an early, sustained and excessive inflammatory response . this inflammatory response is regulated by nfkb, hmga <dig> and nfatc <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . in contrast, asymptomatic infections are associated with the induction of negative regulators of inflammatory signals, especially nlrp <dig> and nod <dig>  <cit> . many transcription factors, including irf <dig>  stat <dig> and nfkb <dig>  are induced by all iav strains  <cit> . nevertheless, comparison across multiple iav strains has revealed strain-specific effects on the rate and magnitude of the innate immune responses  <cit> . many of these strain-specific effects are likely due to differences in virally-encoded immune antagonists. for example, the  <dig> pandemic strain lacks the ability to interact with the cellular pre-mrna processing protein cpsf <dig>  <cit>  and does not code for the virulence factor pb1-f <dig>  <cit> . moreover, deletion of ns <dig> increases the number and magnitude of expression of cellular genes implicated in the ifn, nf-κb, and other antiviral pathways  <cit> . however, reproducible signatures of iav antagonisms are yet to be revealed  <cit> . immune antagonism is frequently associated with the suppression of activity  protein of iav)  <cit> . thus, detecting such mechanisms depends on selecting a good control where the activity is present. one possibility is to compare the response to multiple strains, while an alternate strategy uses a virus that is non-pathogenic in humans, such as newcastle disease virus . ndv infection of humans provides an ideal system to define the uninhibited regulatory network  <cit> . ndv is an avian virus that is able to stimulate innate immunity similar to iav, but lacks the ability to evade the human immune response  <cit> . by comparing the activity of transcription factors between the iav and ndv responses, we can gain insights into the effects of viral antagonism leading to the suppression host immunity. while the differences in transcription factors activities between the iav and ndv responses could also be mediated by the involvement of yet unknown viral recognition pathways, the current state of knowledge indicates striking similarity in the anti-viral responses which are mainly mediated by the rig-i signaling pathway in both infections. moreover, at the same moi iav and ndv show similar infectivity in dcs  <cit> . identifying active pathways and transcription factors  <cit> , and then comparing these between multiple responses could be used to identify the effect of iav immune antagonism.

several computational methods have been proposed to detect transcription factor activity from genome-wide transcriptional profiling data  <cit> . these methods are based on the analysis of coordinated changes in the expression of transcription factor target genes. these include over-representation approach such as hypergeometric test, or aggregate score approach such as gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> . these methods can be used to identify transcription factors with significant activity in one response that is lacking in another response  <cit> . in addition to being sensitive to the cutoffs used for statistical analysis, this approach is subject to simpson’s paradox  <cit> . just because two responses behave differently from their respective controls does not imply that they are significantly different from each other. for example, just because a gene is significantly differentially-expressed following ndv infection , but not iav infection , does not necessarily mean the gene will be differentially expressed when comparing ndv and iav directly. furthermore, the p-values produced by such methods cannot be directly compared between two infections because lower p-values do not necessarily imply stronger activity. thus, more flexible methods are needed that allow for quantification of transcription factor and pathway activities and their direct comparison across studies.

we propose a new approach for bayesian estimation of transcription factor activity  that quantifies activity , and allows for direct comparison between multiple responses. applying beta to compare the transcription factor activity of human dendritic cells to infection with the new caledonia strain of iav with the non-pathogenic ndv response reveals several effects of iav-mediated antagonism on transcription factors, including a novel effect on satb <dig>  which we have validated experimentally.

RESULTS
beta enables comparative analysis across time-points and virus strains
to compare the iav and ndv responses, transcription factor activity  was defined independently for each infection response as the log-odds ratio between the observed frequency of tf targets among differentially-expressed genes  compared with the expected tf target frequency among a set of background genes : a≡log10π/1−ππ^/1−π^ 

thus, positive values of a indicate that tf targets are more frequent among differentially-expressed genes than expected , while negative values indicate they are less frequent . by analyzing the behavior of target genes, this approach does not require that the tf gene itself be differentially expressed. the use of log-odds ratio allows the activity  to be compared between iav and ndv responses, and more generally between experimental condition and time-points. in addition, the observed frequency of tf targets  and the activity a are characterized by a full probability density function  that is estimated using a bayesian approach as described in additional file 1: text s <dig> and  <cit> . the bayesian estimation of transcription factor activity  allows for activities to be compared across time-points, microarray platforms and experiments since it accounts for differences in both the number of differentially-expressed genes , as well as the background frequency of tf targets .

to confirm that the activity estimated by beta is robust to the number of differentially expressed genes, we quantified isgf <dig> activity in human dendritic cells stimulated with ifn-β. isgf <dig>  is activated by ifn-β and leads to the up-regulation of several hundred interferon stimulated genes   <cit> . ifn-β stimulations of dcs for  <dig>  h induce  <dig> genes. to quantify isgf <dig> activity when the number of de genes vary, different numbers of differentially expressed genes were sampled from these  <dig> and the set of tf targets was determined among them by computationally defining the genes having transfac binding site matrix for isgf <dig>  in the promoter region . while the p-values produced by the hypergeometric test decrease significantly as the number of differentially-expressed genes increases, beta activity remained constant . as a positive control, isgf <dig> activity was simulated as the increased expression of isgs  with  <dig> to 85 % of their pre-stimulation levels . fig. 1b shows that the activity estimated by beta significantly increases and the 95 % confidence intervals become tighter as isg expression levels increase. thus, beta activities are sensitive to underlying gene expression differences and can be used to compare experiments with differing numbers of differentially-expressed genes .fig.  <dig> beta is robust to the number of differentially-expressed genes, but sensitive to gene expression changes:  comparison of transcriptional profiles from dcs stimulated with interferon-β for  <dig>  h and unstimulated dcs identified  <dig> differentially-expressed genes. varying numbers of genes  were randomly sampled from this set. for each of these cases, isgf <dig> activity was measured by beta  and hypergeometric test p values   starting from the transcriptional profile of un-stimulated dcs, isgf <dig> activity was simulated by computationally increasing the expression levels of isgs, defined by schoggins et. al.  <cit> , from  <dig> to 85 % above their baseline values . isgf <dig> activity was then measured by beta  using a gene set based on the v$isre_ <dig> matrix from transfac. p-values isgf <dig> activity are  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e-13



transcription factors antagonized by iav during the early response 
to detect the effects of iav antagonism on host immunity, tf activities were compared between the responses to iav and ndv. since ndv infection activates innate viral sensing pathways, but does not encode any known human immune antagonists, any differences between these responses suggest modulation of the immune response by iav. as a first step, beta was used to define the set of tfs with significant activity in either infection . the statistical significance of the beta activity from zero was determined using equation  <dig> in  <cit> . tf target gene sets were created based on the presence of a transfac-defined binding site in the promoter region . when considering genes up-regulated during the first  <dig> hpi , significant beta activity was found for  <dig> tfs, with  <dig> of these tfs also differentially-expressed at the mrna level . however, many of the differentially expressed tfs were down-regulated with minimal changes over time, in contrast to the up-regulated tfs, which showed significant changes in their activities. strong activity was detected for many factors with well-characterized involvement in antiviral responses, including of isgf <dig>  nfkb <dig>  creb and stat-family tfs  <cit> . all of these factors displayed significant activity following both iav and ndv infections. in fact, when using beta activity and mrna differential-expression as criteria, no tfs were found to be specific for the iav or ndv responses. however, taking advantage of the ability to quantitatively compare beta activities across responses rather than simple presence/absence, several of these tfs were found to have significantly different levels of activity between the two infections . in each case, the absolute activity following iav infection was suppressed. seven tf target gene sets with positive activity in both responses had significantly lower activity following iav infection. all of these sets were defined by irf/isre binding sites, which have highly related motifs that are difficult to differentiate. the remaining seven tf target gene sets, including sox <dig> and nfe2l <dig> targets, had negative activity and were less suppressed following iav infection. negative beta activity could indicate that these tfs have repressive roles as a normal part of the immune response. however, none were found to have significant activity among down-regulated genes, and they were not investigated further. several of the active tfs predicted by beta were also identified using other existing methods , but a comparative analysis indicated that beta has better power . overall, these results suggest that the interferon response is a target of iav immune antagonism for the nc strain of iav, as has previously been shown for other strains  <cit> . this antagonism was strongest in the early phase of the response, but could be detected at later time-points as well .fig.  <dig> transcription factor activities following iav and ndv infections. the number of up-regulated genes was determined by comparing expression at each time-point post-infection with pre-infection levels . up-regulated tfs are indicated by the white portion of each bar. beta was then used to quantify tf activity  in ndv and iav infections based on gene sets defined by transfac matrices . coloring indicates weak  to strong  tf activity

interferon stimulated genes are specifically suppressed in iav-infected cells
significant isgf <dig> activity was observed during both iav and ndv responses . however, quantitative differences were apparent when comparing the strength of this activity between the two viruses. this raises an important question: if iav blocks the interferon response , why are so many isgs, such as mx <dig>  still differentially-expressed? to explain this observation, we hypothesized that iav was indeed blocking isg expression in infected cells, but that isgs were still being expressed in non-infected cells. since the dcs were infected with iav at an moi of  <dig>  it is expected that approximately 63 % of cells would not be infected. this hypothesis predicts that the lower isgf <dig> activity observed following iav infection results from significant heterogeneity in the underlying population being measured .

to better understand how the observed gene expression patterns could be affected by underlying population heterogeneity, we developed a dynamic model of isg induction. in this model, gene transcription increases as a function of the amount of interferon , and interferon levels are approximated by the observed expression of ifnb <dig> mrna . three extreme cases were considered:  a gene was expressed by both infected and non-infected cells,  a gene was expressed only by infected cells, and  a gene was expressed only by non-infected cells. in each of these cases, we simulated gene expression over 8 h and following infection with moi =  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  corresponding to  <dig>   <dig> and 86 % of cells being infected based on the poisson distribution, respectively. for genes that are expressed by all cells , the model predicts that the temporal expression profile will be independent of the moi. for genes that are expressed only by infected cells , the model predicts that increasing moi will lead to higher expression levels, but later induction times . finally, for genes that are expressed only by non-infected cells , the model predicts that increasing moi will lead to earlier and lower expression levels . the parameter estimation protocol  was evaluated by recalling the parameter values in the simulated data. we found that recall of all parameters was good as estimated by normalized root mean squared error   . thus, qualitatively different behaviors were predicted depending on which type of cells are expressing the gene.fig.  <dig> model-based analysis of genes at different multiplicities of infection . a an ode model  was used to predict the dynamics of genes expressed by infected cells  at different mois . the same model was then fit to experimentally measured ifna expression profiles  at different mois. best fit parameter values were . b an ode model  was used to predict the dynamics of genes expressed by non-infected cells  at different mois. the same model was then fit to experimentally measured mx <dig>  and ip <dig>  expression profiles. best fit parameter values for mx <dig> were k
i =  <dig> , n =  <dig> , d =  <dig>  and h =  <dig> , and for ip <dig> were k
i =  <dig> , n =  <dig> , d =  <dig>  and h =  <dig> . in all plots, lines indicate model results and triangles show experimentally measured values for moi =  <dig>  , moi =  <dig>  and moi =  <dig> 



to test the prediction that the isg expression observed following iav infection was predominantly coming from non-infected cells, dcs were infected with iav at three multiplicities of infections :  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  consistent with expectations based on the poisson distribution, the number of infected cells was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> % for mois of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. gene expression was measured for ifna and two isgs . the expression pattern of ifna served as a positive control, since it should be expressed only by infected cells. as predicted by the model , peak ifna levels were positively correlated with moi, but negatively correlated with the time of initial induction . in contrast, mx <dig> and ip <dig> expression decreased with increasing moi. this behavior is consistent with expression from non-infected cells  and indicates that infected cells contribute little, if anything, to the observed expression profiles. moreover, ip <dig> was expressed earlier at higher mois, suggesting that higher number of infected cells drive earlier expression of some isgs. this time of activation of ip <dig> was more sensitive to the number of infected cells than mx <dig>  such sensitivity to the number of infected cells could arise from differential bindingof irf <dig>  a hypothesis which is not further explored here. thus, isgs were expressed mainly by non-infected cells following iav infection, consistent with the hypothesis that iav antagonizes the type i interferon response specifically in infected cells.

satb <dig> is antagonized by iav
to identify additional effects of iav antagonism, beta was used to compare tf activities between iav and ndv infection during the later response . factors identified during this time period could be involved in dendritic cell maturation and interactions with t cells. this analysis identified  <dig> tfs, including foxo <dig> and nfat, as potential targets of iav antagonism . two of these tfs  also showed significantly lower mrna expression levels following iav infection compared with ndv infection . satb <dig> was particularly interesting because of its known involvement in t cell development . beta predicted that satb <dig> activity was significantly suppressed at 10 h post-infection with iav . this suppression impacted the maximum fold-changes achieved by virtually all satb <dig> target genes . to validate the prediction that iav infection antagonizes satb <dig> activity, chip-pcr was carried out to quantify satb <dig> binding at  <dig> and 10 h post-infection with iav or ndv. four satb <dig> targets were chosen based on the computationally-predicted presence of a satb <dig> binding site in the promoter region and significant differential-expression when comparing the ndv and iav responses. in all four cases, lower binding of satb <dig> was observed following iav infection compared to ndv infection . significant differences in satb <dig> nuclear translocation were also observed . interestingly, these measurements suggested higher levels of satb <dig> in the nucleus following iav infection. this could be a result of a feedback regulation mechanism induced by failure to induce satb <dig> target genes. taken together, these results suggest that iav inhibits satb <dig> activity, and that this inhibition is mediated through blocking of satb <dig> binding to the promoters of its target genes.fig.  <dig> mrna expression profiles for transcription factors modulated by iav at late time points . log <dig> fold changes across time  for transcription factors  with significantly different beta activities  in iav infection compared to ndv infection. coloring indicates small  to large  fold changes with respect to unstimulated expression levels

discussion
differences in genome-wide expression patterns are frequently used to compare virus-host interactions. comparisons across a range hosts have revealed immune pathways involved in the detection and destruction of viruses, while comparisons across viruses have elucidated a diverse array of mechanisms used by viruses to antagonize host immunity. mechanisms of viral antagonism include modulating antigen presentation, apoptosis of infected cells, cytokine-mediated signaling, and fc dependent immune activation  <cit> . influenza is a fast evolving virus, and has developed multiple ways of antagonizing anti-viral responses  <cit> . for example, iav virus protein pb1-f <dig> suppresses the activation of il- <dig> and il-1β through the modulation of nfkb  <cit> . the function of these antagonists can vary between iav strains, and impacts pathogenicity  <cit> . previous work has compared wild-type iav strains with genetically altered versions where potential antagonists, such as ns <dig>  are knocked out or genetically altered  <cit> . while such comparisons can identify mechanisms directly related to individual antagonists, they do not provide a global view of virus-host interaction and some mechanisms may be masked through redundancy. here, we propose to use ndv, a non-pathogenic virus, as a control to identify the genome-wide effects of iav immune antagonism. influenza and ndv are both negative sense rna myxoviruses and in birds, which are their natural hosts, their clinical symptoms are similar. ndv and iav both activate anti-viral responses mediated by rig-i and ips- <dig>  <cit> . however, ndv does not encode any known human immune antagonists, and thus can be used as a baseline to identify pathways and transcription factors whose activity is “missing” during iav infections.

viruses can modulate host responses through multiple mechanisms  <cit> . in order to gain mechanistic insight, we sought to use differential regulatory patterns of genome-wide expression profiles to identify candidate transcriptional activity differences. similar to many previous studies, transcription factor activity was assessed by analyzing the behavior of putative target genes  <cit> . existing methods, such as gsea  <cit>  are focused on detecting activity, and their main output consists of p-values indicating whether the factor is active. however, focusing on p-values limits the ability to carry out post-hoc comparative studies, since lower p-values do not necessarily imply higher activity. beta enables easy comparison across experiments and time-points by quantifying transcription factor activity rather than simply detecting it. hence, beta can detect quantitative differences in tf activity between ndv and iav responses. the estimation of full pdfs by beta has significant advantages over single p-values. p values reflect the certainty of differential-activity, not its strength, and are sensitive to both the number of differentially-expressed genes, as well as the overall number of genes measured. beta is robust to the number of differentially expressed genes in different experiments, while maintaining sensitivity to response-specific gene expression changes. beta also allows comparison between different platforms by using a normalization factor based on the marginal probability of the number of differentially expressed genes. other methods, such as qusage  <cit>  can also quantify gene set activity, but we found that beta has better power for detecting transcription factor activity . beta can also be used to quantify the activity of gene sets based on pathways or functional relationships, and details of comparison of beta with other methods have been provided in the additional file 1: text s <dig>  thus, beta should aid future studies seeking to identify differences between the responses to different iav strains , and can be employed with other gene set definitions .

genome-wide transcriptional profiles provide a global view of host responses. however, it is important to remember that such measurements are population averages, and can be greatly impacted by heterogeneity. although our experiments use a single cell type, virus infection itself produces two major subpopulations with unique responses. virally-infected cells  activate pathways associated with virus recognition and up-regulate interferon. interferon induces an anti-viral state in non-infected cells restricting spread of the virus and resulting in significant transcriptional changes in non-infected cells  <cit> . other cytokines such as tnf released by infected cells contribute to these transcriptional changes through paracrine signaling. infected cells can also respond to these cytokines, but their response may be modulated by viral antagonism. our results show how this population heterogeneity can potentially mask important effects. isg activity was detected following both infection with iav and ndv. from this simple observation, one might conclude that the iav strain of iav does not effectively antagonize the interferon response. however, comparison with the ndv response using beta revealed that the interferon response was significantly reduced following iav infection. using a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments at different mois, we demonstrated that the observed expression of isgs is mainly coming from non-infected cells. thus, the iav strain does effectively antagonize the interferon response, but specifically in infected cells. while future experiments might be designed to separately profile infected and non-infected cells, these can be difficult to recognize  <cit> .

the ability of beta to quantitatively compare gene set activities was critical for carrying out a comparative analysis of transcription factor activities following iav and ndv infection. this analysis revealed several effects of iav immune antagonism, including the previously identified transcription factor nfatc <dig>  which is associated with the inflammatory response during symptomatic iav infections  <cit> . additional effects predicted by beta should be followed-up with detailed mechanistic studies. for example, iav infection was predicted to suppress satb <dig> activity in dendritic cells. significantly, satb <dig> was recently shown to be induced downstream of irf <dig> in dcs  <cit> . here, we experimentally confirmed that iav infection modulates satb <dig> nuclear translocation and dna binding to target genes. the role of satb <dig> in thymocytes and th <dig> cells has been described, and it will be interesting to see if this factor has a similar function in dcs. depending on the adaptor with which satb <dig> co-operates it can have a role as an inducer or a suppressor of gene expression. for instance, satb <dig> induces c-maf  <cit> . during ndv infections of dendritic cells satb <dig> induces expression of its putative target genes, such as prdm <dig>  this expression is suppressed during iav infections; which is presumably due to reduced binding of satb <dig> as observed during chip-pcr experiments. interestingly, higher nuclear translocation of satb <dig> observed during iav infections suggests that iav inhibits binding of satb <dig> to the promoter. this is consistent with the role of satb <dig> as a molecular adaptor for several other proteins that work to pack dna into an inactive state. thus, by addressing the computational problem of comparative analysis of transcription factor activities, we identified novel effects of iav mediated antagonism.

similar to other enrichment methods, such as qusage  <cit>  and gsea  <cit> , beta is dependent on the quality of gene set definitions. frequently, a large overlap between gene-sets makes it difficult to identify the true causal pathway or tf. however, combining enrichment results with other relevant information, such as tf mrna levels, fold changes and location of the binding site , facilitate the selection of the most promising candidates for follow-up studies. gene-sets could also include false positives; this is especially likely for computationally identified tf targets, which are known to have low specificity. nevertheless, we find that beta performs well in practice compared to other over-representation analysis and functional scoring methods . the statistical model underlying beta is based on the binomial distribution, and thus assumes a fixed probability that each differentially expressed gene is a transcription factor target. for this reason, beta should not be used for small gene set sizes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a computational framework  that enables quantitative comparative analysis of transcription factor activities. the source code is freely available at clip.med.yale.edu/beta. this method will aid future studies to identify mechanistic differences in the host-pathogen interactions. application of beta to genome-wide transcriptional profiling data, from human dcs identified satb <dig> as a novel effect of iav antagonism.

to better understand how the observed gene expression patterns could be affected by underlying population heterogeneity, we developed a dynamic model of isg induction. the model describes expression kinetics of two genes, gi and gu, that are expressed by infected and non-infected cells respectively as:  <dig> dgidt=ki1‐e‐moibnbn+hn−digi   <dig> dgudt=kue‐moibnbn+hn−dugu 

where moi indicates the multiplicity of infection used for dendritic cell infections, ki and ku are the rates of expression of genes gi and gu, respectively, while di and du are the rates at which gene gi and gu are degraded, respectively. b is the level of interferon-β, whose values are interpolated from the normalized ifnb <dig> gene expression levels, and is used as a surrogate for virus detection by the cell and h is a hill constant describing concentration of b when the rate of gene induction is half of its maximum rate. .

numerical simulations and parameter estimation
numerical simulations and parameter estimation were performed in matlab r2010b. ode <dig> was used to numerically simulate the ordinary differential equation models with zero initial condition for eight hours. for comparison with the simulated expression levels, experimentally measured gene expression levels, including ifnb <dig>  were normalized by the maximum of the three averages calculated for each set of triplicate measurements at three multiplicities of infections. experimentally measured ifnb <dig> values were used as input to the simulation, and values at non-measured time-points were obtained using linear interpolation  of the average normalized ifnb <dig> levels at each moi.

parameter estimation was performed for each gene separately. all the parameters  for a given gene were estimated simultaneously by defining an objective function which minimizes the difference between simulated and experimentally-observed expression levels at three mois. both global and local search algorithms were used . the differential evolution algorithm  was run for  <dig> iterations and initial parameter values k =  <dig> - <dig> n =  <dig> - <dig> d = 0- <dig> h = 0- <dig>  <cit> . the resulting best estimates were then refined using a local search algorithm, non-linear least-squares , using the same objective function  <cit> . the quality of parameter estimates was assessed by simulating the data with a set of randomly chosen parameters and analyzing its recall.
