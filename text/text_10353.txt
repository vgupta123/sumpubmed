BACKGROUND
brucellosis is primarily a zoonotic disease, caused by members of the genus brucella, which currently constitutes several species based on pathogenicity, host preferences and phenotypic characteristics: b. abortus , b. canis , b. melitensis , b. suis , b. ovis , b. neotomae , b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis , and b. microti   <cit> . recently, a novel species, brucella inopinata, associated with a human infection has been recognized as the newest member of the genus brucella  <cit> . in early  <dig>  whole genome hybridization analysis studies revealed a high degree of genetic homology among the brucella species, which led to the proposal that the genus brucella was a mono-specific species with b. melitensis being the primary species and all others as sub-species and biovars  <cit> . however, due to the limited acceptability of the one-species concept, the traditional classification of brucella spp. based on phenotypic characteristics has been re-instated by the brucella taxonomy subcommittee in  <dig>  <cit> .

brucella are facultative intracellular pathogens that infect many organs and soft tissues, including mammary glands. infection frequently results in abortion, low milk production and fetal death in animals  <cit> . brucellosis in humans is mostly caused by b. abortus, b. melitensis, b. suis, and sometimes b. canis  <cit> , and is commonly associated with the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, meat from infected animals and exposure to infected animal tissues or laboratory transmission  <cit> . human brucellosis is a chronic debilitating infection with a very broad clinical picture potentially affecting any major organ, including the lung, causing varying respiratory symptoms  <cit> . respiratory infections in humans caused by brucella spp. is a rare manifestation with reports describing multifocal abscesses or nodules, hilar adenopathy and hemorrhagic pleural effusion with resolution by antimicrobial therapy and lung decortications  <cit> . most pulmonary brucellosis cases were found in farmers handling infected meat or travelers who consumed raw infected animal meat or unpasteurized milk products while visiting countries endemic for brucellosis  <cit> .

we report the isolation and identification of an unusual gram-negative, non-motile brucella-like coccoid bacillus  isolated from a lung biopsy in a 52-year-old male in australia with a history of chronic destructive pneumonia. the patient traveled worldwide but denied any common risk factors associated with brucellosis. both biochemical and molecular characteristics of the bo <dig> strain have demonstrated unique similarity with a recently described b. inopinata strain  associated with a breast implant wound of a 71-year-old patient from portland, oregon with clinical signs of brucellosis  <cit> .

RESULTS
phenotypic characterization
bo <dig> cells grown on sba or rba at 35-37°c with or without 5% co <dig> for  <dig> to  <dig> h were circular, convex, entire, smooth and opaque. the organisms were gram-negative, generally stained uniformly; and appeared coccoid to short coryneform rods. colonies of the bo <dig> strain ranged in size from punctuate to  <dig>  mm in diameter and they were non-motile, mucoid colonies on macconkey agar; positive for oxidase and catalase, exhibited nitrate reduction with production of gas and rapid urease production . hydrogen sulfide production by the bo <dig> strain was observed by the development of a dark gray color on lead acetate paper suspended above the heart infusion agar slant. subculture of individual colony types produced similar profiles and no hemolytic reaction was observed on sba plates after overnight incubation at 37°c. the bo <dig> cells grew in the presence of thionine  and basic fuchsin  dyes within  <dig> to  <dig> h. both the acriflavin and gel formation tests were negative. however, lysis by tbilisi phage specific for detection of brucella spp. in two routine test dilutions  appeared incomplete  <cit>  and agglutination of the bo <dig> cells with either monospecific anti-m or anti-a antisera were very weak.

antimicrobial susceptibility test
the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the bo <dig> strain was compared with a set of  <dig> other brucella spp. strains  along with bo1t based on clsi interpretive requirements for brucella spp.  <cit> . both strains had very similar mic patterns to all brucella reference strains tested previously  <cit>  . bo1t and bo <dig> strains grew well in cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth  after just  <dig> hours of incubation, unlike other brucella spp.  which do not routinely grow very well in camhb and require  <dig> hours of incubation in brucella broth for mic testing  <cit> . our standard phenotypic characterization, including the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, suggested that the bo <dig> strain more closely resembled the bo1t strain of the b. inopinata sp. than the other classical brucella spp.

a ninety-three brucella isolates  were tested  <cit> .

molecular characterization
detection of is <dig> element by pcr
the brucella specific insertion sequence  pcr was performed amplifying an 842-bp repetitive element using bo <dig> genomic dna. the is <dig> profile observed in strain bo <dig> was approximately the same size as that of the bo1t strain and the classical brucella spp. including b. ovis  . the bo <dig> strain also generated several large amplicons  similar to bo1t and other brucella strains with low intensity as reported earlier  <cit> .

real-time pcr for bo1t/bo2
a taqman pcr assay targeting conserved regions of the bo1t and brucella spp.16s rrna gene sequence was designed for rapid differentiation of potential b. inopinata-like strains from all other classical brucella and ochrobactrum spp. this real-time pcr assay, using two hybridization probes: bi-p specific for b. inopinata spp. and bru-p specific for brucella/ochrobactrum spp., gave average crossing threshold  values in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> . the bi-p probe demonstrated perfect agreement for both bo1t and bo <dig> strains as did the bru-p probe for all other brucella or ochrobactrum spp. respectively. both probes showed no cross reactivity against the other non-brucella strains tested to date  <cit>  demonstrating very high specificity of the target sequences in the pcr assay. both the bo1t/bo <dig> and the brucella/ochrobactrum specific probes were capable of optimal detection of template down to  <dig> fg/μl concentration of genomic dna template .

16s rrna gene sequence analysis
rapid identification of the bo <dig> strain as b. inopinata-like by the bo <dig> pcr assay led to sequence analysis of the full-length 16s rrna gene  of the bo <dig> strain. full sequence alignment with the 16s rrna gene sequences of bo1t, reference orchrobactrum spp. strains, and the brucella spp. consensus sequence confirmed that the bo <dig> strain shared 100% 16s rrna gene sequence identity to that of bo1t and  <dig> % identity with other brucella spp. .

omp2a/2b genes sequence analysis
we also analyzed two highly homologous outer membrane porin genes  of the bo <dig> and bo1tstrains and compared their full-length sequences with that of other brucella species available in genbank. the phylogenetic relationships derived by neighbor-joining clustering analysis of the bo <dig> omp2a  and omp2b  genes with the ncbi sequences of other brucella strains and the ochrobactrum anthropi lmg  <dig> reference strain demonstrated considerable intra- and inter-species variability . the bo <dig> omp2a and omp2b genes are  <dig> % homologous to each other. neighbor-joining clustering analysis of both omp2a and omp2b nucleotide sequences shows that bo <dig> clusters closest to bo1t and an atypical b. suis 83- <dig> strain  <cit> . the omp2a gene of bo <dig> is only  <dig> % divergent from that of bo1t. the omp2b gene is characteristically more diverse within the brucella spp. and is also evident with the bo <dig> omp2b gene which was  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical to the bo1t and b. suis 83- <dig> strains, respectively . clustering analysis demonstrates that bo1t, bo <dig> and the b. suis 83- <dig> strains form consistent sub-groups based on their omp2a and omp2b gene homology  <cit> .

reca gene sequence analysis
the reca gene  of strain bo <dig> was compared to those of bo1t, the classical brucella spp. and several representative ochrobactrum spp.  <cit> . within the genus brucella, the reca gene is highly conserved with 100% nucleotide sequence identity among the different species. interestingly, the bo <dig> reca nucleotide sequence reveals  <dig> % identity to the brucella consensus reca sequence due to  <dig> nucleotide substitutions. however, the bo <dig> reca gene has a lower identity  when compared to the bo1t reca sequence differing by  <dig> nucleotides. phylogenetic analysis of bo1t and bo <dig> strains with other brucella and ochrobactrum spp. shows that the brucella spp. clade including bo <dig> and bo1t, are distantly similar to the ochrobactrum spp. with approximately 85% sequence identity .

multiple locus sequence analysis
multiple locus sequence analysis  of nine brucella spp. house-keeping genes has been used to differentiate brucella spp. into distinct sequence types . bo1t was determined to be  <dig> % divergent from st <dig> and to possess novel alleles at all nine loci  <cit> . bo <dig> has shown similar divergence  from st <dig> by mlsa also with novel alleles in all nine loci. neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis clearly shows how divergent the bo1t and bo <dig> species are from the classical brucella sequence types . throughout the  <dig> -bp sequence examined, the bo1t and bo <dig> genomes have  <dig> common snps while there are  <dig> bo1t and  <dig> bo <dig> specific nucleotide changes that further characterize the divergence of these two strains at these highly conserved loci in the brucella genus.

multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analyses
both bo <dig> and bo1t strains were also investigated by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat  analysis  using fifteen vntr loci by capillary electrophoresis. results were compared with a panel of well-characterized brucella strains  representing known species from our collection  <cit> . our mlva- <dig> typing analysis of both bo <dig> and bo1t strains demonstrated unique vntr profiles in which both strains have six brucella-loci with the same alleles ; and seven loci with variable vntr amplicons . all vntrs successfully amplified in both bo <dig> and bo <dig> with the exception of vntr <dig> and - <dig> in bo1t. mlva- <dig> analysis revealed that both bo <dig> and bo1t had distinct vntr profiles in comparison to each other and other brucella strains .

discussion
in this paper we present the identification of an atypical brucella-like strain  isolated from the lung biopsy of a 52-year-old patient. as a young adult he lived in oregon on two occasions , and experienced an unexplained 'liver failure' and then severe pneumonia  from which he recovered with multiple courses of antimicrobial therapy as reported by the patient to his physicians in australia. this patient was originally misdiagnosed because of the misidentification of the bo <dig> strain as o. anthropi on an ap <dig> 20ne system. it is a common practice for clinical labs to attempt rapid identification of gram-negative coccobacillus organisms like brucella spp. from blood culture using automated systems. however, the brucella spp. are often misidentified due to their similar phenotypic characteristics to closely related organisms such as ochrobactrum spp.  <cit> . though the patient was initially treated for both ochrobactrum and brucella infections due to the difficulties in diagnosis, he recovered with an extended course of combination oral antimicrobial therapy.

this bo <dig> strain is phenotypically and molecularly similar to the recently identified b. inopinata type strain  recovered from a patient from oregon, which was also originally misidentified as o. anthropi by the api 20e and api 20ne  <cit> . both these strains share common colony morphology and biochemical characteristics including rapid urease and positive h2s production, inability or very weak agglutination with brucella specific antisera for the lipopolysaccharide-o-antigens or acriflavin. neither the bo1t or bo <dig> strains supports gel formation or exhibits growth inhibition to the dye media as shown by common members of the genus brucella. bo <dig> also exhibited incomplete lysis by tbilisi phage and had very similar antimicrobial susceptibility profiles to bo1t in comparison to other brucella reference strains.

insertion sequence  fingerprinting in the brucella species has shown that the genomic localization and copy number of the is <dig> insertion element  is species-specific and could have an association with specific pathogenicity for a preferred host  <cit> . the presence of multiple copies of bo1t-like is <dig> insertion sequences suggest not only that bo <dig> is a member of the brucella genus  but that the bo2-is <dig> amplification pattern specifically resembles that of the newly described b. inopinata species  <cit> . positive identification of the bo <dig> strain as a member of b. inopinata by our real-time bo <dig> pcr assay was significant. both bo1t and bo <dig> strains were the cause of distinct and unusual forms of human brucellosis. atypical clinical isolates of this nature can often be misdiagnosed by automated systems as was the case with bo1t and the bo <dig> strain described here  <cit> . the availability of the real-time taqman assay served as a reliable first-line tool for determining b. inopinata-like species.

these initial findings led to further characterization and sequence-based typing which provided additional supporting evidence that this new bo <dig> strain most resembles the b. inopinata sp. within the brucella genus. using broad-range eubacterial primers, gee et. al. effectively demonstrated the advantage of 16s rrna gene sequencing to identify brucella isolates reporting 100% identity in all the strains examined  <cit> . interestingly, the full-length 16s rrna gene sequence of bo <dig> was 100% identical to that of bo1t and  <dig> % identical to the brucella spp. consensus 16s rrna gene sequence. the high sequence identity of the bo <dig> 16s rrna sequence to the recently described b. inopinata sp. is remarkable and represents the first recognized brucella species to have a divergent 16s rrna sequence  <cit> .

the reca gene has been investigated as an alternative phylogenetic marker for several bacterial genera due to its highly conserved nature and ubiquity in prokaryotes  <cit> . unlike the high sequence homology of the reca gene within the brucella genus  <cit> , we identified unique variability in the reca gene sequences of bo <dig> and bo1t. sequence analysis revealed that the reca nucleotide sequence of the bo <dig> strain shared greater similarity with the brucella spp. reca consensus sequence than to bo1t. both bo <dig> and bo1t reca sequences are distanced by  <dig> and  <dig> unique snps, respectively, from the brucella spp. reca consensus sequence, and share only one common transversion at the  <dig> nucleotide position. translation of the reca gene sequences of bo1t, bo <dig> and the brucella spp. consensus sequence shows that all base pair changes were synonymous substitutions having no effect on protein structure or function. the brucella outer membrane proteins have been studied extensively for their function in virulence, pathogenicity, bacteriophage reception, antigenic factors and antibacterial evasion  <cit> . the genetic variability among the omp genes within the brucella spp. has proven effective at characterizing brucella spp. and strain types and is often used for higher resolution molecular typing  <cit> . the omp2a/2b genetic analysis we report here is very interesting in that bo <dig> consistently associates with not only bo1t but the atypical b. suis 83- <dig> strain that was isolated from a rodent in australia  <cit> ; and thus further investigation may be warranted into rodents as a possible natural reservoir for these novel brucella species.

investigation of the nine housekeeping genes by multi locus sequencing analysis demonstrates that bo <dig> is genetically distinct from bo1t yet exhibits remarkably similar divergence  from the classical brucella sequence types as shown in figure  <dig>  the relative similarity of the nucleotide sequences of bo1t and bo <dig> by mlsa demonstrates uniquely distant sequence types within the currently characterized brucella spp. and should be considered as a new group of sts within the brucella genus. they also exhibit distinct allelic profiles by mlva although all alleles in both the bo1t and bo <dig> allelic profiles have been observed in other brucella spp. furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis shown in figure  <dig> demonstrates that these strains form a single separate cluster from the classical brucella spp.  <cit> .

the molecular and microbiological characteristics presented here provide supporting evidence that strain bo <dig> is most closely associated with the bo1t strain and should be considered as a novel lineage of b. inopinata sp. attempting to understand the evolutionary origin of these two strains is somewhat confounded by the interesting and disparate medical histories of the case patients  from whom these strains were isolated and suggests that there are new and emerging brucella strains capable of causing unusual presentation of human brucellosis.

CONCLUSIONS
phenotypic and genomic analysis of the unusual brucella strain  from a lung biopsy have established it as a lineage of the recently identified novel b. inopinata sp. type strain bo1t, which was isolated from a wound associated with a breast implant. this is the first report of a human brucellosis case associated with chronic destructive pneumonia caused by an atypical brucella strain. an interesting finding from our molecular analysis reveals that both strains bo1t and bo <dig> appeared to be closely related to a less-characterized b. suis strain 83- <dig>  by their omp2a/2b genes, which may suggest a common ancestor and may also provide insight into the ecological niche, and host reservoir for these novel brucella strains causing unusual human infections.
