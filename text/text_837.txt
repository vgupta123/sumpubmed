BACKGROUND
the innate immune system recognizes conserved microbial products, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns , that are invariant among diverse groups of microorganisms. pamps are recognized by a set of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors  including toll-like receptors   <cit> . after the recognition of microbial pamps by innate immune systems, tlrs activate signaling pathways that induce inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides to eliminate invading pathogens. eleven members of the mammalian tlr family have been identified and cloned thus far. tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> have been studied in the greatest depth  <cit> , and tlr <dig> appears to be primarily involved in the recognition of lipopolysaccharide  from gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . in contrast, tlr <dig> responds to a variety of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial products, including peptidoglycan, lipoprotein, lipoteichoic acid, and lipoarabinomannan. this suggests that tlr <dig> plays a critical role in the host defence system  <cit> .

tlr <dig> is primarily expressed in monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes. there is also a growing body of evidence indicating that tlr <dig> is inducibly expressed in epithelial tissues. previous studies have shown that tlr <dig> is expressed at a low level in human epithelial cells under physiological conditions. however, tlr <dig> expression is greatly increased during bacterial infections through an nf-κb-dependent mechanism  <cit> . inducible expression of human tlr <dig> by the proinflammatory cytokine, tnfα, was also indicated in lung type ii-like a <dig> epithelial cells  <cit> . these findings indicate that increased tlr <dig> expression during bacterial infection may contribute in accelerating the immune response to invading pathogens.

although optimal tlr <dig> signaling is required to activate epithelial cells against microorganisms, excessive or inappropriate tlr <dig> expression and signaling could contribute to hyperresponsiveness against bacterial ligands, and enhance the inflammatory responses frequently detrimental to the host  <cit> . our previous studies indicate that expression of tlr <dig> is higher in the airway mucosae of chronic otitis media patients than in normal subjects  <cit> , and is also associated with inflammatory bowel disease  such as crohn's disease  <cit> . these reports implicate hyperresponsiveness to bacterial infection as a cause of the enhanced susceptibility to chronic inflammation. thus, regulation of tlr <dig> expression is likely an important immune-regulatory mechanism, commonly involved in host defence against bacterial infections.

the clinical course of cystic fibrosis , the most common lethal inherited disorder in caucasians, is characterized by two major respiratory symptoms, recurrent pulmonary infection and chronic inflammation that ultimately lead to death from respiratory failure  <cit> . two previous studies  <cit>  showed a modest up-regulation of tlr <dig> in cf airway epithelial cells that is consistent with an increased proinflammatory response to tlr2-activating bacterial ligands found in cf airways. in accordance with these findings, an increase in the expression of tlr <dig> gene in cf epithelial cells due to the hypomethylation of the tlr <dig> promoter has been demonstrated  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this hypomethylation-dependent activation of tlr <dig> transcription in human cf epithelial cells remain unknown.

the present study shows that a specific cpg region, adjacent to an sp <dig> binding site, are hypomethylated in cf epithelial cells. the minimal region required for maintenance of basal tlr <dig> promoter activity was comprised of the cpg site adjacent to an sp <dig> binding site. furthermore, sp1-dependent transcriptional activity, but not sp <dig> binding, was shown to be elevated in the hypomethylation-dependent enhancement of tlr <dig> gene expression in cf epithelial cells.

RESULTS
identification of cf-specific methylation patterns within the human tlr <dig> promoter
we recently showed that decreased methylation of human tlr <dig>  promoter is responsible for enhanced tlr <dig> expression in cf epithelial cells, and suggested that this increased tlr <dig> expression is responsible for augmenting the proinflammatory response to various bacterial products  <cit> . to identify specific promoter regions among the  <dig> potentially hypomethylated cpg sites in cf epithelial cells, the methylation profiles of these sites were characterized by bisulfite sequence analysis. the  <dig> cpg sites  were first bundled together into eight groups based on the relative proximity of each cpg . the methylation status of these eight cpg groupings was then analyzed in non-cf  and cf  epithelial cells. the proportion of methylated to unmethylated sites was assessed. statistical analysis using fischer's exact test compared non-cf/cf cells in the context of methylated/unmethylated cpgs in each site . this analysis identified cpg groupings #1– <dig> and #18– <dig> as significantly hypomethylated  and cpg groupings #6– <dig>  #13– <dig> and #16– <dig> as moderately hypomethylated . statistical analysis showed that the methylation of cpg groupings #4– <dig>  #9– <dig> and #11– <dig> were not significantly different  between non-cf and cf epithelial cells. these findings suggest that there are cf-specific methylation patterns  within the tlr <dig> promoter that may play a role in cf pathology.

acpg methylation was scored at specific sites  in the tlr <dig> promoter sequence from non-cf  and cf  epithelial cells. the number of methylated and unmethylated sites was scored and a fischer's exact test was used to assign p values .

identification of the minimal promoter region required for basal tlr <dig> promoter activity in human epithelial cells
assessment of a possible correlation between cfsmps within the tlr <dig> promoter and a minimal tlr <dig> promoter region required for basal tlr <dig> promoter activity was performed by deletion analysis of the tlr <dig> promoter. a series of reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the promoter region were constructed . these constructs were transfected into non-cf  and cf  epithelial cells. the cf cells express high levels of tlr <dig>  while the non-cf cells express low levels of tlr <dig> mrna . luciferase activity in all cell lines decreased as a function of promoter length  through pgl3-t2p ) , indicating that there are primary promoter regulatory elements between -120- to -12-bp upstream of the tlr <dig> gene coding sequences. we noted that the pattern of luciferase activity for the different constructs in the non-cf cells seemed to be similar to the pattern of activity measured in the cf epithelial cells even though the non-cf epithelial cells show very low levels of endogenous tlr <dig> mrna expression . statistical analysis showed that the differences between non-cf and cf epithelial cells in promoter activity of the reporter constructs were not significant  . this was not an unexpected result because the tlr <dig> promoter sequences in cf and non-cf cells are identical.

to further restrict a minimal region required for tlr <dig> basal promoter activity, we constructed pgl3-t2p  plasmid. this construct contains only one e <dig> transforming-specific  site and one sp <dig> binding site . the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with pgl3-t2p  was 3-fold higher than in those transfected with pgl3-t2p , indicating that the minimal promoter is located between -60-bp to -12-bp upstream of the transcription start site . it is important to note that this minimal region comprises cpg#18- <dig>  and is significantly hypomethylated in cf epithelial cells. these findings support the notion that this region regulates tlr <dig> expression.

sp <dig> binding site adjacent to cpg#18- <dig> in human epithelial cells
since cpg#18- <dig> is located adjacent to putative sp <dig> and ets binding sites , binding to these sites was assessed to determine whether they were required for minimal promoter activity. mutations were introduced into the sp <dig> and ets binding sites in the reporter plasmids. the introduction of a sp <dig> mutation into the pgl3-t2p  plasmid reduced the basal tlr <dig> promoter activity in both non-cf and cf epithelial cells , indicating that this sp <dig> binding site is involved in modulating tlr <dig> basal promoter activity. on the other hand, a mutation in the ets binding site in either the pgl3-t2p  or in the pgl3-t2p  construct did not affect tlr <dig> promoter activity .

regulation of tlr <dig> promoter activity and its gene expression by sp1
sp <dig> binding adjacent to cpg#18- <dig> appears to be critical for basal tlr <dig> transcription, so to test the extent to which sp <dig> regulates tlr <dig> transcription, cells were treated with mithramycin a , a known sp1-binding inhibitor  <cit> . treatment of hela cells with mita reduced basal tlr <dig> promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner  + pcdna <dig> ). furthermore, transfection of the cells with an sp <dig> expression vector caused a four-fold increase in basal tlr <dig> promoter activity that could be suppressed by mita  + sp1). hela cells transfected with a plasmid, pgl3p  spm that contained a mutant sp <dig> binding site showed a significant reduction in sp1-induced promoter activity . mita treatment of cfbe41o- cells suppressed the intrinsic tlr <dig> mrna expression in a dose-dependent manner . sp <dig> had no effect on the basal tlr <dig> promoter activity  + sp3). these results indicate that sp <dig>  but not sp <dig>  up-regulates tlr <dig> promoter activity and gene expression.

inhibition of basal and sp1-induced tlr <dig> promoter activity by in vitro dna methylation
the effect of in vitro dna methylation on the promoter activity of human tlr <dig> gene was investigated through transient transfection of hela cells with methylated cpg reporter constructs. endogenously activated luciferase activity was significantly reduced in the cells transfected with the methylated pgl3-t2p  construct and an empty expression vector  + pcdna <dig> ) . moreover, when cells were transfected with the methylated pgl3-t2p  and a vector expressing sp <dig>  tlr <dig> promoter activity was significantly inhibited  + sp1), indicating that sp1-mediated transcriptional activation was inhibited by promoter cpg methylation.

sp <dig> and tlr <dig> expression
16hbe14o- cells were treated with 5-azacytidine  and mita to assess if the endogenous methylation of dna affects sp1-induced tlr <dig> expression. treatment with 5-ac inhibited the methylation at cpg#18- <dig>  and significantly increased tlr <dig> expression in 16hbe14o- cells   <cit> . this 5-ac-induced expression of tlr <dig> mrna was inhibited by mita . cape, a known inhibitor for nf-κb  <cit> , had no effect on 5-ac-mediated expression. although 5-ac treatment significantly increased the levels of tlr <dig> mrna in 16hbe14o- cells, it did not affect endogenous sp <dig> expression . this indicates that 5-ac-induced up-regulation of tlr <dig> mrna in 16hbe14o- cells was due to the increase of sp1-dependent transcriptional activity, but independent of an increase in sp <dig> expression. consistent with this, notion is the observation that sp <dig> mrna expression , the nuclear expression of sp <dig> protein , and sp <dig> binding to a tlr <dig> promoter probe  were all similar in these cells.

methylation of cpg#18- <dig> and sp <dig> binding
the hypomethylation-dependent mechanisms underlying tlr <dig> transcription were analyzed by emsa using unmethylated and methylated probes. oligonucleotide probes methylated at one  or three  cpgs -monome and t2p-trime, respectively) were synthesized and subjected to emsa analysis. sp <dig> from 16hbe14o- cells binds to the unmethylated, mono-methylated and tri-methylated probes . sp1-specific binding was confirmed by the supershift assay using an anti-sp <dig> antibody . since the intensities of the bands from each reaction were identical, it appears that methylation at cpg#18- <dig> did not affect sp <dig> binding. similar emsa band patterns were also observed using nuclear extracts from cfbe41o- cells , suggesting that there is no difference in sp <dig> binding in non-cf and cf epithelial cells. these results indicate that mechanisms other than differential sp <dig> binding in non-cf and cf epithelial cells are responsible for the dna methylation-dependent regulation of tlr <dig> transcription in cf epithelial cells.

discussion
in mammalian cells, cpg methylation in a promoter is a primary epigenetic mechanism for silencing genes, and is involved in the control of cellular function and homeostasis. it is therefore reasonable to predict that aberrant methylation of cpg regions within a promoter could manifest in a pathology associated with some chronic diseases. recent studies have shown that tlr <dig> promoter hypomethylation is associated with increased expression of tlr <dig> in cf bronchial epithelial cells. this is consistent with cf airway pathology that typically shows increased proinflammatory responses to tlr <dig> bacterial ligands  <cit> . the present study shows that a specific cpg region of the tlr <dig> promoter, adjacent to an sp <dig> binding site, is significantly demethylated, and that this promoter region is both necessary and sufficient to maintain basal tlr <dig> promoter activity in human epithelial cells. these data suggest that there are cfsmps  within tlr <dig> promoter, that might be used as markers to facilitate the discovery of anti-inflammatory cf drugs, as has been the case with anti-tumor drug discovery  <cit> .

the studies presented here also sought to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying demethylation-dependent enhancement of tlr <dig> gene expression in cf epithelial cells. sp <dig>  but not sp <dig>  appears to play a critical role in maintaining basal tlr <dig> promoter activation in human epithelial cells. furthermore, sp <dig> appears to be involved in regulating dna demethylation-dependent tlr <dig> transcriptional activity and expression. it is important to note that the introduction of tri-methylation into the promoter region adjacent to sp <dig> binding site did not abrogate sp <dig> binding, and suggests that sp <dig> binding is not rate limiting in regulating tlr <dig> mrna expression. binding of some additional unknown "x" factors to the tri-methylated probe, regardless of the source of nuclear extract, was indicated in the emsa assay . this "x" factor band was not observed in the non- or mono-methylated probes , suggesting that the increased methylation of cpg#18- <dig> in non-cf epithelial cells enhances recruitment of factors that recognize tri-methylated cpgs and suppress sp1-dependent transcription without affecting the sp <dig> binding . on the other hand, the decreased methylation of cpg#18- <dig>  often observed in cf epithelial cells, might abolish the recruitment and activity of these "x" factors, and allowed sp1-dependent transcription of tlr <dig> .

the modulation of sp <dig> binding to its target sequences by dna methylation is controversial. in the promoters of p21cip <dig>  11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  <dig>  and gstp <dig> , sp <dig> binding was found to be diminished by dna methylation  <cit> . in contrast, sp <dig> binding to the claudin- <dig>  promoter was not influenced by dna methylation  <cit> . it was found that the methyl-cpg-binding domain protein  <dig>  was recruited to cpg sites and silenced the cldn <dig> gene in ovarian cancer cell lines without interfering with sp <dig> binding. the present study clearly indicates that sp <dig> binding to a tlr <dig> promoter region was not inhibited by dna methylation. this is similar to what was observed for the cldn <dig> promoter  <cit> . recruitment of methyl binding proteins to the sp <dig> binding site in the tlr <dig> promoter needs to be verified. mbd <dig> and/or the methyl-cpg-binding protein  <dig>  complex, a large protein complex that includes mbd <dig>  <cit> , could be candidate "x" factors that interact with the methylated tlr <dig> promoter.

it is still unclear how the methylation patterns of the tlr <dig> promoter are determined in non-cf and cf epithelial cell lines. whether it is recruitment of factors required for transcriptional activation or the recruitment of factors required for silencing requires further study. the a <dig> and hela, cell lines used as non-cf epithelial cells in this study, are not thought to express cftr mrna, yet their tlr <dig> expression was comparable to that of the 16hbe14o- cells. therefore, it appears that wt cftr expression may not be the only factor that would determine the tlr <dig> gene expression in epithelial cells. however, the processing of Δf508cftr might affect the transcription of the tlr <dig> gene through a mechanism that involves the methylation of dna and the expression of specific transcriptional regulatory factors. preliminary studies comparing cf and non-cf cells showed no difference in the expressions of dna methyl transferase genes, dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a, and dnmt3b  <cit> , or in the dna demethylases, mbd <dig> and gadd45a  <cit> , . one possible mechanism could involve the recruitment of factors that releases the methylation-induced transcription block by activating demethylation of the promoter in the nucleus. clearly, further investigation is required to elucidate these mechnaisms.

CONCLUSIONS
there appear to be cf-associated methylation patterns within the human tlr <dig>  promoter, that lead to increased expression of the tlr <dig> gene in cf epithelial cells. moreover, sp1-dependent transcription apppears to be an important component of the molecular mechanisms underlying cfsmps-related aberrant regulation of tlr <dig> expression in cf epithelial cells. increased responsiveness to tlr <dig> ligands as well as an increase in tlr <dig> expression in cf epithelial cells have been proposed as a contributing factor in cf-associated chronic inflammation. therefore, cf-specific methylation patterns within the tlr <dig> promoter may have important implications for the development of therapies directed at sites regulating tlr <dig> expression. furthermore, the studies presented here indicate that cf-specific hypomethylation of the htlr <dig> promoter may influence regulation of other inflammation-associated genes that are aberrantly regulated in cf epithelial cells  <cit> . further study of this system may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating inflammation in cf. this study underscores the role that epigenetic mechanisms like dna methylation play in the modulation of gene expression in response to cellular insult.
