BACKGROUND
protein kinases play critical key roles in cellular signal transduction and can be activated by either phosphorylation or interaction with other proteins or ligands  <cit> . however, surprisingly little is known about protein-protein interactions involved in kinase activation processes. scaffolds have been shown as allosteric regulators of kinases; symmetrical dimers of kinases could be involved in auto-phosphorylation regulation; and many protein kinases may be regulated via n-lobe interactions. in many protein kinases, activity is regulated by the coupling between the c-helix and regulatory domains  <cit> . in others, the catalytic domains act as their own regulatory regions  <cit> . recently, the map2k mek <dig> was demonstrated to be auto-regulated via the formation of a symmetrical dimer  <cit> .

janus kinase  <dig>  is a protein tyrosine kinase that transduces cellular signals through the jak-stat pathways  <cit> . deregulation of jak <dig> is thought to be associated with hematopoietic disorders and oncogenesis  <cit> , especially in patients with bcr-abl-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms   <cit> . however, the regulation mechanism of jak <dig> remains elusive. its kinase domain, jh <dig>  is likely negatively regulated  <cit>  by the adjacent pseudo-kinase domain, jh <dig>  probably in a manner similar to the mechanism of jak <dig> regulation  <cit> . although other kinase/pseudo-kinase systems have been reported recently  <cit> , the detailed interactions of jh1/jh <dig> are not well-understood, owing to a lack of available experimental structures. a theoretical structure model of the whole jak <dig> assembly has been built using homology modeling methods and co-evolution data  <cit> . in this model, the jh <dig> and jh <dig> domains face each other in an anti-symmetrical way; that is, the jh <dig> n-lobe contacts the jh <dig> c-lobe while the jh <dig> c-lobe contacts the jh <dig> n-lobe, with a helix-helix contact between the jh <dig> c-helix and the jh <dig> c-helix. this anti-symmetrical interface has not been reported in any other kinase/pseudo-kinase pair systems.

in  <dig>  studies identified the v617f mutation of the jak <dig> jh <dig> domain in large numbers of patients with diverse clonal myeloid disorders  <cit> . the surprising frequency of this mutation suggests that v <dig> may play important roles in the auto-regulation of jak <dig> and could become an important molecular target for new drug design. the v617f findings also imply that other mutations with similar phenotypes might have been ignored in the past; ma et al  <cit>  recent confirmed this idea through clinical evidence documenting mutations in exons  <dig> through  <dig> in patients with mpn-related phenotypes.

it has been suggested that the theoretical model outlined above may be able to explain the mutational effect of jak <dig> v617f at the atomic level  <cit> . starting from this theoretical model, a homology-based structure has been used to explain the mutational effect of an exon- <dig> mutant  <cit> . homology modelling technique has also been applied to predict the mutational effect of an exon  <dig> deletion  <cit> . although those models demonstrate the relative position of v <dig> to the jh1/jh <dig> domain, further atomic level details, not seen in those models, are desperately needed to explain the constitutive activation caused by v617f.

molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules have provided useful information complementary to experimental evidence  <cit> . we recently reported 60-ns molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and v617f mutant jak <dig> proteins, starting with the theoretical model mentioned above  <cit> . although the overall fold is maintained, the local conformations obtained from our simulations are significantly different from the starting theoretical homology model. more importantly, the simulation results now are able to explain the auto-regulation of jak <dig> and the constitutive activation due to v617f in detail. there are three key groups of interactions between the jh <dig> and jh <dig> domains, holding jh <dig> in a closed inactive conformation. in the v617f mutant, f <dig> interacts with f <dig> and blocks other key interactions, resulting in loss of the jh1/jh <dig> interactions and forcing jh <dig> back to it open, active conformation .

nevertheless, only the wild-type and one mutant  jak <dig> were simulated in our previous study, hence the prediction of the jh1/jh <dig> domain interactions is not yet conclusive. here we extend the simulations to newly discovered, clinically observed mutants, along with a set of presumably benign control mutants . our findings here unveil the jak <dig> auto-regulation mechanism in much greater detail, and simulation results provide a plausible explanation for the effects of each mutant at the atomic level. this study confirms the anti-symmetrical jh1/jh <dig> interface and, to our best knowledge, is the first to reconcile extensive clinically observed mutants through computational simulations of jak <dig>  these findings may provide the framework for rational drug design targeting various jak <dig> mutants.

RESULTS
jh1/jh <dig> interface and mutant selection
the jh1/jh <dig> interface derived from our previous simulation work is summarized in figure  <dig>  three key groups of interactions are shown: i- <dig> is the helix-helix interactions between the jh <dig> c-helix and the jh <dig> c-helix; i- <dig> is the interactions between the jh <dig> activation loop  and the jh <dig> c-helix; and i- <dig> is the interactions between the activation loop of jh <dig> and a region of contact in jh <dig>  including v <dig> 

ma et al  <cit>  recently reported detection of several mutations in exons  <dig> to  <dig>  based on analysis of approximately  <dig>  clinical blood samples. their findings suggested that molecular testing of jak <dig> mutations should not be restricted to the v617f and exon  <dig> mutations, but perhaps should extend to most of the jh <dig> pseudo-kinase domain. hence, the mutants used in our simulations were selected from the report of ma et al : k539l in exon 12; r564l, l579f, h587n, and s591l in exon 13; 14-del , h606q, v617i, v617f, and c618r in exon  <dig>  and l624p in exon  <dig>  all were detected in patients with mpn. in addition, control simulations were performed using the k603q/n667k double-mutant, v617c, and v617y. the double-mutant should be benign because q603/k <dig> is found in the jak <dig> of other mammals, including pig, chicken, mouse, and rat; only human and pony show the "un-mutated" sequences . v617c and v617y have never been reported in patients with mpn, despite the prevalence of v617f and experimental data demonstrating that v617c is benign  <cit> .

distortions of jh1/jh <dig> interactions due to various jak <dig> mutations
long time  full-scale molecular dynamics simulations were performed for each mutant, using simulation protocols described previously  <cit>  and in the methods section. the simulations performed here require at least  <dig> ns to reach steady-state, and the resulting mutational structure changes cannot be obtained by simple homology modelling methods  <cit> .

the use of various distances between jh <dig> and jh <dig> proved useful in characterizing the jh1/jh <dig> interface in our previous work  <cit> . however, the large number of distances needed to monitor the jh1/jh <dig> interface makes a succinct summary of the results difficult. hence, instead of inter-atomic distances, we used the torsion angle between the c-helices of jh <dig> and jh <dig> to monitor the i- <dig> group of interactions. figure  <dig> shows the relative torsion angle, defined as the dihedral angle between the carbonyl carbon atoms of residues r <dig>  e <dig>  s <dig>  and e <dig>  of all mutants from simulations,. i- <dig> interactions are severely changed in four mutants: k539l, s591l, v617i, and c618r. the data for 14-del is not shown since this mutant lacks the entire jh <dig> c-helix. i- <dig> interactions are more-or-less maintained in four mutants: l579f, k603n667k, v617c, and v617y.

for i- <dig> and i- <dig> the van der waals contact, a measure of inter-atomic interaction, was used to quantitatively analyze the interactions. the following van der waals contacts were measured:

• vdw: the van der waals contact between the jh <dig> activation-loop  and the jh <dig> c-helix . this term mainly measures the i- <dig> interactions.

• vdw: the van der waals contact between jh <dig> activation-loop and jh <dig> residues  <dig> to  <dig>  this term mainly measures the i- <dig> interactions.

• vdw: the summation of the above two terms, vdw and vdw . this term measures the total interactions of i- <dig> and i- <dig> 

van der waals contacts usually have negative values, indicating the molecular attracting force between atoms in molecules. a van der waals contact larger in magnitude  indicates that the two groups of measured atoms are closer; the van der waals contact will be near  <dig> when two groups of measured atoms are far away from each other. hence, the van der waals contacts in figure  <dig> can be thought of as the measure of the closeness between the jh <dig> activation loop and the jh <dig> domain . the total term, vdw, indicates how much the jh <dig> activation loop is "locked" by the jh <dig> domain. when the contact is strong, there is no space for atp or ligands to enter the active site and the jh <dig> kinase domain is thus locked and inactive. the results suggest that wild-type, k603q/n667k, v617c, and v617i jak <dig> have significantly larger contacts between the jh <dig> activation loop and the jh <dig> domain, while the k539l, r564l, s591l, 14-del, h606q, v617f, and c618r mutants have very small contacts.

summary of predicted effects of jak <dig> mutations on i- <dig>  i- <dig>  and i- <dig> interactions and total effects on the jh1/jh <dig> interface; and the comparison with experimental/clinical evidence. "o" indicates benign; "x", mildly deleterious; "xx", severely deleterious. the "jh1/jh <dig> openness" is defined as severely deleterious when i- <dig> or i- <dig> is severely deleterious.

origins of mutational effects
v617x mutants
v617c is very similar to wild-type and all three sets of interactions  are well preserved. v617c is thus a benign mutation, consistent with a recent experimental study  <cit> . however, close examination of the local conformation indicates that c <dig> binds to the jh <dig> activation loop in a slightly different way. in wt, v <dig> mainly contacts with hydrophobic residues v <dig>  l <dig>  and p <dig>  while in v617c, c <dig> slowly moves to form polar interactions with residues  <dig> to  <dig> after  <dig> ns. this implies that while v617c does not cause constitutive activation, it may induce different phosphorylation patterns at the jh <dig> activation loop.

v617i is similar to wild-type in that i- <dig> and i- <dig> are maintained; that is, the jh <dig> activation loop is locked by the jh <dig> c-helix and v <dig> region residues. however, the bulky side chain of i <dig> pushes the jh <dig> activation loop toward the i- <dig> interface  and breaks the i- <dig> interactions. this may imply that a mutation with a large non-polar side-chain will yield similar results.

in v617y , y <dig> also interacts with f <dig> and blocks the contacts between the jh <dig> activation loop and jh <dig> c-helix in a way very similar to v617f, in that the i- <dig> interactions  are severely damaged. however, while its aromatic ring interacts with f <dig>  the polar tail of y <dig> moves near the interface between the jh <dig> c-helix and the jh <dig> c-helix, forming multiple hydrogen-bonds with nearby water molecules and with the jh <dig> activation loop , indicated by the small decrease in the i- <dig> interactions . the result is that the jh1/jh <dig> interface is not as open as with f <dig>  based on the results of v617f and v617y, v617w would have mutational effects similar to those of v617f, since it will also interact with f <dig> and does not have a polar tail like v617y. this prediction is in fact consistent with recent observations  <cit> .

the simulation results of v <dig> mutants demonstrate the important roles that residue  <dig> side chain plays in jh1/jh <dig> interactions. an aromatic ring side chain  interacts with f <dig> to block the jh <dig> activation contact; a polar side chain  could change the local conformation and form a contact with k1005; and a large hydrophobic side chain  could interfere with the i- <dig> interactions.

s591
in our previous study, we predicted that a mutation of s <dig> would break the polar interaction between s <dig> and q <dig> and hence affect the i- <dig> interactions. s591l was indeed observed in mpn patients recently  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  s591l has the same conformation as wild-type jak <dig> at the very beginning of simulations . at  <dig> ns, the jh1/jh <dig> interface is well formed in wild-type jak2; in s591l jak <dig>  l <dig> forms hydrophobic contacts with nearby f <dig>  l <dig>  and a <dig>  the i- <dig> interface is totally distorted, and the i- <dig> and i- <dig> falls apart as well. the result suggests that s591l will be a severely deleterious mutation and will cause constitutive activation of jak <dig>  the mechanism may reflect the hydrophobic nature of the l <dig> residue in that its side chain is repelled by the jh1/jh <dig> interface region, which is highly solvent-accessible and is surrounded with many water molecules.

k539l, c618r, and r564l
in the simulation-derived structure , v <dig> is positioned to contact the jh <dig> activation loop, a result of the fold of the jh <dig> domain. a mutation altering the jh <dig> fold will likely affect the v <dig> position and hence the jh1/jh <dig> interface. v <dig> is located at the joint of the β- <dig> and β- <dig> sheets . these two beta sheets are connected through the hydrogen bonding network and anchored by surrounding residues. figure  <dig> shows parts of those surrounding residues. a loop from k <dig> to d <dig> forms few interactions with the β- <dig> sheet: d <dig> is in a highly charged environment formed by k <dig> and r <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  through some water bridges, point to the charged environment formed by r <dig>  e <dig>  and d <dig>  simulation results indicate that mutations of the relevant residues significantly disrupt the local conformation for the following reasons :

in k539l, l <dig> moves away from the highly-charged region of d <dig> and r <dig> and moves e <dig> and d <dig> downward.

in r564l, the strong salt bridge interactions between r <dig> and e543/d <dig> are completely lost.

in c618r, r <dig> moves toward e543/d <dig> and forms strong salt bridges with them, disrupting the interaction between r <dig> and e <dig> 

these conformational changes are consistent with the analysis of the jh1/jh <dig> interface . the results also suggest that the loop of residues  <dig> to  <dig> is important to support the local conformation near v <dig> 

l579f, l624p, and h606q
similarly, l <dig> is located in the β- <dig> sheet, l <dig> is located in a nearby beta-sheet, and h606q is in the loop connecting the jh <dig> c-helix and β- <dig> sheet . all three mutants cause conformational changes in this region. in l579f, f <dig> interacts with nearby f <dig>  changes the surrounding packing pattern, and causes the conformational changes between the β- <dig> and β- <dig> sheets. in l624p, p <dig> enforces a conformational change of the β- <dig> sheet because of the rigid conformation of proline. l579f and l624p cause local conformational changes but their mutational effects are relatively indirect and not as deleterious, consistent with the simulation results .

h606q disrupts the interactions between the residue  <dig> sidechain and the l604/l <dig> backbones, affecting the conformation of the loop  connecting the jh <dig> c-helix and the β- <dig> sheet and thus changing the position of v <dig> relative to the c-helix. this finding is consistent with the simulation results in that the i- <dig> and i- <dig> interactions are damaged severely  when the i- <dig> is moderately distorted . in this region, e <dig> and k <dig> form strong salt bridge interactions to maintain the local conformation. mutations of these two positions or nearby residues may also result in strong deleterious effects.

14-del
in this mutant the entire exon- <dig> coding region is deleted . almost every residue of the jh1/jh <dig> interface is missing, except s <dig> and e <dig>  simulation results  suggest that this mutant will very likely cause jak <dig> constitutive activation.

h587n and k603q/n667k double-mutant
because h <dig> is exposed to solvent and h587n would constitute a polar-to-polar conserved mutation, this variation might not be expected to cause a significant mutational effect. however, simulation results indicate that h587n modifies hydrogen bond pattern of the  <dig> residue. the sidechain of h <dig> normally forms hydrogen bonds with the backbones of y <dig> and s591; in the n <dig> variant, the s <dig> backbone forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone of n <dig> . the altered hydrogen bond pattern causes rotation of the jh <dig> c-helix and additional changes in the pattern of the hydrogen bond network between e <dig>  r <dig>  and n <dig>  in n <dig>  e <dig> now forms a new hydrogen bond with e <dig> and brings itself closer to the jh <dig> c-helix. the result is the disruption of the i- <dig> interactions, indicating that h587n is a deleterious mutation.

as mentioned above, the k603q/n667k double-mutant exists in the jak2s of other mammals, including pig, chicken, mouse, and rat; only human and pony sequences show the "un-mutated" sequences . not surprisingly, the simulation results suggest that k603/n <dig> will be a benign mutation . however, the detailed i- <dig> interaction patterns are significantly different from those of wild-type jak <dig> . wild-type has the following hydrogen bonding or salt bridge pairs: k603/e <dig>  e596/e <dig>  e596/r <dig>  e592/r <dig>  and r588/e <dig>  in k603q/n667k, there is no salt bridge between q <dig> and e <dig>  since q <dig> lacks a positive charge; q <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with s <dig> instead, causing significant rearrangements of the interactions. hydrogen bonding or salt bridge pairs in k603/qn667k jak <dig> include q603/s <dig>  e596/r <dig>  e896/r <dig>  e900/r <dig>  e592/r <dig>  and r588/e <dig>  the interactions in k603q/n667k jak <dig> seem stronger than in wild-type. indeed, the fluctuation  of the torsion angle between jh1/jh <dig> c-helices is much smaller in k603q/n667k than in wild-type . this finding suggests that k603q/n667k could have more stable i- <dig> interactions and may imply that mutational studies based on murine models could lead to different results, especially when considering the effect on the i- <dig> interactions. for example, h <dig> is no longer held by the side chains of y <dig> and s <dig> in k603q/n667k, which may imply that a mutation at the  <dig> position, such as h587n, would have different effect in the k603q/n667k mutant than in wild-type jak <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report a set of molecular dynamics simulations on clinically observed mutants along with control mutants. the results, which could not be obtained from simple homology-based models or other static structures, are consistent with available clinical and experimental evidence. although the jh1/jh <dig> interface is derived from simulations and should be considered as putative, the anti-symmetrical jh1/jh <dig> interface seems very reasonable and we are able to explain the mutational effect for each mutant at atomic levels, including the presumably benign mutants v617c and k603q/n667k. the results and analysis provide likely structural explanations of mutational mechanisms and may advance the understanding of jak <dig> auto-regulation. it is clear that our simulation-derived structures are capable of reproducing all available experimental/clinical mutational data. however, it is important to emphasize that such success does not prove that these structures are correct before experimental structures are available.

our simulation findings together with recent jak <dig> mutation profiling results  <cit>  suggest that molecular testing of jak <dig> mutations should not be restricted to v617f and exon  <dig> mutations  <cit> , but perhaps should extend to most of the pseudo-kinase domain coding region as well, especially the relevant residues shown in our atomic-level analysis.
