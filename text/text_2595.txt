BACKGROUND
the concept that genetic events cooperate to achieve malignant transformation was proposed over a decade ago. primary rodent cells are efficiently converted into tumorigenic cells by the co-expression of cooperating oncogenes. however, similar experiments with human cells have consistently failed  <cit> . in  <dig>  after more than  <dig> years of trying, researchers have managed to convert normal human cells into tumor cells by delivering telomerase catalytic subunit in combination with two oncogenes  <cit> . although malignant transformation of human cells by a single oncogene may not occur or may require specialized factors, we demonstrated that hccr- <dig>  associated with various types of human cancers, alone induced tumorigenic conversion of mouse cells  <cit> .

we have identified a novel oncogene, human cervical cancer oncogene , that was classified into  <dig> types: hccr- <dig>  and hccr- <dig>   <cit> . the hccr- <dig> and hccr- <dig> overexpressed cells were tumorigenic in nude mice and hccr transgenic mice developed breast cancers and metastasis  <cit> . also, hccr- <dig> was overexpressed in various types of human malignancies and was found to regulate the p <dig> tumor-suppressor gene negatively  <cit> . however, it is unknown how hccr- <dig> contributes to the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of human tumorigenesis.

cell transdifferentiation is characterized by loss of some phenotypesalong with acquisition of new phenotypes in differentiated cells. differentiated cells are endowed with the capacity of transforming into cells of a different type having other functions  <cit> . gene expression in differentiated cells has long been considered an irreversible phenomenon that is established at the time of replication. given that, although repressed, the same genetic framework is present in all cell types, a change in gene expression among differentiated cells was predictable in particular conditions.in fact, the differentiated state of a given cell is not irreversible.it depends on the up- and downregulation exerted by specificmolecules  <cit> .

recent research suggests that tumor formation may result from the development of cancer stem cells by the deregulation of normal self-renewal pathways of tissue stem cells. numerous signalling pathways have been implicated in this process including notch, wnt, lif , pten , shh  and bmi <dig>  <cit> . the discovery of cancer stem cells in aml, breast cancer and some cns tumors offers a new approach to understanding the biology of these conditions. further study into these and other mechanisms controlling self-renewal pathways is needed to understand not only what drives tumor formation from cancer stem cells but also what mechanisms could be used to 'switch off' tumor formation  <cit> .

we undertook this study with the following aims: 1) to assess whether hccr- <dig> overexpression converts normal cells to malignant transformed cells; 2) to determine whether hccr- <dig> is involved in transdifferentiation process and embryonic kidney development; 3) to examine the molecular alterations occurring in hccr- <dig> induced tumorigenesis.

RESULTS
hccr- <dig> is involved in tumorigenesis and transdifferentiation
we investigated whether hccr- <dig> alone can induce malignant transformation of hek- <dig> cells. transfection of hccr- <dig> expression vector into hek- <dig> cells yielded a transformation efficiency  of  <dig>  . the transformation efficiency of the wild-type ras gene used as a positive control was  <dig>   . these data suggest that hccr- <dig> has almost as potent oncogenic activity as wild-type ras in the hek- <dig> assay system. comparable transfection with the control vector alone  yielded no transformation . in total,  <dig> of the transformed foci were isolated from the hccr- <dig> transfected  <dig> cells and were grown in semisolid soft-agar medium to measure the colony formation efficiency. hccr-1-transfected  <dig> cells formed colonies with an efficiency of 13%.

*hek-293cells  were transfected with  <dig> μg of dna obtained from indicated source. the results reported here were derived from  <dig> independent experiments.

**transformed cell aggregates, foci, were counted by visual examination starting 2- <dig> weeks after transfection and the transformation efficiencies  were determined.

hek- <dig> is a short spindle shaped cell having a bipolar cell process . cultured  <dig> cells have similar cytological features to cells transfected with vector alone . however, hccr-1-transfected human  <dig> cells showed increase in cell size compared to wild-type human  <dig> cells . the cell processes were blunted in hccr-1-transfected human  <dig> cells. northern blot showed that about  <dig> -kilobase-pair mrna transcript was over-expressed in all five hccr-1-transfected human  <dig> cells as compared with wild-type  <dig> cells . nude mice injected with hccr-1-transfected human  <dig> cells showed palpable tumors in four weeks. but cells transfected with vector alone did not induce tumor formation in nude mice. sections of the nude mice tumor nodules bearing hccr-1-transfected human  <dig> cells revealed epithelial cell carcinomas . interestingly, however, the cells showed co-expression of epithelial markers, such as cytokeratin  <dig>  and cytokeratin  <dig> , and of the mesenchymal marker, vimentin that is normally expressed by fibroblasts . these results suggest that transdifferentiation  occurred in hccr- <dig> stably transfected  <dig> cells derived from nude mouse tumors.

in order to confirm the above data, we performed the immunofluorescence microscopy experiment in hek- <dig> and hek- <dig> stable clone for hccr- <dig> . the result showed that the parental hek- <dig> cells express the vimentin but in a lower level than hccr- <dig> stable hek- <dig> clone. this suggests that the vimentin level is slightly increased after hccr- <dig> transfection. we then analyzed other epithelial markers in hek- <dig>  hek- <dig> clones stably transfected with hccr- <dig>  and hek- <dig> cells transfected with the empty vector. e-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin are essential for the maintenance of epithelial structures. to determine whether the over-expression of hccr- <dig> alters the expression profiles of these molecules, we performed the western blotting analyses as follows . the result demonstrates that all of these epithelial markers  are down-regulated only in hccr- <dig> stable cell lines. therefore, this data support that hccr- <dig> induces emt in transformed hek- <dig> cells.

the oncogenic transformation of nih/3t <dig> cells would typically be expected to develop sarcomas because nih/3t <dig> cells are of mesenchymal origin  <cit> . however, the tumors in nude mice derived from hccr- <dig> stably transfected nih/3t <dig> cells had both sarcomatous  and epithelial features . histologically, the tumors showed poorly differentiated sarcoma with epithelial differentiation  . they were composed mostly of spindle cells forming long and short fasciles. in focal areas these cells were vaguely aggregated to form epithelial cell nest-like structures . reticulin fibers enveloped individual spindle cells in the sarcomatous areas, but enveloped vague epithelial cell nests in the more carcinomatous areas . for a morphologic comparison between hccr-1-derived tumor cells and epithelial cells, we determined whether hccr-1-derived tumor cells expressed epithelial cell markers, such as the epithelial membrane antigens , cytokeratin  <dig> , cytokeratin  <dig> , cytokeratin  <dig> , cytokeratin  <dig> , and the mesenchymal marker vimentin . hccr-1-derived tumor cells were positive for both epithelial and mesenchymal markers . these results suggest that transdifferentiation  occurred in hccr- <dig> stably transfected nih/3t <dig> cells derived from nude mice tumors. hccr- <dig> might play multiple developmental roles by mediating a signal originating from the mesenchyme and received by epithelia. mesenchymal signals are known to govern differentiation and morphogenesis of many epithelia, but the molecular nature of the signals is poorly understood. this expression pattern indicates that this mesenchymal factor can transmit morphogenetic signals in epithelia development and suggests a molecular mechanisim for mesenchymal epithelial interactions. this study indicates that the hccr- <dig> oncogene may be a mesenchyme-derived cytokine that stimulates the morphogenesis of epithelia and mediates interactions between the mesenchyme and epithelia during neoplasia.

induction of c-kit proto-oncogene product by hccr-1
cd <dig>  is a type iii receptor tyrosine kinase operating in cell signal transduction in several cell types. normally c-kit is activated  by binding of its ligand, the stem cell factor   <cit> . this leads to a phosphorylation cascade ultimately activating various transcription factors in different cell types. such activation regulates apoptosis, cell differentiation, proliferation, chemotaxis, and cell adhesion. ligand independent activation of c-kit  has been found to be an important component of oncogenesis in a large number of neoplastic disorders such as systemic mastocytosis, germ cell tumors, acute myelogenous leukemia  with the disruption of the core binding factor, amongst others  <cit> . c-kit positivity has been variably reported in sarcomas  <cit> . among mesenchymal tumors, c-kit seems to be specific for the gastrointestinal stromal tumors , which consistently express this protein. these tumors uniformly express cd <dig>  the c-kit proto-oncogene product  <cit> . signal transductions from tyrosine kinase receptors have key roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation  <cit>  and binding of scf to c-kit activates multiple signal transduction pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /akt  <cit> . because hccr- <dig> induced carcinosarcoma and hccr- <dig> is regulated by the pi3k/akt signaling pathway  <cit> , we investigated whether hccr-1-induced nude mice-derived carcinosarcoma induces the expression of cd <dig>  as does gist. hccr-1-derived tumor cells showed a positive staining for cd <dig> . western blot analysis also showed that nih/3t <dig> cells stably transfected with hccr- <dig> and nude mice-derived tumors injected with nih/3t <dig> cells transfected with hccr- <dig> both overexpressed the c-kit protein compared with nih/3t <dig> parental cells or cells transfected with vector alone . our study shows that hccr-1-derived tumor cells express cd <dig>  suggesting that hccr- <dig> is related to the c-kit signaling pathway.

embryonic kidney development
co-expression of the human met receptor, its ligand, and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor , in nih/3t <dig> fibroblasts causes cells to become tumorigenic in nude mice. the resultant tumors display lumen-like morphology, contain carcinoma-like focal areas with intercellular junctions resembling desmosomes, and co-express epithelial  and mesenchymal  cytoskeletal markers. the apparent met of the tumor cells mimics the conversion that occurs during embryonic kidney development, suggesting that met-hgf/sf signaling plays a role in this process as well as in tumors that express both epithelial and mesenchymal markers  <cit> . because acquisition of epithelial properties by the fibroblast-derived cells mimics the met of cells during the organogenesis of the kidney  <cit> , we investigated whether hccr- <dig> is expressed in the developing kidney. immunoblot analysis demonstrated that as probed by rabbit polyclonal anti-hccr- <dig> serum, hccr- <dig> began to be overexpressed at fetal 18-day, remaining high up to postnatal 14-day, and decreased to a very low level in adult rat kidney . sections of 20-day-old fetal rat kidney revealed that hccr- <dig> antibody stained throughout the collecting ducts only , which are derived from the ureteric bud  <cit> . the developing nephrons in the cortex were not stained . but the basolateral plasma membranes of the developing collecting duct, which are derived from the ureteric bud, were especially reactive to hccr- <dig> antibody . because nephrogenesis is stimulated by a distinct ureteric signal, diffusion-limited basolateral molecules  <cit> , which trigger met, we propose that the hccr- <dig> product may be a mesenchyme-derived regulatory factor  <cit> that stimulates morphogenesis of epithelia in the developmental process and mediates interactions between mesenchyme and epithelia during neoplastic transformation.

molecular genetic alterations in the hccr-1-induced tumorigenesis
in order to study whether there was an alteration in the growth properties of hccr-1-transfected cells, we examined cell cycle profiles. the percentage of wild-type nih/3t <dig> cells and hccr-1-transfected cells in the s-phase was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . these results suggest that there was a significant shift of the cell population out of the g 0/g 1-phase into the s-phase in hccr-1-transfected cells. to assess the serum-dependent cell cycle progression, cells were cultured in  <dig> % bovine calf serum  for  <dig> hours. after incubation, cells were released with 20% serum and harvested at the indicated times. in wild-type cells , few cells remained in the s-phase . in contrast, a considerable number of hccr-1-transfected cells were still in the s-phase , suggesting that constitutive overexpression of hccr- <dig> allowed for a relative amount of resistance to serum deprivation-induced g 0/g  <dig> arrest. following the release of cells from the growth arrest caused by serum-deprivation, there were consistent increases of over 10% in the s-phase populations of hccr-1-transfected cells as compared to wild-type cells at measured time intervals . therefore, overexpression of hccr- <dig> could deregulate cell growth by shortening the g 0/g 1-phase and increasing the s-phase population of cells. it has been implicated that egr- <dig> functions as a tumor-suppressor  <cit> . to assess whether hccr-1-induced tumor formation is associated with the loss of egr- <dig> expression, we tested the time course of egr- <dig> expression. when quiescent cells were stimulated with 20% serum, a marked down-regulation of egr- <dig> was observed in hccr-1-transfected cells compared with wild-type nih/3t <dig> cells . in contrast, upregulation of gapdh mrna level in hccr-1-transfected cells was clearly seen, while no significant difference was observed in the level of c-fos . this result suggests that down-regulation of tumor suppressor egr- <dig> may be involved in the tumor progression in hccr-1-overexpressing cells. to further explain the tumorigenesis of hccr- <dig>  we determined the telomerase activity in pkc-activated hccr-1-transfected cells. consistent with a previous study  <cit> ,wild-type nih/3t <dig> cells showed detectable telomerase activity . however, hccr- <dig> gene transfection increased telomerase activity up to about 7-fold when compared with wild-type cells. reports show that pkc induces a marked increase in telomerase activity  <cit> . to determine whether the increased telomerase activity in hccr- <dig> transfected cells is caused by pkc, a kinase assay was performed. pkc activity of hccr-1-transfected cells was increased by about 10-fold when compared with wild-type cells .

discussion
the conversion of normal cells into tumor cells involves changes in the activity of a number of distinct different genes and proteins in a cell. although researchers have been able to transform normal mouse cells into tumor-forming cells by introducing several cooperating oncogenes into these cells, human cells have been resistant to such transformation  <cit> . in this study, ectopic expression of hccr- <dig> alone results in direct tumorigenic conversion of hek- <dig> cells in vitro and in vivo.

because nih/3t <dig> cell is of mesenchymal origin  <cit> ,sarcoma would typically develop from oncogene-transformed nih/3t <dig>  <cit> . but, nude mice bearing hccr- <dig> allograft display characteristics of epithelial carcinomas. because acquisition of epithelial properties by the fibroblast-derived cells mimics the mesenchymal to epithelial conversion of cells during the organogenesis of the kidney  <cit> , we investigated whether hccr- <dig> is expressed in the developing kidney. the developing nephrons in the cortex were not stained. but the basolateral plasma membranes of the developing collecting duct, which are derived from the ureteric bud  <cit> ,were especially reactive to hccr- <dig> antibody. because nephrogenesis is stimulated by a distinct ureteric signal, diffusion-limited basolateral molecules  <cit> ,which trigger mesenchymal to epithelial conversion, we propose that the hccr- <dig> product may be a mesenchyme-derived regulatory factor  <cit> that stimulates morphogenesis of epithelia in the developmental process and mediates interactions between mesenchyme and epithelia during neoplastic transformation. our study suggests that overexpression of hccr- <dig> induces tumorigenesis, transdifferentiation and embryonic kidney development.

transdifferentiation is a change from one differentiated phenotype to another involving morphological and functional phenotypic markers  <cit> . the conversion of a cell phenotype is likely to be accomplished by selective enhancement of gene expression, which controls the terminal developmental commitment of cells  <cit> .there is little known about 'master switch' genes that determine a specific differentiation pathway and have the potential to induce the process in a cell originally destined for a different differentiation pathway  <cit> .hccr- <dig> might play multiple developmental roles by mediating a signal originating from the mesenchyme and received by epithelia. mesenchymal signals are known to govern differentiation and morphogenesis of many epithelia, but the molecular nature of the signals is poorly understood. this expression pattern indicates that this mesenchymal factor can transmit morphogenetic signals in epithelia development and suggests a molecular mechanisim for mesenchymal epithelial interactions.

there is evidence to indicate that tumors develop secondarily to abnormalities in pkc-mediated signal transduction  <cit> .reports show that pkc induces a marked increase in telomerase activity  <cit> .besides tumor cells typically have acquired damage to genes that directly regulate their cell cycles  <cit> . our study suggests that deregulation of hccr- <dig> activity in mouse nih/3t <dig> cells might result in the activation of pkc or telomerase, loss of particular cell cycle checkpoint controls, and downregulation of tumor suppressor egr- <dig>  thereby predisposing nih/3t <dig> cells to malignant conversion.

this present study suggests that hccr- <dig> is an oncogene which induces the transformation of hek <dig> and nih3t <dig> cells. likewise, our previous study also demonstrated that hccr- <dig> is a mitochondrial out membrane protein and suppresses the apoptosis  <cit> . consistent with this previous work, this study also reveals the anti-apoptotic activity of hccr- <dig> by reducing the expression of egr- <dig>  a direct regulator of multiple tumor suppressors including tgf beta <dig>  pten, and p <dig>  therefore, both studies support that hccr- <dig> is an oncogene either by suppressing apoptotic activities or by dysregulating egr- <dig>  telomerase, or pkc activity. since key functions related to apoptosis or anti-apoptosis often occur in mitochondria, it is not too surprising that hccr- <dig> localizes to the mitochondria.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we converted normal cells into tumor cells by delivering hccr- <dig> alone in combination with no other oncogenes. emt and met occurred in hccr-1-transfected tumor cells. in addition, hccr- <dig> participates in induction of the c-kit proto-oncogene, in activation of pkc and telomerase activities, and cell cycle progression. while further studies are needed to characterize cellular functions and regulatory mechanisms, hccr- <dig> protein is likely to be a candidate onco-developmental protein for cancer stem cell in the development of human cancer.
