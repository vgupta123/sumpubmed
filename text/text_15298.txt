BACKGROUND
corticotropin – releasing hormone  plays a major role in regulating the hypothalamic – pituitary – adrenal  axis, acute responses to stressors, and other neurological functions  <cit> . the cerebrospinal concentrations of crh  and neuropeptide y , another important neuropeptide involved in pain, autonomic and stress responses  <cit> , were measured in  <dig> normal humans to better understand these functions. subjects were studied as part of a large scale investigation of subjective and objective  responses to pain testing, exercise, and other stressors  <cit> . subjects completed questionnaires that assessed pain, anxiety, depression, coping skills, and other psychometric variables. normal control, fibromyalgia,  <cit> , chronic fatigue syndrome  <cit> , and veterans of the first persian gulf war  <cit>  were included. this pilot investigation focuses on the statistical strategy used to analyze the control population , and to develop methods for effective evaluation of patient populations. three multiple linear regression models  <cit>  were defined that predicted crhcsf based on  metabolic,  autonomic, and  psychometric measures.

RESULTS
demographics
the mean age for the group was  <dig>  yr  years. there were  <dig> females,  <dig> african-americans,  <dig> caucasians, and  <dig> caucasian hispanic . these subjects were a very normal and healthy group based upon their histories and the strict exclusion criteria.

npycsf
mean npycsf was  <dig>   pg/ml. npy did not correlate with any variable.

variables correlated with crhcsf
significant covariates of crhcsf could be grouped into: metabolic, autonomic function, and perceptional and cognitive functions . serum glucose was positively, and sodium negatively, correlated with crhcsf . explained variances  were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. glucose and sodium were also negatively correlated . resting norepinephrine levels at  <dig> time points and heart rate at  <dig> time points were colinear and positively correlated to crhcsf.

crhcsf was negatively correlated with the holter monitor-derived measure of log heart rate summed for the daytime, and the threshold temperature causing an initial, mild sensation of burning pain . the latter indicated that subjects with higher crhcsf perceived the burning pain of the cutaneous forearm hyperthermic stimulation at a lower threshold temperature than their peers. this may indicate an increased sensitivity to nociceptive stimuli. however, there was no correlation with deep pressure – induced pain. negative correlations were also found with the sf- <dig> vitality and ses manage symptoms domains. high scores were normal for these questionnaires, with lower scores indicating dysfunction.

effects in males
all parts of the study were completed by at least  <dig> males. analysis of the male subgroup gave some information about the role of gender. the pattern of significant covariables was different from the total group . respiratory rate was the only vital or physiological sign related to crhcsf. perceptions of vulnerability, physical functioning and self-efficacy were more highly related.

statistical models
sets of the significant metabolic, autonomic, and perceptual variables were grouped and analyzed by  <dig> linear regression models in order to detect significant relationships between independent variables and crhcsf. the  <dig> models had high significance levels . a metabolic model related crhcsf to glucose and sodium. an autonomic model linked crhcsf to resting respiratory and heart rates. the optimum perceptual model predicted crhcsf based on sf- <dig> vitality and mfi physical fatigue. the latter  <dig> domains were not the same as those in tables  <dig> and  <dig> because many of these variables were co-linear or surrogates of one another. this was reinforced by the similarity of r <dig> and p values where these domains were substituted for vitality and physical fatigue. these results were remarkable because it is very unusual for models with such small numbers of observations  to be so significant . the explained variances were very high  suggesting that the factors may be causally connected.

crhcsf did not correlate with variables associated with maximum exercise, heat – and pressure –  induced pain, or other rapid onset stressors .

discussion
despite the small numbers of normal subjects in this pilot investigation, the data, the explained variances for relationships, and final  <dig> models predictive of crhcsf were highly significant. the models were of importance, since they reflected the specific neurological functions of this neurohormone. crh and npy were co-expressed in the hypothalamus  <cit> , but npycsf did not correlate with crhcsf or any other variable.

crh and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis maintain numerous systemic functions. our metabolic model showed a tightly correlated relationship between  <dig> pm serum glucose, sodium and crhcsf. relatively higher crhcsf levels were associated with elevated serum glucose levels. when glucose is elevated, it is pumped into cells along with sodium ions  <cit> . in our model, this may have been reflected by the reduced serum sodium concentrations . these measurements were taken at different times, suggesting that the crhcsf set a long-term operating range for this system. the variables were interrelated. crhcsf in the low normal range was inferred from a low glucose and relatively high sodium. other reports also suggest a role of crh and energy balance  <cit> .

neuroendocrine responses such as these rely solely on crh type  <dig>  receptors and the hpa axis  <cit> . the other crh receptor gene, crh <dig>  has  <dig> splice variants  but only crh2α is expressed in the brain. crh <dig> and crh2α receptors have nonoverlapping distributions, but mediate many similar defensive behaviors suggesting that they act in parallel neural circuits. different stressors may act by separate circuits and have distinct feedback and control systems  <cit> . crh <dig> receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala may participate in conditioned fear responses  <cit> . these crh neurons may project to the hippocampus and crh <dig> receptors in the locus ceruleus to induce defensive behaviors and autonomic reflexes  <cit> . dorsal raphe nucleus neurons may release crh that acts on inhibitory crh2α receptors in the lateral septum  <cit> . neurons from the lateral septum tonically inhibit periaqueductal grey regions that induce similar defensive behaviors. these nuclei are probably additional sources of crh in the csf.

resting respiratory and pre-exercise heart rates and crhcsf were positively correlated. the statistical model indicated that a low crhcsf was predicted by low respiratory and heart rates. respiratory and cardiac functions are rigorously controlled by brainstem and other nuclei that integrate incoming signals of plasma o <dig>  co <dig> and h+ concentrations, activity needs, anxiety and other stressors. efferent cardiovascular and other autonomic reflexes are modulated by crh in man  <cit> . these central nervous system effects may be due to, or highly correlated with, crhcsf. this is supported by studies in mice that genetically overexpress crh. they develop chronic stress – like autonomic and physiological alterations  <cit> . stressors acting via conditioned fear responses may involve crh <dig> receptors in the central nucleus of the amygdala. some of these crh neurons project to locus ceruleus neurons  <cit>  that activate autonomic reflexes and defensive behaviors such as "freezing"  in rodents  <cit> . an example of this valuable defense would be the freezing of prey in the presence of a predator. immobility would allow the prey's camouflage to blend into the surroundings without generating motion – induced visual cues for the predator. in humans, excessive, aberrant or dysregulated manifestions of defense behaviors such as freezing may contribute to the immobility, inertia, or even catatonia that contribute to the clinical picture of depression  <cit> .

extrapolation of these concepts suggests that elevated crh may be related to anxiety, depression, or other disorders associated with chronic stress responses. if so, then lower, but normal, crhcsf should be present in persons lacking these stressor states. this was supported by the negative correlations of crhcsf with scores for the sf- <dig> vitality and change in health, self efficacy scale manage symptoms, miq vulnerability, and mfi physical functioning domains. each scale has an idealized "normal" end of the range of scores. deviation towards either higher  or lower  ends of the scales provides an estimate of dysfunction. for each of these domains, the lower crhcsf were associated with more normal scores, while higher crhcsf was associated with scores that were beginning to shift away from the normal pole of each scale. these trends were further supported by the statistical model where the optimum covariates of crhcsf were sf- <dig> vitality and mfi physical fatigue domains. the model predicted that crhcsf would be in the low normal range when vitality and physical fatigue domain scores were high . taken together, these results confirm the consistent physical status, mental coping skills, and general health of these subjects.

studies of intraventricular crh injection in primates support our findings  <cit> . the crh diffused to brain regions that led to  <dig> types of behavioral changes. externally oriented behaviors such as locomotion and environmental exploration were significantly decreased. anxiety – related self – clasping was increased. depression – like behaviors of avoidance of social contact, huddling, slouching, and wall facing were seen only in social settings. there were high interindividual differences in responses, but a key element was the social context in this study. this social context is lacking in rodent studies where animals are typically studied in isolation.

CONCLUSIONS
this small but intensively studied group of normal humans demonstrated surprisingly robust relationships between crhcsf and metabolic, autonomic, and psychometric measures. these are novel findings in humans, but are consistent with data on crh in acute and chronic stress models, and proposed crh neural circuits. it will now be of great interest to contrast these statistical models identified for normal subjects with the other chronic pain and fatigue patient subsets to determine if crhcsf correlates with different sets of variables.
