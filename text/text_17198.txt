BACKGROUND
hybrid zones, where lineages differentiable by one or more heritable traits meet and intercross, provide unique opportunities for studying the nature and dynamics of barriers to gene exchange. the evolution of these barriers can have many different outcomes, including divergence of populations leading to speciation, collapse of differentiated populations, hybrid speciation or invasion. the structure and evolution of hybrid zones depend mainly on the relative importance of dispersal, local adaptation and the fitness of hybrids  <cit> , influencing the strength of reproductive isolation. for example, with relatively high dispersal between adjacent populations, gene exchange between species is prevented only if local adaptation is sufficiently strong to eliminate hybrids. temporal isolation is a particular ecological isolation process that can result from divergent adaptations and cause assortative mating by itself. it involves differences in reproductive timing and can be the result of behavioral or developmental schedule divergences  <cit> . in this study we focus mainly on the role of dispersal and temporal assortative mating in shaping the mating patterns in a plant hybrid zone population, and on the relative male fitness of hybrids and parental species.

pollen dispersal is an important factor influencing the dynamics and evolution of plant populations . in particular, the frequency of long-distance dispersal events can have strong effects on the distribution of genetic diversity by connecting distant demes in metapopulations  <cit> : in contact zones, it may have important consequences because it can break down the genetic integrity of locally adapted populations and counter-balance the strength of selection. several processes can limit gene flow despite long-distance dispersal, and thereby increase the efficiency of response to selection. high selfing rates for example may preserve genetic integrity of well-adapted populations, but on the other hand they can also generate inbreeding depression and reduce the effect of selection  <cit> . in plants, temporal assortative mating is usually due to flowering time differences, which can also impede gene flow despite sympatry. if parental species are adapted to different habitats in parapatry, divergence in flowering time can be reinforced in the contact zone, thereby preventing gene flow and maladaptive hybridization. examples of this can be seen in natural populations of agrostis tenuis and anthoxanthum odoratum at mine boundaries  <cit>  and in a. odoratum growing under different treatments in the 150-year old park grass experiment  <cit> . in contrast, if divergent flowering times are selected in allopatry by different environmental factors, they may overlap in sympatry if intermediate ecotones exist  <cit>  or in the case of habitat disturbance . if hybrids do not suffer reduced fitness, the only way to maintain temporal isolation is a variation of selection regimes through the reproductive season  <cit> . indeed, as flowering times are often highly heritable, assortative mating due to flowering phenology can strongly influence the response to selection, for example it can increase the rate of response to directional selection  <cit> . moreover, in the case of strong temporal isolation, high selfing rates can provide reproductive insurance and thus contribute to maintain this isolation.

local scale studies involving cross-generational approaches with molecular markers are known to be useful for exploring the interactions between selection, assortative mating and dispersal in natural hybrid populations  <cit> . however, very few recent studies have used methods such as paternity or mating system analyses to estimate the importance of assortment and/or heterogeneity in mating success in structuring hybrid zones of plants  or animals . detecting temporal assortative mating, i.e. the correlation in flowering time between pollen donors and recipients, can be accomplished at a local scale by paternity analysis  <cit> . here we extend a recently developed mating model  <cit>  to estimate the level of temporal assortative mating, along with other important parameters involved in the evolution of a hybrid zone population between two closely related forest tree species.

the two european ash species fraxinus excelsior l. and f. angustifolia vahl have separate distributions in france but occur in sympatry in several contact zones where they hybridize  <cit> , although they show completely disjoint flowering phenologies in allopatry  <cit> . we previously showed that the extent of hybridization seems to be limited by climatic variations in some regions, but intermediate conditions provide ecotones where hybrids are widespread, such as in the loire valley in central france  <cit> . here we focus on one of the populations of this hybrid zone, in which we have shown that genetic and morphological differentiation of the adult trees correlates with differences in flowering times, producing isolation by time patterns  <cit> . individuals with extreme phenologies appear genetically and morphologically similar to one parental species, while intermediate flowering individuals cluster into several hybrid classes with flowering dates between those of the two species. moreover, we showed that these intermediate flowering hybrids produced more flowers and fruits over the two years of study. if these high levels of flowering and fruiting lead to a higher fitness, we may expect that these hybrid genotypes will rapidly invade the zone, especially if assortative mating occurs and/or selfing is frequent. the two parental species are known to be outcrossing species  but to date, there have been no study examining the level of selfing in hybrids.

in this paper, we use a modified version of the mixed-mating model  <cit>  to explore the relative importance of diverse forces influencing the evolution of this hybrid zone population by estimating jointly:  the pollen dispersal kernel and the rate of pollen immigration from outside the population,  the strength of spatial and temporal assortative mating,  the selfing rate within the population,  the relative male fitness through mating success of the parental species and different intermediate flowering hybrids and  the effect of different phenotypic trait variations on male fecundity , and  the effect of floral parasite infection intensity on the male fecundity. we also estimate the variation in selfing rates among phenological groups in order to assess the level of selfing in hybrids compared with the parental species. additionally, we study the impact of the genotyping error rate assumed in the method, as it can have a strong impact on the estimation of relative mating successes  <cit> .

RESULTS
joint estimation of the dispersal kernel, temporal assortative mating and male fecundities
dispersal kernel and immigration
the exponential power dispersal kernel provided here a better fit than the normal or the exponential kernel and than panmixia. note however that the fit of the exponential power was not significantly better than the exponential kernel assuming a genotyping error rate of 0% and  <dig> % . the estimated dispersal kernel was fat-tailed: the shape parameters  were lower than  <dig> . assuming genotyping error rate of  <dig> % or  <dig> % decreased the estimates of the scale parameter of the gaussian and exponential kernels leading to shorter dispersal distances. in contrast, high genotyping error led to fatter-tailed exponential power kernel  and also to a greater mean dispersal distance . the estimated immigration rates decreased when the rate of assumed genotyping errors increased , but was still ~60% for the highest assumed error rate.

selfing rate , immigration rate  and pollen dispersal parameters estimated under models  <dig> and  <dig>  and confidence intervals at 95% . the quality of fit was evaluated through the log-likelihood  of the data set under each model, and tested by a likelihood-ratio test  comparing fits under the nested model and the complete model  with exp. power kernel. k is the lrt statistics and d.f. the number of degrees of freedom. values of mean dispersal distance estimates  are expressed in meters

temporal assortative mating
the complete model  <dig>  which modelled relative flowering phenology, provided a significantly better fit than the model without any effect of relative phenology when accounting for genotyping error . the highest reproductive successes were observed when males flowered slightly earlier than the trees they fertilize  or when they belonged to the same phenological group . relative male fecundities decreased as the pollen-recipient trees flowered earlier than the pollen emitting trees. the fecundity on pollen-recipient trees that differed from  <dig> phenological groups  was estimated at  <dig>  accounting for possible genotyping errors did not substantially change the range of values of g^

assortative mating parameters relative to phenology  estimated under complete model  with exp. power kernel, and confidence intervals at 95% . indices for parameter estimates indicate the difference in number of phenological groups between the two parents . the effect of relative phenology was tested by removing it  and comparing to the complete model by a lrt.

male mating success of phenological groups
the complete model  <dig>  where the fertility of each phenological group was estimated over all pollen-recipient trees regardless of their flowering time, provided a significantly better fit than the model without any effect of phenology . the estimated male fecundity was significantly higher for phenological group  <dig> than for all other groups, and the estimated fecundity of the late flowering "f. excelsior" group  <dig> was zero when assuming no error . all other parameters  did not change compared to model  <dig> 

effect of phenotypic trait variations and gall attacks
flowering intensity and diameter at breast height  had a significant effect on the relative male fecundities, regardless of the assumed error rate : male fecundities were higher for trees with larger dbh and with larger flowering intensities. no other factor had a significant effect, except gall attacks for the assumed error rate of  <dig> % , while fruiting intensity had a marginally significant effect . the effect of the sexual type was never significant. the range of estimated relative fertilities did not change substantially when accounting for genotyping errors, except f^

fertility parameters relative to phenotypic traits and gall attacks  estimated under complete model  with exp. power kernel. the effect of each factor was tested by removing the factor and comparing to the complete model with all factors by a lrt. indices indicate different levels of each factor ,  <dig> = hermaphrodites with a high proportion of male flowers ,  <dig> = hermaphrodites with a low proportion of male flowers ,  <dig> = pure hermaphrodites .

male effective population density
with model  <dig>  we estimated from equation  the reduction of effective male population density  when only accounting for variation in phenotypic traits as  <dig>  when the assumed genotyping error rate was set at 0%,  <dig>  for a rate of  <dig> %, and  <dig>  for a rate of  <dig> %.

the mean reduction of effective male population density due to phenotypic traits and temporal assortative mating was estimated at  =  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . among pollen-recipients, regardless of genotyping error, the highest reductions were estimated from the pollen clouds of pollen-recipients belonging to the two latest phenological groups , and particularly that of group  <dig> .

finally, the mean reduction of effective male population density due to phenotypic traits, temporal assortative mating and non-random dispersal was estimated to  =  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  with an error rate of 0%,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.

selfing rates
the overall selfing rate estimated with model 1or  <dig> was 10% and was slightly affected by genotyping error . it varied among phenological groups  and among families, as estimated by mltr: the mean outcrossing rate  was significantly different from  <dig> within half of the families, with values ranging from 31% to 88% . the selfing rate was close to 20% in group  <dig> . in group  <dig>  the selfing rate was estimated at 7% : the family-level tm values were significantly different from  <dig> within 3/ <dig> families, ranging between  <dig> % and 94%. the selfing rate was estimated at zero in the two latest flowering groups .

discussion
methodological insights
according to araki and blouin  <cit> , assignment error can have a strong effect on the estimation of the relative reproductive successes of different groups, particularly by increasing type ii errors  when the proportion of unsampled parents is high. avoiding these errors is generally difficult  <cit> . here, we accounted for genotyping errors more realistically than previous methods  <cit> , where a mistyped allele can be of any size compared to the original allele. instead, we assumed that a genotyping error could be only of ±  <dig> repeat unit, which is more realistic for microsatellite loci.

as expected, some estimated parameter values varied with different assumed rates of error. however, the general trends remained quite similar: the estimates of dispersal parameters were relatively stable, and the ranking of relative phenology parameters, as well as fertility parameters of various phenotypic trait classes, were barely affected, except for sexual type. the main difference lay in the significance of effects, which was certainly due to the increased information provided by accounting for genotyping errors.

similarly, the value of the estimated rate of external pollen  when genotyping errors were assumed may be more reliable than without errors. the very high value  obtained when these errors were ignored illustrates a particular caveat of paternity analyses using microsatellite markers: higher allele numbers generally produce higher estimated immigration rates. indeed, using paternity exclusion methods, the apparent gene flow was estimated here between 45% and 55% with four loci, depending on the level of polymorphism of the selected loci, and increased up to 70% with six loci . increasing the level of polymorphism of the chosen loci improves the stringency of paternity analysis, by reducing the rate of multiple assignments and type ii errors. at the same time, however, more polymorphic loci increase the risk of overestimating external pollen flow by increasing the error rate.

homogenizing effect of long-distance pollen dispersal
we found a high level of pollen immigration, even when typing errors were accounted for . this has also been found in other anemophilous forest tree species such as pseudotsuga menziesii  <cit> , or quercus robur and q. petraea  <cit> . moreover, the best-fitting dispersal kernels were rather fat-tailed, which appears increasingly as a common feature in plants, including perennial herbs , crops  and forest trees . long-distance dispersal may tend to connect distant populations, homogenizing differentiated gene pools. here it is likely to have acted on the evolution of the hybrid zone of the two fraxinus species, by connecting remote populations, increasing local genetic diversity  <cit>  and possibly counteracting the effect of local adaptation if assortative mating is not strong enough. this long-distance dispersal has probably contributed to the creation and maintenance of a large-scale hybrid zone, as detected all along the loire valley  <cit> .

isolating role of assortative mating and selfing
spatial assortative mating
contrary to long-distance dispersal, short-distance dispersal may limit gene exchange at a local scale. the estimate of the shape parameter b of the exponential power kernel was not much smaller than  <dig>  and the estimated mean dispersal distance was quite low . these findings are consistent with a previous study we conducted in the same population showing that co-flowering trees were patchily distributed in space  <cit> . thus, even if long-distance dispersal takes place at a non-negligible rate, a substantial number of reproductive events inside the stand may occur within the patches. short-distance may produce pronounced spatial genetic structure, as previously detected in this population  <cit> .

temporal assortative mating
the homogenizing effect of long-distance dispersal may also be counteracted by temporal assortative mating. even with incomplete assortative mating, a large part of inside-stand reproductive events occurred within the same phenological group, which is strengthened by the high level of selfing. these patterns may contribute to maintain isolation by time patterns  <cit>  and potentially increase the rate of response to selection  <cit> .

one of our main results is that we detected no crosses between the parental species, as expected considering their phenologies. thus, intermediate flowering hybrids could represent bridges to gene flow in the contact zone, as described for example for asclepias species  <cit> . incidentally, the absence of mating events observed here between the two distinct species raises the question of how the first hybrids were produced. this could be due to exceptional events of hybridization between the two species, which occur at too low a rate to be detected in our study. for example, exceptionally hard winters, in which f. angustifolia individuals may have flowered much later than usual, as they require particular heat and chill conditions to flower  <cit> , could have favoured the first hybridization events.

selfing rates
high selfing rates may also contribute to counteract the homogenizing effect of long-distance dispersal, and thus help maintain temporal isolation and increase the success of well adapted genotypes if they do not suffer strong inbreeding depression. indeed, it has been shown that a mutant exhibiting high selfing rates can invade locally stable outcrossing populations despite strong inbreeding depression  <cit> . the relatively high rates of self-fertilization of hybrids may provide an advantage for them in colonizing the hybrid zone, as the parental species show very limited selfing: the estimated rates vary between  <dig> and 6% for f. excelsior  <cit> , and between  <dig> and 5% for f. angustifolia . given the low selfing rates of parental species, the occurrence of relatively high rates within intermediate flowering groups is surprising. the hypothesis of pollen limitation can be excluded for three reasons:  the number of individuals and the mean flowering intensities were higher in the groups where high selfing rates were detected  <cit> ,  the reduction in effective male population density due to fertility parameters and phenology was smaller in pollen clouds of mothers from group  <dig> and  <dig>  =  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively), and  mothers showing the highest selfing rates were not those that had the strongest reduction in their number of effective sires . a possible explanation for this increased selfing may be a breakdown of epistasis in intermediate flowering hybrids, caused by linkage disequilibrium between alleles at loci involved in self-rejection mechanisms that co-evolved independently within the two species.

male mating success of hybrids and parental species
the fertility of hybrids , and in particular individuals from group  <dig>  is higher than the fertility of either parental species . differences in some phenotypic traits may participate in this increased fertility.

we found in our previous study  <cit>  that intermediate flowering hybrids  produced more flowers and had a large dbh . here we show that larger tree diameters and higher flowering intensities increased male fertility , as expected for wind-pollinated species  <cit> , and also detected in other tree species . this may contribute to increase the fertility of group  <dig> 

mean values  of different phenotypic traits in the five phenological groups. the data were taken from gérard et al.  <cit> . morphology values are the mean coordinates for the first canonical variable from a canonical discriminant analysis. this analysis was performed on four morphological variables in populations of the two species and phenological groups .

surprisingly, we did not detect any effect of the sexual type on fertility, probably due to the similar values of siring success of different classes of hermaphrodites . thus male mating success did not depend on the relative proportions of staminate vs. perfect flowers. nevertheless, a higher male fertility of males relative to hermaphrodites was detected in controlled crosses  <cit>  and natural populations  <cit>  of f. excelsior. this was retrieved here by the very high relative male fecundity of pure males estimated with a typing error rate but it should be nuanced by the very low frequency of males in the population .

optimal sex allocation may also contribute to increase the male fertility of hybrids. indeed, trees producing many seeds also had the highest relative male fecundity. our results are consistent with classical predictions of sex allocation theory, i.e. a constant optimal sex allocation for simultaneous hermaphroditism, where individuals simultaneously produce male and female gametes  <cit> . nevertheless, many plant species seem to exhibit a gradual shift in sex allocation, and thereby in functional gender, with increasing size  <cit> . a positive correlation between male and female reproductive success has been detected in very few cases only  <cit> . here we present a case where individuals with a high male mating success also show a high female success. further long-term work is required to confirm that this observation remains true through time and for other hybrid populations.

the higher relative fertility of group  <dig> may be partly influenced by its lower mean level of gall attacks, compared with those of the other groups  <cit> . as gall mites  infect male ash flowers  <cit> , it is expected that high attack levels would influence the relative male fecundity. indeed, low levels of gall attacks seemed to have little effect but high rates strongly decreased relative fecundity.

asymmetry of pollen flow and evolution of the hybrid zone
flowering phenology also generates asymmetrical pollen flow: trees are quite successful in fertilizing the individuals with a flowering period that overlaps their own but starts later. in contrast, they show quite limited success on the individuals that flower earlier than they do, even if the flowering times overlap. this may result from the protogyny of the fraxinus species: early flowering trees may participate in reproduction mainly as pollen donors. mite attacks may also contribute to the observed asymmetry of gene flow by pollen since late flowering trees are more infected than early flowering trees  <cit> . they may also favour hybridization, by reducing the male fertility of late flowering trees. this asymmetry may provide a demographic advantage to early flowering hybrids because of the greater distances of pollen dispersal compared to seed dispersal in forest trees. on the other hand, although f. angustifolia individuals  had poor fertility during the year of study , they may benefit from favourable years and contribute significantly to young seedling generations . moreover, f. angustifolia shows reduced dormancy compared to f. excelsior  <cit> , possibly conferring another demographic advantage. thus, the invasive potential of f. angustifolia through hybridization in this region may be highly modified in the case of global warming.

further work, however, is still needed to assess the relative fitness of seeds produced by different types of individuals, either selfed or outcrossed. moreover, as pollen dispersal seems to occur over large distances, a larger sampling effort is perhaps needed to get more accurate estimates of the dynamics of the metapopulation in this hybrid zone. as the evolution of partially cross-fertile plant communities is greatly influenced by the strength of assortative mating and demographic characteristics  <cit> , theoretical work is also needed to better understand the interaction of short- and long-distance dispersal and assortative mating, as well as environmental fluctuations  in plant hybrid zones.

CONCLUSIONS
temporal and spatial assortative mating limit gene flow in this hybrid zone population, even if long-distance dispersal should tend to counter-act their effects. gene flow between parental species does not occur and intermediate flowering hybrids apparently represent bridges to gene flow between them. early flowering hybrids, which have the highest male mating success, show optimal sex allocation which, with increasing selfing rates, can potentially confer to them a selective advantage in the hybrid zone. moreover, temporal assortative mating could contribute to increasing the rate of response to selection by limiting gene flow between different classes of individuals.

the asymmetry of gene flow coming from early flowering pollen donors into late flowering recipients is probably a key factor involved in the dynamics and evolution of this hybrid population. if climate warming allows f. angustifolia not to suffer from winter frosts, the presence of hybrids could contribute to extending its range through this asymmetry. this study has strong implications for understanding the dynamics of forest hybrid zones and for the management of forest diversity in a climate change context.
