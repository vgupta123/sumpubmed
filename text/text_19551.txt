BACKGROUND
it has been estimated that there are over  <dig> million equids working in the developing world compared to  <dig>  million in developed countries  <cit> . these donkeys, mules and horses are used in mainly in agricultural communities for the essential work of field preparation, planting, harvesting and threshing. in addition, they are also used for market transport and the collection of wood and drinking water. in periurban and urban areas equids are used for transport of goods, people and refuse. with over  <dig> million of these animals in africa it is not unreasonable to estimate that over  <dig> million people on the continent are heavily dependent on the working equine for the economic viability of the family unit  <cit> .

it is evident from many studies that these working equids may harbour significant burdens of internal parasites  <cit> . such parasitic burdens may have significant consequences for the health of these animals  <cit> . in addition it has been suggested that affected animals may have a reduced work capacity  <cit> . organizations involved in their care invest significant sums in the administration of anthelmintics. for example, over 50% of the total number of case interventions in the period  <dig> to  <dig> by the society for the protection of animals and nature  morocco involved the administration of ivermectin or fenbendazole .

the current published research is divided over the actual benefits of such antehelmintic treatment programmes. some studies suggest that there was a positive impact  <cit> . others were less confident and were unable to identify any significant benefit  <cit> . the aim of this randomized triple-blind trial was to assess the efficacy of an anthelmintic treatment programme comparing treated and placebo control populations of working equids in field conditions in morocco. the principle objectives were to assess the impact of treatment on the animal body weight and condition score and owner perception using a questionnaire focusing on selected animal health criteria. faecal worm egg counts were also measured although evaluating drug efficacy through changes in faecal egg excretion was not a key objective. the study was conducted over a  <dig> month period during  <dig> and  <dig> 

RESULTS
initially,  <dig> animals were recruited into the study and were presented by their owners at time  <dig>  . of these,  <dig> completed the full study period. of these  <dig> animals had complete data sets,  <dig> in the treatment group a  and  <dig> in the control group b . data on animals initially enrolled in the study but failing to present for all treatments is shown in figure  <dig> 

in order to evaluate the efficacy of the randomisation process , variables measured at commencement of the study were compared between the treatment and control groups for animals which completed the study . these included age, species, sex, weight, body condition score and faecal worm egg count. no significant differences were observed in any measured variables with the exception of sex. the treatment group contained a greater proportion of males  than did the control group . the effect of unequal allocation to treatment group by sex was examined in further analyses and did not affect the results and, for simplicity, was not included in the analyses presented here.

anthelmintic treatment had a significant impact on faecal strongyle egg count. a significant interaction between treatment group and time was observed , with the effect of treatment group varying over time. the faecal strongyle egg count was significantly lower in the anthelmintic treatment group compared to the control group at times  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

there was no significant difference between the groups in observed weight between the first treatment and subsequent treatments . there was no evidence of an effect of treatment group on animal weight. however, in both the treatment and control groups body weight increased significantly during the trial.

despite the lack of evidence of an effect on body weight, anthelmintic treatment had a significant impact on body condition score. there was a significant interaction between treatment group and time  with body condition score being greater in the treated group at times  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  compared to the control group.

between t <dig> and t <dig> there was a significant difference in the responses of owners of the horses in the two treatment groups with respect to q <dig> , q <dig>  and q <dig>  . in each case, owners of animals in the treatment group were more likely than those in the control groups to respond in the more positive categories. this suggests that the treatment group was more likely to result in a perceived improved health, increased ability to work and reduced pruritus in the initial phase of the trial.

only the reported improved ability to work was still evident when comparing t <dig> and t  <dig> . there was no difference between the groups with regard to perceived health at this stage. interestingly, owners of horses in the treatment group were more likely to provide a more negative response with regard to pruritus at t <dig> compared to t <dig>  that is, whilst they often perceived pruritus to have improved between t <dig> and t <dig>  they were more likely to report a worsening at t <dig>  this effect arises because of those owners in the treatment group that report an improvement in pruritus between t <dig> and t <dig> , 81% reported a worsening by t <dig> . in contrast, of those owners in the control group reporting an improvement in pruritus between t <dig> and t <dig> , 55% reported a worsening by time  <dig> .

if owners responses to all questionnaire items were truly a reflection of their perception of change since the last observation time, these results also suggest that the perceived ability of the horse to work continued to improve between t <dig> and t <dig>  but that there was no additional improvement in perceived health over this same period.

comparison of responses for t <dig> and t <dig> did not identify significant effects for any of the questions. hence, by t <dig> owners in the treatment group were not more or less likely to report an improvement for any of the six health issues, compared to those in the control group.

discussion
a limited number of studies have been undertaken to assess the impact on health, performance or body weight of the use of anthelmintics in working equids. this study aimed to investigate these factors.

there was no significant difference between the two groups in body weight between the first and subsequent treatments. a small but significant weight gain was noted in both treatment and control groups over the twelve months of the study. the reasons for this are not known. one possible explanation is that the study started in early summer  <dig>  the cereal harvest that year was good with straw and grain  available at reasonable cost during the later part of the year . in addition the effect of being enrolled in a trial involving the accurate weighing of animals cannot be discounted. it may have encouraged owners to tend to the needs of their animals and offer them more feed than usual. this possibility that subjects improve that aspect of their behavior being experimentally measured simply in response to the fact that they are being studied has been reviewed  <cit> . the implication that animals enrolled in the study were adequately fed may influence the interpretation of other results. it has been suggested that in a stressed, undernourished equid internal parasites may have a relatively greater impact on health, the animal being less able to compensate for the parasitic challenge  <cit> .

despite the lack of evidence of an effect on body weight the treated group had a significantly greater recorded body condition score at t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> compared to the control group. the authors are unaware of any study that investigates variation in condition score over time in animals with consistent body mass in equids or other species. there are several potential explanations for this apparent effect on body condition. the observed effect may be due to treated animals appearing to be in better health, resulting in a perception of better body condition. in addition, there may be a redistribution of body tissue with treated animals carrying more muscle and fat in those specific body areas assessed in the judgement of condition score. alternatively, it may indicate that the "blinding" of the personnel assessing condition score was not effective and that they ascribed higher scores to those animals receiving the anthelmintic treatment. however no firm conclusions can be drawn and further investigation of this observation is warranted.

there was a significant reduction in faecal egg counts noted in the treated group at t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> when compared to the untreated group. this is not unexpected. small scale studies undertaken in morocco have demonstrated the efficacy of the products used and no evidence of resistance has been demonstrated .

over the course of the year 43% of animals originally enrolled did not complete the full study . there are a number of potential explanations. experience in morocco would strongly suggest that the use of animals for timely agricultural tasks or other profitable activity would take precedence over attending to animal health. in addition, animals are traded frequently during their working lives and may be retained only for seasonal activity .

the importance of helminth parasites and their potentially deleterious impact on working equid health is emphasised by a number of authors  <cit> . this potential problem has generally been addressed by the administration of anthelmintics  <cit> . there are important negative consequences if such treatments are used inappropriately. the potential for development of resistance and environmental concerns dictate that these products should be used correctly and effectively  <cit> . additionally, there are significant costs associated with the organisation and administration of treatments to large numbers of animals. it is incumbent on those responsible for such activities that they are undertaken based on objective evidence of their cost/benefit.

the faecal worm egg counts recorded amongst the untreated control animals are lower than those reported in other studies on working equids  <cit> . climatic conditions will influence the lifecycle and risk of grazing working equids acquiring helminth infection  <cit> . the current study took place during the period june  <dig> to july  <dig> a period of below average rainfall throughout the study area. this may explain the lower figures for mean faecal worm egg count compared to those of the previous study undertaken in morocco  <cit> . it is unlikely that anthelmintic treatment was purchased and administered by the owner or any other animal health practitioner .

the currently available literature relating to the potential benefits of anthelmintic use in working equids is limited and unclear. three studies report a measurable benefit from anthelmintic treatment using "body condition scoring" as the sole measure of assessment but have limited information on the methodologies and statistical analyses employed  <cit> . in a study that measured body weight, the use of a pre-winter treatment with moxidectin resulted in a 100% reduction in faecal egg counts, improved live weight and body condition score over  <dig> month period in donkeys kept at a research facility in south africa  <cit> .

three studies question the potential benefit of anthelmintic treatment. one study compared animals in moroccan markets visited by a mobile veterinary clinic which regularly administered anthelmintic treatments with animals in markets not visited  <cit> . there was no difference in condition score. there was however no record or specific evidence that the animals examined at the "previously treated" markets had in fact received any prior treatment. a further study on pregnant female donkeys and their offspring failed to show any improvement in live weight gain or foal survival when anthelmintic treatment or supplementary feeding was given alone. only when both were administered did live weight gain in adults and foals and foal survival improve significantly  <cit> . this study reported changes over a  <dig> month period. an unpublished study conducted in the north of ethiopia also questions the benefits of anthelmintic treatment. compared to controls the results suggest that donkeys treated quarterly with ivermectin failed to show any significant difference in body weight over a twelve month period. .

the questionnaire was a subjective assessment based on owner perception and memory. consequently the results and conclusions require future validation. however, decisions regarding therapy, including anthelminthic treatment, are made by owners and as such their perception of the impact of treatment may affect their decision-making.

cough and colic are common reasons for owners presenting animals at veterinary clinics in morocco and veterinary practitioners, suspecting parasites as factors in both syndromes, frequently prescribe or administer anthelmintics . there was no significant difference in the responses to the three questions relating to colic, coughing and diarrhoea and relatively few owners reported signs of "serious colic", frequent coughing, or episodes of diarrhoea.

the perception of a positive impact on "state of health", "ability to work" and "pruritus" is interesting and merits further investigation. although pruritus was frequently noted no formal attempt has yet been made to diagnose the aetiology of the common diseases in which pruritus is a noticeable sign within this population. personal observation and discussion with local practitioners would suggest that parasitic dermatoses and oxyuris equi may be implicated. these results suggest that anthelmintic treatment has a beneficial effect on pruritus, but that this is relatively short lived.

CONCLUSIONS
this study questions the suggestion that for working equids "the one common factor leading to ill health, suffering and early demise is parasitism"  <cit> . the results presented here suggest that while there may well be benefits that accrue from the use of anthelmintics these benefits may not be clear cut. furthermore, is perhaps advisable to recall that there may well be different species susceptibility between the horse, the mule and the donkey  <cit> . hence any similar intervention needs to be well adapted for the specific situation under consideration.

further research into the common problems affecting working equids in developing countries is required so that cost effective, appropriate, and sustainable strategies can be developed.
