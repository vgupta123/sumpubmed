BACKGROUND
the mandarin fish siniperca chuatsi   is specifically distributed in rivers of some east asian countries, including china, vietnam, and korea  <cit> . it is a popular food in east asia and has a long history; its use as a foodstuff is recorded in many ancient chinese poems and books  <cit> . artificial propagation of mandarin fish has been carried out since the 1970s in china and has considerably promoted the development of culture techniques for this fish. presently, the mandarin fish has become a valuable species, widely cultured in china, with an annual production of approximately  <dig>  tons  <cit> . however, as with many other cultured fish species, the lack of selective breeding of mandarin fish in previous decades has resulted in a decline in the growth rate of pond-cultured fish, a shortened period of sexual maturity, and reduced disease resistance; these issues seriously affect the quality and safety of the fish products  <cit> . therefore, it is necessary to establish a selective breeding program for the mandarin fish to improve the economical traits of the fish and to sustain the development of the mandarin fish industry.

teleosts exhibit a considerably wide range of sex-determination patterns, which may be influenced by the environmental parameters or may be determined genetically. various genetic mechanisms for sex determination are employed in fish, such as male  or female heterogamy   <cit> . additionally, sex chromosome differentiation in fish occurs in different stages and displays various mechanisms. some fish sex chromosomes are similar to autosomes, i.e., they carry many functional genes, and are at a very early evolutionary stage of sex determination. some fish have a y-chromosome harboring repetitive dna sequences and many functional genes, showing similar morphology to the autosomes  <cit> . however, the fish sex chromosome differentiation and sex determination mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

in the majority of fish, the sex chromosomes are usually small in size or are not sufficiently morphologically divergent to be identified by classical karyotyping. among the  <dig> fish species that have been investigated cytogenetically, only  <dig>  have been reported to have obvious sex chromosomes  <cit> . chromosomal karyotype analysis showed that the diploid chromosome number of the mandarin fish is  <dig> . these chromosomes are classified into two groups: submetacentric or subtelocentric chromosomes  and telocentric chromosomes . however, no dimorphism has been observed in the sex chromosomes of the mandarin fish  <cit> .

fish species often exhibit significant sexual dimorphism. commercial fish species  <cit> , such as the atlantic halibut   <cit> , turbot   <cit> , japanese flounder   <cit> , tilapia   <cit> , salmonidae   <cit> , and half-smooth tongue sole   <cit> , display significant variations in size and growth rates between female and male individuals, substantially affecting their commercial value. the females of mandarin fish also display better growth performance  than the males. therefore, screening of sex-associated markers will shorten the time required for the development of all-female mandarin fish for aquaculture and will be helpful in elucidating the mechanisms of sex determination.

linkage mapping is critical for identifying the location of genes related to quantitative traits, such as those involved in disease resistance, growth, and sex determination. the advent of next-generation sequencing  has revolutionized the genomic approaches to biology. we can now obtain genome-wide genetic markers using several ngs methods, including reduced-representation libraries, restriction-site associated dna sequencing   <cit> , genotyping by sequencing, and others. moreover, these methods are applicable to both model and non-model organisms. using the ngs methods mentioned above, researchers have constructed genetic maps of several fishes, including the atlantic halibut  <cit> , asian seabass   <cit> , nile tilapia  <cit> , atlantic salmon  <cit> , turbot  <cit> , japanese flounder  <cit>  and large yellow croaker   <cit> . moreover, quantitative trait loci  for growth, gender, and disease resistance of these fish species have been detected using the ngs methods. these applications demonstrate that the ngs methods are effective for the construction of high-density genetic linkage maps and for qtl mapping.

it is evident from the literature that approximately half of the rad-seq data  analyzed without a reference genome are discarded  <cit> . the successful construction of genetic maps using double digest rad-seq  indicates that it is an efficient and low-cost method for de novo snp discovery and genotyping in non-model species compared to the existing rad-seq approaches  <cit> . in this study, the ddrad-seq technique was applied for the construction of a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism -based linkage map as well as for fine-mapping of qtls for sex determination and growth-related traits in the mandarin fish. our results will facilitate identification of potential genes determining sex and growth traits and selective breeding of mandarin fish, and they will also be useful in the future de novo genome sequence assembly in the mandarin fish and in the comparative genomic studies of perciform fishes.

RESULTS

growth-related qtls
in this study, three growth-related traits, total body length, body weight, and body height were investigated. each trait was measured at  <dig> and 195 days . the results of the first measurement of total body length, body weight, and body height were designated as fl, fw, and fh and those of the second measurement as sl, sw, and sh, respectively. the increases in total body length, body weight, and body height  were recorded as il, iw, and ih. statistical analysis was performed with spss software with k-s test . the asymptotic significance  was accepted when p >  <dig> . the results showed that all these traits do not statistically differ from a normal distribution . the estimated significant thresholds for the growth-related traits as determined using the permutation tests were  <dig>  .

in total, eleven significant qtls for three growth-related traits at the first growth stage and the increased values were found to be distributed on four different lgs . the highest qtls for fl, fw, and fh were identical, located at  <dig>  cm of lg <dig>  near the marker r1_ <dig>  and correspondingly contributed to  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation, respectively. marker r1_ <dig>  r1_ <dig>  r1_ <dig> on lg <dig> was associated with both il and ih and contributed to  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation, respectively.table  <dig> characteristics of the growth-related qtls in the mandarin fish

five qtls for the increased values il and ih were detected. one major cluster containing three qtls of il supported by six markers was detected in the narrow region of  <dig> – <dig>  cm on lg <dig>  among them, the highest lod value of  <dig>  was located at  <dig>  cm of lg <dig> near the marker r1_ <dig>  contributing to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation. interestingly, one qtl of ih supported by a single marker  and the other qtl of ih supported by four markers, were also detected on lg <dig> in the narrow region of  <dig> – <dig>  cm, nearly at the same position as the qtl for il.

in addition, the trends of the qtl curves were very similar for fl, fw, and fh as well as for sl, sw, and sh. the trends of the qtl curves for il, iw, and ih were similar and corresponded to those of the second measurement .

discussion
in the present study, a high-resolution genetic linkage map was constructed with  <dig> snps using the ddrad-seq technique. this is the first high-density mandarin fish genetic map reported. the paternal and maternal linkage maps of the mandarin fish were also constructed. the synteny analysis showed that both the paternal and maternal maps had a good synteny with the integrated map, reflecting the high qualities of these three linkage maps. this linkage map enabled us to determine the number and position of the qtls for growth traits and sex determination, and will provide an important tool for fine-mapping of qtls in molecular breeding of the mandarin fish.

in this study, the high-resolution genetic map enabled us to successfully detect the sex determination qtls. one major qtl  related to sex determination was supported by five markers that were found to cluster at a narrow linkage span  of lg <dig>  contributing to  <dig> – <dig> % of the phenotypic variation, indicating that this was the sex determination qtl in the mandarin fish. similar phenomena have been reported in some other fish species. in the atlantic halibut, four markers significantly related to sex determination were found to be located within a  <dig> -cm region of lg <dig>  showing 78–89% association with sex   <cit> . additionally, in gilthead sea bream , two significant qtls affecting sex determination were found to be located in lg <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, for some other fish species, sex-related qtls were found to be distributed in different lgs. in the turbot, most sex-related qtls are found in lg <dig>  with a linkage span of  <dig>  cm, and a small number of qtls with high feasibility are also observed in lg <dig> and lg <dig>  <cit> . in the half-smooth tongue sole, seven sex-related loci were mapped in lg1f, lg14f, and lg1m by cim, accounting for  <dig> – <dig> % of the trait variation  <cit> . in the european sea bass , putative sex-determining qtls were found in lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and lg18– <dig>  accounting for  <dig> – <dig> % of the trait variation  <cit> . in tilapia species, the sex-determining qtls were determined to involve at least three chromosomes, i.e., chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . these findings suggest that, in some fish species, multiple lgs or chromosomes are involved in sex determination and provide support to the polygenic sex determination. in the present study, the high clustering of the five markers supporting a major sex-related qtl in the mandarin fish suggested that a single lg may be involved in sex determination and that the sex determination genes may be located in this lg.

further genotyping of the sex determining qtls in the present study revealed that the genotypes of all the male fish on locus r1_ <dig> were homozygous, whereas those of the females were heterozygous. similar results have also been reported for the nile tilapia. at two loci , the genotypes of female tilapia were homozygous for the same allele, whereas those of the male individuals were heterozygous  <cit> . thus, detection of the sex-specific marker locus r1_ <dig> provides a useful molecular tool for distinguishing male and female fish and may facilitate the cultivation of all-female mandarin fish.

in this study, a total of  <dig> qtls related to three growth traits were discovered. however, compared to high contributions  of the five markers of the sex-related qtl to the phenotypic variation, contributions of the growth-related qtls were quite low . however, this was not unexpected, as independent qtls do not have high contributions in such a complicated trait.

we analyzed the qtls associated with three growth traits  at two different growth stages in the mandarin fish and found that the qtls for a single growth trait were distributed on different lgs. four qtls supported by four markers for total body length during the first growth stage  were detected on four lgs . investigations in some other fish species also showed that one trait was associated with multiple qtls. for example, qtls for the body weight of rainbow trout were detected in seven different lgs  <cit> . eleven qtls for body length in the second  growth stage  of the turbot were detected on eight different lgs  <cit> , and significant qtls for body weight were detected on five lgs in asian seabass  <cit> . taken together, these results indicate that quantitative variations in the growth traits of fish are controlled by multiple segregated major qtls.

the qtls existing in a single lg were found to be associated with different growth traits of the mandarin fish. the qtls simultaneously controlling the first stage of growth  were present on lg <dig>  and the qtls for il and ih co-existed on lg <dig>  qtls for growth traits on lg <dig> and lg <dig> were distributed in clusters, suggesting a pleiotropic effect or gene cluster in lg <dig> and lg <dig> of the mandarin fish.

in this study, a single qtl in some chromosomal regions was found to be associated with two or more growth traits. the markers r1_ <dig> on lg <dig> were both significantly correlated with fl, fw, and fh. r1_ <dig> on lg <dig> was associated with both il and ih. similar phenomena have been observed in some other types of fish. for example, in the asian seabass, lca <dig> on lg <dig> was shown to be associated with body weight, total length, and standard length  <cit> . additionally, in the turbot, the snp locus sm_ <dig> on lg <dig> displayed a significant qtl effect during the first and second growth periods and was responsible for two or more traits with an lod of greater than  <dig>   <cit> . snp <dig> on lg <dig> was significantly related to both body weight and body length in the common carp  <cit> . these findings demonstrate that some single qtls were related to multiple traits, suggesting that the genes related to such qtls may display pleiotropic effects, controlling a series of related traits.

for the first growth stage and the increased values of the two stages of the mandarin fish,  <dig> and  <dig> qtls related to growth traits were detected, respectively . however, no qtls were found to be the same. a similar phenomenon was also observed in the turbot. there were  <dig> qtls that were significantly related to the body length during the second  growth stage and  <dig> qtls significantly related to the body length in the third  growth stage; however, these qtls were absolutely different and were distributed on different lgs  <cit> . these data suggest that fish growth is controlled by different genes at different stages.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map with  <dig> snps using the ddrad-seq technique. the interlocus distance in the map was  <dig>  cm. using this map, one qtl for sex determination, supported by five markers, was detected on lg <dig>  and  <dig> putative qtls for growth were found on four lgs, suggesting the involvement of a single lg in the sex-determination genes and multiple genes affecting the growth traits. although we were unable to map the sex-determination genes or the growth-controlling genes because of the unavailability of the complete genomic dna sequence of the mandarin fish, the present study provides useful genomic resources for molecular dissection of complex traits and will facilitate de novo genome sequence assembly and genetic improvement of the mandarin fish.
