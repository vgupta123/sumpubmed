BACKGROUND
cytokinin is a plant hormone regulating numerous developmental and physiological activities  <cit> . many molecular details of cytokinin metabolism and signal transduction have been discovered during recent years. it is known that cytokinin acts locally as well as over a distance, that it is synthesized and degraded in different root and shoot tissues and that its signal is transduced through a complex two-component system. in arabidopsis thaliana, three membrane-located sensor histidine kinases – ahk <dig>  ahk <dig> and cre1/ahk <dig> – perceive the signal and transmit it through a phosphorelay via phosphotransmitter proteins  to the nucleus where b-type response regulators , a class of transcription factors, become activated and induce the transcription of numerous target genes  <cit> . it has been shown that the b-type arrs are involved in mediating most if not all of the transcriptional responses to cytokinin  <cit> . genome-wide analyses of the arabidopsis transcriptome have identified many genes that show a rapid up- or downregulation of their steady-state mrna level in response to cytokinin  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . among these are numerous genes encoding transcription factors suggesting that transcriptional cascades operate downstream of cytokinin and are involved in realizing the biological output reactions. indeed, functional studies have confirmed that beside the b-type arrs, other factors are involved in mediating the transcriptional response to cytokinin. these include a subgroup of the erf/ap <dig> transcription factor family named cytokinin response factor   <cit> , members of the gebp transcription factor family  <cit>  and gata <dig>  <cit> .

an interesting feature of cytokinin is its opposite activity in regulating growth of roots and shoots. cytokinin is a negative regulator of root growth and branching. plants with a reduced cytokinin status – generated either by reduction of the endogenous cytokinin content  <cit>  or by disruption of cytokinin signalling  <cit>  show enhanced root growth. in the root apical meristem, cytokinin promotes the transition from cells to differentiation  <cit>  acting through the auxin-response factor iaa3/shy <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, cytokinin retards cellular differentiation in the shoot apical meristem by interacting with the wus/clv pathway, as well as by a separate pathway  <cit> . similarly, cytokinin inhibits root branching  <cit> , but stimulates the growth of lateral shoots  <cit> . moreover, a high cytokinin:auxin ratio favours shoot induction in undifferentiated callus tissue, while a low cytokinin:auxin ratio leads to the formation of roots  <cit> . in addition to these developmental changes, it has been shown that cytokinin-deficiency has different consequences on the primary metabolism of root and shoot tissue  <cit> .

different activities of cytokinin in the two organs could be partly realized through a different transcriptional response. shoots and roots express specific sets of genes  <cit> . here we describe the results of a genome-wide expression profiling of roots and shoots of seedlings treated with cytokinin for different periods of time. in addition, we compared the root and shoot transcriptomes of wild-type plants with those of cytokinin-deficient plants overexpressing the cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase gene ckx <dig> under the control of the 35s promoter  <cit> . we looked for similarities and differences of cytokinin-dependent gene expression in roots and shoots to identify genes with organ-specific regulation, as well as to assign a root- or shoot-specific response to already known cytokinin-regulated genes. the results of this transcript profiling approach are a starting point for further research into the differential responses of roots and shoots to cytokinin.

RESULTS
in order to search for short-term and long-term effects on the transcriptome, we treated 5-d-old wild-type seedlings with cytokinin for  <dig> min ,  <dig> h , and  <dig> h  and harvested roots and shoots separately. to contrast the cytokinin induction, we analyzed root and shoot samples of cytokinin-deficient 35s:ckx <dig> expressing seedlings of the same age . these seedlings contain about 38% of the cytokinin levels of wild-type seedlings in the roots and about 12% in the shoots  <cit> . the reference samples for the whole experiment were roots and shoots of mock-treated wild-type seedlings . mrna preparations were obtained from two biological replicates and subjected to microarray analysis as described in methods. the hybridization strategy used for this study yielded absolute expression values instead of the fold-changes usually obtained from two-colour microarrays. to identify cytokinin-regulated genes, we considered only those transcripts which were detected on at least 25% of the microarrays , because inclusion of weakly expressed genes caused a large number of false positives as determined by re-examination by qrt-pcr . in total,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were above the cutoff on the arrays used for the analysis of gene regulation by cytokinin treatment or cytokinin-deficiency, respectively. these genes were then classified as described in methods and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  genes with more than  <dig> -fold change of expression compared to the control samples are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  and additional file 3: table s <dig> , respectively. selected examples of these genes are listed in table  <dig>  and table  <dig>  and will be commented on further below.

the table contains an arbitrary selection of genes showing an organ-specific change of transcript abundance in response to cytokinin treatment. a number of these genes are discussed in the text. the categorization of genes was performed as described in methods and in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  expression ratios in roots and shoots at different time points in relation to the control are given and coded by different font variants: bold, upregulation; italics, downregulation; regular, no regulation. catma id, unique identifier for the gene specific tag  on the microarray ; abb, number of spots above background ; agi, unique gene identifier assigned by tair; description, edited tair database annotation. fdr corrected p-values ≤  <dig> , indicating whether a gene was significantly regulated by cytokinin, are marked with bold numbers.

the table contains an arbitrary selection of genes showing altered transcript abundance under cytokinin deficiency. a number of these genes are discussed in the text. the categorization was performed as described in methods and in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  expression ratios in roots and shoots of cytokinin-deficient seedlings relative to the wild-type control are given and coded by font variants: bold, upregulation; italics, downregulation; regular, no regulation. catma id, unique identifier for the gene specific tag  on the microarray ; abb, number of spots above background ; agi, unique gene identifier assigned by tair; description, edited tair database annotation. fdr corrected p-values ≤  <dig> , indicating whether a gene was significantly regulated by cytokinin, are marked with bold numbers.

global expression analysis by principal component analysis
in order to get an insight into the global structure of the complex dataset of this microarray investigation, we performed a principal component analysis  on a reduced dataset  using the steady-state mrna levels determined by the application of a common reference hybridization strategy . this type of analysis applied to the samples of a microarray experiment typically results in clusters of samples with a similar expression pattern, thereby revealing the main factors that lead to changes in gene expression. additionally, we performed a support tree  clustering, which served as a confirmation of the pca.

cytokinin deficiency has a large and specific influence on the transcriptome
the results of the pca show a separation of the dataset into distinct clusters . as expected, the largest distance was found between root and shoot samples confirming the functionality of the pca . the samples of the cytokinin-deficient plants were separated from the wild-type samples on a different axis than the organ effect . additionally, they form their own cluster in st clustering . the large distance of the cytokinin-deficient samples from the wild-type clusters means that cytokinin deficiency causes a global transcript change to an extent comparable to the difference between roots and shoots.

taken together, pca analysis groups the samples into four clusters — wild-type roots, wild-type shoots, cytokinin-deficient roots, and cytokinin-deficient shoots — each of which occupies one quadrant of the clustering space .

the cytokinin status influences the organ-specific transcriptome pattern
closer examination of the distribution of the samples within the clustering space revealed that a long-term cytokinin treatment of roots and constitutively lowered cytokinin content in shoots causes distinct changes of the gene expression pattern shifting the location of the root and shoot samples in the pca towards the respective other organ.

firstly, the long-term cytokinin-treated root sample is located more closely to the shoot coordinates than any other root sample . this change indicates that after  <dig> h of cytokinin treatment, a shift in gene expression towards a shoot-like pattern has started without gross visible developmental changes having occurred in the tissue. next, we looked for affected genes and identified these based on their differential expression between untreated roots and shoots , their altered expression level after  <dig> h of cytokinin treatment , and by their p-values of the organ, cytokinin and/or interaction effects . the transcripts of  <dig> genes are regulated in this fashion . among the  <dig> genes that are upregulated towards a more shoot-like transcript level in long-term cytokinin-treated roots, we identified genes encoding chloroplast-localized proteins as the major overrepresented gene ontology class  . these include genes encoding proteins necessary for plastid proliferation, such as the plastid developmental protein dag  and the chloroplast division protein ftsz . conversely,  <dig> predominantly root-expressed genes, such as at5g <dig> encoding the tonoplast intrinsic protein tip2; <dig> transporting ammonium across the tonoplast   <cit> , are repressed by long-term cytokinin treatment in roots. however, no overrepresented functional go category could be found among this group of genes. in comparison, only  <dig> genes acquired a more root-like expression upon cytokinin treatment of shoots  and no shift of the respective sample towards root-like expression was observed in the pca . no go category could be found to be overrepresented among these genes.

secondly, a similar, albeit opposite, developmental shift effect was observed in the shoot sample of cytokinin-deficient plants, which is located more closely to the root coordinates than any other shoot sample . this global shift of the transcript profile to a more root-like pattern suggests that, beside the visible reduction of shoot growth, a low cytokinin status reduces the “shootyness” of the global transcription pattern. we identified genes displaying a corresponding expression pattern as described above.  <dig> genes show a more root-like transcript level in shoots of cytokinin-deficient seedlings . also in this case, the set of  <dig> genes that was downregulated to a more root-like transcript level contains a high fraction  of chloroplast-related genes . the gene encoding the psbr subunit of photosystem ii , for example, is downregulated to about one tenth of its expression level in shoots of cytokinin-deficient plants. conversely,  <dig> otherwise predominantly shoot-expressed genes are stronger expressed in cytokinin-deficient roots , such as pin <dig>  encoding a root-specific auxin efflux carrier discussed further below, but no functional go category was found to be overrepresented among them.

interestingly,  <dig> of all regulated genes showing an enhanced transcript level in cytokinin-treated roots were also repressed in cytokinin-deficient shoots and vice versa indicating that these are particularly cytokinin-sensitive genes .  <dig> of the  <dig> genes enhanced by cytokinin in roots and repressed in cytokinin-deficient shoots encode plastid proteins with functions e.g. in the light reaction or the calvin cycle as well as several plastidal ribosomal proteins . examples of the  <dig> genes repressed by cytokinin in roots and enhanced in cytokinin-deficient shoots encode the predominantly root-expressed sodium transporter hkt <dig> discussed further below, and the signalling protein cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig> .

the table shows a list of genes, which have both a more shoot-like transcript level in long-term cytokinin-treated roots  and a more root-like transcript level in cytokinin-deficient shoots . expression ratios are given for long-term cytokinin-treated roots and for cytokinin-deficient shoots in comparison to the mock-treated wild-type samples, as well as for the difference between roots and shoots. the expression ratios are coded: by different font variants: bold, up-regulation; italic, downregulation, regular, no regulation. the fdr-corrected p-values for the cytokinin effect indicate whether a gene was significantly regulated by cytokinin. the fdr-corrected p-values for the organ effect indicate whether the expression level of a gene was significantly different in roots and shoots. the fdr-corrected p-value for the interaction effect indicates whether cytokinin-dependent gene regulation was dependent on the organ. fdr-corrected p-values ≤  <dig>  were regarded as significant and marked with bold numbers. catma id, unique identifier for the gene specific tag  on the microarray ; abb, number of spots above background ; agi, unique gene identifier assigned by tair; description, edited tair database annotation. abbreviations for the subcellular localization are: a, apoplast; c, cytosol; e, endoplasmatic reticulum; e, endomembrane system; m, mitochondrium; n, nucleus; p, plastid; p, plasma membrane; v, vacuole; w, cell wall; x, extracellular space; —, not available or unknown.

the fact that cytokinin deficiency results in downregulation of chloroplast genes in green tissue, whereas excess cytokinin causes chloroplast genes expressed in the root is consistent with a primary role of cytokinin in regulating plastid development  <cit> . it is noteworthy that only a fraction  of the ca.  <dig>  nuclear genes encoding plastidic proteins  <cit>  were affected by an altered cytokinin status, suggesting that cytokinin acts only on part of the genes and/or that there is a sequential order of cytokinin-regulated gene expression of which we detected only a part at the analyzed time point. consistent with our data others found also a strong increase of genes encoding plastid proteins in cytokinin-treated root callus tissue, albeit at much later time points  <cit> . the expression of a comparatively small number of genes was shifted towards a more shoot-like profile in cytokinin-deficient roots , and correspondingly no shift of the cytokinin-deficient root sample towards the shoot coordinates was observed in the pca .

taken together, these findings indicate that the cytokinin status apparently determines a more root- or shoot-like transcriptomic pattern that is at least partially independent of morphologically discernable altered organ identity. we used the category of nuclear genes encoding plastid proteins as a diagnostic tool to assess the “shootyness” of the transcriptome but it is impossible to determine whether the transcriptomic shift in “shootyness” is cause or consequence of a shift in organ identity. however, several studies dissecting the temporal pattern of gene expression during cytokinin-induced shoot development from root calli found that shoot marker genes start to be upregulated only several days after the onset of the hormonal treatment  <cit>  supporting the notion that during the time period analyzed here no shoot identity was obtained by the cytokinin-treated root tissue.

similarity of the overall transcriptional response of roots and shoots to cytokinin
the effect of cytokinin treatment at different time points was not resolved in the pca analysis, because the large organ and genotype effects prevailed. therefore, we removed the largest effect — the organ effect — by normalizing the root and shoot samples for each experimental condition as described in methods. as a result, support tree clustering showed distinct root-shoot-pairs at each experimental condition indicating that the overall transcriptional response to cytokinin is similar in roots and shoots . the two early time points of cytokinin induction showed the closest relation, while the long-term treated samples separated from the other wild-type samples.

pca analysis using this dataset normalized for the organ effect resolved two temporal phases of the transcriptomic response to cytokinin. for the early time points of cytokinin induction, the separation is approximately parallel to the z-axis and for the later time points parallel to the y-axis, suggesting that the late response affects a different set of genes than the early response . both root and shoot samples follow a similar pattern , indicating that the transcriptomic response to cytokinin treatment is similar in both organs. this conclusion was confirmed by an additional pca without the cytokinin-deficient samples, where the arrangement of the wild-type samples in one plane remained stable .

given the fundamental differences of the growth response of roots and shoots to cytokinin, we initially hypothesized that this could be reflected by large differences at the transcriptome level. in fact, cytokinin response genes are regulated by the hormone in a context-dependent manner  <cit> , which is likely due to the presence of multiple cis-regulatory elements in their promoters. indeed, the only known cytokinin response element is not present in the promoters of all cytokinin responsive genes  <cit> , suggesting that a variety of possibilities exist to regulate a gene by cytokinin. it might well have been possible that large specific subsets of genes are regulated by cytokinin in an organ-specific manner. however, that appears not to be the case. therefore it is remarkable and to some extent unexpected that the global transcriptional responses in both organs appear to be rather similar. this indicates that it is not the differential bulk expression determining the rather different cytokinin-dependent growth responses in both organs. this would also imply that cytokinin signaling to the nucleus is to a large extent similar and that organ-specific features are limited to few changes, which regulate the growth response. it would be very interesting to find out how these comparably small differences can drive completely different growth responses in roots and shoots. furthermore, because of these relatively small differences one can expect a relatively low number of genes that are regulated by cytokinin in an organ-specific manner.

it should be noted that the absolute expression level of the genes, although showing qualitatively similar cytokinin responses, can be quite different in roots and shoots . for instance, the transcripts encoding the auxin transporter pin <dig> or the tonoplast intrinsic protein tip2; <dig> are more than hundred-fold more abundant in the root than in the shoot, while the phosphate transporter gene pht2; <dig> shows a much higher expression level in the shoot . thus the differential response of the tissues to cytokinin may be affected by additional factors that regulate the absolute abundances of the different messages.

chronic cytokinin deficiency and cytokinin induction affect different sets of genes
the pca of the normalized dataset  shows that the ckx samples separate from the wild-type samples along the x-axis while the effects of cytokinin treatment on the transcriptome are distributed over the y- and z-axes and remain within the same plane . this means that the transcriptomic changes resulting from chronic cytokinin deficiency are not simply the opposite of those resulting from early or late cytokinin treatment, but that another  set of genes is affected. consequently, we analyzed cytokinin-deficiency separately from the dataset derived from the cytokinin-induced plants.

regulation of cytokinin metabolism and signalling genes
to search for potential homeostatic mechanisms within the cytokinin system, we studied the influence of cytokinin treatment and cytokinin deficiency on the transcript level of cytokinin metabolism and signalling genes . unfortunately, the catma microarray lacks a part of these cytokinin-related genes and expression of another part was below the detection limit. therefore, only a limited number of the relevant genes could be analyzed. a subset of these showed significant differences in organ specificity and cytokinin response of transcript abundance.

among the cytokinin-synthesizing ipt genes, ipt <dig> showed a higher expression in the shoot under all conditions, while ipt <dig>  was consistently more highly expressed in the root . ipt <dig> was strongly downregulated in long-term cytokinin-treated roots and upregulated in cytokinin-deficient shoots . in contrast, a strong upregulation in long-term cytokinin-treated roots was detected for ipt <dig>  and ipt <dig> was apparently neither differentially expressed nor regulated by cytokinin. the gene encoding the cytokinin hydroxylase cyp735a <dig> was strongly upregulated by cytokinin in a root-specific fashion . among the cytokinin-degrading ckx genes, strong differences were found for ckx <dig> and ckx <dig>  confirming previous data  <cit> . both genes were expressed more strongly in the root than in the shoot and both were upregulated by cytokinin and downregulated under conditions of cytokinin deficiency, the response in the root being stronger than in the shoot . ckx <dig> has been consistently described as a primary target gene of b-type response regulator arr <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to these two genes, ckx <dig> was expressed more strongly in the shoot and was hardly regulated by the cytokinin status in our study. please note that the strong upregulation of ckx <dig> found in cytokinin-deficient roots results from detection of the transgene. of the putative cytokinin transporter genes, pup <dig> and pup <dig> <cit>  were more strongly expressed in the root and both showed a transient upregulation in the shoot but not in the root in response to cytokinin .

the known higher expression of the cytokinin receptor gene cre1/ahk <dig> in the root  <cit>  and its induction by cytokinin  <cit>  was confirmed. the transcript level of the two b-type arabidopsis response regulator genes  were more strongly expressed in the root and – as expected – not regulated by cytokinin . in contrast, all known primary cytokinin response genes encoding a-type response regulators  detected were equally responsive to cytokinin in both roots and shoots . figure 3b shows the reduced expression levels of four exemplary a-type arr genes  in 35s:ckx <dig> transgenic roots and shoots as compared to the corresponding wild-type tissues and their induction pattern following cytokinin treatment in roots and shoots of the wild type . despite a generally similar response to an altered cytokinin status, the kinetics and amplitudes of changes in steady state transcript levels differ for the four genes.

together, these data confirm that the transcript abundance of several cytokinin metabolism and signalling genes depends on the cytokinin status  <cit>  indicating regulatory loops between cytokinin metabolism and signalling. the analysis also showed that the reaction patterns are not uniform but complex, with differences in kinetics and organ specificity.

known and novel genes responding to cytokinin
in the following sections we will analyse separately the sets of genes that show altered expression patterns following either a treatment of seedlings with cytokinin or under conditions of constitutive cytokinin deficiency . the organ-specific regulation of some known cytokinin response genes will be addressed and an arbitrary selection of novel cytokinin-regulated genes, which may have escaped previous discovery due to unspecific sampling, is discussed. we will explore similar and differential changes of steady-state transcript levels in both organs, as well as changes that are restricted to either roots or shoots. this organizing principle is followed, although in part genes belonging to a similar context  were categorized into different groups of organ-specific cytokinin-regulation.

cytokinin-induced changes of transcript abundance
 <dig>  of the  <dig>  genes  that were detected by the arrays were responsive to a short-term or long-term cytokinin treatment . out of these,  <dig> genes could be assigned unambiguously to one specific category as follows: the majority, i.e.  <dig> genes, were regulated in both organs with either a similar or differential expression pattern. the former genes  were regulated in both organs in the same direction, while the latter genes  were regulated in both organs in the opposite direction.  <dig> genes were regulated by cytokinin in a root-specific fashion, and  <dig> genes were regulated in a shoot-specific fashion. a large number of genes  were regulated significantly by cytokinin under at least one of the experimental conditions, but lacked a significant organ effect. most of these genes showed a different steady-state transcript level at only one time point . they were not further analysed, as the focus of this work was on organ specificity.  <dig> genes were classified as non-regulated under our conditions .

assignment of organ-specificity to known cytokinin response genes
firstly, we examined whether we could assign a root- or shoot-specific response to known cytokinin-regulated genes which had been discovered previously by genome-wide microarray analyses  <cit> . in fact, a large number of these genes were detected by the catma array and most, but not all, of them were found to be regulated in both organs .

a selection of previously published cytokinin-responsive genes from various publications reporting changes within  <dig> h were analyzed for their changes in transcript abundance in response to cytokinin induction or cytokinin deficiency in root and shoot samples. expression ratios are coded by font-variants as described for table  <dig>  significance codes indicate p-values calculated as described in methods:  <dig>  > · >  <dig>  > *  <dig>  > **  <dig>  > ***. genes that were published in at least two previous publications and selected examples of known regulated genes that were only published once are listed here. in addition, selected examples of known regulated genes that were only published once were added. a more comprehensive list of genes can be found in additional file 9: table s <dig>  the publications are coded by letters: a, rashotte et al.,  <dig>  <cit> ; b, brenner et al.,  <dig>  <cit> ; c, kiba et al.,  <dig>  <cit> ; d, rashotte et al.,  <dig>  <cit> ; e, taniguchi et al.,  <dig>  <cit> ; f, argyros et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . agi, unique gene identifier assigned to arabidopsis thaliana genes by tair.

a noteworthy example of a root-specific cytokinin response gene encodes the cytokinin hydroxylase cyp735a <dig> which responded strongly to cytokinin within minutes. its transcript level in roots after  <dig> min of cytokinin treatment was strongly increased, while it was non-responsive in shoot tissue . significantly, the basal level of cyp735a <dig> expression was similar in both roots and shoots . this regulation is interesting because the hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of isopentenyl riboside phosphates to trans-zeatin  riboside phosphates  <cit> , which are inactive precursors of tz-type cytokinins. tz-type cytokinins are the main cytokinins transported in the xylem from roots to shoots  <cit> . the exclusive induction of cyp735a <dig> by cytokinin in roots, which probably results in a locally increased production of tz-type cytokinins, lends support to tz-type cytokinins having a distinct role in root-to-shoot communication  <cit> .

an example of a shoot-specific regulated known cytokinin response gene is cdka; <dig>  encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase gene. cdka; <dig> is an important cell cycle regulator and is involved in a variety of developmental processes. because cells expressing more cdka; <dig> are more competent for cell division, it is thought to be a prerequisite for post-embryonic cell division  <cit> . it was shown recently that the cdk activity level in the shoot apical meristem is important for cellular differentiation  <cit> , a process that is under cytokinin control  <cit> . cdka; <dig> regulation in the shoot by cytokinin could be part of the activities orchestrated by cytokinin in the shoot apical meristem.

the organ-specificity of some other known cytokinin response genes is also described in the following sections.

genes with a similar response in roots and shoots upon cytokinin treatment
of the  <dig> genes displaying a similar cytokinin response in roots and shoots,  <dig> genes showed an increased transcript level following cytokinin treatment, while the transcript level of  <dig> genes was reduced .  <dig> genes showed a rapid change of transcript abundance within  <dig> min and thus belong to the immediate-early response genes. the vast majority of the changes became apparent  <dig> min or  <dig> min after the treatment. interestingly, the transcript level of many genes that was increased after  <dig> min remained increased also after  <dig> min. as already mentioned above, it should be noted that there are substantial differences in the basal expression levels of numerous of these genes in roots and shoots which could be of functional relevance as well. an example is the clv <dig> gene discussed below, which is approx. 4-fold higher expressed in the untreated wild-type shoots compared to the roots .

among the upregulated developmental genes, a particularly interesting one encodes the clavata  formation protein shepherd . shd is a member of the hsp <dig> protein family and has been suggested to act as a chaperone for the correct folding of nascent clv <dig> and/or clv3-like polypeptides in the endoplasmatic reticulum  <cit> . consistently, shd mutant plants are phenotypically reminiscent of clv mutants. the clv <dig> and clv <dig> proteins are part of the regulatory loop controlling meristem size and activity in concert with wuschel   <cit> . cytokinin regulates the expression of clv <dig> and wus, thereby controlling meristematic activity  <cit> . transcriptional regulation of the shd gene possibly represents an additional activity of cytokinin in regulating meristematic activity.

members of the erf/ap <dig> family were noticeably frequent among the cytokinin-responsive transcription factor genes. the transcript levels of eight members of the family  were strongly downregulated by the hormone, but none was upregulated . this shows that, in addition to the erf/ap <dig> subclass of cytokinin-regulated factors  with its current six members  <cit> , other members of other subclades of the erf/ap <dig> family are also cytokinin-regulated .

interestingly, numerous ribosomal genes were identified as cytokinin responsive in this study as well as in previous studies  <cit> . several developmental processes react sensitively to mutations in ribosomal genes, including embryogenesis, root growth and leaf development, underpinning the functional relevance of the specific assembly of ribosomal proteins in addition to their fundamental role in translation, possibly because they are required to translate specific proteins  <cit> . according to the gene ontology database of may  <dig>  the arabidopsis genome encodes  <dig> ribosomal proteins  <cit>  and at least  <dig> transcripts of them responded to cytokinin . the cytokinin-responsive ribosomal genes encode proteins of both plastidic and cytoplasmic localisation. noteworthy, most of the transcripts of nuclear genes encoding plastidic ribosomal proteins reflect the organ shift discussed above, i.e. induction in long-term cytokinin-treated roots and downregulation in cytokinin-deficient shoots. ribosomal genes encoding cytosolic proteins show diverse cytokinin response patterns. the altered composition of ribosomes and the translational changes that this may cause are a largely unexplored part of the cytokinin response.

the flavonol synthase gene fls <dig> was strongly upregulated, particularly in the shoot. fls <dig> is part of the flavonol biosynthesis pathway  <cit>  and it is likely that its strong upregulation is part of the induction of anthocyanin accumulation by cytokinin  <cit> . cytokinin and flavonoids are involved in regulating several developmental processes: both, for example, are positive regulators of nodule organogenesis  <cit>  but have opposite roles in the control of shoot branching  <cit> . flavonoids are inhibitors of auxin transport and thus may mediate crosstalk between cytokinin and auxin action. in any case, there are multiple links between cytokinin and flavonoids and effects on the fls <dig> transcript level could be part of that. fls <dig> was also found among the strongly upregulated genes in cytokinin-deficient plants , illustrating nicely that cytokinin deficiency does not simply induce the opposite changes caused by cytokinin treatment, as already shown by the pca discussed above.

five members of the nodulin mtn <dig> gene family are downregulated by cytokinin: at2g <dig>  at4g <dig>  at4g <dig>  at4g <dig>  and at3g <dig> . the role of nodulin mtn21-like genes is not yet understood, but the presence of seven transmembrane domains and structural homologies with bacterial multidrug exporters might suggest a role in a transport function. it was proposed that the maize nodulin mtn21-like gene is probably involved in the transport of a component related to vascular tissue assembly  <cit> , which is interesting in view of the role of cytokinin in vascular development  <cit> .

several other regulated genes can be associated with known functions of cytokinin, such as crosstalk with other hormones including auxin  and gibberellin  or its functions in mineral uptake  .

root-specific changes in gene expression upon cytokinin treatment
among the  <dig> genes that were regulated only in roots, the strongest differences in expression level were detected for a gene encoding a member of the legume lectin family protein, its transcript abundance increased >150-fold . as has been discussed above, the largest specific group of regulated genes encoded plastid proteins, and a particularly interesting gene showing root-specific regulation was cytokinin hydroxylase gene cyp735a <dig>  a root-specific regulation by cytokinin was assigned to two other cytochrome p <dig> genes for which cytokinin-regulation has been previously described  <cit> . one of them, at2g <dig>  encodes the c <dig> sterol desaturase cyp710a <dig> involved in brassinosteroid metabolism. it catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of brassicasterol and stigmasterol  <cit> . this is interesting as cytokinin and brassinosteroids have been recently shown to act in common pathways in regulating root architecture  <cit> . the molecular basis for this crosstalk is not known but it is conceivable that regulation of metabolism genes may be part of it. noticeably, the related gene encoding cyp710a <dig> and the brassinosteroid biosynthesis gene dim/dwf are deregulated in cytokinin-deficient plants  indicating that brassinosteroid metabolism is regulated by cytokinin on different levels.

the largest fold-change in transcript abundance between roots of the cytokinin-deficient and long-term cytokinin-treated seedlings was noted for the lbd <dig> gene, encoding a member of the lob domain protein family  <cit>  and already noted before in relation to cytokinin  <cit> . the function of lbd <dig> is unknown, but members of this plant-specific family of dna-binding transcription factors are involved in various developmental processes, such as leaf polarity, and floral or inflorescence architecture in different plant species  <cit> , as well as lateral root formation and the regulation of anthocyanin and nitrogen metabolism  <cit> .

again, a number of genes were identified that are relevant for auxin action, e.g. encoding the iaa-amido synthase dfl <dig>  and pin <dig> , suggesting that cytokinin-auxin crosstalk is realized in many different ways in a tissue-specific fashion. similarly, genes encoding proteins involved in mineral uptake are also regulated in a root-specific fashion, including iron transporter gene irt <dig> as well as phosphate  and sulfate transporter genes .

shoot-specific changes in gene expression upon cytokinin treatment
 <dig> genes were exclusively regulated in the shoot, of which  <dig> were upregulated , and  <dig> were downregulated, in both cases most consistently after  <dig> and  <dig> min. one of the most prominent genes that was rapidly and strongly downregulated in the shoot is clv <dig> . its negative regulation by cytokinin has been previously reported  <cit> , but the shoot-specific nature of this was not known. similarly, cytokinin regulation of crf <dig>  encoding a member of the subfamily b- <dig> of the erf/ap <dig> transcription factor family , had been shown before  <cit> , but not its shoot-specificity . another member of the erf/ap <dig> transcription factor family , erf <dig> , is one of the most strongly downregulated genes in the shoot . erf <dig> is an activator of gcc box-dependent transcription and is also regulated by ethylene and abiotic stress  <cit> .

the gene encoding the digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase  <dig>  was upregulated almost 6-fold by cytokinin treatment. dgd <dig> catalyzes the synthesis of the galactolipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol , requiring monogalactosyldiacylglycerol  as a substrate, which is synthesized by mongalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase   <cit> . both galactolipids constitute the predominant and functionally relevant component of thylakoid membranes  <cit> . previously, it was shown that the accumulation of mgdg in cucumber seedlings required cytokinin in addition to light, and that both factors play a co-operative role  <cit> . the response of dgd <dig> shown here indicates that the cytokinin regulation also comprises this step of galactolipid synthesis, adding another example of the influence of the hormone on chloroplast function.

the serin/threonine protein kinase gene pinoid  <cit> , encoding a regulator of the auxin response, is downregulated approximately 3-fold. pid phosphorylates the auxin efflux carrier proteins pin, thereby changing their apical-basal polar localization and thus increasing basipetal polar auxin transport  <cit> . although it is not known whether transcriptional regulation of pid plays a role in regulating its kinase activity, it is possible that the downregulation of pid by cytokinin causes an increase in basipetal auxin transport. in any case, in whatever functional context, regulation of pid by cytokinin could be a mechanism in addition to the known regulation of pin genes  <cit>  that contributes to the manifold regulatory influences of cytokinin on auxin function.

genes with differential expression patterns in root and shoot upon cytokinin treatment
 <dig> genes were upregulated in shoots and downregulated in roots or vice versa. the existence of such a differential organ-specific response pattern could be, for example, achieved by transcription factors that act depending on the cellular or developmental context either as activator or repressor  <cit> . however, given the low number of genes in this class and the frequently transient nature of their differential regulation, this does not seem to be a general feature of differential cytokinin activity in roots and shoots. two genes encoding cytochrome p <dig> enzymes belong in this class and show altered transcript levels at several time points . one of these genes encodes cyp83a <dig>  also called ref <dig> , catalyzing the initial conversion of aldoximes to thiohydroximates in the synthesis of glucosinolates not derived from tryptophan. it has also a role in auxin homeostasis  <cit> . f5h <dig>  encoding a ferulate 5-hydroxylase involved in lignification  <cit>  is regulated in the opposite way, namely up in the root and down in the shoot. the functional significance of this type of regulation is not known.

genes differentially expressed under conditions of constitutive cytokinin deficiency
in cytokinin-deficient tissues of 35s:ckx <dig> plants,  <dig>  genes were detected, of which  <dig>   showed an altered transcript abundance compared to the wild type.  <dig> of these genes could be assigned to one specific category. the major effect of cytokinin deficiency was manifested in the shoot, where  <dig> genes were differently expressed.  <dig> of these genes were exclusively affected in this organ and  <dig> were affected in the root as well. a smaller number of  <dig> genes were regulated only in the root and  <dig> genes were identified showing differential regulation in root and shoot . one outcome of the analysis was the relatively small overlap of genes affected by cytokinin-deficiency or cytokinin-treatment as described above. there are examples of opposite gene regulation in both conditions, e.g. the a-type arr genes, which are upregulated by cytokinin and downregulated under cytokinin deficiency. conversely, there are several cases of a change of transcript level in the same direction under both conditions  illustrating that opposite hormonal conditions may have a similar effect on transcript abundance. the relative shift of the shoot expression pattern towards a more root-like pattern, especially concerning genes encoding plastid proteins, was particularly noteworthy in the light of the effects of long-term cytokinin treatment on the roots described above. in addition, the data show that roots and shoots clearly react with different trancriptomic changes to cytokinin deficiency. exceptions are general indicators of the cytokinin status, such as the a-type arr genes, which are lowered in both organs . the alteration of the transcript level of several regulated genes may contribute to the establishment of the cytokinin deficiency syndrome.

genes with similar reaction in root and shoot under constitutive cytokinin deficiency
 <dig> genes showed a similar response in roots and shoots:  <dig> thereof were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated . there are several regulated genes that provide insight into the biological functions of cytokinin, such as the strong downregulation of nitrate reductase genes nr <dig> and nr <dig> reflecting the functional link between cytokinin and nitrogen usage  <cit> .

a very strongly altered expression level was shown by the sodium transporter gene hkt <dig>  which was upregulated 24-fold in roots and 16-fold in shoots . the main function of hkt <dig> is the control of na+ entry into plant roots and the root/shoot distribution of na+ <cit> . thus, hkt <dig> has an important role in mediating salt tolerance, as has been shown in ecotypes as well as by forward genetics, and it has been utilized to generate salt-tolerance using a transgenic approach  <cit> . the regulation found here is consistent with the previous finding that hkt1; <dig> is repressed by cytokinin treatment but showed significantly elevated expression in the b-type response regulator double mutant arr <dig> arr <dig> <cit> . these data suggested that cytokinin, acting through the transcription factors arr <dig> and arr <dig>  regulates sodium accumulation in the shoots by controlling the expression of hkt <dig> in the roots. cytokinin receptors ahk <dig> and ahk <dig> were consistently identified as negative regulators of the osmotic stress response and receptor mutants as well as mutants with a reduced cytokinin content were found to be salt resistant  <cit> . another cytokinin-regulated transporter gene was zip <dig> , which encodes a zn2+ transporter and was upregulated  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in shoots and roots, respectively  <cit> . its upregulation by cytokinin deficiency is in accord with the finding that cytokinin-deficient plants accumulate higher amounts of zn2+ in their shoot tissue  <cit> .

among the transcription factor genes, four erf/ap <dig> transcription factor genes  are downregulated to about one third of their expression level . interestingly, three of them are identical to the cytokinin-regulated ap2/erfs mentioned above , indicating again that increase and decrease of the cytokinin status may have similar consequences.

myb <dig> is another strongly regulated transcription factor gene. myb <dig> belongs to subgroup  <dig> of the r2r3-myb family and is a flavonol-specific activator of flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> . together with its two other subgroup members, myb <dig> and myb <dig>  it strongly activates the promoters of genes encoding chalcone synthase , flavanone 3-hydroxylase , flavonol synthase , and – to a lesser extent – chalcone flavanone isomerase , which are all involved in the formation of flavonols  <cit> . the upregulation of myb <dig> consistently resulted in an enhanced transcript level of chs  and fls <dig> . we hypothesize that cytokinin-deficient plants contain higher levels of flavonols and/or flavonoids, which have a variety of functions in plant stress defence. interestingly, auxin and ethylene induce flavonol accumulation through partly identical transcriptional networks  <cit> .

two well known auxin-related genes, pin <dig> and axr <dig>  were upregulated under cytokinin-deficiency. pin <dig> belongs to those genes which show a much higher shoot expression in response to cytokinin deficiency  while it is normally predominantly expressed in roots . pin <dig> encodes a member of the auxin efflux carrier proteins  <cit> . its regulation by cytokinin has been reported in the context of root meristem size regulation  <cit> , but it might also be involved in co-ordinating the activities of cytokinin and auxin in regulating root gravitropism  <cit> . axr <dig>  which was upregulated about 5-fold in both organs, encodes part of a dimeric e <dig> ubiquitin-activating enzyme of the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway  <cit>  mainly involved in regulating the auxin response, but also other signalling pathways dependent on ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation  <cit> . the upregulation of axr <dig> may enhance the potential for neddylation of proteins to be targeted for degradation by the proteasome. the aux/iaa proteins, transcriptional repressors of auxin-inducible genes, are primary targets of this pathway. higher expression of axr <dig> under cytokinin-deficiency suggests an enhanced auxin signalling in cytokinin-deficient plants. the identification of axr <dig> as a regulatory target of cytokinin adds another potential regulatory level to cytokinin-auxin interaction, which, because of the involvement of axr <dig> in auxin signalling in many tissues, might be of general relevance for the whole plant.

root-specifically altered transcript levels under constitutive cytokinin deficiency
the transcript level of  <dig> genes was changed in a root-specific fashion:  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated . the strongest upregulation in roots showed a gene for an amino acid transporter family protein  which was increased 18-fold .

the transcript of the clv3-related gene cle <dig>  was upregulated  <dig> -fold under cytokinin deficiency, however, the p-value  was slightly above our threshold . there is not much known about the actual function of cle <dig>  however, cle <dig> complemented the clv <dig> mutant well and also requires clv <dig> for signalling, and thus it may be considered a functional homologue  <cit> . the role of clv <dig> and related cle peptides in the shoot apical meristem has been investigated in great detail  <cit> . however, they are equally important in root meristem maintenance. overexpression, as well as the exogenous application of several cle peptides – including clv <dig> – to roots, results in the consumption of root meristematic cells  <cit>  and both clv <dig> and cle <dig>  its functional orthologue in roots, promote differentiation in the distal root meristem. cle <dig> forms a ligand-receptor pair with acr <dig> to regulate wox <dig> expression, resulting in a similar regulatory loop for the balance between proliferation and differentiation as the clv/wus system in the shoot meristem  <cit> . it could be that the root-specific upregulation of cle <dig> under cytokinin deficiency is functionally relevant for the altered differentiation behaviour of cytokinin-deficient roots  <cit> .

shoot-specifically altered transcript levels under constitutive cytokinin deficiency
 <dig> genes were deregulated in a shoot-specific fashion in 35s:ckx <dig> transgenic seedlings, which is a more complex response compared to roots.  <dig> of the genes were upregulated and many showed very strong changes  of their expression level and a strong shift towards root-like expression  which has caused the shift of the cytokinin-deficient root sample towards a more root-like position in the pca analysis discussed above. interestingly, the three most strongly downregulated genes and two more genes with strongly reduced transcript levels encode ap2/erf transcription factors , four of which are identical to those downregulated by cytokinin treatment  mentioned above.

several components of the light signalling network, in particular linked to phytochrome a, were found to be deregulated in cytokinin-deficient shoots. spa <dig> and cop <dig> belong to the upregulated genes, while the phya transcript itself is downregulated to one third of its level in wild-type plants . phya is involved in two light responses: the very-low-fluence response  and the far-red-light-dependent high-irradiance response , the former promoting seed germination with very low quantities of red or far-red light and the latter promoting photomorphogenesis  <cit> . spa <dig>  and cop <dig>  are negative regulators of partial aspects of both vlfr and hir. cop <dig> and spa <dig> are able to form a complex which targets phya for proteolytic degradation, thereby promoting photomorphogenesis  <cit> . the upregulation of the cop <dig> and spa <dig> transcripts by cytokinin may contribute to the rapid degradation of phya in its pfr form and the transcriptional downregulation of phya by cytokinin is likely to attenuate phya accumulation. together, the gene regulation is consistent with altered light responses of cytokinin-deficient plants  <cit>  and the known links between cytokinin and light responses  <cit> .

finally, the transcript of the dim/dwf <dig> gene encoding an enzyme involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis  <cit>  was downregulated to one third of its wild-type level in cytokinin-deficient shoots. dim/dwf <dig> mutants are brassinosteroid-deficient and show the typical dwarfed phenotype. it would be interesting to study in what way an altered brassinosteroid level is causally involved in establishing the cytokinin deficiency syndrome of which reduced shoot growth is a hallmark  <cit> . in any case, together with the regulation of cyp710a and cyp710b genes mentioned above our results suggest an influence of cytokinin on brassinosteroid biosynthesis. reciprocal influences of the two hormones on the expression of their metabolism genes have been observed before; however, the regulation of brassinosteroid metabolism genes by cytokinin was described as being ambiguous and not allowing a clear prediction whether this results in an enhanced or decreased brassinosteroid level  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports hitherto unknown differences of transcriptomic changes in root and shoot tissues in response to cytokinin treatment or cytokinin deficiency. one interesting result was the shift of long-term treated wild-type root samples to a more “shoot-like” profile and the opposite shift of cytokinin-deficient shoot samples towards “root-like” expression, both primarily affecting nuclear genes encoding plastid proteins. it would be interesting to analyze whether the whole transcriptome reacts in a rheostat-like fashion to a change in cytokinin status. there are some noteworthy examples of tissue-specific cytokinin responses, the most prominent probably being the cytokinin hydroxylase gene cyp735a <dig>  which is strongly upregulated in root tissue but lacks a response in shoot tissue. this implies that strong negative regulators suppress the cytokinin response of cyp735a <dig> in shoot tissue. numerous novel cytokinin response genes were discovered which were missed previously because of unspecific sampling and it can be anticipated that studies with an even higher spatial resolution will continue to discover novel cytokinin-regulated genes in their functional context  <cit> . several novel regulatory influences of cytokinin on metabolism and signalling genes of other hormonal regulators of plant development such as auxin and brassinosteroids were found. similarly, novel connections between cytokinin and environmental cues operating through transcriptional changes were unravelled supporting the notion that the hormone is involved in regulating a vast array of plant functions  <cit> . together these findings generate new hypotheses that need to be tested experimentally in order to fit them into the emerging picture of regulatory transcriptional networks  <cit> .
