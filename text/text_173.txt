BACKGROUND
a major class of heat shock proteins  belong to the ubiquitous hsp <dig> family, a diverse collection of 70 kda chaperones that exist in various cellular compartments. hsp70s perform essential housekeeping functions in protein folding, protein synthesis, translocation across membranes, protein degradation, assembly and disassembly of macromolecular complexes or aggregates, gene induction and apoptosis
. they are also involved in quality control process such as protein refolding after stress and control the activity of regulatory proteins in signal transduction pathways
 <cit> . all of these cellular activities of hsp <dig> depend upon its ability to interact with hydrophobic stretches of proteins in an atp-dependent manner preventing non-productive interactions that would lead to aggregation and to promote protein refolding
 <cit> . hsp <dig> constitutes one of the most highly conserved and well-studied hsps across species ranging from archaebacteria to plants and humans with the prokaryotic hsp <dig> protein dnak sharing approximately 50% amino acid similarity with eukaryotic hsp <dig> proteins
. various inter species expression studies of hsp <dig> showed its conserved functional properties across distant species
.

it had been suggested for a long time that the hsp <dig> isoforms are functionally redundant and differ only by their spatio-temporal expression pattern. however, this was challenged by several findings in saccharomyces cerevisiae  and higher eukaryotes demonstrating some functional specificity among hsp <dig> isoforms
 <cit> . in yeast, the hsp <dig> gene family comprises of fourteen genes, whose protein products share a sequence similarity of approximately 50-96%. of these, nine are cytosolic and five are compartmental specific. the major cytosolic hsp <dig> family in yeast is the hsp70-ssa , which consists of four members of ssa . these four isoforms are functionally redundant to some degree as expression of at least one family member is essential for growth
 <cit> . though other cytosolic hsp <dig> sub-families cannot substitute for the survival function of ssa sub-families, the four ssa proteins can compensate for each other
 <cit> . constitutively expressed ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> are 97% identical to each other and under optimal conditions ssa <dig> is approximately fourfold more abundant than ssa <dig> and depletion of ssa <dig> induces expression of ssa <dig>  maintaining overall hsp <dig> abundance. the heat-inducible ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> are 87% identical to each other and share an identity of 80% with ssa1/2
 <cit> . the heat inducible isoforms are expressed under non-optimal growth conditions and help protect cells from the adverse effects of stress
 <cit> . a major functional distinction between ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> exists in their effects on yeast prion propagation. the yeast  and  prions are infectious forms of the sup <dig>  and ure <dig>  proteins respectively
 <cit> . chaperones of various families, including hsp70s, have been shown to play an integral part in modulating prion propagation
 <cit> . overexpression of ssa <dig> but not ssa <dig>  can cure  while depleting ssa <dig> weakens  but not 
 <cit> . the functional difference in ssa <dig> or  <dig> in terms of prion propagation were found to be due to a single amino acid difference in the atpase of these highly homologous proteins
 <cit> . hsp <dig> has also been implicated in biofilm production in yeast, which is another good example of functionally specificity among the hsp <dig> isoforms
 <cit> . deletion of ssa <dig> had a more adverse effect on biofilm formation in yeast compared to ssa <dig> deletion. additionally, ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> deletion enhanced the defects brought about by ssa1/ssa <dig> deletion suggesting cooperation between constitutive and inducible isoforms of hsp70
 <cit> . recently it was shown that ssa <dig>  act as signal transducers mediating growth control through g <dig> cyclin abundance and activity, a process dependent on ssa phosphorylation status at a highly conserved threonine residue in the atpase domain
 <cit> . given the importance of the hsp <dig> family in essential cellular functions and also that hsp <dig> is a potential therapeutic target for a variety of human diseases, it is important to understand hsp70s essential and non-essential roles within the cell and to characterize the functional difference between members of this chaperone family.

here we make use of the genetically tractable yeast system. using the plasmid shuffle technique we constructed yeast strains expressing either ssa <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> as the sole source of hsp70-ssa protein in the cell. to provide new insights into functional conservation and redundancy in the hsp70-ssa family, we carried out a comparative phenotypic analysis of these strains coupled with a global transcriptome analysis.

methods
strains, plasmids and genetic methods
the yeast strain used in this study was g <dig> , pdcm <dig> , pa <dig>  and pa <dig>  were described by sharma et al. and schwimmer and masison
 <cit> . plasmid pdcm <dig> is a ura3-based low-copy plasmid containing a gene for expression of a thermolabile bacterial luciferase luxab
 <cit>  on a clai-smai fragment. the prs series of plasmids have been previously described by sikorski et al.
 <cit> .

monitoring of  was carried out as described by jones et al.
 <cit> . briefly, the presence of  and the weak suppressor trna suq <dig> in the strains were monitored as producing white colonies on media containing limiting amounts of adeneine, this is due to partial suppression and translation read through of the aberrant stop codon in the ade <dig>  allele
 <cit> . nonsuppressed ade2- <dig> mutants are adenine auxotrophs and are red when grown on adenine limiting media.

construction of g <dig> expressing only one hsp70-ssa family member
the plasmid shuffle technique was employed as essentially described by loovers et al.
 <cit>  with minor modifications. the g <dig> strain contains the plasmid prdw <dig>  which contains a ura <dig> marker and is the sole source of ssa in the strain. g <dig> was transformed with a leu <dig> plasmid expressing either ssa <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  transformation plates were replica plated onto selective medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid , a chemical that selects against ura <dig> cells and hence against the presence of the prdw <dig> plasmid. after 3 days at 30°c incubation, colonies were purified on medium lacking leucine and confirmed as uracil auxotrophs.

acquired thermotolerance assay
acquired thermotolerance assays were performed as described by jung et al.
 <cit>  with minor modifications. briefly, exponentially growing cultures were aliquoted and transferred to ice before exposing them to a temperature of 39°c for 1 hour to induce hsp <dig>  subsequently, 1 ml volumes of cell aliquots were maintained in a 47°c shaking incubator and transferred to ice at the indicated time points. serial dilution of the aliquots was carried out and the cells were spotted onto appropriate agar plates and incubated for 3 days at 30°c and growth were monitored over the period of time. the viability at time zero was set to 100%.

luciferase assay
luciferase refolding was assayed as essentially described by parsell et al.
 <cit> . overnight cultures were diluted to an od600nm =  <dig>  into the same selective medium and incubated at 37°c shaking for 30 minutes to induce expression of heat shock proteins. subsquently, cellular luciferase activity of each strain was measured immediately using a fb  <dig> luminometer  following addition of 10 μl decanal, and the cells were transferred to 45°c with shaking for 1 hour. cyclohexamide was added at a concentration of 10 μg/ml after 50 minutes at 45°c to prevent de novo synthesis of luciferase during the recovery period. cultures were then further incubated at 45°c for 10 minutes. cultures were shifted to 25°c for the recovery of cells from heat shock. thereafter, luciferase refolding activity was measured as described above at 15 minute time intervals  to check for luciferase recovery.

guanidine curing
routine curing of  strains was done by streaking the yeast strains on ypd plates containing 3 mm gdn-hcl and incubating the plates at 30°c for 3 days as essentially described by jung et al.
 <cit> . cells were re-streaked onto ypd and red colonies were isolated. both  and  versions of the strains were maintained at 4°c and the stock was stored at -70°c.

western analysis
western analysis was performed as described by moran et al.
 <cit> . hsp <dig> monoclonal antibody was purchased from cambridge biosciences   and hsp <dig> polyclonal antibody was a gift from john glover . antibodies specific for ssa1/ <dig> and ssa3/ <dig> were a gift from elizabeth craig .

rna extraction
total rna was extracted from 5-ml cultures of the  yeast strains expressing either ssa <dig>  ssa <dig>  ssa <dig> or ssa <dig> grown overnight at 30°c. rna was extracted using the qiagen rnaesy kit as per manufacturer’s recommendation. for each strain, three replicates were used and each experiment was conducted twice. rna was dnased-treated using turbo dna-free kit , according to the manufacturers recommendations. rna concentrations were measured using a nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer.

microarray analysis
for microarray analysis, equal amount of rna from all three replicates from two separate experiments were pooled together and sent to toray industries, japan. 3d-genetm yeast oligo chip s.cerevisiae 6 k was used for the microarray analysis. the microarray analysis was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions. in brief, arna  was synthesized from 1 μg total rna with amino allyl messageamptm ii arna amplification kit . 10 μg of arna was labelled with cy <dig> mono-reactivedyepack  and 1 μg of labelled arna was hybridized at 37°c  for 16 hours. the washed and dried dna chip was scanned by scanarray lite . the obtained microarray images were quantified using genepix pro <dig>  and the spot intensity was calculated by taking the median intensity of the foreground signals. the background signal intensity is derived by taking the mean signal intensity of the blank spots that excludes the top and bottom 5% signal intensities. the detected spots were defined as those that had signal intensity above the 95% upper confidence interval of the background signal intensity. for detected spots, their signal intensities were determined after subtracting with the mean background signal. for data comparison, the background-subtracted signal intensity was normalized using global normalization in which the median from each microarray was used. global normalize values were log-transformed to linearize the data and a heat map was created using tigr multiexperiment viewer 
 <cit> . all microarray data from this study are complaint with minimum information about a microarray experiment  and is publicly available through the ncbi's gene expression omnibus  database  under the series record gse <dig> 

real time rt-pcr analysis
real-time rt-pcr analysis was used to verify the microarray results. reverse transcription  of total rna was conducted as described by ali et al.
 <cit> . rt products were diluted to 200 μl and  <dig>  μl were pcr-amplified in a 25 μl volume reaction containing  <dig>  μl premix ex taqtm   and  <dig> nm each of forward and reverse transcript-specific primers . pcr reactions were conducted in a stratagene m×3000tm real-time pcr machine  and the programme consisted of 1 cycle of 95°c for 10 seconds, 40 cycles of 95°c for 5 seconds, 60°c for 30 seconds  and  <dig> further cycle of 95°c for 60 seconds prior to melting curve analysis. data were analysed using stratagene m×3000tm software . all the  <dig> rt samples along with their minus-rt product amplified for the s. cerevisiae act <dig>  gene and average threshold cycle  for rt samples was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  while ct value for the minus-rt samples were ≤ <dig> . the expression patterns of the act <dig> gene was used to normalise the rt-pcr data and the real-time quantification of target and housekeeping transcript accumulation was performed in separate reactions. the ct values obtained by real-time pcr  were used to calculate the accumulation of target gene , relative to act <dig> transcript, by 2^-∆∆ct method, where ∆∆ct = 
 <cit> . for each strain, three replicate samples were used and each experiment was conducted twice. the relative mrna accumulation were log-transformed to linearize the data and a heat map of was created using tigr multiexperiment viewer 
 <cit> .

statistical analysis
normal distributon of data set was determined using the ryan joiner test
 <cit>  within minitab . non-normally distributed data were transformed to fit a normal distribution using the johnson transformation
 <cit>  within minitab . the homogeneity of datasets across replicate experiments was confirmed by one-tailed correlation analysis conducted using mean data values  conducted within the statistical package for the social sciences  
 <cit> . therefore, datasets from the replicate experiments were pooled for the purposes of further statistical analysis. the significance of treatment effects was analysed using spss by either  normally distributed data - one-way anova with post hoc pair wise least significance difference  comparisons , or  non-normally-distributed data – the kruskal-wallis h test. correlations between mean values from different normally distributed datasets were calculated using pearson product moment analysis.

RESULTS
confirmation of individual hsp70-ssa expression and prion propagation phenotype in strain g402
to assess the functions of individual members of the ssa family, each member was expressed as a sole source of ssa in the g <dig> strain using the plasmid shuffle technique. to confirm the identity of the strains constructed we verified ssa chaperone protein expression and hsp <dig> expression levels using western blotting  and prion propagation phenotype . as reported previously by sharma et al.
 <cit>  the members of the ssa family individually supported the growth of g <dig> . the  strain was well maintained in cells expressing ssa <dig> and particularly ssa <dig> as the sole source of ssa, as seen by the pigmentation on ypd and growth on adenine lacking media . the prion phenotype was also maintained in cells expressing ssa <dig> but not to the same extent as ssa <dig> or  <dig>  while cells expressing only ssa <dig> were seen to impair the propagation of  the most dramatically , these findings are in agreement with sharma and masison
 <cit> . following plasmid shuffle all constructed strains were confirmed as  by mating analysis and curing with gdn-hcl. all ssa family members were well expressed from the ssa <dig> promoter and no major changes are seen in the expression levels of hsp <dig>  except perhaps for a minor increase when ssa <dig> is the sole ssa expressed . there are no major changes in ssa or hsp <dig> expression levels in  or  variants of strains used in this study . using well-established plate assays the curability of  appeared similar for cells expressing different hsp70-ssas to the prion-curing agents gdn-hcl, 6-aminophenanthridine and guanabenz acetate

acquired thermotolerance activity of the ssa family
the survival rate of yeast post-lethal heat shock can be greatly improved by pre-treating cells with mild non-lethal heat shock, which stimulates elevation of heat shock proteins, including hsp <dig> but primarily hsp104
 <cit> . previously it had been demonstrated that yeast cells expressing only ssa <dig> or ssa <dig>  were more heat tolerant than those expressing only ssa <dig> or ssa <dig> . it was suggested that this could be due to more efficient cooperation between inducible hsp70s with hsp <dig> compared to constitutive hsp70s
 <cit> . to address this question we carried out an acquired thermotolerance assay where the induced levels of hsp <dig> expression provide resistance to prolonged exposure at high temperature. to assess the possible influence of the prion on survival, we assessed both  and  variants. using this assay we find that both ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> show enhanced acquired thermotolerance compared to ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  and this difference is much more pronounced in  variants . we assessed the contribution of hsp <dig> to the enhanced thermotolerance of the inducible hsp70s by plating surviving cells on medium containing 3 mm gdn-hcl . gdn-hcl inhibits in vivo activity of hsp104
 <cit> . acquired thermotolerance was reduced for all strains compared to ypd medium, but the impact of hsp <dig> inhibition was much less reduced for cells expressing ssa <dig> as the sole hsp70-ssa. this suggests that ssa <dig> has a more significant role in hsp104-independent acquired thermotolerance compared to other ssa proteins or perhaps there are some other differences for ssa <dig> in terms of global transcriptomic or proteomic responses to heat shock or stress compared to other ssas.figure  <dig> 
acquired thermotolerance assays for ssa1- <dig>  overnight culture was diluted in fresh ypd medium to an od600nm =  <dig>  and then the cells were grown to exponential phase to a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml. cells were then re-suspended in fresh medium to a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml. an aliquot  was then shifted to ice. the cultures were then incubated at 39°c for 1 hour to induce hsp <dig> expression to protect against heat shock. cells were then incubated at 47°c for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 40 minutes  and plated on ypd and 3 mm gdn-hcl for comparative growth analysis. representative spots shown in the figure are a neat concentration from a  <dig> in  <dig> serial dilution series. the plates were then incubated at 30°c for 3 days and were monitored for cellular thermotolerance. cells without pre-treatment show virtually no growth at t <dig> .



in vivoprotein refolding ability of individual hsp70-ssas
we next assessed whether the in vivo protein refolding activity of the individual ssas reflected the results from the acquired thermotolerance plate assays. we used the in vivo reactivation of thermo-labile bacterial luciferase as a measure of protein refolding ability of hsp70-ssa chaperones . in contrast to the thermotolerance plate assays, ssa <dig> expressing cells were the most efficient at reactivating denatured luciferase with ssa <dig> eventually reaching comparable levels with ssa <dig> during the time course of the experiment. ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> showed similar activity but both reactivating approximately 20% less luciferase than ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> at the 45-minute time point. we also observed that the  variants of ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> were more efficient at luciferase reactivation compared to  variants . the reason for this difference is unknown, but is unlikely to be due to alterations in chaperone levels . as with the acquired thermotolerance plate assay, the presence of gdn-hcl in cultures prior to carrying out the assay causes a major reduction in luciferase refolding activity .figure  <dig>

differences in other stress phenotypes exhibited by the ssa family
in addition to differences in heat shock phenotypes of cells expressing different ssa family members, we also observed differences in responses to the cell wall damaging agent, sodium dodecyl sulfate   and the oxidative stress inducer, hydrogen peroxide  .figure  <dig>

cells expressing ssa <dig> exhibited greater resistance than other ssas to sds and the presence of  also had an influence on sds sensitivity for ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> expressing cells . such an influence of  has been observed previously for the closely related g <dig> strain
 <cit> , although in the case of g <dig> the reason for this effect is unknown.

similarly, we also see that cells expressing ether ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> exhibit greater resistance to h2o <dig> compared to ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> . additionally, a prion effect on sensitivity is also observed, however this effect is only seen for ssa <dig> with the  variant being more resistant than  at 3 mm h2o <dig> and higher. these results are reproducible but the reasoning behind this sensitivity profile is not known.

global transcription profile of yeast strains expressing individual ssa’s
although the hsp70-ssa family carry out non-redundant cellular functions, increasing evidence suggests an array of ssa family-specific functions exist. one such reason for the complex stress phenotypes exhibited in strains expressing individual hsp70-ssas could be due to changes in gene expression within the cell. we therefore assessed the global genome expression patterns for  variants for cells expressing individual hsp70-ssa family members. we used cells expressing ssa <dig> as the control comparison. to assess global gene expression we used the highly sensitive yeast 3d-gene microarray platform . we identified a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes induced  and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes repressed  when ssa <dig>  ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> were expressed respectively as a sole source of ssa in the cells compared to ssa <dig> . the strain with ssa <dig> generated the highest differential expression with  <dig> genes induced and  <dig> genes repressed. in contrast, strains expressing only ssa <dig> or ssa <dig> proteins showed a relatively smaller number of induced  and repressed  genes.figure  <dig> 
comparative transcriptome profiling of the ssa family. a venn diagram representation of genes induced  or repressed  in different ∆ssa strains. analysis was performed relative to expression levels of g <dig> expressing ssa <dig> as sole source of cytosolic ssa protein.



an alternative way of assessing the strains expressing each individual hsp70-ssa family member is in terms of the gene deletions. effectively, cells expressing ssa <dig> can be viewed as a ∆ssa2∆ssa3∆ssa <dig> deletion strain, cells expressing ssa <dig> as a ∆ssa1∆ssa3∆ssa <dig> deletion strain, cells expressing ssa <dig> as a ∆ssa1∆ssa2∆ssa <dig> and cells expressing ssa <dig> as a ∆ssa1∆ssa2∆ssa <dig> deletion strain. by comparing and identifying the co-regulated genes shared amongst the ssa1/2/3/ <dig> classes we can infer the regulation patterns for single and double deletions of each ssa family member from our data. the overlapping circles in the venn diagram  shows the numbers of shared genes between each of the ssa family members and the gene identities are shown in additional file

rt-qpcr analysis was carried out to verify the microarray analysis. twenty five genes were chosen based on their putative function and to represent a range of differential expression values among strains expressing ssa <dig>  ssa <dig>  ssa <dig> or ssa <dig> as the sole source of ssa in the cells in a  background. the expression levels were normalised with a housekeeping gene act <dig> and were log transformed. the comparative overview of the rt-qpcr and microarray results showed high degree of correlation and demonstrated the efficacy of both experiments .figure  <dig>

 <cit> . results are based on two experiments, each with three replicates.



discussion
expressing each member of the cytosolic ssa family of hsp <dig> as the sole source of ssa to study the effect on prion propagation reinforces that yeast prion propagation and maintenance are influenced to varying degrees by different members.  is the infectious prion form of the sup <dig> protein  and  phenotype can be assessed by its ability to suppress the ade2- <dig> premature ochre mutation present within ade <dig> gene in strain g <dig>  sup <dig> protein  under normal conditions in the cell encodes a translation release factor
 <cit> . aggregation of the sup <dig> in  cells causes nonsense suppression because of the depletion of sup <dig> protein into an insoluble prion aggregate that is no longer functional. thus, the strength of prion phenotype is directly proportional to the amount of sup <dig> protein that has been depleted to insoluble prion aggregates
 <cit> . ssa family members differed in their abilities to propagate , with ssa <dig> being the most effective member in maintenance and propagation of , compared to other ssa proteins. this result is consistent with a previous study by sharma et al.
 <cit> . earlier studies by schwimmer et al. and roberts et al. <cit>  also found different effects of the ssa family on  propagation. for example, overexpression of ssa <dig> but not ssa <dig> can cure , whereas a mutation in ssa <dig> but not ssa <dig> impairs  propagation. recently, corresponding changes of a single atpase domain residue  in ssa <dig> or ssa <dig> was able to allow these hsp70-ssa family members to acquire the prion propagation behaviour of the other
 <cit> . it appears that the evolution and occurrence of multiple hsp70s within a species may be due to modified regulation of hsp <dig> substrate-binding activity rather than changes to range of substrate that is recognised
 <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, the activity of ssa proteins is regulated by j-proteins
 <cit>  and nefs such as fes <dig> and sse1/2
. it has not been systematically tested whether the different ssa proteins have different affinities for j-proteins and nefs but remains an attractive possibility that this could partly explain different prion phenotypes when members of the ssa family are individually expressed as a sole source of ssa in the cell.

the hsp <dig> protein influences cell survival under prolonged exposure to high temperatures
 <cit> . at elevated temperatures, hsp <dig> activity allows cells to survive by resolubilising heat-denatured proteins
 <cit> . apart from hsp <dig>  refolding of misfolded protein requires the activity of additional chaperone proteins such as hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  thus hsp <dig>  in conjunction with hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  constitutes a protein disaggregation machinery leading to the resolubilisation of protein aggregates
 <cit> . both the constitutive and heat-inducible isoforms of hsp <dig> functioned well with hsp <dig> in refolding thermally denatured luciferase but preferentially, ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> were more active in vivo for luciferase refolding than ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> . such differences may be reflected by the specific hsp <dig> component of the protein disaggregation machinery. it has been proposed that heat inducible hsp70s may function more efficiently with hsp <dig> than constitutive hsp70s
 <cit> . however, this does not appear to be the case. ssa <dig> clearly provides better levels of acquired thermotolerance than other ssas , but even when cells are allowed to recover on medium that inhibits hsp <dig> activity , cells expressing ssa <dig> still recover remarkably well. this result suggests that for cells expressing ssa <dig> as the sole hsp70-ssa, there is a greater impact of factors other than hsp <dig> in determining levels of acquired thermotolerance. additionally, the assessment of refolding activity of a model substrate such as luciferase does not necessarily correlate well with the in vivo refolding activity required for survival of heat stress.

further complicating the interpretation of the luciferase refolding and acquired thermotolerance plate assays is the fact that ssa <dig> is the most efficient in refolding denatured luciferase but does match or improve upon ssa <dig> in the plate assay. additionally, the presence of  caused a clear and reproducible increase in efficiency in luciferase refolding in the ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> expressing strains , which did not translate to increased survival in the acquired thermotolerance plate assays . taken together these results also suggest a significant influence on levels of acquired thermotolerance from other cellular sources in addition to hsp <dig> 

following further phenotypic stress analysis we also identified differences between the ssas in response to oxidative and cell wall stress inducing agents . of particular note is the trend for the inducible ssas to provide better protection against both h2o <dig> and sds. however, again a complex stress response is observed, as the presence of  appears to influence sensitivity to sds and to h2o <dig>  particularly when only ssa <dig> is expressed. the reason for this prion influence is not known, but has been observed before in the closely related strain g600
 <cit> . given that cells expressing only ssa <dig> have a much stronger prion phenotype  then prion-specific effects may be expected in these cells compared to others expressing different ssa family members.

the different and complex prion and stress phenotypes exhibited by cells expressing individual members of the hsp70-ssa family led us to hypothesize that in addition to any inherent functional differences that may exist amongst these highly homologous proteins, the potential existed for indirect phenotypic influences caused by changes in global gene expression. this hypothesis appears to hold true as under non-stress conditions and when expressed from the same promoter, there are many differences in the expression levels of a variety of genes between cells expressing different hsp70-ssa family members . the changes in expression levels are in genes that are involved in a diverse set of cellular functions that would be predicted to influence a variety of cellular phenotypes . the full cellular implications for these changes in gene expression are difficult to interpret, but some inferences can be made in respect of the stress phenotypes we have observed in this study. for instance, cells expressing either ssa <dig> or ssa <dig> showed a 3-fold repression of cta <dig>  cta <dig> encodes catalase a, which is involved in hydrogen peroxide detoxification in the peroxisomal and mitochondrial matrices
 <cit> . additionally, ctt <dig>  a catalase that has a role in protection of cell from oxidative damage caused by hydrogen peroxide
 <cit> , was over 2-fold repressed in ssa <dig>  repression of these genes could be an influencing factor in the comparative sensitivity to h2o <dig> of cells expressing solely ssa <dig>  also, the transcriptional profiling of the ssa family also revealed that the trx <dig> gene, which confers resistance to h2o <dig> <cit> , was among the top listed induced genes in ssa <dig> strain and this may provide an explanation for the comparative resistance to h2o <dig> displayed by cells expressing solely ssa <dig>  in addition to this, two other genes, gpx <dig>  which is a glutathione peroxidise that is induced by oxidative stress
 <cit>  and grx <dig>  which is a glutaredoxin were induced  only in ssa <dig> expressing cells. glutaredoxins are the source primary defenses against mixed disulfides formed following oxidative damage to proteins
 <cit> .

further linking phenotype to possible changes in gene expression, we observed changes in genes involved in cell wall integrity  signalling in ssa <dig> expressing cells. the sensitivity of the  variant of ssa <dig> to  <dig> % sds  compared to  variant of other ssas, suggests a possible reduced efficiency in cell wall integrity signalling in the ssa <dig> strain. the sensitivity displayed by cells expressing ssa <dig> may be explained by the suppression of two genes, lrg <dig> and pmt <dig>  lrg <dig> is a gtpase - activating protein  that is involved in the pkc1-mediated signalling pathway that controls cell wall integrity
 <cit> , while pmt <dig> belongs to a family of protein mannosyltransferases that catalyses the transfer of mannose from dolichyl phosphate-d-mannose to protein serine/threonine residues of secretory proteins, a reaction essential for cell wall rigidity and cell integrity
 <cit> . both of these genes were repressed in only ssa <dig> expressing cells by over 2-fold . our findings implicate a possible role for hsp70-ssa family in the cwi signalling pathway.

a previous study comparing the global gene expression changes in yeast upon mild heat shock to those for yeast cells deleted for both ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  identified differential expression of groups of genes that are very distinct from those identified in our analysis
 <cit> . significant differences in strain background and ssa deletion status exists between these studies and therefore a direct comparison between global gene expression data is not possible.

CONCLUSIONS
while it is clear that hsp70-ssa family members provide redundant functions within the yeast cell, it is also evident that within groups of highly homologous hsp70s, family members may evolve to be much more efficient at aspects of these shared functions or have even developed new specific roles within the cell. however, a major conclusion from this study is that while some phenotypic differences observed between cells expressing different hsp70-ssa family members may result in part from intrinsic functional differences between hsp70s, a significant contribution to strain phenotype may also be attributed to major changes in global gene expression within the cell.
