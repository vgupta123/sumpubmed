BACKGROUND
determination of motor output maps by transcranial magnetic stimulation  proved to be a useful tool allowing the study of the cortical representation of various muscles  <cit> , and showing a high map stability and reproducibility  <cit> . serial tms mappings can be used to assess short-term plastic changes of the motor cortex induced by the repetitive performance of a motor task consisting of a synchronised movement of two limb muscles. this was demonstrated by a shift of the centre of gravity  of the motor output map derived from a small hand muscle towards the representation of the co-contracted shoulder  <cit>  or leg muscle  <cit> . hence this model was used to study the effect of different central acting drugs on short-term motor cortex plasticity: the gabaa agonist lorazepam and the n-methyl-d-aspartate -antagonist amantadine were found to block such cortical plastic changes  <cit> , whereas the indirect dopaminergic and adrenergic agonist amphetamine and the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine enhanced training induced cortical plasticity  <cit> . similar effects of gabaa agonists, nmda antagonists and amphetamine were reported in series of studies using different paradigms to study training-induced motor cortex plasticity by tms  <cit> , and coactivation-induced plasticity in the primary somatosensory cortex  <cit> . these results support the view that short-term plastic changes in the motor cortex are based on functional changes of synaptic activity, requiring removal of local  inhibition, as well as long-term potentiation -like changes which are mediated through nmda receptor activation  <cit> .

motor cortex plasticity, which occurs not only after motor training, but also after peripheral or central lesions  <cit> , might not necessarily be adaptive or beneficial: possible maladaptive consequences such as phantom limb pain after limb amputation are also discussed to be related to such cortical plastic changes  <cit> . hence it could be of therapeutical interest to prevent cortical plasticity, e.g. by using drugs such as memantine, which is a non-competitive antagonist of glutamate and other excitatory amino acids at the mk-801-binding site of the nmda receptor  <cit> .

here, we used the previously introduced muscle co-contraction paradigm  muscle) combined with tms mapping of the apb muscle before and after training in order to evaluate the effect of memantine on short-term motor cortex plasticity in healthy subjects, and on motor performance. previous studies generally used single dose administration of different drugs like nmda antagonists or gaba agonists in order to pharmacologically modulate cortical plasticity  <cit> . here, we were particularly interested in possible differential effects of different treatment regimens of memantine, and therefore administered placebo or memantine either as a single dosage or as an ascending dosage over  <dig> days to healthy humans in a randomised double-blinded cross over study design.

RESULTS
training effect on mapping parameters and map reproducibility
looking at the placebo sessions of all  <dig> subjects participating in the placebo-controlled experiments, we found a significant medial shift of the amplitude-weighted centre of gravity  of the motor output map of the apb muscle  after motor training. this cog shift was accompanied by a significant lowering of the motor threshold . other mapping parameters like the x coordinate of the cog, the area of the map, the number of hotspots of the map, the mean mep amplitude and the sum of amplitudes  of the map did not change significantly during training.

comparing the tms mappings before motor training in the individual subjects between memantine and placebo sessions, there was no significant difference in one of the mapping parameters, indicating a high reproducibility of the mapping procedure.

memantine effect 
in the eight subjects who participated in this experiment, we found a significant shortening of the latency differences between the onset of the apb and deltoid muscle contraction during the course of the motor training as revealed by anova for repeated measurements  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; fig. 1a). memantine did not affect this training effect, as shown by the non-significant influence of the factor "drug"  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), and by the non-significant interaction between both factors  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

memantine serum levels, which were assessed in seven subjects, reached a plateau about  <dig> hours after drug intake and remained almost stable during the following  <dig> hours . among all subjects, the highest memantine serum level that was reached was  <dig>  ng/ml of memantine free base . mean memantine serum level  <dig> hours after drug intake  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml.

anova revealed a significant lowering of mt after training  =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  for the factor "training"), but without significant influence of the factor "drug"  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), and without significant interaction between both factors  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). for other mapping parameters, no significant influence of the factors "training" or "drug", and no significant interaction between both factors was detected.

memantine effect 
similar to the results of the single dosage session, we found a significant shortening of the latency differences between the onset of the apb and deltoid muscle contraction during training as revealed by anova for repeated measurements  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; fig. 1b) in the seven subjects who participated in this experiment. again, memantine did not affect this training effect, as shown by the non-significant influence of the factor "drug"  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), and by the non-significant interaction between both factors  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

mean serum level in the memantine session was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml of memantine free base, with a maximum of  <dig>  ng/ml in one subject.

regarding the y coordinate of the cog, there was a medial shift of the y coordinate under placebo , whereas under memantine a slight lateral shift was observed . anova revealed a significant interaction of the factors "training" and "drug"  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), whereas the factors "training"  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and "drug"  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) alone did not influence the y coordinate, indicating a significant difference between the shifts of the y coordinate under the different experimental conditions . for other mapping parameters, no significant influence of the factors "training" or "drug", and no significant interaction between both factors was found.

in order to assess the effect of memantine alone on mapping parameters, without motor training, we additionally compared baseline tms maps in the placebo and in the memantine condition using student's paired t-test. for none of the mapping parameters, including the y-coordinate of the cog , a significant difference could be observed between the baseline maps , indicating that memantine alone had no effect on the mapping parameters.

influence of memantine serum levels
in order to determine whether the differential effect of memantine in the two experiments might be more related to the different serum levels or to the repeated dosage, we administered a low dosage of memantine  over  <dig> days in  <dig> additional healthy subjects. mean memantine serum level in this control experiment was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml of memantine free base, with a maximum of  <dig>  ng/ml in one subject, and therefore similar to the mean memantine level in the single dosage experiment. the training effect on motor performance was comparable to the other two experiments, with a significant shortening of the latency differences between the onset of the apb and deltoid muscle contraction during training as revealed by anova for repeated measurements  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). however, for none of the mapping parameters, a significant pre-post difference could be observed after motor training . similarly to the ascending dosage experiment, the y co-ordinate of the cog showed a tendency rather to a lateral than to a medial shift, indicating an effective prevention of training-induced cortical plastic changes.

looking separately at the different experiments, no significant individual correlation was found between memantine serum levels and the pre-post differences of one of the mapping parameters. with the data of the memantine conditions of all experiments pooled together, also no significant correlation with the memantine serum level was detected, neither for the pre-post difference of the y coordinate , nor for one of the other mapping parameters.

relationship between motor performance and tms mapping
for none of the pre-post differences of the mapping parameters, a significant correlation to the improvement of the motor performance could be observed.

discussion
the main finding of this study is that the repetitive performance of a motor task consisting of a synchronised contraction of the apb and deltoid muscle in the placebo condition leads to a directional shift of the cog of the motor output map of the apb muscle towards the more medial representation of the co-contracted muscle, and that this medial shift is blocked by memantine administered over a period of  <dig> days, but not by a single dose of memantine.

our results confirm the results of previous studies, which demonstrated a similar directional shift by means of tms mapping using the same motor training paradigm  <cit> . in addition, a training induced reduction of motor threshold was observed, which did not differ between placebo and memantine sessions. this lack of influence of memantine on motor threshold is in line with previous findings, suggesting that motor threshold mainly reflects the excitability of the neuronal membrane, and therefore can be influenced by drugs that block voltage-gated sodium channels like lamotrigine or phenytoin  <cit> , whereas drugs that influence synaptic transmission like memantine have little influence  <cit> .

changes of motor threshold and area may be simply due to changes of local motor excitability and not necessarily linked to "true" plasticity in the underlying networks  <cit> . in contrast, the shift of the cog of the motor output map must be considered as a marker for organisational changes in the representation of movements within the primary motor cortex, and therefore as a correlate of "true" motor cortex plasticity  <cit> . in previous studies, it has been extensively demonstrated that drugs affecting cortical excitability  are not able to induce "true" cortical plasticity on their own, suggesting that cortical excitability changes might constitute a necessary, but not sufficient factor in the induction of cortical plasticity  <cit> . thus it is not conceivable that memantine, which is also known to affect motor cortex excitability  <cit> , induces a  directional shift of the cog on its own, and therefore only masks the training induced medial shift of the cog. such an effect of memantine alone on the cog could additionally be excluded by comparing the baseline maps obtained prior to the motor learning with placebo and memantine in the ascending dosage experiment, which did not significantly differ from each other. our results therefore strongly suggest that memantine is able to block training-induced motor cortex plasticity.

similar use-dependent alterations of movement representations were observed in the primary motor cortex of adult squirrel monkeys by nudo et al.  <cit> . they discovered that after training there was an area expansion of dual-response representations, i.e., cortical sectors over which stimulation produced movements over two or more joints. this may explain the shift of the apb motor output map towards the representation of the co-contracted deltoid muscle in our study. this representational shift can be referred to a principle presented by hebb, who suggested that individual neurons could participate in different cell assemblies and be involved in multiple functions and representations  <cit> . the synchronisation or pairing of impulses would then lead to an increase of the excitability of specific neuronal populations, and to a strengthening of the efficacy of their synaptic pathways  <cit> . this strengthening of synaptic efficacy would involve ltp-like mechanisms, and require the activation of nmda receptors  <cit> . the fact that the nmda antagonist memantine was able to prevent cortical plasticity supports this view and confirms previous findings  <cit> .

a significant effect of memantine on motor cortex plasticity could be observed in the ascending dosage experiment, whereas the single dosage experiment failed to show a significant difference between memantine and placebo. since memantine serum levels were markedly higher in this group, we cannot completely rule out that the differential effects of the two administration regimens are linked to these differences in the serum levels. however, in an additional control experiment, an effective blockade of training-induced cortical plasticity was also reached by a repeated administration of a low memantine dosage, with memantine serum levels comparable to those measured after administration of a higher single dosage. besides, correlation analysis failed to detect a linear correlation between memantine serum levels and cog shifts in individual subjects. these additional findings suggest that the repeated administration of memantine over  <dig> days was more important for the blocking effect than the memantine serum levels. in previous studies, it has been demonstrated that after subchronic nmda receptor blockade over seven days, regulatory mechanisms occur at a cellular level, including a down-regulation of cortical nmda receptors due to a reduction of the glutamate binding site  <cit> . such mechanisms might also have occurred in our study after  <dig> days of memantine administration in both the ascending dosage experiment and the control experiment using a repeated low dosage, and therefore have contributed to the effective blockade of training-induced cortical plasticity regardless of memantine serum levels.

during one hour of training, a significant improvement was observed in motor performance, which was not affected by memantine administration, neither in the single dosage nor in the ascending dosage experiment. there was also no significant correlation between the performance improvement and the changes of one of the mapping parameters. this lack of correlation also corresponds to the results reported in previous studies  <cit> , which did not reveal a correlation between the improvement of motor performance and the shift of the motor output map. it supports the view that the repetition of a synchronised movement is more important for the induction of cortical plasticity than the improvement of the motor performance.

CONCLUSIONS
previous clinical studies, which used the nmda antagonist memantine to treat patients e.g. with chronic phantom limb pain, failed to prove any therapeutic effect of memantine in these patients  <cit> . this might be due to the fact that pain-related reorganisation in these chronic patients was already fixed and based on structural changes, hence no longer dependent on nmda receptor activation. however, from a theoretical point of view, preventing cortical plasticity by blocking nmda receptors might be a promising clinical approach for the prevention of phantom limb pain if the nmda antagonist is administered before amputation. the present study suggests that memantine is a drug that could be effective for this purpose, and should be evaluated in further clinical studies. it also emphasizes the importance of an adequate dosage regime, since it would be probably ineffective if administered as a single dosage. repeated administration seems to be more important than the reached serum levels, possibly allowing the use of lower dosages which are better tolerated.
