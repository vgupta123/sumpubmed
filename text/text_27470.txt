BACKGROUND
angiosperm mitochondrial genomes range from  <dig>  to more than  <dig>  million bp. these large size differences are due to highly variable intergenic regions that lie between a relatively conserved set of protein coding genes
 <cit> . inter-species comparisons of mitogenomes suggest they undergo frequent inter- and intra-molecular recombination and tend to acquire both chloroplast and nuclear genetic material
 <cit> . in addition, short degenerate repeats are common between genes in cucurbit mtdna
 <cit> . another contributing force to the chimeric nature of plant mitochondrial genomes is their ability to readily uptake dna through horizontal gene transfer. richardson and palmer
 <cit>  showed that the mitochondria of the dicot amborella trichopoda contained sequences homologous to different species’ mitogenomes. with their highly recombinant dna, propensity for genomic double strand breakage, and perpetual ability to undergo fusion and fission, these organelles set themselves apart from the rest of the cell regarding potential for genomic diversity
 <cit> .

the frequent recombination and transfer events have not only expanded the intergenic regions, but also produce possible protein-coding open reading frames  in some species. small orfs can comprise a significant amount of the mitogenome; for example there are  <dig> poorly characterized small orfs in the tobacco mitogenome, compared to  <dig> genes with identifiable functions
 <cit> . almost all of these are uncharacterized in tobacco, but some homologous sequences have been linked to cytoplasmic male sterility  in other species
 <cit> . orfs  <dig> and  <dig> in sorghum have been shown to control cms
 <cit>  and are conserved among the mitogenomes of oryza and triticum <cit> . these mitogenomic orfs may also indirectly modulate rna steady-state levels since cytoplasmic message background affects rna degradation
 <cit> .

the plant mitogenome is transcribed by phage-type  nuclear-encoded rna polymerase 
 <cit> . in eudicots, two rnaps localize to mitochondria: rpotm, which exclusively localizes to the mitochondria, and rpotmp, which localizes to both mitochondria and plastids
 <cit> . rpotm is probably the primary polymerase and rpotmp transcribes mitochondrial genes early in development
 <cit> . plant mitochondrial genes often possess multiple promoters consisting of core tetranucleotides crta, atta, and rgta that are part of a nonanucleotide conserved sequence, crtaagaga, and an at-rich region upstream from the start site
 <cit> . as more mitogenomic data has become available, genes without obvious promoter motifs and possible promoter sequences within intergenic regions have been discovered. there are two different descriptions of plant mitochondrial transcription that are linked to polymerase type. kuhn et al.
 <cit>  have shown that rpotmp is gene specific rather than promoter specific. this opens the possibility of cis-acting elements specifically directing transcription. other studies have observed non-specific transcription of the intergenic regions resulting in large quantities of “junk” transcripts
 <cit> . this finding, coupled with an observation of loosely controlled transcription termination—which produces long run-on rnas
 <cit> —suggests indiscriminate low-scale expression of much of the mitogenome, most likely by the rpotm polymerase
 <cit> .

these long transcripts undergo a series of processing events to produce functional transcripts
 <cit> . transcript editing is a ubiquitous and widely encountered processing event in plant mitochondria. every protein-coding sequence in a mitogenome is likely to be edited; overall editing in angiosperms are estimated to occur at about  <dig> sites per genome
 <cit>  with a range from  <dig> in silene noctiflora <cit> , to  <dig> in date palm
 <cit> . almost all mitochondrial editing is performed through the process of cytosine to uracil conversion 
 <cit> . editing has been linked to generating start and stop codons, enabling protein function by altering amino acid content, and restoring fertility in cases of cytoplasmic male sterility 
 <cit> . lu and hanson
 <cit>  demonstrated that protein products from the atp <dig> gene in petunia were made exclusively from completely edited transcripts within the mitochondria. alternately, polypeptides from unedited or partially edited transcripts accumulate in zea mays <cit> . the consequences of this are still under investigation, but from a gene regulation perspective, partially edited transcripts can potentially provide a variety of gene products from a single coding region
 <cit> .

in this study, deep sequencing was used to assemble the tobacco mitochondrial transcriptome. this enabled the determination of mono- and polycistronic transcripts, identification of expressed uncharacterized orfs, and a whole transcriptome level estimate of editing sites. we found nine monocistronic and sixteen polycistronic transcripts. eighteen uncharacterized orfs were transcribed, eleven of which were found to be polysome associated. six hundred and thirty five potential edits were found with  <dig> occurring within protein coding genes.

RESULTS
deep sequencing and alignment of the tobacco mitochondrial transcriptome
total rna from tobacco leaves collected from six plants was sequenced in a single illumina run and aligned to the tobacco mitochondrial genome as deposited in genbank , including repeated regions.  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average length of 100nt aligned to the mitogenome and the resulting depth of coverage  chart revealed discrete regions with moderate to high doc separated by spans of very low to non-existent coverage . the low coverage regions made up the majority of the mitogenome, with  <dig> % having a doc below  <dig>   <dig> % below  <dig>  and 36% below  <dig>  the areas with the highest depth of coverage  were associated with protein-coding regions and ribosomal rna genes despite having purposefully reduced rrna content as part of the sequencing library preparation . four high doc areas with no apparent coding regions were also observed -  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig> - <dig> ,  <dig>  -  <dig>  and an area containing orf101d and orf111c from base  <dig>  -  <dig> . all have homologous regions in the chloroplast genome and the high doc very likely represented alignment of both mitochondrial and chloroplast transcripts since total rna was sequenced. trnas generally had low yet variable doc’s ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> .
 <cit> . b – higher-resolution view of the first  <dig>  bp of the mitogenome. the depth-of-coverage chart was generated using lasergene’s seqman pro v.  <dig>  protein-coding genes  and open reading frames  were manually placed below each area based on a finer nucleotide map. arrows represent the predicted transcription direction for each transcribed area.

the alignment of protein-coding regions with the doc chart suggests nine are produced as monocistronic transcripts . these include six complete coding regions  and three exons . the remaining coding regions appear to be transcribed as polycistronic units.

two genes, cox <dig> and atp <dig>  exhibited a precipitous drop of doc in the middle of these coding regions. these were considered possible uncharacterized transcript processing events so end-point pcr and rt-pcr were performed on dna and rna, respectively. both pcr and rt-pcr reactions yielded amplicons of equal size, consistent with the published genome annotation . this suggests the low doc in these two genes does not indicate a processing event but is instead a technical inconsistency

rna edit sites
potential c→u edit sites were identified in the transcriptome assembly by comparing rna reads to the published mitogenome sequences . edit sites were chosen if the doc was > <dig> and the rna edit percentage less than 100%; nucleotides with a 100% change rate between rna and the genome sequence were considered snps. this methodology identified 540c→u edit sites across the entire mitogenome . when compared to previously identified edit sites , this methodology failed to recognize  <dig> pies but found  <dig> potential new sites. combined, pies and new sites equaled  <dig> total edit sites. a supermajority of the sites,  <dig>  were in protein-coding regions and included every identifiable protein-encoding transcript plus five transcribed orfs. only two exons, rpl2_exon <dig> and rps3_exon <dig>  did not have potential edits. among the  <dig> newly identified edit sites,  <dig> were found in coding regions,  <dig> in trnas, and  <dig> in intergenic regions. forty three of the intergenic edits were in 5′ and 3′ utrs,  <dig> in intergenic regions of polycistronic transcripts, and  <dig> in regions that were not coding regions or linked to any identifiable transcript .

orf steady state rna abundance analysis
there are  <dig> predicted but uncharacterized orfs in the tobacco mitogenome annotation
 <cit> . all uncharacterized orfs in the published mitogenome annotation were compared to the doc chart generated in this study and a number of them occurred in regions where doc was above background. since transcription could signify importance, all orf’s with a doc > <dig> that did not overlap an identifiable protein-coding region were chosen for further analysis .

location of start and stop codons refer to genbank accession nc_ <dig> . peak doc refers to the approximate highest depth of coverage noted for that transcript. edit sites are the number of possible c→u edits found within the coding regions.

deep-sequencing results were confirmed with qrt-pcr analysis of three biological replicates  and mann–whitney non-parametric analysis was used to determine significant differences. for all qrt-pcr experiments, the cox <dig> mitochondrial protein-coding gene was used as a positive control and for normalization. background was measured from the orf <dig> region, which had a doc below  <dig> and qrt-pcr copy number estimates well below transcribed regions.

leaf, root, and whole-flower rna samples were used to compare and contrast orf expression. qrt-pcr results suggested that steady-state levels of the  <dig> open reading frame transcripts were highest in roots, followed by leaves, then flowers . in leaves and roots, all orf transcripts were present at levels above background, which confirmed the rna-seq results. in flowers, only  <dig> of the orfs were significantly higher than the measured background. the most abundant orf transcripts in all three organs were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 
 <cit> . all values were normalized to cox <dig> abundance as a control. dna contamination was estimated by rt minus controls and calculated values were subtracted from the measured transcript abundance.

polysome analysis of open reading frames
all the confirmed transcribed orfs were subjected to polysomal analysis to test for evidence of translation. cox <dig> was used as a positive control and orf <dig> to measure background. cox <dig> was also quantified in edta-treated extracts as a negative control. rna in polysomal pellets and supernatants from three biological replicates were purified and measured by qrt-pcr and mann–whitney non-parametric analysis was used to determine significant differences. orfs <dig>  265/atp <dig>  25/atp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  166b, and 159b/rpl <dig> were found in polysomal pellets at significantly higher amounts than background . all but one  was successfully detected in the supernatant at levels significantly higher than background.

orf homologies
translations of the eleven polysome-associated orfs were screened using genbank  and sol genomics network  to see if any encode identifiable proteins found in other mitochondrial genomes. orfs  <dig> and 159b encode putative full-length rpl <dig> proteins, orf <dig> encodes a full-length mitochondrial rps <dig>  orf <dig> encodes a full-length atp <dig> coding region, and orf265b is atp <dig>  orfs <dig>   <dig>  and 166b do not encode identifiable proteins. orfs <dig> and  <dig> match uncharacterized nuclear genes from nicotiana benthamiana. ten of the orfs were found in the mitochondrial genomes of other genera; only orf <dig> was unique to nicotiana.

discussion
the tobacco mitochondrial transcriptome
deep sequencing of the tobacco mitochondrial transcriptome detected multiple mono- and polycistronic transcripts with relatively long 3′ and 5′ utrs. the most highly transcribed regions contained protein-coding regions, and the length and content of the transcripts suggested extensive post-transcriptional processing takes place. it has been suggested that mitochondrial genes between  <dig>  and  <dig>  nucleotides apart will most likely be transcribed as a cluster
 <cit>  which are then processed and edited to form translatable mrnas. pre-mrna maturation takes place in the matrix with 5′ end modification occurring through endonuclease activity or, at times, the pre-mrna strand does not need 5′ processing; the 5′ end is simply the beginning of the reading frame
 <cit> . the 3′ processing is much more nebulous in nature, whereas some of the transcripts have been proposed to be terminated with the help of mitochondrial transcription termination factors , other strands simply run on well past the end of the reading frame— the latter situation suggests that transcription termination in plant mitochondria is not critically important
 <cit> . nevertheless, the 3′ end is still important in protecting the rna from exonuclease activity, as local cis-acting elements aid in step loop formation
 <cit> .

in our analysis, intron and exon steady state abundance were generally distinguishable with exonic doc much higher than intronic, suggesting that introns are degraded after removal. the intergenic regions were mostly non/low-transcribed, although there were some regions with high doc. some of these had orfs predicted in the initial tobacco mitogenome annotation.

our observations confirm that long mitochondrial transcripts are produced, but these transcripts primarily contained protein-coding regions. more than 57% of the transcriptome had a doc below  <dig> and protein-coding regions were clearly distinguishable from intergenic spaces. this suggests transcription was focused on protein-coding regions and that transcription is only occurring at high rates in specific areas. plant mitochondrial gene expression is portrayed as a relaxed and inefficient coordination of two phage-type rna polymerases 
 <cit> . this is based on the placement of promoters that have been found upstream of protein coding genes as well as scattered throughout intergenic regions
 <cit> . the overall result is long run-on transcripts found throughout plant mitochondrial transcriptomes and large quantities of cryptic transcripts from intergenic regions
 <cit> . alternatively, mitochondrial transcription rates have been shown to vary considerably between different genes – most likely due to different promoter strengths and unique stoichiometric needs of each gene
 <cit> .

mitogenome edit sites
transcriptome analysis revealed 540c→u edits in the tobacco mitochondrial transcriptome which, if combined with pies, gives  <dig> total edit sites with  <dig> in coding regions. this observation is consistent with estimates from other higher plant mitochondria, where an average of  <dig> edit sites per mitogenome has been suggested, with most of those edits occurring in coding regions
 <cit> . in our analysis, transcriptome assembly accompanied by the snp function in the assembly package failed to recognize  <dig> of the previously reported sites but identified  <dig> edit sites unreported in previous analyses .

the sites missed in the transcriptome analysis were manually inspected and all appear to be edited according to the alignment, although some at very low rates . we suspect these sites were not identified by the snp function because they were in areas with erroneously low mid-transcript doc’s and/or the percentage of edited nucleotides was much lower than expected based on other sites .

most of the  <dig> newly identified edit sites were not in coding regions revealing a larger proportion of intergenic edit sites than identified in previous screens. very few instances of editing in non-coding regions exist. in arabidopsis thaliana  <dig> of  <dig> sites are reported outside of coding regions
 <cit>  and in tobacco, one site had been identified . a definitive reason to edit non-coding regions is elusive, but some have been linked to splicing
 <cit> . most of the non-coding region editing sites found in this study were in utr regions suggesting they may be necessary for processing or translation. others found in intron regions could be a prerequisite for splicing. it is also possible that some of these are unnecessary and indicate superfluous editing similar to the silent editing reported in some third codon positions
 <cit> .

expression of mitogenomic open reading frames
in this study,  <dig> uncharacterized open reading frames were found in transcribed regions and then confirmed with qrt-pcr. polysome analysis showed  <dig> transcripts from those orf’s were attached to ribosomes. two, orfs <dig> and 265b are homologous to atp <dig> and  <dig>  have been linked to cytoplasmic male sterility in sorghum
 <cit> , and are found in at least two other mitogenomes
 <cit> . three others encode putative full-length proteins. orf159b was recently characterized as rpl <dig> in angiosperm mitochondria, including n. tabacum <cit> . orf <dig> also appears to encode a near full length rpl <dig> protein. the role of orf <dig> as a second truncated rpl <dig> is unknown. orf <dig> encodes a mitochondrial rps <dig> protein. rps <dig> has not been defined in tobacco, but has been identified in the mitogenome other plants such as wheat and primrose
 <cit> . five orfs — <dig>   <dig>  166b,  <dig>  and  <dig> do not encode identifiable proteins but are transcribed and polysome associated.

there are conflicting hypotheses regarding the possible benefit mitochondrial open reading frames provide. some suggest their origin through recombination events create a burden on the organelle’s rna processing systems
 <cit>  which would suggest selection against their presence. beaudet et al.
 <cit>  found some mitogenomic orfs were mobile elements specializing in horizontal gene transfer; these were responsible for making chimeric versions of existing mitochondrial genes suggesting they benefit the organelle. our data suggests they are not merely present but some are also transcribed and possibly translated.

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome analysis of the tobacco mitogenome demonstrated that the chromosome is transcribed as discrete mono- and poly-cistronic transcripts with low- or non-transcribed intervening sequences. this confirms previous observations and suggestions of multiple promoter sites throughout the mitogenome. an inventory of rna edit sites shows that widespread editing is not limited to coding regions in the tobacco mito-transcriptome. this suggests editing enzymes do not discriminate between coding and non-coding rna. some plant mitochondrial genomes have numerous uncharacterized orfs that may be functional genes or recombinational remnants. the data presented in this study show that  <dig> of the  <dig> poorly characterized orfs in the tobacco mitogenome are transcribed and  <dig> are polysome associated. this suggests that some of these produce functional proteins.
