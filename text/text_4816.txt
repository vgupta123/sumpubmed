BACKGROUND
medicago truncatula gaertn. , native to the mediterranean region, is a self-regenerating annual pasture species grown on over  <dig>  million hectares in the dryland cereal/livestock zones in southern australia  <cit> . m. truncatula is adapted to a wide range of soils from sandy loams to clays and prefers neutral to alkaline soils  >  <dig> ). when grown in rotation with cereal crops their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen contributes significantly to the nitrogen balance of following crops. this lessens the need for inorganic nitrogen fertilisers and hence increases economic returns to producers and benefits the environment  <cit> . additionally as a non-host of many important cereal diseases, they are able to provide a valuable disease-break from pathogens such as take-all , crown rot  and cereal cyst nematode   <cit> . together with lotus japonicus, m. truncatula is also a model organism for legume biology with an international consortium providing researchers with numerous genetic resources including two drafts of the sequenced genome and genetic maps . its relatively small genome size  and high levels of synteny to major crop legumes such as pea  and alfalfa   <cit>  make it an ideal system to conduct molecular genetics analyses on biotic and abiotic stresses affecting legumes.

a major problem facing m. truncatula and other legumes in arid world regions such as southern australia, northern africa, and the mediterranean is the presence of phytotoxic levels of boron  in the soil which can significantly impact on seed yield and quality  <cit> . because remediation of b-toxic soils is impractical  <cit> , investigators have looked to improve plant tolerance to b. in cereal crop species such as wheat and barley, genetic variation for b tolerance has led to the identification of quantitative trait loci  linked to b toxicity tolerance  <cit> , and more recently to the genes underlying these qtl  <cit> . this has facilitated the development of closely linked molecular markers that can be used in breeding programs to improve the tolerance of wheat and barley grown in areas where b toxicity is a problem. in m. truncatula, genetic variation for b toxicity tolerance among different cultivars had earlier been reported  <cit>  but so far has not been exploited to identify the gene or genetic regions controlling this trait.

recent studies in barley and arabidopsis offer clues as to what genes may control b toxicity tolerance in m. truncatula. these studies have implicated the involvement of genes encoding one of two types of proteins involved in b uptake and translocation:  efflux-type b transporters or  members of the major intrinsic protein  family. the first efflux-type b transporter gene identified was the arabidopsis atbor <dig> gene  <cit> . although atbor <dig> conferred tolerance to plants under b deficient conditions, its homologue in barley, hvbot <dig> , enabled plants to tolerate high levels of b  <cit> . the over-expression of an atbor <dig> paralog, atbor <dig>  in transgenic arabidopsis plants also increased their tolerance to high b levels  <cit> . atnip5; <dig> was the first b transporter gene identified that encodes a member of the mip family  <cit> . mips, also known as aquaporins, are channels for water and/or small non-charged molecules  <cit>  and are comprised of four subfamilies; the nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins , the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , the tonoplast intrinsic proteins , and the small basic intrinsic proteins . atnip5; <dig> encodes a nip subfamily member, and like atbor <dig>  was shown to be associated with b deficiency tolerance, with atnip5; <dig> functioning as a boric acid channel required for the efficient uptake of b in roots  <cit> . in contrast, a recently discovered nip gene in barley, hvnip2; <dig>  was found to be an important determinant of b toxicity tolerance  <cit> , with the authors proposing that b toxicity tolerance is mediated by reduced expression of hvnip2; <dig> to limit b uptake as well as by increased expression of hvbot <dig> to remove b from roots and sensitive tissues. a mip subfamily member, attip5; <dig> was also recently described conferring tolerance to b toxicity when over-expressed in transgenic arabidopsis plants  <cit> .

in this study, a candidate gene approach combined with population genetics and phenotypic analysis was used to determine the molecular basis of b tolerance in m. truncatula. we report the identification of a homologous atnip5; <dig> gene, mtnip <dig>  in m. truncatula associated with b toxicity tolerance. a gene-based marker derived from mtnip <dig>  named mtbtol- <dig>  and further markers co-segregated with b toxicity tolerance in two f <dig> populations. in addition, gene expression of mtnip <dig> was up-regulated in the leaves of respective b-tolerant parental lines. this information warrants further characterisation of mtnip <dig> as a candidate gene for b tolerance and provides gene-based markers as molecular tools to introgress and maintain the tolerance trait in medicago breeding programs.

RESULTS
segregation analysis
the inheritance results of the phenotypic data are presented in table  <dig>  the segregation ratio for the b toxicity tolerance trait has a significant fit  to the expected 3: <dig>  ratio for a single dominant locus, which is true for both f <dig> populations. f <dig> plants of the population tap × paraggio  had leaf symptom scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  whereas in tap × caliph the scores ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  relative to these symptom ranges in txp and txc, plants with a score of  <dig> and  <dig> in txp and a score of  <dig> to  <dig> in txc were considered as b tolerant.

b accumulation in root and leaf tissue
initially, subsets of  <dig> and  <dig> f <dig> lines from the txp and txc populations, respectively, were selected to screen for potential molecular markers. the subsets consisted of lines that were phenotyped after three weeks of high b treatment and had clear tolerant  or intolerant  scores. icp analysis was used to  quantify the amount of b accumulating in the leaf, and  verify the correlation between b levels and phenotypic scores. additional icp analysis was carried out on leaves and roots of the three parental lines to quantify the b distribution in tolerant and intolerant plants. the results are summarised in figure  <dig>  in the txp subset, the mean b concentration in leaves sampled from b-tolerant and -intolerant f <dig> lines was  <dig> mg/kg  and  <dig> mg/kg , respectively. in the txc subset the mean b concentration was  <dig> mg/kg  and  <dig> mg/kg . the leaves of parental lines had mean b concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mg/kg. in contrast to the mean b concentrations in the leaves, with tolerant lines accumulating less than half the amount of b compared to the intolerant lines, mean b concentrations in the roots did not differ significantly,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/kg.

biomass production and boron tolerance
breeding for b tolerance aims at maintaining yield under high b concentrations. as a proxy for the agronomic value of the b tolerance trait in pasture legumes, plant biomass or dry matter production  was measured. the average dm production of the tolerant f <dig> plants and their tolerant parent, caliph, was not significantly different,  <dig>  g versus  <dig>  g, respectively. in contrast, the average dm of the intolerant f <dig> lines was significantly higher than that of the intolerant parent tap,  <dig>  g versus  <dig>  g, respectively . the dm and symptom scores were highly correlated with a coefficient of − <dig>   indicating that the observed differences in biomass production are due to the b tolerance trait being present or absent in the individual f <dig> plants. with each increase in visual symptom score dm was reduced by approximately one gram.

development of molecular markers for b toxicity tolerance
the atbor <dig> and atnip5; <dig> cdna sequences  and their respective predicted protein sequences  were used to query the m. truncatula pseudomolecule database  available at the m. truncatula hapmap project website . the best atbor <dig> homologue, identified on chromosome  <dig>  encodes a predicted protein, which shares 78% amino acid  sequence identity with atbor <dig>  we developed a gene based caps marker for this gene but found no linkage between this boron transporter gene and b tolerance in either of the txp or txc f <dig> subsets.

four medicago database matches to atnip5; <dig> were identified on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . both chromosome  <dig> candidates  encode exactly the same predicted protein, which shares 69% sequence identity with atnip5; <dig>  whereas the chromosome  <dig> candidates encode different predicted proteins with 60%  and 54%  identity to atnip5; <dig>  respectively. the medtr4g <dig>  protein product corresponds to the aquaporin mtnip <dig>  identified  <cit>  and its corresponding gene is referred to as mtnip <dig>  the two bacs on each chromosome were adjacent to one another and the physical distance between candidate genes was small – approximately  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb for chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> candidates, respectively. two flanking ssr markers  located within  <dig> kb of the chromosome  <dig> candidate genes showed polymorphisms between tap and paraggio but proved not to be linked to b tolerance in the subset of f <dig> lines tested. thus, like the atbor <dig> homologue on chromosome  <dig>  the chromosome  <dig> candidate genes were ruled out from further analysis. in contrast, ssr markers flanking the nip candidate genes on chromosome  <dig> showed strong linkage with the b tolerance phenotype. the ssr markers mtic <dig>  h2_13f22h, h2_6e22a, h2_21b19a and 001d <dig>  which flank a  <dig> kb interval were polymorphic in either one or both f <dig> populations and explained 94% to 96% of the phenotypic variation . amongst these ssrs, the markers which were more distant from the  <dig> kb nip gene cluster were less closely linked to the tolerance phenotype within the segregating populations . together with the segregation ratio characteristic of a single dominant locus, the strong linkage of these ssr makers to the tolerant phenotypes indicated that the trait-defining gene reside at this  <dig> kb nip gene locus.

most closely linked markers are in bold font. * n = 200; ** n = 36; n.a., not applicable; n.p., not polymorphic.

to dissect this locus, we derived caps markers from or closer to the nip genes themselves. the m. truncatula hapmap project gene annotations revealed that the candidate atnip5; <dig> homologue on bac ac <dig> has a potential splice variant, with both gene products  predicted to encode nips. likewise, the second chromosome  <dig> candidate on bac ac <dig>  is also predicted to encode a nip, with the  <dig> kb genomic region in between the two genes  containing three more potential nip genes . therefore, according to the gene annotations, the locus as a whole contains up to five predicted nip genes encoding six gene products potentially involved in controlling b toxicity tolerance. three caps markers, named mtbtol- <dig>  mtbtol- <dig> and mtbtol- <dig>  were developed that were polymorphic in both txp  and txc  populations  within this region and explained 96% and 94% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. mtbtol- <dig> is specific to the first candidate atnip5; <dig> homologue, medtr4g <dig> / <dig> , mtbtol- <dig> is specific to the medtr4g <dig>  gene which is situated  <dig> kb away from the second candidate atnip5; <dig> homologue, medtr4g <dig> , and mtbtol- <dig> is specific to the medtr4g <dig>  gene. it was not possible to design a gene specific marker for medtr4g <dig>  due to its close similarity with the medtr4g <dig> / <dig>  gene.

nip gene expression
we used q-pcr to investigate the expression profiles of the nip genes in roots and shoots of the three parental lines over a  <dig> h period following excess b treatment. due to the high level of coding sequence similarity between the medtr4g <dig> / <dig> / <dig>  gene products, it was only possible to design gene specific primers for medtr4g <dig>  and the splice variant medtr4g <dig> . design of gene specific primers was also hindered by the absence of information related to the untranslated regions of these gene sequences. hence, a third primer pair, specific to all three genes, was designed to generate a cumulative expression profile of b transporter candidates. each of the primer pairs amplified the expected sized fragment when genomic dna was used as template, however, only the primer pair specific for all three gene products amplified clear fragments of expected size from the cdnas of the time course experiment. two medtr4g <dig>  specific primer pairs with different annealing positions in the gene amplified no product at all whereas the medtr4g <dig>  specific primers yielded a small amount of expected product corresponding to < <dig> copies/μl in the leaf and root tissue examined, which is at the very limit of detection for q-pcr. therefore, by exclusion, the cumulative expression profile that was generated for all three genes was in fact presumed to represent one, medtr4g <dig> .

the expression profile for medtr <dig>  showed that the gene is constitutively expressed in the leaves, with approximately  <dig> times more transcripts present in both b-tolerant lines compared to the intolerant line . in roots, the expression was equally low and non-differential in all three genotypes irrespective of their b tolerance phenotype. the expression level in the roots was comparable with the leaf expression of the intolerant line tap . the stronger gene expression of medtr <dig>  in the leaves of the tolerant lines correlated with the b toxicity tolerance phenotype.

q-pcr assays were also designed to investigate the possible involvement of the other three predicted mip genes at this locus, medtr4g <dig> / <dig> / <dig> . again, the specificity of the primers was confirmed with the correct sized pcr fragment being amplified from dna template. however, none of the primer pairs amplified any product on the cdnas of the time course experiment from leaf and root tissue, suggesting no detectable expression before or after b treatment.

analysis of mtnip <dig>  gene copy number
we used southern hybridisation to determine if the presence of additional mtnip <dig> gene copies in the two b-tolerant lines could account for the increased mrna transcript levels observed for this gene in the leaves. as it was not possible to design a specific hybridisation probe for medtr4g <dig>   due to the high level of homology it shares with medtr4g <dig>  , the designed probe would detect both genes. the resulting hybridisation revealed the presence of two gene copies in tap  and paraggio, and one copy in caliph . thus, the observed increase in mtnip <dig> transcript levels in the leaves of the two b-tolerant lines was not associated with a higher gene copy number.

mtnip <dig> coding sequence and promoter region
the mtnip <dig> coding region was sequenced from caliph, paraggio, and tap to identify potential differences in the predicted amino acid composition of the corresponding mip protein. a  <dig> bp cdna fragment was amplified from all three genotypes. none of the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms  identified were specific to caliph/paraggio or tap . the seven snps translated into three changes among the  <dig> amino acid residues of the nip protein in the three genotypes. again, the changes were not specific to the b-tolerant genotypes .

a comparative medtr4g <dig>  promoter analysis between caliph, paraggio, and tap was also performed to search for differences which could explain the variation in transcript levels observed between the b-tolerant and -intolerant lines. sequencing of the  <dig>  kb region directly upstream of the transcription start site revealed a 99% basepair identity between the three genotypes. the differences were not specific to the intolerant or the tolerant genotypes and further work would be required to address the impact of these single and dinucleotide differences on gene expression or search for potential differences further upstream.

discussion
in this study, a candidate gene approach was used to identify the underlying genetic loci for tolerance to b toxicity in m. truncatula. similar to the recently reported identification of the genetic basis for herbicide tolerance in m. truncatula <cit> , we utilised the molecular and physiological information on b homeostasis first reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . although the corresponding proteins of the arabidopsis b transporter /channel genes atbor <dig> and atnip5; <dig> are associated with the efficient transport of b across the plasma membrane under b deficiency  <cit> , similar proteins in barley were shown to aid the plant in conditions of b excess  <cit> . therefore, it was hypothesised that homologous genes in m. truncatula of atnip5; <dig> and atbor <dig> could also play a role in supporting plants to tolerate high levels of b in the soil.

genetic variation for b toxicity tolerance was identified in the m. truncatula lines paraggio and caliph  and tap . paraggio and caliph were each crossed with tap to generate two f <dig> populations segregating for b tolerance. the phenotypic segregation of the b tolerance trait was measured in over  <dig> individuals for each of the f <dig> populations and agreed with a single dominant locus that might host a single or several closely linked tolerance genes. a very close correlation between the visual symptom scores on individual plants and their biomass production was also evident suggesting b uptake as the direct and major cause of reduced plant growth and validating the symptom scores as a valid tool to estimate plant performance. all tolerant plants analysed showed a reduced  level of b in their leaf tissue compared to intolerant lines implying an exclusion mechanism being the underlying b tolerance mechanism in this pasture legume. an exclusion mechanism was also proposed in barley where b-tolerant cultivars showed decreased b concentrations in their leaves compared to intolerant cultivars  <cit> .

with the aid of the 2nd draft  of the sequenced m. truncatula genome, candidate atnip5; <dig> and atbor <dig> homologues were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  a subset of highly b-tolerant and -intolerant lines from the two segregating f <dig> populations was used initially for genotyping to establish linkage between the b-tolerant phenotype and ssr markers located close to the homologous bor and nip genes on all three chromosomes. only ssr markers located near two candidate atnip5; <dig> homologues, separated by only  <dig> kb, on chromosome  <dig> showed linkages of approximately 95% to the tolerance trait in both f <dig> populations. the strong linkage was then upheld across  <dig> individual f <dig> lines from the tap x paraggio cross which further supported that the corresponding genetic region was associated with b toxicity tolerance. we referred to one of these candidate genes as mtnip <dig> and the predicted protein as mtnip <dig>  which was one of six aquaporins first identified in m. truncatula <cit> . the other predicted gene was referred to as mtnip <dig> 

although both corresponding proteins encoded by mtnip <dig> and mtnip <dig> confirmed good amino acid sequence similarity to atnip5; <dig>  they both showed a greater level of amino acid sequence identity to atnip6; <dig> – another mip family member and b channel identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . mtnip <dig> has 75% sequence identity to atnip6; <dig> whereas mtnip <dig> shares only 57% identity. within the  <dig> kb interval, between mtnip <dig> and mtnip <dig>  there are up to three additional predicted mip genes and a splice variant of mtnip <dig>  fine mapping this locus with three caps markers derived from the actual mip genes themselves or sequences nearby did not improve the linkage obtained with the two most closely linked ssr markers. however, the slight decrease in linkage for flanking ssr markers either side of this locus gave a strong indication that one or a combination of the mip genes in the  <dig> kb interval were involved in regulating the transport of b in the plant. therefore, as an output of the genetic analysis we identified eight molecular markers that were closely linked to the b tolerance trait, the best of which were caps markers mtbtol- <dig>  mtbtol- <dig>  and mtbtol- <dig> and ssr markers h2_6e22a and h2_21b19a, which are all 95% linked. the observation that these markers explain 95% and not 100% of the phenotypic variation is expected considering that b-intolerant f <dig> plants still show a greater level of b tolerance, when quantified as dm production, than the intolerant parent . plant characteristics independent of b exclusion such as morphological differences e.g. a stronger vigour of caliph and paraggio over the intolerant tap mutant, are likely to account for the remaining 5% of phenotypic variation in these two populations. aside from dm production, the icp analysis clearly showed differences in the range of b levels in the leaves of the f <dig> lines from the txc compared to the txp population. these differences can again be explained by genotype-specific traits  that are inherited independently of the b exclusion locus.

as the chromosome  <dig> locus associated with mtbtol- <dig> contains up to five predicted mip genes, we tried to narrow down the association with b toxicity tolerance to individual genes by monitoring their expression in caliph, paraggio, and tap prior to and after treatment with excess b. although a specific q-pcr assay could not be designed for mtnip <dig>  by excluding the low or non-expression of its predicted splice variant and the similar gene mtnip <dig>  respectively, we deduced that mtnip <dig> was the only mip gene expressed at this locus as no expression signals were detected for the remaining three mip candidates when using alternative sets of primers. this meant that they were either not expressed, expressed at extremely low levels, or that the gene predictions were not correct and these genes were simply not there. ultimately, the presence and function of in silico predicted genes has to be confirmed through the analysis of their gene product  <cit> . most interesting was the observation that the constitutive expression of mtnip <dig> in the leaves was almost four-fold higher in both b-tolerant lines compared to the intolerant line. by contrast, there was no difference in expression levels in the roots of tolerant and intolerant lines. a similar pattern was observed with the distribution of b in the leaves and roots of the tolerant and intolerant parental lines. there was no significant difference of b in the roots but twice the b concentration in the leaves of the intolerant parent compared to that in both tolerant lines. several mechanisms of alleviating b toxicity are being discussed, including efflux from the roots, redistribution of b in the leaves and leaching of b by rain or removing b from the plant through guttation  <cit> . based on the observed b distribution in the roots and leaves we can exclude that efflux from the roots is responsible for the different levels of b tolerance in these genotypes. nevertheless, other b tolerant medic genotypes  <cit>  might well employ such a mechanism. possible mechanisms could be either the redistribution of b in the leaves from sensitive symplastic to apoplastic spaces in the leaves and subsequent leaching through rain  <cit>  and/or the removal of b via guttation  <cit> . after b treatment, mtnip <dig> expression was regulated in the leaves only, with the level of differential expression being  <dig> times higher in b-tolerant compared to intolerant lines. the fact that the two b-tolerant lines also have substantially less b in their leaves suggests that mtnip <dig> itself or homologs at the mtnip <dig> locus may function in removing b from the leaf.

southern hybridisation with an mtnip3/mtnip <dig> specific probe ruled out the possibility that additional copies of mtnip <dig> were responsible for the increased expression of this gene in the leaves of b-tolerant lines. in fact, caliph only had one gene copy as opposed to the two detected in paraggio and tap. in barley, it was shown that a b-tolerant genotype had approximately four times as many copies of the b transporter gene bot <dig> compared to a number of intolerant genotypes  <cit> , however, in medicago this does not appear to be the case for mtnip <dig> 

with mtnip <dig> not showing measurable transcript levels in roots and youngest leaves, our findings suggest that mtnip <dig> is the most promising candidate to be involved in the mechanism controlling b toxicity tolerance in m. truncatula as its expression is strongly linked with b tolerance and distribution in the plant. given that b is essential for cell wall elongation, where it is required for the cross-linking of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan ii  <cit> , the constitutive expression of mtnip <dig> in the roots and leaves is not surprising as mtnip <dig> may always be needed to give b access to sink tissues for normal plant growth. the lower constitutive and then non-differential mtnip <dig> expression observed in the roots following b treatment is consistent with what was reported for atnip6; <dig>  the arabidopsis gene most similar to mtnip <dig> <cit> . it would be interesting to know if this closest medicago match to atnip6; <dig> does share the water impermeability of the atnip6; <dig> protein  <cit> . considering that m. truncatula grows in low rainfall environments of northern africa, mediterranean europe and southern australia, a water conserving mechanism to remove excess b would be advantageous to the plant. it is likely that additional mtnip <dig> alleles, homologous or orthologous genes to the efflux transporter genes atbor <dig> <cit>  or hvbot <dig> <cit>  control b toxicity tolerance in other m. truncatula lines than the ones investigated here. the information gained in m. truncatula could also be used to facilitate the identification of genes in other pasture legumes  and also grain legumes  as recently demonstrated for alfalfa and the resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose  <cit> .

the generated molecular markers are currently being used in sardi’s pasture breeding program to confirm that b tolerance is conserved in advanced lines that also contain tolerance to the sulfonylurea family of herbicides  <cit> , which is being selected for by using the gene-specific marker cang  <cit> . these breeding aims support a crop/pasture rotation system where self-regenerating annual medics are grown in rotation with wheat and barley to fix atmospheric nitrogen to lower input costs, provide a cereal pathogen disease-break and serve as a high protein feed for livestock. at an estimated rate of approximately  <dig> kg nitrogen per tonne dm and a production of  <dig> tonnes dm per hectare, a medic crop can fix approximately  <dig> kg nitrogen per hectare  <cit> , reducing the need for expensive inorganic fertilisers and at the same time avoiding co <dig> emissions that would arise from the methane-driven fertiliser production.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a candidate gene approach was applied to establish a genetic linkage to the b toxicity tolerance trait observed in different cultivars of medicago truncatula. whereas no genetic linkage between other boron exclusion and efflux transporter genes was detected, strong linkages were evident to genetic markers flanking a cluster comprising five predicted nip genes explaining most  of the phenotypic variation observed in the segregating medicago populations. the derived markers are valuable tools for selection of this trait in a pasture breeding program and the close correlation of biomass and b toxicity qualifies b toxicity tolerance as a priority trait. the close correlation of mtnip <dig> expression and b concentration in roots and leaves of tolerant and intolerant lines suggests that this member of the gene cluster is the most promising candidate for a b tolerance gene in this species. it further suggests that the molecular basis of b detoxification in medicago differs from that observed in the monocot barley where differential expression of hvnip2; <dig> in the roots  <cit>  and a greater boron-efflux transporter gene activity in the leaves  <cit>  has previously been identified as the molecular basis of b toxicity alleviation. further physiological studies on guttation and b leaching through rain, as recently described for barley  <cit>  are required to quantify the possible role of these two mechanisms in mediating b toxicity tolerance.
