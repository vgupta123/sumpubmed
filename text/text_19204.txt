BACKGROUND
the ability of cytosine deaminase  to convert the clinically used antifungal agent 5-fluorocytosine  into one of the most potent and largely used anticancer agent such as 5-fluorouracil  raised considerable interest in this enzyme to design innovative anticancer therapies  <cit> . therefore, cd-based enzyme/prodrug strategies are under investigation to model gene or antibody directed enzyme-prodrug therapy  for achieving high local concentration of 5-fu without significant systemic toxicity  <cit> . in in vivo animal model, the cd gene/enzyme which is not naturally expressed in mammals are first introduced into the cells of a tumour by specific antibodies  <cit> , modified microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses or synthetic vectors  <cit> . when the discrimination between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels is sufficient, 5-fc is given i.v., which is converted into 5-fu by cd within the tumor  <cit> . a convincing demonstration that such a complex system can be developed for clinical use requires evidence that each of the components of the gene/antibody complex functions by the mechanisms proposed  <cit> . this can be provided by well defined measurements including the concentration levels of the antibody-enzyme conjugate or de novo expressed enzyme, in plasma, tumor and normal tissues  <cit> . to allow the detection of cd expression at the protein level, we raised a human monoclonal antibody in single chain fragment  format against a recombinant cd from yeast  proved to be functionally active in nmr and in in vitro studies to convert the antifungal drug 5-fc into the anticancer compound 5-fu. the specificity of the human scfv was confirmed by western blot and elisa analyses. with this antibody, ycd expression can now be monitored without interfering with its enzymatic function in gdept, adept and other studies leading to the effect of the so called tumour amplified protein expression and targeting  to localize in vitro and in vivo generation of the anticancer agent 5-fu  <cit> .

RESULTS
the cd/5-fc-based gdept or adept are among the most studied strategies aiming to improve the therapeutic ratio  of cancer chemotherapy. cd has the ability to deaminate the non toxic prodrug 5-fc into the highly toxic compound 5-fu. by inhibiting dna synthesis this drug preferentially kills tumour cells. however, 5-fu has high gastrointestinal and hematological toxicities  <cit> . in contrast, the prodrug 5-fc is fairly nontoxic  <cit> . and cd is not naturally expressed in mammalian cells. thus, the selectively guided cd/5-fc complex should minimize the toxic effects of 5-fu because the conversion of 5-fc to 5-fu should only occur within the tumor.

a convincing demonstration that this strategy can be developed for clinical use requires knowledge of specific parameters which may include the in in vivo monitoring of the cd complex. for this reason we have firstly constructed a novel expression system for the production of a functionally active ycd. subsequently a fully human antibody in scfv format not interfering with ycd activity was developed and analyzed.

expression and purification of ycd protein
a functionally active ycd was generated by recombinant dna technology. the gene encoding for ycd was amplified and inserted into the pqe30xa expression vector which contained the lac promoter for protein induction and  <dig> × his tag sequence for purification .  <dig> base pairs band shown in figure 1b corresponded to dna fragment encoding for ycd obtained by pcr using specific primers. after tg <dig> e. coli bacterial strain transformation, several clones were isolated and proved suitable for ycd production. the clone exhibiting the best protein induction was further characterized. the yield of purified protein was about  <dig> mg l- <dig>  using metal chelate affinity chromatography. the reliability of this novel expression system used for protein isolation and purification was confirmed by biochemical investigation showing that ycd migrated at the expected molecular weight of about  <dig> kda .

selection and characterization of scfvh <dig> antibody specific for ycd
to isolate phage-displayed specific antibodies, an aliquot of the human synthetic eth- <dig> library containing approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu phages was panned into nunc-immunotubes coated with  <dig> μg ml-1of purified ycd. non-specifically absorbed phages were removed by intensive washing. specific bound phages were eluted, amplified and used for next panning as previously described  <cit> . by using this protocol, we were able to isolate a phage-antibody population specifically recognizing ycd protein after only three rounds of selection. plating on agar of tg <dig> cells infected with a pool of phage antibodies from third selection allowed individual clones harboring phagemid to grow. soluble scfvs derived from iptg inducted colonies, were screened by elisa and several of them proved to be specific for ycd protein . one of the most reactive scfv antibody clone, named h <dig>  was isolated and further characterized under biochemical and genetic aspects.

western blot studies showed that scfvh <dig> recognizes a protein band of about  <dig> kda corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the purified ycd protein . the genes encoding for variable regions of heavy  and light  chains of the scfvh <dig> were sequenced, and their corresponding amino acid aligned  according to pini et al.,  <cit> .

determination of ycd activity
in order to determine the functional activity of the recombinant ycd, the ability of the enzyme to deaminate 5-fc was assessed by fluorine nmr. this approach allowed simultaneous detection of the substrate and the product without interference by other compounds. figure  <dig> shows that after  <dig> min 5-fc was completely converted into 5-fu in the presence of the ycd. absolute quantification of the product was obtained by adding a known amount of 5-fu to the reaction mixture at the end of the experiment.

the specific ycd enzymatic activity was also assessed by spectrophotometric analysis in order to determine nanomolar concentrations of the reaction product. figure 5a shows the initial velocity of the reaction which is represented by direction coefficient of the line plotted placing concentration of formed 5-fu versus reaction time.

in order to assess if the enzymatic activity of ycd was affected by the presence of the scfvh <dig> an identical experiment was performed in presence of the antibody. figure 5b shows that the rate of product formation was similar to that with free ycd, suggesting that there was no apparent loss in enzyme activity as a result of binding with scfvh <dig>  identical results were obtained using the irrelevant scfvgo antibody .

cytotoxic assay
using an in vitro model constituted by human lovo cells, we measured the enzymatic activity of the recombinant ycd protein in converting the antifungal agent 5-fc into the highly toxic anticancer compound 5-fu. in parallel we evaluated if co-incubation of the same reagents with scfvh <dig> affected ycd function. figure 6a shows that  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> of ycd exerted a significative cell growth inhibition of the human carcinoma lovo cells in the presence of 5-fc concentration ranging from  <dig> mg ml- <dig> and  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  in contrast, the co-incubation of ycd and 5-fc with various concentration of scfvh <dig> did not interfere with the cytotoxic activity of de novo generated 5-fu .

the results above reported demonstrated that, ycd produced by the novel expression system here described acts as an active enzyme in converting 5-fc into the anticancer compound 5-fu. moreover, the binding of the human scfvh <dig> with ycd did not affect the enzyme function. in particular, our studies demonstrated that the presence of scfvh <dig> did not interfere with ycd in converting 5-fc or with the cytotoxic activity of de novo formed 5-fu.

CONCLUSIONS
the monoclonal antibody scfvh <dig> may be a very useful reagent for detection of cd expression in gdept/adept studies. in fact, this mab detects functional ycd either in elisa or in western blot studies  thus providing evidence that similar techniques may be extended to measure ycd levels in plasma, tumor and normal tissue samples. since its particular genetic origin, the scfvh <dig> can be easily genetically engineered to construct a whole human antibody with a predefined igg subclass, for selective removal of mab-ycd conjugate from the circulation, without interfering with the enzyme function.

differently with other mabs to cd generated by hybridoma  <cit>  or recombinant dna technologies  <cit> , the scfvh <dig> is the first fully human monoclonal antibody in scfv format so far described which is able to detect ycd protein in different routinary laboratory techniques. hence, this antibody may represents an excellent candidate for in vivo detection and measurement of the cd complex in the future development of cd-based selectively guided tumor therapy.
