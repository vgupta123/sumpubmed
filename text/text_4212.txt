BACKGROUND
the role of transposons in evolution has long been greatly underestimated. viewed as genomic parasites, transposons were classified as part of the so-called “junk-dna” and largely ignored, even though transposons and transposon-remnants make up significant fractions of eukaryotic genomes
 <cit> . forty four percent of the human genome and more than 85% of the maize genome consists of transposons and their relics
 <cit> . new views have led to the insight that transposons have shaped the genomic landscape in almost every conceivable way: shuffling, addition and deletion of not only new coding and regulatory sequences, but of large stretches of chromosomes as well
 <cit> .

although a more detailed classification system is now being used, two major classes of transposable elements  exist: retrotransposons, which transpose by using a rna intermediate, and dna transposons, which transpose by cutting their genomic sequence and inserting it elsewhere in the genome. these te’s are referred to as “copy-paste” elements and “cut-paste” elements, respectively
 <cit> . retrotransposons encode several proteins that are highly similar to those encoded by retroviruses. one of these proteins is a reverse-transcriptase that is able to reverse-transcribe the full-length transposon mrna into dna, after which the new copy is integrated in the genome
 <cit> . dna transposons encode proteins, called transposases, which are able to cut their own coding sequence from the genomic dna, by recognizing flanking repeats, and inserting it elsewhere in the genome. high transposon activity would be deleterious for the host and therefore defense mechanisms have evolved to counteract transposase activity. still, transposons are numerous in almost every eukaryotic genome and thus have successfully managed to sustain themselves
 <cit> .

transposons have contributed greatly, not only to shaping the genomic landscape, but also to the coding material of endogenous genes, for instance by giving rise to chimeric proteins . many conserved protein domains have now been shown to originate from transposable elements 
 <cit> . in the process called “domestication” a transposase loses its original function and acquires new functionality, creating a novel gene. various genes in different species have been found to be domesticated transposases . a recurrent theme in domestication seems to be the conversion of transposases encoded by dna transposons into important host proteins such as chromatin-related proteins and transcription factors. among these factors are cenp-b, a centromere protein in vertebrates and fungi, the far1-fhy <dig> family, involved in far-red light signaling in plants and beaf- <dig>  a boundary element associated factor in drosophila melanogaster <cit> . these elements are derived from, pogo, mudr and hat super-families of “cut-paste” elements respectively. this evolutionary trend can be explained by the fact that the transposases of these elements all contain dna binding domains and protein-protein interaction domains, since they work in conjunction with host factors to enable the transposition process
 <cit> . it seems likely that host partners of these transposases include chromatin remodelers, dna repair genes and/or endonucleases, since one can envisage players in these fields to be required for facilitation of the “cut-paste” process. remarkably, very little is known about these potential factors and the steps of the transposition process.

daysleeper was first described in  <dig> by bundock and hooykaas
 <cit> . the daysleeper gene in arabidopsis thaliana is an example of molecular domestication of a dna transposon. daysleeper shares extensive homology with members of a large subfamily of transposable elements, the hat transposons, which are widely spread throughout the tree of life and are found in all eukaryotic branches, except in trichomonas, diatoms, and ciliates
 <cit> . unlike these elements, daysleeper is not able to transpose, since it lacks the hallmark repeats essential for this process. also, a number of amino acids shown to be essential for the transposition of the ac-element, the first described hat transposon family member of maize, are not conserved in daysleeper
 <cit> . daysleeper was found to be essential to arabidopsis thaliana, as displayed by a severe developmental phenotype in daysleeper mutants. the gene most likely codes for a dna-binding protein, since it was identified through binding to the promoter of the dna repair gene ku <dig> in a yeast one-hybrid assay
 <cit> . daysleeper consists of  <dig> amino acids, possesses a dna binding bed-type zinc finger domain and a hat dimerization domain
 <cit> .

here we present data on the presence of putative daysleeper orthologs in angiosperms, including the basal angiosperms. we show that sleeper genes are present in many species, often in multiple copies. furthermore, we postulate a theory on the domestication process of the ancestral sleeper gene.

RESULTS
daysleeper orthologs in the genome of oryza sativa and vitis vinifera
two genes that are possibly orthologous to daysleeper, were identified by benjak et al. 
 <cit>  in a genome-wide analysis of hat-transposons in the grapevine genome and named vinesleeper <dig> and  <dig>  in a study on the transcriptional activity of transposons in rice, several sequences were designated as “daysleeper-like”
 <cit> . we used the daysleeper sequence as a query to find the most related sequences in the genomes of arabidopsis, grapevine and rice and produced a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree with bootstrap values, depicted in figure
 <dig>  to reveal the relationship between the highest scoring blast hits in the arabidopsis, grapevine and rice genomes. this resulted in a clustering of putative sleepers among the hat-like transposase genes. the four putative orthologs we found in the rice genome only partly overlap with the daysleeper-like sequences reported by jiao et al. 
 <cit> . because of their high identity ricesleeper  <dig> and  <dig> are probably the result of a recent duplication event . one gene in arabidopsis, at1g <dig>  was found to be related to daysleeper. a homozygous t-dna insertion mutant  for this gene showed normal development. this gene is expressed, but may have become non-functional by a lack of the n-terminal r/k rich nuclear localization signal which is characteristically present in daysleeper and all rice- and vinesleepers or has acquired novel functionality. in order to determine their cellular localization, yfp-fusions were constructed for these sleeper genes and introduced in arabidopsis protoplasts. this revealed a nuclear localization for all sleepers from rice, grapevine and arabidopsis, but not for the product of the at1g <dig> gene, which is present in the cytosol and which we therefore named cytosleeper .
 <cit>  and supplemented with the most homologous sequences from both the oryza sativa, vitis vinifera and the arabidopsis thaliana genomes, found in genomic databases using tblastn queries. gene identicators starting with “loc_os” “loc10” or “at” indicates genes from rice, grapevine and arabidopsis, respectively. phylogeny was created using raxml, with bootstrap values
 <cit> .

sleeper structure and conserved domains
we found that genes coding for sleepers are conserved between different species. sleepers contain hat motifs that are widely conserved in hat transposases. six hat motifs are generally found in hat transposases from various species, which are named motif a to f
 <cit> . sleepers contain a k/r rich nuclear localization domain  adjacent to a bed-type zinc finger at their n-terminal region and have a hat transposase-like dimerization domain at the c-terminus 
 <cit> . like hat transposases, sleepers are generally present in the nucleus . in daysleeper, the c-terminal dimerization domain is functional as well , allowing daysleeper to homodimerize. like daysleeper, rice- and vinesleepers lack the amino acids necessary for transposition and the genes are not flanked by hat repeat sequences .
 <cit> .

the sleepers form a separate group when compared to other hat-transposases . sleepers contain three strongly conserved motifs, that we designated sleepermotifs <dig> to  <dig> . sleepermotif <dig> encompasses part of the bed-zinc finger, raising the possibility that sleepers might bind conserved sites in different species. sleepermotif <dig> does not overlap with any of the conserved hat blocks and is, in contrast to sleepermotif <dig> and  <dig>  not exclusive to sleepers, since blast searches using this motif also yield hat transposases in various species that lack sleepermotif <dig> and  <dig>  sleepermotif <dig> overlaps largely with hat block e. this hat block is part of the hat dimerization domain, in conjunction with hat block d and f, suggesting that other sleepers can dimerize like daysleeper and other hat transposases
 <cit> . localization of sleepers is nuclear in arabidopsis protoplasts, but cytosleeper, which lacks the k/r rich conserved array adjacent to the bed-zinc finger, is present in the cytosol, suggesting that this domain is indeed necessary for nuclear localization of sleepers . the divergent sequence of cytosleeper, represented by the long branch-length in figure
 <dig>  and the lack of an apparent phenotype in mutant plants indicate that this gene might be pseudogenized or has obtained a different function as daysleeper. sleeper genes from arabidopsis, grapevine and rice, do not have introns in their coding sequences. most other sleeper genes contain one intron between the 5’ utr and their start-codons. daysleeper shares ~50% identity  with the vinesleepers and between  <dig> and 43% identity with the ricesleepers  at the amino acid level . rice- and vinesleepers vary in length between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids . the increased length of ricesleeper <dig> is mainly caused by the acquisition of extra coding sequence at its n-terminus. the relatively large size of cytosleeper is predominantly due to an additional stretch of amino acids between the second and third of three conserved motifs, which is not found in other sleepers.

similarity and identity values, as well as the length of the sleeper, are depicted. the numbers were obtained using alignx in the invitrogen vector nti suite .

sleepers are only present in higher plants
an important question is where and when the sleepers have emerged in evolution. to answer this question sleepermotif <dig> and  <dig> consensus sequences and daysleeper were used in tblastn searches in genomic and est databases from several organisms. queries with the sleepermotifs yielded exclusively high-scoring hits for sleeper-like sequences in the monocotyledonous  and dicotyledonous species searched. in databases of species beyond the plant realm, namely saccharamyces cerevisiae and drosophila melanogaster, no similar sequences were found . also, the est library for gymnosperm species ginkgo biloba  and a mixed pinus-species library  did not yield any significant hits , neither did queries in databases of the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii  and the moss physcomitrella patens  . however, lower angiosperm est databases  yielded hits in several species of different orders, namely persea americana , liriodendron tulipifera , nuphar advena  and amborella trichopoda  . these data indicate that sleeper genes belong to an angiosperm specific gene family and that formation of the first sleeper gene coincided with the evolution of angiosperms.

tblastn searches were performed on the est databases of the aagp . only unique ests are shown. the cut-off score for ests found with the full-length daysleeper sequence tblastn query is  <dig>  queries were performed with sleepermotif <dig> and  <dig> and the full-length amino acid sequence of daysleeper.

sleepers are frequently copied in several species
tblastn searches using the amino acid sequence of daysleeper in genomic databases of several sequenced angiosperm species , revealed that sleeper genes are present in all these queried genomes and often in multiple copies . figure
 <dig> depicts a maximum likelihood-tree with bootstrap values, generated with the raxml algorithm
 <cit> . many genomes appear to have several daysleeper homologs. sleeper genes possess the three sleepermotifs and were distinguished from hat transposase sequences by a blast score of over  <dig>  whereas hat-like sequences typically did not score higher than  <dig> 
 <cit> , processed by the raxml algorythm, with bootstrap values enabled
 <cit> . clusters have been given a color.

it is clear to see a clustering of sleeper genes from poaceae, separated from those of dicotyledonous plants, which form two groups, grouping with either cytosleeper or daysleeper . lotussleeper <dig> is exceptional in that it has diverged rather far from the other sleepers in dicotyledonous plants. since vinesleeper <dig> and  <dig> were described by benjak et al.
 <cit>  and these proteins cluster in separate groups, we decided to use a similar naming scheme for all sleepers. we found synteny between the genomic regions in which the vinesleeper <dig> and daysleeper genes reside, suggesting they are homologs . although high similarity exists between ricesleepers, we chose to designate the ricesleepers with individual numbers, namely  <dig> to  <dig>  the coding sequence of ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> are almost identical , as are ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig>  olimsleeper2a and 2b and popsleeper2b and 2c. these may therefore be relatively recent duplications, which had been shown previously for the genes in olimarabidopsis pumila by hall et al.
 <cit> . in dicotyledonous plants, all recent duplications seem to have occurred in the daysleeper-branch of the phylogeny shown in figure
 <dig>  when looking closer at the rice genome, there is no evidence for a segmental duplication of the genomic location of the ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> genes, since there is no apparent sequence homology or synteny of the region surrounding these genes. the close relatives of arabidopsis thaliana, namely olimarabidopsis pumila, arabidopsis arenosa and capsella rubella, have homologs of the cytosleeper gene, but these genes are not depicted in the phylogeny, since the complete genome sequence of these species was not available at the time of the analysis .

unlike cytosleeper, genes clustering with vinesleeper <dig> do code for a k/r-rich putative nuclear localization domain. most dicotyledonous species analyzed also have a homolog in both the cytosleeper, as well as the daysleeper cluster . exceptions are poplar, which has three popsleepers clustering with daysleeper, lotus japonicus, which has lotussleeper <dig> clustering with daysleeper and lotussleeper <dig>  which has diverged from other sleepers and carica papaya, which apparently has only one sleeper. this might suggest that sleepers clustering with daysleeper are functionally more conserved than cytosleeper-clustering sleepers. it has to be noted that two auxiliary sleeper-like genes were identified in carica papaya. these genes showed blast  values of just below  <dig> in relation to daysleeper and did not possess a conserved sleepermotif <dig>  these genes were therefore not included in figure
 <dig>  if they were included in the alignment, these sequences cluster with lotussleeper <dig>  albeit with very long branch-length .

rice- and vinesleeper cause a dominant phenotype when expressed in arabidopsis
to assess functionality of the sleeper genes found in other species, we attempted to complement the daysleeper phenotype with coding sequences from rice and grapevine under control of the  <dig>  kb upstream region of daysleeper, including the 5’utr. we found that the daysleeper phenotype cannot be complemented by these constructs, although we were able to restore the wild-type phenotype with gfp:daysleeper constructs. we found seedlings with the daysleeper phenotype despite the presence of either one of the ricesleepers  or vinesleepers .

interestingly, the complementation constructs did invoke a dominant phenotype in arabidopsis plants with the daysleeper-gene still present. such plants made an excess of rosette leaves, often curled, and were delayed in formation of inflorescences and in flowering . furthermore, these plants formed small siliques, suggesting issues with seed development . interestingly, we did not observe differences between plants containing the various constructs. however, we did observe differences in phenotype severity among plants that were direct descendants of a primary transformant . this suggests that the observed phenotype is associated to sleeper abundance, influenced by daysleeper hetero- or homozygosity or the number of t-dna inserts. daysleeper overexpression under control of the strong 35s promoter results in a similar phenotype as described above
 <cit> , also we observed similar phenotypic traits in some plants when trying to complement daysleeper mutant plants with a gfp:daysleeper construct . complementation of daysleeper was not found with the coding sequence of at1g <dig>  under control of the daysleeper promoter region. multiple plants of four individual t -dna insertion lines were extensively analyzed, but none of these revealed a rescue of the daysleeper phenotype, or resulted in daysleeper overexpression-like phenotypes.

ricesleeper <dig> and ricesleeper2
ricesleeper  <dig> and  <dig> have nearly identical coding sequences and probably both have arisen from relatively recent duplication events. a comparison between the ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> loci can be seen in figure
 <dig>  ricesleeper <dig> is predicted to have an intron in its 5’ utr, whereas ricesleeper <dig> is predicted to be intronless. to verify these predictions, we designed primers based on available mrna and est sequences and tried to amplify the 5’ utr from rice cdna  . the pcr-fragments we obtained were isolated and sequenced. we found two different transcripts for ricesleeper <dig>  which we named “a” and “b” . gene model a corresponds with the predicted transcript , whereas the transcript depicted in gene model b contains an unspliced utr that stretches to ~1500bp upstream of the start codon . for the ricesleeper <dig> gene, no utr’s other than the predicted intronless  <dig> bases directly adjacent to the start codon could be amplified.
3: table s <dig> 

to study whether ricesleeper mutation would result in similar developmental defects as seen in the a. thaliana daysleeper mutant, two rice t-dna insertion lines were obtained 
 <cit> . ricesleeper <dig> is disrupted by a t-dna insertion in the coding sequence at approximately  <dig> bp from the start codon . the t-dna insertion in the ricesleeper  <dig> locus is located in the 3’utr of the gene . presence of the t-dna was verified by pcr .

hygromycin resistant heterozygous seeds were obtained and grown and progeny of these plants analyzed. for both insertion lines only wild-type and heterozygous plants were identified, indicating that plants containing an insert in both copies of either ricesleeper <dig> or ricesleeper <dig> might be lethal at a very early stage. hygromycin-resistant progeny of the ricesleeper <dig> insertion mutants reached about half the height of wild-type plants . ricesleeper <dig> insertion mutants also remained somewhat smaller than wild-type plants , but not as small as ricesleeper <dig> mutants. ricesleeper <dig> mutants produced a normal amount of seeds, but ricesleeper <dig> mutant plants produced mostly empty panicles, yielding only very few seeds , indicating a lethal embryo defect. organs of both insertion mutants developed normally. however, yellow discolorations were observed in ricesleeper <dig> mutant plant leaves , which are not present in wild-type plants , or ricesleeper <dig> mutant plants .

discussion
daysleeper conservation
all sleepers have highly conserved features in the form of their n-terminally located bed-zinc finger dna binding domain, flanked by a nuclear localization domain and the c-terminal dimerization domain. these partly overlap with sleepermotif <dig> and  <dig> respectively, whereas sleepermotif <dig> is localized adjacent to the dimerization domain, but has no overlap or homology to any known functional domain or motif. the cytosleeper gene seems to be a divergent homolog of daysleeper. cytosleeper possesses the sleepermotifs, but has lost its nuclear localization signal, which is highly conserved in other sleepers. this sequence divergence and the lack of the nuclear localization motif might indicate pseudogenization. cytosleeper has relatively well conserved sleepermotifs and phylogenetically clusters with the sleepers , but its amino acid sequence is only  <dig> % identical to daysleeper . a homozygous insertion mutant  displays no phenotype and its coding sequence cannot complement the daysleeper phenotype. however, it seems likely that cytosleeper has acquired novel functionality, since it seems that a selective pressure exists to maintain cytosleeper. we calculated the ratio of the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site  to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site , to determine if selection pressure exists to maintain cytosleeper. ka/ks ratio  is similar to that of daysleeper , when comparing these genes in arabidopsis thaliana and capsella rubella .

the highly conserved dna-binding domain, which spans the location of the second α-helix of the bed-zinc finger
 <cit> , might hint to a conserved recognition sequence for all sleepers. sleepermotif  <dig> is located in the dimerization domain of the sleeper coding sequence. the dimerization domain is essential for daysleeper function, since a c-terminal truncation lacking this domain is not able to rescue the daysleeper phenotype . the high conservation of the dimerization domain in sleeper genes also offers the theoretical possibility of heterodimerization between sleepers, for instance in the case of daysleeper and cytosleeper. heterodimerization can theoretically take place, since expression patterns of these genes overlap in several tissues . the possibility of heterodimerization is even likely in the case of ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig>  since their coding sequences are almost identical and their expression patterns partly overlap
 <cit>  . we have found that nuclear heterodimerization is possible in vivo for daysleeper and ricesleeper <dig>  in a bi-molecular fluorescence complementation  assay in arabidopsis protoplasts, using daysleeper:yc and yn:ricesleeper <dig> fusion proteins . the ability to heterodimerize may offer an interesting layer of complexity to the function of sleeper proteins in several species.

sleeper complementation
although complementation of daysleeper is not found with constructs containing other sleepers, these constructs cause a dominant phenotype in arabidopsis . the transformed plants display developmental issues: delayed formation of the inflorescence and irregular and increased formation of leaves, fasciation and dwarfism have been observed in all lines. this phenotype resembles the overexpression phenotype of plants bearing a 35s:daysleeper construct
 <cit>  and it is probable that this effect is caused by increased expression of sleeper genes in these plants. this is further substantiated by the fact that mild overexpression phenotypes were also observed in some daysleeper mutant plants complemented with a gfp:daysleeper construct . the fact that sleepers cause this phenotype suggests that they are at least partially functionally similar to daysleeper. interestingly, the clustering of cytosleeper with other sleepers, such as vinesleeper <dig>  suggests that other species possess functional sleepers that are derived from the same duplication as the cytosleeper gene. in poplar, none of the sleeper genes found cluster with cytosleeper, suggesting that a sleeper derived from the duplication event mentioned above, was lost in this species.

ricesleeper  <dig> and 2
ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> are highly similar and have arisen from a duplication event . we suggest that these ricesleeper genes are relatively recently duplicated retrogenes. in the rice genome many retrocopies and retrogenes can be found, which could be explained by the overall high activity of ltr retrotransposons in this species
 <cit> . retrocopied genes are devoid of introns, since they are derived from mrna sequences and are flanked by short non-transposon-derived duplications. both ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> meet these criteria . recent retrocopies often possess a relic poly-a tail, derived from the mrna they originated from
 <cit> . both ricesleeper genes lack a clear poly a-tail. however, this feature is lost in many retrocopied genes, notably those derived from older retrocopy events
 <cit> . like other sleeper-proteins, ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> lack the amino acids necessary for transposition and are not flanked by the characteristic hat features 
 <cit> . transcription of the 5’ utr of both genes starts before the site where the genes become highly similar. it is thought that retrocopies can acquire new coding material from their site of insertion in the genome, or by secondary sequence insertions upstream, in a process called exonization . exonization seems to have taken place at the ricesleeper <dig> locus. the found 5’ utr of ricesleeper <dig>  largely overlaps with the first exon of a ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposon gene  which is predicted to be situated on the opposite strand. the parental template gene of ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> was not identified in the rice genome. this leaves the possibility that either ricesleeper <dig> or  <dig> has been retrocopied to give rise to ricesleeper <dig> or  <dig>  respectively. this would imply that both genes have acquired new 5’ utr sequences after the retrocopy event, or that a partial mrna served as a retrocopy template. a model of how we think the ancestral sleepers could have become domesticated will be discussed below. this model also includes exonization of coding material from a te insertion, which may have happened in the ricesleeper <dig> locus. ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> are differentially expressed, and mutants of these genes give rise to different phenotypes . we suspect the divergent expression patterns and/or the difference in the non-coding parts of their transcripts attribute to the differences which these genes play in the rice plant.

sleeper domestication
sleeper genes are domesticated transposase genes, but the mechanism of domestication remains undetermined. we propose that the ancestral domesticated sleeper gene was the result of a retroposition event. we suggest that the ancestral sleeper gene is the product of a hat transposase transcript being reverse-transcribed and integrated somewhere in the genome. the site of integration provided the retrocopy with regulatory elements and utr material, either by a secondary insertion of a te upstream or by sequences already present, turning the copy into a functional retrogene . we base our model mainly on the fact that all sleeper genes studied are without introns in their coding sequence, as opposed to hat transposase-genes, which typically contain introns . this is especially noteworthy in the light that also the most sleeper-related hat transposase-annotated genes that are expressed in both arabidopsis and oryza sativa, contain one or several introns in their coding sequence, based on est evidence . the mrna-derived poly-a tail, a feature of retrocopies, is lost over time by sequence erosion or a deletion event in the sleeper family, which has been reported to happen in many retrocopies
 <cit> . analysis of the skp <dig> gene family in angiosperms, for instance, revealed several retroposition events, but only one retrogene that possessed a poly-a tail was identified
 <cit> . obvious poly-a tails can also not be found in any of the sleeper loci in the grapevine and rice genomes. it is not surprising that poly-a tails from these domesticating retroposition events are not present anymore, since the origin of sleepers is apparently timed when gymnosperms and angiosperms separated  and most likely no selection pressure was exerted to maintain these short sequences
 <cit> . the short duplications flanking recent retrocopy events, like the sequences found at the ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> loci, have eroded in other sleepers . genome information of lower angiosperms and gymnosperms could facilitate a more in depth sequence analysis, but these sequence data were not available at the time of this study. ty1-copia elements have been found to be active in several gymnosperm species, potentially facilitating the creation of retrogenes
 <cit> .

hat-like genes, closely related to sleepers contain at least one intron in their coding sequence. most genes also possess  <dig> introns in their utr’s, which were not included in this table. ”*” indicates an est showing the presence of an intron, but without a predictive gene model in the tair genome browser.

all the evidence indicated above, together with the fact that we have found signs of a recent retrocopy event in the form of ricesleeper <dig> and  <dig> suggests that a retrocopy event may be responsible for the domestication of daysleeper. although alternative scenarios are conceivable, we think our model provides an elegant way for a transposase gene to shed its repeats and start a new, stable life elsewhere in the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that sleepers have conserved features and are often duplicated. we show that sleeper genes are an angiosperm-specific gene family, and that early in dicotyledon evolution two copies of sleeper genes were present. the sleeper family is an intriguing example of how transposons can give rise to new genes. analysis of the phylogeny of the sleepers reveals the dynamic interplay between transposons. in recent years many ways of shaping the genome by te’s have been described, and it seems without doubt that many more new genes derived from te’s and evolutionary effects of te’s will be uncovered in the coming years. the presence of sleeper genes in many species and the severe daysleeper phenotype in arabidopsis are testimony to their importance in higher plants. we show that the sleeper gene-family is angiosperm specific and that sleepers have become important genes in these plants, as was confirmed in rice, where t-dna insertions in sleeper genes gave rise to aberrant phenotypes. future studies may reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional role of daysleeper and its orthologs in plant development.
