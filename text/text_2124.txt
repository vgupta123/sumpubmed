BACKGROUND
myocarditis is an inflammatory heart disease with a wide variety of symptoms that range from mild dyspnea to cardiogenic death  <cit> . although viral infection is thought to be the most common cause of acute myocarditis in humans, myocarditis is also associated with various infections, drugs and toxins  <cit> . myocarditis is a relatively rare disease, and its incidence has been declining since the 1980s. however, 16% of the casualties of sudden infant death syndrome  <cit> , 62% of peripartum cardiomyopathies  <cit>  and a significant proportion of dilated cardiomyopathies  <cit>  may be caused by myocarditis, which indicate the seriousness of this disease.

to investigate the molecular and cellular etiology underlying myocarditis, two different experimental murine models, coxsackie viruses of group b -induced myocarditis  <cit>  and experimental autoimmune myocarditis -induced heart failure  <cit> , have been widely used. even though viral infections are known to account for up to  <dig> - 40% of myocarditis cases, the exact causes are still unknown  <cit> . because the exact trigger remains unknown in the majority of myocarditis patients and because myocardial injury appears to contribute to various autoimmune responses  <cit> , these two murine models are complementary alternatives for studying the molecular and cellular etiologies underlying myocarditis. recently, the myocardial proteomes of mice with cvb3-induced myocarditis were reported  <cit> . thus, we investigated the myocardial proteomes of rats with eam-induced heart failure to determine the similarities and differences between the two murine models to improve our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of myocarditis.

in this study, we found that  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were significantly up- or down-regulated, respectively, in the myocardial proteomes of eam rats, including unfolded protein response  target genes and proteins involved in the generation of precursor metabolites and energy metabolism in mitochondria. in addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinase -1/ <dig> and ribosomal protein s <dig>  were also activated in the eam-induced rat models.

RESULTS
histopathological characterization of experimental autoimmune myocarditis-induced heart failure in the rat
one of the pathological criteria for the definition of myocarditis includes the presentation of an interstitial inflammatory cellular infiltrate with necrotic swollen myocytes from hematoxylin/eosin . these pathological features were not observed in the heart sections of age-matched control rats  or rats  <dig> days after eam treatment . together with the decreased body weights of the rats  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after eam , these pathological results revealed eam-induced heart failure in the rats.

unfolded protein response-related proteins and proteins involved with the generation of precursor metabolites and energy metabolism were among the dysregulated proteins in eam rat hearts
to identify proteins that were differentially expressed in the hearts of eam rats, 2-de-based, unbiased proteomic studies were performed . for quantitative analyses, the normalized spot volumes of the 2-d gels from eam rat heart tissues were compared with those of age-matched control rat heart tissues. thirty-eight spots were significantly up-regulated in the eam rats compared to the age-matched control rats, while  <dig> spots were significantly down-regulated . only  <dig> of the  <dig> spots identified by nano-hplc-esi-qit-ms contained more than  <dig> proteins . the lists of proteins with up- and down-regulated spots were loaded into the panther website http://www.pantherdb.org <cit>  to categorize them according to their biological functions . of the  <dig> up-regulated proteins in the eam rat heart tissues,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins were allocated to transport, cellular processes, and metabolic processes, respectively . in contrast, of the  <dig> down-regulated proteins,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins were assigned to system processes, the generation of precursor metabolites and energy, and metabolic processes, respectively . interestingly, when the dysregulated proteins were combined and analyzed by the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes   <cit> , up- or down-regulated proteins, as indicated in figure 2b by red or blue colored nodes, respectively, showed confidential association only to the same color of nodes, even though several of the red or blue nodes were not linked to any other nodes. glucose regulated protein  <dig>  grp <dig>  endoplasmic reticulum protein  <dig> , protein disulfide isomerase family a, member  <dig> , calreticulin , thioredoxin , calcium-binding protein  <dig> , proteasome activator complex subunit  <dig> , proteasome subunit beta type- <dig> , proteasome subunit alpha type- <dig> , tropomyosin beta chain , tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain , tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain , annexin a <dig> , heat shock protein beta- <dig> , nucleoside diphosphate kinase a , and 40s ribosomal protein sa  all showed strong associations among the up-regulated proteins . these strongly associated, up-regulated proteins are known to be involved in unfolded protein responses . in contrast, the mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex , mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> component subunit beta , branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase e <dig> alpha polypeptide , mitochondrial 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase subunit beta , mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex , succinate-coenzyme a ligase, adp-forming beta subunit , succinate-coa ligase, gdp-forming, beta subunit , cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase , mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase subunit alpha, , mitochondrial atp synthase subunit delta , mitochondrial atp synthase subunit beta , heat shock cognate  <dig> kda protein , mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase subunit alpha , and hspb <dig> all showed strong associations among the down-regulated proteins . the down-regulated proteins that were classified as mitochondrial proteins have major roles in regulating the generation of precursor metabolites and energy metabolism.

progressively increased grp <dig> and grp <dig> in eam rats
the increased expression levels of grp <dig> and grp <dig> were confirmed via western blot analyses . compared to control rats, eam rats showed significantly increased levels of grp <dig> and grp <dig>  on eam days  <dig> and  <dig>  rats had  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold more grp <dig>  respectively, than the control rats . the levels of grp <dig> were significantly increased in all eam rats, i.e., a  <dig> -fold increase in eam day  <dig> rats, a  <dig> -fold increase in eam day  <dig> rats and a  <dig> -fold increase in eam day  <dig> rats . the confirmation of grp <dig> and grp <dig> up-regulation together with the proteomic analysis data showing significant increases of spot volumes containing er stress proteins  suggested that upr may be activated in eam rats.

erk-1/ <dig> and ribosomal protein s <dig> were activated in eam rats
akt signaling is involved in various cellular processes, including cell survival, growth and metabolism. to examine the role of akt in eam pathogenesis, the levels of total and activated akt were compared . the levels of total and activated akt <dig> were not significantly increased, except for total akt on eam day  <dig> , which suggested that cell proliferation or apoptosis might not contribute to eam pathogenesis.

we also examined whether erk-1/ <dig> signaling, which has been shown to play a role in the susceptibility to cvb3-induced myocarditis in mice, was altered  <cit> . the levels of total erk-1/ <dig> were significantly increased in eam day  <dig> and day  <dig> rats , and the levels of activated erk-1/ <dig> also appeared to increase in eam day  <dig> and day  <dig> rats . these results suggested that eam might increase erk-1/ <dig> translation and transcription and could contribute to the activation of erk-1/ <dig> 

because one of the key pathological hallmarks of myocarditis is swollen cytoplasm and nuclei of myocytes with increased translation and transcription  <cit> , and recently, ruvinsky and his colleagues have shown that the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s <dig>  enhances translation and cell growth in vivo  <cit> , the levels of total and phosphorylated rps <dig> were examined to investigate whether translational efficiency was increased in eam rats. the total levels of rps <dig> were not significantly increased except for eam day  <dig> rats . however, the levels of activated rps <dig> were significantly increased in eam day  <dig> and day  <dig> rats . these results suggested that eam could increase the translational efficiency of rat heart tissue.

discussion
eam-induced heart failure murine models, which represent a th <dig> t cell-mediated postinflammatory heart disease  <cit> , have been widely used to study the molecular and cellular basis of myocarditis pathogenesis  <cit> . because the myocardial proteomes of mice with cvb3-induced acute phase myocarditis have recently been reported  <cit> , we investigated the myocardial proteomes of acute phase eam rats to determine the similarities and differences in dysregulated proteins between the two murine models of myocarditis to improve our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of myocarditis. strikingly, of the  <dig> up-regulated proteins identified in this experiment , upr target genes, such as grp <dig>  grp <dig>  hspb <dig>  calr, and pdia <dig>  were also increased in the acute phase of cvb3-infected myocarditis mouse heart tissues  <cit> . this result suggests that upr activation may be a conserved cellular pathogenic mechanism in myocarditis that is caused either by viral infections or autoimmune responses. upr activation in eam rat heart tissues was confirmed by western blot analysis, using grp78- and grp94-specific antibodies . a more detailed report of the activation of upr and its consequences in cvb3-induced myocarditis was described in a study demonstrating that the infection of cardiomyocytes with cvb <dig> activated upr pathways and induced er stress-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . in addition, the treatment of eam rats with the antioxidant edaravone  <cit>  or the angiotensin ii type  <dig> receptor inhibitor olmesartan  <cit>  has been shown to attenuate er stress-mediated apoptosis, oxidative stress and cardiac inflammatory mediators. thus, upr signaling molecules might be good targets for the development of new therapeutic drugs or treatments aimed at ameliorating or curing enigmatic myocarditis.

among  <dig> down-regulated proteins that are mainly associated with the generation of precursor metabolites and energy metabolism in eam heart tissues , only atp5b and nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase  were also shown to be dysregulated in cvb-infected myocarditis rat heart tissues. atp5b and ndufs <dig> were significantly increased in the acute phase of cvb-infected myocarditis mouse heart tissues. however, they were significantly decreased during the chronic phase of cvb-infected myocarditis mouse heart tissues  <cit> . because other proteins that are known to be involved with the generation of precursor metabolites and energy metabolism in mitochondria, such as ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex core protein, succinate dehydrogenase, succinyl-coa ligase beta chain, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase e <dig> component and malate dehydrogenase, were also dysregulated in the cvb-infected myocarditis mouse heart tissues  <cit> , the impaired functions of mitochondria in both murine models of myocarditis may be an underlying common pathogenic mechanism of myocarditis.

in this study, we further tested whether other key cellular and biochemical features of myocarditis were conserved in eam rat heart tissues. first, we examined whether eam-induced hypertrophy occurs in cardiomyocytes, as a known cellular feature of myocarditis is an increased heart size with swollen cytoplasm and nuclei in the cardiomyocytes  <cit> . consistent with this feature, eam rat heart tissues did have similar levels of total and activated akt <dig> compared to the control rat heart tissues . next, we tested whether erk-1/ <dig> signaling was activated in eam rats because erk-1/ <dig> signaling has been shown to be involved in mouse susceptibility to cvb3-induced myocarditis  <cit> . interestingly, eam rat heart tissues had higher levels of activated erk-1/ <dig>  with significantly increased levels of total erk-1/ <dig> . because the nuclear localization of activated erk-1/ <dig> is known to be prolonged by oxidative toxicity  <cit> , eam-induced oxidative stress could contribute to the prolonged localization of activated erk-1/ <dig> in the swollen nuclei of cardiomyocytes, which would result in increased levels of total and activated erk-1/ <dig> in the cardiomyocytes. finally, we tested whether eam rats had significantly increased levels of activated rps <dig> because human patients with post-myocarditis show nuclear hypertrophy with an increased translation efficiency  <cit> , and recent studies have shown that activation of rps <dig> enhances translation and cell growth in vivo  <cit> . indeed, eam rat heart tissues contained increased levels of phosphorylated rps <dig> , which suggested that the mammalian target of rapamycin and p70-s <dig> kinase signaling might be activated in eam rat heart tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
upr, erk-1/ <dig>  and s6rp signaling we similarly activated in the two murine models of myocarditis. thus, the development of new therapeutic drugs and treatments should be aimed at deactivating upr, erk-1/ <dig>  and s6rp signaling.
