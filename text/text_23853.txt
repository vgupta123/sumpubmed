BACKGROUND
the honeybee  is a valued resource for both mankind and the global environment. honey is an important food product internationally, but pollination is by far the honeybee’s most valuable contribution  <cit> . bees contribute to almost 90 % of crop pollination around the world  <cit> . in canada, beekeepers need to store their hives to protect them from difficult wintering conditions. this storage seems to increase the colony sensitivity to infections, which is translated into a greater mortality of bees during the winter  <cit> .

however, the mechanisms involved in this decline of population linked to winter’s mortality remain unclear. some studies put forward the use of chemicals pesticides, including acaricides, which are detected inside the hives . sublethal exposures to chemicals like neonicotinoid pesticides lead to a disturbance of the behavior of foragers that failed to return to the hives  <cit> . on another point of view, a higher pathogen incidence can be responsible of the decline observed. that is why some research pointed to the impact of different pathogens . overall, it appears that some factors  or combinations of factors compromise the immunity of bees, and alter their behavior .

in honeybees, immunity operates on different levels  <cit> . individual immunity encompasses behavioral , mechanical, physiological and immunological defenses . pairwise defenses include allo-grooming and a colony-wide behavioral mechanism called hygienic behavior  <cit> , a type of nest-cleaning behavior. nurse bees in response to diseased or dead brood exercise this collective mechanism. hygienic behaviour is performed by younger bees  and mainly by middle age bees   <cit> . this cleaning is accomplished by two different actions. first, the nurses uncap the brood, which is operculated by wax , and secondly, they remove the pupae from the brood cell .

this hygienic behavior was first described in  <dig> by park, but its genetic basis was first suggested by rothenbuhler et al. , who proposed a two loci model to explain hygienic behavior inheritance . since then, this behavior has been recognized as an example of the influence of mendelian inherited genes on behavior. one locus  was thought to be involved in uncapping and the other  in removal. the homozygote for one of the loci should either uncap  or remove . later, a three loci model was developed to better fit the original data  <cit> . recently, four studies based on molecular techniques  found respectively seven, six, nine and two qtls associated with hygienic behavior . these results suggest that the genetic basis of hygienic behavior is more complex than previously thought.

a diseased brood detection threshold is determined by how quickly a nurse can detect and initiate the diseased brood removal process. this detection seems to be influenced by the olfactory capabilities of nurse bees . furthermore, it seems that all worker bees show various levels of hygienic behavior and its effectiveness is linked to the speed of execution. brain gene expression is closely related to behavioral status in honeybees  <cit> . therefore, in order to ensure identification of a reliable signal correlating both gene expression and hygienic behavior, we examined brain tissue from nurse bees of colonies that were the most contrasted in terms of the phenotypic trait of interest. this strategy has been proven to be valuable for detecting candidate genes  <cit> . in our study, we analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of  <dig> managed honeybee colonies. the objective was to investigate and compare differential gene expression between hygienic and non-hygienic lines in order to identify genes involved in hygienic behavior. ultimately, the goal was to provide functional genetic markers for snp analysis in order to develop useful genomic tools for honeybee selection programs.

RESULTS
in  <dig>  the  <dig> hives were evaluated for hygienic behavior using the freeze-killed brood assay  <cit> . data from a previous evaluation in  <dig>  performed on the same colonies, was also available . comparison of the two evaluations showed that hygienic behavior varied between years. to avoid any bias, we chose to classify the colonies as hygienic or not based on the  <dig> evaluation. a wide range of hygienic behaviors was observed during our experiment . in  <dig>  three colonies were classified as non-hygienic , five exhibited intermediate behavior and five were highly hygienic . extreme behaviors were selected for the transcriptome analysis in order to increase the detection power of deg.table  <dig> hygienic evaluation of the honeybee colonies studied. hygienic behavior is calculated as a percentage based on the number of dead brood removed in 24 h. brood were killed by liquid nitrogen



a total of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> reads were sequenced for the eight colonies most distinct in terms of hygienic behavior . the depth of sequencing among the different samples was homogeneous . the highest quality dataset was for colony  <dig>  and the lowest for colony  <dig> . we observed few variations in quality among samples , . further, a high number of the clean reads were assembled and mapped to the reference genome of a. mellifera  . unmapped reads were not retained in the analysis.table  <dig> statistical description of the sequencing data. good quality reads were pairs of reads with a phred score value higher than  <dig>  reads mapped were reads actually mapped to the reference genome of apis mellifera




from the  <dig>  <dig> genes referenced in the genome of a. mellifera,  <dig>  <dig> genes were found to be expressed in the hygienic pools and  <dig>  <dig> genes in the non-hygienic pools. the top  <dig> expressed genes were the same for the two behavioral conditions, but their order differed . all are genes involved in royal jelly production. the other major royal jelly protein genes  were also detected in our data, but at lower levels. ninety-six genes were found differentially expressed between hygienic and non-hygienic bees . twenty-eight genes were over-expressed in hygienic bees and  <dig> of these had a log <dig> fold change higher than  <dig>  meaning that expression of the gene was two times or higher in hygienic bees . the three most degs  were cyp6as <dig>  syn <dig> and loc <dig>  loc <dig> was appended to this list because it was not expressed in non-hygienic bees but lightly expressed in all hygienic colonies. mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes showed relevant patterns but, as they were not expressed in all hygienic colonies, were not statistically significant. these two genes were highly expressed in two colonies,  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. sixty-eight genes were over-expressed in non-hygienic bees , with a fold change higher than  <dig> for  <dig> of them. six genes were highly differentially expressed: hex70c, loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig> table  <dig> top  <dig> expressed genes of apis mellifera transcriptome

among the  <dig> degs,  <dig> were located on all the  <dig> linkage groups of the honeybee genome,  <dig> on the mitochondrial chromosome  and  <dig> on unplaced scaffolds . two of the three genes highly related to hygienic behavior were located on chromosome  <dig>  and the third one on chromosome  <dig> . concerning the non-hygienic genes, only hex70c and loc <dig> were located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the other genes were located on four different unplaced scaffolds.fig.  <dig> chromosomal position of the degs on the apis mellifera genome. red spots indicate a gene over-expressed on non-hygienic bees and; green spots indicate an under-expression in non-hygienic bees



genetic links with hygienic behavior have been studied previously in order to detect qtls associated to this behavior . by comparing our results to accessible previous data , the genomic sequences of  <dig> gene candidates  were located inside the confidence interval of 95 % of all the qtls influencing hygienic behavior .table  <dig> comparison of the degs found in transcriptome analysis with data from previous qtls studies. genes in red are over-expressed in non hygienic bees; green represents the over-expressed genes in non hygienic bees



for the  <dig> genes differentially expressed,  <dig> were associated with at least  <dig> go-term and  <dig> with an interproscan result. the ontology covered three domains: cellular component, molecular function and biological process. twenty-four go-terms classified in molecular function were found and were recovered by  <dig> genes . for the cellular component domain,  <dig> genes were assigned to  <dig> go-terms . fifty-nine genes were assigned to a biological process  . furthermore,  <dig> dges were assigned as potential transcription factors by direct blast to a drosophila gene belonging to the go-term dna binding or by the blast2go annotation with the go-terms dna binding or nucleotide binding. for the kegg pathways analysis,  <dig> genes were involved in  <dig> kegg pathways. kegg pathways and the enzyme involved are presented in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> multi-level pie chart of the major go-categories represented in the deg dataset. panel a represented the goterm associated to molecular function, panel b represented the go-term associated to cellular component andpanel c represented the go-term associated to biological process



gene set enrichment was performed to compare the enrichment of the different go-terms between the  <dig> genes differentially expressed and the whole genome. the results of this analysis indicate that go-term electron carrier activity  is over-represented in our degs. the genes involved in this go-term were: cyp4az <dig>  cyp6as <dig>  cyp6as <dig>  cyp6as <dig>  loc <dig>  cyp4g <dig> and loc <dig>  all of these genes were involved or considered as potentially involved in the cytochrome p <dig>  six of these genes were over-expressed in non-hygienic bees, and only gene cyp6as <dig> was over-expressed in hygienic bees.

discussion
to our knowledge, this study is the first to correlate honeybee hygienic behavior with differential gene expression. almost all previous studies that analyzed honeybee rna focused on the parasitic / pathogenic reaction and its variability among different honeybee castes . in this study, we used rna-seq to highlight, at the genomic scale, which genes are differentially expressed in hygienic versus non-hygienic colonies.

our data indicates that not all previously referenced genes present in the genome of honeybee are expressed in our bee brain samples. only  <dig>  <dig> genes  were found expressed in hygienic honeybees and  <dig>  <dig> genes  in non-hygienic bees. genes may be missing from our samples due to the fact that we studied gene expression only for the rna pools from bee brains, and not the entire tissue composites. it has previously been demonstrated that tissue specificity is highly important for rna-seq design  <cit> .

the distribution of gene expression was very similar between both behavioral states . this result can be explained by the fact that the most abundantly expressed genes were not differentially expressed . interestingly, the genes most expressed in our samples were all involved in processing royal jelly. this finding is consistent with a previous study that found nurses and foragers highly expressed the mrjp gene family  <cit> . as in the article of liu et al.  <dig>  we found a low level of expression of the mrjp  <dig> in bee brains.

the differences between the two behavioral states rely on few genes , which is 94 % less than differences between nurses and foragers   <cit> . however, this finding is consistent with results between such less-differentiated castes as guard, undertaker or comb builder  <cit> . it seems that, as for other task specializations , few genes influence the performance of hygienic behavior, and they are thus more tightly regulated than caste specialization. this could be explained by the fact that caste specialization  is strongly influenced by the environment  or age-related differences . the low numbers of genes differentially expressed  between the two intra-caste behavioral states may reflect a difference in bee age. consequently, as the difference in behavioral state is the only variable among our samples, these few degs relate to differing behavioral performance that occurs according to a design independent of any age limit or caste. furthermore, we hypothesize that expression of gene involved in the hygienic behavior is constitutive and not facultative, especially during the detection of diseased brood  <cit> . this ensures that the differential expression of these genes is related to the hygienic behavior and not to age or caste. this assumption is also supported by the fact that rna analysis was performed on a pool of  <dig> nurses so it represented the global transcription of the caste and not an individual gene expression event.

all degs are statistically significant  despite the fact that fold-changes are at low levels. low level fold-change acts in favor of a subtle modification of brain gene expression, much as has been suggested for task specialization  <cit> . however, if we consider the higher level of fold-change, gene dispersion is concentrated on unplaced scaffolds  and chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . interestingly, chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are known to carry qtls linked to honeybee hygienic behavior  <cit> . this result is also supported by the fact that genomic sequences of the  <dig> degs are located in the confidence interval of all the qtls influencing hygienic behavior  except for the qtl named hyg  <dig>  located on chromosome  <dig>  the qtl region localized on chromosome  <dig> by spötter et al. and the qtl found in chromosome  <dig> by tsuruda et al.  <dig>  these results show that the degs found in our study are consistent with the previous literature. however, it also seems that regulation of the gene expression linked to hygienic behavior is spread more widely throughout the genome than previously thought. the localization of these genes is, however, quite surprising, because it was thought that the genetic basis of hygienic behavior was localized on few loci. we unexpectedly found degs on all  <dig> honeybee chromosomes, as well as on mitochondrial chromosomes and unplaced scaffolds. these results suggest a wider regulation of the transcription. the high number of dges classified as potential transcription factors supports this supposition. four of them  are even located on hygienic qtl positions .

gene ontology analysis shows that the two biological processes most represented by the deg are multicellular organismal development and regulation of biological processes. this result indicates that most degs contribute to the development of larvae into adult bees and are also involved in gene expression regulation, protein modification or interaction with a protein or substrate molecule. these two biological processes are consistent with the theory that few genes have a wide influence . at the level of molecular function, the three most represented go-terms are protein binding, hydrolase activity and nucleotide binding. as previously discussed, protein binding and nucleotide binding are functions that are involved in the regulation of molecular processes like transcription. it seems that hygienic and non-hygienic bees differ in their transcription pathways. interestingly, hydrolase activity is particularly over-expressed in non-hygienic bees. hydrolase activity is a process involved in the catalysis of various bonds, including the catalysis of peptides such as the one that can signal the presence of diseased brood.

gene set enrichment analysis of the deg shows that only one go-term is over-represented : electron carrier activity . furthermore, all the genes associated with this go-term are involved or can be considered as potentially involved in cytochrome p <dig> pathway. among these genes, some are coding for different enzymes of the cytochrome p <dig>  these enzymes are known to be involved in many processes, particularly detoxification of xenobiotics and hormonal degradation. furthermore, they are suspected of playing a role in the degradation of odorants, pheromones or defensive chemicals  <cit> . the threshold for detection of diseased brood is one key factor in how quickly a nurse can detect and initiate the removal process. this detection capacity could be influenced by the nurse’s olfactory capabilities . we can therefore hypothesize that non-hygienic bees that over-express cytochrome p <dig> enzymes degrade the odorant pheromones or chemicals that normally signal the presence of diseased brood before activation of the removal process. the bees are then less efficient in detecting contaminated broods. the high level of cytochrome p <dig> enzymes in non-hygienic bees can be explained by two non-exclusive hypotheses. first, the non-hygienic bees may have a constitutively higher expression of these enzymes due to the differences observed in regulation patterns, as previously discussed. or, the induction of cytochrome p <dig> gene expression may be due to a higher sensitivity to xenobiotics. it has been demonstrated that xenobiotics can enhance the expression of cytochrome p <dig> genes  <cit> . a higher sensitivity to xenobiotics could then induce a stronger response by over-expressing cytochrome p <dig> genes, which in turn might alter the performance of hygienic behavior.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to characterize the transcriptomic basis of the differential performance of hygienic behavior by the honeybee . our findings show that hygienic behavior relies on a limited set of genes, most collocated with the qtls described in previous studies as playing major roles in honeybee hygienic behavior. the differences between behavioral states  can be explained by different regulation patterns  associated with an over-expression of cytochrome p <dig> genes. these candidate genes provide relevant targets for snps analysis  to develop molecular tools for honeybee genetic programs, which would provide a rapid and efficient method for selecting honeybee colonies with a high level of hygienic behavior.
