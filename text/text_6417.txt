BACKGROUND
the hierarchical structure and the detailed gene annotation of gene ontology  provide biologists a convenient tool to identify enriched gene sets in high-throughput omics-based experiments. in go, the ontology terms represent biological knowledge and describe functions for genes and gene products. go consists of three categories, i.e. molecular function , biological process  and cellular component . go provides rich information as an integrated resource and is convenient to study gene functional similarity  <cit> . with go, biologists can quickly test their biological hypotheses and design new experiments  <cit> .

various computational tools have been developed to identify functionally similar genes or gene products by comparing the annotated go terms. according to the types of information in go they use, these methods have been divided into three categories: 1) edge-based measurements, 2) node-based measurements, and 3) hybrid measurements  <cit> . in the first category, tools are fully dependent on the structure of go, so that these tools simply treat the terms at the same topological level equally  <cit> . in the second category, tools consider both the gene annotation and the common ancestors of the target terms. but they neglect the complex topology of go  <cit> . in the third category, tools focus on the topological property of the go structure but neglect the gene annotations  <cit> .

since none of the existing go-based gene function similarity measurements can consider all the information in go , we recently proposed two integrative measurements successively to unite the advantage of the existing measures  <cit> . our measurements automatically select and integrate seed measurements with a meta-heuristic search based method. in the following text, we briefly introduce our measurements; please refer to the algorithmic details at  <cit> . our algorithm has three steps. first, given a background gene set which includes a lot of genes, all their ranked similarity values are pre-calculated with all the selected go-based semantic similarity measurements . second, for every gene pair in user’s input, the most appropriate seed measurements are selected with a grouping method. finally, we develop a meta-heuristic search model and estimate its parameters by maximizing the distances between distinct ec groups which are manually curated. the algorithm has been tested on mf category, bp category, and protein sequence data. the experimental results indicate that our integrative measurement performs significantly better than the existing measurements.

various web-based applications have been developed to calculate gene functional similarities based on gene ontology. the web-based approach is favorable since users do not need to install tools and maintain the go data on their computers. the existing web-based go applications include gosstoweb  <cit> , proteinon  <cit> , funsimmat  <cit>  and g-sesam  <cit> . while choosing the best measurement for a specific gene set is critical, none of the aforementioned web-based applications provide a solution. on top of it, most of these tools use the pure text-based format as output. simply listing gene-to-gene similarity values in a big table neglects the fact that such data visualization is far beyond the direct perception of the human eyes. biologists face challenges to effectively reduce vast and diverse data into representations that can be interpreted in a biological context. moreover, there is currently no tools that allow researchers to wander around gene-to-gene associations and make discoveries by following intuition or simple serendipity.

it is desirable to develop an instant interactive web-based application that allows researchers to intuitively explore gene functional similarities and associations, and to visualize the results with an easy-to-use web interface. in this paper, we present intego <dig>  which, comparing with the existing semantic similarity web tools, has the following major advantages: 
intego <dig> is an integrative solution toward automatically choosing and weighing gene functional similarity measurements for the user provided gene set.

intego <dig> has an easy-to-use html <dig> based web interface. it can effectively visualize the network of genes based on their functional similarities.

intego <dig> is available for  <dig> species and supports  <dig> kinds of popular gene id types.



methods
intego <dig> is a browser/server  architecture-based web application. the back end is implemented using python  <dig>  and the web develop framework web.py. mysql is used for data management. in the front end, asynchronous javascript and xml  and javascript object notation  are used for efficient data transmission between the browser and server. html <dig> canvas and cytoscape.js  <cit>  are used as the graphics engine for the visualization. the go annotations of all organisms are downloaded from the go website  and are updated automatically to ensure that the most recent annotations are used. intego <dig> embed a gene id mapping api provided by uniprot website . a user can submit a gene list to web tool using one of the  <dig> different gene id types.

RESULTS
intego <dig> provides a convenient way to calculate and visualize the functional association between genes based on go. the user guide of intego <dig> is included in additional file  <dig>  there are two main operations to use intego2: 1) to submit a gene list and specify parameters, and 2) to visualize and download the gene functional similarities.

user inputs
the first user interface of intego <dig> requires inputs in three categories: the input genes and related information , choosing similarity measurement and go category , and user information . in the first category, a user can input a gene list  and select the organism and the type of gene name. currently,  <dig> organisms are supported . using the id mapping api from uniprot, we support up to  <dig> different types of gene ids belonging to  <dig> species.

o <dig>  the inputs are grouped into three categories: a the input genes and related information, b choosing similarity measurement and go category, and c user information



in the second category, a user can choose a similarity measurement and a go category. a recent measurement  <cit>  and six widely-used similarity measurements  are available to choose. also, we provide an integrative measurement of all the aforementioned approaches  <cit> . the description of these measurements is in subsection  <dig> .

in the third category, a user can leave an email address and the name of the experiment, so that notification will be sent to the user when the job is done. once all the information is submitted, we validate it for error checking. the validation process checks the format of input genes or gene pairs and all the user specified parameters. the user is notified immediately if any error is found. after that, we calculate the gene-to-gene similarities using the user specified measurement and construct a functional association network.

note that all the submitted jobs are maintained on the backend server by a job scheduler. once a job is finished, its job id will be sent to the user who submitted the job, if the user’s email address is provided. if a user does not leave the email address, the user should keep the submission webpage unclosed, so that the experimental results can be displayed on the same webpage. the experimental results will be kept on the back end server for at least two weeks. in addition we also keep the detailed information of the calculation process, such as the number of genes in the input list that cannot be measured because of lack of go annotations.

visualization interface
the visualization interface of intego <dig>  shows the resulting gene association network in the center of the web page, in which a node represents a gene, and an edge indicates that the similarity score between the two corresponding genes is greater than an edge similarity threshold. interactive browsing of the network can be performed conveniently using the mouse: scroll to zoom out or zoom in, left click to select a node, long-left click and drag to move the network, and long-right click a node to activate the node operation panel . using the node operation panel, a user can add the current gene to a gene list of interest shown in panel a, change node color, and lock a node for multiple node operations.

a user can adjust the edge similarity threshold by dragging the threshold bar or inputting a specific value, and the network will change simultaneously . to help choose the appropriate edge similarity threshold, the overall edge similarity scores distribution is displayed . a user can select different graph layouts for graph visualization . a user can also select subnetworks by specifying a gene subgroup .



the gene information panels  show the recently selected genes, current gene, and the neighbors of the recently selected gene respectively. by clicking a gene id, a user can fetch more detailed information about the gene from ncbi  and the go term information from amigo .

an illustrative example of using intego2
we use the sample gene list in intego <dig> website as the example to demonstrate how to use intego <dig>  first, we set the parameters in fig. 1a as follows: the organism is homo sapiens, the type of input is “gene list”, and the gene list is the sample gene list provided by the website in the uniprotkb ac/id format. second, in fig. 1b we select “integrative approach ” to be the go similarity measurement and molecular function to be the go category used in the measurement. the parameters in fig. 1c are optional, but we still enter an email address and provide the experiment name. finally, we click the “submission” button.

once our job is finished, we select “display the visualization of similarity” to view the experimental results using the visualization interface . by changing the gene-to-gene similarity threshold in fig. 2a, we generate two gene functional association networks with a different number of nodes and edges , and visualize them by selecting two different graph layouts, i.e., concentric and cola . given the gene functional association network in the right figure in fig.  <dig>  we choose three genes  as the interested genes, add them into a blank box in fig. 2a, and click the “select” button. then the subnetwork that only includes the selected genes is highlighted . we further add all the neighbor of the selected genes into the highlighted network  and save it to local hard drive as the final output.

go-based semantic similarity measures
eight go-based semantic similarity measures are available in our web tool intego <dig>  in this subsection, we will introduce the eight measurements briefly.

1) integrative approach 
the framework of intego <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  the whole process contains two parts: one part is gene-to-gene similarity calculation  for the input gene set g; the other part is model training , in which the parameters of intego <dig> are estimated using a training set t by maximizing the distances between distinct ec groups; in intego <dig>  two key problems are solved, i.e. to choose the most appropriate seed measures for each gene pair from all the candidate measures and to appropriately integrate the selected seed measures.

intego <dig> is an integrative measure of computing similarity. it automatically selects appropriate seed measures and then integrates them using a meta-heuristic search method  <cit> . intego <dig> has three steps. first, calculate all the similarity scores using all the candidate measures and rank them, resulting in a ranked matrix mr. second, a grouping process is applied on mr to identify the common features of all measures, with which we define seed measures for each gene pair, saved in scan. third, integrate all the measures in scan with an addition model, in which the weight of each component is estimated by applying a learning process on a training set. experimental results using ecs and pathways show that intego <dig> performs better than the existing measures. it also indicates that intego <dig> is robust against the unavailability of candidate measures. it is noted that an algorithm called intego was proposed in the previous work to unify different measures  <cit> , which can be considered as a simplified case of intego <dig>  the new functional association maps generated based on the gene-to-gene similarities based on intego <dig>  together with the existing biological networks, may provide more biological insights into gene function and regulation.

2) information content-based 
information content  of the lowest common ancestor  is a popular go term similarity measurement  <cit> , which combines ic and ontology structure. given a go term t, its ic can be calculated as ic=−log, where g and gt represent gene sets annotated to root term and t respectively. given two go terms ta and tb, we define glca as gene set annotated to the lca of ta and tb. the similarity of go term ta and tb is computed by eq.  <dig>  
  <dig> simresnik=ic=−log|glca||g| 

3) normalized information content-based 
given two go terms ta and tb, schlicker et al. proposed a method to measure their similarity as eq.  <dig>  the first part of eq.  <dig> used ic of ta and tb to normalized the ic of their lca. the second part of eq.  <dig> is a weighting score decided by the level of their lca in go. 
  <dig> simschlicker=2×icic+ic×1−|glca||g| 

4) topology information based 
different with the gene annotation based measurements, wang et al. developed a go topology based method that considers all the ancestor terms  <cit> . let ta and b be a go term and its ancestor term. we define the maximal semantic contribution of the linkages from ta to p as the semantic contribution of ta to p. the similarity of go term ta and tb is defined as follows. 
  <dig> simwang=∑p∈pa⋂pbsta,p+stb,p∑p∈pasta,p+∑p∈pbstb,p 

where pa and pb represent the sets of all the ancestors of ta and tb respectively.

5) union information-based 
let g <dig> and g <dig> be two genes. t <dig> and t <dig> represent the set of go terms annotation g <dig> and g <dig>  simui  <cit>  measures similarity as eq.  <dig>  
  <dig> genesimsimui=|t1⋂t2||t1⋃t2| 

6) graph information content 
combining simui and resnik measure, simgic sums information content  of the terms, not just count the terms  <cit> .

7) term overlap 
let g <dig>  g <dig> be two genes and t <dig>  t <dig> be the sets of go terms annotating g <dig>  g <dig> respectively  <cit> . to method computes the similarity score as follows. 
  <dig> genesimto=|t1⋂t2| 

8) hybrid relative specificity similarity 
let ta and tb be two go terms. to consider the topological information of go, relative specificity similarity  measure the distance from ta, tb to their closest leaf terms and the distance from ta, tb to their most recent common ancestor . based on rss, wu et al. proposed hybrid relative specificity similarity  employing adapting topology, information content and most informative common ancestor  <cit> . the similarity score between ta and tb is computed by following equations. 
  <dig> simhrss=11+dist+dist×w 

  <dig> w=ic−icic−ic+ic−ic+ic−ic <dig> 

where root represents the root term of go; mica represents the most informative common ancestor of ta and tb; mila and milb are the most informative child leaf of ta and tb respectively; dist represents the distance from x to y in go; ic represents the information content  of x.

CONCLUSIONS
the gene ontology  is a widely used bioinformatics resource. various methods and web tools have been proposed to compute gene functional similarities based on go. however, these tools only provide text file or web page includes similarity scores as final output for users, ignoring the appropriate visualization interface for result interpretation.

in this paper, we developed an easy-to-use web tool, named intego <dig>  which allows users to conveniently measure gene functional similarity with eight different measures and visualize the resulting gene functional association networks with a web interface. intego <dig> supports up to  <dig> different of gene ids belonging to  <dig> species. the go data used in intego <dig> tool could be updated automatically to keep consistent with the most recent data from the official website of go. in summary, intego <dig> is an easy-to-use web tool for researchers to measure and visulize go-based gene functional similarities.
