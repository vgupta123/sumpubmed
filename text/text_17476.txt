BACKGROUND
there are many different reasons for expressing exogenous dna sequences in mammalian cells. these reasons range from the necessity of gene therapy clinical trials or functional genomics analysis to simply the desire to analyze cis-acting genetic regulatory elements. in the latter instances, the introduced dna constructs are usually referred to as reporter constructs because the genes expressed from these constructs report the presence of the introduced sequences. regulatory genetic sequences of interest are combined with a reporter gene of choice to generate constructs in which the genetic elements control reporter expression. in most cases, the expression level of a reporter gene will correlate with the transcriptional activity of the regulatory genetic sequence of interest  <cit> . in addition to this largely predictable effect, there are also important, poorly understood, stochastic effects on the level of reporter expression.

in recent years, the simple notion of a reporter of sequence function has greatly expanded. now, reporter genes are used to visually identify transformed cells, calculate the efficiency of gene delivery systems, follow the intracellular fate of a gene product, monitor recombination events  <cit> , measure signal transduction  <cit> , detect the interaction of two proteins in the two-hybrid system  <cit> , or for noninvasive in vivo imaging of gene expression. examples of the latter are positron emission tomography  <cit> , magnetic resonance  <cit>  and optical imaging systems  <cit> .

despite these diverse uses of reporters, a steady and high level of gene expression is frequently the common goal with all uses. to achieve this, reporters have been used whose expression directly reflects the expression level of the gene of interest. the coexpression of heterologous gene products in a single vector is usually accomplished with either two independent promoters or an internal ribosome entry site   <cit>  sequences placed between two cdnas to transcribe a bicistronic mrna from a single promoter. however, the use of heterologous promoters can cause promoter interference, i.e., transcription from one promoter suppresses transcription from one another  <cit> . furthermore, a correlation between reporter expression and gene-of-interest expression is frequently lacking in these experiments. the use of ires sequence in bicistronic constructs eliminates promoter interference problems and directly couples the expression of a reporter gene to the expression of the gene of interest  <cit> . in most cases, the protein expression of the ires-dependent gene ranges between  <dig> and 50% of the protein expression of the 5' gene in the bicistronic message  <cit> . the arrangement and composition of reading frames can occasionally influence the strength of ires-dependent translation  <cit> .

depending upon the application, an ideal reporter should have the following features:  the reporter protein should be absent from the host or otherwise easily distinguishable from endogenous proteins;  it should be inert and not affect the physiology of the cell; and  simple, sensitive, and inexpensive methodologies methods should be available to detect and quantify reporter expression. currently, two types of reporter genes are commercially available and are classified as intracellular or extracellular reporter genes. intracellular reporter genes include: chloramphenicol acethyltransferase   <cit> , β-galactosidase  <cit> , aequorin  <cit> , green fluorescent protein   <cit> , firefly  <cit>  and bacterial luciferase  <cit>  and glucuronidase  <cit> . extracellular reporter gene products are secreted into the medium culture. these include: human growth hormone   <cit>  and secreted alkaline phosphatase   <cit> .

in this paper, we describe the use of the human interleukin- <dig>  p <dig> as a secreted reporter protein. il- <dig> is a heterodimeric cytokine of  <dig> kda composed of two chains, a heavy chain of  <dig> kda  and a light chain of  <dig> kda   <cit> . intact il- <dig> is necessary for the t cell-independent induction of interferon -gamma, for the development of a th <dig> response, and for the activation of differentiated t lymphocytes of both cd4+ and cd8+ phenotypes  <cit> . the p <dig> subunit is thought to be primarily involved in receptor binding while p <dig> is critical for signal transduction  <cit> . il- <dig> p <dig> by itself does not have any il- <dig> bioactivity; it is expressed only by macrophage and dendritic cells in response to antigenic stimulation, and its expression is easily detectable by elisa. because of this assembly of nearly ideal features, we explored the potential use of the il- <dig> p <dig> as reporter gene to measure the activity of cis-genetic elements, and in high-throughput screenings of engineered mammalian cells. our results show that the il- <dig> p <dig> is a very useful reporter gene. the protein assay is easy, inexpensive, and it is adaptable to applications that require sensitive quantitation or simply 'yes' or 'no' determination of gene expression. in particular, the il- <dig> p <dig> has several features that make it a particularly attractive reporter gene when compared to the commonly used seap.

RESULTS
time course of il- <dig> p <dig> accumulation
bhk- <dig> cell were transfected with pgk-p <dig> plasmid , and the time course for the expression of il- <dig> p <dig> was determined . il- <dig> p <dig> was first detected in the medium of transfected cells  <dig> hours after transfection. the maximum il- <dig> p <dig> concentration was observed  <dig> hours after transfection.

measurement of il- <dig> p <dig> secreted protein and mrna levels
 <dig> bhk- <dig> cells were transfected with different amounts of pgk-p <dig> plasmid. on the basis of the result of the time course analysis , media were collected after  <dig> hours and assayed by elisa. at this time the cells were harvested for the preparation of the cytoplasmic rna. figure 2a shows the relationship between il- <dig> p <dig> concentration in the medium and the amount of pgk-p <dig> used for transfection of bhk- <dig> cells. the amount of il- <dig> p <dig> secreted after transfection increased with the amount of the plasmid transfected up to  <dig> μg dna when it reached a plateau.

to correlate the p <dig> levels detected by elisa with transcription levels, qrt-pcr was performed on rna extracted from the transfected cells. the number of il- <dig> p <dig> transcripts were roughly proportional to the amount of transfected pgk-p <dig> plasmid . these results show that the amount of il- <dig> p <dig> secreted into the medium is directly proportional to the amount of the mrna present in the cells.

evaluation of relative promoter strength using egfp and il- <dig> p <dig> as reporter genes
the functional activity of the pgk and cmv promoters were compared by transfecting cmv-p <dig> and pgk-p <dig> constructs into bhk- <dig> and cos- <dig> cells. to measure the transfection efficiencies and compare extracellular il- <dig> p <dig> concentration to the intracellular egfp reporter in these experiments, the cmv-p <dig> and pgk-p <dig> constructs were cotransfected with cmv-egfp and pgk-egfp, respectively. egfp and il- <dig> p <dig> activities were measured after cotransfection of equal amounts of cmv-egfp and cmv-p <dig>  or pgk-egfp and pgk-p <dig>  the il- <dig> p <dig> expression was assayed by elisa sixteen hours after transfection. data obtained using  <dig> μl of media are shown . transfected cells were examined for egfp expression using the facscan flow cytometer. the egfp mean fluorescence intensity  was determined for each experiment and the results compared to the amounts of the il- <dig> p <dig> secreted into the medium. figure  <dig> shows that the difference between the strengths of the cmv and pgk promoters measured using egfp and il- <dig> p <dig> were similar. il- <dig> p <dig> was not detected in untransfected control cultures.

il- <dig> p <dig> as a reporter gene for bicistronic plasmids
the ires-based bicistronic vectors are powerful tools in molecular and cellular biology, because the expression of a reporter gene from the bicistronic message correlates well with the expression of the second gene  <cit> . we examined the expression of the il- <dig> p <dig> reporter protein driven by the encephalomyocarditis  ires element in bicistronic mrnas. the importance of this analysis is dictated by the observation that the expression levels of various cytokines and reporter genes in the second cistron of bicistronic mrnas is very low. this observation is interpreted in terms of negative effect that some sequences can exert on ires-mediated translation, regardless of the nature and sequence of the ires elements  <cit> . we analyzed the expression of the il- <dig> p <dig> in the second cistron of bicistronic mrnas whose transcription is driven by different promoters. the pgk and rosa <dig> promoters were cloned into pΔenh-ires-p <dig> to generate ppgk-ires-p <dig> and prosa-ires-p <dig>  respectively. to measure the transfection efficiency of the vectors and compare the il- <dig> p <dig> expression to a well-established reporter protein, the egfp coding sequence was inserted upstream to the ires element of the pcmv-ires-p <dig>  ppgk-ires-p <dig> and prosa-ires-p <dig>  and the resulting plasmids were named pcmv-egfp-ires-p <dig> ppgk-egfp-ires-p <dig> and prosa-egfp-ires-p <dig> . the first cistron, encoding egfp, will be translated by a cap-dependent mechanism, whereas the second cistron encoding il- <dig> p <dig> will require translation by ires. the above constructs were transfected into cos- <dig> cells, and egfp and il- <dig> p <dig> expression measured. il- <dig> p <dig> levels were normalized for transfection efficiency based on percentage of egfp positive cells. ires-mediated translation of extracellular il- <dig> p <dig> was proportional to the egfp mean fluorescence intensity  of the cos- <dig> cells transfected with pgk-egfp-ires-p <dig> and prosa-egfp-ires-p <dig> . this is consistent with the concept that il- <dig> p <dig> expression is proportional to the steady-state level of the bicistronic mrna. il- <dig> p <dig> expression from pcmv-egfp-ires-p <dig> was detectable but very low compared to the expression from ppgk-egfp-ires-p <dig> and prosa-egfp-ires-p <dig>  this is an unexpected result given the relatively high level of egfp mfi from pcmv-egfp-ires-p <dig>  and the identical egfp-ires-p <dig> structure in all three plasmids. because the plasmids differ only in their resident promoters, we would expect a similar rate of egfp to ires-dependent il- <dig> p <dig> translation in all three plasmids. this unexpected low il- <dig> p <dig> expression from cos- <dig> cells transfected with cmv-egfp-ires-p <dig> indicates that the cmv promoter likely exerts a negative effect on ires-mediated translation. to our knowledge, this is the first evidence of inhibitory activity of a promoter element on ires-mediated translation.

use of il- <dig> p <dig> as a reporter gene in a high-throughput screening strategy to identify successful transformed cells
the ease of accurately measuring il- <dig> p <dig> secreted from transfected es cells in culture prompted us to use the il- <dig> p <dig> to develop a high-throughput screening strategy to identify successfully modified mouse embryonic stem  cells. we chose to use the il- <dig> p <dig> as a reporter gene to rapidly identify transformed mouse embryonic stem cells expressing the reverse tetracycline controlled transactivator   <cit> . w <dig>  mouse embryonic stem cells were electroporated with pgk-rtta-ires-p <dig> and pgk-puromycin-resistance constructs. after puromycin selection for 8– <dig> days, fifty clones were transferred into individual wells of 48-well plates. after  <dig> days, the il- <dig> p <dig> concentration in the medium of transfected cells was assayed by elisa using  <dig> μl of the culture medium from  <dig> wells containing similar cell densities. all samples were run in duplicate. elisa assay showed relatively high il- <dig> p <dig> expression in five puromycin-resistant clones . out of  <dig> clones,  <dig>  contained rtta sequence, determined by pcr assay . therefore, 50% of rtta-containing clones expressed il- <dig> p <dig>  thus, the elisa procedure nicely identified those expressing cells out of those electroporated with pgk-rtta-ires-p <dig> 

analysis of the pluripotency of mouse es cells expressing the human il- <dig> p40
we investigated whether il- <dig> p <dig> expression compromises the pluripotent properties of the es cells. one of the clones expressing il- <dig> p <dig> was cultured in suspension in eb medium . these es cells expressing il- <dig> p <dig> are able to form embryoid bodies  in 3– <dig> days . following attachment and growth of these ebs in n <dig> medium for 5– <dig> days, cells with neuronal morphology began to appear within less than  <dig> days. after  <dig> days, most of the neurons were tubulin-positive, indicating that the expression of the il- <dig> p <dig> does not interfere with the ability of es cell to differentiate in vitro .

to determine the in vivo developmental potential of p40-expressing es cells, we used one high-expressing clone  to generate two female and four male chimeric mice. this es cell clone expressed a p <dig> protein at a level comparable to p40-expressing es clone  <dig> in figure  <dig> . four chimeras are shown in figure  <dig>  from the extensive amount of agouti fur in these mice, we estimated their overall es cell contribution to be greater than 80%. this p40-expressing es clone likely contributes to the developmental of all tissues of the mouse to a similar level  as seen in the fur. contribution to the germ lineage of one of the chimeras was confirmed by demonstrating the transmission of the ciita/p <dig> bicistronic construct to his offspring .

teratomas were generated from p40-expressing es cells to further demonstrate their pluripotency. teratomas were successfully produced from all lines tested . tissues derived from all three primary cell lineages  were seen in sections of teratomas from each of the  <dig> lines examined . we conclude from the aforementioned analyses that p40-expressing es cells are developmentally pluripotent, and that the expression of p <dig> protein has no adverse effect on the inherent pluripotency of mouse es cells.

discussion
standard methods to generate stable cell lines requires transfecting a host cell line with two expression cassettes: one expressing the gene of interest and the other expressing the antibiotic resistance marker, which can be placed together on the same vector or on two distinct vectors. the level of gene expression using such screening strategies cannot be predicted. clones expressing the gene of interest at high levels can be identified if the cells are transfected with a bicistronic construct containing the gene of interest and a reporter gene encoding for a visual or secreted reporter protein. we used the il- <dig> p <dig> reporter gene in gene delivery systems as a rapid and cost-effective high-throughput screening strategy to identify successfully transformed cells . the il- <dig> p <dig> secreted from the transfected cells can be assayed by elisa using a small aliquot of the culture medium. as little as  <dig>  pg/ml of il- <dig> p <dig> can be detected  <cit> . since there is no need to prepare cell lysate to measure il- <dig> p <dig> expression, the transfected cells can be utilized for further investigations. the absence of a cell lysis step decreases assay variability. we found that il- <dig> p <dig> has several features that make it a particularly attractive reporter gene when compared to another secreted protein which is being used widely, that is secreted alkaline phosphatase : i) the il- <dig> is produced by macrophages and dendritic cells only in response to antigenic stimulation. the restricted nature of expression of the il- <dig> permits the use of the p <dig> as a reporter protein in most mammalian cells. in contrast, the seap is not appropriate for cells derived from testes, cervix, and lung, as these have low levels of placental-type alkaline phospatase  <cit> ; ii) the cost of the il- <dig> p <dig> elisa kit is 3– <dig> times less than the seap assay kit; iii) high-throughput screening strategies based on the use of the il- <dig> p <dig> as reporter gene do not require special equipments, such as luminometer or spectrophotometer. interpretation of the il- <dig> p <dig> elisa assay can be simple and straightforward; comparison of the expression levels among different clones can be made by visual inspection, based on the color developed in the positive wells of the microplates during the last two steps of the assay; iv) expression of the human il- <dig> p <dig> does not compromise the developmental potential of mouse es cells.

recently, two secreted reporter proteins have been described: secreted gfp   <cit>  and gaussia luciferase   <cit> . however, lack of information does not allow us to compare these novel reporters with il- <dig> p <dig>  secgfp has been tested in plants but not in mammalian cells, and hgluc expression has not been analyzed in bicistronic mrnas. the latter point is crucial when a reporter gene is used to indirectly measure the expression of a gene of interest. ires-driven translation efficiency of the second cistron in bicistronic mrnas is influenced by the composition of both reading frames  <cit> . we therefore analyzed the ires-dependent il- <dig> p <dig> expression in bicistronic mrnas carrying three different upstream cistrons: egfp , rtta  and dominant negative ciita . in all cases, the il- <dig> p <dig> expression was efficient and independent of the composition of the first cistron.

il- <dig> p <dig> has advantages over the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase   <cit> , which is one of the most frequently used reporter proteins. recently, the common radioactive cat assay has been replaced by an elisa assay  <cit> . as cat is not a secreted protein, preparation of cell lysate is needed before measuring the cat protein by elisa. furthermore, the sensitivity of the cat elisa is approximately  <dig> pg/ml  <cit>  that is 15-fold less sensitive than il- <dig> p <dig>  furthermore, il- <dig> p <dig> offers a distinct advantage over the most widely used screening strategies that rely on the use of bicistronic vectors carrying a selection marker  after the ires element. this type of bicistronic vectors can become silent under non-selective conditions. although cell clones with homogenous transgene expression can be kept under selective conditions over a long period, this desirable phenotype can be progressively lost upon withdrawal of selective pressure  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
il- <dig> p <dig> is a sensitive reporter gene to measure molecular genetic events in most of the eukaryotic cell types. the protein assay is adaptable to applications that require sensitive quantification or simply 'yes' or 'no' determination of gene expression. like most commercially available reporter technologies, il- <dig> p <dig> is not versatile enough to be considered an "all purpose" reporter gene. for instance, like luciferase and seap, il- <dig> p <dig> cannot be used for fluorescence-activated cell sorting, or in vivo imaging gene expression analysis. however, the il- <dig> p <dig> reporter gene can be used as a rapid and cost-effective strategy in high-throughput screening to identify successful transformed cells. our study shows that il- <dig> p40-based screening of transfected mouse es cells offers improvement in cost, throughput, cell culture effort . high throughput screening of mouse es cells can be performed in any laboratory without the use of expensive automation systems.
