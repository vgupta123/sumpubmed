BACKGROUND

beauveria bassiana is a cosmopolitan entomopathogenic fungus  with a broad host range covering most insect orders  and also arthropods   <cit> . b. bassiana is currently used commercially as a biological control agent for different arthropod pests in china such as the pine caterpillar , corn borer , peach aphid , and pine sawyer   <cit> . b. bassiana is also being developed as a biological control tool for vectors of human diseases, such as anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria  <cit> , aedes aegypti mosquitoes that are vectors of dengue, chikungunya and zika virus  <cit> , the triatoma infestans bug, the chagas disease vector  <cit> , and ixodes ricinus ticks that transmit lyme disease  <cit> .

infection by b. bassiana starts when conidia adhere to the host cuticle via hydrophobic interactions and subsequently germinate. a germ tube is formed that is able to penetrate the cuticle through a combination of mechanical pressure and cuticle degrading enzymes. once the fungal structures reach the haemocoel, the fungus switches to growth as single-celled blastospores, which are capable of evading the insect immune system, exploit the haemolymph for nutrition, and secrete toxins that eventually kill the host. once the host is dead, the fungus breaches the cuticle from the inside outwards, allowing the formation of conidia that upon dispersal start new infections  <cit> .

a good understanding of the life history of b. bassiana as well as the genetic mechanisms of virulence is crucial to develop it as an effective and sustainable biological control agent. substantial progress has been made in the genetic characterization of the mechanisms involved in the infection cycle of b. bassiana inside insects. many of the recent findings regarding genes involved in virulence were possible due to the development of reliable protocols that allow genetic manipulation  <cit>  together with the availability of a draft genome sequence  <cit> . for instance, it has been found that b. bassiana expresses two hydrophobin genes, hyd <dig> and hyd <dig>  that are believed to be involved in surface hydrophobicity, adhesion, virulence and composition of the rodlet layer. a Δhyd <dig> knock-out mutant showed decreased virulence and spore hydrophobicity but unchanged surface adhesion, while a Δhyd <dig> mutant showed reduced hydrophobicity and surface adhesion but unchanged virulence  <cit> . similarly, a cytochrome p <dig> gene, bbcyp52x <dig>  was shown to function in enzymatic breakdown of lipids in the waxy layer. a Δbbcyp52x <dig> knock-out mutant showed reduced virulence on galleria mellonella upon topical application of conidia, though not upon intra-hemocoel injection  <cit> .

despite all efforts made to understand virulence in b. bassiana , many of the genes that were functionally analysed thus far are involved in general biological processes  that pleiotropically affect virulence. this indicates that virulence is tightly connected to the biology and life history of beauveria. in order to increase the efficacy and specificity of beauveria against arthropods, we need to identify the genes exclusively implicated in entomopathogenic virulence. therefore, strategies must be employed that allow de novo identification of genes and mechanisms specifically related to virulence. our previous identification of ample natural genetic variation for virulence in b. bassiana isolates  <cit>  opens the way for a comparative genomic approach. such an approach offers a powerful opportunity to collect comprehensive information of genetic variation and identification of variants of virulence and their evolutionary dynamics. importantly, knock-out mutant approaches are crucial and will play an important role in verifying the action of the candidate genes that emerge from comparative genomics of natural isolates that differ in virulence.

the aim of this study was to improve our knowledge in understanding the key factors involved in virulence of b. bassiana by a comparative genomics study. b. bassiana is well known for having a broad genetic, host, and virulence diversity. as a consequence, genome structure and dna sequence variation between any two isolates could be related to many factors in the biology of this fungus . therefore, we sequenced five isolates of contrasting virulence, selected from a panel of  <dig> b. bassiana isolates of which the natural variation in virulence had been previously characterized  <cit> . we assembled a gapless near-complete genome for the most virulent b. bassiana isolate, bb <dig>  which provides the community a highly suitable reference genome to be used for comparison with other isolates.

methods
fungal isolates and maintenance

beauveria bassiana isolates arsef  <dig> , arsef  <dig> , arsef  <dig> , arsef  <dig>  and arsef  <dig>  were obtained from the usda-ars collection of entomopathogenic fungal cultures . these isolates were selected based on their previously characterized virulence against malaria mosquitoes. isolates bb <dig> and bb <dig> were previously shown to display high virulence, bb <dig> has intermediate virulence, while bb <dig> and bb <dig> have low virulence  <cit> . isolates were grown on sabouraud dextrose agar with 1% yeast extract  at 27 °c before dna extraction and sequencing.

genome and transcriptome sequencing
dna was isolated from freeze-dried mycelium using a ctab-based method  <cit> . all isolates were sequenced with paired-end libraries of 180 bp insert size, and with a read length of 2x <dig> bp. isolates bb <dig>  bb <dig>  and bb <dig> were further sequenced with a mate-pair library of 10 kb  or 6 kb . isolate bb <dig> was selected as a reference based on the quality of the assembly, therefore additional sequencing focussed on this isolate and was performed using two pacbio smrt cells with an insert size of 20 kb. the paired-end and mate-pair sequencing were performed using illumina hiseq <dig> technology at the beijing genome institute . pacbio sequencing was performed using the rs ii instrument at keygene n.v. .

to obtain the transcriptome, rna from bb <dig> was isolated from three different sources:  5-day old mycelia grown on rice medium;  proto fruiting bodies  obtained from a cross between bb <dig> and bb <dig> co-cultivated for  <dig> months on rice medium as described  <cit> ; and  infected mosquitoes that had just died. rice medium was composed of 60 g of brown rice and 10 g of dried silkworm pupae, and 100 ml of distilled water. rna was isolated using a rnaeasy plant mini kit  following manufacturer’s recommendations and sequenced using a paired-end library of 180 bp insert size on an illumina hiseq <dig> platform at bgi.

genome assembly and annotation
for isolates bb <dig> and bb <dig>  de novo assembly was performed using celera assembler  <cit>  with default settings except k-mer size, which was set to  <dig>  isolates bb <dig>  bb <dig>  and bb <dig> were assembled using allpaths-lg  <cit>  with default settings. additionally, pacbio data was used to improve the assembly of bb <dig> using pbjelly  <cit>  and quiver tools  <cit> , and erroneously merged contigs were manually corrected. rna-seq libraries were assembled de novo with oases  <cit>  and trinity  <cit> . also, the rna-seq reads were mapped to the bb <dig> assembly using tophat  <cit> . completeness of the genome assemblies was assessed by the benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs  v <dig> b <dig> software tool  <cit> . repeatmasker  <cit>  was used to search for homologs of known repeats using the library from repbase  <cit> , and previously unknown repeats were predicted de novo with repeatscout  <cit> . local collinear blocks  were identifed using progressivemauve , with default settings. parsing and inversion detection was performed using a custom python script. genome annotation was performed using the maker  pipeline  <cit>  with augustus  <cit> , snap  <cit> , and genemark-es  <cit>  as ab initio gene predictors. the assembled rna-seq reads and all fungal proteins available in the uniprot database were used as evidence for gene prediction. furthermore, the predicted proteins were manually inspected and curated. the predicted proteins were functionally annotated using blastp  <cit>  against the non-redundant database of the national center of biotechnology information  and interproscan  <cit> . the blastp and interproscan results were imported into blast2go version  <dig>   <cit>  and gene ontology  terms were predicted. overrepresentation of go terms was analysed using fisher’s test as embedded in blast2go. secreted proteins were predicted by signalp  <dig>   <cit> .

pan-genome analysis
the pan-genomes and core genomes at the gene level were estimated using orthomcl  <cit>  implemented in get_homologues-est  <cit>  with e-value 1e− <dig> and 75% coverage. besides the five newly sequenced genomes presented here, the previously reported genome of b. bassiana arsef  <dig>   <cit>  was also included in the analysis.

phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic relationships were determined with the software realphy  <cit>  between all isolates of b. bassiana, including the previously sequenced isolate bb <dig>  <cit> , and using c. militaris  <cit>  as the outgroup of the tree. all genomes were mapped using bowtie <dig>  <cit>  on the genome of bb <dig> as a reference. after the alignment, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was inferred with raxml  <cit>  using the generalised time reversible  plus gamma nucleotide substitution model and  <dig> rapid bootstraps.

variant analysis
to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms , freebayes , a bayesian method based program, was used  <cit>  with a minimum alteration fraction of  <dig> . all sequences were mapped with bwa  <cit>  to the genome of isolate bb <dig>  to minimize false positives, snps called at positions with low coverage  were not considered. snp density and transition/transversion ratios were calculated using vcftools  <cit> .

secondary metabolite analysis
putative gene clusters that are predicted to be involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were identified using antismash  version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

mating type gene analysis
the presence of mating type loci in all isolates of b. bassiana  were identified by homology to characterized mat genes of other filamentous fungi using blastp. the mating type alleles mat1–1– <dig> and mat1–2– <dig> were also determined by pcr with the primer pairs mat <dig> f4/ mat <dig> r <dig> and mat <dig> f4/ mat <dig> r <dig>  <cit> , respectively.

selection analysis
to detect regions under positive selection, protein-coding dna alignments based on the orthologous genes were generated with paraat. ratios of non-synonymous  to synonymous  nucleotide substitution rates per site were estimated for each alignment using kaks_calculator  <dig>   <cit> . a sliding window of 100 bp was used with a gamma distribution  model.

RESULTS
a high-quality beauveria bassiana reference genome
five b. bassiana isolates were sequenced that were previously phenotyped for virulence against malaria mosquitoes. isolate bb <dig>  which is consistently the most virulent isolate in our collection  <cit>  was selected to serve as a high quality reference genome for the dataset. this isolate was sequenced with both short and long-reads, single molecule sequencing technology, while two isolates were sequenced with short reads on both short and long insert libraries , and two isolates were sequenced with short reads only on short insert libraries . the final assembly sizes were in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  mb, slightly larger  than the assembly of the previously sequenced isolate of b. bassiana, bb <dig>  <cit> . the final assemblies resulted in  <dig> to  <dig>  contigs , and the five isolates were predicted to encode between  <dig>  and  <dig>  protein-coding genes. the genome assembly of isolate bb <dig> had only  <dig> contigs with an n <dig> contig length of  <dig>  mb, and there were no gaps present. the  <dig> contigs covering the genome of bb <dig> represent four full chromosomes  and  <dig> chromosome ends with a single telomeric repeat.table  <dig> summary of the genomic features of the different b. bassiana isolates

the three highest quality assemblies  were used to explore structural rearrangements between these three genomes. in total,  <dig> locally collinear blocks  were shared between two or three genomes. we identified  <dig> cases of clear inversions, where three adjacent lcbs were shared between the three genomes and in one genome the middle block was inverted with respect to the others. fifteen of these inversions occurred in strain bb <dig> , while two inversions occurred in bb <dig> and one in bb <dig>  the size of inverted regions ranged from ~1 kb to 220 kb. some lcbs demonstrated significant size differences between the genomes , suggesting insertions or deletions. two inversions in isolate bb <dig> occurred within the coding sequence of a predicted gene , thereby truncating the coding sequence of that gene in bb <dig>  the vast majority of inversions occurred outside coding sequences and were judged to have no impact on gene structure or regulatory regions.

the completeness of all five genomes was assessed by checking for the representation of a set of universal single-copy orthologs for fungi  <cit> , and this analysis indicated that each genome had at least 96% of the total buscos , suggesting a high quality of all the assemblies. the pan-genome is here defined as the combination of all the genes that are present in the genomes of all isolates of a particular species, and it includes the core genes, dispensable genes, and isolate-specific genes  <cit> . a pan-genome analysis for b. bassiana for the five isolates sequenced in this study in combination with the previously sequenced isolate bb <dig>  <cit> , indicated that the core genome of b. bassiana consists of  <dig>  orthologous gene clusters . on the other hand, the pan-genome consists of  <dig>  orthologous gene clusters .fig.  <dig> pan-genome analysis of b. bassiana isolates. a estimation of the b. bassiana core genome, in which the number of shared genes is plotted as a function of the number of isolates sequentially added. b estimation of b. bassiana pan-genome size, in which the numbers of all genes are plotted as a function of the number of isolates sequentially added




high levels of genetic diversity as revealed by snps and phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic relationships between isolates of b. bassiana were determined using the whole genome. two distinct clusters were formed , designated  <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> contains three isolates , while the other three isolates  are grouped in cluster  <dig>  the grouping did not reflect a geographical distribution: the two isolates originating from usa were assigned to different clusters, as well as the two isolates of european origin. in addition, the two clusters did not reflect distinct virulence levels, as the low virulence isolate  grouped with the two high virulence isolates in cluster  <dig> fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree based on whole genome assemblies of the different isolates of b. bassiana, with c. militaris as the outgroup to root the tree. on the right, the different clusters found are highlighted




all the read data that were available in this study were mapped to bb <dig> as a reference in order to detect snps. within cluster  <dig>  there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps per kb for isolates bb <dig> and bb <dig>  respectively. in contrast, the genetic variation in isolates from cluster  <dig> against bb <dig> was four-fold higher, with an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps per kb, for bb <dig> and bb <dig>  respectively. similarly, the genetic identity to respect to bb <dig> was higher in bb <dig>  and bb <dig> , and lower in bb <dig>  and bb <dig> . we searched for snps in coding sequences of a set of  <dig> genes that have been functionally analysed by knock-out mutagenesis  between the five b. bassiana isolates sequenced in this study. there are two genes that contain a snp with potentially high impact: in the α-glucoside transporter gene bbagt <dig> in a single isolate, and in the thioredoxin gene trx <dig> in two isolates. the remaining  <dig> genes do not display any high impact snps.

a new mating type gene
analysis of orthologous relationships between the genes of all isolates of b. bassiana in this study identified the presence of several mating type loci . we identified two mat genes, mat1–1– <dig> and mat1–1– <dig>  in bb <dig> and bb <dig>  the mat1–1– <dig> gene was not previously identified in the published genome of bb <dig>  <cit> , but based on blast hits, genes from bb <dig> and bb <dig> have homology to the mat1–1– <dig> gene in c. militaris  <cit> . further alignment of the putative mat1–1– <dig> gene from bb <dig> and bb <dig> to scaffold bba_s <dig> from bb <dig> confirmed that this gene is also present in bb <dig> but was not characterized  <cit> . the mat1- <dig> locus was identified by homology to the hmg-box domain in bb <dig>  bb <dig> and bb <dig>  a putative new mat gene was found next to the mat1–2– <dig> gene. blastp analysis and sequence alignments shows that it has partial homology to the newly described mat1–2– <dig> gene in villosiclava virens  <cit> . pcr confirmed presence of either mat1–1– <dig> or mat1–2– <dig> in each isolate .fig.  <dig> graphical presentation of the synteny of mating type genes and their flanking region in b. bassiana genomes. genes in the same colour show orthologous relationships. the dashed circle represents a gene that has not previously been identified in the genome of arsef 2860




the draft genome of b. bassiana isolate bb <dig> was reported to lack the spo <dig> gene, a meiosis-specific topoisomerase essential for meiotic recombination, and this observation was used as an explanation for the infrequent occurrence of the sexual cycle of b. bassiana  <cit> . the spo <dig> gene was however present in the genomes of all five b. bassiana isolates analysed in this study, and the conclusion about its absence in b. bassiana  <cit> , based on a draft genome assembly, was thus erroneous.

isolate-specific genes from bb <dig> include candidate virulence genes
isolate bb <dig> was previously characterized as the most virulent towards malaria mosquitoes  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesised that the high virulence could be due to the presence of genes unique to bb <dig> that are related to fungal virulence. in order to detect regions uniquely present in bb <dig>  all reads from the four other isolates were mapped to the genome of bb <dig>  and regions with very low or no read coverage were detected . a total sequence length of  <dig>  mb  displayed very low coverage in the four other isolates, these regions encompassed  <dig> genes. to independently verify whether these genes were indeed unique, raw reads of the four other isolates were then mapped to individual genes of bb <dig>  this approach identified  <dig> genes from bb <dig> with low or no coverage in all four other isolates. comparison of the two datasets yielded  <dig> genes that were identified by both methods , which we therefore considered to be unique to isolate bb <dig>  the location of these bb <dig> genes on the eight largest contigs was analysed. interestingly, the genes showed a tendency to cluster together, especially close to telomeres . the unique bb <dig> genes were functionally annotated to evaluate their potential role in pathogenicity. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig>  have homology to genes in the pathogen host interaction database   <cit> ,  <dig>  were hypothetical proteins, and  <dig>  were predicted to contain signal peptides. both the number of genes classified as hypothetical proteins and those predicted to be secreted were higher than expected when compared to the complete gene content . by contrast, the number of genes homologous to genes represented in phi-base follows the expectation based on the whole gene set . an overrepresentation of gene ontology terms was not detected in the  <dig> genes that are unique to bb <dig> fig.  <dig> circular visualization of the alignment of genome sequencing reads of four isolates of beauveria bassiana with respect to the bb <dig> reference assembly. the eight largest contigs are numbered  <dig> to  <dig> along the perimeter of the outer circle. the tracks represent the location of predicted genes for bb <dig> ; mean read coverage  for isolates bb <dig> , bb <dig> , bb <dig>  and bb <dig> ; and location of the unique genes for bb <dig> . in tracks  to , colours represent the percentage of coverage against the bb <dig> reference assembly: red: 0–45%, orange: 45–63%, yellow: 63–77%, green: 77–90%, and blue: 90–100%)




secondary metabolites play a role in fitness and virulence of fungal pathogens  <cit> . a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  gene cluster is present in the unique gene set of bb <dig> at the start of contig  <dig>  the nrps gene  has homology  to several metarhizium species, with the difference that bb8028_0008g <dig> has a single adenylation domain and is  <dig> amino acids in length, while its metarhizium homologs possess two adenylation domains and encode proteins almost double in size. in addition, bb <dig> contains a unique polyketide synthase gene .

five genes unique to bb <dig>  encode proteins possessing bacterial enterotoxin-like domains. four of these contain a heat-labile enterotoxin domain  while one protein displays 54% similarity to the vibrio cholera enterotoxin alpha chain domain . outside the kingdom eubacteria, these enterotoxin genes have homology almost exclusively to beauveria, cordyceps and metarhizium species, all of which are entomopathogenic fungi . bb <dig> also possesses  <dig> peptidase genes  that have no orthologs in any of the other four b. bassiana isolates. furthermore, two genes encoding the enzyme cyanamide hydratase are uniquely present in bb <dig>  cyanamide hydratase converts cyanamide into urea, and has been studied in relation to fungal survival in the soil since cyanamide is used as a fertilizer and is also synthesized by vetch species  <cit> . bb <dig> also contains  <dig> unique genes involved in transport processes, of which five belong to the major facilitator  superfamily, four to the family of atp-binding cassette  transporters, and the remaining four are dedicated siderophore and dicarboxylate transporters, as well as a sodium/proton antiporter. abc transporters can be involved in  resistance to fungicides, as well as the secretion of antibiotics and toxins  <cit> . recently, five abc transporters were characterized in b. bassiana and found to be implicated in fungicide resistance, oxidative stress tolerance, and in virulence  <cit> .

finally, among the gene set unique to bb <dig> are also genes encoding enzymes putatively involved in the modification of chromatin proteins, which may modulate changes in gene expression  <cit> . specifically, these genes encode three arginine deiminases and a putative histone arginine n-methyltransferase.

although a detailed analysis of differential gene expression could not be done with the rna data available due to the lack of sample replication, an exploratory examination was done to see whether unique genes of bb <dig> were highly expressed. specifically, we looked for genes that had at least  double the expression ) in the library isolated from infected mosquitoes compared against the library from fruiting bodies or mycelia, and,  a value of at least one fpkm. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes fulfilled these criteria. notably, three of the five genes annotated as a toxin were among these  <dig> genes . also one of the arginine deiminase genes and one of the cyanamide hydratase genes displayed a high expression in the mosquito library as compared to the other two libraries.

no clear pattern of positive selection in genes of bb8028
genes with a signature of positive selection may contribute to the adaptation to a changing environment and could be related to virulence. therefore, we investigated whether genes were under positive selection in bb <dig>  ka/ks ratios were calculated in pairwise comparisons between orthologs in bb <dig> and each of the four other isolates, separately. we detected  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> genes of bb <dig> with ka/ks >  <dig> when compared to their orthologs in bb <dig>  bb <dig>  bb <dig>  bb <dig>  respectively. in total,  <dig> genes are considered to be under selection in bb <dig>  but intriguingly no gene was shared among the four pairwise comparisons . among the genes under positive selection are two calmodulin-dependent protein kinase genes and an abc transporter gene, while most of the other genes were of unknown function.

discussion
in this study, we provide and compare the genomes of five isolates of b. bassiana that were previously characterized in a large-scale analysis of virulence against the malaria mosquito   <cit> . these isolates have different levels of virulence, with bb <dig> being the most virulent isolate, followed by bb <dig>  bb <dig>  bb <dig>  and finally bb <dig>  comparative genomics at the intraspecific level is an approach to determine the genetic basis of phenotypic variations detected between different isolates. the genome of b. bassiana was previously compared to other entomopathogenic fungi  <cit> , and in order to avoid a duplication of this previous work, we focused on comparison between b. bassiana isolates, with an emphasis on bb <dig>  a pan-genome analysis indicated that the core genome of b. bassiana consists of  <dig>  orthologous gene clusters, while the pan-genome consists of  <dig>  orthologous gene clusters. these numbers suggest that b. bassiana has an open pan-genome, as may be expected for a species that can typically colonize multiple environments  <cit> .

the isolates analysed have a high level of diversity with  <dig>  snps between bb <dig> and bb <dig>  and  <dig>  snps between bb <dig> and bb <dig>  previous studies have suggested that b. bassiana is not monophyletic, but rather is composed of several clusters that are morphologically identical  <cit> . one study  <cit>  described seven phylogenetic clusters in b. bassiana that consisted of isolates which did not show any geographic distribution but had common climate characteristics, while a different study  <cit>  described isolates that were distributed in five clusters in a particular hedgerow habitat, however, genetic distances were not determined on a genome-wide scale in these studies. a comparative genomic study of seven isolates of the plant pathogenic fungus penicillium expansum revealed a genetic diversity between  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps/kb  <cit> , while between two isolates of aspergillus niger it was  <dig>  snps/kb  <cit> . in both these cases, the genetic diversity was lower than observed in this study . the finding that b. bassiana possesses a high genetic diversity seems to be in agreement with the earlier suggestions that b. bassiana is not monophyletic  <cit>  and warrants further studies to elucidate the species phylogeny on a whole genome scale.


b. bassiana normally reproduces asexually, and for a long time it was believed to be exclusively clonal. developmental and phylogenetic studies, however, have linked it to the teleomorph cordyceps bassiana  <cit> . in the five isolates studied, the mat1- <dig> and mat1- <dig> loci were identified based on homology to the typical fungal mating type genes, encoding the alpha domain protein and the high mobility group box domain, respectively. the presence of either of two distinct alleles of the mat locus in each b. bassiana isolate indicates that the species is putatively heterothallic. a new mat gene was detected next to the mat1–2– <dig> gene which, based on homology to a newly described gene in villosiclava virens  <cit> , is referred to as mat1–2– <dig> following the nomenclature proposed by dyer et al.  <cit> . we attempted to sexually cross different isolates of b. bassiana in several combinations to generate fertile fruiting bodies. based on the mating type, six combinations were possible . unfortunately, none of the crosses generated ascospores, but the cross between bb <dig> and bb <dig> generated fruiting body-like structures without ascospores; these structures were used to generate a transcriptome library. when taking into consideration the phylogenetic clusters found, we realized that only bb <dig> and b <dig> belong to the same cluster and had the lowest number of snps/kb, compared to the other possible combinations. since b. bassiana could be polyphyletic, and reports have found a single mating type in several populations  <cit> , it is not surprising that b. bassiana is limited mainly to asexual reproduction. it is worthwhile to invest in a reproducible protocol for sexual crosses under laboratory conditions. the ability to achieve sexual reproduction will enable genome-wide association studies  of quantitative virulence in the offspring of two isolates that markedly differ in virulence, for instance bb <dig> and bb <dig> 

in this analysis, we identified a suite of genes that are unique to bb <dig>  among these are a pks gene and a gene cluster comprising an nrps gene with homology to a m. anisopliae gene annotated as tyrocidine synthase . tyrocidine has antibiotic activity, and the peptide synthesized by the nrps gene product could thus have antibiotic activity. the set of genes unique to bb <dig> also comprised five genes encoding bacterial-like toxins and  <dig> transporter genes. the b. bassiana genome contains many more bacterial-like toxins than most other fungi  <cit> . interestingly, we found preliminary evidence that some of the bacterial-like toxins are highly expressed in fungal infection of mosquitoes. a recent study  <cit>  analysed gene expression in b. bassiana arsef  <dig> infecting plutella xylostella larvae at three different time points after inoculation . in the latter study, an enrichment of genes with functions in antioxidant activity, peroxidase activity, and proteolysis was detected among the genes that are highly expressed in b. bassiana during infection of the host insect. in contrast, toxin genes were not reported to be highly expressed during infection of p. xylostella larvae  <cit> . the mortality rate of p. xylostella larvae infected by b. bassiana at 48 h was 33%, which is much lower than the mortality rate of almost 100% of infected mosquitoes at the time that we sampled rna for library construction. the infection cycle of b. bassiana is a complex process which includes several developmental transitions that require an intricate genetic regulation  <cit> . this biological complexity may explain why no overlap is found between these studies. furthermore, b. bassiana is capable of infecting a wide range of hosts that have different chemical and physical compositions, which most likely requires a tailored response for each host-pathogen interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
the availability of a near-complete genome assembly of bb <dig> provided with a manually curated gene set, adds significant value to the previously published draft genome of b. bassiana  <cit> . as argued by  <cit> , a high quality assembly including proper assembly of centromeres, telomeres, and other repetitive elements provides the ability to characterize structural rearrangements and facilitates a better identification of secondary metabolite gene clusters. therefore, a high quality genome is a key step to uncover the biological complexity of an organism, as our analyses showed. the bb <dig> genome assembly represents a significant resource for future research into the biology of this entomopathogenic fungus and its relevance as a biological control agent. understanding the key factors involved in virulence of b. bassiana will improve our methods to use this fungus as an effective and sustainable biological control agent against, amongst others, vectors of human diseases.
