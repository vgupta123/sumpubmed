BACKGROUND
hyperactivation of the pi3k-akt pathway is one of the most common molecular findings in human malignancies  <cit> . constitutive activation of this pathway can result from several factors, including mutation and/or amplification in certain components within this pathway, e.g., egfr, erbb <dig>  pi3k, and akt as well as the downregulation or loss of negative regulators such as the serine phosphatase, pten  <cit> . increased akt <dig> activity has been observed in approximately 40% of breast and ovarian cancers and >50% of prostate carcinomas. activation of akt <dig> kinase has been observed in 30-40% of ovarian and pancreatic cancers  <cit> . increased akt <dig> enzymatic activity was found in estrogen receptor-deficient breast cancer and androgen insensitive prostate cancer cell lines, suggesting that akt <dig> may contribute to the aggressiveness of steroid hormone-insensitive cancers  <cit> . akt signaling has been reported to promote cell survival and proliferation across different cell types and can involve multiple downstream mechanisms including activation of frap <dig> /p70s6k <dig>  inactivation of cdkn1b , inactivation of forkhead family transcription factors, and increased cyclin d <dig> . in breast cancer cells, the anti-proliferative function of the pten tumor suppressor protein has been demonstrated to involve the inhibition of akt-mediated cell cycle activation through both its protein and more canonical lipid phosphatase activities and the function of the cdkn1b cell cycle inhibitor has been shown to be directly inhibited by akt-dependent phosphorylation  <cit> . in ovarian cancer cells, pi3k/akt signaling has been demonstrated to affect cell proliferation via frap1/p70s6k1-mediated mechanisms  <cit> . proliferation of embryonic cardiomyocytes in cell culture has been demonstrated to be dependent on pi3k/akt signaling leading to inhibition of the activity of the forkhead family transcription factors, foxo1a and foxo3a  <cit> . in rat and mouse cell lines, myc-induced proliferation and transformation was shown to require akt-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of forkhead family proteins.

akt provides survival signals through inhibiting several proapoptotic factors in the caspase cascade, including bad, caspase- <dig>  pea <dig> , cdkn1a , and map3k <dig>   <cit> . akt also regulates apoptosis by providing positive and negative transcriptional signaling. phosphorylation of foxo by akt prevents its nuclear entry and thereby preventing transcription of proapoptotic genes, including fas ligand, bim, trail and tradd. in contrast  <cit> , akt promotes nuclear translocation of nf-κb by phosphorylating and activating iκb kinase , leading to the phosphorylation and proteosomal degradation of iκb , and ultimately nf-κb nuclear localization. akt can also inactivate p <dig> by modulating subcellular localization of mdm <dig>  phosphorylation of mdm <dig> by akt is necessary for localization to the nucleus, where mdm <dig> can complex with p <dig> to promote its ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation  <cit> .

the present study investigated mechanisms induced in cancer cell lines in response to treatment with gsk <dig>  an atp-competitive, pan-akt kinase inhibitor with potent enzyme and cellular activity being investigated in patients with solid tumor and hematological malignancies  <cit> . the goal of this study was to identify mechanisms that were common to a set of cell lines sensitive to gsk <dig> and to evaluate those mechanisms for their potential effects on cell survival and proliferation. candidate mechanisms were identified via analysis of gene expression profiling data and phosphoproteomic data using a causal network modeling methodology called "reverse causal analysis"   <cit> . rca enables the mechanistic interpretation of large datasets using a large network model of biological cause and effect relationships. in rca, the causal network upstream from entities observed to change in the experiment  is automatically evaluated to identify and rank many thousands of subnetworks that express potential mechanistic explanations for the observed changes. biologists using rca methodology can then construct a causal network model  where multiple mechanism networks and their supporting evidence are merged to form a unified causal network consistent with the input datasets. the cnm represents the set of hypotheses explaining the observed changes. the cnm in the present study is further constrained to contain only those subnetworks that are supported by the observed changes in all sensitive cell lines: it represents the common set of hypotheses for mechanisms of sensitivity to gsk <dig> 

RESULTS
inhibition of cellular akt activity by gsk690693
gsk <dig> inhibits proliferation of certain tumor cell lines in vitro and attenuates the growth of human tumor xenografts in mice  <cit> . to investigate the molecular cascade leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation by gsk <dig>  various tumor cell lines growing in cell culture or as xenografts in mice were treated with vehicle or gsk <dig>  cell lines used in this study were either classified as sensitive to gsk <dig> : t47d, bt <dig>  and lncap or less sensitive : mda-mb- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  and skov <dig>  <cit> . daily treatment of mice with gsk <dig> inhibited growth of bt <dig>  lncap, and skov <dig> tumor xenografts  <cit> . microarray analysis was used to generate rna profiles for the cell culture experiments  as well as for the xenograft experiments . changes in the phosphorylation of various proteins following gsk <dig> treatment were analyzed for the bt <dig>  t47d, mda-mb- <dig>  and mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells in cell culture using reverse phase protein array . treatment with gsk <dig> resulted in a decrease in the abundance of phosphorylated akt substrates, pgsk3a/b , pfkhr/fkhrl <dig> , pmtor , pbad , and ppras <dig>  in bt <dig>  t47d, mda-mb- <dig>  and mda-mb- <dig> cells , providing direct evidence for the inhibition of akt kinase activity by gsk <dig>  causal network modeling was used to identify chains of causation linking the upstream perturbation to downstream hypotheses identified by rca incorporating phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic changes as evidence. for example the observed decrease in gsk3b and frap <dig> phosphorylations support decreased myc activity in response to akt inhibition.

akt inhibition can increase transcriptional activity of foxo1a and foxo3a
akt directly phosphorylates foxo1a and foxo3a at t24/s <dig> and t32/s <dig>  respectively, excluding the proteins from the nucleus and effectively inhibiting their transcriptional activities  <cit> . thus, inhibition of akt by gsk <dig> can increase foxo transcriptional activity, by decreasing its phosphorylation. decreased phosphorylation of foxo1a/foxo3a was observed in the bt <dig>  t47d, mda-mb- <dig>  and mda-mb- <dig> cell culture experiments after treatment with gsk <dig> . rca of rna expression changes supports increased transcriptional activity of foxo3a in all three xenografts and foxo1a in two of the three xenografts . rca of rna expression changes supports the increased transcriptional activity of both foxo1a and foxo3a in the bt <dig>  t47d, skov- <dig>  and lncap cells treated in culture . there is approximately a 50% overlap between the rna expression changes explained by the two foxo family members, and collectively they explain  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rna expression changes observed after three days of drug treatment in bt <dig>  skov- <dig>  and lncap xenografts, respectively . increased transcriptional activity of foxo1a and foxo3a also explains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> transcriptional changes in bt <dig>  t47d, skov- <dig>  and lncap cultured cells, respectively  . increased transcriptional activity of foxo1a and foxo3a is not supported by rca in the two cell lines less sensitive to gsk <dig> mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells . increased nuclear translocation of a foxo3--green florescent protein hybrid in response to gsk <dig> treatment in u2os cells has been shown previously, in confirmation of these results  <cit> .

decreased myc transcriptional activity
rca identifies rna expression changes that strongly support decreased transcriptional activity of myc in all three xenografts as well as in four sensitive tumor cell lines in culture. inhibition of akt can lead to decreased transcriptional activity of myc through multiple mechanisms. decreased myc activity can correctly explain  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rna expression changes in the bt <dig>  skov- <dig>  and lncap xenografts, respectively . decreased myc activity is also supported by rna expression changes in bt <dig> and t47d ,,skov- <dig>  and lncap cultured cells at  <dig> hours . decreased transcriptional activity of myc is not supported by rca in the mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells .

although myc rna levels are not observed to be significantly changed in any cell line at any time point following drug treatment , multiple mechanisms can link akt inhibition to decreased myc protein abundance and transcriptional activity. in the skov- <dig> cell culture experiment, evidence supporting decreased myc activity is observed as early as two hours after treatment  and in the lncap cell culture experiment at eight hours after treatment, consistent with fast, post-translational control of myc. akt directly phosphorylates gsk3β leading to inhibition of its kinase activity, and decreased gsk3β phosphorylation is observed in response to akt inhibition by gsk <dig> treatment . active gsk3β phosphorylates myc at residue t <dig>  thereby targeting myc for degradation by fbxw <dig>  <cit> . akt phosphorylates frap <dig>  at s <dig> increasing frap <dig> kinase activity, and decreased frap <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation was observed in the breast cancer cell lines   <cit> . additionally, akt directly phosphorylates akt1s <dig> , and this phosphorylation acts to block the inhibitory binding of akt1s <dig> to frap <dig>  <cit> . decreased phosphorylation of akt1s <dig> at t <dig> was observed in all four breast cancer cell lines in response to gsk <dig> treatment . increased frap <dig> activity can lead to increased activity of eif4e, a translation initiation factor that directly increases myc translation, decreasing frap <dig> activity that could result in decreased protein abundance of myc  <cit> .

foxo3a/foxo1a transcriptional activities can inhibit the induction of multiple myc target genes  <cit>  and can upregulate the expression of specific cell cycle-inhibitory genes that are also downregulated by myc activity, such as hbp <dig>  ccng <dig>  and cdkn1b. rna expression of these three genes was increased in multiple cell culture and xenograft experiments, consistent with increased foxo1a/foxo3a and decreased myc transcriptional activity .

proteins of the mad family are another potential regulator of myc activity  <cit> . transcript levels of mxi <dig>  a mad family member that inhibits myc activity, were observed to be increased in response to gsk <dig> treatment in skov- <dig>  bt <dig>  and lncap cell culture experiments and in bt <dig> xenografts . this is consistent with recent findings in dld- <dig> colon carcinoma cells in which akt <dig> silencing resulted in increased foxo3a activity leading to increased mxi <dig> rna expression  <cit> .

decreased tfrc activity
rca identified rna expression changes that support decreased tfrc activity in skov- <dig> and lncap xenografts and in t47d, skov- <dig>  and lncap cultured cells . increased akt activity can increase tfrc cell surface expression, leading to increased tfrc activation  <cit> . tfrc has recently been reported to be a direct transcriptional target of myc, and tfrc was shown to be required for myc-mediated cell proliferation  <cit> , providing a direct mechanism by which akt can mediate tfrc cell surface expression. tfrc rna levels were decreased in response to treatment in the skov- <dig> xenograft, and in bt <dig>  skov- <dig>  and lncap cell culture experiments . decreased tfrc activity explains  <dig> and  <dig> rna expression changes in the skov- <dig> and lncap three day xenografts, respectively. decreased tfrc activity also explains  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rna expression changes in t47d, skov- <dig>  and lncap cultured cells . decreased tfrc activity is not supported by rca in the mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells .

rb1-mediated g <dig> cell cycle arrest
rca identifies rna expression changes that support increased cell cycle arrest in all three xenografts and rna expression and phosphoprotein changes that support increased cell cycle arrest in bt <dig>  t47d, skov- <dig>  and lncap cultured cells . rna expression changes strongly support an increase in cell cycle arrest based on evidence for increased activity of cell cycle suppressors cdkn1a, rb <dig>  and e2f <dig>  and decreased activity of cell cycle activators e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  and e2f <dig> .

rb <dig> is a cell cycle regulatory protein that can inhibit the g1/s transition  <cit>  and the m/g <dig> transition  <cit> . the activation of rb1-mediated transcription and its effects on this regulatory network by gsk <dig> can collectively explain  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rna expression changes in the bt <dig>  skov- <dig>  and lncap xenografts, respectively, at three days. the activation of rb <dig> also explains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rna expression changes in the bt <dig>  t47d, skov- <dig>  and lncap cell cultures . the activation of rb <dig> is not supported in the mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells .

akt inhibition can lead to rb <dig> activation and cell cycle arrest through multiple independent mechanisms including activation of the cell cycle inhibitor cdkn1a  <cit> . akt can directly phosphorylate cdkn1a inhibiting the activity of this protein by secluding it in the cytoplasm  <cit> . increased cdkn1a activity due to akt inhibition is strongly supported by  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rna expression changes in the bt <dig>  skov- <dig>  and lncap xenograft three day experiments, respectively. increased cdkn1a activity also explains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rna expression changes in the bt <dig>  t47d, skov- <dig>  and lncap cell culture experiments, but is not supported in the mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cell culture experiments .

the e2f family of transcription factors regulates cell cycle progression, with the activities of e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  and e2f <dig> promoting cell cycle progression and the activity of e2f <dig> inhibiting cell cycle progression  <cit> . decreased e2f <dig> transcriptional activity is supported by rna expression changes in all three xenograft experiments  as well as in cultured cells  . decreased transcriptional activity of e2f <dig> and e2f <dig>  and increased transcriptional activity of e2f <dig> are supported by rna expression changes in all three xenografts and bt <dig>  t47d, skov- <dig>  and lncap cells . increased transcriptional activity of e2f <dig> and decreased transcriptional activities of e2f <dig>  e2f <dig>  and e2f <dig> are not supported by rca in the mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells .

distinct sets of gene expression changes support the same hypotheses, and the hypotheses form a causal network model providing a mechanism that links akt inhibition with reduced proliferation
as represented in figure  <dig>  three very distinct sets of rna expression changes were identified in response to gsk <dig> treatment in three xenograft experiments. seventeen rna expression changes were common to all three xenograft experiments. however, the hypotheses of increased foxo activity, increased cell cycle arrest, decreased myc transcriptional activity, and decreased tfrc activity correctly explain 31%, 26%, and 31% of the rna expression changes in each of the three xenograft experiments , respectively. similar explanatory power of these hypotheses is seen in the cell culture experiments, in which 33%, 50%, 45%, and 32% of rna expression changes were correctly explained in bt <dig>  t47d, skov <dig>  and lncap cells, respectively. in contrast to the small overlap in rna expression changes, the four mechanisms supporting gsk <dig> driven anti-proliferative effects identified by rca form a causal network model that can correctly explain a large portion of the rna expression changes identified in each xenograft and cell culture experiment . the power of causal analysis is exemplified by the expression changes related to two cell cycle marker genes, pcna and mki <dig>  although the increased cell cycle arrest hypothesis was well supported in all experiments, changes in these two genes failed to meet significance criteria in one or more of the xenograft experiments. each of the four mechanisms is well supported by rna expression changes from each xenograft and cell culture experiment; however the specific expression patterns supporting the mechanisms are minimally overlapping.

discussion
the akt family of kinases has been well characterized as a mediator of cell proliferation and survival, and these functionalities highlight the role of these kinases in tumor progression  <cit> . in this study, we characterized molecular signaling networks that are activated or inhibited by akt inhibition by gsk <dig> treatment using gene microarray data from multiple cell lines and xenograft models and phosphoproteomics analysis from multiple cell lines.

the focus of this analysis was to identify common mechanisms of action for gsk <dig> treatment in breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer cell lines in both cell culture and xenograft models. rca enabled the analysis of large, transcriptomic data sets in combination with a more targeted phosphoproteomics data set to identify mechanisms of action for this akt inhibitor that were supported by specific rna expression and phosphoprotein changes following gsk <dig> treatment.

treatment with gsk <dig> inhibited the kinase activity of akt, and led to alterations in multiple downstream signaling pathways . the four hypotheses identified by rca form a causal network model in which inhibition of akt leads to cell cycle arrest and inhibition of proliferation . the increased transcriptional activity of foxo1a and foxo3a can directly increase the expression of cell cycle inhibitors, such as hbp <dig>  ccng <dig>  and cdkn1b, and these genes were upregulated in the majority of the sensitive cell culture and xenograft experiments . the expression of these three genes is repressed through the activity of myc. the pro-proliferative effect of myc activation is well established  <cit> , and repression of the transcriptional activity of this protein, which was supported by rca, would lead to decreased cell proliferation . tfrc is a myc-regulated gene that was observed to be decreased in response to gsk <dig> treatment in some of the cell lines and xenografts. furthermore, decreased protein abundance of tfrc was supported by rca, and tfrc cell surface expression has been shown to be greater in cancer cells than in normal cells  <cit>  and a positive correlation has been reported between the number of cell surface transferrin receptors and the rate of cell proliferation  <cit> . inhibition of tfrc decreases cell proliferation and results in g <dig> arrest, consistent with the tumor growth inhibition observed in the sensitive cell culture and xenograft experiments . akt inhibition can also directly stimulate cell cycle arrest through attenuation of the direct inhibitory akt-mediated phosphorylation of the cell cycle inhibitors cdkn1a and cdkn1b, as well as through modulation of the activity of the signaling intermediate gsk3β . in combination, these four hypotheses describe a mechanism for inhibition of proliferation due to akt inhibition, primarily through cell cycle arrest and identified inhibition of proliferation, as opposed to the more canonical survival role attributed to akt signaling, as the primary process responsible .

akt activation results in both anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative signals, although the evidence for induction of apoptosis was generally lacking or weak in our study with the akt kinase inhibitor, suggesting that akt plays a more critical role in regulating cell proliferation in epithelial cancer cells. this is in contrast to findings in lymphoblastic leukemia cells lines treated with gsk <dig> in which caspase 3/ <dig> induction and concomitant increased sub-2n populations were observed in addition to decreased proliferation  <cit> . treatment with gsk <dig> resulted in increased foxo1a and foxo3a transcriptional activity, although the transcript levels of pro-apoptotic genes  were not consistently upregulated in most of the cell culture and xenograft models. similarly, causal analysis did not identify change in the nf-κb transcriptional activity in any of the model systems upon treatment with gsk <dig>  further, phosphorylation of bad was decreased in cells treated with gsk <dig> , suggesting regulation of apoptotic pathways. although there was some evidence of apoptosis in lncap and bt <dig> cells at 24- <dig> h , the other cell lines did not show evidence of this process. taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of akt kinases can regulate both cell proliferation and apoptotic pathways. this is consistent with previous findings that gsk <dig> treatment inhibited tumor formation in a mouse model that spontaneously develops lymphomas through both induction of apoptosis as well as inhibition of proliferation  <cit> . however, the primary mechanism of action of gsk <dig> observed in this study appears to be anti-proliferative in the cell lines and xenografts evaluated. collectively these data indicate that the balance of the role of akt signaling in either cell survival or proliferation is likely to be dependent on tumor type.

in this study, independent identification of hypotheses supported by a preponderance of evidence in each cell culture and xenograft experimental model enabled the comparison of the drug mechanism of action in each distinct experimental model at the hypothesis level. further, as evidenced in this study, while treatment with the same compound can lead to large and mostly non-overlapping changes in cell lines and xenografts from various histological origins, underlying mechanisms of action are conserved . interestingly, as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the causal network model of common mechanisms of sensitivity to gsk <dig> derived by rca only accounted for between 29-34% of the rna-based xenograft changes  ). this suggests that there are clearly additional mechanisms of response to gsk <dig> that are not accounted for by the current causal model. there are several factors that may account for this observation. first, the goal of the analysis was to identify conserved mechanisms of response in sensitive cell lines, thus excluding those mechanisms supported by the data that were unique to specific cell lines. additionally, as the rca methodology is based on the causal knowledge modeled for each gene expression change that is linked to underlying literature knowledge of each transcript/protein, therefore expression changes where such information is sparse are less likely to contribute significantly to the causal model.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the mechanism of action of a novel akt kinase inhibitor, gsk <dig>  using a causal network model, that allows a diverse data set to be explained by common hypotheses. inhibition of akt kinases in cell culture and tumor xenografts results in cell cycle inhibition by altering various cellular mechanisms, which are interrelated. these mechanisms include increasing foxo transcriptional activity, inhibition of myc transcriptional activity, decreased tfrc activity, and induction of rb1-mediated cell cycle arrest. our findings demonstrate one of the main tenets of systems biology, that the networks that regulate cellular processes are often conserved across various tumor and tissue types, even when the transcriptional response of these tissues is markedly different.
