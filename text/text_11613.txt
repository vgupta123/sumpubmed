BACKGROUND
the unique posttranslational modification patterns on histones have been conceptualized as epigenetic codes that may finely tune transcription of specific genes  <cit> . histone acetyltransferases , including p300/cbp and pcaf/gcn <dig>  are responsible for modification of histones by acetylation on the exposed lysines  <cit> .

pcaf/gcn <dig> are important members of histone acetyltransferases. homozygous gcn <dig> knockout mice died during embryogenesis, while the majority of pcaf knockout mice developed normal  <cit> . however, the pcaf knockout mice later showed memory impairment, psychological anxiety and defects in stress control  <cit> . interestingly, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the pcaf gene was found in patients with coronary heart abnormalities that resulted in vascular morbidity and mortality  <cit> .

metazoan pcaf/gcn <dig> proteins have three conserved domains–n terminal extension region, hat domain and bromodomain   <cit> . the hat and brd are also highly conserved in yeast and plants  <cit> . the hat domain of pcaf/gcn <dig> has a globular structure that contains an acetyl-coa binding pocket  <cit> . acetyl-coa binds the hat domain through the pyrophosphate body and pantetheine arm  <cit> . substrates of histones and non-histones, such as p <dig>  induce large conformational changes in the active pocket of the pcaf hat domain through extensive interactions that anchor specific lysines for acetylation  <cit> . interestingly, pcaf/gcn <dig> have slightly different specificity. gcn <dig> acetylates histones h <dig> and h <dig> with favorable sites of lysines  <dig> and  <dig> on histone h <dig> and lysines  <dig> and  <dig> on histone h <dig>  <cit> . in comparison, pcaf mainly acetylates lysine  <dig> on h <dig>  <cit>  and also specifically acetylates p <dig> at lysine  <dig> to enhance responses to dna damage  <cit> .

more importantly, the metazoan pcaf/gcn <dig> are usually present in the megadalton complexes saga  and atac   <cit> . the additional components ada <dig> and ada <dig>  are required to form a minimal core complex that can efficiently acetylate histone octamer and nucleosome  <cit> . in addition to a pcaf binding domain, ada <dig> has a swirm domain that binds nucleosomal dna  <cit> . a sant domain at ada <dig> n terminus has been proposed to direct histone tails to specifically associate with pcaf catalytic site  <cit> . through a structurally unknown c terminal domain ada <dig> physically associates with ada <dig> in the core complex  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism of this core complex in the regulation of pcaf/gcn <dig> catalytic activity and specificity remains largely unknown.

in this report we present structure-based biochemical characterization of the pcaf hat domain. we show that the pcaf hat domain can form a dimer in a concentration dependent manner. all our experimental data suggest that pcaf may exist as a possible dimer in its atac complex.

RESULTS
overall structures
the pcaf hat domain  was purified and crystallized in a unique condition that contained  <dig>  m ammonium sulfate and  <dig>  m lithium sulfate. the structure was solved by molecular replacement. to our surprise, we found four hat domains in one asymmetric unit . the structure of each hat domain remains almost the same globular folding  of  <dig> - <dig>  for cα backbone). the overall structure is similar to the pcaf structure  solved by marmorstein and his co-workers  <cit> , except for the loop  <dig> , which was not defined due to lack of clear electron density . our pcaf structure is also similar to human gcn <dig>   <cit>  and tetrahymena gcn <dig>   <cit> . in addition to the l <dig>  loop  <dig>  is also significantly different from tetrahymena gcn <dig>  which is bound by a histone peptide .

we found that the four pcaf hat domains in one asymmetric unit form two different dimers . the residues of both interfaces were very well defined on electron density maps . the first dimer is formed by four-helical stacking of helices α <dig> and α <dig>  and has a canonical interface with a buried surface area of 1530 Å <dig>  the four residues leu <dig>  val <dig>  thr <dig> and phe <dig> from both monomers form a central hydrophobic core, while gln <dig> and asn <dig> create four pairs of hydrogen bonds. in addition, met <dig> and thr <dig> or two his <dig> residues located at the periphery of the interface make additional van der waals contacts.

the second dimer of the pcaf hat domain is mediated through the ß-sheet extension of two antiparallel ß <dig> strands . the major contacts of this dimer are three hydrogen bonds between amino acids 493- <dig>  this interface is further stabilized by a hydrogen bond from two his <dig> residues and van der waals contacts from two ile <dig> and tyr <dig> and his <dig> from each monomer. the buried surface area of this interface is 879 Å <dig> 

taken together, the results show that the pcaf hat domain forms two distinct dimers. the clusters of hydrophobic residues contribute their important roles to the interactions. while the first interface is significant, however, the second interface may likely be produced during crystal packing due to the smaller size and insignificant score calculated by pisa program .

pcaf dimers detected by pulldown experiments
we next wanted to know whether pcaf hat domain exists as a dimer in solution. we first used a maltose binding protein  affinity pulldown experiment. the pcaf hat domain in mbp fusion was used to pull down another one in his-tag fusion . his-tagged pcaf was clearly observed in beads fraction when incubated with mbp-pcaf but not in mbp alone  compared with a loading control .

in order to analyze pcaf oligomeric state in cells, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using ha and flag tags . the full-length pcaf was tagged with either ha or flag peptides at its n terminus. flag affinity gel was used to bind flag-pcaf. the ha-pcaf was readily detected when flag-pcaf was co-expressed , suggesting that over-expressed pcaf may self-associate to form oligomers in cells.

pcaf dimers disrupted by mutations in interfaces
to confirm the presence of the pcaf dimers in solution we then used a chemical cross-linking method . we observed a dominant dimer on sds-page after the pcaf hat domain was incubated with a cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate  . a ladder of higher molecular-weight oligomers was also appeared .

we continued to examine whether mutations in pcaf dimerization interfaces would affect its dimers’ formation. to disrupt the first interface, we generated a triple mutant lmv512aaa  . however, this mutant did not appear to affect the pcaf dimerization . in comparison, a mutant with the leu <dig> and val <dig> altered to aspartic acid  and phe <dig> to alanine  did have small effects on the presence of pcaf dimer and higher oligomers . an lv512dd and f539a combined mutant lvf512dda was clearly less prone to form a dimer .

to disrupt the second interface, we removed the first three n terminal amino acids  that are responsible for β-sheet extension . however, the shortened pcaf hat domain itself behaves as the wt pcaf in this experiment . the shortened pcaf hat domain  was then combined with mutations of the first interface studied above  to generate two mutants . as expected, both mutations, in particular the lvf2dda, clearly suppressed dimer formation of the hat domain .

these data support our crystallographic observation that both interfaces contribute to the dimeric formation of pcaf in our cross-linking experiment. however, the second interface may result from a crystal packing as suggested by our crystallographic analyses since the deletion mutant  did not change its ability to form a dimer. it is important to note that our introduction of these mutations into pcaf did not affect enzymatic activity of pcaf hat domain .

pcaf dimer detected by static light scattering
to seek more evidence for presence of dimers in solution, we analyzed pcaf hat domain using multiangle static light scattering , which measures absolute molecular weight  of a particle without any assumptions. a protein is first separated on a hplc that is directly connected with detectors for measuring differential refractive index  and light scattering . the theoretical mw of the hat domain  including n terminal his tag is  <dig>  kda. here three different protein concentrations at  <dig>   <dig> and 20 mg/ml were used in this experiment . the peak  <dig> was analyzable only at 20 mg/ml, which was determined to be  <dig>  kda. the major portion of this protein remained in peak  <dig>  which had the closest mw to pcaf hat domain monomer at 2 mg/ml. the mw of peak  <dig> was  <dig>  kda at 6 mg/ml and  <dig>  kda at 20 mg/ml, suggesting that part of large particles from peak  <dig> was not separable. all these data indicate that pcaf hat domain may remain in a dimer-monomer equilibrium with dominant monomeric species in solution.

discussion
protein acetylation is well known for its role in epigenetic regulation of transcription and is also involved in translation, protein turnover, localization and quality control, thus linking acetylation to a variety of biological processes such as cell shape, migration and autophagy  <cit> . moreover, pcaf/gcn <dig> family members have been implicated in carcinogenesis and drug targets for cancer therapy  <cit> . marmorstein and his coworkers have extensively studied the structures and enzymatic mechanism of the catalytic domain and histone binding of these histone acetyltransferases  <cit> . here in this report, our structural and biochemical analyses demonstrate that pcaf can exit as a dimer.

we solved the crystal structure of the pcaf hat domain in two different dimeric states. one of these dimeric interfaces is large  created by several hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts . the second interface is rather small, which may likely be generated during crystal packing . the crystals in this study were grown in  <dig>  m lithium sulfate and  <dig>  m ammoniumn sulfate at ph <dig> , which were packed in the space group p <dig>  the same human pcaf hat domain was crystallized with space group p <dig> in a slightly different condition and no interfaces were found between its symmetric or asymmetric units  <cit> . we also crystallized human gcn <dig> hat domain in a simple precipitant of 35% tacsimate ph  <dig>  from index screen kit  and the crystal was packed in a space group i <dig>  . consistently, we found  <dig> gcn <dig> monomers in one asymmetric unit that form the same dimeric interfaces as those described above for pcaf . the gcn <dig> dimer was well aligned with the pcaf with rmsd of  <dig>  Å .

for comparison, we listed all crystal structures of pcaf/gcn <dig> homologues from tetrahymena, yeast and human . in one crystal form of a tetrahymena gcn <dig> hat domain, a dimeric interface is also formed through anti-parallel helices h <dig> and h <dig> between two hat domains in one asymmetric unit . unfortunately, based on our pisa analysis, this interface is likely produced by a crystal packing . consistently, two critical residues met <dig> and gln <dig> that are responsible for dimerization in human pcaf are replaced with two lysines in tetrahymena gcn <dig> .

in order to confirm whether the human pcaf hat domain appears dimers in solution, we performed a series of experiments, including mbp pulldown, cross-linking and mals . all these data supported that the pcaf hat domain is able to form a dimer in solution. mals experiment, however, indicated that the dimer forms only at low ratio because it could only be readily detected at higher protein concentration . the apparent mw was close to the theoretical one only at the lowest protein concentration, suggesting the larger mw was likely resulted of presence of the pcaf dimer.

interestingly, the n terminal brd domain of brd <dig> protein has been found to be a dimer, allowing to significantly enhance the binding to histone h <dig> and aides with further recognition of the hypoacetylated h4k <dig>  <cit> . indeed, the brd domains of the pcaf/gcn <dig> family members also form dimers in crystallographic conditions , which have relatively large interfaces . even though their significant scores are  <dig>  a synergistic effect of the hat and brd domains in dimer formation may possibly stabilize pcaf oligomeric state in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
since pcaf/gcn <dig> always exist in megadalton complexes, one possibility is that pcaf dimerization may help to better associate with a nucleosome for efficient histone acetylation, which is depicted in our proposed model . pcaf/gcn <dig> attach to the nucleosomal dna through ada <dig> swim domain. pcaf/gcn <dig> bromodomain dimer may further dock the histone h <dig> through the h4k <dig> and h4k <dig> sites, which are acetylated before incorporated into the nucleosome  <cit> . the hat domain dimer then recruits a histone h <dig> tail for acetylations at h3k <dig> and neighbor sites, including h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  the sant domain of ada <dig> may directly associate with the h <dig> and h <dig> tails and help to better position these for the acetylation process. therefore, all these domains contribute to the overall acetylation level and specificity of histones even though their interactions with histones and dna are extremely weak per se. interestingly, the 3d reconstruction of complex saga has positioned gcn <dig> and other brd-containing proteins in adjacent region, which may lead to a better association of saga and histone tails through multiple interactions  <cit> .

in summary, our structural and biochemical studies suggest that the pcaf/gcn <dig> hat domain can form a dimer in solution. we propose a model that this dimerization may be important for acetylations on specific sites of histones since multiple contacts may synergistically position pcaf/gcn <dig> megadalton complexes on the nucleosome. an important question whether pcaf/gcn <dig> are dimers in their functional complexes is currently under our investigations.
