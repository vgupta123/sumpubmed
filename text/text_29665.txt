BACKGROUND
adoptive transfer of cd8+ t cells from mhc class i-restricted ova specific t cell receptor  transgenic mice  into host c57bl/ <dig> mice allows for the activated cd8+ t cell population to be tracked and quantified after stimulation with the ova peptide siinfekl  <cit>  using standard flow cytometric analysis. using this methodology, it has been demonstrated that activated cd8+ t cells undergo migration to the liver where they are trapped and undergo apoptosis  <cit> . while flow cytometry is sensitive and specific, it is best suited to tissues from which single cell suspensions can be obtained easily, such as the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes. although flow cytometry can be performed on lymphocytes isolated from other tissues such as liver, muscle and intestine, it is technically more challenging and questions may be raised regarding whether the cell sample is representative of the in vivo state. reports by lang , lim , and gallard ,  <cit>  also emphasize these points and describe pcr based approaches for tracking specific t-cell clonotypes. additionally, sample preparation for histologic analysis and nucleic acid or protein-based assessment is incompatible with tissue dis-aggregation methods for flow cytometry. in order to augment standard flow cytometric analysis in these more challenging experimental settings, a real-time quantitative pcr assay was developed to quantify and track activated ot- <dig> cells with a high degree of sensitivity.

because the ot- <dig> mouse was made by micronuclear injection of genomic dna, which did not contain unique transgene non-coding sequence, we based a quantitative pcr strategy on the dna sequence encoding the rearranged vdj sequences corresponding to the cdr <dig> region of the tcr beta chain. as genomic dna is the starting point for qpcr, any tissue harvested from a host mouse can be assayed for the ot- <dig> transgene. additionally, nucleic acid isolated from paraffin-embedded material is also a suitable template for real-time quantitative pcr, making this technique useful for analysis of archival paraffin-embedded material.

the utility and sensitivity of a qpcr assay designed to detect the ot- <dig> transgene was compared to the standard method of flow cytometry to track and quantify activated ot- <dig> cells in both in vitro dilution and in vivo adoptive transfer experiments.

RESULTS
ot- <dig> genotyping pcr is a specific and reliable method to determine positive ot- <dig> mice from wild-type littermates
a pcr strategy was developed to identify ot- <dig> positive transgenic mice, which express a t cell receptor  specific for the ova peptide siinfekl, from wild-type littermates. primers were designed in the vdj region of the ot- <dig> tcrβ chain  to yield a  <dig> bp product. figure  <dig> demonstrates that the ot- <dig> fragment is amplified from ot- <dig> positive transgenic mice , but not from wild-type littermates . flow cytometric phenotyping of pcr positive ot- <dig> mice confirmed the specificity of the reaction .

a quantitative real-time pcr assay was developed using a  <dig> base pair fluorophore-coupled oligonucleotide probe, with sequence-dependent hybridization within the  <dig> base pair amplified vdj region of the ot- <dig> tcr. this assay was successful at determining ot- <dig> transgenic mice from negative littermates. figure  <dig> shows data from a real-time pcr experiment using the pcrtopo <dig> -ot <dig> plasmid at various concentrations and genomic dna isolated from positive and negative ot- <dig> transgenic mice. based on the plasmid standard curve,  <dig> e+ <dig> copies of the ot- <dig> transgene were present in  <dig> ng of genomic dna from an ot- <dig> positive mouse. there was no signal amplification when genomic dna from the ot- <dig> negative mouse was used as template, or in the no template control. to normalize all qpcr results for the ot- <dig> transgene, a fluorophore-coupled oligonucleotide probe and primer set for murine β-actin was also designed and used for each sample.

to improve upon the sensitivity of the quantitative pcr assay sequence-independent detection with sybr green i was also performed. double-stranded dna product was quantified by monitoring fluorescence of the dna-binding sybr green i dye. plasmid pcrtopo <dig>  containing the ot- <dig> fragment was used as template in a standard curve analysis at concentrations of  <dig> ng to  <dig> e- <dig> ng, correlating to  <dig> e+ <dig> to  <dig> e+ <dig> copies of transgene. this real-time pcr strategy was successful at detection down to  <dig>  copies of the transgene and did not amplify signal in the absence of dna template. melting curve analysis also showed a single pcr product was generated. in subsequent experiments using genomic dna isolated from animal tissue, however, high background signals and multiple fluorescent peaks were generated, indicating a quantitative pcr assay based on sybr green would not be sufficient for future experiments.

sensitivity and specificity of real-time quantitative pcr on diluted ot- <dig> genomic dna
the linear range of sensitivity of the qpcr assay was determined by diluting ot- <dig> dna  with genomic dna isolated from a non-transgenic c57bl/ <dig> normal mouse. figure  <dig> shows a regression analysis of the logarithmic values for normalized ot- <dig> copy number  by real-time qpcr  plotted against the logarithmic values of the actual dna dilution values. the calculated r <dig> value for the regression analysis was  <dig> . the real-time assay was used to quantify a range of 5% to  <dig> % of ot- <dig> dna diluted into background c57bl/ <dig> dna. the real-time qpcr could also distinguish  <dig> % ot- <dig> dna from  <dig> % ot- <dig> dna, demonstrating that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay would be sufficient for future applications.

quantitative real-time pcr for detection of ot- <dig> cd8+t cells diluted into normal c57bl/ <dig> splenocytes
to test the sensitivity of the real-time assay, ot- <dig> cd <dig> +t cells were purified from an ot- <dig> transgenic mouse. ot- <dig> cells were diluted into splenocytes isolated from normal c57bl/ <dig> mice so that the dilutions were comprised of 100%, 4%,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %.  <dig> %, and  <dig> % ot- <dig> cells in a background of wild-type c57bl/ <dig> splenocytes. previous to the dilutions, flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine cell purity and yield of both cell suspensions, which were both resuspended at  <dig> million cells/ml.  <dig> μl was taken for flow cytometric analysis and genomic dna was isolated from the remaining  <dig>  million cells.  <dig> ng of genomic dna from each dilution  was used as template for quantitative pcr to determine ot- <dig> and β-actin copy number.

accumulation of activated ot- <dig> t-cells after adoptive transfer by real-time quantitative pcr
accumulation of activated ot- <dig> cd8+ t cells in the liver after adoptive transfer and in vivo activation and expansion has been well documented  <cit> . the purpose of these experiments was to determine whether a quantitative pcr assay would be sensitive enough to also monitor and quantify the migration of t-cells to the liver and other organs after an adoptive transfer experiment compared to results obtained using standard flow cytometric analysis.

spleens from the same animals, sacrificed on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> after first i.p. injection with peptide, were analyzed in the same manner . roughly half of the spleen was prepared for flow cytometric analysis and the remaining half was used for dna isolation and qpcr. the percent of ot- <dig> cells by facs analysis in the spleen samples were compared to the normalized ot- <dig> gene levels. again, while there was variation in the absolute numbers, both methods show an expanded ot- <dig> cd8+ t-cell population in the spleens of ova treated animals, which is most prominent on the day  <dig> timepoint, and had similar trends. when the normalized copies of the ot- <dig> transgene for all liver and spleen samples from each timepoint were plotted against the percent of ot- <dig> cells by flow cytometric analysis, the correlation coefficient was calculated at r <dig> =  <dig> .

the results from these experiments demonstrate the utility of a quantitative pcr assay on a tissue that is amenable  and one that is not so amenable  to flow cytometry. while the trends of ot- <dig> cell accumulation in the various organs were very similar there were definite differences in the resulting numbers. part of the discrepancy may be due to sampling artifact: although the same tissue specimens were used for flow cytometry and qpcr, different sections of the tissue were used in each assay. a small portion of tissue  was needed for dna isolation, while one half to three-quarters of the tissue was used to make cell suspensions for flow cytometry, implying that variation inherent to each individual organ was present and was a possible contributor to the observed discrepancies. also pertinent to this argument is to point out that flow cytometric analysis in the liver involves sampling the leukocyte fraction after a mononuclear cell isolation, where dna isolation for qpcr analysis from whole liver includes the large parenchymal population. quantitative pcr and flow cytometry also have different denominators to consider. flow cytometry determines the percent of ot- <dig> cells out of the selected cd8+ cd <dig> + positive population in the leukocyte gate while qpcr determines the number of ot- <dig> copies in all of the sampled dna.

to further test the utility of this assay, the lungs of each animal were also flash frozen and stored for later dna isolation. due to the difficulty in obtaining adequate materiel for single cell suspensions, flow cytometric analysis was not performed from lung tissue. since qpcr requires isolated nucleic acid material and not single cell suspensions, quantitative ot- <dig> transgene numbers could be easily obtained from lung samples. after normalization to the β-actin control, results from quantitative pcr show a marked increase in ot- <dig> transgene copy number in the ova treated animals compared to pbs controls . these results further demonstrate the utility of this assay for tissue samples that are difficult to disassociate for flow cytometry and also that a migratory ot- <dig> cd8+ t cell population is present in lung tissue of animals after adoptive transfer experiments.

quantitative pcr analysis of ot- <dig> transgene on archival material
paraffin embedded slides  were made from liver sections of c57bl/ <dig> mice used as hosts in ot- <dig> cd8+ t cell adoptive transfer experiments. the animals were sacrificed on day five after the first i.p injection of the stimulating ova peptide or pbs control. histological examination of the slides confirmed the presence of foci  in the livers of animals given ova peptide while livers of mice given pbs injections did not have significant foci formation. dna isolated from the paraffin-embedded slides was used in real-time qpcr for detection of the ot- <dig> transgene. although the paraffin slides had been stored at room temperature for approximately  <dig> months, genomic dna was readily isolated from the samples. figure  <dig> demonstrates average levels of the ot- <dig> transgene in animals that had received the ova stimulating peptide were nearly five-fold higher than in pbs control animals, confirming the utility of the qpcr assay on archived experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this work was to develop a qpcr method for the tracking and quantification of activated ot- <dig> cd8+ t cells as an alternative to flow cytometric analysis. while sensitivity and specificity of flow cytometry is sufficient for most applications, it is limited to tissue in which single cell suspensions can be obtained without a high degree of difficulty, such as the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes. flow cytometry can also be performed on liver tissue, with more difficulty, by using a very time consuming protocol. the purification of mononuclear cells for flow cytometric analysis from brain or muscle tissue is also quite difficult and could limit the value of the transgenic model of t cell activation and clearance in an experimental setting where a complete tissue survey was required. our real-time quantitative pcr assay is useful for detection of the ot- <dig> transgene using both in vitro and in vivo experiments, particularly where flow cytometry is difficult. on a more practical level, it should be noted that quantitative pcr assays are relatively easy to use and can be performed in a variety of settings. also, samples from ongoing experiments with multiple time points can be harvested and stored until all specimens are obtained and can be prepared all at the same time.

we have validated the quantitative real-time pcr for the ot- <dig> transgene against known numbers of ot- <dig> cells in dilution experiments in vitro and correlated the pcr against flow cytometric assessment. in addition, we have validated the ot- <dig> qpcr against flow cytometric analysis of tissue samples. in all cases, we have observed excellent correlation. therefore, we are confident that this quantitative pcr based approach to detect ot- <dig> cells will be a very useful tool in the detection and quantification of ot- <dig> cells in a variety of experimental models.
