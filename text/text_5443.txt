BACKGROUND
the genus coffea includes about  <dig> species of subtropical/tropical woody perennial trees and shrubs , of which at least two species are of worldwide agro-economic interest. nearly 75% of world coffee production originates from coffea arabica l., while about 20% comes from c. canephora pierre ex a. froehner . orange coffee leaf rust is considered to be one of the major plagues affecting c. arabica  <cit> . the fungus responsible for the disease, hemileia vastatrix berkeley & broome, is widely spread throughout coffee-growing countries and can cause severe defoliation, resulting in substantial berry yield losses  <cit> . furthermore, the two current approaches for restricting pathogen infection offer limited advantages. first, fungicide application, although cost-effective, does not always result in adequate disease control and, moreover, it has a negative environmental impact. second, even though several varieties of coffee that are resistant to h. vastatrix have been used for introgression purposes  <cit> , such alternatives are time-consuming and do not provide durable resistance due to the rapid co-evolution of races of the fungus that harbor new virulence genes  <cit> . therefore, additional methods to control leaf rust in the fields are required.

h. vastatrix is an obligate biotrophic parasite belonging to the division basidiomycetes, order pucciniales  <cit> . following urediospore germination on the abaxial leaf surface, hyphae grow and penetrate intercellular spaces of the mesophyll tissue through stomatal openings before differentiating intra-cellular feeding structures, or haustoria. in susceptible coffee plants, the successful pathogen can complete its dikaryotic cycle within three weeks following infection and reach the ultimate stage, which is characterized by the formation of a sporulating sorus. in resistant plants, hyphal invasion is rapidly sensed and arrested within 2- <dig> days  <cit> . based on quantitative and mendelian genetic studies  <cit> , the occurrence of at least nine dominant resistance  genes in coffea spp., and a similar number of fungal virulence genes, have been inferred. it is thus commonly accepted that the outcome of coffee/rust interactions, whether the plant resists pathogen attack  or develops disease , relies on the gene-for-gene model  <cit> , which has been recently amended  <cit> . once delivered into coffee cells, h. vastatrix effector proteins, and the intracellular perturbations that they trigger, are supposed to be perceived by specific r-proteins. the recognition step promotes the launching of signaling defense pathway and subsequent resistance. alternatively, virulent rust races are believed to secrete effectors that escape or even counteract the host surveillance system, which allow for the highjacking of coffee cell metabolism and tissue colonization  <cit> .

during incompatible interactions with biotrophic pathogens, the plant resistance phenotype results from the onset of a complex and multilayered-defense response, which is the so-called hypersensitive response or hr  <cit> . although little is still known about the molecular mechanisms that govern resistance to h. vastatrix, several studies have advanced the case for the existence of a hr-like phenomenon in coffee plants. resistant varieties that were inoculated with avirulent fungal strains displayed a morphotype that exhibits many hr characteristics. these include rapid host cell death, which is localized at the infection site and that is associated with fungal hyphae collapse  <cit> , callose encasement of haustoria and subsequent cell wall lignification  <cit> , early oxidative burst  <cit> , and the activation of typical defense-related genes  <cit> .

in previous work, we performed a suppression subtractive hybridization-based screening in c. arabica that had been challenged with h. vastatrix and identified a series of expressed sequence tags  that were regulated during compatible or incompatible interactions  <cit> . one of these ests shared a significant identity with the coding sequence of the non-race-specific disease resistance  <dig>  gene. originally isolated in arabidopsis thaliana, ndr <dig> encodes a small plasma membrane-resident protein, the deficiency of which was found to abolish hr and confer susceptibility to some fungal and bacterial pathogens carrying specific effector genes  <cit> . notably, it has been established that ndr1-driven resistance is dependent on a specific subset of r-proteins  that are defined by the presence of a coiled-coil  structure within their n-terminal parts  <cit> . from a mechanistic perspective, the best characterized example illustrating ndr <dig> function is the pathosystem involving strain dc3000::avrrpt <dig> of the plant pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato . in this model, under resting conditions, atndr <dig> indirectly retains the rps <dig> protein on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane through its interaction with the rpm1-interacting protein  <dig> , thereby preventing hr activation  <cit> . upon infection with pst, the bacterial protease avrrpt <dig> is secreted into the cytoplasm where it can cleave rin <dig>  releasing rps <dig> and initiating a disease resistance signaling pathway  <cit> .

in this study, we cloned two c. arabica candidate cdnas for ndr <dig> and analyzed the deduced primary amino-acid sequences. domain conservation and the high degree of homology between the coffee proteins and atndr <dig> led us to undertake a genetic complementation approach. using the arabidopsis ndr1- <dig> null mutant, we obtained genetic and molecular evidence that at least one of our candidate genes is a functional ndr <dig> ortholog. both laser-confocal microscopy and biochemical analyses further suggested that the protein is likely to be attached to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor. based on these data, the possibility that a ndr1-contingent mechanism could be invoked in r-gene-mediated resistance to h. vastatrix is discussed. the impact this result could have in the context of resistance improvement is also outlined.

RESULTS
cloning and analysis of a novel ndr <dig> sequence homolog from coffea arabica
in previous work  <cit> , we used a subtractive hybridization approach to identify genes involved in defense/resistance of coffee plants  to the orange rust fungus h. vastatrix. of the  <dig> ests which were significantly up-regulated during hr, one displayed 43% identity with the canonical ndr <dig> coding sequence from a. thaliana. in this study, we focused our efforts on the coffee candidate for ndr <dig> gene and isolated two distinct full-length transcripts by nested race-pcr. the corresponding cdnas were cloned as described in the 'methods' section . open reading frames differed from one another by only  <dig> single nucleotide positions with one of the substitutions being non-silent . both sequences were predicted to encode proteins that were  <dig> amino acids long, which shared a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig> .

searching for arabidopsis relatives of our proteins, we screened the genbank database by means of the blast p algorithm  <cit>  and retrieved  <dig> non-redundant hits. as expected, the best match appeared to be ndr <dig> with 42/61% identity/homology. apart from an unknown sequence, all identified homologs had been previously described as members of the ndr1/hin1-like  protein superfamily  <cit> . nhls account for a vast class of plant defense-associated proteins that, within their n-terminal halves, contain two highly conserved peptide patterns  and a less conserved one   <cit> . alignment of the proteins, along with the tobacco hin <dig> for comparison, revealed the position of the three motifs within sequences . a phylogenetic analysis using solely the conserved region that is presented in figure  <dig>  and which encompasses the three nhl motifs, showed that candr1a/b, ndr <dig>  nhl <dig> and nhl <dig> formed a group that was distinct from other nhls . these data indicate that ndr <dig>  nhl <dig> and nhl <dig> are the closest arabidopsis relatives of candr1a/b.

ectopic expression of candr1a in arabidopsis ndr1- <dig> null mutant restores specific resistance to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 
from our in silico analysis, the question arises as to whether the two identified coffee genes are functional homologs of atndr <dig> or code for distinct nhl counterparts. to answer this question, a genetic complementation approach was undertaken. given the high degree of identity between the two predicted candr <dig> amino-acid sequences, we decided to study candr1a and expressed the corresponding orf under the control of the camv35s promoter in the arabidopsis ndr1- <dig> null mutant. segregation analysis on a selective medium allowed for the isolation of single-locus, homozygous insertion lines . t <dig> lines were then screened by rt-qpcr for high steady-state levels of transgene transcripts and three of them were selected for further experiments. the expression level of candr1a in these lines, designated t3- <dig>  t3- <dig> and t3- <dig>  was respectively 92-, 190-, and 714-fold higher than that of the endogenous atndr <dig> gene, when compared to wt col- <dig> plants grown under the exact same conditions.

previous work has shown that the ndr1- <dig> null mutant is incapable of hr activation in response to pst strain dc3000::avrrpt <dig> carrying an avrrpt <dig> cassette-containing plasmid  <cit> . conversely, a high overexpression level of atndr <dig> in the col- <dig> genetic background was found to confer enhanced disease resistance to strain dc <dig>  <cit> . the behavior of our overexpressor lines was thus examined in response to the two isogenic bacterial strains  by recording macroscopic symptoms and following in planta bacterial growth over a four-day period. although coppinger et al.  <cit>  had previously reported the occurrence of hr-like lesions in non-inoculated arabidopsis transgenic lines overexpressing atndr <dig>  no such lesions were observed in our non-inoculated t <dig> lines. although the three genotypes developed disease symptoms in response to dc <dig> , t3- <dig> and t3- <dig> lines were less susceptible than the ndr1- <dig> mutant plants, as shown by the leaf bacterial contents at four days post-inoculation  . upon a challenge with dc3000::avrrpt <dig>  wt plants exhibited typical hypersensitive lesions located within the infiltrated area, whereas ndr1- <dig> mutants showed disease-like symptoms characterized by tissue yellowing, which spread outside the inoculated zone . as expected, such striking differences between the wt and ndr1- <dig> genotypes were closely correlated with leaf bacterial amounts. for instance, as early as  <dig> dpi, mutant leaves already showed a 10-fold increase in the concentration of bacteria compared to wt leaves . more importantly, when inoculated with strain dc3000::avrrpt <dig>  all three candr1a-expressing lines presented a hr-like phenotype  that was associated with bacterial levels statistically comparable to that of wt plants . furthermore, expression of the coffee transgene in the arabidopsis mutant had no significant impact on the rps4-coordinated hr that had been previously shown to be independent of atndr <dig>  <cit>  . altogether, these results provide genetic evidence that candr1a functionally and specifically complements the ndr1- <dig> mutant.

the mature candr1a protein is c-terminally processed
the arabidopsis ndr <dig> protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including multiple glycosylations and c-terminus processing. the latter cleavage removes a small portion of the protein, thereby freeing an amino-acid residue known as a ω-site  that was proposed to be modified by covalent binding to a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol -anchor  <cit> . in accordance with the cognate role of atndr <dig> in disease resistance signalling  <cit> , gpi anchoring is usually encountered in eukaryotic plasma membrane-resident proteins and allows for the cell surface-tethering phenomenon  <cit> . although there is no established consensus sequence of gpi-anchor attachment sites, prediction algorithms are available online. using the big-pi plant predictor  <cit> , we identified two putative overlapping cleavage sites in the primary amino-acid sequence of candr1a , with residues s <dig> and g <dig> being strong ω-site candidates . furthermore, candr1a and its arabidopsis ortholog share common structural features that are believed to be necessary for gpi attachment by the transamidase complex in endoplasmic reticulum  membranes  <cit> . directly downstream of the potential ω-residues is a region predicted to encompass a short polar spacer, followed by a hydrophobic tail. an uncleavable signal peptide  comprising a potential transmembrane domain  was also predicted with a high probability of occurrence  using signalp- <dig>  software  <cit> . as previously suggested  <cit> , this n-terminal signal sequence might be required for the protein to enter the er network and travel through the secretory pathway.

based on this in silico analysis, we decided to investigate the possibility of c-terminus processing for candr1a. to this end, a doubly-tagged candr1a version  was created  and transiently expressed in tobacco leaves. we reasoned that, if the candr1a protein is cleaved in tobacco cells, the loss of its c-terminus should be easily visualized upon immunoblotting by the absence of a his-specific signal, whereas the proof that the protein is synthesized would be provided by the presence of a ha-specific signal.

two to three days post-infiltration with an agrobacterium strain, which was dedicated to the expression of the ha-candr1a-his construct, protein extracts prepared from fresh tissues were resolved by sds-page and immunoblotted using either ha- or his-specific antisera as described in the 'methods' section. immunoblot conditions were tested using a n-terminally ha-tagged candr1a  and c-terminally his-tagged bax inhibitor  <dig>  versions as controls. six independent experiments including independent agrobacterium infiltrations and protein extractions were carried out. using anti-ha antibody, only one major band was detectable in lanes loaded with ndr <dig> samples , whereas no specific signal was visualized in lanes loaded with negative control samples . although the nucleotide sequences of ha-candr1a and ha-candr1a-his code for proteins with predicted molecular weights averaging 25- <dig> kda, the detected proteins migrated to approximately  <dig> kda under denaturating conditions. such an apparent discrepancy is not surprising based on previous work. coppinger and coworkers  <cit> , indeed, showed that the native atndr <dig> protein resolved by sds-page displays a mass of about  <dig> kda instead of the predicted  <dig>  kda. these authors further demonstrated that the protein regains its theoretical size when translated in vitro without the machinery dedicated to glycosylation, indicating that the latter post-translational modification could account for the migration shift of the mature proteins on polyacrylamide gels. consistently, the candr1a protein, like its arabidopsis ortholog, exhibits a significant number of putative glycosylation sites . hence, one can assume that our protein extracts  are likely to contain glycosylated forms of candr1a, the migration behavior of which is altered on polyacrylamide gels.

finally, using the same set of samples and anti-his antibody, we were unable to detect ha-ndr1-his protein , whereas bi1-his protein  was clearly identified . the latter data indicate that candr1a is c-terminally processed in tobacco leaves, which strongly suggests that the protein is modified by addition of a gpi moiety. further experiments are nevertheless needed to confirm this assumption.

candr1a is localized to the plasma membrane
indirect data support the association of the candr1a protein with membranes:  the potential post-translational modification by addition of a gpi-anchor;  a predicted transmembrane-spanning domain located within the n-terminal signal peptide , and  the need of a detergent for the protein to be extracted from tobacco leaf tissues when transiently expressed . accordingly, the candr1a protein was predicted to be localized to the plasma membrane  using chlorop <dig>  and psortii software  <cit> . therefore, in order to assess its subcellular localization, a gfp <dig> translational fusion was created , transformed into leaf epidermal tobacco cells using agrobacterium tumefaciens as the vector, and imaged by confocal microscopy . in accordance with our working hypothesis, independent experiments showed a consistent fluorescent pattern delineating cellular contours . such a pattern was also observed  with a pm-resident protein fused to mcherry fluorophore  <cit> . in addition, further experiments where both proteins were simultaneously expressed in the same cells revealed a significant overlap between the gfp <dig> and mcherry signals at the cell surface . it is noteworthy that a few gfp6-candr1a-expressing cells displayed not only cell surface labeling, but also internal fluorescence resembling an er-like reticulated network with brighter dots that could represent golgi structures .

because leaf epidermal tobacco cells possess a large central vacuole that presses the cytoplasmic compartment against the pm and cell wall, it is difficult to conclude on the subcellular localization of candr1a based solely on our microscopy data. in order to unambigously ascertain the localization of candr1a, the n-terminally ha-tagged version of candr1a  was transiently expressed in tobacco leaves and purified pm fractions were directly tested for the presence of the protein by immunoblotting using ha-specific antisera. immunoblotting of crude extracts  prepared by directly boiling agroinfiltrated tissues in laemmli buffer indicated that ha-candr1a proteins were succesfully expressed in plant cells . most importantly, the tagged version of candr1a was significantly enriched in pm fractions compared to microsomal ones, as also observed for the endogenous pm-resident protein pma <dig> . in addition, while no signal was detected when  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg proteins of the soluble fraction  was blotted, a ha-specific band, the intensity of which increased with the amount of total proteins loaded, was clearly visualized . altogether, these results show that the mature candr1a protein is targeted to pm in the tobacco heterologous system, further suggesting a similar subcellular localization for the protein in coffee cells.

identification of a potential homologous rin <dig> protein from coffee plants
the arabidopsis ndr <dig> protein has been demonstrated to physically interact with rin <dig> both in a yeast heterologous system and in planta  <cit> . searching for rin <dig> sequence homologs in the harvest© coffea database resulted in the identification of a candidate contig from coffea canephora . the deduced protein sequence shares a high percentage of identity/homology  with the beginning of our query sequence, atrin <dig>  this region is also highly conserved within the rin <dig> family of proteins . one of the two cleavage sites that permit the hydrolysis of rin <dig> upon delivery of the bacterial protease avrrpt <dig> into arabidopsis cells  <cit>  is also conserved in the coffee protein . in line with our previous data , this in silico analysis points to potential mechanistic conservation of the ndr <dig> function in arabidopsis and coffee plants.

discussion
the arabidopsis ndr <dig> locus was identified in the late 1990's using a forward genetic screen based on the loss of resistance to the pst strain dc3000::avrrpt <dig>  <cit> . since then, ndr <dig> homologous genes have been found by sequence comparison in other plant species such as brassica napus  <cit>  and vitis vinifera  <cit> . many sequence homologs  can also be retrieved from the genbank database by means of the blast p algorithm . however, to our knowledge, our data constitute a novel report on the identification and characterization of a functional ndr <dig> homolog, despite the plethora of orthologous candidates.

in this study, several lines of evidence indeed demonstrated that ectopic expression of candr1a coding sequence was able to rescue the phenotype of the arabidopsis ndr1- <dig> null mutant. upon infection with dc3000::avrrpt <dig>  the three mutant lines expressing the coffee transgene were found to develop hypersensitive cell death symptoms that were absent in mutant plants . this macroscopic study was further corroborated by two independent in planta bacterial growth assays showing that leaf populations of the bacterial pathogen in our transgenic lines were low and comparable to those of wt plants . in addition, high overexpression level of the coffee candr1a gene in the col- <dig> genetic background was also found to confer enhanced disease resistance to the dc <dig> strain, as previously reported when the atndr <dig> gene was overexpressed in a. thaliana  <cit> .

importantly, ndr1-driven resistance in a. thaliana is not restricted to bacterial pathogen attacks. two reports have demonstrated that the ndr <dig> mutation renders plants susceptible to infection by the oomycete hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  <cit>  and the fungus verticillium longisporum  <cit> . therefore, given that  candr1a is a functional homolog of the arabidopsis ndr <dig> gene, and  transcripts of the former accumulate in coffee leaves undergoing hr in response to the fungus h. vastatrix  <cit> , it would not be surprising if ndr <dig> proteins could regulate the defense signaling pathway leading to coffee rust resistance. this hypothesis is currently under investigation in our laboratory using a functional approach. recently, we also showed that a. thaliana col- <dig> plants display a rapid non-host response to h. vastatrix. this response is reminiscent of hr in that it prevents haustorium formation and hyphal spread in plant tissues  <cit> . this work raises the possibility of testing the role of ndr <dig> in response to the coffee leaf rust in the a. thaliana heterologous system.

as predicted by our bioinformatic analysis, imaging of gfp6-tagged candr1a protein by confocal microscopy revealed a fluorescent pattern that was consistent with a plasma membrane localization ). colocalization experiments with a pm fluorescent protein marker also supported this observation ). furthermore, the need of an anionic detergent like sodium dodecyl-sulfate for the ha-tagged candr1a proteins to be extracted from tobacco leaves  indicated an association with membranes. finally, our biochemical approach based on the purification of pm by two-phase peg/dextran partitioning  clearly demonstrated the presence of ha-candr1a proteins in tobacco pm fractions. therefore, it is likely that the mature candr1a protein resides in the plasma membrane of coffee cells.

no fluorescent labeling of the organelle corresponding to a gfp <dig> spectrum was observed in chloroplasts, although it had been reported previously for a tagged version of atndr <dig>  <cit> . instead, internal reticulated labeling reminiscent of the er network ) was observed in a few cases and may correspond to cells overloaded with the ectopic fluorescent proteins. this observation is consistent with our results, suggesting that the candr1a protein could be modified by addition of a gpi moiety to its c-terminal part . it has been well-described that proteins tethered to the cell surface by means of a gpi anchor undergo this sort of post-translational modification in the er before being sorted via the secretory pathway to their final destination, i.e., the plasma membrane.

usually, gpi-anchored-proteins are also thought to locate on the apoplasm side of the plasma membrane  <cit> . in a. thaliana, it has been clearly established that ndr <dig> is attached to the plasma membrane through a c-terminal gpi anchor  <cit> . it has also been inferred that the n-terminal portion of ndr <dig> lies within the cytoplasm because it was found to interact with the cytosolic protein rin <dig> in planta  <cit> . since the c-terminal anchor of atndr <dig> is resistant to cleavage by phospholipase c, these data further led to the hypothesis that the protein possesses a transmembrane-spanning domain as a second anchor site. this was recently corroborated by a modelling study  <cit>  and, in fact, the coffee protein, like its arabidopsis relative, was predicted to present a single transmembrane domain , suggesting a similar, but atypical topology of the two counterparts .

recently, a new mode of action of ndr <dig> was revealed by knepper et al.  <cit> . based on structural homology with mammalian integrins and the arabidopsis late embryogenesis abundant  protein  <dig>  known to be involved in abiotic stress response  <cit> , the aforementioned authors investigated the possibility that atndr <dig> may control cell integrity through pm-cell wall adhesions. besides its well-characterized role as a key signaling component during pathogen attack, a broader function for ndr <dig> is strongly suggested by the data in mediating primary cellular functions in arabidospsis through maintenance of pm-cell wall connections  <cit> . from these unexpected results, the question arises as to whether or not candr1a could perform a similar function in c. arabica.

interestingly, upon inoculation with dc3000::avrrpt <dig>  successful activation of hr required ndr1-rin <dig> physical interaction. further examination using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis strategy revealed that two amino acid residues within the n-terminal part of ndr <dig> were necessary for the interaction  <cit> . despite the apparent lack of conservation of these two amino acid determinants within the candr1a end , our results showing that the coffee gene was able to restore rps2-mediated resistance in the ndr1- <dig> mutant tend to prove that candr1a does interact with atrin <dig> in our transgenic lines. thus, this raises the possibility that mechanism whereby ndr <dig> proteins exert their function could be conserved in arabidopsis and coffee plants.

consistent with this idea, searching for rin <dig> sequence homologs in the harvest© coffea database resulted in the identification of a candidate contig from coffea canephora. the deduced protein shows, within its n-terminal portion, a highly conserved region with the members of the rin <dig> family, as well as a putative conserved canonical avrrpt <dig> cleavage site . nonetheless, further experiments are needed to answer the question as to whether or not candr1a, like its arabidopsis ortholog, could serve as a pm anchor that indirectly recruits r-protein via its interaction with rin4-like intermediates   <cit> . split-ubiquitin and yeast two-hybrid systems, combined with bimolecular fluorescence complementation , would be useful tools for tackling this question. this might also be a faster and more convenient strategy, as opposed to classical genetic approaches, for the isolation of r-gene conferring resistance to h. vastatrix. to date, no coffee r-gene have been isolated despite the efforts of the coffee research community  <cit> . the reproductive barriers affecting genetic exchanges between diploid coffee species and the allopolyploid c. arabica have thus far prevented the successful isolation of the loci responsible for resistance to h. vastatrix through a map-based cloning strategy  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the functional and biochemical characterization of the orthologous ndr <dig> protein from c. arabica that we have carried out represents a crucial step towards the elucidation of the molecular events underpinning resistance to coffee rust. it should help identify new players in the coffee ndr1-dependent signaling pathway in the near future, and might thus be crucial for the engineering of transgenic coffee plants with broad spectrum resistance to h. vastatrix races. the development of efficient techniques to transform and propagate coffee varieties renders these biotechnological approaches feasible  <cit> .
