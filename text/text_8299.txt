BACKGROUND
the biosynthesis of secretory proteins requires translocation through the sec <dig> channel into the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . the protein conducting channel is formed by three proteins and is conserved in evolution from archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic cells  <cit> . the largest subunit forming the actual protein conducting channel is named sec61α in eukaryotes and secy in bacteria and archaea. the β-subunit is termed sec61β in metazoans and secg in bacteria and archaea, whereas in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  two homologous β-subunits, sbh1p and sbh2p exist. the γ-subunit is called sec61γ in mammalian cells, sss1p in s. cerevisiae cells and sece in bacteria and archaea. in s. cerevisiae two homologous trimeric sec <dig> complexes exist. the sec <dig> complex is composed of sec61p, sbh1p and sss1p  <cit> . this complex together with sec63p and kar2p functions in co-translational translocation  <cit> . in association with sec62p, sec63p, sec71p and sec72p, sec <dig> complex mediates also post-translational protein translocation as the so-called sec complex  <cit> . in addition to its role in co- and post-translational translocation, the sec <dig> complex has also been implicated in retro-translocation of misfolded proteins to the cytosol for degradation  <cit> . the second s. cerevisiae translocation complex, the ssh <dig> complex, consists of the sec61p homologue ssh1p, the sbh1p homologue sbh2p, and sss1p  <cit> . the ssh <dig> complex has been shown to contribute to both co- and post-translational translocation and er associated degradation   <cit> .

recent structural studies have shed light on the assembly and function of the α-subunit as the protein conducting channel  <cit> . in contrast, the functions of the β- and γ-subunits remain largely unclear. the β-subunit is not essential, but has a facilitating role in translocation in mammalian cells  <cit> . in addition to its interactions with sec61p, the mammalian β-subunit has been shown to interact with signal peptidase  <cit>  and the ribosome  <cit> . the yeast β-subunit, sbh1p, was shown to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for signal recognition particle receptor  <cit> . the two yeast β-subunits, sbh1p and sbh2p are encoded by non-essential genes. deletion of either gene alone has no effect on growth, while the deletion of both sbh <dig> and sbh <dig> results in temperature-sensitivity for growth  <cit> . different studies have reported variable effects of sbh <dig> and sbh <dig> deletion on protein translocation of the α mating pheromone precursor , kar2p, bacterial α-amylase and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase  <cit> . these results indicate a role for sbh1p in co-translational protein translocation. interestingly, the sbh1p tm-domain alone is sufficient to support in vivo co-translational protein translocation and for interactions with sec <dig> both in s. cerevisiae and in s. pombe  <cit> .

the non-essential role of sbh <dig> and sbh <dig>  in contrast to the essential genes encoding the α- and γ-subunits sec61p and sss1p, suggests that the β-subunits may have functions that are not directly linked to protein translocation. previously, a stabilizing role in the translocation complex has been suggested for both β- and γ-subunits  <cit> . both in mammalian and yeast cells, β-subunits have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the exocyst complex components sec8p, sec10p and sec15p  <cit>  whose main function is thought to be tethering of transport vesicles to the plasma membrane  <cit> . in addition, sbh <dig> over-expression has been shown to rescue the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of several exocyst subunit mutations  <cit> .

it appears that a pool of sbh1p exists outside sec <dig> complex and that these sbh1p proteins can interact with rtn1p, a member of the reticulon family proteins  <cit> . rtn1p, together with rtn2p and the dp1/yop1p family protein yop1p have been shown to function in modulation of the er membrane structure  <cit> . interestingly, in addition to its interactions with sbh1p, rtn1p has also been shown to co-purify with exocyst subunit sec <dig>  <cit> . collectively, the current data suggests that sbh1p displays complex molecular interactions and that its function may not be restricted to protein translocation. in this study we characterize the molecular determinants that are important for the function of the sec <dig> protein translocation complex β-subunit tm-domain function. in addition, we show that this β-subunit interacts with er-resident reticulon protein complexes.

RESULTS
characterization of sbh1p trans-membrane domain mutants
we have previously shown that the sbh1p tm-domain is capable of interacting with the sec61p-sss1p complex and sufficient to rescue the co-translational translocation defect in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells  <cit> . in order to identify regions in the sbh1p tm-domain that are important for its function we generated, by error-prone pcr, a dna library containing random mutations in the tm-domain encoding fragment. this library was transformed into the temperature-sensitive sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells, approximately  <dig> transformants were picked, and their capability to grow at the restrictive temperature was monitored. approximately 30% of the transformants could not grow at  <dig> °c, indicating that the sbh1p tm-domain had acquired mutations in functionally important amino acids. the plasmids from  <dig> non-functional and functional clones were subjected to sequencing. this revealed that most of the plasmids  contained mutations that resulted in one or more amino acid changes within the sbh1p tm-domain. the sbh <dig> mutants, which could not rescue temperature-sensitivity in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells, contained either an early stop codon or more than one amino acid changes. a selection of mutants is shown in table  <dig>  the results demonstrate that the sbh1p tm-domain tolerates a surprising number of non-conservative amino acid changes without a significant effect on sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cell growth.

recent studies have revealed high resolution secy-complex structures from different species  <cit> . while no high resolution structure of the eukaryotic sec <dig> translocation channel exists, a lower resolution structure of the mammalian non-translating ribosome-bound sec <dig> complex was recently obtained  <cit> . this structure, however, does not reveal details of the β-subunit. the sec <dig> β homologue secg is the least conserved subunit among secy complexes. in some species such as thermotoga maritima secg is comprised of two trans-membrane helices, whereas the structure of methanococcus jannaschii trimeric secy translocation complex reveals that the β-subunit traverses the membrane with a single α-helix with one side of the helix interacting with the α-subunit of the complex .

in order to understand where the obtained mutations are located in the sbh1p tm-domain structure, we made use of the similarity of secg tm-domains from different species and deduced a model for sbh1p association with sec61α . the tm-domains of sbh1p homologues have a highly conserved proline residue at the membrane/cytosol boundary complex  <cit> . we used this residue to align the sbh1p tm-domain with the methanococcus jannaschii secg tm-domain . the m. jannaschii secg tm-domain has one side of its tm domain facing the tm-domains  <dig> and  <dig> of secy . to test the effect of mutations in different locations of the sbh1p tm-domain α-helix, eight mutants were selected for further analysis . based on the model, mutations in tm- <dig>  tm- <dig>  tm- <dig> and tm- <dig> are mostly oriented away from the sec <dig> whereas mutations in tm- <dig>  tm- <dig>  tm- <dig> and tm- <dig> are facing sec <dig> . when tested for their capability to rescue the temperature-sensitivity of the sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells, mutants tm- <dig>  tm- <dig>  tm- <dig>  and tm- <dig> were unable to rescue temperature-sensitivity of this strain. mutant tm- <dig> was partially functional and mutants tm- <dig>  tm- <dig> and tm- <dig> displayed normal growth .

the sbh1p tm-domain is sufficient for co-purification with the two other subunits of the sec <dig> complex, sec61p and sss1p  <cit> . we next tested the effect of the selected mutations in the tm-domain for interaction with sec <dig>  as the tm-domain is only  <dig> amino acids long and not recognized by the antibodies available, for detection and pull-down experiments, we made use of the bio-tag derived from propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase that is biotinylated in vivo in yeast  <cit> . lysates were prepared from sbh1Δ cells that expressed, from a plasmid, different mutant variants of sbh1p tm-domain with a bio-tag. these lysates were subjected to pull-down experiments with streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads followed by sds-page and western blotting and detection with antibodies to sec61p or streptavidin conjugated hrp . the results show that the three mutants  that could not rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells, lose their interaction with sec61p. the tm- <dig> mutant protein levels were very low  and were excluded from this analysis. at the same time mutant tm- <dig> co-purified sec <dig> as efficiently as the wt sbh1p tm-domain. mutant tm- <dig> and tm- <dig> displayed reduced interaction with sec <dig>  mutant tm- <dig> that could rescue temperature-sensitivity of sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells could only weakly copurify sec <dig> .

the double mutation p54s v57g inactivates the sbh1p trans-membrane domain
sequence homology between tm-domains of mjsecg and sbh1p and our mutant collection suggest that mutations d53g, p54s, v57g, f64s, s67p, and v69a could affect potentially important positions within the sbh1p tm-domain. d <dig> is located at the cytosol/membrane boundary whereas p <dig>  v <dig> and f <dig> are conserved between m. jannaschii and s. cerevisiae. however, the single mutations d53g, p54s, v57g, f64s, s67p and v69a did not inactivate the sbh1p tm-domain as judged by the rescue of the temperature-sensitivity of sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells . based on the data indicating that one side of the predicted sbh1p tm-domain α-helix is especially sensitive for mutations, and on the sequence conservation within the sbh1p homologues, we generated, by site directed mutagenesis, versions of sbh1p that have p54s v57g mutations . these mutations target the side of sbh1p tm-domain α-helix that based on the secy structure  <cit>  would face sec61p . when expressed in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells this double mutant  was unable to rescue the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype at  <dig> °c whereas the single mutants p54s  and v57g  were as efficient as the wild type sbh <dig> to rescue the temperature-sensitive growth of sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells . the same was true when the bio-tagged versions of sbh <dig> were tested in this experimental setup . both untagged and bio-tagged full length  sbh1p containing both p54s and v57g mutations in the tm-domain were able to rescue sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cell growth at the restrictive temperature. this suggests that the cytosolic domain of sbh1p contributes to sbh1p function or interaction with sec <dig> enables sufficient in vivo functionality of sbh1p that has these mutations in the tm-domain.

sbh1p has previously been implicated in co-translational translocation . we therefore tested whether the p54s v57g double mutant is functional in protein translocation using the uta assay  <cit> . the uta assay measures coupling of translation to translocation by utilizing reporter proteins which contain a yeast signal sequence, a "spacer" peptide, ubiquitin and finally ura3p. when translation is closely coupled to translocation, the reporter protein fusion with ura3p is translocated to the lumen of the er before the ubiquitin folds and is cleaved by cytosolic proteases. such cells can not survive without uracil in the growth medium as ura3p needs to be in the cytosol to rescue lack of uracil in the growth medium. in cases where there is a delay between translation and translocation, ubiquitin folds, gets cleaved and ura3p is released in the cytosol enabling growth in the absence of uracil. thus, if sbh <dig> mutant proteins expressed in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells can not support translocation of the ura3p reporter protein into the er lumen the cells should be able to grow in the absence of uracil in the growth medium. this would indicate that this sbh1p mutant is inactivated for protein translocation. to test this sbh1Δ sbh2Δ leu2- <dig>  ura3- <dig> trp1Δ cells were transformed with reporter plasmids encoding invertase or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase b  signal sequence and  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  first amino acids, respectively, before the ubiquitin moiety and ura3p. the same cells were also transformed with plasmids encoding sbh1p tm-domain with single p54s  or v57g  or the p54s v57g double mutation  and with a plasmid encoding full length sbh1p with the p54s v57g double mutation  or the empty vector. suc2p uses the post-translational and dap2p the co-translational translocation pathway  <cit> . the sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells expressing suc <dig> grew in all cases in the absence of uracil in the growth medium as the  <dig> amino acid linker enables rapid folding of the ubiqutin moiety, its cleavage and release of the ura3p in the cytosol . the sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells expressing suc <dig> did not grow in the absence of uracil indicating efficient post-translational translocation of this reporter protein in to the er lumen in the absence of sbh <dig> and sbh <dig> proteins. dap <dig> reporter expressing sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells also grew in the absence of uracil  indicating a defect in co-translational translocation as previously reported  <cit> . the defect in co-translational translocation was rescued by reintroduction of full length sbh1p fl-dm, sbh1p tm sm <dig> or sbh1p tm sm <dig>  but not by expression of the sbh1p tm-domain with the p54s v57g double mutation  . we conclude that wt sbh1p, and the sbh1p tm-domain with the single p54s or v57g mutation can rescue the co-translational translocation defect in sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells whereas the sbh1p tm-domain with the double mutation p54s v57g cannot.

the sbh1p p54s v57g trans-membrane domain double mutant does not bind to sec61p
in order to test sec <dig> binding of the sbh1p tm-domain double mutant we made use of constructs which enabled expression of the point mutants with an amino-terminal bio tag . these constructs or an empty vector were transformed into sbh1Δ rtn1-3ha cells, lysates were prepared and subjected for pull-downs with streptavidin coated beads. the pull-downs were analyzed by sds-page and western blotting with antibodies against sec61p, ha or with hrp-coupled streptavidin. the results show that although similar amounts of sbh1tm-dm and sbh1tm were pulled down with streptavidin coated beads, the trans-membrane domain with p54s v57g mutations interacted only weakly with sec <dig> . at the same time, sec61p co-precipitated with full length sbh1p, sbh1p tm-domain and full length sbh1p fl. the p54s v57g mutations did not affect co-precipitation of sbh1p with rtn1p-ha . these results support the growth rescue and protein translocation experiment results and suggests that p <dig> v <dig> mutations affect interaction of the sbh <dig> tm-domain with sec61p. when these mutations are present in the full length sbh1p containing also the cytosolic domain, the interaction of sbh1p with sec61p is partially restored. this suggests the cytosolic domain contributes to the sbh1p interaction with sec <dig> 

the sbh1p trans-membrane domain is sufficient for interaction with rtn2p and yop1p
our previous results together with the results above showed that sbh1p is found in a complex with rtn1p and that the tm-domain is sufficient for this interaction . in addition to rtn1p, s. cerevisiae expresses two er-localized membrane proteins, rtn2p and yop1p that are implicated in er structure regulation  <cit> . in order to test whether also rtn2p and yop1p are found in protein complexes with sbh1p, yeast strains were generated where sbh <dig> was deleted and rtn <dig>  rtn <dig> or yop <dig> were tagged either with ha or myc tags at their genomic locus where their expression was maintained under their endogenous promoters. these cells were transformed with an empty plasmid or a plasmid expressing a bio-tagged version of either the full length sbh1p or the sbh1p tm-domain. cells were subjected to pull-down experiments with streptavidin coated beads and the precipitated material was analyzed after sds-page and western blotting with anti ha or myc antibodies. when sbh1p full length or the tm-domain was pulled-down from lysates expressing bio-sbh1p, bio-sbh1p-tm, rtn1p-ha, or rtn2p-myc, both rtn1p-ha and rtn2p-myc were detected in the precipitates together with sec61p. in cells harboring the empty vector instead of bio-sbh1p, only a weak signal for these proteins was detected . in lysates prepared from a strain expressing bio-sbh1p, bio-sbh1p-tm, rtn1p-ha, or yop1p-myc, both rtn1p-ha and yop1p-myc proteins co-purified with sbh1p . these results suggest that sbh1p interacts with a larger protein complex that appears to contain all yeast reticulon-homology proteins.

discussion
we previously showed that the tm-domain of the s. cerevisiae sec <dig> β-subunit sbh1p is sufficient to ensure viability of sbh <dig> sbh <dig> deleted cells, support co-translational translocation and interact with the α-subunit sec61p  <cit> . this indicates that the sbh1p tm-domain possesses features that ensure specific functional interactions with the sec <dig> protein translocation channel. currently, no high resolution structure exists for the eukaryotic sec <dig> complex and therefore it is not known how the β-subunit interacts with sec61p. however, recently high resolution structures of the archaeal and prokaryotic secy complexes have been resolved  <cit> . furthermore, a lower resolution structure of the mammalian sec <dig> complex bound to a non-translating ribosome was recently published  <cit> . this structure generated by electron microscopy is similar to the archaeal m. jannashii secy complex structure indicating high overall structural conservation between species. despite these significant advances, the detailed function of the protein translocation complex and especially the functions of the small secg/β and sece/γ subunits have remained elusive.

among the protein translocation channel subunits the different secg/β subunits are the least conserved by sequence making it difficult to define critical amino acids for their function. in order to gain a better understanding of the molecular determinants that are responsible for the s. cerevisiae sec <dig> β-subunit tm-domain in vivo function, we set out to identify mutations in the sbh1p tm-domain that could abolish its interaction with sec <dig> and that would affect co-translational protein translocation. we found that the sbh1p tm-domain tolerates significant changes in its amino acid composition with remarkably small effects on its function. when we used helical wheel projections to predict the distribution of these mutations, a pattern for the localization of inactivating mutations emerged. using the archaeal m. jannashii secy complex structure as a model, we observed that mutations on the side of sbh1p tm-domain that in secg would face secy were especially prone to inactive sbh1p function. this we confirmed by generating a version of sbh1p tm-domain containing two mutations that localized in the putative sbh1p-sec61p interaction interface. sbh1p tm-domains with these  mutations bound only weakly to sec61p and were unable to support co-translational translocation in the uta protein translocation assay . the p54s mutation changes a proline that is predicted to be located at the cytosol/membrane boundary. this mutation changes the sbh1p tm-domain to resemble its close homologue in s. cerevisiae, sbh2p, which naturally possesses a serine at this position  <cit> . sbh2p or its tm-domain alone have been shown to rescue the growth defect of sbh1Δ sbh2Δ cells  <cit> . this suggests that the v57g mutation is contributing significantly to inactivation of sbh1p function and sbh1p interaction with sec61p. this conclusion is supported e.g. by mutations  in the tm-domain mutant tm- <dig>  which cause inactivation of sbh1p. these mutations target the same side of the sbh1p tm-domain alpha-helix like the inactivating mutations p54s and v57g. both p <dig> and v <dig> are well conserved among secg and sec <dig> β homologues  <cit> . when p54s v57g mutations were generated in full length sbh1p, co-translational translocation was rescued sufficiently for cell survival at elevated temperature and the interaction with sec61p in immunoprecipitations was partially restored. it is therefore possible, that the cytosolic part of sbh1p contributes to sec <dig> binding or sec <dig> protein functionality either directly or indirectly through association of sec61p, the ribosome or other components involved.

the interactions displayed by the cytosolic domain are poorly understood as even in the solved high resolution structures of secyeg complexes, these domains are poorly resolved  <cit> . one potential interaction partner could be the closely situated amino-terminal part of sec61p  <cit> . additional interaction partners could be provided by the reported binding of sec <dig> complex subunits with the oligosaccharyl transferase complex  <cit> . ultimately, a high resolution structure of the sec <dig> complex is required to resolve the details of molecular interactions within this complex. however, our functional analysis of the sbh1p tm-domain indicates the side of the sec <dig> β-subunit tm-domain that is involved in sec61p binding in s. cerevisiae. this suggests that the sec <dig> β-subunit interaction with the sec <dig> α-subunit is indeed well conserved in evolution. this conclusion is supported by the recent results showing that both the mammalian and s. pombe sec <dig> β-subunits can complement for loss of sbh1p and sbh2p in s. cerevisiae  <cit> .

we have shown previously that sbh1p interacts with rtn1p, a member of the reticulon family of proteins in yeast  <cit> . this interaction appears to take place between sbh1p and rtn1p outside the sec <dig> complex  <cit> . rtn1p and reticulon family proteins in general have been shown to play an important role in modulation of er membrane tubulation both in s. cerevisiae and mammalian cells  <cit> . additional components in this function in yeast are the second reticulon family protein rtn2p and a member of the dp1/yop1p family, yop1p. yop <dig> and reticulon proteins rtn <dig> and rtn <dig> have been shown to form complexes of reduced lateral mobility in the peripheral er in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . here we show that sbh1p co-immunoprecipitates not only with rtn1p, but also with rtn2p and yop1p. our findings support the recent results showing that rtn1p, rtn2p and yop1p form trimeric complexes  <cit> . the role of sbh1p interaction with reticulon and yop <dig> complexes is currently unclear. however, the mutations that affected sbh1p interaction with sec61p did not abolish interaction with rtn1p.

we have previously shown that overexpression of sbh <dig> can specifically suppress the growth defect of several mutations in the exocyst complex  <cit> . in addition to these genetic interactions, sbh1p also co-immunoprecipitates with exocyst subunits sec15p and sec8p in yeast cells  <cit> . intriguingly, similar interactions and functional links were obtained in mammalian cells  <cit>  indicating that the sec <dig> β and exocyst complex interactions carry out a conserved function. association of the exocyst complex with er membrane components is further supported by data showing co-purification of the exocyst complex with rtn1p  <cit> . the existence of a functional link between rtn1p and the exocyst is also supported by the capability of rtn <dig> overexpression to suppress temperature-sensitive mutations in exocyst subunits sec5p and sec8p and induction of a cold sensitive phenotype in sec15- <dig> cells by rtn <dig> deletion . interestingly, recent results show a molecular interplay between sec5p, tbk <dig> kinase, a preferentially er-localized trans-membrane protein sting and sec <dig> β in mammalian cells. sting and tbk <dig> are implicated in innate immunity regulation and it was proposed that sting and the protein translocation channel are functionally linked during innate immunity signaling  <cit> . the exocyst subunit sec5p has also previously been shown to be involved in innate immunity through its interaction with tbk <dig> kinase and knock-down of the exocyst subunit sec5p renderes cells defective for sting function  <cit> . these results together with our present data on sec <dig> β-subunit interactions with reticulon/yop <dig> protein complexes, suggest a complex molecular interplay between er membrane proteins and the exocyst complex, possibly through interactions between the sec <dig> β-subunit, the exocyst complex and reticulon proteins. the elucidation of these interactions and their role in the cell represents an interesting, yet demanding challenge for future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our results support the existence of significant structural and functional conservation in sec <dig> β/secg subunits and show that sec <dig> β in s. cerevisiae associates with reticulon protein complexes. furthermore, these results suggest an interesting role for sec <dig> β in cellular regulation in addition to its role in protein translocation.
