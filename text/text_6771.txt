BACKGROUND
wolbachia are obligate endosymbiotic bacteria that are maternally transmitted through the egg cytoplasm and are responsible for several reproductive disorders in arthropods, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility  in infected culex mosquitoes  <cit>  and many other insects. although wolbachia are not found in mature sperm, they can modify developing sperm, possibly via chromatin binding proteins  <cit> , such that when they fertilise an uninfected egg embryonic development is arrested. the reciprocal cross between infected females and uninfected males is, however, compatible; wolbachia-infected females therefore produce a higher mean number of offspring than uninfected females. this unidirectional ci enables wolbachia to rapidly invade uninfected populations  <cit> , and provides a mechanism for driving anti-pathogen transgenes or a lifespan-shortening phenotype into mosquito populations  <cit> . bidirectional ci can also occur between insect populations, usually when they are infected with different strains of wolbachia.

the genome sequence of the wmel strain  <cit> , a ci-inducing wolbachia strain found in drosophila melanogaster, revealed an unusually high number of ankyrin repeat domain  encoding genes. ankyrin repeats, consisting of around  <dig> residues, have been identified in a large number of proteins  <cit> . ankyrin repeats are known to mediate protein-protein interactions in eukaryotes and are present in proteins involved in very different functions including cell cycle regulation, mitochondrial enzymes, cytoskeleton interactions, signal transduction and toxins  <cit> . although ankyrin repeats are common in both eukaryotic and viral proteins they are relatively rare in bacteria and their function remains largely unknown. a protein containing ankyrin repeats in the bacterium ehrlichia phagocytophila was detected in the host cytoplasm and found to be associated with chromatin suggesting a possible role in host cell gene expression  <cit> . ank proteins have also been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions in cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitors. in nasonia wasps, the control of host cell cycle timing at karyogamy appears to be disrupted in ci and inhibition of cdk <dig> has been proposed as a possible mechanism  <cit> . taken together this has led to the suggestion that ank genes could play a role in wolbachia-induced ci  <cit> .

species in the cx. pipiens complex display an extremely high number of wolbachia-induced crossing types between populations, with a high frequency of uni- or bidirectional incompatibilities  <cit> . despite the complexity of crossing types, no polymorphism in the wpip strain of wolbachia, responsible for ci in cx. pipiens mosquitoes, has been found in the nucleotide sequences of ftsz  <cit>  and 16s rrna  <cit>  or in the highly variable wsp gene  <cit> . sequencing of the wpip genome was undertaken partly in order to attempt to resolve this discrepancy. interestingly, sequence analysis of some ank genes found in wpip revealed variation in both nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence for two prophage associated ank genes, pk <dig> and pk <dig>  between wpip-infected cx. pipiens colonies  <cit> . the wau strain of wolbachia, found in drosophila simulans, is closely related to the wmel strain but does not normally induce ci  <cit> . the homolog of pk <dig> in wau contains a premature stop codon not present in the wmel homolog, which suggests it could be a candidate gene for involvement in ci in drosophila  <cit> .

variable expression between sexes and strains of cx. pipiens was detected for the pk <dig> gene, a characteristic that might be expected for genes involved in the specific modification and rescue functions between incompatible strains. any differential expression of ank genes between male and female wpip infected adult cx. pipiens mosquitoes would suggest an important function of these genes in the interaction between wolbachia and its insect host. how wolbachia differentially modify sperm in males as well as rescue in females is as yet unknown, but could potentially involve variability in the expression and activity of wolbachia genes in male and female insect hosts. variable gene expression in wolbachia is not thought to occur at a high rate, as only a small number of regulatory genes have been identified in the wolbachia genomes sequenced to date  <cit> . in this study, we analysed the expression profile of all ank genes in wpip in cx. pipiens adult mosquitoes.

RESULTS
number and distribution of wpip ank genes
analysis of the wpip genome revealed  <dig> ank genes, which are numbered sequentially in table  <dig>  several ank proteins have predicted signal peptides and transmembrane domains. thirteen of the wpip ank genes are contained in several chromosomally integrated prophage regions, similar in sequence to the wmel wo-b prophage region  <cit> . the ank genes pk <dig> and pk <dig>  homologues of the wmel genes wd <dig> and wd <dig> respectively and previously shown to vary between incompatible culex strains  <cit> , are here shown to be present in multiple identical copies in different prophage regions: wpip_ank <dig>  wpip_ank <dig> and wpip_ank <dig> in the case of pk <dig> and wpip_ank <dig> and wpip_ank <dig> in the case of pk <dig>  two sequence variants of pk <dig> in wpip from different cx. pipiens group colonies have been previously described and were named a and b. the wpip_ank <dig> gene is also homologous to the pk <dig> genes/wd <dig> in the wmel strain and is present in wpip in all the infected cx. pipiens group colonies listed. a third pair of identical prophage-associated genes are also present, wpip_ank <dig> and wpip_ank <dig>  which are homologues of wd <dig>  thus in total there are  <dig> unique ank genes present in the wpip genome.

the number of ank domains as identified by pfam, gene length , the wmel and wbm homologous gene where there this can be clearly determined. symbols # , * and + denote groups of prophage-associated genes with identical sequences.

only  <dig> of the  <dig> wmel ank genes have clear homologues in the wpip genome, which might reflect the high degree of heterogeneity in this group of genes. thus, when likely paralogous groups  and identical copies are taken into account,  <dig> of the  <dig> identified wpip ank genes in the wpip genome do not have any clear homologues in the wmel genome. by way of comparison, the wbm strain of wolbachia, thought to be a nutritional mutualist in the filarial nematode brugia malayi, encodes only five ank proteins  <cit> , three of which are homologous to the wpip ank encoding genes.

ank gene expression
transcripts were detected for all of the ank encoding genes. for the majority, expression in adult males and females of the pel colony was not obviously different based on agarose gel electrophoresis of rt-pcr products. the wpip_ank <dig> gene showed very low expression in pel female extracts and no detectable expression in pel male rna extracts. wpip_ank <dig> and wpip_ank <dig> showed low levels of expression in both pel male and female rna extracts. rt-pcr analysis also suggested that wpip_ank <dig> is highly expressed in both sexes.

wpip_ank <dig> and wpip_ank25
the identical prophage associated ank encoding genes wpip_ank <dig> and wpip_ank <dig>  previously together named pk <dig>  <cit> , showed the greatest difference in expression between sexes, with no detectable rt-pcr products in the males of the pel and mol colonies. expression of these genes was also not detected in males for an additional cx. pipiens colony from sri lanka . quantification of expression by quantitative reverse transcription  was carried out and the mean male expression of the pk <dig> gene in the pel colony in comparison to female expression was  <dig> % . however, expression of pk <dig> was observed at similar levels in males and females of the col colony. primers were designed to discriminate between pk <dig> sequence variants pk2a present in the pel, sumo and mol colonies and pk2b present in the col colony and confirmed no detectable expression of pk2a from male rna extracts of the pel, sumo cyppe and mol colonies using rt-pcr . the pk2b gene variant was expressed at similar levels in col colony adult females and males. further rt-pcr analysis showed pk <dig> gene expression in both preblastoderm embryos and pooled 4th instar larvae  of the pel colony. pk <dig> expression in pooled testes from  <dig> pel males was just detectable but the rt-pcr product was very weak compared to those for wsp and pk <dig> .

differential expression between sexes was also observed for two genes directly downstream of pk <dig> . pk2- <dig> encodes a hypothetical protein present in identical copies in the two pk <dig> associated prophage regions. pk2- <dig> encodes a site-specific recombinase present in almost identical copies in the two prophage regions. primers used for expression studies could not discriminate between the pk2- <dig> copies. for the gene upstream of pk <dig>  also an ank encoding gene present in two identical copies , rt-pcr followed by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed similar expression levels in both female and male rna extracts of the pel colony. primers designed to span the intergenic regions of pk2/pk2-1/pk2- <dig> produced rt-pcr products from females but no detectable products from males of the pel colony. primers spanning the intergenic region between pk <dig> and pk2+ <dig>  produced no amplification of a transcript from either female or male rna extracts of the pel colony. however, using the same primers, a product of correct size  was amplified in both male and female dna extracts of the pel colony.

wpip_ank16
the pk2/wd <dig> homolog wpip_ank <dig> was present in all the culex strains tested based on pcr amplification. in the pel, mol and sumo cyppe colonies, wpip_ank <dig> was expressed equally in males and females; however for the col colony no expression could be detected in males, and only a weak rt-pcr product could be detected in females .

wpip_ank1
standard rt-pcr analysis followed by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed much lower expression levels of wpip_ank <dig> from pooled male rna extracts of all wpip-infected culex colonies in comparison to female rna extracts. quantification of expression by qrt-pcr was undertaken and the mean male normalized expression of the wpip_ank <dig> gene in pel males relative to pel female expression was  <dig> % . expression levels were similar in pel females and males for both genes flanking wpip_ank <dig>  based on standard rt-pcr followed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

wpip_ank52
expression analysis using rt-pcr followed by gel electrophoresis revealed lower expression levels of wpip_ank <dig> from pooled male rna extracts of all wpip-infected cx. pipiens colonies in comparison to female rna extracts. quantification of expression by qrt-pcr was undertaken and the mean male normalized expression of the wpip_ank <dig> gene in pel males relative to pel female expression was 19% . reduced expression levels were also observed in pel male rna extracts for three additional genes flanking wpip_ank <dig> based on standard rt-pcr followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. however, although standard pcr using primers to span the intergenic regions of these genes resulted in an amplified product of approximately  <dig>  kb, no products were amplified using rt-pcr from either pel female or male rna extracts.

discussion
the presence of  <dig> ank genes is significantly more than the  <dig> identified in the wmel genome  <cit> ; in fact, the number and density of ank genes is the highest reported for any prokaryotic genome. the expansion of ank genes in the wpip strain, the degree of sequence variability and sex-specific expression in adult cx. pipiens mosquitoes suggests an important biological role in parasitic strains of wolbachia. the rt-pcr analysis provides strong evidence for a single transcriptional unit  produced from three prophage associated genes including pk <dig>  however, there was no evidence that wpip_ank <dig> and wpip_ank <dig> are part of sex-specifically regulated operons.

the quantitative rt-pcr analysis in this study represents only an estimation of differences in relative ank gene expression. the accurate quantification of rna expression in bacteria has been limited due to the absence of reliable standardization. in eukaryotic cells, stably expressed housekeeping genes can be used as standards to perform relative quantification of gene expression. for an endosymbiotic bacterium such as wolbachia, comparing the expression of ankyrin genes to the surface protein encoding gene  was used to normalize for variation in wolbachia density but any differences in levels of wsp expression between sexes and stages could be a confounding factor. the wsp gene was previously shown to be expressed in all cx. pipiens life stages including male and female adults  <cit> .

as some of the ank proteins have predicted signal peptides and transmembrane domains, it is possible that they are secreted into the mosquito cytoplasm or presented on the surface of the bacterium, which could suggest that they are involved in wolbachia's interaction with the host. a proteomics analysis including experiments such as immunolocalisation studies could be used to characterize the function of ank proteins in wolbachia. current limitations to such studies include the difficulty of obtaining epitope specificity and the absence of a transformation system for wolbachia. as co-regulated genes are highly likely to show functional interactions, studies to examine the role of the co-expressed prophage-associated genes adjacent to pk <dig> are also needed.

associations between ank gene sequence variants and particular crossing types have previously been reported  <cit> , enabling use of these variants as markers to further investigate wolbachia-induced ci in the cx. pipiens group. the significance of sex-specific expression patterns in the pk <dig> genes in some host strains but not others is not yet understood, but its occurrence did not correlate with the crossing patterns described in table  <dig>  the mol and pel colonies are bidirectionally incompatible with each other but both show the same sex-specific expression of the pk <dig> genes in adult mosquitoes. given the complexity of the phenotype in the cx. pipiens group, it seems plausible or even probable that the genetic basis for these crossing type differences involves multiple wolbachia genes, and factors such as the mosquito nuclear background interacting with wolbachia variants can also contribute  <cit> . a hypothesis that variation at just one 'ci gene' could explain all the crossing type variation observed seems increasingly unlikely. given the rapid evolution of ank genes, sequence differences at particular ank loci between crossing types does not necessarily mean that there is a causal link. however the differential expression between sexes of several ank genes  in wpip does provide further support for adaptations to sex-specific interactions with its host.

CONCLUSIONS
the number of ank genes in the wpip genome is the highest yet reported in a prokaryote. the sex-specificity observed in patterns of expression for some of these genes and the differential expression between mosquito strains are also very unusual features, particularly given the generally very high level of sequence conservation between wpip variants. the elucidation of the functional roles and mechanisms of evolution of this family of genes will provide many insights into the biology of reproductive parasites.
