BACKGROUND
magnaporthe oryzae is the causal agent of rice blast, the most threatening disease of cultivated rice worldwide. spores of this filamentous ascomycete fungus, after landing on the leaf surface, form a germination tube. this tube senses the hydrophobicity and hardness of the host surface resulting in the formation of a penetration structure called an appressorium  <cit> . the accumulation of melanin in the appressorium cell wall and subsequent increase of glycerol levels in its interior generates high turgor pressure  <cit> , which then leads to the formation of a penetration peg, a specialized hypha that is responsible for puncturing the plant epidermis and entering the plant cell  <cit> . once inside the host, the fungus forms intracellular invasive hyphae , from which filamentous hyphae emerge and follow a cell-to-cell growth pattern  <cit> . as a hemi-biotrophic organism, m. oryzae initially develops an intimate relationship with its host and in compatible interactions is presumably able to deal with any defenses the host may mount. subsequently, host cells die resulting in characteristic "blast" disease symptoms.

over the last decade, research in m. oryzae has largely focused on the morphological and physiological development of the fungus in the pre-penetration and penetration phases as reviewed by howard and valent  <cit> . genome-wide gene expression analyses of m. oryzae have examined early-stage events, including spore germination and appressorium formation on a hydrophobic surface and in response to cyclic amp induction  <cit> . other studies have focused on a single element in isolation, such as response to nitrogen-starvation, or effects of single gene mutation  <cit> . recent studies have examined the early invasive phase of the pathogen within the plant cells, revealing intriguing results on the truly hemi-biotrophic nature of this fungus  <cit> . a transcriptome analysis of m. oryzae at an early stage of invasive growth  identified a number of so-called biotrophy-associated secreted proteins  <cit> . on the other hand, there is a paucity of information on the challenges the fungus potentially faces during invasive growth in the host environment. furthermore, very little is known about global gene expression changes when the fungus is exposed to various environmental stresses. we postulate that m. oryzae must have evolved mechanisms for coping with various host conditions--some potentially stressful--as infection progresses. some of the earliest plant responses upon pathogen attack are the production of reactive nitrogen species  and reactive oxygen species . high levels of these substances can be extremely toxic and can cause oxidative damage to dna, rna, lipids, and proteins if not catalyzed by the cell  <cit> . evidence supporting the idea that plant pathogens encounter rns and ros comes, for example, from the barley obligate biotroph fungus, blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei, from which the synthesis and secretion of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalases and peroxidases, was observed during germ tube invasion in a compatible interaction  <cit> .

the search for nutrients is also a challenge faced by pathogens during host infection  <cit> . during in planta growth and development of filamentous intracellular hyphae, a close relationship with host cells is formed, enabling the uptake of nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen by the pathogen, as well as secretion of proteins into host cells  <cit> . in m. oryzae, nitrogen availability appears to regulate pathogenicity. npr <dig> and npr <dig>  regulators of nitrogen utilization  <cit>  also regulate mpg <dig>  which encodes a small hydrophobic protein. mpg <dig>  which is required for pathogenicity, is induced under carbon and nitrogen limiting conditions and during in planta growth. these data suggest that m. oryzae encounters nutrient limitation during infection. other evidence for the nutrient challenge faced by plant pathogens was shown by voegele and colleagues  <cit> . they identified a hexose transporter  that is localized in the haustorial plasma membrane and highly expressed in the haustoria of the rust fungus uromyces fabae, a common pathogen of beans. the hxt <dig> has high affinity for d-glucose and d-fructose substrates, suggesting that these sugars are taken up by the haustorium during the fungus-plant interaction.

one strategy to explore the likely environmental challenges faced by the fungus during later stages of host invasive growth is to analyze the global transcriptome of the pathogen during growth in planta compared to growth during in vitro stresses. we hypothesize that the function of genes, which have common expression patterns during in planta infection and in vitro stresses, will likely represent the molecular mechanisms the fungus utilizes for successfully coping with its host environment. we used microarrays to examine the expression of approximately  <dig>  m. oryzae genes during in planta compatible growth  and in vitro stresses  compared to fungal mycelia grown in complete medium . we generated a robust and diverse dataset that had not yet existed for m. oryzae, which we then analyzed to identify genes commonly induced or repressed in combinations of treatments. the data are further discussed in the context of gene functionality, their role in fungal physiology during in planta invasive growth and the utility of this dataset for hypothesis-building.

RESULTS
microarray data analyses and validation
our primary interest in undertaking this gene expression profiling experiment was to ascertain whether gene expression patterns during in planta invasive growth were similar to in vitro stress conditions, and which condition most closely mimicked that of in planta invasive growth. to this end, we performed microarray experiments with rna samples collected from eight conditions, two from in planta invasive growth in two-week old rice  and barley  leaves at  <dig> hpi , and six from m. oryzae axenic cultures grown in complete medium and then subjected to temperature up shift at  <dig> °c  for  <dig> minutes, oxidative stress using  <dig> mm of the oxidative agent paraquat  for  <dig> hours, minimal medium , carbon-limited minimal medium , and nitrogen-limited minimal medium . we chose to examine  <dig> hpi because this is the most likely stage at which invasive growth is occurring; that is, the fungus spreads to adjacent epidermal cells and the first visible signs of disease begin to appear  <cit> . we based our choices for the in vitro experiments on a combination of preliminary data and previously published studies. for example, the time-point and temperature for ts was chosen based upon a published study on chaperone-related gene changes in m. oryzae subjected to a heat shock of  <dig> °c longer than  <dig> minutes,  <cit>  as well as prior experiments that looked at induction of hsp <dig> .

m. oryzae grown in complete medium was used as the reference condition for each hybridization experiment . the microarray data were analyzed using the limma software package . the probes were considered to represent significantly differentially expressed transcripts if they had a minimum of two-fold expression, either up or down, in relation to the reference in at least one of the treatments , and presence of a mgg number in version six of the m. oryzae genome annotation database  <cit> . using these criteria, we identified  <dig>  genes differentially expressed among the conditions tested when compared to the reference sample . the rice, barley and mm-c treatments had more induced than repressed genes while the opposite was observed for the other in vitro treatments . similarly, rice, barley, mm-c, and mm-n had more unique genes being differentially expressed than ts, pq and mm .

*r , b , ts , pq , mm , mm-c , and mm-n . fc . in parenthesis is showed the percentage from the total number of genes in the genome .

in order to validate the microarray results, we selected  <dig> genes that were either induced or repressed in all treatments and measured the difference in expression of these genes in relation to m. oryzae grown in complete medium  with quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction . the averaged matching between the microarray and qrt-pcr data was approximately 73% . four of the  <dig> genes did not match the microarray results and, in fact, provided exactly opposite results with high variability in the expression levels. we suspected that either the primers used in the qrt-pcr amplified other cdnas or that the microarray probes cross-hybridized to other unexpected transcripts, although the former possibility is unlikely, given that we blasted all of the primer sequences to the m. oryzae database, and they only returned one correct hit to the gene of interest. after excluding those four genes, the overall percentage of matches between the two technologies was approximately 90% .

in order to identify fungal gene expression patterns from the in vitro treatments that were most similar to gene expression in planta, we further sorted the  <dig>  differentially expressed gene set. genes were grouped together if they had significant expression in rice and/or barley and at least one other in vitro condition, which resulted in  <dig>  genes. hierarchical clustering of this subset of genes revealed three major clusters . the first grouped the in vitro treatments pq, ts and mm, the second grouped the in planta treatments rice and barley, and the third grouped the nutrient-limited treatments mm-c and mm-n. overall, we found that fungal gene expression in rice and barley more closely grouped with mm-c and mm-n, than the other in vitro stress conditions. heat maps are shown for the smaller  <dig> -gene dataset, as well as the "meta-dataset" of  <dig>  genes . clustering of the meta-dataset revealed that fungal gene expression in planta was more disparate from any of the in vitro conditions, but was still closer to the nutrient-limited conditions, as indicated by the length of the tree branch.

m. oryzae genes differentially expressed in all treatments
we also wished to know whether any genes shared expression patterns among all seven conditions and the reference condition. from the  <dig>  genes,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were commonly induced and repressed in all treatments . from the  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed genes,  <dig> and  <dig> genes have known function, respectively. the genes with unknown function were subjected to blast searches at ncbi and the results are included in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the  <dig> and  <dig> genes were grouped into categories based on their cellular function using gene ontology . under the stringent criterion of being induced in all seven conditions, we noted a higher percentage of induced genes involved in carbon metabolism, oxidation-reduction reactions and membrane metabolism than in any other category . interestingly, there were no nitrogen metabolism-related genes that were induced in all seven conditions. genes with putative roles in stress responses showed equal numbers being induced and repressed, as was also the case for genes involved in cell cycle. among the induced genes in all conditions there were two glutathione s-transferases , enzymes that play a role in cellular detoxification in yeast  <cit> ; an endo  <dig> -β xylanase  and a cutinase , enzymes involved in plant cell wall  <cit>  and cutin  <cit>  degradation in m. oryzae, respectively; and a homologue of the pisatin demethylase gene  which, in the pea  fungus nectria haematococca, is involved in the detoxification of the phytoalexin pisatin  <cit> . analyses of the pisatin amino acid sequence of pd and mgg_ <dig>  revealed the presence of a ligand binding site that is present in the cytochrome p <dig> protein family, suggesting that mgg_ <dig>  is another member of this protein family  <cit> .

1list sorted in descending fold-change in the rice treatment. r: rice at  <dig> hpi; b: barley at  <dig> hpi; ts: temperature up shift, pq: paraquat, mm: minimal medium, mm-c: carbon limitation, mm-n: nitrogen limitation. the adjusted p-values for these genes are <  <dig> .

1list sorted in ascending fold-change in the rice treatment. r: rice at  <dig> hpi; b: barley at  <dig> hpi; ts: temperature up shift, pq: paraquat, mm: minimal medium, mm-c: carbon limitation, mm-n: nitrogen limitation. the adjusted p-values for these genes are <  <dig> .

among the repressed genes was a methyltransferase , a sugar transporter , an acetyltransferase , two putative mfs transporters , a secretory phospholipase a <dig> , and a putative linoleate diol synthase .

in order to examine overlapping gene expression profiles between in planta expression and individual in vitro stresses, we generated area-proportional venn diagrams of induced and repressed genes for rice, barley and each of the in vitro treatments , along with diagrams showing overlap among the nutrient-limited conditions .

m. oryzae genes expressed in planta and in temperature up shift condition
the temperature up shift condition was included for two reasons: first, we wished to explore the molecular mechanisms that m. oryzae uses to adjust to a rapid change in temperature and second, we wished to determine whether any of these mechanisms were similar to those exploited in planta. thus, the list containing the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes was sorted for genes that were either induced or repressed in rice, barley, and ts. this resulted in the identification of  <dig> commonly induced and  <dig> commonly repressed genes . from those  <dig> induced genes,  <dig> genes have known functions and among them were several stress-related genes, such as a stress-responsive gene , a superoxide dismutase , a glutathione-dependent redox enzyme , and a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd . the three latter enzymes are known to be involved in antioxidant defense in yeast  <cit> .

out of the  <dig> repressed genes, only  <dig> genes have known functions and among them were a ph-response regulator , a translational regulator , a transcriptional regulator hac <dig> , a manganese resistance gene , and a cell division cycle gene . remarkably, no putative heat shock or chaperone-related genes were present in the  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed gene lists, which might be due to the need for higher heat shock temperatures or their differential expression might occur at a time point different than the one selected for this experiment.

m. oryzae genes expressed in planta and in paraquat-induced oxidative stress
from the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes, we identified  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed genes in rice, barley, and pq treatments . from those  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes have known functions. notably, one of the induced genes was a glutathione s-transferase , which was also induced in mm-c and mm-n. additional noteworthy genes were a peroxiredoxin type- <dig> gene , a regulatory protein alcr , a polyketide synthase , and a norsolorinic acid reductase homologue . norsolorinic acid reductase is a polyketide precursor of the aflatoxin b <dig>  which is produced in certain strains of aspergillus flavus and a. parasiticus  <cit> .

among the repressed genes in planta and in pq was a general amino acid permease gap <dig> , a homologue of s. cerevisiae which was shown to be involved in the uptake of the proline analogue azetidine-2-carboxylate, which can be incorporated into proteins competitively with proline and can misfold proteins and be toxic to the cells  <cit> . a gtp-binding protein ypt <dig>  and a protease ulp <dig>  were also present in the dataset. the yeast ulp <dig> protein was reported to be involved in maintenance of unspliced mrna in the nucleus  <cit> . however, to our knowledge the additional role of this vital mechanism during fungal invasive growth has not been addressed.

m. oryzae genes expressed in planta and in nutrient limitation
from the original set of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes, we sorted the data for genes that exhibited common expression patterns between rice, barley, and one of the three nutritional conditions: minimal medium , carbon-limited minimal medium , and nitrogen-limited minimal medium .

genes expressed in r, b, and mm
there were  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed genes among rice, barley, and mm . from the  <dig> induced genes,  <dig> have known functions; two of which were a zinc metalloprotease  and a high affinity copper transporter . among the  <dig> repressed genes, only  <dig> have known functions. interestingly, a dna damage response protein kinase dun <dig> gene , a udp-n-acetylglucosamine transporter yea <dig> , a gtpase-activating gyp <dig> , and a gtp-binding ypt <dig>  gene were down-regulated. in yeast, the gyp <dig> protein activates the rab family of proteins, of which ypt <dig> is a member, and this protein is involved in vesicle-mediated protein trafficking in exocytosis and endocytosis  <cit> .

genes expressed in rice, barley, and mm-c
the rice, barley, and mm-c treatments revealed  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed genes, from which  <dig> and  <dig> genes have known functions, respectively . among the induced genes, there were several transporters including a lactose permease , a quinate permease  and three maltose permease mal31genes . several other noteworthy up-regulated genes included, a peroxisomal  <dig> -dienoyl-coa reductase sps <dig> , an aquaporin- <dig> aqy <dig> , a glycerol kinase gut <dig> , and a sorbose reductase . in yeast cells, aqy <dig> is correlated with freeze tolerance  <cit>  and gut1is induced under several stress conditions  <cit> . cytochrome p <dig>  genes are known to be involved in fungal adaptation to new niches, which would likely include overcoming stressful environments  <cit> . we found three cyp's in our dataset , which showed the same general trend of having increased expression in barley along with the mm-c conditions. we further observed that an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene  was among the list of induced genes in all treatments and that an alcohol oxidase gene  was highly induced in rice, barley, and mm-c.

among the repressed genes in rice, barley, and mm-c were a glutamine synthetase gln <dig> , a magnesium transporter alr <dig> , and a putative acetolacetate synthase ilv <dig> . the latter is involved in isoleucine and valine biosynthesis and has been of interest as a target for antifungal products  <cit> .

genes expressed in rice, barley, and mm-n
there were  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed genes, from which  <dig> and  <dig> genes have known functions, respectively , among the rice, barley and mm-n conditions. among the induced genes, there was a glucosamine 6-phosphate n-acetyltransferase gna <dig> , a vacuolar aminopeptidase lap <dig> , a mitochondrial peroxiredoxin prx <dig> , and a general amino acid permease agp <dig> . another general amino acid permease, agp <dig> , was induced only in mm-n.

in our dataset, a pectate lyase gene  was induced in rice, barley, and mm-n, and very slightly induced in mm-c . another pectate lyase  was only induced in barley. fungal pectate lyases  are involved in plant cell wall degradation. in necrotrophic pathogens, pels have been shown to be required for partial or full virulence, whereas biotrophic pathogens have fewer cell wall degrading enzymes . among the repressed genes, there was a nad-dependent deacetylase sirtuin  <dig> , an arrestin , and an aspartate aminotransferase aat <dig> . the m. oryzae gene mpg <dig> , encoding a hydrophobin protein, was induced in rice, barley, mm-c, and mm-n treatments as previously observed by talbot and colleagues  <cit> .

m. oryzae genes expressed only in rice and/or in barley
we identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were specifically induced or repressed, respectively, in rice and/or barley. from these sets,  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed genes were shared by rice and barley. among the  <dig> induced genes there were several cwdes, putative secreted proteins, and different types of membrane transporters. we also observed that a mas <dig> gene , a cutinase gene , an endoglucanase gene , and an exoglucanase gene  were induced. three out of the four biotrophy-associated secreted  genes identified by mosquera and colleagues  <cit>  at  <dig> hours post-inoculation were among the genes only induced during in planta infection of rice and barley. five membrane transporters were present in the list of induced genes, which were an ammonium transporter , an organic anion transporter , a malic acid transporter , an abc-type fe3+ transporter , and an abc transporter cdr <dig> . two other genes, an alcohol  and an aldehyde dehydrogenase  were induced only in rice and barley, which further suggests the importance of such classes of genes for invasive growth.

among the repressed genes there was a multidrug and toxin extrusion gene , a serine/threonine protein kinase sapk <dig> gene , and a mitochondrial rho gtpase  <dig> gene .

expression patterns of known pathogenicity genes
we examined the data set for known pathogenicity genes. given that we chose a time-point more indicative of invasive growth , we did not expect to find many genes solely associated with pre-penetration and penetration since these events are complete by  <dig> hpi. however, nine pathogenicity genes were identified with common expression profiles in rice or barley and at least one other condition . all of the genes, with the exception of the mgaox gene , which encodes an alternative oxidase and is only induced during the in vitro conditions, were induced in one or both plant hosts along with mm-c and/or mm-n. the expression profiles for mpg <dig>  and spm <dig>  support their previous roles in both virulence and growth during nitrogen limitation  <cit> . cut <dig>  was the only pathogenicity gene that is uniquely induced during in planta growth in both rice and barley at  <dig> hpi.

expression patterns of cell wall degrading enzymes
our data strongly suggested that at  <dig> hpi, m. oryzae activates a cadre of plant cwdes. this group of enzymes may play a role in fungal cell to cell movement and/or utilize the breakdown products as a nutrient source. from our list of  <dig>  genes, we identified ten genes predicted to be involved in xylan breakdown and ten in cellulose breakdown, and examined their expression patterns. with the exception of two genes , all had induced expression in at least one of the plant hosts  and in at least one of the in vitro conditions. of the predicted cellulose degradation genes, a neutral α-glucosidase had increased expression in all conditions . of the predicted xylanase genes, two had increased expression in every condition, an endo- <dig> -β xylanase  and a β-xylosidase . interestingly, mgg_ <dig>  was the most highly expressed gene in barley, and the fifth most highly expressed gene in rice. while it is difficult to predict what their role might be during the in vitro growth conditions, high expression of the putative cellulases and xylanases in planta at  <dig> hpi strongly implies that m. oryzae is breaking down plant cell walls during invasive growth, which will need further scientific confirmation.

time-course of gene expression in barley
in order to further characterize genes from our microarray dataset, we chose a subset of genes from additional file  <dig>  for profiling during a time-course of infection on barley. we chose three genes that were induced in all conditions, mas <dig> , sod  and a xylanase gene . we also chose five genes that were repressed in all conditions, endothiapepsin , hsp <dig> , urea active transporter , glutamine synthetase  and cutinase . all eight genes were profiled using real-time qrt-pcr, with gapdh as the endogenous control . interestingly, all five of these genes that were down-regulated in most conditions, were also down-regulated during the  <dig> hour time-course on barley; the exceptions were cutinase and endothiapepsin, which both showed induction at  <dig> hpi, but then fell off by the  <dig> hour time point. each of the three induced genes peaked at a different time-point; mas <dig> showed the highest level of expression at  <dig> hpi, sod at  <dig> hpi and xylanase at  <dig> hpi. the fold changes of all three genes matched their microarray profiles for the barley condition, providing yet another confirmation of our microarray dataset.

discussion
we hypothesized that the rice blast fungus must be able to grow in, and overcome, an inhospitable environment during invasive growth , including foraging for nutrients and coping with plant defense responses. more specifically, we anticipated observing clustering of gene expression predominantly among the in planta conditions , the nutrient deprived conditions  and the reactive oxygen species condition . the hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that our hypothesis was at least partially correct in that the strongest relationship between gene expression in rice and barley was with gene expression in mm-c and mm-n. the pq condition was more closely related to the mm and ts conditions, and the latter two were the most closely related to each other. overall, these findings indicated that m. oryzae is likely coping with limited nutrient availability during the invasive growth stage , and less so with host defense responses , or a condition analogous to temperature up shift. it is possible that genes involved in oxidative stress would respond more similarly to in planta infection if they were sampled at a different time point. similarly, a temperature shift may more likely occur earlier in the infection cycle upon the pathogen first entering the leaf. we were surprised to find no significantly induced heat shock or chaperone-like genes induced during this condition. however, a similar experiment was recently performed in m. oryzae to examine expression of two hsp <dig> genes; the authors examined transcript levels at the same temperature we used, 42°c, across  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes. gene levels did not change appreciably from the control samples however one gene's expression decreased when the fungus was exposed to 42°c for longer periods of time  <cit> . of the thirteen predicted hsp <dig> family members in m. oryzae, we found three with increased expression in our nutrient-limited or barley dataset , but not in our temperature up-shift dataset. interestingly, mgg_ <dig> , which is the kar2p yeast homolog, is slightly induced during infection of barley and from the study mentioned above and appears to be an essential gene in this fungus  <cit> . together, these data suggest the hypothesis that it takes m. oryzae a longer period of time to adjust to the heat shock than we had anticipated and that some hsp's likely play a role in nutrient-limitation and in planta growth, as opposed to increased temperatures.

we cannot rule out the possibility that we did not choose the time-points and conditions most similar to the in planta situation, or that the ones we did choose may not be more similar to earlier infection time-points rather than to  <dig> hours post-inoculation. further, we recognize that had different time-points been chosen for each treatment, we may have discovered additional gene expression patterns. however for the purposes of this study, we wished to examine what the fungus is likely faced with during invasive growth, a stage which remains a black box in m. oryzae pathology. our results lay the groundwork for formulating many testable hypotheses on how this fungus manages stressful environments.

out of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes,  <dig> and  <dig> were induced and repressed in all seven conditions, respectively. one of our most striking results was that most genes within the collection of  <dig> are enzymes with predicted roles in cell wall degradation and carbon metabolism . furthermore, fungal gene expression in rice and barley groups closely with fungal gene expression during carbon and nitrogen limiting conditions. together, these results suggest that m. oryzae at  <dig> hpi is nutrient deprived and may be degrading plant cell walls as a usable carbon source.

the induction of many cell wall degrading enzymes , observed in the present study, may also suggest that at  <dig> hpi m. oryzae is transitioning from the biotrophic to the necrotrophic phase of the disease cycle. destruction of plant cell walls likely leads to host cell death. the induction of several cwdes, such as pel , in the mm-n condition is not well understood and further studies are required to elucidate their role during nitrogen limitation. necrotrophic pathogens produce many cwde including pels. several cwdes were shown to be involved in pathogenesis. for example, a double disruption of two of the four pectate lyases  present in the pea hemibiotroph pathogen nectria haematococca genome rendered mutants drastically reduced in virulence  <cit> , but single gene knockouts did not affect virulence. such findings suggest that in highly redundant gene families, such as pels, there is a need for creating multiple combined knockouts.

most genes known to play a role in pathogenicity in the rice blast fungus are involved in pre-penetration or penetration stages. therefore, we did not expect to encounter many known pathogenicity genes in our in planta dataset for rice and barley. however, several genes that are known to play a role in either invasive growth, or in multiple stages of the disease cycle, were detected in our microarray studies. such genes included mpg <dig>  and cutinase cut <dig> . the hydrophobin mpg <dig> gene , which was first identified in cdna libraries from invasive growth of m. oryzae and shown to be induced during in planta growth as well as under in vitro carbon and nitrogen limitation conditions  <cit> , was also induced in our experiments in r, b, mm-c, and mm-n conditions. from previous studies, the cut <dig> gene was shown to be highly induced during appressorium maturation and penetration in m. oryzae and the cut <dig> mutant showed a reduced pathogenicity phenotype  compared to wild type,  <cit> . it was also highly induced at  <dig> hpi in that same study. the strong induction of this gene in the present study at  <dig> hpi suggests it might play a role during in planta invasive hyphal growth and during conidiophore emergence through the cuticle, as previously proposed by sweigard and colleagues  <cit> . however, further investigation is required to elucidate its role during the invasive infection stage in the host plant.

additionally, induction of the biotrophy-associated secreted  genes identified by mosquera and colleagues  <cit>  at  <dig> hpi supports our findings. three out of the four bas genes  were among the genes only induced during in planta infection of rice and barley. we found it notable that of the pathogenicity genes examined, cut <dig>  mas <dig>  aci <dig> and moflp <dig> were more strongly expressed in barley than in rice . had all the pathogenicity genes had a higher fold change in barley than rice, we might have attributed it simply to increased fungal biomass; the m. oryzae strain we used appears to colonize barley roughly 8- <dig> hours faster than rice. however, since only four of the ten genes examined had this molecular phenotype, we hypothesize that they must be more necessary in barley than rice for invasive growth. we are currently testing this hypothesis with the mas <dig> gene by deleting it from two strains, one that only infects barley and another that infects both rice and barley. the moflp <dig> gene is a member of the fasciclin family and predicted to be involved in cell adhesion; null mutants in this gene render the fungus less adhesive and less pathogenic  <cit> . it is difficult to speculate why this transcript is about 10-fold higher in barley versus rice, except that perhaps the cell wall and/or wax structure of barley leaves may differ enough from rice, such that more of this gene product needs to be produced in order to attach sufficiently to barley. likewise, the cut <dig> gene shows about a 17-fold increase while infecting barley, versus rice. this was a surprising result, considering we expect cutinase to be expressed more strongly during initial penetration events, rather than later in infection. one possibility is that because m. oryzae tends to infect barley more rapidly than rice, by  <dig> hpi it might need to be producing copious amounts of cutinase to forge its way out through the plant's cuticle. the cutinase family has been previously examined in m. oryzae, and consists of  <dig> members  <cit> . cut <dig> showed strongest expression during penetration, about  <dig> hpi and dropped off by  <dig> hpi, however in their transcriptional profiling of  <dig> of the  <dig> members, the authors did not go further than  <dig> hpi. we did examine the expression of one cutinase family member  across a time-course of infection in barley, and found that this gene started off strongest at  <dig> hpi, and fell sharply by  <dig> hpi. interestingly, skamnioti and colleagues  considered this gene to be "constitutively expressed", showing induction at some pre-penetration and penetration time-points, but then falling off by  <dig> hpi, which is in accordance with our result. taken together, our data and previously published data on the cutinase family members indicate that individual genes play different roles at different times during infection; localization experiments during infection time-courses would certainly help to elucidate when they are required.

our barley infection time-course also provided insight into a relatively unknown gene in m. oryzae, the mas <dig>  gene. this seven member family of proteins in m. oryzae has been studied with respect to their role in appressorial formation, and two members have been deleted from a related strain to 70- <dig>  guy <dig>  <cit> . these two members played a role in pathogenicity, but the gene studied here, mas <dig>  has not yet been looked at with regard to either of these important disease cycle stages. oh and colleagues  <cit>  noted that mas <dig> was down-regulated during appressorial development, while another member of the family, mgg_ <dig> , was strongly up-regulated. conversely, we have discovered that mas <dig> is highly up-regulated during invasive growth, while mgg_ <dig>  is strongly down-regulated. here, we find another case of individual family members playing roles at specific times during the infection cycle.

in the present study, we observed a high affinity amino acid permease agp <dig>  and an amino acid permease gap <dig>  among the differentially expressed genes. agp <dig>  was highly expressed in rice, barley, mm-c, and mm-n. higher fold changes were observed in rice and barley , compared with  <dig>  and  <dig>  in mm-c and mm-n, respectively. on the other hand, the rice blast gap <dig> gene showed repression in rice and barley , and a moderated induction in mm-c and mm-n . in s. cerevisiae, agp <dig> was shown to be highly involved in amino acid uptake in poor nitrogen conditions and its expression level was increased in the absence of gap <dig> <cit> . thus, the observation that agp <dig> is highly expressed whereas gap <dig> is down-regulated is similar to that observed by schreve and garrets  <cit> , and allows us to speculate that agp <dig> has to compensate the absence of gap <dig> when it is repressed, but when it is moderately induced, agp <dig> is also moderately induced. further studies are necessary to verify whether the co-regulation of such genes occurs and its significance to fungal invasive growth.

the oxidative stress induces the production of aflatoxin b <dig> and its precursors, such as norsolorinic acid as it has been demonstrated in a. parasiticus  <cit> . a norsolorinic acid reductase homologue  and two other putative aflatoxin precursor homologues were also present in our differentially expressed dataset, which are a sterigmatocystin 8-o-methyltransferase precursor  and a versicolorin reductase . however, blast analysis showed that mgg_ <dig>  is highly conserved in fungi  including those that are not known to produce aflatoxin, suggesting it might have other functions. interestingly, a nadp-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase  was highly induced in rice, barley, ts, pq, and mm. this enzyme has been suggested to be involved in oxidative protection in several plant fungi but the exact mechanism of protection has not yet been determined  <cit> .

abc transporters are known to play a role in fungal cells by diminishing toxic compounds produced by the plant cells. one m. oryzae abc transporter, named abc <dig> , has been characterized and deletion mutants showed a decrease in growth and died shortly after penetration of either rice or barley epidermal cells  <cit> . in our specific expression dataset, the abc transporter  was significantly repressed in r and in all stress treatments, which suggests that this gene might be involved in other stages of infection of m. oryzae. we also speculate that the function of this gene might be carried out more efficiently by other members of this large gene family.

with the expression data we have collected from several environmental conditions, we are in a position to begin to identify interaction networks. to investigate possible interactions we selected two genes that were induced under all seven conditions when compared to the reference sample. we then used these genes to perform a network analysis with the commercially available software ipa .

our selected genes for network analysis were an aldehyde dehydrogenase  and a glutathione s-transferase , both of which showed increased expression in all seven conditions. along with their expression profiles, they were chosen because of previous work that showed induction during interactions between the fungal apoplastic pathogen cladosporium fulvum and tomato , and their role in detoxification of reactive oxygen species , respectively  <cit> . coleman and colleagues  <cit>  reported an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene being induced during in planta growth and in vitro carbon and nitrogen starvation in c. fulvum, a non-obligate biotroph pathogen found on tomato. they suggested that starvation is likely one of the environmental signals for the expression of genes required for fungal growth in plant hosts. these genes have homologues in s. cerevisiae, and were used to create a network and the interacting molecules are shown . based on the interaction networks found in ipa, the aldh and the gst directly regulate a sugar transporter . the superoxide dismutases and a catalase indirectly inhibit gst, whereas gst directly and indirectly regulates several mitogen-activated protein kinases , which are involved in signal transduction pathways. dna methyltransferase  and histone methyltransferase and deacetylase  directly regulate the gst. expression data from genes in this interaction pathway are shown in table  <dig> 

while it is difficult to speculate how gsts and aldehyde dehydrogenase might regulate sugar transporters, it is well-known that gsts interact with both sods and catalases to detoxify reactive oxygen species  <cit> . furthermore, given gsts' role in detoxification, it might be reasonable to speculate that they trigger signalling pathways, such as those governed by map kinases. further experiments are needed to elucidate whether and how such genes are co-regulated and what kind of relationship indeed occurs in the rice blast fungus during invasive growth and stress conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated a robust dataset which advances our knowledge of the genes involved in stress response and invasive growth of the rice blast pathogen m. oryzae. invasive growth at  <dig> hpi appears to require genes involved in nutrient acquisition, which is in support of our original hypothesis, and in keeping with previous findings. future studies aimed at the functional characterization of genes reported here via targeted deletions or further real-time qrt-pcr experiments will help to better define pathways involved in m. oryzae invasive growth as well as their importance in earlier and later stages of disease. further, we demonstrated the utility of our dataset for formulating hypotheses for future research, when paired with literature searches and gene network analysis programs, such as ipa.
