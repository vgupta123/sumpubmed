BACKGROUND
the blood-feeding habit evolved independently in many arthropod orders or even within insect families  <cit> . although most orders containing hematophagous insects already existed in the carboniferous period, fleas probably arose in the early cretaceous, about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , but are thought to have expanded relatively recently, in the past  <dig> million years, where they spread simultaneously with mammals and birds  <cit> . for comparison, the culicidae provided a common ancestor for anopheline and culicine mosquitoes over  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , or  <dig> million years before the spread of fleas.

in their peculiar adaptation to blood feeding, arthropods had to prevent hemostasis and inflammatory mechanisms in the host, because these could disrupt the flow of blood or alert the host defense behavior. therefore, arthropods evolved a salivary cocktail that prevents blood clotting and platelet aggregation, induces vasodilatation, and additionally modulates the immune and inflammatory responses. a large diversity of salivary pharmacologically active molecules is produced by both unrelated and related hematophagous insects. for example, in the hemiptera, the salivary vasodilatation induced by the bed bug cimex lectularius and kissing bug rhodnius prolixus are both a result of nitric oxide, but they are carried out by completely different no-carrying molecules; a lipocalin in the case of rhodnius  <cit> , and a modified inositol phosphatase in the case of cimex  <cit> . in diptera, the salivary anticlotting mechanisms also differ between anophelines and culicines, where a unique antithrombin molecule named anophelin is found in the anopheles  <cit> , and a serpin inhibitor of factor xa occurs in aedes aegypti  <cit> . the enzyme apyrase  is ubiquitously found in the saliva of bloodsucking arthropods, where it destroys the inducer of platelet aggregation, adp and the proinflammatory mediator atp, released by damaged cells  <cit> ; however, two very different protein families have been recruited to serve this function in insect saliva. in mosquitoes  <cit>  and kissing bugs  <cit> , 5' nucleotidase family members serve this function, while calcium-dependent cimex apyrase family members are found in the bed bug  <cit>  and sand flies  <cit> . it is clear that a convergent evolutionary scenario accounts for the diversity of pharmacologically active salivary components of hematophagous insects, generating a large diversity of novel compounds.

four species of fleas are known to have salivary apyrase activity, but their enzymatic protein family is unknown  <cit> , while xenopsylla cheopis  and xenopsylla astia were shown to have salivary anticlotting activity  <cit> . hydrolysis of the lipidic agonist platelet activating factor  was also reported for the cat flea, but its molecular nature is unknown  <cit> . other studies on flea saliva emphasize its allergenic role in human and veterinary medicine  <cit> , including the molecular characterization of several antigens  <cit> . the paucity of salivary molecular information in fleas is indicated by the presence of only five proteins deposited in genbank belonging to siphonaptera and having the keyword 'salivary' , all belonging to the cat flea ctenocephalides felis.

despite great progress in the last  <dig> years in the identification of salivary pharmacologically active compounds, recent salivary transcriptome analysis of different bloodsucking arthropods is revealing a large number of putative secreted polypeptides for which the modes of action are unknown, including many novel protein families, some of which appear to be genus specific  <cit> . in the mosquitoes anopheles gambiae and ae.aegypti, over  <dig> salivary proteins have been identified; however, the function of fewer than  <dig> of these has been identified  <cit> . given the phylogenetic distance between fleas and other bloodsucking arthropods, this work attempts to fill a gap in the knowledge of the salivary repertoire of hematophagous animals by providing insight into the sialome of the human vector of plague, x.cheopis. in this work, several transcripts coding for novel protein and peptide families are described and their translation into polypeptides confirmed. this work expands our knowledge in the salivary diversity of bloodsucking animals and, at the same time, it increases and maps our ignorance on the potential pharmacologic role of these novel protein families. to the extent that immune responses to flea saliva can control plague or rickettsial diseases for which fleas are vectors–as is the case of some other arthropodborne diseases  <cit> –this study also provides a platform of potential candidate antigens for future studies.

RESULTS
cdna library characteristics
a total of  <dig> clones were sequenced and used to assemble a database  that yielded  <dig> clusters of related sequences,  <dig> of which contained only one expressed sequence tag . the consensus sequence of each cluster is named either a contig  or a singleton . for simplicity sake, this paper uses 'cluster' to denote sequences deriving both from consensus sequences and from singletons. the  <dig> clusters were compared using the program blastx, blastn, or rpsblast  <cit>  to the nonredundant protein database of the national center of biological information , to a gene ontology database  <cit> , to the conserved domains database of the ncbi  <cit> , and to a customprepared subset of the ncbi nucleotide database containing either mitochondrial or rrna sequences.

because the libraries used are unidirectional, the three-frame translations of the dataset were also derived, and open reading frames  starting with a methionine and longer than  <dig> amino acid  residues were submitted to signalp server  <cit>  to help identify putative secreted proteins. the est assembly, blast, and signal peptide results were loaded into an excel spreadsheet for manual annotation.

four categories of expressed genes derived from the manual annotation of the contigs . the putatively secreted  category contained 34% of the clusters and 75% of the sequences, with an average number of  <dig>  sequences per cluster. the housekeeping  category had 43% and 17% of the clusters and sequences, respectively, and an average of  <dig>  sequences per cluster. twenty two percent of the clusters, containing  <dig> % of all sequences, were classified as unknown , because no functional assignment could be made. similar to the hgroup, this category also had an average of  <dig>  sequences per cluster. a good proportion of these transcripts could derive from 3/ or 5/ untranslated regions of genes of the above two categories, as was recently indicated for a sialotranscriptome of an.gambiae  <cit> . a possible transposable element originated  <dig> singletons representing either active transposition or, more likely, expression of transposable element regulatory transcripts in x.cheopis.

housekeeping  genes
the  <dig> clusters  attributed to hgenes expressed in the salivary glands of x. cheopis were further characterized into  <dig> subgroups according to function . not surprisingly for an organ specialized in secreting polypeptides, the two larger sets were associated with protein synthesis machinery  and energy metabolism , a pattern also observed in other sialotranscriptomes  <cit> . we have also included in the h category a group of  <dig> est that grouped into eight clusters, representing conserved proteins of unknown function, presumably associated with cellular metabolism. the fourth most abundant group, attributed to the protein modification function, is of interest due to the specialized function of the salivary glands. this group, comprising five clusters, includes a chaperone protein and enzymes that are associated with disulfide bridge formation. several transporters were also identified, including those coding for two subunits of the vatpase complex, which has been shown to be necessary for mosquito salivation  <cit> . transcripts coding for vatpases are a common finding in mosquito sialomes  <cit> . the complete list of all  <dig> gene clusters, along with further information about each, is given in additional file  <dig> 

possibly secreted  class of expressed genes
inspection of additional file  <dig> indicates the expression of several expanded gene families, including a family encoding proteins producing a match to kog <dig>  indicative of lysosomal and prostatic acid phosphatases. this family alone is responsible for  <dig> clusters comprised of  <dig> sequences, or over 25% of the salivary library. mucins are also represented, as well as an expansion of a peptide family unique to fleas that is related to the cat flea antigen annotated as fsh precursor . several other novel peptide families, described in greater detail below, were also observed.

preliminary characterisation of the salivary proteome of x. cheopis
to obtain information on protein expression in the salivary glands of x. cheopis, salivary gland homogenates  of approximately  <dig> pairs of glands were separated by sds-page. the stained protein bands were excised from the gel and submitted to tryptic digestion followed by ms/ms identification. note that the electropherogram is dominated by two broad bands in the molecular mass range of 40– <dig> kda . only five slices of the gel shown in figure  <dig> yielded useful information by being assigned to predicted sequences from our clusterized database and to fulllength sequences disclosed in this work. these results are summarized in figure  <dig>  to explore the expression of lower molecular mass polypeptides that were not represented in the sds-page experiment, we filtered  <dig> μg of homogenized salivary glands through a 30-kda cutoff filter and submitted this filtrate to direct lc-ms/ms analysis. in addition, an aliquot of this filtrate was digested with trypsin prior to lc-ms/ms analysis. the low molecular weight  filtrate yielded  <dig> additional matches with secreted proteins, as indicated in the supplemental tables s <dig> and s <dig>  the description of the identified proteins are embedded in the following manuscript sections.

analysis of the adult female xenopsylla cheopis sialotranscriptome
several clusters of sequences coding for housekeeping and putative secreted polypeptides indicated in additional file  <dig> are abundant and complete enough to extract consensus sequences of novel sequences. additionally, we have performed primer extension studies in several clones to obtain full-or near full-length sequences of products of interest. a total of  <dig> novel sequences,  <dig> of which code for putative secreted proteins, are grouped together in additional file  <dig> 

following is a detailed description of the full-length transcripts found in the salivary glands of adult x. cheopis:

putative salivary secreted proteins for which a protein family is known
enzymes
phosphatase family
acid phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters and, in some cases, phosphoryl transfer between a phosphoester and alcohols  <cit> . these proteins are widely distributed in animal and plants, occurring in three different types. one type has a relatively small mw  and is found in mammalian liver, a second type has a higher mw , such as the enzymes of wheat germ, lysosomes and prostate. the third type are the purple acid phosphatases, which contain a binuclear iron center  <cit> . as listed in additional file  <dig>  eight full-length transcripts coding for mature proteins ranging from 36– <dig> kda all having a basic  pi were identified in this study. we also report two truncated  members of this family. all transcripts of this class produce similar matches to lysosomal/prostatic acid phosphatases in the nr and go databases, as well as to kog <dig> indicative of lysosomal and prostatic phosphatases. except for one of the truncated members, several peptides were identified for each protein originating from the major band at  <dig> kda reported in figure  <dig>  edman degradation of the same band also revealed a strong signal for the proteins annotated as phos, phos <dig> and phos 1a.

alignment of the flea salivary phosphatase sequences with the vertebrates human, rat and chicken members, as well as with the venom phosphatase of the bee, a fly  and a beetle  shows that, except for the first arginyl residue, all flea sequences do not have the conserved catalytic site residues as determined by crystal analysis of the human and rat sequences   <cit> . remarkably absent is the histidyl residue located in the conserved motif rhgdr found in all non-flea sequences. this residue is known to be essential for catalysis, forming a phosphorylated intermediate during the reaction. all these active site residues experimentally determined for vertebrate enzymes are conserved in the fly, beetle and bee enzymes, indicating that fleas probably co-opted the acid phosphatase fold for a non-phosphatase function. indeed, only a few other aa are conserved across the alignment shown in figure  <dig>  including the last three cysteines, a region of double aromatic aas, and another region of double glycines, among others. phylograms of the alignments show three distinct clades . clade i has all non-flea enzymes, where three sub-families are found, the vertebrate subfamily   <cit> , the bee venom enzyme , and the fly and beetle enzymes . clade ii has eight of the ten flea sequences , and contains the flea sequences with the most conservation to the non-flea members, while clade iii has the two most divergent flea sequences . the odd number of cysteines in all invertebrate sequences indicate the possibility of reactive sulfhydryl groups in all enzymes, including those vertebrate enzymes where two of the six cysteines are not involved in disulphide bridges. it is apparent that fleas achieved a unique expansion of acid phosphatases, at least nine members of which were identified in the salivary glands using ms/ms. in contrast, only three genes are found for this class of enzymes in the an. gambiae proteome  for the kog motif lysosomal and prostatic acid phosphatases), or four such enzymes in the human genome  <cit> .

the real substrate of acid prostatic/lysosomal phosphatases   <cit>  is not known, but it has been suggested that it can act as a protein tyrosine phosphate phosphatase and affect cell growth when the enzyme occurs intracellularly  <cit> . extracellular protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is known to affect many aspects of cellular signaling  <cit> , and is involved in platelet aggregation  <cit> . the conserved basic nature of all flea salivary phosphatases points to interaction with a negatively charged target. although the active center of acid phosphatases appear quite open, accepting a diversity of small substrates, it is possible that the large size of the enzyme confers some degree of selectivity to the larger phosphorylated protein substrates. this selectivity is analogous to the large serine proteases that are involved in vertebrate blood clotting or invertebrate prophenoloxidase activation, which accepts many different small substrates but are quite specific for their protein substrates. accordingly, it is possible that binding some host phosphorylated protein substrate has been the target of flea salivary phosphatases. perhaps loss of the enzymatic activity kept the substrate permanently blocked by an inactive interaction, resulting in a more advantageous complete receptor blockage. on the other hand, loss of enzymatic function would require larger amounts of the protein to interact stoichiometrically with the target host protein, which might have been the reason for large protein expression and gene duplication observed, where gene duplication immediately confers the benefit of increased transcription. with time, gene duplicates may diverge to different targets, and/or to avoid immune detection by hosts. it is also possible that this phosphatase family may have evolved to chelate polyphosphates released by platelets that recently have been shown to have important hemostatic functions  <cit> . these considerations should help to identify the function of the flea salivary phosphatases.

esterase
additional file  <dig> reports two mrna sequences coding for esterases, both similar to many insect proteins annotated as carboxylesterases. the xc- <dig> translation product of  <dig> aa is similar to the aminoterminal region of carboxylesterases with sizes varying between  <dig> and  <dig> aa  <cit> . the full polyadenylated transcript has clear polyadenylation sites and cannot transcribe for the larger homolog. unless the est is an artifact, it appears that flea saliva codes for a truncated version of a carboxylesterase enzyme. on the other hand, evidence for expression of the full-length esterase, consistent with a protein product of ~  <dig> kda, was obtained by the ms/ms experiments from gel slices  <dig> and  <dig> shown in figure  <dig>  another esterase is coded by cluster- <dig>  a truncated mrna coding for the carboxy terminus of a different carboxylesterase. because we did not obtain the 5' region of this mrna, we cannot verify whether the protein product has a signal peptide indicative of secretion. these mrna sequences are included in the putative secreted category due to the possibility these enzymes may function as paf hydrolases, as was found with an esterase salivary activity of the cat flea  <cit> . esterases have been also reported in the salivary glands and saliva of both male and female adult ae. aegypti mosquitoes  <cit> , but their natural substrate is unknown.

apyrase
five transcripts coding for a homolog of an apyrase member of the cd <dig> family is the first finding of this type of gene expressed in the salivary glands of any hematophagous arthropod to date . the consensus sequences shown in additional file  <dig> indicates the est are truncated and match the 3' region of homologous sequences, accounting for approximately 50% of the enzyme. this relatively abundant gene product may account for the salivary apyrase of this flea species. because this activity was never described in x. cheopis, we investigated whether its sgh could hydrolyze adenosine nucleotides. figure  <dig> indicates, as found for most salivary homogenates of bloodsucking arthropods, that x.cheopis has indeed a divalent cation dependent salivary apyrase activity, that can be activated by either ca++ or mg++. this result is consistent with a cd <dig> or a 5'-nucleotidase family member, who functions with either divalent cation, but is not consistent with the cimex apyrase type found in bed bugs and sand flies, which are strictly ca++ dependent. protocols involving rapid amplification of cdna ends  were used to obtain the 5' region of the truncated putative apyrase transcripts, yielding the full-length sequence coding for xc-apy, shown in additional file  <dig>  when xc-apy was compared with eight members of the human cd <dig> family, plus the soluble potato apyrase sequence, the four conserved regions of the enzyme family are clearly found  <cit>  . except for two human enzymes that are secreted, the remaining human sequences are membrane bound by two membrane anchors, one in each of the carboxy- or aminoterminal regions of the protein, indicated by the bars above the alignments in figure  <dig>  and by the predominance of aliphatic aa . these hydrophobic regions coincide with membrane helices predicted by the tmhmm server, and can be seen in additional file  <dig> <cit> . these carboxyterminal helices are missing in the two secreted human enzymes  <cit> , on the soluble potato apyrase, and in the flea apyrase . the flea apyrase also contains a clear signal peptide indicative of secretion, supporting the hypothesis that xc-apy is responsible for the salivary apyrase of x.cheopis. mass spectrometry experiments located this enzyme within bands  <dig> and  <dig> of the gel shown in figure  <dig>  consistent with a mw of 45- <dig> kda, and matching the predicted mass of the mature secreted enzyme of  <dig>  kda. to the extent that xc-apy is responsible for the observed salivary apyrase activity of x.cheopis, this will be the first description of a hematophagous arthropod to have co-opted this protein family for this particular activity.

adenosine deaminase
three transcripts code for truncated versions of the enzyme adenosine deaminase , for which both transcripts and enzymatic activity were demonstrated in mosquito and sand fly salivary glands  <cit> . this salivary activity may help to convert mast cell degranulating adenosine into inosine  <cit> .

mucins
three full-length transcripts with signal peptides indicative of secretion code for peptides of mature mw ranging from  <dig> – <dig> kda and having 6– <dig> putative galactosylation sites. they produce no similarity matches to any known proteins. two of these products appear to result from a gene duplication event. peptides with a high number of predicted galactosylation sites are regularly found in other hematophagous insect's sialotranscriptomes. these proteins may help to lubricate the insect food canal. evidence for translation of xc- <dig> was found in bands  <dig> and  <dig> in the gel experiment of figure  <dig>  and also in the low mw filtrate. expression of xc <dig> was indicated by a peptide match in the digested low mw filtrate.

antimicrobial peptide
the full-length sequence for an antimicrobial peptide  of the defensin family is presented in additional file  <dig>  antimicrobial peptides are a regular finding in sialotranscriptomes of hematophagous insects and ticks. these peptides, when ingested with the blood meal, help control bacterial growth in the gut and may also protect their host-feeding lesions from infection.

antigen  <dig> family
this protein family is widely found in the venom of vespids  <cit> , in the salivary glands of many blood-sucking insects  <cit> , and also as a multi-gene family in most animal genomes such as in drosophila  <cit> . these proteins belong to the larger family of cysteine-rich extracellular proteins  ubiquitously found in animals and plants  <cit> . most proteins have no known function. we here report a salivary member of the antigen  <dig> family found in x. cheopis. alignment and phylogenetic analysis of insect members of this family indicates, as expected, that x. cheopis salivary antigen  <dig> protein clusters with a related salivary protein from the cat flea .

putative salivary secreted proteins belonging to novel polypeptide families
fs or antigen <dig> family
the sialotranscriptome of x. cheopis revealed transcripts coding for several peptides with similarity to a previously described antigen of the cat flea named fs-h precursor, as well as two other cat flea larger proteins named fs-i and antigen  <dig> precursors. when the newly discovered peptide sequences were compared with the whole transcriptome database  other related sequences were found, thus creating a group of  <dig> related products that have in common solely the presence of eight cysteine residues , the presence of signal peptides indicative of secretion, and a mature molecular mass varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda.

the phylogram  shows two unrelated groups of sequences, with strong bootstrap support for the relationship among several sequence pairs, including one pair consisting of one cat flea and one rat flea sequence. however, the roots of the several clades have weak bootstrap support indicating that these sequences either originated from unrelated genes, or more likely, they originated from gene duplication events with fast divergence from the ancestral gene. the programs hmmbuild and hmmcalibrate of the hmmer package   <cit>  were used to make a hidden markov model from the alignment shown in figure 6a . the program hmmsearch from the same package was used to scan the ncbi nonredundant protein database with the flea sequences described here added. only flea sequences were retrieved at a significant probability level . two additional sequences were retrieved at much lower significance levels, one being also a flea sequence, and one plant peptide . when the plant peptide was compared with the nr database  several defensinlike molecules from arabidopsis and helianthus were retrieved.

plant and insect defensins as well as the scorpion toxins show a high degree of structural conservation despite considerable divergence of sequence  <cit> . these peptides adopt a cysteine-stabilized-αβ fold containing a three stranded β-sheet and a single α-helix  <cit> . the cysteine sequence motif c...cxxxc...gxc...cxc is conserved in this group, where x is any amino acid and ... is a variable interval of aa  <cit> . the six cysteine residues contained in the motif form three disulfide bonds, and a fourth disulfide bond is often present, but its position is variable. sequence alignments of fs family of flea salivary peptides with insect/plant defensins reveal only low overall identity. however, the three disulfide bond cysteine sequence motif characteristic of defensins and scorpion toxins is present , making it likely that these peptides belong to the cysteine stabilized αβ fold group. insect type defensins are antimicrobial molecules important for protection against bacteria and fungi  <cit> , while scorpion toxins are neurotoxic molecules that impair the functions of sodium and potassium channels  <cit> . based on this similarity, possible functions of this group of peptides could include, but not be limited to, controlling microbial growth or analgesic function.

the digested or undigested  <dig> kda filtered sgh provided for ms/ms identification of  <dig> of the  <dig> peptides reported in additional file  <dig>  while the front of the gel shown in figure  <dig> allowed for identification of two peptides, also identified by ms/ms of the filtrated sample .

other novel peptides
fifteen other polypeptides are described in additional file  <dig>  all containing a signal peptide indicative of secretion, and without significant matches to other proteins in the nr database, except for the peptide named cluster- <dig> that is weakly similar to low complexity bacterial proteins. two of these peptides appear to be splice variants  or products of recent gene duplication. two other peptides  share significant homology in their signal peptides, but not so much in their mature peptide sequences. except for cluster- <dig> that codes for a mature protein of  <dig>  kda, all other peptides have a predicted weight smaller than  <dig>  kda, six of which are less than five kda. xc- <dig>  coding for a mature peptide of  <dig>  kda has a weak smart match to calcitonin or calcitonin gene related peptides, the last one being a potent vasodilator  <cit> . xc- <dig> is weakly similar to hiv gp <dig> and to patented peptides with inhibitory activity towards the viral protein binding to the ccr <dig> receptor. cluster- <dig> peptide has a cysteine scaffold found in the cysteine rich region of tick salivary metalloproteases, suggestive of an interaction with extracellular matrix elements. xc- <dig> has sequence homology to patented decapeptides similar to peptide hormone receptors, and to small sequence regions of these receptors. xc- <dig> has the cysteine scaffold of arthropod defensins, including the c-x-c carboxyterminus where x is a hydrophobic aa . mass spectrometry experiments indicated in additional file  <dig> produced evidence for expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> polypeptides.

housekeeping proteins
additional file  <dig> describes  <dig> full-length sequences coding for  <dig> proteins involved in protein synthesis , two that are part of the proteasome machinery, one involved in protein modification, one cytoskeletal protein, one involved in energy metabolism and two that are uncharacterised, conserved proteins. these sequences can help in phylogenetic studies and as controls in future studies with x.cheopis.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the salivary transcriptome of the flea x. cheopis revealed the unique pathways taken in the evolution of the salivary cocktail of fleas. gene duplication events led to large expansions of a family of probably inactive acidic phosphatases, never found before in any other blood-sucking arthropod, and to the fs family of peptides unique to fleas. additionally, over a dozen unique peptides were found. an apyrase-coding transcript of the cd- <dig> family appears as the candidate for the salivary nucleotide hydrolyzing activity in x. cheopis. if this is confirmed, this will be the first arthropod to have recruited this gene family for its salivary apyrase activity. only five other flea salivary sequences exist at this time at ncbi, all from the cat flea c. felis. this work accordingly represents the only relatively extensive sialome description of any flea species. sialotranscriptomes of additional flea genera will reveal the extent that these novel polypeptide families are common throughout the siphonaptera.
