BACKGROUND
sweetpotato, ipomoea batatas  lam., is an important food crop widely grown in the world. more than  <dig> million tons are produced globally, 95% of which are grown in developing countries  <cit> . it is also an alternative source of bioenergy as a raw material for fuel production  <cit> . the orange-fleshed sweetpotato is rich in beta-carotene, which plays a crucial role in preventing vitamin a deficiency-related blindness and maternal mortality  <cit> . in addition, polyphenols in sweetpotato leaves are found to suppress the growth of human cancer cells  <cit> . sweetpotato is a highly heterozygous and self-incompatible autohexaploid  and little is known about its genome  <cit> .

recently, de novo whole-genome sequencing of the selfed line mx23hm and the highly heterozygous line 0431– <dig> of i. trifida  was performed using the illumina hiseq platform, but their assembly and annotation are still in the early stages  <cit> . transcriptome sequencing of sweetpotato provided an important transcriptional data source for studying storage root formation, flower development and carotenoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis of this species . lang et al.  <cit>  reported the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome of sweetpotato using the next-generation sequencing technology. however, the full genomic sequence of the cultivated sweetpotato is still absent.

bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries are valuable resources for genome sequencing, physical mapping, analysis of gene structure and function and comparative genomics, in particular for the species unsequenced or of complex genome structure . sequencing the ends of bac clones is an efficient strategy to produce low-pass genomic sequences, which are used to estimate genome properties such as genome organization and composition, to identify macro- and micro-synteny between species, to facilitate the assembly of contigs into scaffolds during whole genome sequencing and to develop molecular markers . bac-end sequences  analyses have been conducted in number of plant species such as rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , apple  <cit> , spartina maritima  <cit> , sugarcane  <cit> , coffee  <cit>  and passion fruit  <cit> . to date, the bac library of sweetpotato has not been constructed.

in the present study, the first bac library of sweetpotato was constructed. clones from the bac library were end-sequenced and analyzed to provide genome-wide information about sweetpotato. the analyses focused on gc content, repeat element composition, protein encoding regions, simple sequence repeat  and genome comparison between sweetpotato and other plants.

RESULTS
bac library construction and characterization
a sweetpotato bac library was constructed using sweetpotato line xu  <dig> with high dry-matter content and stem nematode resistance by partial digestion of its nuclear dna with hindiii. the bac library consisted of  <dig>  bac clones stored in  <dig>  microtitre plates, from which  <dig> clones were randomly selected to estimate the average insert size. the insert size ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, with an average size of  <dig> kb. the majority  of the clones had insert sizes of >  <dig> kb,  <dig> % between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb,  <dig> % <  <dig> kb and  <dig> % no insert . based on the sweetpotato genome size of 2200– <dig> mb  <cit> , the bac library had a  <dig> – <dig>  × coverage of the genome, and the probability of isolating any single-copy dna sequence from the library was more than 99%.fig.  <dig> insert size analysis of the sweetpotato bac library. a pulsed filed gel electrophoresis of  <dig> bac clones dna digested with not i . mi was midrange i pfg marker; mii was midrange ii pfg marker. the arrow shows the  <dig>  kb band of the cloning vector. b distribution of the insert size of  <dig> randomly selected sweetpotato bac clones




a subset of the library consisting of  <dig>  individual bac clones was screened using mitochondrial and chloroplast gene specific primers. the results indicated that the library had a very low frequency of clones derived from the mitochondrial genome  and chloroplast genome .

to check the utility of the library in gene isolation, the library was screened with special primers complementary to the sequences of two sweetpotato genes, ibppos  and ibmips <dig>  <cit> . it was found that  <dig> and  <dig> clones harbored ibppos and ibmips <dig>  respectively, showing the availability of the bac library for gene isolation.

bac-end sequences
a total of  <dig>  clones were sequenced from both forward and reverse directions and  <dig>  raw data reads were produced . after trimming bess for vector and low read quality sequences,  <dig>  bess with a quality score of ≥ <dig> and a sequence length ≥ <dig> bp were obtained. an additional set of  <dig> bess was filtered out due to high similarity to arabidopsis mitochondria  or chloroplast . the remaining  <dig>  bess, including  <dig>  paired-end reads and  <dig>  unpaired reads, represented about  <dig>  mb  of the sweetpotato genome and their lengths ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, with an average length of  <dig> bp. in terms of length distribution, 700– <dig> bp were the most abundant categories, accounting for  <dig> %  of all bess, followed by 600– <dig> bp  and 800– <dig> bp  . the gc content was  <dig> %, indicating that the sweetpotato genome is at-rich . all bess of length ≥ <dig> bp were deposited to the genbank gss database .table  <dig> summary of bac-end sequencing

repetitive dna content and composition
based on similarity searches in the repeat database,  <dig> %  of the nucleotides in the sweetpotato bess were identified as known repetitive dna elements . class i retrotransposons were the most abundant repeats, representing  <dig> % of the total repetitive dna content and  <dig> % of the total genomic sequence. they were subdivided into ltr retrotransposons and non-ltr retrotransposons. ltr retrotransposons, included ty1-copia elements and ty3-gypsy elements, accounted for  <dig> % of the total retrotransposons and  <dig> % of the genomic sequence. the number of ty3-gypsy  was slightly higher than that of ty1-copia . non-ltr retrotransposons, including short interspersed elements  and long interspersed elements , represented  <dig> % of the total retrotransposons and  <dig> % of the genomic sequence. the number of lines  exceeded that of sines . a total of  <dig> class ii dna transposons were predicted, representing  <dig> % of the total repetitive dna content and  <dig> % of the total genomic sequence. the hobo-activator was found to be the most elements , followed by cmc-enspm , mule-mudr  and rc/helitro . in addition, simple repeats, low complexity, small rna and satellite elements were also identified .table  <dig> classification and distribution of repetitive dna elements in bess




a total of  <dig> repeat families were detected by repeatmodeler and the lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. ten of them were eliminated due to containing hits to transposon related proteins. the remaining  <dig> families were not found in the public repeat database and considered as sweetpotato novel repetitive elements,  <dig> of which were classified as dna transposons,  <dig> as ltrs,  <dig> as lines,  <dig> as sines and  <dig> as unknown. these sweetpotato unique repeats were used as a custom library for repeatmasker and masked a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp, equivalent to  <dig> % of the total genomic sequence. together with the known repeats, the total repetitive dna content in sweetpotato genome was about  <dig> %.

protein coding regions and functional annotation
after masking the known and novel repeats, the remaining  <dig>  bess were used to identify protein coding regions. a total of  <dig>  bess were found to be homologous to the sweetpotato express sequence tags  downloaded from ncbi genbank and derived from our in-house transcriptome data , accounting for  <dig> %  of the total length of sweetpotato bess ;  <dig>  bess were of significant hits to ncbi-ests database, accounting for  <dig> %  of sweetpotato bess . taken together,  <dig>  bess were homologous to ests databases, with a cumulative match length of  <dig> , <dig> bp, representing  <dig> % of the total bess dataset . of these,  <dig>  bess were also of significant hits to ncbi nr database and the cumulative match length was  <dig>  bp, accounting for  <dig> % of the total bess dataset . the majority of the top-hits were to solanum lycopersicum , nicotiana sylvestris , n. tomentosiformis , vitis vinifera , s. tuberosum , coffea canephora  and theobroma cacao  .fig.  <dig> list of plant species that had significant hits to the sweetpotato bess




functional annotation showed that  <dig>  ontological terms were assigned to  <dig>  bess. these bess were further classified into three categories: cellular components , molecular functions  and biological processes  . of the bess in the cellular components category,  <dig>  were for cell part,  <dig>  for membrane-bounded organelle and  <dig>  for organelle part. the bess in molecular functions category were distributed as follows: organic cyclic compound binding , heterocyclic compound binding , ion binding , small molecule binding , transferase activity , carbohydrate derivative binding  and hydrolase activity . the most represented biological processes were metabolic process , hydrolase activity  and single-organism process .fig.  <dig> go classification of the predicted protein-coding genes from the sweetpotato bess. a cellular components. b molecular functions. c biological processes




a total of  <dig>  bess had significant matches to the protein database of s. lycopersicum, with a cumulative match length of  <dig>  bp, representing  <dig> % of the total bess dataset . based on an estimated sweetpotato genome size of 2200– <dig> mb, the total coding region length of the sweetpotato genome was predicted to  <dig> – <dig>  mb. if the average coding region length in sweetpotato was  <dig>  bp, as in s. lycopersicum, the total gene content of the sweetpotato genome might be  <dig> – <dig> . as compared to the v. vinifera protein database,  <dig>  bess showed significant matches, accounting for  <dig> %  of the total bess dataset . the total coding region length of sweetpotato was estimated as  <dig> – <dig>  mb and the number of genes was predicted as  <dig> – <dig> , assuming that an average coding region length was  <dig>  bp as in v. vinifera. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bess showed significant hits to the cds databases of mx23hm and 0431– <dig> of i. trifida , representing  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the total bess dataset, respectively . the coding regions in sweetpotato were estimated as  <dig> – <dig>  mb and  <dig> – <dig>  mb and the number of genes was predicted as  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig> , according to a gene cds length of  <dig>  bp in mx23hm and  <dig>  bp in 0431– <dig>  respectively.

simple sequence repeats 
the  <dig>  bess were subjected to a search for ssrs and a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified from  <dig>  bess. the average density of ssrs in sweetpotato bess was one ssr per  <dig>  kb. most of ssrs were mono- , di-  and trinucleotide repeats , with less abundant tetra- , penta-  and hexanucleotide repeats  . a/t motifs were the most common mononucleotide repeats, while g/c motifs were present at a much lower frequency . the most frequently occurring motifs were at/at in the dinucleotide repeats and aat/att in the trinucleotides repeats. thus, at-rich ssrs were consistently more abundant than gc-rich ssrs. of the  <dig>  ssrs,  <dig>  were perfect ssrs containing a single repeat motif, and  <dig> were compound ssrs composed of two or more ssrs separated by ≤  <dig> bp. the perfect ssrs were further subdivided into class i  and class ii  according to the method of temnykh et al.  <cit> . di-  and trinucleotide motifs  were of most abundance in class i ssrs, while mononucleotide motifs  were most frequently occurred in class ii ssrs.fig.  <dig> distribution of ssr motifs in the sweetpotato bess and ests




the distribution and frequency of different types of ssrs in sweetpotato bess were compared with those in the ests . a total of  <dig>  est-ssrs were identified from the sweetpotato ests  downloaded from ncbi genbank and derived from our in-house transcriptome data  using microsatellite . the mononucleotide repeats were the most abundant type , followed by di- , tri- , tetra- , penta-  and hexanucleotide repeats , showing a consistent trend with those in bes-ssrs. compared to bes-ssrs, the most common motifs were also a/t in mononucleotide est-ssrs, but the most frequently occurring motifs were ag/ct in the dinucleotide repeats and aag/ctt in the trinucleotides repeats . furthermore, the average density of ssrs in the ests was one ssr per  <dig>  kb, which was approximately a half of bess , indicating that potential ssrs are more numerous in bess than in ests.

for comparison purposes, analyses were performed to identify bes-ssrs of other species. a consistent trend was found that the proportion of the corresponding ssrs decreased as the length of motif unit increased in most of the surveyed species. mono-, di- and trinucleotide repeats were dominant in all of the surveyed species, accounting for more than 97% of the total ssrs . the at-rich ssrs frequently occurred in all of the surveyed species . in addition, sweetpotato showed a higher density of ssrs among the surveyed species .fig.  <dig> frequency of at-rich repeat motifs in bess of sweetpotato and other plant species




of the  <dig>  ssrs,  <dig> were chosen to design primers for assessing their allelic polymorphisms with  <dig> sweetpotato accessions . the  <dig> primer pairs  successfully amplified products from at least  <dig> of the  <dig> tested accessions and  <dig> primer pairs  produced polymorphic bands among the  <dig> tested accessions on denaturing polyacrylamide gels . furthermore, the  <dig> polymorphic primer pairs were assessed for their allelic polymorphisms with the  <dig> sweetpotato accessions and  <dig> of them  produced polymorphic bands on agarose gels . twelve of the  <dig> primer pairs were chosen to amplify  <dig> f <dig> individuals derived from a cross between xushu  <dig> and xu  <dig> and  <dig> of them generated polymorphic bands on agarose gels .

comparative genome analysis
the  <dig>  sweetpotato bess were compared to the genome sequences of mx23hm and 0431– <dig> of i. trifida . a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   bess had significant hits to the genome sequences of mx23hm and 0431– <dig>  respectively. the matches were scattered in  <dig>  contigs of mx23hm and  <dig>  contigs of 0431– <dig>  with a cumulative match length of  <dig> , <dig> bp  and  <dig> , <dig> bp , respectively. of these bess,  <dig> and  <dig> paired bess were aligned on the same contigs of mx23hm and 0431– <dig>  respectively, in the correct orientation within 15– <dig> kb apart . these results support that sweetpotato has a highly close relationship with i. trifida .

these bess were also compared to the sequenced s. lycopersicum, v. vinifera, t. cacao and a. thaliana genomes to identify microsyntenic regions. n. sylvestris, n. tomentosiformis, s. tuberosum and c. canephora genomes are still in the early stages of their assembly and annotation and are not suitable for comparative mapping studies  <cit>  though they had the high number of top hits to sweetpotato.

according to the method of rampant et al.  <cit> , the matches are classified into  <dig> categories: ‘single end’  and ‘paired end’ . the pe category is subdivided into ‘non-colocalized’ and ‘colocalized’ and the latter includes ‘collinear’, ‘rearranged’ and ‘gapped’. a total of  <dig> bess  were matched to the genome sequences of s. lycopersicum . twelve of the  <dig> pes were ‘non-colocalized’, and  <dig>  mapped to the s. lycopersicum chromosome  <dig> within ~ <dig> kb apart fell into the ‘collinear’ category, suggesting the presence of one putative microsyntenic region between sweetpotato and s. lycopersicum . r358h <dig> began at position  <dig> , <dig> bp and f358h <dig> terminated at position  <dig> , <dig> bp . this region contained  <dig> genes, seven on sense strand and eight on antisense strand . comparative mapping between sweetpotato and v. vinifera revealed  <dig> matches, including  <dig> ses,  <dig> ‘non-colocalized’ and  <dig> ‘collinear’ . r157e <dig> and f157e <dig> formed ‘collinear’ alignment on the v. vinifera chromosome  <dig> within ~ <dig> kb apart, the reverse end beginning at position  <dig> , <dig> bp and the forward end terminating at position  <dig> , <dig> bp. this region encompassed  <dig> genes,  <dig> on sense strand and  <dig> on antisense strand . in addition,  <dig> matches  to the t. cacao genome and  <dig> matches  to the a. thaliana genome were identified . in the perspective of the whole genome, the matches dispersed on all chromosomes of s. lycopersicum, v. vinifera, t. cacao and a. thaliana and  <dig> of them were found in all of the four genomes .fig.  <dig> comparative analysis of the sweetpotato bess with the genomes of four sequenced plant species. the out circle represents the haploid chromosomes of the four species: s. lycopersicum , v. vinifera , t. cacao  and a. thaliana ; the middle circle represents the matches of single bess with the four plant genomes; the inn circle represents matches of the paired bess with the four plant genomes. paired bess are linked to each other with links: ‘non-colocalized’ , ‘collinear’ , ‘rearranged’  and ‘gapped’

discussion
sweetpotato is a highly heterozygous autohexaploid and its genomic bac library has not been reported to date. in the present study, the bac library of sweetpotato was successfully constructed using the elite line xu  <dig> of this crop. the bac library consisted of  <dig>  clones, the majority  of which had insert sizes of >  <dig> kb, with an average insert size of  <dig> kb, similar to the results reports in several plant species such as sugar beet  <cit> , peanut  <cit> , narrow-leafed lupin  <cit>  and passion fruit  <cit> . thus, this library has a reasonably large average insert size. the bac library provided a  <dig> – <dig>  × coverage of the sweetpotato genome, with more than 99% probability of isolating any single-copy dna sequence from the library. the coverage of this library is greater than those of peanut  <cit>  and passion fruit  <cit> , and comparable to those of sugar beet  <cit>  and narrow-leafed lupin  <cit> . additionally, the present library was constructed from a partial digestion of genomic dna using only one restriction enzyme , which was also used to construct the libraries of sugar beet   <cit> , peanut   <cit> , narrow-leafed lupin   <cit>  and passion fruit   <cit> . this might lead to preferential cloning owing to the uneven distribution of restriction sites throughout the genome, which could be minimized by developing more clones for the library using one or two new restriction enzymes in the future  <cit> . this is the first large-insert bac library for sweetpotato and a valuable tool for future sequencing and genome studies.

the present study provides a first overview of the structure and composition of the sweetpotato genome through the analysis of  <dig>  high quality bess. the gc content of the sweetpotato genome was  <dig> %, comparable to the  <dig> % of the chloroplast genome of this species and the  <dig> – <dig> % of i. trifida   <cit> . therefore, these results suggest that the genomes of sweetpotato and its wild relatives are all at-rich.

repetitive dna, as a significant portion of most eukaryotic genomes, plays important roles during polyploidization and post-polyploidization changes  <cit> . the i. trifida  genome is estimated to be composed of  <dig> – <dig> % repeats  <cit> . repetitive sequences account for at least  <dig> % of the assembled potato genome  <cit>  and this proportion reaches approximately 80% in wheat  <cit> . the present results revealed that the repetitive dna in the sweetpotato genome was approximately  <dig> %, with  <dig> % homologous to known repeats and  <dig> % specific to sweetpotato. the proportion of repeats in sweetpotato might be underestimated, as reported in many plant species such as s. tuberosum, s. lycopersicum and s. maritime  <cit> .

it is known that transposable elements have important consequences on genome structure and functions  <cit> . the present study indicated that class i retrotransposons  were significantly predominant compared to class ii dna transposons  in the sweetpotato genome, as in other plant genomes  <cit> . further analysis revealed that the percentage of class i retrotransposons was much larger in sweetpotato than in i. trifida , but the proportion of class ii dna transposons in sweetpotato was comparable to that in i. trifida . ty1-copia and ty3-gypsy retrotransposons are two main types of ltrs, playing important roles in maintaining chromatin structures and centromere functions and regulating gene expression in the host genomes  <cit> . the ratio of ty3-gypsy:ty1-copia in sweetpotato was approximately  <dig> : <dig>  indicating that the contributions of ty3-gypsy and ty1-copia to the sweetpotato genome were approximately equal. this ratio is similar to those of passiflora edulis   <cit> , m. guttatus , prunus persica  and p. edulis , but lower than those of s. lycopersicum , s. tuberosum , v. vinifera  and a. thaliana   <cit> . in addition, the novel repetitive elements were found in the sweetpotato genome. they were classified as dna transposons, ltrs, lines, sines and unknown. these repeats should be further used to study genome structure and functions of sweetpotato.

the proportion of the sweetpotato bess with potential coding regions was moderate compared to the assessment of coding regions in many bes-based studies . the cumulative coding region length was  <dig>  bp, representing  <dig> % of the total sweetpotato bess length. based on matches to the protein databases of s. lycopersicum and v. vinifera, the total coding sequences of the sweetpotato genome were predicted to be  <dig> – <dig>  mb and the gene content was estimated as  <dig> – <dig> . thus, the gene content is much higher in sweetpotato than in diploid i. trifida   <cit> . the large gene content might be caused by highly heterozygosity and the polyploidy nature of sweetpotato  <cit> .

ssr markers are widely used for genome analysis and map comparison and consensus due to their abundance, functionality, high polymorphism and excellent reproducibility  <cit> . bess have been proven to be valuable sources of ssrs  <cit> . in our study, a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified from the  <dig>  sweetpotato bess. the average density of ssrs was one ssr per  <dig>  kb in sweetpotato, close to those in carica papaya , a. thaliana , amborella trichopoda  and citrus clementine , and higher than those in the other surveyed species . our results also showed that potential ssrs were more numerous in the sweetpotato bess than in the ests, as reported in walnut and coffee  <cit> . furthermore, the amplification results indicated that the  <dig> % of primer pairs designed from the chosen ssrs exhibited good polymorphism among  <dig> sweetpotato accessions with differences in yield, quality and diseases resistance , which was higher than  <dig> % of primer pairs from est-ssrs reported by wang et al.  <cit> . the present bes-ssrs also showed good polymorphism among  <dig> f <dig> individuals of xushu  <dig> × xu  <dig> . therefore, these bes-ssrs can be used to identify germplasm, assess genetic diversity, construct genetic linkage maps and develop molecular markers for agronomically important traits in sweetpotato.

cytogenetic and molecular genetic evidences indicate that i. trifida  is the most likely diploid ancestor of the hexaploid sweetpotato . in the present study,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the sweetpotato bess were matched to the genome sequences of mx23hm and 0431– <dig> of i. trifida , covering  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total bess length, respectively. these results provide the genomic evidence for the highly close relationship between sweetpotato and i. trifida . moreover, the bac clones, with both ends aligned on the same contigs of i. trifida  in the correct orientation within 15– <dig> kb apart, were also identified and might be used in comparative genomics study between sweetpotato and i. trifida. comparative mapping between both species can not be performed due to the fact that i. trifida genome is still in the early stages of its assembly and annotation  <cit> .

well-sequenced species with the highest number of top hits are commonly used as reference genomes for the bac-end analysis of target species . our study revealed that more sweetpotato bess were matched to s. lycopersicum than v. vinifera, t. cacao and a. thaliana . it is consistent with the fact that sweetpotato and s. lycopersicum, belonging to solanales, diverged from a common ancestor approximately 82– <dig> million years ago, while the divergence between sweetpotato and v. vinifera, t. cacao and a. thaliana is estimated to be approximately 123– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . more sweetpotato bess were matched to the genome of v. vinifera than those of t. cacao and a. thaliana, which might be because v. vinifera did not undergo recent genome duplication  <cit> . similarly, the limited number of sweetpotato bess matched to the a. thaliana genome might be because the a. thaliana genome suffered many gene losses since its two whole-genome duplications  <cit> . these findings provide an interesting starting point for comparative genomics and evolution studies of sweetpotato.

CONCLUSIONS
the first genomic bac library for sweetpotato has been successfully constructed. it has a highly redundant genome coverage , and contains large inserts  and a very low frequency of clones derived from the mitochondrial genome and chloroplast genome. the high quality bess provide first insights into sweetpotato genome composition, including gc content, transposable elements and protein coding regions, and have significant hits to the genome sequences of i. trifida and more matches to the whole-genome sequences of solanum lycopersicum. ssrs identified from the bess show good polymorphism in sweetpotato. these resources as a robust platform will be used in high-resolution mapping, gene cloning, assembly of genome sequences, comparative genomics and evolution for sweetpotato.
