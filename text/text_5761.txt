BACKGROUND
programmed cell death  <cit> , as well as cell proliferation and cell differentiation, has a crucial role in biological growth and development. there are two primary programmed cell death signaling pathways  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit>  and autophagy  <cit> , of which apoptosis has been researched more extensively. apoptosis is characterized by morphological changes and biochemical events such as cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation, phosphatidylserine extrusion, vacuolization, chromatin condensation, dna fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies that are ultimately engulfed by surrounding cells or macrophages  <cit> . cell death by autophagy involves cell degradation by internal lysozymes  <cit> . there are very important connections between apoptotic cell death and autophagic cell death, as they occur concurrently in many processes  <cit> .

apoptotic mechanisms are being clarified in model organisms using completed genome sequences, especially in nematodes, fruit flies and humans. compared to drosophila and humans, the apoptosis network in nematodes is much simpler  <cit> . there are several differences in apoptotic mechanisms between mammals and nematodes. in mammals, two primary apoptotic signaling pathways have been described: the extrinsic pathway, which is initiated by the tumor necrosis factor /nerve growth factor  receptors superfamily  <cit> , and the intrinsic pathway, which include the mitochondrial pathway, the endoplasmic reticulum pathway and the dna damage pathway  <cit> . the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are connected by caspase-mediated activation of the pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family member bid and the c-jun n-terminal kinases , which converge on effector caspase activation  <cit> . most insect apoptosis research has used drosophila. there are some fundamental differences in apoptotic signaling pathways between drosophila and mammals. for example, the absence of rhg  family proteins virtually blocks apoptosis  <cit> . although smac/dablo and htra2/omi are functional homologs of the rhg family, their apoptotic roles are not as critical in vertebrates as rhg is in drosophila  <cit> . furthermore, cytochrome-c is dispensable for caspase activation  <cit>  and it is unclear whether mitochondria participate in apoptosis  <cit>  in drosophila. kumarswamya and colleagues  <cit>  recently used sf <dig> cells to demonstrate that cyosolic cytochrome-c release is an essential event for caspase activation during lepidopteran apoptosis, and that cytochrome-c release might occur independent of mitochondrial membrane potential loss and permeability transition pore formation. furthermore, cytochrome-c has been detected by western blot in the cytoplasm of uv-induced apoptotic silkworm cells, bme-swu <dig>  <cit> . these all are distinctively different from the mechanisms reported in drosophila, but are similar to mammalian apoptosis.

the domestic silkworm bombyx mori  has important economic value. investigation into apoptosis in lepidotera began at the same time as drosophila  <cit> . since intersegmental muscle apoptosis was studied in  <dig>  <cit> , apoptosis research in silkworm has lagged far behind that of other organisms until the 1990s. now, apoptosis research in silkworms mainly focus on two aspects. first, the morphological changes in tissues and cells during apoptosis-induced by extrinsic factors  and intrinsic factors , the individual organs  in bombyx mori apoptotic mutants  <cit>  and tissues  during metamorphosis  <cit> . the second aspect is gene cloning and identification. tambunan  <cit>  found that bmp <dig> in bombyx mori contains the four conserved bcl- <dig> homology  regions, bh <dig>  bh <dig>  bh <dig>  and bh <dig>  huang and colleagues  <cit>  have cloned the iap  homolog bmiap from bombyx mori bmn cells, and found that bmiap inhibits apoptosis induced by bax, but not fas, in mammalian cells. their biochemical data also suggested that bmiap is a specific inhibitor of mammalian caspase- <dig>  but not the downstream effectors caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  in the same year, kim and colleagues  <cit>  reported that the  <dig> k protein from silkworm hemolymph inhibits virus- or chemical-induced apoptosis in human cells as well as insect cells, although the mechanism remains unknown. the first caspase family member identified was bmcaspase- <dig> in bmn cells  <cit> . subsequently, the caspase family members bmice  <cit> , bmice- <dig> and bmice- <dig>  <cit>  were cloned from bombyx mori midgut and bme cells. recently, bryant and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated both drosophila dmreaper and its bombyx mori ortholog bmreaper possessed conservative iap binding and gh <dig>  motifs. the bombyx mori homologs bmpkc  <cit> , bmicad  <cit> , and bmcdc <dig>  <cit>  also have been cloned. however, how these genes participate in apoptosis in the silkworm is still unclear, and this area of research has been very fragmented.

apoptotic mechanisms in model organisms  can not accurately reflect the apoptotic mechanisms in silkworm. for these reasons, comprehensive and in-depth apoptosis research in bombyx mori is urgent. fortunately, the completion of the silkworm genome sequence  <cit>  and a whole-genome chip  <cit>  provide important tools for apoptosis research in bombyx mori. herein we looked for possible apoptosis-related homologs using information analysis in 9Ã— genome sequencing data. genes of interest were cloned and verified using cdna templates isolated from the bme cell line and different developmental stages of bombyx mori. finally, the potential apoptotic pathways in which these genes may act in bombyx mori were analyzed.

RESULTS
identification of silkworm apoptosis-related genes
we have identified  <dig> apoptosis-related genes, including five members of the caspase family . we have also identified one member of the bcl- <dig> family, two members of the tnf superfamily , and four members of the baculovirus iap repeat  domain family in bombyx mori . seventeen genes  have been previously included in ncbi, among which ten genes have been reported in bombyx mori including bmcaspase- <dig>  <cit> , bmice  <cit> , bmcdc <dig>  <cit> , bmerk  <cit> , bmicad  <cit> , bmiap  <cit> , bmjnk  <cit> , bmpkc  <cit> , bmreaper  <cit> , bmcyt c  <cit> , bmice- <dig> and bmice- <dig>  <cit>  . thirty five apoptosis genes were identified  and accepted by the ncbi . these silkworm apoptosis-related genes are located on most of the  <dig> chromosomes, except the chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the number of exons in the genes varied from one to dozens. the comparing key apoptosis-related gene numbers in various species  shows that there are fewer homologous genes in insects than in the higher eukaryotes. many important genes in apoptosis pathways were cloned and identified, such as bmapaf- <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmhtra <dig>  and bmendo g . however, we did not find homolog hits for many genes in our silkworm databases, including almost all genes of the bcl- <dig> and tnfsf families, and caspase-6/- <dig>  hid, grim, and sickle of the rhg family . detailed analysis of primary families and genes involved in apoptotic pathways follows.

the complete and incomplete est sequences are represented by  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. no domains are displayed when the bmacinus is blasted with the database in ncbi, but the first sequence in the result is submitted by the partner of the silkworm institutes in zhen jiang.

in this study homo sapiens represents mammals, drosophila melanogaster represents fruit flies, caenorhabditis elegans represents nematodes, strongylocentrotus purpuratus represents echinoids, bombyx mori represents silkworms, and danio rerio represents fish. the tnf family comprised of the ligands and the correspondent receptor. aa data are from  <cit> ; ab data are from  <cit> ; bb, cb, bc and cc data are from  <cit>  and  <cit> ; da-dd and fa-fc data are from  <cit>  and  <cit> , respectively. the other data are the results of blast searches with the database in ncbi.

caspase family members in silkworm
caspase are a family of cysteinyl aspartate proteinases with two main branches: the pro-inflammatory ice-like subfamily, previously found only in vertebrates  <cit> , and the apoptotic caspase subfamily. all caspases, normally present as inactive proenzymes in cells, have three different regions: n-terminal prodomains, a large catalytic domain  and a small catalytic domain . based on the length of the prodomain, caspases are divided into two groups: class i , which have a relatively long prodomain, and class ii , which have a short prodomain . based on the n-terminal prodomain, the initiators can be divided further into two categories: one class containing a caspase recruitment domain , such as caspase- <dig> and - <dig> in mammals and dronc in fruit flies, and the other possessing a death effector domain , such as caspase- <dig> and - <dig> in mammals. the mammalian caspase- <dig> is replaced functionally by the drosophila homologue dmdredd, while dmdredd does not have a ded in its n-terminal prodomain  <cit>  .

five caspase family homologs were cloned from the silkworm, including  <dig> initiators , and  <dig> effectors . the phylogenetic tree of caspase family members in silkworm and other species showed that all the intiator and effector homologs are clustered into group i and group ii, respectively. the initiator caspases containing ded domain are clustered into group i, while others containing card domain and dmdecay into the other subgroup . the results reveal that the caspase family members are functionally conserved between species.

silkworm initiator caspase homologs bmdronc and bmdredd
caspase- <dig> has a crucial role during apoptosis from nematodes to mammals. recently, dronc  homologs have been identified in the genomes of aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae   <cit> . the mammalian caspase- <dig> homolog bmdronc was identified in silkworm, which has two splice variants with common translation initiation and termination sites, named bmdroncl  and bmdroncs  respectively, and verified by cloning from silkworm bme cells . only bmdroncs has a card domain and a small subunit, while bmdroncl has the typical caspase family domains . the sequence identities of silkworm bmdroncl with homologs from homo sapiens, drosophila melanogaster, and aedes aegypti are 24%, 29% and 35%, respectively.

an ortholog of drosophila dredd was also found in the silkworm, named bmdredd , consistent with the data submitted to ncbi . the result of domain prediction revealed that bmdredd, aedredd and dmdredd have long prodomains but no domains that mark them as initiator caspases , unlike mammalian caspase- <dig> with deds. the genetic relationship between caspases from silkworm, aedes aegypti and drosophila is much closer than with other species . the sequence identities and similarities of bmdredd with dmdredd and aedredd are 28% and 45%, 27% and 45%, respectively.

silkworm effector caspases
bmcaspase- <dig> is the first effector caspase reported in bombyx mori. pei and colleagues  <cit>  identified bmcaspase- <dig>  from bombyx mori bmn cells. bmcaspase- <dig> has only one exon, is  <dig> bp long, coding for 293aa, and is located on chromosome  <dig> . bmcaspase- <dig> has the classic short prodomain, with the characteristic qacxg sequence in the large subunit  and the small subunit . from the evolutionary relationship, bmcaspase- <dig> clusters into the same group with dmice and dmdcp- <dig> of drosophila melanoganster . duan and colleagues  <cit>  identified bmice  from the bombyx mori integumentum, and song and colleagues  <cit>  have cloned bmice- <dig>  and bmice- <dig>  according to the sequence submitted by duan  <cit>  from bme cells. all these genes have the characteristic qrcag sequence and the typical large/small subunit configuration of caspase family members . we aligned and analyzed the sequences of these three coding sequences with the silkworm 9Ã— genome database, and the result reveals that bmice, bmice- <dig> and bmice- <dig> have the same translation and termination sites . bmice has seven exons, bmice- <dig> has eight exons and bmice- <dig> has nine exons; the splicing differences occur after the seventh exon .

our results demonstrated that there is an additional caspase family member in bombyx mori. because it has not been reported in bombyx mori previously, we named it bmcaspase-new . bmcaspase-n is  <dig> bp long, coding for  <dig> aa, and possesses the characteristic structure of caspase effector subfamily members, including a short prodomain and casc domain with the qacxg sequence. phylogenetic analysis revealed that bmcaspase-n clusters into the effector group . thus we propose that bmcaspase-n belongs to the effector caspase subfamily.

bcl- <dig> family members in silkworms
bcl- <dig> family members participate at a crucial point in apoptotic pathways. all members share at least one of four bh domains . tambunan and colleagues  <cit>  identified bmp <dig> from samples obtained during silk gland histolysis, a stage of bombyx mori metamorphosis. however, the function of bmp <dig> with all four conserved bh regions has not been confirmed in bombyx mori.

we analyzed and cloned the other bcl- <dig> family homolog bmbuffy, whose structure is more similar to buffy of apis mellifera and bcl- <dig> of pediculus humanus corporis . bmbuffy lacks the bh <dig> domain. the completed bmbuffy cdna is  <dig> bp, coding for  <dig> aa, and the relative predicted molecular mass is  <dig>  kda. the sequence similarity and identity are 51% and 27%, respectively, compared with dmbuffy.

bir domain family members in silkworms
the bir domain is a unique structure originally identified in iap proteins from baculoviruses. at least one bir motif is essential for the antiapoptotic activity of iap family members, but not all bir-containing proteins  are iaps  <cit> . we identified four proteins containing bir domains in bombyx mori, including two iaps, one bruce and one survivin. huang and colleagues  <cit>  cloned the first iap family member bmiap from bombyx mori bmn cells. bmiap is a specific inhibitor of mammalian caspase- <dig>  but does not directly inhibit the downstream effector proteases caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  bmiap inhibits apoptosis induced by bax but not fas in vitro. however, the function of bmiap in vivo is not yet known. the other iap family member bmiap <dig> is located on the same chromosome as bmiap, is  <dig> aa long and possesses three bir domains and one zn2+-finger domain. compared with diap <dig> and diap <dig>  bmiap <dig> and bmiap <dig> have two and three bir domains, respectively, also . the bmbruce and survivin proteins each have one bir domain, with a sequence consistent with the online bir sequence , and are  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa long, respectively . besides their size difference, bmbruce also has an ubiquitin-proteasome binding motif, which is homologous to drosophila bruce protein  <cit> .

rhg family members in drosophila contain the iap-binding-motif  domain in their n-terminal, which binds to and removes the inhibitory activity of iap  <cit>  as well as their structural and functional homologs smac/diablo in mammals  <cit> . however, rhg family proteins connect many different signaling pathways, thereby having a central role in the regulation of programmed cell death in drosophila, which is very different from other species, especially compared to mammalian smac/diablo <cit> . another iap inhibitor, htra2/omi in mammals and its homolog protein dmhtra/omi in drosophila, have a function similar to smac/diablo. dmhtra2/omi in drosophila also has serine protease activity. interestingly, reducing dmomi expression by rnai in the fly inhibits stress-induced apoptosis, while the neurodegeneration is increased in the htra2/omi knockout mouse  <cit> . the homolog bmreaper, an ortholog of drosophila reaper, was found in silkworm <cit> . bmreaper has both ibm and gh <dig> domain, which can bind to bmiap and induce apoptosis in insect cells. the homolog bmhtra <dig> was also found in the silkworm and cloned .

tnfsf and their receptors in silkworm
tnf family ligands and their corresponding receptors  have pivotal roles in many important physiological processes, such as host defense, inflammation, apoptosis, autoimmunity and immune system organogenesis. the tnf-related ligands are type ii  transmembrane proteins containing a tnf homology domain  at the extracellular c terminus. protein sequences of  <dig> tnfsf ligands in mammals <cit>  and the tnf ligand eiger in drosophila <cit>  used as queries were aligned with the silkworm predicted protein database by blastp. two tnfsf members, bm <dig> and bm <dig>  were identified. they are located on chromosome  <dig> . bm <dig> and bm <dig> possess the typical thd as predicted , and demonstrated that potential tnf ligands are present in bombyx mori. the phylogenetic tree of tnfsf between silkworm and other species show that bm <dig> and the insect eiger homolog are in one cluster, while bm <dig> and tnfsf <dig> are classified close together, but the two tnf ligand homologs are evolutionarily distant , all of which indicate that a gene deletion or duplication event might had happened.

using sequence information from  <dig> tnfr superfamily  proteins <cit>  from mammals and one tnfrsf protein from insects, a search for possible tnf receptors was performed in bombyx mori, but no match to the tnfr domains was found. however, many predicted proteins  possessed all the structural motifs, such as a cysteine-rich domain, ca2+-binding site, and receptor/ligand interaction site , but did not meet our criteria. however, homologs containing dds  such as bmdaxx and bmfadd, were found in the silkworm.

expression profiles of apoptosis-related genes in silkworm
ests analysis
in order to detect the expression of the bombyx mori apoptosis-related genes, we searched the silkworm dbest database downloaded from genbank using the putative coding sequences as queries. forty apoptotic genes matched at least one est. nine genes had complete expressed sequence tags , and the remaining genes had incomplete ests .

microarray-based gene expression profiles in different development stages
to analyze the expression of the silkworm apoptosis-related genes in different developmental stages according the chips, a blastn alignment was performed using the silkworm different developmental stage database. the results indicated that all the apoptosis-related genes contained at least one oligonucleotide probes except bmdredd, bmfadd, bmgsk <dig> , for which no probe was found. only  <dig> apoptosis-genes show higher expression than in the 3rd day of the fifth instar, when almost all genes expressed in the silkworm are present . the results revealed that the expressions of apoptosis-genes are relative low in silkworm.

the identification of apoptosis-related genes in silkworm
to test the expression of the apoptosis genes, we designed primers for  <dig> genes according to their predicted dna sequences  and carried out rt-pcr using the cdna isolated from the different development stages of silkworm and bme cells exposed to different stressors as described in the methods section. twenty three of all apoptosis-related genes tested were cloned and sequenced, five apoptosis-related genes were detected by rt-pcr but not sequenced successfully, although the pcr product sizes were consistent with the predicted sizes, and four silkworm apoptosis-related genes were not detected . overall, the expression of these genes, except a few, was relatively much lower than bmactin <dig> expression . the results show that most of the key apoptosis-genes in silkworm are expressed, which revealed that these potential apoptosis-genes are present in bombyx mori.

discussion
the silkworm apoptosis-related genes
in this study, we identified and cloned  <dig> silkworm apoptosis-related genes, including homologs of almost all the key genes involved in apoptosis pathways in other species. the fact that the bh3-only subfamily only existed in vertebrates, while the rhg family is found only in insects, reveals conservation within species and the variability among the species, although their functional homologs exist in mammals. moreover, the main families of apoptosis-related genes exist in all model organisms, but the gene numbers in some species  are much higher, indicating that expansion might have occurred in these species, most likely due to environmental stress.

the key genes involved in apoptosis pathways in bombyx mori are described in detail in table  <dig>  interestingly, tnfsf members containing dds, caspase family members involved in inflammation, and the bh3-only bcl- <dig> family members are not found in bombyx mori. however, the silkworm not only has an insect eiger homolog bm <dig>  but also has bm <dig>  which is similar to mammalian tnfsf <dig>  neither of which have been reported in either drosophila or mosquito. these results suggest that some genes may be lost in evolution. the new putative effector caspase bmcaspase-n was found in silkworms, but not in mosquitoes  <cit>  or drosophila, suggesting that gene expansion occurred in bombyx mori after the insect diverged from the common ancestor. for example, since bmdroncs only has a card and a small subunit that lacking the core active site, it may act as a caspase-like decoy molecule  <cit> . furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of caspase family members in bombyx mori with those involved in apoptotic pathways in other species shows that caspase- <dig> homologs lacking ded domains in insects are clustered into the same class, which suggests that the caspase- <dig> homology gene mutation might have occurred after divergence of animals and insects. in contrast, the presence of all caspase- <dig> homologs in the same class suggests caspase- <dig> is highly conserved from insects to mammals . in addition, bmbruce has an ubiquitin-proteasome binding motif, which suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be present in bombyx mori, as in drosophila  <cit> .

the possible apoptosis pathways of bombyx mori
the apoptosis-related factors identified in silkworms cover almost all the critical junctions in the apoptosis pathways of other model organisms. although fas and its receptor were not found, we found some proteins predicted containing cysteine regions, ca2+ binding sites, or the typical receptor/ligand interaction sites of tnfrsf members , downstream genes such as bmtraf family members and bmfadd, which contain dds, and bmdredd. all these results suggest that the death receptor pathway may be present in bombyx mori. we hypothesize that the epidermal growth factor pathway also exists in bombyx mori, because homologs of the mammalian members of this pathway were cloned and identified in bombyx mori, including bmraf, bmras, bmpka, bmpkc, bmerk, bmpi3k, bmstat, bmakt, bmgsk <dig>  and bmfkhr. the bombyx mori homologs of cyt c, apaf- <dig>  caspase- <dig>  aif, endo g, and htra <dig> were identified and characterized in bombyx mori, and kumarswamy and colleagues  <cit>  and the pan group  <cit>  have demonstrated cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm in stress-induced apoptotic sf- <dig> and bme cells. therefore, the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway may be functional in bombyx mori. furthermore, the dmreaper orthologs found in bombyx mori indicate that this apoptotic gene is conserved between species. in addition, key genes in the dna damage response pathway, like bmp <dig> and bmsir <dig>  are also identified, so we hypothesize that the dna damage pathway is also functional in bombyx mori. in conclusion, the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways described in other models may potentially exist in bombyx mori.

in  <dig> silkworm hemolymph was used as an additional agent in cell culture in vitro  <cit> . rhee and colleagues confirmed that silkworm hemolymph inhibited cell apoptosis not only in a baculovirus-induced insect cell system  <cit>  but also in a human cell system  <cit> . in  <dig>  this group reported that they isolated and characterized an apoptosis-inhibiting hemolymph component  <cit> . later they constructed a recombinant vector to express the protein and purify it in vitro, and confirmed this protein is one of the 30k proteins isolated from silkworm hemolymph used to minimize cell death. they speculated that the 30kc <dig> protein inhibits the apoptosis by involvement upstream of caspase <dig> activation  <cit> . therefore, there might be differences between bombyx mori and other models in the regulation of apoptosis. questions remain as to the precise regulation of apoptosis in bombyx mori: for example, the central role of bmreaper, as well its homolog in drosophila, and whether bmcytc is released from the mitochondria as in mammals. also, the bh3-only bcl- <dig> family members that link the two primary apoptotic pathways are not found in bombyx mori and have not been reported in insects. identification of a surrogate protein that performs the same function would provide great insight into apoptosis in the silkworm.

CONCLUSIONS
biochemical evidence and comparative genomic analyses with mammals and other organisms show that many apoptosis-related gene homologs are present in bombyx mori, and suggest that the typical apoptotic pathways exist in bombyx mori. the identification of these new genes in bombyx mori further supports the universality of apoptotic mechanisms. the data in this study provide an overview for putative apoptosis-related genes in bombyx mori, which should contribute to mechanistic studies of apoptosis in bombyx mori in the future.
