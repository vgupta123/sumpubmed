BACKGROUND
homologous recombination  is a major error-free pathway of dsb repair found in all organisms thus far examined . extensive studies of hr repair mechanisms in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that hr requires members of the rad <dig> epistasis group, including rad <dig>  mre <dig>  xrs <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  and rad <dig>  <cit> . more recent studies of hr mechanisms in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe have revealed many similarities with hr in s. cerevisiae and have led to many insights into the mechanisms of hr-dependent dsb repair and the identification of novel genes with homologues in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . for example, rhp51-interacting proteins such as the swi5-sfr <dig> mediator complex function in a separate pathway from rhp55-rhp <dig> to promote an rhp <dig> strand exchange reaction  <cit> . furthermore, the fbh <dig> gene encodes a protein consisting of a unique domain architecture, with n-terminal f-box and c-terminal dna helicase domains  <cit> , which is conserved in mammals but not in s. cerevisiae. the fbh <dig> protein was originally identified as a 3' to 5' dna helicase that is stimulated by rpa at low atp concentrations  <cit> . the helicase domain of fbh <dig> is structurally related to the rep, uvrd, pcra, and srs <dig> family of helicases  <cit> . previous studies have shown that s. cerevisiae srs <dig> regulates rad52-dependent hr by actively disrupting the rad <dig> nucleoprotein filament  <cit> . interestingly, in contrast to fbh <dig>  srs <dig> is conserved in budding and fission yeasts but not in mammals. in s. pombe, the fbh1Δ mutation is lethal when combined with the srs2Δ mutation, and this synthetic lethality can be suppressed by a loss of hr functions  <cit> . recently, chiolo et al. reported that human fbh <dig>  suppresses specific recombination defects of s. cerevisiae srs <dig> mutants and that the f-box domain is essential for hfbh <dig> functions in this respect  <cit> . thus, the fbh <dig> and srs <dig> helicases appear to have only partially analogous functions in controlling hr after the formation of rhp <dig> nucleoprotein filaments.

f-box proteins were first characterized as components of scf ubiquitin-ligase complexes containing skp <dig>  cullin, and f-box proteins, in which they bind substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis  <cit> . the f-box motif consists of 40– <dig> amino acids and is required for binding to skp <dig>  therefore, the f-box motif links f-box proteins to other components of the scf complex. indeed, hfbh <dig> was shown to form an scf complex and to have ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro  <cit> . however, the physiological substrates of scffbh <dig> are still unknown.

in this study, we characterize the in vivo function of fbh <dig>  focusing on the role of its f-box and helicase domains. our results demonstrate that the f-box domain of fbh <dig> is required for its recruitment to the nucleus and to dna damage sites, whereas the helicase domain is involved in dna processing after the rhp51-dependent step of hr. thus, both domains have indispensable but distinct roles in fbh <dig> functions, and assembly of the scffbh <dig> complex is a prerequisite for its dna recombination activities.

RESULTS
construction of fbh <dig> mutants with substitutions in the f-box or helicase motif
fbh <dig> has a highly conserved n-terminal f-box motif and seven c-terminal helicase motifs. to gain insights into the roles of the f-box and helicase motifs in dna repair, we constructed two fbh <dig> mutants, fbh1-fb and fbh1-hl, in which alanine replaces the pro <dig> and leu <dig> residues within the f-box motif and the lys <dig> residue within the walker a motif of the helicase domain, respectively . the highly conserved pro <dig> and leu <dig> residues in the f-box motif are essential for binding to skp <dig>  <cit> , and lys <dig> is a conserved catalytic residue in the walker a motif essential for atpase activity  <cit> . to determine whether the fbh1-fb mutant is defective in binding to skp <dig>  we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using ha-tagged skp <dig> and gfp-tagged versions of fbh <dig>  gfp-fused fbh <dig>  fbh1-fb, fbh1-hl, or fbh1-fb/hl alleles were integrated into the genome at the ars <dig> locus in an fbh1Δ strain and expressed under the control of the nmt <dig> promoter. gfp-fbh <dig> complemented the repair deficiency of the fbh <dig> deletion strain   <cit> , indicating that gfp-fbh <dig> and fbh <dig> function similarly in vivo. we found that wild type fbh <dig> and fbh1-hl, but not fbh1-fb, co-immunoprecipitated with ha-tagged skp <dig> , indicating that the fbh1-fb mutation prevents association with scf components.

the role of the f-box domain
the fbh1Δ mutation confers hypersensitivity to dna damaging agents and suppresses the slow growth of a rad22Δ strain, which is defective in an orthologue of s. cerevisiae rad <dig>  <cit> . to examine the effect of the fbh <dig> mutations on these phenotypes, they were introduced into the s. pombe genome at the endogenous fbh <dig> locus. the fbh1-fb mutation conferred methyl methanesulfonate  and bleomycin sensitivities similar to those of the fbh1Δ mutant, and it suppressed the poor growth phenotype of the rad22Δ strain to a similar extent as the fbh1Δ mutation . thus, the fbh1-fb mutant is defective in binding to skp <dig>  and the fbh1-fb mutation behaves like the fbh1Δ mutation with respect to dna damage sensitivity and the suppression of the poor growth of rad22Δ cells. these results are consistent with a recent study showing that hfbh <dig> suppresses the hypersensitivity of s. cerevisiae srs2Δ cells to dna damaging agents and that the f-box domain of hfbh <dig> is essential for this effect  <cit> . in another study, osman et al. showed that the f-box domain plays a minor role in fbh <dig> function because an f-box mutant  created in a previous study has no or little sensitivity to dna damaging agents  <cit> . this discrepancy may arise from the use of different f-box mutants. our f-box mutant  is completely defective in binding to skp <dig>  while in the previous study, the fbh <dig> l14a/p15a mutant had not been characterized in this regard. we suppose that the fbh <dig> l14a/p15a mutation may not fully inactivate the f-box, as previously discussed  <cit> .

the role of the dna helicase domain
we next examined the effect of the fbh1-hl mutation on fbh <dig> function. the fbh1-hl mutant shows greater sensitivity to dna damaging agents than does the fbh1Δ mutant . in addition, ectopic expression of the fbh1-hl allele renders wild type cells sensitive to mms, suggesting that the fbh1-hl alteration is a dominant mutation . previous studies suggest that fbh <dig> promotes hr repair by controlling the action of rhp <dig>  <cit> , which contributes to the suppression of inappropriate recombination events. therefore, one possibility to explain the fbh1-hl-dependent toxic phenotype is that toxic recombination intermediates caused by faulty rhp51-dependent hr accumulate to a greater extent in the fbh1-hl mutant than in the fbh1Δ mutant. to test this possibility, we examined the mms sensitivity of the fbh1-hl strain in an rhp51Δ background. as expected, fbh1-hl cells were as sensitive to mms as fbh1Δ cells with the rhp51Δ background . these results indicate that fbh1-hl is not only defective in fbh <dig> function but also that it interferes with rhp51-dependent hr. in addition, the fbh1-hl mutation does not suppress the poor growth of rad22Δ cells, but rather, it exacerbates their decreased growth rate . however, the fbh1-fb/hl mutant, which has alterations within both the f-box and walker a motifs, is as sensitive to dna damaging agents as the fbh1-fb or fbh1Δ strains , and mutations affecting both domains suppress the slow growth phenotype of the rad22Δ strain , suggesting that f-box activity is likely to be a prerequisite for helicase activity. thus, the f-box and dna helicase domains play indispensable but distinct roles in fbh <dig> function.

focus formation of fbh <dig> mutants in response to dna damage
since gfp-fbh <dig> is predominantly detected in the nucleus and forms foci in response to dna damage  <cit> , we assessed dna damage-induced focus formation in the fbh <dig> mutants. exponentially growing cells were incubated in emm <dig> medium containing  <dig> % mms in the absence of thiamine for  <dig> h, and gfp-fbh <dig> was localized by fluorescence microscopy. the levels of expression of the gfp-fused wild type fbh <dig> and of the three mutant fbh <dig> proteins were comparable . five percent of untreated cells expressing wild type gfp-fbh <dig> contained foci, and 47% of these cells contained foci following mms treatment . interestingly, no foci were visible in cells expressing gfp-fbh1-fb, even after exposure to mms , indicating that the f-box domain is required for fbh <dig> focus formation. in contrast, 27% of untreated cells expressing gfp-fbh1-hl had foci, and this percentage was dramatically larger than that of cells expressing wild type gfp-fbh <dig> . following mms treatment, the proportion of cells with foci further increased to 78% . one possible explanation for the increased focus formation of fbh1-hl cells is that fbh1-hl can localize to dna damage sites but not complete dna processing because it lacks helicase activity, leading to its accumulation at these sites and interference with the hr pathway. moreover, the additional presence of the f-box mutation almost abolished focus formation in fbh1-hl cells irrespective of the presence of dna damage . taken together, these results suggest that the f-box domain is required for the recruitment of fbh <dig> to dna damage sites and that the helicase domain is required to mediate the hr process.

fbh <dig> is required for the dna damage-induced formation of skp <dig> nuclear foci
since fbh <dig> is assembled into the scf complex, we next examined the subcellular localization of skp <dig> by fusing yfp to its n terminus. the resulting fusion protein was expressed from a plasmid under the control of the nmt <dig> promoter. yfp-skp <dig> functions normally in vivo, since it fully complements the temperature sensitivity of an skp1ts mutant . when the yfp-skp <dig> was expressed in fbh1Δ cells expressing wild-type fbh <dig> or fbh1-fb, it was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with a higher level of the protein in the nucleus. yfp-skp <dig> foci were not detected in fbh1Δ cells expressing wild type fbh <dig>  but following  <dig> h exposure to mms, most of the cells had nuclear foci . remarkably, fbh1Δ cells expressing the fbh1-fb mutant did not have any yfp-skp <dig> foci, even in the presence of mms . wild-type fbh <dig> and fbh1-fb were expressed at a similar level . thus, these results indicate that skp <dig> focus formation is dependent on the f-box domain of fbh <dig> 

the f-box domain is responsible for the nuclear localization of fbh1
in the course of our studies, we noticed that the fbh1-fb mutation affected the subcellular localization of fbh <dig>  as shown in fig. 3b, fbh1-fb and fbh1-fb/hl showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization and little gfp signal was seen in the nucleus, in striking contrast with the subcellular localization of wild type fbh <dig>  these results indicate that the fbh1-fb mutation disturbs the nuclear localization of fbh <dig>  although this interpretation could explain why the fbh1-fb mutation confers an fbh <dig> null phenotype and suppresses the toxic phenotypes of the fbh1-hl mutation, it is still unknown whether scffbh <dig> complex formation is required for dna damage-induced nuclear focus formation. to test this possibility, a nls sequence from the simian virus  <dig> large-t antigen   <cit>  was fused to the gfp-fbh <dig> and gfp-fbh1-fb constructs at their n termini, and focus formation in response to dna damage was examined. as with gfp-fbh <dig> cells, these constructs were integrated into the genome at the ars <dig> locus in the fbh1Δ strain. control experiments showed that nls-gfp-fbh <dig> but not nls-gfp-fbh1-fb complemented the mms sensitivity of the fbh1Δ strain . as expected, nls-gfp-fbh <dig> formed discrete foci in cells exposed to mms . nls-gfp-fbh1-fb was also detected in the nucleus like wild type fbh <dig>  but it still failed to form foci in response to dna damage . these results suggest that the f-box domain is required for the nuclear localization and dna damage-induced focus formation of fbh <dig>  it should be noted that the gfp-f-box domain mutant could not enter the nucleus , suggesting that in addition to the f-box domain, another domain of fbh <dig> might also be important for its nuclear targeting.

an important unresolved issue is the identification of physiological substrates of scffbh <dig> that presumably regulate the hr pathway. a recent study has shown that hfbh <dig> has a short half-life when it is expressed in s. cerevisiae, and its degradation depends on the presence of a functional f-box and yeast scf components  <cit> , suggesting that one candidate for a scfhfbh <dig> substrate is hfbh <dig> itself. the rapid turnover of hfbh <dig> might contribute to the tight regulation of hfbh <dig> helicase activity. however, if scfhfbh <dig> complex formation is also necessary for its nuclear transport and recruitment to dna damage sites, the alteration in subcellular localization caused by the f-box mutation might affect hfbh <dig> stability in budding yeast cells. in addition, many f-box proteins identified to date target more than one substrate for degradation  <cit> . since our present data suggest that fbh <dig> functions as an scffbh <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex for hr repair, the most plausible candidates as scffbh <dig> substrates are hr proteins, including rhp <dig>  for example, scffbh <dig> might contribute to regulate rhp51-dependent hr by promoting the ubiquitination of rhp <dig> or other recombination proteins. future studies will be needed to determine whether fbh <dig> is a physiological scffbh <dig> substrate and to identify other scffbh <dig> substrates, which would provide a means to conduct a more detailed analysis of its function in hr repair.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we characterized the in vivo function of fbh <dig>  focusing on the role of its f-box and helicase domains. our results show that the assembly of scffbh <dig> mediated by the f-box domain of fbh <dig> is required for its recruitment to both the nucleus and dna damage sites, whereas the helicase domain is involved in controlling the action of rhp <dig>  thus, fbh <dig> is tightly regulated by scf components, which might prevent it from functioning inappropriately in hr.
