BACKGROUND
much recent attention in genomics has focused on bacterial endosymbionts of insects, including the ubiquitous wolbachia  <cit> , the sap-feeder symbionts buchnera, baumannia, and sulcia  <cit> , and several others  <cit> . many of these symbionts bring unique metabolic capabilities to their hosts, allowing these insects to flourish on diets which otherwise would be difficult to utilize. less attention has been given to viral endosymbionts. bracoviruses  and ichnoviruses  form subgroups of polydnaviruses  that have evolved as obligate endosymbionts of braconid and ichneumonid endoparasitoid wasps, respectively, and appear to provide their primary hosts with pathogenic abilities  <cit> . endoparasitoid wasps primarily parasitize other insects and usually kill the host organism they develop in. most endoparasitoid wasps, including those that house pdvs, utilize a particularly difficult developmental strategy, known as koinobioncy, whereby the host continues to develop after it has been parasitized. wasp eggs therefore begin development in a hostile environment in which they come under attack from the host's immune system. pdvs disrupt these responses.

members of polydnaviridae represent the only known viruses with segmented double-stranded dna genomes  <cit> . they exist in two forms: as an asymptomatic proviral form integrated into the genome of male and female wasps  <cit> , and as virions. proviral dna is amplified from wasp genomic dna, and viral genome segments are excised, circularized, and packaged into virus particles only within specialized ovarian calyx cells of females  <cit> . virions are released into the reproductive tract and do not appear to cause any ill effects. during oviposition, virions, along with wasp eggs and other factors, are injected into a secondary host, usually a caterpillar, where viral gene expression facilitates endoparasitoid survival by disrupting secondary host immunity, physiology, and development  <cit> . additional wasp factors such as venom, ovarian proteins, and egg-associated teratocytes may contribute to parasitism success. virus particles do not replicate within the secondary  host, yet viral-mediated pathology ensures perpetuation of the proviral form of the virus within the parasitoid life cycle.

pdvs are involved in a highly successful triad of mutualistic-parasitic relationships: it is estimated that there are over  <dig>  wasp-pdv associations, with each wasp species exhibiting specific preferences in the host range they parasitize  <cit> . drawing parallels from mitochondrial and bacterial endosymbiont genome evolution, some have hypothesized that pdvs are the product of reductive viral evolution  <cit> . viral terminology is used to describe pdvs, although many unusual aspects of their biology have called into question this classification. eukaryote-like genome properties and functional similarities between some pdv genes and components of wasp ovarian fluid have led to the suggestion that pdvs are not viruses at all, but rather represent genetic delivery vehicles that have acquired a virus-like packaging system and have evolved to transfer wasp parasitism genes to the lepidopteran host  <cit> . the evolutionary history of pdvs is further obscured by the hypothesis that, despite gross similarities in form and function, bvs and ivs have evolved independently  <cit> . bracoviruses, however, are thought to be monophyletic, as all bracovirus-bearing wasps form a clade which originated ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

to date six pdv viral genomes have been sequenced: ccbv and mdbv, bvs associated with the braconid wasps cotesia congregata and microplitis demolitor, respectively, and csiv, hfiv, and triv, ivs associated with the ichneumonids campoletis sonorensis, hyposoter fugitivus, and tranosema rostrale  <cit> . the sixth sequenced pdv, which is associated with the banchine ichneumonid glypta fumiferanae, is hypothesized to form a third independent lineage of pdvs  <cit> . the packaged genomes of these viruses consist of between  <dig> and  <dig> circular segments and have aggregate sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kbp. unlike typical viruses only 17–30% of the viral genomes code for proteins, many genes are predicted to contain introns, and no genes code for obvious components of a dna replication or transcription machinery. thus, host enzymes may be utilized during construction of virus particles and/or viral genes may constitute part of proviral sequences which do not get packed into virus particles. in csiv there is evidence for partitioning of genes encoding protein components of the virus particle between packaged and non-packaged genomic dna  <cit> , although no similar example has been shown for bvs. compartmentalization of genes that are needed to maintain the pdv life cycle complicates study of virus biology and raises questions on the definition of sequences that constitute a pdv proviral genome.

while pdv viral genomes are better characterized, information on proviral genomes is limited. studies on the location of proviral genome segment sequences in csiv suggest that iv proviral genomes are integrated at multiple loci in the wasp genome  <cit> . by contrast, it is thought that bv proviral genome segments are tandemly arrayed in a single locus and separated by short intervening sequences  <cit> . the latter hypothesis is based on studies of ccbv and cibv in which proviral genome segments were flanked, at least on one end, by a different proviral genome segment  <cit>  and a fluorescent in situ hybridization mapping study in which probes from three different ccbv viral genome segments hybridized to the same region of a single wasp chromosome  <cit> .

the current model for production of bv viral segment sequences is that one or more large precursor molecules encompassing multiple proviral viral genome segments are excised from genomic dna and amplified, and this dna forms the substrate from which viral segments are excised  <cit> . according to studies of ccbv and cibv , all amplification of bv dna occurs at the level of the precursor molecule–no amplification occurs following excision of viral genome segments  <cit> . the dna sequence at the segmental boundaries of a limited number of proviral genome segments of csiv, cibv and ccbv have been studied  <cit> , and, in each, a direct dna sequence repeat occurs at the boundaries. proviral genome segment sequences are excised from the precursor molecules at these repeats, possibly via conservative site-specific recombination, and a single copy of the repeat is retained within the circularized viral segment  <cit> . additionally, genome segments are packaged into virus particles in different abundances  <cit> . recent semi-quantitative studies have shown large differences in copy number in both viral  and proviral  forms of segments  <cit> . the details of this phenomenon and its relationship to amplification and excision are unknown.

here we describe the analyses of a  <dig> kbp section of genomic dna from the braconid glyptapanteles indiensis which parasitizes gypsy moth. this region contains  <dig> proviral genome segments of g. indiensis bracovirus . our data provide new insight into bv proviral genome structure, as not all gibv viral genome segment sequences are linked in a single tandem array in the wasp genome. conserved dna sequences identified at the junctions of gibv proviral genome segment sequences and in gibv, ccbv and mdbv viral segments suggest that sequence motifs governing segment excision are highly conserved across bracoviruses. analyses of gibv viral segment sequence polymorphism data indicate that widespread selection acts on non-coding dna, suggesting additional functional motifs or non-coding rnas are present in the gibv viral genome. finally, there is a marked difference in nucleotide composition between proviral segment sequences and flanking dna that is not packaged into virus particles.

RESULTS
partial sequence characterization of gibv viral dna
viral dna was subjected to whole genome shotgun sequencing using purified virus pooled from the calyx fluid of ~ <dig> female wasps from an outbred population. as judged by sizing on agarose gels, the gibv viral genome was expected to contain  <dig> segments with a genome size of ~ <dig> kbp  <cit> . however, assembly of our preliminary sequence data indicate an aggregate genome size of ~ <dig> kbp and ~ <dig> different segments. many segments are of similar sizes and would have co-migrated on agarose gels. a high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism   and insertions and deletions  in the dna of the viral population that was sampled complicated the closure phase of the sequencing project. nevertheless,  <dig> of the  <dig> preliminary viral genome segment sequences were of sufficient quality to allow development of segment-specific pcr primers . these primers were used to determine the proviral genome segment composition of bac clones that hybridized with 32p-labeled gibv viral dna. priority was given to closing sequence and physical gaps in  <dig> viral genome segments that were encoded by two overlapping bac clones . a consensus sequence was generated for each viral genome segment , and the resulting sequences, which varied in length from  <dig> to  <dig> kbp, were deposited in genbank . individual sequence reads were deposited in the ncbi trace archive .

identification of bac clones containing gibv proviral dna
radioactive probes derived from total gibv viral dna hybridized at varying intensity to  <dig> clones from a bac library of  <dig>  clones made from the larvae of g. indiensis. nineteen viral genome segment-specific pcrs were used to genotype  <dig> bac clones to determine the proviral genome segment composition. these bac clones segregated into  <dig> sets that contained non-overlapping profiles of viral genome segments . each set contained  <dig> to  <dig> proviral genome segments, and in total  <dig> of the  <dig> proviral genome segments were identified. additionally, a sub-set of  <dig> bac clones were fingerprinted using ecori and the resulting restriction enzyme patterns were used to place the bac clones into overlapping contigs. this method of clustering was consistent with the results of the segment-specific pcrs .

non-overlapping sets of proviral genome segments found in bac clones, arbitrarily designated as set 1– <dig>  are shown in column  <dig>  the second column shows the number of proviral genome segments identified in each set. the third column shows the number of bacs which tested positive for that set, and the fourth column shows the number of bacs that were tested for that set. some segment sets were tested for on less than  <dig> bac clones, as once multiple clones were identified for a set of proviral genome segments, the primer pairs representing those sets of segments were removed from pcr experiments to reduce the number of pcrs needed to identify the entire proviral genome.

structure and composition of gibv proviral locus 1
two overlapping bac clones that appeared to code for a cluster of  <dig> proviral genome segments were selected for sequencing. bac clones 18i <dig> and 20d <dig> were  <dig>  kbp and  <dig>  kbp in length, respectively, and overlapped by  <dig>  bp. the region of sequence overlap contained  <dig> snps, indicating the bac clones were derived from different individuals from a population of g. indiensis. a contiguous dna sequence was generated by fusing positions 1– <dig>  of clone 18i <dig> with positions  <dig> – <dig>  of clone 20d <dig>  resulting in a region spanning  <dig>  bp. the annotated dna sequence was deposited in genbank .

the coordinates of the  <dig> proviral genome segment sequences in this region were determined by aligning viral genome segment sequences to it. a search of the bac sequences against the entire assembly of viral genome segment shotgun sequence data led to the identification and closure of an extra viral genome segment sequence. this assembly was not of high enough quality for primer design during the bac clone screening phase. thus, a cluster of  <dig> proviral genome segments labeled 1p to 8p separated by  <dig> inter-segmental regions  that vary in length from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  kbp occupies ~ <dig> kbp of dna which we call gibv proviral locus  <dig>  interestingly, the  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp region of dna that flank locus  <dig> contain a 6– <dig> kbp section of dna  consisting primarily of non-coding tandem dna sequence repeats .

coordinates are with respect to the sequence of the entire locus. the % g+c column is divided into coding  and non-coding  for regions predicted to encode genes.

a variety of nucleotide compositional differences exist between the flanking regions i-iv, inter-segmental regions, and proviral genome segments. the latter sequences and l1r1/l1r <dig> have the highest average g+c content , followed by the flanking regions  while the inter-segmental regions have the lowest g+c content . the difference in g+c content between coding and non-coding dna is greater in flanking regions i-iv  than in proviral genome segment sequences  . relative dinucleotide frequencies which correct for background g+c composition were calculated for each region >  <dig> bp in length, except l1r <dig> and l1r <dig> as tandemly repetitive sequences have highly biased dinucleotide frequencies. neighbor-joining clustering of the distances derived from these data  revealed that all of the proviral genome segments cluster together and have a highly similar dinucleotide composition, which is distinct from flanking dna. regions i and iv clustered together and the most distantly from proviral genome segments, whereas regions ii and iii and the inter-segmental regions clustered between the proviral genome segments and regions i and iv.

a conserved dna sequence motif exists at proviral genome segment junctions
visual examination of the dna sequence at the junctions between gibv proviral genome segments and inter-segmental regions led to the identification of a  <dig> bp direct sequence repeat , which is perfectly conserved at  <dig> of the  <dig> junctions and has one nucleotide substitution at the remaining  <dig> junctions. because this repeat is encoded on the top dna strand for  <dig> proviral genome segments  and the bottom dna strand for the remaining  <dig> proviral genome segments , the 5' and 3' boundaries of a proviral genome segment were defined as the first and second copy of the agcttt repeat relative to the sequence depicted in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> junction sequences were separated into 5' and 3' boundaries and searched using meme, a motif discovery tool. an extended sequence motif centered on the agcttt repeat was identified in each group of sequences. the 5' and 3' motifs are different to each other and the 5' motif is more conserved than the 3' motif. conservation of both motifs was greater and longer on the segmental side of the excision site than on the inter-segmental side .

meme analysis of the  <dig> gibv viral genome segment sequences revealed the presence of a single copy of the agcttt repeat surrounded by a recombined motif from the 5' and 3' motifs . by comparing proviral and viral genome segment sequences, it was determined that the two nucleotide polymorphisms present in the agcttt repeat of the proviral genome segment sequences appeared in the single copy of the repeat in viral genome segment sequences. specifically, the 5' repeat of segment 5p has a substitution at the fifth position while the 3' repeat of segment 3p has a substitution at the first position and both changes occur in the corresponding viral segment.

meme was also used to search the complete ccbv and mdbv viral genomes, and the  <dig> available viral genome segments of cibv. a sequence motif highly similar to the recombined gibv segment motif was found in all  <dig> ccbv viral genome segments and  <dig> out of  <dig> mdbv viral genome segments . no similar motif was found in cibv, although described cibv exision sites show conservation of varying degrees to the agcttt repeat  <cit> .

annotation of proviral locus  <dig> and flanking dna
two previously described gibv cdnas  expressed in infected gypsy moth larvae  <cit>  which encode hypothetical proteins map to multiple genes in proviral locus  <dig>  these cdnas provide direct evidence for the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> introns in the p <dig> and p <dig> gene families, respectively; p <dig> maps to  <dig> genes in proviral genome segment 2p, while p <dig> maps to  <dig> gene of proviral genome segment 3p, 4p, and 5p. the shortest and longest intron was  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length, respectively. four variations of ab initio gene modeling programs were tested for their ability to recover the correct intron-exon structure of these  <dig> genes. a combination of softberry's fgenesh trained on the honey bee  and the beijing genome institute's bgf trained on the silkmoth  were most accurate and these programs, in addition to protein alignments generated with the aat package  <cit>  were used to predict protein-coding gene models .

a total of  <dig> protein-coding genes were predicted to be encoded within the  <dig> proviral genome segments . as judged by sequence similarity using blastp,  <dig> genes have homologs in ccbv, but only  <dig> genes, all of which are members of hypothetical family  <dig>  have homologs in mdbv. a tblastn analysis of the predicted gibv proteins against the mdbv and ccbv genomes showed no additional similarity to mdbv. however, of the  <dig> proteins which did not show blastp similarity to ccbv,  <dig> showed similarity to translated ccbv sequences, suggesting homologs of these genes may exist in ccbv but were not previously predicted. the  <dig> remaining gibv genes which do not have homologs in ccbv encode novel hypothetical proteins.

gene identifier indicates the genbank locus tag for each predicted gene. region is the location of genes according to the delineations in table  <dig>  sizes of the genes are given in amino acids. signatures  include "s" signal peptide, "t" trans-membrane domain, and "g" potential glycosylphosphatidylinisotol anchor. family indicates the gene family to which the predicted gene belongs, if any. dn/ds ratios are given when applicable, and an "*" represents insufficient data to calculate a ratio, while a "u" represents a mathematically undefined ratio.

only  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted gibv genes in the locus were assigned a potential function, namely c-type lectins and proteins containing a cystatin or ribonuclease t <dig> domain . surprisingly,  <dig> genes were predicted to access the secretory pathway as they contained a signal peptide at the n-terminus. of these  <dig> genes were predicted to have trans-membrane domains, and  <dig> genes were predicted to have potential glycosylphosphatidylinisotol anchors. only  <dig> proviral genome segment genes were not predicted to contain introns and the remaining genes contain either  <dig> or  <dig> introns. a protein domain-based clustering pipeline placed  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins into  <dig> gene families . the distribution of members of these gene families was generally not restricted to specific proviral genome segments– <dig> gene families, including all families with  <dig> members or more, were located on at least  <dig> non-adjoining proviral genome segments.

regions l1r <dig> and l1r <dig> and the inter-segmental regions were not predicted to contain protein-coding genes, nor did these sequences produce any significant matches when tested against the genbank non-redundant protein database using blastx . on the other hand, regions i to iv were predicted to encode  <dig> genes and potential function was assigned to  <dig> of them . these genes had a top blast hit to genes from apis mellifera , including the 5'-nucleotidase, trans-2-enoyl-coa reductase, hyaluronidase, n-myristoyltransferase, and  <dig> hypothetical protein. by contrast, none of the genes encoded by the proviral genome segments had any sequence similarity to a. mellifera , other than proteins with conserved domains encoded in a large number of genomes . four of  <dig> genes are encoded on a. mellifera chromosome  <dig>  although only the honey bee hyaluronidase and n-myristoyltransferase genes were located in close proximity to each other.

analysis of sequence polymorphisms in gibv viral genome segment sequences
proviral genome segments in locus  <dig> share  <dig> – <dig> % sequence identity with their homologous viral genome segment sequence. the distribution of  <dig>  snps in the  <dig> gibv viral genome segment sequences relative to the corresponding proviral genome segment sequence is shown in table  <dig>  viral genome segment  <dig> showed a low frequency of polymorphisms, averaging ~ <dig> snps/kbp, while the remaining segments had an average snp density of ~ <dig> snps/kbp. the majority of genome segments showed no significant correlation between sequence coverage and snp density , with the exception of segment  <dig>  which showed a slight correlation . all snps were placed in one of three classes: non-coding, synonymous, and non-synonymous. as expected, there was a significantly higher snp density in synonymous sites than non-synonymous sites . however, there was also a higher snp density in synonymous sites relative to non-coding sites , and no difference in snp density between non-coding and non-synonymous sites .

*p <  <dig> 

coverage indicates average sequence coverage across the viral genome segment in the whole genome shotgun, and r <dig> represents the correlation between the number of snps and sequence coverage. only viral genome segment  <dig> showed a significant  correlation between snp density and coverage.

the number of snps per gene ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and dn/ds ratios were calculated for the  <dig> out of  <dig> genes that contained  <dig> or more snps . most of these genes appear to be under purifying selection and  <dig> of  <dig> genes had dn/ds ratio <  <dig>  with a majority of the ratios falling in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  . three genes appear to be evolving neutrally  and code for  <dig> hypothetical proteins and  <dig> member of gene family  <dig>  four genes had a dn/ds >  <dig> , including  <dig> member each of gene families  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and an ep1-like protein. no correlation was found between dn/ds ratios and specific genome segments or gene families–most segments and gene families contained genes under different degrees of selection.

discussion
not all gibv proviral genome segments occur in a tandem array
prior to this study, it was believed that bracovirus proviral genome segments were closely linked in a tandem array in the wasp genome with short stretches of intervening dna separating them  <cit> . our study indicates that this is not the case for gibv. while some gibv proviral genome segment sequences are clustered in tandem arrays others occur in isolation as singletons. this conclusion is supported by the segregation of bac clones coding for  <dig> of ~ <dig> proviral genome segments into  <dig> non-overlapping sets of clones via viral genome segment-specific pcrs , and preliminary bac shotgun sequence data support the typing data . furthermore, although we describe a tandem array of proviral genome segments in this paper at gibv proviral locus  <dig>  the array codes for only  <dig> proviral genome segment sequences and this cluster is flanked by at least  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp of dna  that is not packaged into gibv virions. it remains to be determined whether the  <dig> loci encoding gibv proviral segment sequences are linked on the same chromosome as a macrolocus but with longer stretches of intervening dna between them, or whether they are dispersed across more than one chromosome. although the former scenario remains compatible with a study of c. congregata where probes from  <dig> different viral genome segments bound to the same location on c. congregata chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , the structural organization of bv proviral genome segment sequences appears to be more complex than previously hypothesized.

it is reasonable to propose that the inter-segmental regions in gibv proviral locus  <dig> should be classified as part of the gibv proviral genome. however, to what extent the proviral genome extends into flanking dna is less easily determined. bv viral genome segments are thought to be excised from the amplified products of one or more large precursor molecules, and there is no evidence for post-excision amplification of segments  <cit> . thus copy number studies of regions immediately flanking gibv proviral locus  <dig> and other loci containing proviral genome segment sequences at the time of viral genome segment formation could be used as a surrogate marker for identifying potential components of the gibv proviral genome.

gene content of proviral locus  <dig> and flanking regions
due to the limited transcriptional data available for bvs, there is substantial disagreement on the structural complexity of bv genes, particularly with regards to the percentage of pdv genes that contain introns. while espagne et al  <cit>  predicted that 69% of ccbv proteins contain introns, webb et al  <cit>  re-annotated the ccbv genome and predicted only  <dig> % of ccbv genes contain introns–a ten-fold difference in intron content. in gibv proviral locus  <dig>  using a combination of hymenoptera- and lepidoptera-trained gene prediction programs , we predicted that 81% of the  <dig> genes contain introns. sequence data from  <dig> cdnas derived from genes in proviral locus  <dig> suggests that the  <dig> introns predicted for  <dig> members of the  <dig> gene families are real and not artifacts of improper gene modeling. however, this number is probably not reflective of the entire gibv genome, as ptp and ankyrin genes usually do not contain introns  <cit>  and generally comprise a large percentage of bv genes , but are not present in gibv proviral locus  <dig>  regardless, the accuracy of most predicted gene models awaits experimental verification. while the presence of introns may be unusual for virus genes, some dna viruses which replicate in the host cell nucleus encode genes with introns .

gibv genes in proviral locus  <dig> predicted to contain introns have an extremely simple intron-exon structure compared to often complex higher eukaryotic genes, and generally contain a single short exon followed by a long exon encoding the remainder of the protein. remarkably, 80% of the genes at this locus, including the p <dig> and p <dig> gene families which are transcribed in infected gypsy moth larvae, are predicted to encode a secretion signal peptide within the first exon. secretion of some proteins may compensate for differences in the abundance of segment sequences in virions. since it is unclear whether the entirety of the gibv genome is packaged into a single virion  <cit> , secretion of a large number of proteins may be necessary for properly delivery of these proteins. attempts to functionally annotate the  <dig> predicted genes in the  <dig> gibv proviral genome segment sequences identified the presence of a c-type lectin  <cit> , crv1-like proteins  <cit> , and a number of conserved hypothetical proteins encoded by other pdv genomes  <cit> . most of the genes in locus  <dig> were predicted to have homologs in ccbv, while only gene family  <dig> showed homology to a gene on mdbv segment b. although the function of this gene family is unknown, it is the only gene family in gibv proviral locus  <dig> for which none of the members are predicted to contain signal peptides.

the placement of  <dig> gibv genes into  <dig> gene families suggests that extensive duplication of genes has occurred within proviral locus  <dig>  typically, gene duplications are thought to result in relaxation of the selection on the duplicated gene, allowing it to acquire a new function. however, the majority of genes in proviral locus  <dig>  even multiple members of the same gene family, appear to be under purifying selection . this implies that members of gene families are, for the most part, not free to acquire entirely new functions but may play different roles within the constraints of their gene family, such as differential targeting as seen in some inhibitors of nf-κbs  <cit>  or differential expression as seen in some ptps  <cit> . alternatively, conserved function across duplicated genes may be important for increasing the level of expression of functional classes of genes  <cit> . despite the large proportion of genes under purifying selection,  <dig> genes appear to be evolving neutrally or under diversifying selection, potentially allowing a limited set of genes to acquire new functions or adapt to changes in host defenses.

the inter-segmental regions which separate the proviral genome segments are not predicted to contain protein coding genes. however, regions that map outside of proviral locus  <dig> are predicted to contain  <dig> genes, and potential function has been assigned to some of them, e.g., n-myristoyltransferase, ecto-5'-nucleotidase, and hyaluronidase . it is interesting to note that viral proteins are often modified with a lipid tail, hyaluronidase is a component of venom  <cit>  that hydrolyzes complex carbohydrate structures allowing tissue diffusion, and ecto-5'-nucleotidase is involved in the extracellular formation of adenosine, a regulator of innate immune responses  <cit> . it is unclear whether these regions constitute part of the gibv proviral genome but there is a striking difference in the structural complexity of these predicted gene models and those present in proviral locus  <dig>  nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that proteins encoded in the flanking regions, perhaps as components of ovarian fluids, and genes that are located close to other proviral segment loci, may play a role in gibv biology. also notable is a sex-linked wasp gene coding for a homolog of female-lethal  that is present in region i. in drosophila fld plays a critical role in alternative splicing regulation of genes involved in sex determination , dosage compensation, oogenesis, and differentiation, as well as non sex-specific functions, and is expressed throughout larval and adult life  <cit> . since excision of proviral genome segments from the wasp chromosome and encapsidation into virion particles occurs only in females, it is possible that regulation of this sex-linked process is related, at least in part, to expression of fld.

a proviral genome segment excision motif is highly conserved across bracoviruses
the presence of a near perfect agcttt direct dna sequence repeat was discovered at the boundaries of proviral genome segment sequences and flanking sequences . as the viral genome segment sequences contain a single copy of this repeat, it appears to define the site of proviral genome segment excision. this suggests an excision mechanism via conservative site specific recombination as described for formation of other pdv genome segments  <cit> . the presence of two snps within this repeat at the junction of proviral segment sequences and the ability to follow these nucleotide differences from the proviral to the viral genome segments suggests that the site of proviral genome segment excision and circularization must be located between the first and fifth position within the agcttt repeat . a study of excision sites in cibv similarly concluded that gct was the preferred site of excision  <cit> .

an extended but different sequence motif around the excision site was identified at the 5' and 3' proviral genome segment junction sequences using meme and the recombined sequence motif is found on viral genome segment sequences . while sequence conservation exists on both sides of excision sites, a higher level of conservation is seen in the side of the motif which is retained in circularized segment, and in particular at the 5' junction. the asymmetry of the 5' and 3' sequence motifs suggests that there is directionality to the recognition of excision sites. since recombined sites have a different motif we predict they are no longer substrates for the excision enzymes. excision and circularization of segments from a large precursor molecule could occur via release of single segments or a smaller molecule containing multiple segments. in the latter case the segments flanking the site of circularization would no longer be available for excision. for example, if a molecule encompassing 1p through 3p in proviral locus  <dig> were excised, only 2p would remain a substrate for subsequent excision and circularization . such a pathway could contribute to differences in the abundance of packaged viral genome segments but it portrays a complex scenario. assuming that sequence coverage of a viral genome segment in our shotgun sequencing approach correlates with the abundance of the segment it is interesting to note that the gibv viral genome segments encoded in proviral locus  <dig> appear to be present in about the same levels , suggesting that generation of intermediate excision products is not a common occurrence. the sequencing data also suggest that intermediates or by-products of excision, if they occur, are excluded from the packaging process, perhaps by the presence of inter-segmental dna.

we found that the predicted site of excision/circularization and the recombined extended motif present in gibv viral genome segments is also present in ccbv and mdbv viral genome segments . conservation of the gct portion of the excision repeat sequence exists in the cibv viral genome segment sequences that are available  <cit> , although more cibv sequences will be required to determine how closely the cibv extended motif mirrors that of gibv, ccbv, and mdbv. as c. congregata, g. indiensis, and m. demolitor are all members of microgasterinae, the most derived clade of bracovirus-bearing braconids, and c. inanitus is a member of cheloninae, the most basal clade of the bracovirus-bearing wasps  <cit> , it is possible that the predicted excision motif is one of the very few sequence features that is highly conserved across bracoviruses, and provides additional support for the hypothesis that bracoviruses have a single evolutionary origin  <cit> . this observation also predicts conservation of the enzyme involved in bv proviral genome segment excision and circularization.

selective pressure on non-coding dna in proviral segment sequences in locus 1
analysis of snp data derived from sequencing the gibv viral genome from an outbred population of female wasps revealed that non-coding sites in the  <dig> viral genome segments derived from locus  <dig> had a significantly lower snp density than synonymous sites within coding dna. as we presume synonymous sites to be evolving neutrally, this result suggest that there is likely to be selective pressure on non-coding dna. the lack of difference between rates of change at non-coding and non-synonymous sites suggests that in these segment sequences, non-coding dna may be as highly conserved as coding dna. such areas could encode non-coding rnas or contain sequence motifs vital to dna replication, gene expression or segment packaging. limited experimental evidence support the idea that pdv non-coding dna is functional–studies of csiv segment b found  <dig> sequences of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kbp which are transcribed but do not encode proteins  <cit> .

proviral locus 1–a genetic island?
several differences between the cluster of  <dig> gibv proviral segment sequences which are excised and packed into virus particles and flanking dna suggest that proviral segment sequences are not simply host genetic elements evolved for the export of wasp parasitism genes. for example, the proviral segments exhibit similar nucleotide compositions to each other but their g+c composition and dinucleotide frequencies differ from those of inter-segmental regions and flanking regions i-iv . given the estimated age of the integration of bracoviruses into the wasp genome, ~ <dig> million years, and using substitution rates estimated from drosophila  <cit> , one would predict that a sufficient period of time has passed for the process of ameliorization, i.e., the adjustment over time of the nucleotide composition of the integrated dna to that of the resident genome  <cit> , to have occurred. the different nucleotide composition of the proviral segment sequences may be maintained or its ameliorization may be slowed by the purifying selection found to be acting on both non-coding and coding dna. however, as differences in nucleotide composition can be caused by different origins of dna  <cit>  or by the widespread purifying selection itself  <cit> , the origins of the compositional differences between proviral and flanking dna remain to be determined. additionally, it is possible that inter-segmental and flanking regions, rather than the proviral segment sequences, differ from the remainder of the wasp genome.

CONCLUSIONS
here we provide the first report of a  <dig> kbp region of genomic dna from the braconid glyptapanteles indiensis, and the characterization of a cluster of  <dig> proviral genome segments encoded within it. our data show that, contrary to current concepts of bracovirus proviral genome organization, the proviral segments are not entirely contained within a single tandem array in the wasp genome. however, it remains unclear whether the multiple gibv proviral loci are linked on a single wasp chromosome as a macrolocus, and how representative this pattern is of bvs as a whole. the dispersed nature of gibv proviral genome segments raises the question as to how to define proviral dna within the wasp genome. it is reasonable to propose that sequences which can be shown to be physically linked to proviral genome segment sequences within amplified precursor molecules should be classified as part of the proviral genome. whether such studies will reveal the entire composition of a proviral genome remains to be determined, as it is not known whether all genes involved in virion formation are components of precursor molecules.

our study provides, for the first time, evidence for widespread purifying selection acting on bv non-coding dna, suggesting that a large amount of the non-coding dna in bracoviral genomes may be functional. our analysis also reveals a variety of notable differences between flanking and proviral genome segment sequences. we hypothesize that selection acting on proviral dna is maintaining the distinctive nucleotide composition of the proviral genome. however, the origins of these differences remain unknown. neither proviral locus  <dig> nor any of the bv viral genomes sequenced to date encode homologs of known viral coat proteins or components of a transcription or dna replication machinery, which are often the only genes conserved enough for viral phylogenetic studies. identification of genes that perform these functions in glyptapanteles indiensis will be essential for determining whether gibv has a viral or cellular origin. as multiple lines of evidence, including the conserved excision motif described herein, support the hypothesis of a single evolutionary origin of bvs, an understanding of the evolutionary history of gibv will reveal much about the evolution of bvs as a whole.
