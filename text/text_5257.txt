BACKGROUND
the ferret  is a popular non-conventional companion animal for which a prevalence of neoplastic diseases ranging from  <dig>  to 12% has been described .

tumours of the endocrine system are the most common neoplasms in ferrets with a majority of pancreatic islet and adrenal tumours . pancreatic islet beta cell tumours represent the most frequent neoplasm and almost the totality of primary pancreatic neoplasms in ferrets . genetic and nutritional components have been postulated to predispose ferrets to the onset of this tumour type in the united states  <cit> . adrenal tumours have been reported as the second most frequent endocrine disease both in the united states and japan . the pathogenesis leading to adrenal gland disease is still debated; however, early gonadectomy combined with an artificially prolonged photoperiod experienced by indoor pet ferrets, along with a possible genetic component, seem to predispose to adrenal tumours  <cit> .

the second most common affected systems are the hemolymphatic and the integumentary system, with similar frequencies . hemolymphatic neoplasms have a slightly higher frequency in ferrets from north america  <cit> , while the contrary occurs for integumentary neoplasms in ferrets from japan  <cit> . the epidemiological similarities of neoplastic disease between japanese and u.s. ferrets could be explained by the fact that most japanese pet ferrets are imported from north america, and their husbandry, including diet, is comparable  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, there are no epidemiologic reports with reference to domestic ferret neoplastic diseases in europe and, specifically, in italy. this represents an 11-year retrospective study investigating tumour types and their prevalence in ferrets from northern italy.

methods
the electronic archives of the exotic and non-conventional companion animal diagnostic service were searched from its establishment in  <dig> till  <dig> covering a 11-year period. records of histopathological samples from ferrets  including at least one neoplastic lesion were retrieved, and data regarding gender, age, breed, site of the lesions and histological diagnoses were collected. in italy, early gonadectomy is frequent in ferrets; however the neutering status was inconsistently included, therefore, gender was categorized into male , female , neutered males , neutered females  and unknown .

tumour types were classified according to the published references or the pertinent fascicles of the world health organization “international histological classification of tumours of domestic animals”  <cit> .

neoplasms were grouped by affected organ system  with the exclusion of lymphoid neoplasms that were grouped independently from the organ or tissue of origin. cases of neoplastic diseases with low frequency were grouped in a set named “miscellaneous”. neoplasms developing in the same ferret but with different tissue of origin and different malignancy were recorded as independent neoplasms using the same identification number for the ferret. hyperplastic lesions were excluded. the diagnoses were reviewed independently by  <dig> board certified pathologists. differences between the diagnoses were discussed jointly to achieve an agreement.

RESULTS
the number of pathological specimens collected from ferrets during an 11-year period was  <dig>  of these,  <dig> samples contained at least one neoplastic lesion. multiple neoplasms occurred in  <dig> cases :  <dig> ferrets were diagnosed with two tumours,  <dig> with three,  <dig> with four, and  <dig> with five different tumours. consequently, a total of  <dig> tumours was included in this study. the tissue distribution of all neoplasms excluding lymphoid tumours is summarized in table  <dig>  the tissue distribution of lymphoid neoplasm is summarized in table  <dig> table  <dig> tissue distribution and specific diagnosis of tumors in ferrets

discussion
epidemiological information on tumours in ferrets derives from extra-european countries, mostly usa and japan . in these countries, similar distributions have been reported, with minor discrepancies on the frequency of hemolymphatic and integumentary tumours . in our study, the histologic type and tissue distribution of  <dig> neoplasms from italian ferrets is reported. a predilection of gender was not observed, and the age of affected ferrets was variable, paralleling the findings of previous reports .

additionally, similar to previous reports, endocrine neoplasms represented the majority of tumours in domestic ferrets . on the contrary, adrenal tumours were more frequent compared to pancreatic islet cell neoplasms in this report. this discrepancy can be explained partially by the criteria applied in this study to classify islet cell tumours: multiple islet cell tumours in the same sample were regarded as a single case, interpreting the development of multiple identical pancreatic neoplasms in the same animal as the consequence of the same pathological process.

most adrenal neoplasms were malignant and originated from the cortex, whereas pheochromocytomas were less common, paralleling previous observations  <cit> . similar to previous studies  <cit> , no female/male predisposition was highlighted. in fact, early gonadectomy and neutering , combined with the artificial prolonged photoperiod experienced by indoor pet ferrets are believed to predispose both genders to the development of adrenocortical tumours.

interestingly, we observed a higher frequency of mesenchymal neoplasms arising from the adrenal capsule compared with other reports . these tumours were characterized by scant amount of residual adrenal tissue and by smooth muscle differentiation in the majority of cases.

pancreatic islet cells tumours have been well characterized in ferrets over the last 20 years  <cit> , and are reported as the most common neoplasm in middle aged to older ferrets . on the contrary, islet cell tumours were the second most common neoplasm in our study, with a majority demonstrating an infiltrative growth. nevertheless, the infiltrative growth has not been demonstrated to be an indication of malignancy in these tumours  <cit> . a slight prevalence of male ferrets was observed; this statement is in agreement with previous reports  <cit> .

cutaneous and subcutaneous mast cell tumours were the most frequent skin neoplasms, followed by sebaceous and apocrine gland tumours. this data parallels one study reporting mast cell tumour as one of the most frequent skin tumour of ferrets  <cit> , but is in contrast with several reports in which sebaceous gland tumours as the most frequent cutaneous neoplasm .

in our caseload, the number of sebaceous epitheliomas was slightly higher than adenomas. both tumour types were characterized by squamous differentiation, and by areas of scc development in nine cases. the presence of squamous metaplasia has been previously reported in these tumours that have been defined as “basal cell tumour with sebaceous and squamous differentiation” and interpreted as putatively arising from pluripotential basal cells  <cit> . the occurrence of scc within sebaceous tumours has been previously reported in long-standing lesions in ferrets, but valid hypotheses able to explain this association are lacking  <cit> .

the prevalence of vascular cutaneous/subcutaneous neoplasms in our caseload parallels previous reports  <cit> . on the contrary, cutaneous neoplasms of smooth muscular origin were less common in this study  <cit> .

the lymphoid tissue was the third most commonly involved by neoplastic disease after endocrine tissues and skin/subcutis. most lymphomas were nodal, followed by lymphoma arising from the spleen and the gastrointestinal tract. the frequency of lymphoma was lower than what previously reported . in the united states, lymphoma has been hypothesized to have a viral etiology in ferrets . however, the agent has not been identified even if horizontal transmission of lymphoma using cell or cell free inoculation has been demonstrated, supporting this hypothesis . the different frequency of lymphoma in our caseload compared with ferrets from the u.s. could be related to a dissimilar distribution of this putative etiological agent. a further hypothesis may derive from the fact that, in veterinary practice, lymphomas are frequently diagnosed by cytology only; thus, the number of lymphomas in our caseload could be underestimated. similarly to what is reported in literature, hemangiosarcomas occurred more commonly in the liver, hemangiomas mainly in the skin, and rarely in thoracic and abdominal cavity, likely in association with serosal membranes  <cit> .

skeletal tumours consisted mainly of chordomas, and were located on the tail as previously reported  <cit> . on the contrary, osteosarcomas were rare and arose in the maxillary region rather than in the appendicular bones.

it is worth mentioning the high number of spindle cells tumours with vacuolated cells evidenced within the abdominal cavity, without connection to identifiable organs or tissues. no reports of these tumours seem to be available . the large size of these neoplasms can be explained by the lack of associated clinical signs, leading to a late diagnosis. in these abdominal tumours, the spindle cell component accounted for almost the 90% of the neoplasm, while the vacuolated component was minimal. the morphology of the polygonal neoplastic vacuolated cells strongly resembled adrenal cortical cells, suggesting a possible origin from ectopic adrenal tissue. the documented presence of a spindle cell component within certain adrenal neoplasms likely supports this hypothesis  <cit> , and has been considered both a normal stromal component of the tumours or part of the tumours itself  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the frequency and the tissue distribution of tumours recorded in this study paralleled previous findings, with some differences regarding the frequency of lymphoma, adrenal mesenchymal tumours and the type of cutaneous tumours. some tumours that are among the most common in other species, such as hemangiosarcoma, osteosarcoma and scc, seem to be uncommon in ferrets and to be characterized by distinctive predilection sites. the unusual association between scc and sebaceous gland neoplasms and the primary origin of intrabdominal spindle cell neoplasms grants further investigation.
