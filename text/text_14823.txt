BACKGROUND
aromatic compounds are among the most widespread dangerous pollutants  <cit> . petroleum and its derivatives are the main sources of aromatic molecules released into the environment. the aromatic hydrocarbon content of petroleum can range from about 20% to more than 40% , whereas the aromatic hydrocarbon content of gasoline and diesel oil is about 30% and 25%, respectively  <cit> .

novosphingobium sp. strain pp1y is a recently isolated marine α-proteobacterium that is able to grow on a surprisingly wide spectrum of pure mono-, poly- and heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and on complex mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons dissolved in paraffin oil phases including gasoline and especially diesel-oil which is an optimal growth substrate. moreover, pp1y can emulsify diesel-oil by producing small  regular biofilm-covered oil drops that have been described as spherical colonies harbouring a reservoir of growth substrates  <cit> .

strain pp1y belongs to the sphingomonadaceae family, which is characterized by the presence of glycosphingolipids in the outer membrane, instead of the more common lipopolysaccharides. this peculiarity renders the surface of their cells more hydrophobic than those of the other gram-negative strains and, has probably contributed to the development of the ability to degrade mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . moreover, many sphingomonadales harbour several  large conjugative plasmids, ranging in length from less than  <dig> kbp to more than  <dig> kbp  <cit> . thanks to these megaplasmids, several sphingomonadales have “collected” genes for the degradation of xenobiotics and continuously exchange them with other bacterial strains . interesting examples are novosphingobium aromaticivorans f <dig>  which uses alkyl-benzenes as the sole carbon and energy source  <cit> , novosphingobium pentaromativorans us6- <dig>  which degrades pahs with 3– <dig> aromatic rings  <cit> , novosphingobium sp. tya- <dig>  which simultaneously degrades bisphenol a and 4-alkylphenols  <cit> sphingomonas paucimobilis epa <dig>  which degrades several polycyclic compounds  <cit> , sphingomonas wittichii rw <dig>  which can grow using dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin  <cit> , sphingomonas sp. ttnp <dig> which uses alkylphenolic compounds as a source of carbon and energy  <cit>  and sphingobium chlorophenolicum l- <dig> which degrades pentachlorophenol  <cit> .

here, we report the analysis of the genome of novosphingobium sp. strain pp1y and its comparison with the genomes of n. aromaticivorans f <dig>   <cit>  and s. wittichii rw <dig>  <cit> , the closest genomes in terms of nucleotide sequence. this comparison has yielded insights into pp1y and its ability to encapsulate and degrade the aromatic fraction of fuel oils.

RESULTS
complete genome features and chromosomal architecture
pp1y genome sequence assembly produced four replicons classified according to their size, as we previously reported  <cit>  . because the coverage of “small” plasmid  sequences was, on average, about twice that of the other replicons, it is expected that spl is present as a two-copy object within each bacterial cell. at present, very few complete sequences of bacterial chromosomes and plasmids are available for organisms of the genus novosphingobium . these sequences have a similar g + c content , but pp1y appears to have the largest and most complex genomic organization of the genus.figure  <dig>

evaluation of the putative dna replication origins
dna replication was investigated by searching for the putative genome replication origins using a bioinformatic tool. this tool, orifinder  <cit> , locates predicted bacterial replication origins within each dna sequence by taking into account base composition asymmetry, distribution of dna-a boxes and the presence of genes frequently located close to the bacterial replication start . this tool revealed a putative type-iii replication origin on chr, around base  <dig>  where there is a region of base composition asymmetry containing three dna-a-boxes, close to the heme gene  and to a dna-a gene. differently, on mpl, lpl and spl replicons, orifinder failed to locate an acceptable putative replication origin, suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in dna replications origins. interestingly, a typical plasmid replication para/parb/pars cluster was found on each of these replicons, and mpl and lpl contain also a predicted plasmid replication repa gene close to the para/parb/pars cluster, but in a different orientation to those predicted on the n. aromaticivorans dsm  <dig> pnl <dig> and pnl <dig> plasmids.

on the spl plasmid. a complete protein killer gene system is also found, namely, an operon containing two genes that force the host bacteria to retain the plasmid  <cit> .

protein genes identified and their significance
the gene products encoded by the  <dig>  orfs were characterized by searching for sequence similarity with known bacterial proteins contained in various collections . about 94% of the orfs matched at least one protein stored in the uniref <dig> or kegg genes databases, although the fraction of matched sequences varies and is significantly lower for lpl and spl . it is noteworthy that about 20% of the orfs matched proteins annotated as “hypothetical”, “putative” or “uncharacterized”, and are thus classified as coding for “conserved hypothetical proteins”. when the same search was done against protein sequences stored in the cog database, the fraction of identified gene products was lower. in fact, most of the orfs coding for “conserved hypothetical proteins” did not show any similarity. about 6% of the orfs did not match any sequence stored in the three databases and are thus classified as coding for “hypothetical proteins”.figure  <dig>

an all-against-all comparison of the protein sequences encoded within each replicon was done using blast  <cit>  under very stringent conditions  to look for inter-duplicated genes. about 20% of orfs from mpl have a counterpart within the main chromosome , thereby indicating a partial genome duplication. the whole complement of protein-coding genes was also compared to the one encoded within other complete genomes and plasmids from bacteria of the sphingomonadaceae family . a number of orfs ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> , i.e. 45-50% of those encoded within chr in pp1y, have a counterpart in the main chromosome of the closest analysed bacterial species, the most similar gene set being that from n. aromaticivorans, putatively from the same genus. there is no clear evidence that the three smaller replicons are functionally equivalent to other known plasmids in terms of protein coding genes: many protein genes predicted within mpl appear to have counterparts in n. aromaticivorans, although only 20% of lpl orfs have a counterpart in the pnl <dig> plasmid , while others are in the pnl <dig> plasmid  and some are scattered along the main chromosome. half the spl-encoded proteins are encoded by the main chromosome in n. aromaticivorans. sphingobium japonicum <cit>  and pp1y share elements of comparable size, although the latter has an additional smaller chromosome. the two species have a 45% similarity within the main chromosome in terms of protein-encoding content, but diverge more extensively in the plasmids. a plasmid from s. japonicum ut <dig> plb <dig>  <cit> , which is involved in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation, is somewhat similar to spl .table  <dig>

the protein-coding genes identified in pp1y are compared with those of several genomes and plasmids.



to assign a putative biological function to protein-coding genes, they were classified, when possible, into cog functional categories based on the result of a blast search against cog genes. the predicted protein sequences were also analyzed with the kegg automatic annotation server kaas, which assigns a functional annotation to genes following a blast alignment against the manually curated kegg genes database  <cit>  . overall, the chr sequence of pp1y contains practically all the core metabolism genes; notably, a number of predicted transporters and transcription factors are present in mpl .

characterization of the pp1y genes involved in aromatic hydrocarbon degradation
the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons requires activation of the aromatic ring. this generally occurs by dihydroxylation of the aromatic ring catalyzed by pairs of monooxygenases or dioxygenases/dehydrogenases that constitute the upper pathways. ring activation is followed by ring cleavage catalyzed by specialized dioxygenases  that start the lower pathways. in the case of methylated aromatic compounds, the initial step can be a monooxygenation reaction of a methyl group followed by oxidation to carboxylate. these reactions can be catalyzed by soluble dioxygenases or by membrane monoxygenases related to xylene monooxygenase xylm. the arylcarboxylate eventually undergoes ring dihydroxylation and cleavage  <cit> . analysis of the pp1y genome revealed at least  <dig> orfs  that potentially code for the enzymes of both the upper  and lower  pathways.table  <dig>

afour orfs coding for ring hydroxylating dioxygenases and  <dig> orfs coding for extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases are duplicated, therefore, the genome of pp1y codes for  <dig> potential ring hydroxylating dioxygenases and  <dig> potential extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases.



no soluble multicomponent monooxygenase that resembled the well characterized methane monooxygenases and toluene/o-xylene monooxygenase  <cit>  was found in the present study. thirty-eight orfs, which were predicted to code for  <dig> different multicomponent aromatic hydroxylating dioxygenases  <cit> , were identified – a number clearly higher than in the closely related strains n. aromaticivorans f <dig> and n. pentaromativorans us6- <dig>  . ppiy has a close counterpart of each f <dig> dioxygenase: three of these are present in double copy with a 100% identity, which is indicative of a very recent duplication event; and four others have a 90-95% identity, which suggests a less recent duplication event followed by divergence. all duplicated orfs are closely related to seven orfs coding for hydroxylating dioxygenases found on plasmid pnl <dig> from strain f <dig>  indeed, replicon a of strain pp1y contains two copies of a region of plasmid pnl <dig> probably derived by multiple fusion/duplication events . six pp1y oxygenases from the megaplasmids  do not have homologues in strains f <dig> and us6- <dig> but are closely related to predicted oxygenases from strain rw <dig> , suggesting that strain pp1y combined the dioxygenase pools of strains f <dig> and rw <dig> and later expanded the pool by duplication events. this strategy enabled pp1y to expand the pathway for the degradation of naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes, and to degrade larger pahs. the predicted pathway is shown in additional file 1: figure s3b.figure  <dig>

two potential membrane monooxygenases are predicted in pp1y; they show a 96% identity with each other and a 71-75% identity with the sole membrane monooxygenase found in strain f <dig>  which suggests another recent event of gene duplication. the two pp1y monooxygenases  mainly differ in the substrate-binding region, possibly to allow different substrate specificity. no membrane monooxygenase is present in the genomes of sphingomonas sp. mm- <dig>  sphingobium japonicum ut <dig>  sphingobium chlorophenolicum l- <dig>  sphingobium sp. syk- <dig>  sphingobium wittichii rw <dig> or novosphingobium pentaromativorans us6- <dig>  this suggests that, also in this case, the pp1y enzymatic repertoire was expanded by horizontal gene transfer and duplication events.

ten potential orfs code for seven homomultimeric extradiol ring cleavage dioxygenases   <cit> , related to pseudomonas putida mt <dig> catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase . orf at15671/at <dig> codes for a putative classic catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase; homology modeling and substrate docking have an active site pocket slightly larger than the family benchmark p. putida mt <dig> catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase . at15599/at <dig> code for a putative dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, and mpl <dig> for a putative  <dig> -dihydroxybiphenyl- <dig> -dioxygenase. at <dig> is a divergent member of the extradiol dioxygenase family and no closely related sequence is present in the protein databases.

homology models of these three rcds are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the four rcds were cloned, expressed in escherichia coli and their cleavage activity was assayed on 3-methylcatechol,  <dig> -dihydroxybiphenyl , and 4-hydroxyoestradiol . the latter was used as analogue of dihydroxy pahs because these compounds are unstable, difficult to synthesize and not commercially available. the protein coded in at15599/at <dig> is a very versatile enzyme, able to cleave substrates with  <dig> to  <dig> rings . enzyme at <dig> is only active on polycyclic substrates, while mpl <dig> is active only on  <dig> -dhbp, as predicted. finally, at15671/at <dig> is very active on monocyclic catechols, even though its substrate specificity is wider than that of p. putida mt <dig> catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase. taken together, these four enzymes are able to cleave all classes of 3- and/or 4-substituted catechols in complex mixtures. the other three pp1y rcds, at <dig>  mpl <dig> and mpl4329/mpl <dig>  are poorly characterized. preliminary modelling studies suggest that they are dioxygenases specialized in cleaving catechols bearing substituents at positions  <dig>  and/or  <dig>  and/or  <dig> . therefore, these dioxygenases have a substrate specificity complementary to the four described above.table  <dig>

the neighbor-joining tree of rcds  shows a great heterogeneity among sphingomonads both in the number of potential rcds  and in the distribution of the proteins among the rcd subfamilies. only strains f <dig> and pp1y have at least one representative for each subfamily. this particular set of rcds could allow strain pp1y to metabolize complex mixtures of catechols deriving from the simultaneous oxidation of several mono- and polycyclic-aromatic hydrocarbons , which are the preferred substrates for growing this strain.

besides the seven homomultimeric estradiol rcds, the pp1y genome contains also four potential orfs for heterodimeric extradiol rcds that are able to cleave catechol rings bearing substituents with carboxylate groups like protocatechuate . the genome of strain pp1y contains several other orfs coding for hypothetical mono- and dioxygenases whose involvement in the degradation of xenobiotics is less clear. among these, cds at <dig> is particularly interesting as it codes for a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase. these oxygenases cleave different substrates, namely alkyl-sulphonates and fenoxy-acids, by catalyzing monooxygenation reactions of ch bonds adjacent to good leaving groups. interestingly, no sphingomonad contains a homologous enzyme. moreover, at <dig> is a member of a group of adjacent orfs coding for:  a hydroxylating dioxygenase  that is only distantly related to rw <dig> and f <dig> dioxygenases ;  a heterodimeric extradiol ring cleavage dioxygenase related to  <dig> -dihydroxybenzoate dioxygenases; and  a hypothetical acetamidase . this cluster of orfs is present in several distantly related strains including some beta and gamma proteobacteria, thus suggesting a horizontal gene transfer event. at present, nothing is known about the physiological role of this pathway, but its wide diffusion suggests a potentially important ecological role. the data related to additional file 1: figures s9–s <dig> are reported under “additional file 2: supplementary results and discussion”.

stress response genes and their functions
the pp1y genome contains several orfs potentially coding for the so-called resistance-nodulation-cell division -type efflux pumps  <cit>  that actively excrete toxic molecules, and have thus been implicated in the capacity of pp1y to grow in close contact with a diesel oil phase. -type efflux pumps are constituted by three subunits: the inner membrane, the outer membrane and the membrane fusion component. the pp1y genome contains eight potential orfs for the inner membrane subunit and even more for the other components , suggesting the possible formation of hybrid pumps. the evolutionary relationships among the inner membrane subunits are shown in additional file 1: figure s12a.

three pp1y rnd pumps belong to a subfamily of pumps specific for neutral molecules like aromatic hydrocarbons, acriflavine and other toxic aromatic molecules. the product of at <dig> is closely related to toluene resistance proteins and is very likely an aromatic hydrocarbon resistance protein. three pp1y rnd pumps belong to a subfamily specific for mono and divalent transition metals and are closely related to a set of rnds pumps from cupriavidus metallidurans ch <dig>  a benchmark among strains able to tolerate very high concentrations of transition metals  <cit> . the pp1y genome also contains eight potential orfs for p-type atpases , which are membrane atp-dependent efflux pumps specialized in the excretion of metal cations  <cit> . for comparison, c. metallidurans ch <dig> genome codes for  <dig> p-type atpases.

on the basis of these findings, we assayed the ability of pp1y to grow in liquid medium containing high concentrations of metal cations. figure  <dig> shows that pp1y can grow in the presence of millimolar concentrations of nickel , lead , copper  and zinc . at higher concentrations, the growth rate steeply decreases to zero . interestingly, all the metals increase the carbohydrates/proteins ratio with respect to the control culture, thus suggesting that modification of the cell envelope could contribute to resistance to metals. these results show that the ability of pp1y to tolerate heavy metals is comparable to that of heavy metal-tolerating strains like c. metallidurans ch <dig>  <cit> , which suggests that pp1y could play a role in the bioremediation of hydrocarbons in environments polluted by heavy metals.figure  <dig>

tellurite anion is highly toxic to microorganisms  thanks to its ability to catalyze the oxidation of cell thiols and produce radical oxygen species  <cit> . therefore, the wide diffusion of tellurite-resistance mechanisms among bacteria is not surprising, and they might include an aspecific increase of the radical scavenger systems and specific tellurite anion transporters  <cit> . the pp1y genome contains three orfs potentially coding for proteins belonging to three different tellurite-resistance mechanisms: tela , tehb  and terc from proteus mirabilis <cit> . due to the scarce knowledge about these systems, it is difficult to predict their role in tellurite resistance. however, all these orfs are located in a cluster of orfs coding for proteins probably involved in detoxification. interestingly, a similar cluster of orfs is present in the genome of strain rw <dig>  but not in other sphingomonads .

the importance of glutathione as a radical scavenger and mediator of detoxification systems varies among bacteria. however, several bacteria use glutathione and glutathione-dependent enzymes to detoxify reactive organic compounds , halogenated compounds or alkylhydroperoxides, and reactive oxygen species  such as oxygen radicals  <cit> .

in addition to genes involved in glutathione synthesis and in the reduction of oxidized glutathione, the pp1y genome codes for  <dig> glutathione s-transferases . this number is about double that of e. coli and suggests that glutathione could play an important role in detoxification of toxic diesel oil components and of toxic metabolites produced by the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons, like epoxides and ros.

the pp1y genome also codes for six members of a peculiar family of very small  monooxygenases known as “antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenases”  <cit> . these enzymes are the only known monooxygenases not containing any metal or flavin cofactors  <cit> , and that prevalently oxidize phenolic groups to quinines. they are involved in at least two very different physiological processes:  the synthesis of the polyketide antibiotics , and  the quinol redox cycle . in particular, e. coli ygin could prevent the accumulation of the semiquinone intermediate formed during the oxidation of quinols to quinones thus minimizing the formation of free radical species  <cit> . at least some of the six pp1y antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenases could have similar functions. however, some of them could be also involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites. it is noteworthy that pp1y is able to inhibit the growth of molds , which suggests it secretes antifungal compounds.

identification of genes involved in extracellular polymer secretion and biofilm formation
the analysis of the pp1y genome has revealed potential regulatory mechanisms  and secretion systems for extracellular polymers, including polysaccharides and poly-gamma-glutamate, which may play a role in the complex “social” behavior of pp1y, a strain able to form different types of multicellular amorphous aggregates and ordered biofilm . quorum sensing is a simple molecular mechanism that results in coordinated behavior in response to cell density  <cit> . the presence in pp1y of two qs systems is interesting since they could work simultaneously in response to two different cell densities or, could be activated alternatively under specific conditions. both possibilities could account for pp1y’s complex behavior.

although several orfs for sphingan synthesis have distantly related homologues in the pp1y genome , a gene cluster similar to those present in other sphingomonas does not exist in pp1y. therefore, it is unlikely that pp1y could produce a sphingan-like polysaccharide. however, several clusters potentially coding for the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides are distributed among the larger replicons , as shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  table s <dig> and figure s14a. lpl contains two regions that are probably involved in the synthesis of exopolysaccharides , and are widely distributed among sphingomonads. the closest sequences can be found in s. japonicum ut <dig> with an identity of 70-90% at protein level. interestingly, the region between these two couples of orfs in lpl contains five orfs coding for hypothetical glycosyl transferases and four orfs coding for the subunits of an abc-type polysaccharide transport system with high homology in several sphingomonads . lpl <dig> is particularly interesting as it codes for a large protein containing three glycosyl transferase-like domains. no other sphingomonad contains a representative of this subfamily of glycosyl transferases that can be found in distantly related bacteria, suggesting another case of horizontal gene transfer. taken together these findings suggest that lpl codes for the synthesis and export of one or more capsular polysaccharide that probably contains mannose and rhamnose, like sphingans, but whose structures could differ from those produced by other sphingomonads.

several biofilm-forming strains secrete cellulose as a matrix component. lpl from pp1y shares with sphingobium japonicum ut <dig> a cluster of orfs coding for a two-subunit cellulose synthase , which implicates lpl in both biofilm synthesis and remodelling. another cds coding for a hypothetical cellulase is located on chromosome  not far from a cds coding for an exo- <dig> / <dig> -beta-glucanase which could act downstream the cellulase  . interestingly, pp1y has the largest number of glycosyl hydrolases and glycosyl transferases among sphingomonadales and related groups of alpha proteobacteria .

the pp1y genome contains three orfs coding for γ-pga polymerases , which are involved in the synthesis of poly-gamma-glutamate, a strongly anionic homopolymer composed of glutamate residues linked by amide bonds between α-amino and γ-carboxyl groups  <cit> . this polymer can perform different functions, including the stabilization of the extracellular matrix, glutamate storage and toxic metals binding .

CONCLUSIONS
this analysis of the annotated novosphingobium sp. pp1y genome has revealed peculiar biochemical and biotechnological properties, namely, the metabolic pathways specifically involved in:  the degradation of a vocabulary of aromatic hydrocarbons,  the resistance to toxic compounds and  the qs social behavior mechanism. this detailed functional evaluation opens new translational perspectives regarding the possible manipulation of the pp1y genome for bioremediation purposes. moreover, the comparison between the enzymatic machinery of pp1y and those of the other sphingomonads able to degrade environmental pollutants suggests that each sphingomonad has independently evolved its own repertoire of degradative enzymes through a complex combination of vertical heredity, horizontal gene transfers, duplications and rearrangements. this process is still ongoing as demonstrated by the presence of multiple copies of pnl1-like regions at different locations of the pp1y chromosome. as a consequence, even closely related strains like pp1y, f <dig> and us6- <dig>  which belong to the genus novosphingobium, have unique features and adaptations to specific, also polluted, environments. the analysis reported in this paper strongly supports the general belief that sphingomonads are very adaptable bacteria with extraordinary genomic plasticity. it also raises biotechnological perspectives of using sphinomonads in bioremediation processes.
