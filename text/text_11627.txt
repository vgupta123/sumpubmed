BACKGROUND
lignin is, after cellulose, the second most abundant terrestrial biopolymer, accounting for approximately 30% of the organic carbon in the biosphere
 <cit> . the biodegradation of lignin plays a crucial role in the earth’s carbon cycle. unlike cellulose and hemicellulose, this amorphous and insoluble aromatic material lacks stereoregularity and is not susceptible to hydrolytic attack. in nature, the white-rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium is among the small group of fungi that can completely degrade lignin to carbon dioxide while leaving the crystalline cellulose untouched
 <cit> .

lignin degradation by p. chrysosporium is initiated by an array of extracellular oxidases and peroxidases, such as the multiple isoenzymes of lignin peroxidase  and manganese-dependent peroxidase 
 <cit> . both lip and mnp require extracellular h2o <dig> for their catalytic activity. one likely source of h2o <dig> is the copper radical oxidases, such as glyoxal oxidase
 <cit> . in addition to the copper radical oxidases, the fad-dependent extracellular aryl-alcohol oxidases  catalyze the oxidation of aryl-alcohol derivatives into their corresponding aldehydes with the concomitant reduction of o <dig> to h2o <dig> <cit> . the aaop substrates, like the physiologically-significant secondary metabolite  <dig> -dimethoxybenzyl  alcohol
 <cit> , can originate, firstly, through de novo biosynthesis
 <cit>  and secondly, through reduction of aromatic aldehydes released during lignin degradation in cyclic redox reactions involving also aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase 
 <cit> . furthermore, the identification of the veratryl alcohol binding site in lip
 <cit>  confirms the presumption that this alcohol also serves as a redox mediator for lip-catalyzed depolymerization of lignin
 <cit> .

by following the reduction of  <dig> -dimethoxybenzaldehyde  in nitrogen-limited cultures of p. chrysosporium, muheim et al. <cit>  purified an intracellular aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase  from this lignin-degrading fungus. a cdna coding for this protein was later isolated and characterized
 <cit> . however, the biochemical properties of the aadp enzyme were not extensively studied.

due to its high efficiency in lignin degradation, and to its potential applications in the textile, fuel and paper industries, the 35-mb haploid genome of p. chrysosporium strain rp <dig> has been sequenced
 <cit> . the current draft release, version  <dig> , includes a total of  <dig>  gene models
 <cit>  and reveals that the secreted oxidases, peroxidases and hydrolytic enzymes that cooperate in wood decay exist as large multi-gene families. taking advantage of this genome sequence, this work describes the cloning of an aad cdna and the comprehensive biochemical characterization of the encoded enzyme in order to get deeper insight into its biological relevance and biotechnological applications potential such as the degradation of aromatic inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydrolysates that strongly impair ethanol fermentation by yeast
 <cit> , as well as for the microbial production of natural flavour and fragrance molecules like 2-phenylethanol.

RESULTS
cloning of a cdna from phanerochaete chrysosporium encoding an aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase
using the amino acid sequence coded by a previously cloned aad orf from phanerochaete chrysosporium  strain ogc101
 <cit>  as query, a blast alignment was performed against the translated predicted orfs of the genome sequence of p. chrysosporium strain rp78
 <cit> . the results showed the existence of  <dig> aad homologues that consist of six to nine exons and encode proteins from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. the presence of multiple aad genes in the pc genome is in accordance with strong multiple bands observed in a southern blot by reiser et al. <cit> . interestingly, in scaffold_ <dig>  two tandem aad homologues  were found adjacent to each other. the distance between these two adjacent orfs is only  <dig> base-pairs. this extensive genetic diversity was also observed for other lignin-biodegradation related genes encoding peroxidases, oxidases, glycosydases and cytochrome p450s
 <cit> . the existence of multiple aad genes might suggest multiple specificities required to reduce various aryl-aldehydes arising from the catabolism of complex wood polymers. 

among the  <dig> predicted homologous orfs in the genome of pc strain rp <dig>  the one in scaffold_3:2235704– <dig>  has only  <dig> base pairs differences with the cdna previously cloned by reiser et al. <cit>  and encodes a 100% identical amino acid sequence. considering that the remaining  <dig> aad homologues show  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % amino acid identity with this cdna sequence, we designed specific primers on the coding region from scaffold_3:2235704– <dig>  to clone the full length cdna using race  and pcr techniques. the method was adopted because of the presence of  <dig> introns in the genomic sequence of this pc aad <dig> gene. the rna used for this cloning was obtained from a six days nitrogen-limited culture of pc strain bkm-f- <dig>  as shown in figure
 <dig>  qpcr assays under this growth condition showed that the aad <dig> transcript began to accumulate at day  <dig> and continued over  <dig> days. this result nicely correlated with an increase of aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase activity acting on veratraldehyde during n-limited culture and reaching a maximum after  <dig> days of growth
 <cit> . the race-pcr method on the 6-days purified rna allowed us to isolate a  <dig>  kilobase full-length cdna containing a  <dig> bp orf that encoded a protein 100% identical with the translated genomic sequence from pc rp <dig> strain
 <cit>  as well as with that of reiser et al. <cit> . the sequencing results of the cloned pc aad <dig> cdna also showed the presence of a 5′ untranslated region  and of a 3′ poly tail, confirming the integrity of the mrna template. comparison of the 5′utr  with that of the cdna by reiser et al. <cit>  revealed  <dig> % nucleotide identity, suggesting they are the same gene in the two strains.

heterologous expression in e. coli and purification of recombinant pc aad1p
in order to obtain large amounts of purified recombinant enzyme for biochemical characterization, the pc aad <dig> orf was cloned in pgs-21a and pgex-6p- <dig> vectors and expressed in e. coli to produce gst and/or his <dig> tagged proteins. the expression conditions were optimized using different e. coli strains, cultivation temperatures, iptg concentrations and induction times. the highest accumulation of recombinant pc aad1p was obtained with e. coli bl <dig> star™ strain harbouring the pgs-21a-aad <dig> expression vector after overnight induction with  <dig>  mm iptg at 16°c allowing the production of up to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g·l− <dig> of recombinant protein after purification. after cell disruption, the recombinant aad1p was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography to yield a single protein band as shown on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . this sds-page also showed that the recombinant protein was the major band in the cell lysate  and that the purified protein migrates at an apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda in our conditions of electrophoresis. taking into account the presence of the gst and his <dig> tags in the fusion protein, which correspond to ~  <dig> kda, the molecular mass of our purified pc aad1p is in accordance with the theoretical molecular mass calculated from its amino acid composition  and very close to the apparent  <dig> kda of the aad enzyme purified from p. chrysosporium by muheim et al. <cit> .

biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant pc aad1p
structure analysis of pc aad1p
we searched for functional domains of the pc aad <dig> protein using the pfam database server
 <cit> . this in silico analysis identified the protein as belonging to subfamily akr9a of the aldo-keto reductase  superfamily with residues d <dig>  y <dig> and k <dig> as predicted active- sites. the akr superfamily is one of the three enzyme superfamilies that perform oxidoreduction on a wide variety of natural and foreign substrates
 <cit> . the large akr superfamily includes presently  <dig> families, with more than  <dig> proteins identified in mammals, plants, fungi and bacteria. akr structures share a highly conserved 8-barrel motif, a conserved cofactor  binding site and catalytic tetrad, and a variable loop structure which usually defines broad substrate specificity. the majority of akrs are monomeric proteins of about  <dig> amino acids in length, although several members from families akr <dig>  akr <dig> and akr <dig> were found to form multimers
 <cit> . the closest akr protein ‘relatives’ of pc aad1p  are the fungal norsolorinic acid reductase from aspergillus flavus  and sterogmatocystin dehydrogenase from aspergillus nidulans  and the putative yeast proteins aad14p, aad3p, aad4p and aad10p from saccharomyces cerevisiae. according to the family tree structure, the nearest akr with 3d structure characterized is akr11c <dig> from the bacterium bacillus halodurans <cit> . aldo-keto reductases catalyze oxidation and reduction reactions on a range of substrates using nad as cofactor. an ordered bi bi kinetic mechanism, in which cofactor binds first and leaves last, has been demonstrated for pig kidney aldehyde reductase 
 <cit> , bovine kidney aldose reductase adr
 <cit> , rat liver 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
 <cit>  and 3-oxo-5b-steroid 4-dehydrogenase
 <cit> , and may be a characteristic feature of other akrs
 <cit> . the reduction reaction involves 4-pro-r hydride transfer from nadh to the substrate carbonyl and protonation of the oxygen by a residue of the enzyme acting as a general acid
 <cit> . the rate of this reaction is increased with substrates harbouring chemical structures that facilitate their nucleophilic attack by the hydride ion. it is also influenced by the orientation and/or relative mobility of the carbonyl function with respect of the rest of the molecule that would affect its protonation by one or more possibly acid residues of the active site.

temperature- and ph-dependence of pc aad1p activity
to determine ph and temperature optimum of the recombinant purified pc aad1p, we used veratraldehyde as substrate for the reductive sense, and the corresponding alcohol for the oxidative sense of the reaction, while nadp was used as the cofactor. as shown in figure
3a, the activity of this enzyme was optimal at about ph  <dig>  in the reductive sense whereas oxidation rates could only be measured in basic conditions with an optimum at ph  <dig> . at this ph, the oxidation activity was 7-fold lower than at the optimal ph for the reductive reaction. these results strongly support the fact that the pc aad1p works in the cells predominantly as an aldehyde reductase. the optimal temperature for activity was only determined in the reductive sense and was found to be close to 37°c .

substrate specificity and kinetic properties of pc aad1p
the substrate specificity of the purified recombinant pc aad1p protein was determined with a large spectrum of chemical molecules including linear aliphatic and aryl-aldehydes and alcohols, and ethyl-, ramified and aryl acetate esters , keeping in mind that the presence of a gst tag at the amino terminus could modify the enzyme properties. figure
 <dig> shows some of the aldehyde and alcohol substrates analyzed in this study ordered by chemical function and substitution. for comparative analysis, we carried out our assays at ph  <dig>  in  <dig> mm mes and at 30°c using the same concentration of substrate molecules and nadph and compared the measured activity to that obtained with veratraldehyde, which was used as the reference. the activity value with this substrate was set to 100%. as indicated in table
 <dig>  pc aad1p activity with mono-methoxylated benzaldehyde at positions  <dig>  or  <dig> , or dimethoxylated at positions  <dig>  was very close or even slightly higher than with veratraldehyde . activity was reduced by two when the methoxy radical was on carbon  <dig> . the presence of a hydroxyl group on benzaldehyde or on methoxy-substituted benzaldehyde resulted in a dramatic drop of the activity of pc aad1p. likewise, the enzyme was  <dig> to 5-fold less active on other types of substitutions of the benzaldehyde molecule such as with chlorine, fluorine or nitro functional groups. furthermore, the pc aad1p activity on phenylacetaldehyde was comparable to that of veratraldehyde. linear aldehydes of  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms were also assayed for substrate specificity of pc aad1p. the highest activity was observed on c <dig> to c <dig> aldehydes, with reaction rates about 2-fold lower than on veratraldehyde but comparable to that on benzaldehyde. no activity was detected for propanal  and butanal  and very low activity for c <dig> to c <dig> aldehydes.

results are the mean of three separate experiments with relative sem being lower than 6%.
 <dig> and
 <dig> 

among the substrates assayed for the oxidation reaction by pc aad1p with nadp+ as cofactor, the highest activity was by far that on veratryl alcohol , whereas other mono-, di- or tri-substituted methoxybenzyl alcohols showed poor reactivity with this enzyme. interestingly, the pc aad1p showed 46% activity on 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl alcohol  as compared to that on veratryl alcohol. no activity could be detected on many other linear aliphatic, ramified aliphatic or aryl alcohol substrates as well as on some acetate esterified aryl and ramified alcohols. altogether, these results suggest that a specific size, structure and conformation of the substrate are necessary to allow concurrent interactions of the carbonyl group of the substrate molecule with the cofactor and with key amino acids of the active site. other parameters like the relative hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of the substrates and of the active site as well as the possibility of resonance delocalization within a conjugated π system of the substrate might also account for relative specificity of the aad1p enzyme to its substrate.

we then obtained precise kinetic parameters of pc aad1p with respect to cofactor dependency and affinity to several substrates like veratraldehyde or veratryl alcohol . in the reductive sense, using  <dig>  mm veratraldehyde, the activity of pc aad1p for nadph oxidation followed a michaelis-menten curve with an apparent km =  <dig> μm. nadh could also be used as electron donor though exhibiting a lower affinity . the enzyme was only active with nadp+ in the oxidation sense of the reaction, with a km of  <dig> μm. moreover, the activity of this enzyme determined against veratraldehyde or veratryl alcohol using nadph or nadp+ as cofactor showed a slight inhibition at elevated concentration of substrate . however, the apparent km for veratraldehyde was 30-fold that for veratryl alcohol. this explained also that the catalytic efficiency kcat/km of pc aad1p was about 100-fold higher in the reductive than in oxidative sense of the reaction. reduction activity towards veratraldehyde has also been described for the enzymes adh6p and adh7p from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> .

nd: no detectable activity under the conditions of the assay.

ni: no inhibition detected.

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the cloning and biochemical properties of an aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase of the white-rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium. it also shows its wide spectrum of activity on various chemicals  such as linear aliphatic and aryl-aldehydes, as well as its preference to function in the reductive sense under physiological conditions. this enzyme can be considered in the design of metabolic engineering strategies/synthetic biology systems for biotechnological applications such as the degradation of aromatic inhibitors present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates that impair yeast fermentation, or the microbial production of natural flavours and fragrances like the rose-like flavour compound 2-phenylethanol. further studies on the crystal structure of the protein and the determination of the key amino acids in its active site would be extremely helpful for implementing protein engineering strategies in order to modify or improve the kinetic parameters of the enzyme.

analysis by qpcr of phanerochaete chrysosporium aad <dig> gene expression
the expression of pc aad <dig> during nitrogen-limited cultivation was analyzed by real-time pcr . the frozen mycelia were disrupted with tissuelyser ii grinder for  <dig> x  <dig>  min at  <dig> s− <dig> frequency  and total rna was purified from c.a.  <dig> mg wet-mycelium with the rneasy plant mini kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the quality of the extracted rna was determined using the bioanalyzer  <dig> with the rna  <dig> nano labchip kit  and quantified in the nanodrop nd- <dig> uv-visible light spectrophotometer . cdna was then synthesized from an exact amount of  <dig> μg total rna in  <dig> μl reaction mixtures using the iscript™ cdna synthesis kit . real-time pcr reactions were carried out using a myiq single-color real-time pcr detection system . the β-tubulin transcript coded by scaffold_10:459524– <dig> was amplified in parallel with the target aad <dig> cdna and used as reference for normalization of gene expression. the stable ct values observed for this gene among the different samples reflects the stability of its expression under the conditions tested. primer sequences were as follows: aad1-2-3-f <dig>  and aad1-3-4-r <dig>  for target gene pc aad1;x btub-n-term-f  and btub-n-term-r  for reference gene. reactions were performed in  <dig> μl final reaction volume using iq™ sybr® green supermix ,  <dig>  μm final concentration of each primer and  <dig> μl of the cdna preparation. the qpcr conditions were as follows:  <dig> cycle ,  <dig> cycles . reactions were set up in triplicate for each of four biological replicates to ensure the reliability of the results. the absence of genomic dna in rna samples was checked by real-time pcr before cdna synthesis. melting curves  were performed at the end of the qpcr reaction to verify the specificity of the amplification products and the absence of primer dimers.

race cloning of aad <dig> cdna from phanerochaete chrysosporium
the relative expression level of aad <dig> gene in p. chrysosporium being maximum after six days of cultivation in nitrogen-limited liquid medium, fungus pellets were harvested at this physiological state, filtered, washed twice with water and frozen in liquid nitrogen. the frozen mycelia were disrupted  <dig> x  <dig>  min at  <dig> s- <dig> frequency with tissuelyser ii grinder  and total rna was purified from c.a.  <dig> mg wet-mycelium with the rneasy plant mini kit . in order to clone the p. chrysosporium aad <dig> full-length cdna, 5′- rapid amplification of cdna ends  and 3′-race were performed with the smart™ race cdna amplification kit from clontech . after separate synthesis by reverse transcription, 5′- and 3′-race cdna fragments were amplified by touchdown pcr in independent reactions with the gene specific primers aad1-3-4-r <dig>  and aad1-2-3-f <dig> , respectively. touchdown pcr conditions were as follows:  <dig> cycles ,  <dig> cycles ; then  <dig> cycles . the resulting amplicons were cloned into pgem®-t easy vector . the full-length pc aad <dig> orf was obtained by overlapping pcr using phusion® high-fidelity dna polymerase , the 5′- and 3′race cloned fragments as templates and the aad1-orf-start-f  and aad1-orf-end-r  primers. thermal cycling conditions were:  <dig> cycle at 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s, 68°c for  <dig> s and 72°c for  <dig> min. the resulting pcr product was cloned into the pgem®-t easy vector . all pcr products were a-tailed before cloning into pgem®-t easy vector and transferring into chemically competent e. coli dh5Î± cells . the inserts were sequenced at beckman coulter genomics .

expression and purification of pc aad <dig> orf in escherichia coli
the full-length pc aad <dig> orf obtained by race cloning was amplified by phusion® dna polymerase pcr with primers bamhi-start-f  and noti-nostop-r in order to generate bamhi and noti sites  respectively at 5′ and 3′ of the aad <dig> orf and cloned in pgem®-t easy vector . pcr conditions were:  <dig> cycle ,  <dig> cycles ; then  <dig> cycle . insert was excised from vector by digestion with bamhi and noti and directionally subcloned into the expression vector pgs-21a  previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. the resulting construct, termed pgs-21a-aad <dig>  was sequenced to verify that the pcr reaction had not introduced any mutations. this expression plasmid encoded the recombinant fusion protein containing a his6-gst tag at the n-terminus and a his <dig> tag at the c-terminus.

three e. coli strains bl <dig> star™  , bl <dig> and bl21- codonplus-ril  were tested as expression hosts after transformation with plasmid pgs-21a-aad <dig>  overnight cultures of the transformants made in lb medium containing the appropriate antibiotic at 37°c were used to inoculate  <dig> ml of the same medium in  <dig> l erlenmeyer flasks at an initial od <dig> of  <dig> . the bacterial biomass was grown at 37°c and  <dig> rpm until od <dig>  <dig> – <dig> . the production of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  at  <dig>  mm final concentration followed by incubation at 16°c and  <dig> rpm for  <dig> h. bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation , resuspended in pbs buffer at ph  <dig>  containing  <dig> μg·ml- <dig> lysozyme and disrupted by sonication . after addition of triton® x- <dig> at 1%  final concentration, the cell lysate was left on ice for  <dig> min and centrifuged  to remove cell debris.

the recombinant pc aad1p fusion protein was purified by a single-step batch affinity chromatography process on glutathione sepharose™ 4b previously equilibrated with pbs buffer at ph  <dig>  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the glutathione sepharose™ 4b beads  were added to the cell lysate supernatant  and incubated  <dig> h at 4°c under gentle agitation  in  <dig> ml falcon™ conical tubes . non-adsorbed proteins were removed by washing the beads with pbs buffer at ph  <dig>  several times until the bradford assay for protein did not react any more. the recombinant protein was eluted with  <dig> mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig> mm reduced l-glutathione and stored at 4°c.

enzyme assays
enzymatic activity of pc aad1p was determined spectrophotometrically using an agilent hp  <dig> uv-visible spectrophotometer . unless otherwise specified, all assays were carried out at 30°c in  <dig> ml reaction mixtures using  <dig> cm optical path length microcuvettes. reactions were initiated by substrate addition and were monitored by recording the absorption at  <dig> nm. at this wavelength, the molar extinction coefficients of the substrate compounds could be considered as negligible  compared to that of nadh . the effect of ph was studied at 30°c, using  <dig> mm mes ,  <dig> mm hepes ,  <dig> mm tris–hcl  or  <dig> mm glycine-koh  as buffers. the temperature dependence was evaluated in  <dig> mm mes buffer  in the presence of  <dig>  mm  <dig> -dimethoxybenzaldehyde and  <dig>  mm nadph and the reaction was started by adding  <dig>  μg of the enzyme. the substrate specificity towards a range of substrates  and the kinetic parameters determinations  were determined in  <dig> mm mes buffer  using  <dig>  mm nadph and  <dig> mm substrate in the reduction sense, or in  <dig> mm glycine-koh buffer  using  <dig>  mm nadp+ and  <dig> mm substrate  for the oxidation sense. the specific activity towards  <dig> -dimethoxybenzaldehyde  and to  <dig> -dimethoxybenzyl alcohol  were taken as 100% for the reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively .

the kinetic parameters km, kcat and ki for aldehyde and alcohol substrates  were computed by fitting initial reaction rates, measured as a function of substrate concentration, to the michaelis-menten equation  or, when substrate inhibition was observed, to the uncompetitive substrate inhibition equation  with the non-linear regression enzyme kinetics  <dig>  module of the sigmaplot  <dig>  package :

  v=vmaxs/km+s 

  v=vmaxs/km+s+s2/ki 

where v represents the reaction rate, vmax is the limiting reaction rate, s is the substrate concentration, km is the michaelis constant and ki is the substrate inhibition constant. the catalytic constant kcat of the enzyme for the different substrates was derived from
kcat=vmax/e. the total enzyme concentration  was evaluated using a protein molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the enzyme kinetic parameters for nadh and nad+ + were determined with  <dig>  mm  <dig> -dimethoxybenzaldehyde and  <dig> mm  <dig> -dimethoxybenzyl alcohol, respectively. results are the mean ± sem from at least three separate experiments.
