BACKGROUND
cotton  is not only the world's most important fiber crop, but also an irreplaceable oil crop. the cotton fiber provides 85% of the farm gate value of the cotton crop, and the rest is made up by cottonseed, seed meal and seed oil . cottonseed oil represents a complementary product that can be used in foods or as a material for biodiesel production, with quality and price advantages over rapeseed oil and soybean oil. cottonseed oil, which makes up approximately 16% of the seed weight, is the most valuable product derived from cottonseed  <cit> . as a result, there has been a stable increase in the demand for cottonseed oil in the global market. at present, there are two main strategies to genetically improve cottonseed oil yields, i.e., traditional breeding to increase the proportion of oil in cottonseed and transgenic approaches to increase the quality and content of cottonseed oil. however, it is currently unknown if an improvement in cottonseed oil production can be achieved through manipulations of genes involved in plant oil biosynthesis.

plant oils are mainly composed of triacylglycerols , the main storage lipids. there are two pathways for tag biosynthesis in plants  <cit> . the first pathway is the de novo biosynthesis from glycerol-3-phosphate and acyl-coa occurs via the kennedy pathway, which involves three acyltransferases, i.e., glycerol-3-phosphate o-acyltransferase , lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase , and diacylglycerol acyltransferase   <cit> . in mammals, lpaats are identified as part of the 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate o -acyltransferase  family with lpaat  <dig> to  <dig> corresponding to agpat  <dig> to  <dig>  and lpaat ƞ to agpat  <dig>  <cit> . dgat belongs to the membrane-bound o-acyltransferase  family that includes four subfamilies in plants, i.e., mboat <dig>  dgat <dig>  lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase  or lysophospholipid acyltransferase , and homologs of saccharomyces cerevisiae glycerol uptake protein  . gpat, agpat, lpcat or mboat share common features in acyltransferase motifs, but their overall sequences are distinctly different  <cit> . the second pathway involves the conversion of lipid phosphatidylcholine  to diacylglycerol , in which, acyl-coas are redirected from pc via the activities of phospholipase c, choline phosphotransferase, and phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase   <cit> , or phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase   <cit> . an acyl group can be released from pc to generate lysophosphatidylcholine  by the reverse reaction of acyl-coa:lpc acyltransferase  <cit>  or by phospholipase a/acyl-coa synthase  <cit> .

phosphatidic acids  are a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of tags and the first acylation step catalyzed by gpat can be partly bypassed by dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase in some tissues and organisms. therefore, lpaats are vital to pa biosynthesis in catalyzing the incorporation of acyl groups into the sn- <dig> position of the glycerol backbone  <cit> . in higher plants, two pathways of lpaat catalysis control the metabolic flow of lysophosphatidate  into different pas in diverse tissues. pas are either dephosphorylated to form tags, or are used in the synthesis of phospholipids, which are important components of biological membranes. therefore, lpaats are crucial to the biosynthesis of membrane phospholipids and storage lipids in developing seeds. in fact, in higher plants, lpaats play an essential role in improving the fatty acid component of seeds by reducing the proportion of saturated fatty acids .

lpaats are thought to be among the most stringent acyltransferases in terms of substrate specificity . studies on the acyl specificity of lpaats in various plant species have shown that they have stronger affinity for 16– <dig> carbon monounsaturated fatty acids  than for sfas  <cit> . there are at least two classes of lpaat genes  in different plant species  <cit> . the characteristics of class a microsomal lpaats, as defined by frentzen  <cit> , are ubiquitously expressed throughout the plant, and their enzymes show specificity for 18:1-coa. these are typical features of enzymes that biosynthesize membrane glycerolipids. class b lpaats were first cloned and characterized from coconut   <cit> . in this subfamily, lpaat genes are generally expressed in seeds, and they encode enzymes with a strong substrate specificity towards unusual acyls, such as erucic acid  and lauric acid , consistent with the seed microsomal activities and oil composition of the above species. however, recent studies have indicated that the characteristics of b-class lpaats may differ in other species. for example, the b-class lpaats in castor  showed specificity for 18:1-oh  <cit> .

in a recent study, a rapeseed  lpaat was shown to be the rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the conversion of lysophosphatidate  to pa in the tag assembly process  <cit> . the expression of rapeseed lpaat genes in arabidopsis enhanced lpaat enzymatic activities, which redirected more acyl-coas from pc and relieved feedback inhibition of tag biosynthesis. also, the overexpression of lpaats increased seed oil content, thus reinforcing the utility of lpaat genes as valuable biotechnological tools. consequently, lpaat homologs have been cloned from poached eggplant   <cit> , a. thaliana  <cit> , rapeseed  <cit> , coconut  <cit> , corn   <cit> , indian cress   <cit> , java olives   <cit> , and castor  <cit> . the overexpression of a lpaat gene from the slcl- <dig> mutant yeast stain in a. thaliana and b. napus increased the incorporation of long-chain fatty acids into the sn- <dig> position of tags, leading to an increase in seed oil content by 8–48%  <cit> . however, thus far, no such a transgenic work has been performed using lpaat genes from cotton.

to date, little is known about the natural variation of the lpaat genes and their association with seed oil production in higher plants including cotton. furthermore, none of the genes encoding for these enzymes has been characterized in cotton; therefore, their role in increasing cottonseed oil content is unknown. in addition, since fatty acids are essential for membrane biosynthesis, saturated very-long-chain fatty acids were found to promote fiber cell elongation in cotton  <cit> . however, the relationship between natural genetic variation in lpaat genes and fiber development is also currently unknown. near-isogenic lines  or backcross inbred lines  with the same genetic background but differing in oil content, fiber initiation or elongation can provide important genetic stocks to investigate lpaat genes with relation to fiber development and seed oil content.

the genomic organization of the lpaat family has been mostly studied in only arabidopsis and castor, but not in other species including cotton. upland cotton  with higher yields and wider adaptations produces approximately 95% of the world cotton fibers and seed. another cultivated tetraploid, i.e., g. barbadense-ad <dig>  accounting for the remaining world cotton production, produces much longer, stronger and finer fibers with higher cottonseed oil content and lower protein content than upland cotton. therefore, bils developed from an interspecific crossing between the two species provide important genetic stocks to address if lpaats are associated with cottonseed oil content and fiber quality. the genomes of the two cultivated tetraploid cotton species were recently sequenced . it is commonly accepted that, like other three wild tetraploid cotton species including g. tomentosum-ad3
, g. mustelinum-ad <dig>  and g. darwinii-ad <dig>  both cultivated tetraploid species originated from a common ancestor of a natural hybrid between an extant diploid a-genome cotton  and a wild d genome  species  <cit> . in this study, we identified  <dig> lpaat genes in the two allotetraploid species, i.e., g. hirsutum and g. barbadense and their likely ancestral diploid species g. arboreum and g. raimondii whose genomes were sequenced earlier . after an in-silico analysis of the phylogeny, genomic organization and gene structure for the lpaat gene family, we then conducted a detailed analysis of transcription profiles of the lpaat gene family by analyzing information in two rna-seq datasets followed by a quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analysis. sequence variations within each gene were further evaluated for development of polymorphic markers and association analysis with cottonseed oil content and fiber quality traits. one of the lpaat genes with a sequence variation was used in a transgenic yeast study to confirm its effect on tags. the study represents one of the most comprehensive genomic approaches in plants that combine an in-silico bioinformatics analysis with transcriptomics at the rna level, snp identification and typing at the dna level and their associations with seed oil and fiber quality.

RESULTS
genome-wide identification of lpaat genes and phylogenetic analysis
the whole genome sequence scaffolds from the ancestral diploids g. raimondii , g. arboreum  and their descendant tetraploids g. hirsutum  and g. barbadense  were used for a genome-wide search for lpaat genes in gossypium. as a result, we identified  <dig> lpaats genes in the four genomes, including  <dig> gr_lpaats based on the sequence information of d <dig> reported by paterson et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> ga_lpaats in the draft a <dig> genome reported by li et al.  <cit> , and  <dig> and  <dig> lpaats on the a subgenome _lpaats) or the d subgenome _lpaats) in the draft ad <dig> genome  <cit>  and ad <dig> genome  <cit> , respectively. the further phylogenetic analysis of putative cotton lpaat proteins included some previously characterized plant acyltransferases . based on their predicted protein sequences, the lpaat genes were classified into four subfamilies; a-class lpaat  , lpaat4/ <dig> , b-class lpaat , and lpaat <dig>   . also, some close paralogous relatives of lpaats were identified in the four gossypium species.fig.  <dig> a phylogenetic tree of lpaats in four gossypium species. sequences of other lpaat genes and lpaat-related genes were downloaded from ncbi website. ● gossypium; ▼ three putative isoforms in gossypium

the lpaat2/ <dig> subfamily, also known as the a-class lpaat family, encodes microsomal lpaats that show a generalized expression pattern. this subfamily includes atlpaat <dig> from arabidopsis  <cit> . within the lpaat2/ <dig> subfamily, gr6lpaat <dig>  ga10lpaat <dig> and two copies of ghlpaat <dig> from tetraploid g. hirsutum  encoded proteins with a high level of similarity to the cacao tclpaat <dig> protein, and were identified as putative orthologs from different genomes or subgenomes, i.e., homoelogs . interestingly, three putative lpaat2/ <dig> isoforms were identified in gossypium. these three lpaat isoforms appeared to have incomplete conserved domains . specifically, ga4lpaat <dig> and at-gh1lpaat <dig> had only one lpaat-characteristic box iii   <cit> , a motif that is well conserved among proteins with the Φfvegtr consensus sequence in the lpaat2/ <dig> subfamily. gr4lpaat <dig> had boxes iii and iv , but an imprecise vliprtkg consensus sequence. the sequence around box i  was quite similar among the lpaat2/ <dig> proteins, conforming to the consensus sequence nhxsdidwl, where x usually indicates an arginine  residue  <cit> . however, this consensus sequence was different  in gr7lpaat <dig>  the same held true for sequences around box ii , where there was a well-conserved eylfler motif in most members of the cotton lpaat2/ <dig> subfamily , with an exception of gr7lpaat <dig> having a different sequence . the consensus sequences of boxes iii and iv were conserved among all of the lpaat2/ <dig> proteins.

twelve lpaats were clustered into the lpaat4/ <dig> subfamily which was a closely related sister group with lpaat2/ <dig> , although there were some sequence differences around various lpaat boxes. for example, there was an aspartic acid  residue near box i in the lpaat2/ <dig> subfamily, but a glutamic acid  residue near box i in the lpaat4/ <dig> subfamily. this variation may explain why these sequences were grouped into two subfamilies.

six gossypium gene sequences designated as a paralogous lpaat group clustered together in the b-class lpaat subfamily, which encodes lpaats that are usually, but not always, seed-specific and shows substrate specificities for unusual acyl groups  <cit> . as the sister group to the b-class subfamily the lpaat <dig>  subfamily contained eleven lpaats in two paralogous groups from two different branches. the lpaat <dig>  subfamily includes atlpaat <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit>  . a close relationship between b-class lpaats and plastidial lpaats was revealed in the phylogenetic analysis, consistent with the results of a previous report  <cit> . the b-class lpaats and the plastidial lpaats shared the same conserved motif  around box iii, except for ga4lpaatb which lacked box iii .

in plants and other organisms, lpaat activities have been detected in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> , plasma membrane  <cit> , and mitochondria  <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes their predicted subcellular localizations of the putative lpaat proteins in cotton, together with information on the predicted length, molecular weight , and isoelectric point . each lpaat subfamily was predicted to a specific subcellular location. for example, within the a-class lpaat  subfamily,  <dig> % of the lpaat proteins were predicted to localize in the endoplasmic reticulum; and lpaat4/ <dig>  b-class lpaats, and lpaat <dig>  were predicted to be in the plasma membrane, the mitochondrial inner membrane, and the plasma membrane, respectively .

structure and domain analysis of putative lpaat genes in sequenced diploid and tetraploid gossypium genomes
we used the gff  files of the four gossypium species to analyze the exon–intron structure of putative lpaat genes. figure  <dig> shows the exon–intron structure of each subfamily. the number and location of introns varied among subfamilies, but there were some common features. in the a-class subfamily, eight deduced genes included  <dig> exons, but the locations of introns differed. at-gh1lpaat <dig>  ga4lpaat <dig> and gr4lpaat <dig> were closely related to lpaat <dig>  but had only nine, six and five exons, respectively. within this subfamily, homoelogous lpaats had the same structure, such as dt-gh9lpaat <dig>  gr6lpaat <dig>  at-gh9lpaat <dig> and ga10lpaat <dig>  members of the lpaat4/ <dig> subfamily had three exons, except for ga5lpaat <dig> and dt-gb13lpaat <dig> which had four and two exons, respectively. these similarities in gene structure were also observed among members of the b-class and lpaat <dig>  groups . the results of the domain analysis indicated the presence of a highly conserved lplat_lclat1-like domain in the a-class and lpaat4/ <dig> lpaats, and an lplat_agpat-like domain in the b-class and plastidial lpaats . in conclusion, members belonging to the same subfamilies of the phylogenetic tree had a similar gene structure and conserved motif, consistent with the results of the phylogenetic analysis.fig.  <dig> genetic structures of lpaat genes in four gossypium species. black boxes show exons and lines show introns




chromosomal distribution of lpaat genes on gossypium genomes
after integrating chromosomes of the sequenced cotton genomes excluding g. barbadense as its lpaat genes were not physically well mapped, we found that the lpaat family members were distributed unevenly among chromosomes. among the candidate lpaat genes, eight grlpaats were located in six d <dig> chromosomes , and nine galpaats to seven a <dig> chromosomes  . because there are many syntenic gene blocks between the chromosomes of g. raimondii and g. arboreum, the dotted lines in additional file 4: figure s <dig> link homoelogous lpaats between a <dig> and d <dig> chromosomes, but the chromosomes linked may not be homoelogous between genes from the two subgenomes of the tetraploid species. for g. barbadense, three gblpaats matched to the at subgenome, and seven gblpaats matched to the dt subgenome . for g. hirsutum, five ghlpaats were on the dt subgenome, and eight ghlpaats on the at subgenome .fig.  <dig> co-localisation analysis of lpaat genes with seed oil and protein quantitative trait loci . red color shows lpaat genes and underlines indicate the lpaat genes co-localisation with seed oil and protein qtl




analysis of transcript levels of ghlpaat genes in two rna-seq databases of tetraploid upland cotton
to reveal a general pattern of gene expression for the lpaat genes identified, we analyzed the transcript profiles of lpaat genes in two rna-seq datasets: one with transcriptomic information for two upland bils, i.e., nmga- <dig> vs. nmga- <dig> , with differing fiber lengths but similar seed oil content, and the other containing transcriptomic information for upland xuzhou  <dig> vs. its fiberless and fuzzless mutant xuzhou 142 fl   <cit>  which differed in fiber initiation and cottonseed oil content  <cit> . the transcript abundances of all the  <dig> putative lpaat genes were determined at the fiber initiation stage  and the elongation stage . of the  <dig> genes in the sequenced g. hirsutum genome, two  was not expressed. the other  <dig> genes were transcribed at both stages of fiber development and in all tissues represented in the two rna-seq datasets. based on the rna-seq data of the two bils, the transcript levels of the a-class lpaat genes were higher than those of the genes in the other three subfamilies in both genotypes. interestingly, the transcript levels of dt-gh9lpaat <dig> and at-gh9lpaat <dig> were similar in maintaining a high expression level at three different stages, but the at-gh1lpaat <dig> had a low level of expression at  <dig> dpa fibers ovules, with the highest level observed in  <dig> dpa ovules in both genotypes . there was no significant difference in expression levels between the two bil genotypes differing in fiber length but with similar seed oil content.fig.  <dig> transcript profiles of lpaat genes in gossypium hirsutum. a a heat map showing transcript levels of  <dig> lpaat genes in ovules at three stages  in two bils. b transcript levels of  <dig> lpaat genes in − <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa ovules of xuzhou  <dig> and xuzhou 142 fl. color scale above dendrogram shows relative transcript levels. "l" and "s" indicate long fiber length line nmga- <dig> and short fiber length line nmga- <dig>  respectively. "wt" and "fl" indicate xuzhou  <dig> and its xuzhou 142 fl mutant, respectively




similar patterns were observed in the other rna-seq dataset for xuzhou  <dig> and its fiberless and fuzzless mutant xuzhou 142 fl. the exception was that at-gh13lpaat <dig> showed higher transcript levels in xuzhou  <dig> and xuzhou 142 fl than in the other two bils due to different genetic backgrounds . the results indicate that the expression of lpaat genes at the transcription level is not involved in the natural variation of fiber length between upland and g. barbadense and fiber initiation as controlled by the genes in xuzhou 142 fl.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis of transcript profiles of eight ghlpaat genes
due to a high homology for genes within the same subfamily, we chose eight of the above eleven expressed lpaat genes in upland cotton that have homologs with its ancestral diploid species g. raimondii and g. arboreum to design gene-specific primers  for a further evaluation of the transcript levels. the eight genes included two a-class genes, two lpaat4/ <dig> genes, three plastidial lpaat genes, and one b-class gene. using qrt-pcr analyses, we further analyzed the gene transcript levels in roots, stems, leaves, petals, ovules, and fibers of xuzhou  <dig> and the xuzhou 142 fl. we analyzed ovules at different developmental stages, i.e., − <dig>  − <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa , and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa  as cottonseed oil accumulates rapidly in ovules after 15– <dig> dpa. the results showed that the eight lpaat genes were expressed in all the organs and tissues tested throughout the plant. however, seven lpaat genes  showed the highest transcript levels in  <dig> dpa fibers. at-gh6lpaat <dig>  at-gh1lpaat <dig>  at-gh1lpaat <dig>  at-gh13lpaat <dig> and dt-gh1lpaatb were expressed preferentially at the late period of ovule development in xuzhou 142 fl, especially at  <dig> dpa. the transcript profiles of the two a-class genes were similar; however, in the lpaat4/ <dig> subfamily, dt-gh6lpaat <dig> and at-gh13lpaat <dig> showed an opposite trend in their transcription patterns. at − <dig> to  <dig> dpa ovules  and  <dig> dpa fibers , dt-gh6lpaat <dig> showed very low transcript levels, while at-gh13lpaat <dig> was highly expressed . moreover, dt-gh6lpaat <dig> showed very high transcript levels, but at-gh13lpaat <dig> had a low level of expression at 15– <dig> dpa fibers. in the b-class subfamily, dt-gh1lpaatb did not show a seed-specific expression pattern as expected, because it was also expressed in all of the other organs .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of eight lpaat genes in xuzhou  <dig> and xuzhou 142 fl. y-axis, relative expression levels. x-axis, days post anthesis. fibers and ovules were not separated at − <dig>  − <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa. 10 f, 15 f, 20 f, 25 f dpa and 10o, 15o, 20o, and 25o dpa indicate fibers and ovules, respectively, at different stages. error bars show standard deviation  calculated from three replications




co-localisation of lpaat genes with quantitative trait loci  for seed oil and protein contents
to analyse if any of the ghlpaats is genetically associated with cottonseed oil content, a co-localisation analysis of ghlpaats with quantitative trait loci  for seed oil and protein contents was performed. we first downloaded qtl for these two traits from two types of genetic populations, i.e., intraspecific g. hirsutum and interspecific g. hirsutum × g. barbadense populations  <cit> . as a result,  <dig> ghlpaats on five pairs of homeologous chromosomes were located within a 25 cm region of cottonseed oil or protein qtl, including at-gh1lpaat <dig> on chromosome a01/c <dig>  at-gh5lpaat <dig> on a05/c <dig>  at-gh6lpaat <dig> and at-gh6lpaat <dig> on a06/c <dig>  at-gh9lpaat <dig> on a09/c <dig>  dt-gh1lpaatb on d01/c <dig>  dt-gh13lpaat <dig> on d13/c <dig>  dt-gh5lpaat <dig> on d05/c <dig>  dt-gh9lpaat <dig> on d09/c <dig>  and dt-gh6lpaat <dig> on d06/c <dig> except for at-gh13lpaat <dig> on a13/c <dig> . interestingly, the respective cottonseed oil or protein qtl co-localised lappt genes on six chromosomes belong to three pairs of the homeologous chromosomes, i.e., lpaat <dig> on a <dig> and d <dig>  lpaat <dig> on a <dig> and d <dig>  and lpaat <dig> on a <dig> and d <dig>  while other two pairs of homeologous chromosomes  carry cottonseed oil or protein qtl but with different lpaat genes. these co-localised qtl include five qtl  from the upland population only and five  from both upland and interspecific populations . however, since a 25-cm chromosomal region may contain several hundred genes  <cit> , the co-localisation of a seed oil qtl with a lpaat gene may not indicate a causative relationship between the natural variation of the lpaat gene and seed oil content .

sequence variation of lpaat genes and its association with fiber quality and seed oil and protein contents
sequence variations in the predicted genes between the sequenced g. hirsutum  and g. barbadense  were further analyzed. the results showed that most of the sequence variations were detected between homeologous genes from the a- and d- subgenomes, while only a few single nucleotide polymorphisms  were predicted in homologous genes between the two cultivated species or between 3- <dig> and xinhai  <dig> within g. barbadense . the results imply that the differences in seed oil and protein contents and fiber quality traits between the two species are unlikely related to the natural sequence variations in the lpaat genes, which is verified by the following correlation analysis between lpaat gene markers and the seed and fiber quality traits.

the above rna-seq datasets were further used to identify snps in the lpaat genes within upland cotton. in comparison with the sequenced tm- <dig> genome, we identified  <dig> snps in the cdna sequences of seven lpaat genes in the nmga- <dig> and nmga- <dig> dataset and  <dig> snps in five lpaat genes in the xuzhou  <dig> and xuzhou 142 fl dataset . however, as expected, most of the sequence differences were between tm- <dig> and the pair of the two bils in the sg  <dig> background or the nils in the xuzhou  <dig> background . only eight snps between nmga- <dig> and nmga- <dig> bils were detected in five lpaat genes . between xuzhou  <dig> and xuzhou 142 fl nils, eight snps were identified in four lpaat genes, confirming the non-near-isogenic status of the two genotypes used in this study, which was recently reported by ma et al.  <cit> .

for an association analysis between the existence of snps in the lpaat genes  and cottonseed oil and protein contents and fiber traits, primers were designed to amplify fragments containing these snps using single strand conformation polymorphisms , which were used to screen the bil population of  <dig> lines derived from a backcross between upland sg  <dig> and g. barbadense giza  <dig>  as a result, one polymorphic sscp marker was developed from a pair of primers  designed for at-gh13lpaat <dig>  named at-gh13lpaat5- <dig> . a transition, a/g , was located in the 342th nucleotide of at-gh13lpaat <dig> , but the mutation appears to be synonymous with no change in amino acid. to examine the relationship of the sscp marker with seed oil and protein contents and fiber traits, a correlation analysis was performed in the bil population of  <dig> lines tested in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the marker was found to be significantly associated with both seed oil and protein content in the bils tested in  <dig>  the correlation between the presence of the sscp marker and seed oil content was significantly negative  and significantly positive with seed protein content  . the results indicated that the presence of the snp allele reduced cottonseed oil and increased protein content. since seed oil and protein contents are negatively correlated , which was also reported by others  <cit> , the opposite effects of the marker on seed oil and protein contents are expected. moreover, the sscp marker had a negative correlation with only one fiber quality trait, i.e., fiber uniformity  . however, the above results obtained in  <dig> were not confirmed by the results from the same bil population tested in  <dig> and  <dig>  as no significant correlations were detected between the snp and seed oil and protein contents or fiber quality . therefore, the inconsistent association between the marker of this lpaat gene and seed oil and protein contents or fiber quality indicates that the natural variation of this lpaat gene may not affect seed oil and protein synthesis or fiber development, but more studies are needed. overall, our results indicated that sequence variations in most if not all of the lpaat genes are not associated with the natural variation  for seed oil content or fiber quality in cotton.table  <dig> the correlation coefficients between the marker at-gh13lpaat5- <dig> developed from the lpaat gene and seed oil and protein contents and fiber quality traits in the backcross inbred line population of sg 747 × giza  <dig> hybrid tested in  <dig>   <dig> and 2009

content of tag and fatty acids in at-gh13lpaat <dig> transgenic yeast strains
because at-gh13lpaat <dig> is not located within the qtl region for the cottonseed oil and protein qtl on chromosome a13/c <dig>  and the snp detected in this gene was synonymous with no change in amino acid, the detected correlation between the snp and cottonseed oil and protein content in the bil population tested in  <dig> should not be causative. to validate the hypothesis that both gene alleles producing polypeptides of the same sequence have the same effect on oil biosynthesis, we compared the effect of the at-gh13lpaat <dig> gene from the upland, g. hirsutum  and g. barbadense  sources on oil synthesis in transgenic yeasts. a full length cdna with an 1119-bp open reading frame  from both sources was cloned into the yeast expression vector ppic <dig>  k and transformed into yeasts by licl. the gc/ms analysis determined six major fatty acids in the transgenic yeasts , i.e., palmitic acid , hexadecenoic acid , stearic acid , oleic acid , linoleic acid  and α-linolenic acid  . the analysis of fatty acid composition revealed that the expression of at-gh13lpaat <dig> in the yeast led to an approximately 25–31% increase in palmitic acid  and oleic acid  when compared to the non-transgenic control strains , and no significant differences were detected between the transgenic yeasts with genes from the upland and g. barbadense sources. as compared to the empty vector transformants, the total tags in the transgenic strains were also increased within the range of 16–29%, and transgenic yeasts with genes from both sources also showed similar results. the qrt-pcr analysis showed that the gene expression pattern was essentially similar to the concentration of tags among the three transgenic yeast strains tested . these results indicate that expression of the foreign gene at-gh13lpaat <dig> in the yeast can enhance oil content and selectively incorporate fatty acids into tags, and the gene alleles from both the upland and g. barbadense sources has a similar effort.fig.  <dig> content of tag and fatty acids in at-gh13lpaat <dig> transgenic yeast strains. a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry chromatogram of fatty acids from transgenic yeasts. b the content of fatty acids in transgenic yeasts.

the results of this study revealed details of  <dig> lpaat genes in the multigene family in four gossypium species with sequenced genomes: diploids g. raimondii and g. arboreum, and their descendant tetraploids g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. the translated protein sequences were clustered into four groups , consistent with other previous reports  <cit> . consistent with previous studies that whole genome duplication events occurred during the evolution of gossypium  <cit> , we observed that each grlpaat gene or galpaat gene in each of the diploid species corresponded to two ghlpaat genes in the tetraploid cotton belonging to one homeologous lpaat group. the eleven putative plastidial lpaats in cotton showed a high similarity to the previously characterized phospholipid/glycerol acyltransferase family proteins from coconut. proteins in the a-class lpaat  group, the b-class lpaat group, and the plastidial lpaat group were shown to have lpaat activity  <cit> . however, in arabidopsis, members of the lpaat4/ <dig> subfamily did not show lpaat activity in vitro  <cit> .

in this study, at-gh1lpaatb, dt-gh1lpaatb, at-gb1lpaatb, dt-gb1lpaatb, ga4lpaatb, and gr2lpaatb, were predicted to be in the b-class lpaat group in cotton. previous reports suggested that the b-class proteins are seed-specific isoenzymes, such as ldlpaatb and cnlpaatb isolated from poached eggplant and coconut, respectively  <cit> . however, recent studies have shown that b-class proteins are not restricted to plant seeds. rclpaatb  identified in castor, was shown to express at similar levels in other tissues/organs of the plant  <cit> . we obtained a similar result in that there were very low transcript levels of b-class lpaats in ovules based on our rna-seq analyses. this is possibly because the rna-seq data were obtained at the fiber initiation stage, and not the seed oil accumulation stage. the qrt-pcr results showed that dt-gh1lpaatb did not show a typical b-class expression pattern, but was expressed throughout the plant.

expression of lpaat genes and their natural variations in relation to seed oil content and fiber development
in higher plants, lpaats catalyze the incorporation of acyl groups into the sn- <dig> position of lpas to yield pas, the key intermediates in the synthesis of membrane phospholipids or tag storage lipids  <cit> . each cotton fiber is a single cell that can be used as a biological model to study cell expansion. during the rapid polarized expansion of the fiber cell, abundant membrane phospholipids are required to synthesize the cytomembrane so that the fiber cell can elongate from  <dig> to 15 mm at 5– <dig> dpa to 25–30 mm at  <dig> dpa. cottonseed oil accumulates later in ovules after 15– <dig> dpa. therefore, in developing cottonseeds, lpaats maybe play a dual role in that they produce raw materials for the biosynthesis of the membrane as the cell elongates and also catalyze the conversion of lpas to tags. to test this hypothesis, we analyzed lpaats in xuzhou  <dig> and xuzhou 142 fl, which have a similar genetic background based on the origin of the mutant. xuzhou 142 fl, the natural fuzzless-lintless mutant from the fibered wild type xuzhou  <dig> with both lint and fuzz, not only has few or no fibers, but also has higher seed oil content than that of xuzhou  <dig>  <cit> .

the qrt-pcr results revealed different expression patterns of lpaat genes, even those in the same subfamily. these findings suggested that lpaat genes have diverse developmental expressions. based on their expression patterns, the lpaats were grouped into two categories. the first category  showed high expression levels at two significant phases, i.e., during the rapid phase of fiber elongation  in xuzhou  <dig> and at the beginning of fatty acid accumulation in ovules of xuzhou 142 fl . at  <dig> dpa, fiber cells require membrane phospholipids to form new membranes. it is possible that these genes were preferentially expressed during membrane biosynthesis in cotton. interestingly, these genes showed a sharp increase in transcript levels in the  <dig> dpa xuzhou 142 fl ovules, but slower increases in transcript levels in xuzhou  <dig> at  <dig> dpa ovules and during other stages of xuzhou 142 fl ovule development. this may be because the fuzzless/lintless mutant xuzhou 142 fl seed has few or no fibers, and therefore, does not require large amounts of membrane phospholipids for new cytomembranes of fiber development. in that case, the lpaats would synthesize tags for seed oil production, rather than membrane phospholipids for developing fibers. the second group of genes  was expressed preferentially in fiber tissues, especially dt-gh6lpaat <dig>  their expression levels were very low in ovules of both xuzhou  <dig> and xuzhou 142 fl. this result suggested that these three lpaats in this group may be specific to membrane biosynthesis, but more studies are needed. however, it should also be pointed out that, the expression magnitudes at the rna level might not necessarily reflect the expression of these genes at the enzymatic level. in this study, the expression patterns of the lpaat genes between the two genotypes were overall similar, and no snps of lpaats identified and developed from a comparison between the two lines were located within the two gene regions for the fiberless and fuzzless traits  <cit> . we therefore conclude that none of the lpaat genes was directly involved with the fiberless and fuzzless mutation and its higher oil content in xuzhou 142 fl. therefore, a segregating population between the two genotypes is unnecessary to address the role of lpaats in the molecular mechanism of the fiberless and fuzzless trait in this mutant.

to further test if lpaat genes are related to cotton fiber elongation, a pair of bils with different fiber length and similar seed oil content was used. our results indicated that the expression levels of lpaat genes were similar between the two lines, suggesting that the genetic differences in fiber elongation between the two nils are not associated with the expression of lpaat genes. furthermore, a physical mapping of lpaat genes with qtl for cottonseed oil content showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> lpaat genes were located within qtl regions  for seed oil or protein content. however, to further test if lpaat genes are genetically related to cottonseed oil production and fiber quality traits, a backcross inbred line population  of  <dig> lines differing in fiber quality traits and seed oil content and fiber quality were used. the results indicated that, of all the potential snps identified in the lpaat genes, only one marker from one gene at-gh13lpaat <dig> showed a significant correlation with cottonseed oil content and fiber uniformity in only one of the three field tests, suggesting that sequence differences in most if not all of the lpaat genes are not involved in the natural genetic variation for seed oil production and fiber quality traits in cotton.

furthermore, we designed an experiment to see if the two lpaat variants of the same gene conferred by a snp  had a similar effect on oil content and composition in a yeast system. both variants were supposed to produce the protein with the same sequence and therefore a similar biochemical activity. as expected, the transgenic yeast experiment showed that the total tag and palmitic acid and oleic acid increased compared to the nontransgenic yeast control, similar to these obtained in other transgenic plant studies  <cit> . the results further showed that both sources of the at-gh13lpaat <dig> gene had a similar effect, proving the lack of association between the natural variation of the lpaat gene and fatty acid content and composition.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> lpaat genes were identified and grouped into four distinct subfamilies in four gossypium species, i.e., i.e., tetraploid g. hirsutum- ad1 and g. barbadense- ad <dig> and its ancestral diploids g. raimondii- d <dig> and g. arboreum- a <dig>  the detailed analysis of the sequence variation, qtl co-localisation and content of tag in transgenic yeasts showed that natural sequence variations in the lpaat genes are highly limited which are unlikely associated with the natural variations in seed oil and protein contents and fiber quality traits in cotton. however, the cotton lpaats can increase oil composition and content as demonstrated in the transgenic yeast experiment. the results provide an important lead for further studies to elucidate the involvement of lpaat genes in the natural variation of cottonseed oil content and a possible strategy in genetic engineering for the improvement of seed oil content and composition in cotton.
