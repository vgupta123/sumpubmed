BACKGROUND
legionella pneumophila is the etiologic agent of legionnaires' disease, an atypical pneumonia, which is often fatal if not treated promptly. however, it is principally an environmental bacterium that inhabits fresh water reservoirs worldwide where it parasitizes within free-living protozoa but also survives in biofilms  <cit> . since l. pneumophila does not spread from person-to-person, humans have been inconsequential for the evolution of this pathogen. instead, the virulence strategies of l. pneumophila have been shaped by selective pressures in aquatic ecosystems. indeed, the co-evolution of l. pneumophila with fresh-water amoebae is reflected in its genome sequence. the analysis of two l. pneumophila genomes identified the presence of an unexpected high number and variety of eukaryotic-like proteins and proteins containing motifs mainly found in eukaryotes  <cit> . these proteins were predicted to interfere in different steps of the infectious cycle by mimicking functions of eukaryotic proteins  <cit> . for several of these eukaryotic like proteins it has been shown recently that they are secreted effectors that help l. pneumophila to subvert host functions to allow intracellular replication  <cit> . the possibility that l. pneumophila has acquired at least some of these genes through horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes has been suggested by two studies  <cit> .

plasticity is another specific feature of the l. pneumophila genomes as integrative plasmids, putative conjugation elements and genomic islands were identified. in addition to dna interchange between different bacterial genera and even domains of life, horizontal gene transfer within the genus legionella and within the species l. pneumophila has been reported. for example a 65-kb pathogenicity island described first in l. pneumophila strain philadelphia  <cit>  is present in several l. pneumophila strains and also in other legionella species like l. anisa  <cit> . another example is the particular lipopolysaccharide cluster of serogroup  <dig> strains that has been detected in l. pneumophila strains of different lineages and genetic backgrounds  <cit> . l. pneumophila has all necessary features for incorporating foreign dna, as these bacteria are naturally competent and possess an intact recombination machinery  <cit> . these findings suggest that the l. pneumophila genomes are very dynamic and one would expect that horizontal gene transfer and recombination events play an important role in their evolution.

however, different analyses like early studies applying multilocus enzyme electrophoreses  supported a clonal population structure of l. pneumophila  <cit> . two recent reports using genetic profiling based on six or three genetic loci, respectively concluded also that l. pneumophila shows a clonal populations structure  <cit>  although the presence of few recombination events was not ruled out. later the analysis of the dota, mip and rpob genes in different isolates suggested for the first time that recombination may play some role in l. pneumophila evolution  <cit>  and a more in depth analysis using over  <dig> loci suggested that recombination events might be more frequent than was previously thought  <cit> . however, comparisons of these studies are difficult due to different sampling and different analysis methods used. furthermore there may be a bias associated with some of the genes selected in these studies like intergenic spacer regions or genes under positive selection that may lead to artefactual effects in detecting recombination. to solve these problem efforts have been undertaken recently to homogenize the results obtained for different species to allow comparisons  <cit> . these authors report for l. pneumophila a low recombination rate like for the obligate pathogens bordetella pertussis or bartonella henselae. in contrast coscolla and colleagues suggest a more important role for recombination at the intergenic level  <cit> .

these different results and the fact that a globally distributed l. pneumophila clone implicated in legionnaires' disease has been described  <cit>  may suggest that the role of recombination is not relevant. however, the description of clonal complexes is not incompatible with high recombination rates. transient clones may appear within a recombining population  <cit> , in particular if clones with high disease prevalence appear, as this seems to be the case for some l. pneumophila strains. these clones are often vastly over-sampled due to their clinical importance and show strong clonality. thus, this may be correct for this subgroup, but it may not be representative for the population. indeed when analyzing over  <dig> clinical and environmental l. pneumophila strains, significantly less diversity was found among the clinical isolates  <cit> .

in this study we investigated the genome dynamics and evolution of the species l. pneumophila by analyzing horizontal gene transfer, mobile genetic elements and recombination on a genome-wide level. we undertook this analysis based on six complete genome sequences four of which are the previously published reference genomes of l. pneumophila paris, lens  <cit> , corby  <cit>  and philadelphia  <cit>  and two that were sequenced in this study. the newly sequenced strains were selected according to epidemiological features that might be reflected in their genomes and should thus allow to study genome dynamics with respect to virulence. strain lorraine is rarely isolated from the environment but its prevalence in human disease is increasing considerably in the last years  <cit> . in contrast, l. pneumophila strain hl  <dig>  <dig> has been frequently isolated from a hospital water system since over  <dig> years but has never caused disease. analysis of these six strains identified a highly conserved and syntenic core genome and a diverse accessory genome. furthermore, it showed that recombination events and horizontal gene transfer are frequent in l. pneumophila. horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes as well as recombination between strains were identified suggesting that l. pneumophila genomes are highly dynamic, a feature allowing different clones to evolve into predominant disease clones and others to replace them subsequently within relatively short periods of time.

RESULTS
the l. pneumophila core genome comprises over  <dig> conserved genes that are highly syntenic
to get comprehensive insight into the genetic basis, evolution and genome dynamics of l. pneumophila sg <dig>  the strains responsible for over 90% of disease worldwide, we analyzed six completely sequenced genomes. the strains selected are all of sg <dig>  have endemic and/or epidemic character  were isolated in different countries  and in different years. two strains were newly sequenced for this study , the other four l. pneumophila genomes  have been published previously  <cit> . the genomes of l. pneumophila lorraine and hl  <dig>  <dig> consist each of a single circular chromosome of  <dig>  mb. strain lorraine also contains a plasmid. as shown in table  <dig>  the main features of the six l. pneumophila genomes analyzed , are highly conserved. the core genome of the six l. pneumophila genomes comprises  <dig> genes, which represents about 80% of the predicted genes in each genome. furthermore, the gene order is highly conserved as the  <dig> kb inversion in strain lens with respect to the other strains is the only exception. when comparing the strains two by two, in average 90% of the genes are present in both strains . however, when determining the non-orthologous genes specific of each genome and not present in the remaining  <dig> strains, each strain contains between  <dig>  and  <dig>  strain specific genes mainly encoded on mobile genetic elements. taken together, the l. pneumophila genomes have a highly conserved and syntenic backbone and a highly dynamic accessory genome of about  <dig> genes each mainly formed by mobile genetic elements, genomic islands and genes of unknown function. the complete annotation of these six genomes is available in a new data base resource that we have set up, legionellascope https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope/about/collabprojects.php?p_id =  <dig> and at the institut pasteur, legiolist http://genolist.pasteur.fr/legiolist/.

the species l. pneumophila has a highly conserved core genome
a) most eukaryotic like proteins are conserved in all l. pneumophila genomes
the presence of proteins with high similarity to eukaryotic proteins or proteins with domains preferentially or only present in eukaryotic genomes are a particular feature of l. pneumophila  <cit> . however, the criteria for identifying these proteins were never clearly defined. to analyze their evolution and possible origin in depth we have thus developed an automatic and systematic method to identify eukaryotic like proteins according to defined criteria. previously we had identified eukaryotic like proteins in l. pneumophila as proteins with the highest similarity score to eukaryotic proteins according to blast results, or by identifying eukaryotic domains  <cit> . however, due to constantly growing databases blast results are changing. furthermore, recent analyses of amoeba-associated bacteria, in particular symbionts of amoeba have shown that they also contain eukaryotic like proteins, suggesting multiple origins of these proteins in prokaryotes  <cit> . to get a more complete picture of eukaryotic like proteins of l. pneumophila and also to include those proteins that might have been transferred independently to different amoeba associated bacteria we defined a eukaryotic like protein as i) a protein having a better normalized blast score against eukaryotic sequences than against prokaryotic ones and ii) a protein that did not show blast results against neither legionella spp. nor other bacterial species for which resistance to amoeba infection has been demonstrated . applying these criteria we identified  <dig> proteins with putative eukaryotic origin, of which  <dig> are described here for the first time . given the fact that these proteins were probably acquired by hgt one would expect high diversity in the repertoire. however, our analyses revealed a considerable conservation as more than 50%  are conserved in all six l. pneumophila strains, indicating an ancient transfer. furthermore, they show 89-99% nucleotide identity, probably due to high selection pressure for their maintenance. thus most of these proteins belong to the core genome, indicating that their acquisition has taken place before the speciation of l. pneumophila. these  <dig> proteins might have allowed a common legionella ancestor to colonize an intracellular niche or to adapt better to the intercellular environment of a specific protozoan species leading to the evolution of the species l. pneumophila. interestingly,  <dig> of these  <dig> proteins are also conserved in l. longbeachae, which might thus be those indispensible for intracellular replication of legionellae   <cit> .

b) eukaryotic protein motifs are highly conserved among the l. pneumophila genomes
a second class of eukaryotic proteins of l. pneumophila is carrying domains predominantly present in eukaryotic proteins. to systematically identify these proteins we used the interpro database comprising  <dig> different domain search programs  <cit> . this allowed to identify the l. pneumophila proteins carrying eukaryotic domains in the newly sequenced strains lorraine and hl  <dig>  <dig> as well as to identify previously not reported motifs. similarly to the above described eukaryotic like proteins over half of the eukaryotic domain coding proteins are conserved in all six genomes and over 80% are conserved when two genomes are compared . moreover half of them share very high nucleotide identity of in average 98%-100%  again suggesting high selection pressure to maintain them.

our approach identified also new eukaryotic domains like spectrin repeats. the spectrin repeat forms a three-helix bundle and was reported primarily in the animal kingdom  <cit> . these repeats act as modules building long, extended molecules that also serve as a docking surface for cytoskeletal and signal transduction proteins. in l. pneumophila it is present in up to eight proteins of each strain  and all spectrin repeat proteins are predicted to be secreted dot/icm substrates  <cit> . another interesting domain is the ras gef domain that is present in two proteins encoded by strain paris one of which  is conserved in the six strains analyzed. ras-gefs are small gtpases typically present in eukaryotes that are involved in numerous cellular processes like gene expression, cytoskeleton re-organization, microtubule organization and vesicular and nuclear transport  <cit> . gefs  regulate rabs, gtp-binding proteins with conserved functions in membrane trafficking  <cit> . interestingly, according to the pfam database ras-gef domains in bacteria are only present in legionella, parachlamydia acanthamoebae and protochlamydia amoebophila, all of which are amoeba-associated bacteria.

coiled-coil domains have been identified previously in the l. pneumophila genomes as this motif can be found in all kingdoms of life. however extended coiled-coil domains are largely absent from bacterial genomes but are typical for archaea and eukaryotes. we thus searched the l. pneumophila genomes and  <dig> other genomes of bacterial pathogens or bacteria present in the aquatic environment  for proteins with five or more coiled coil domains. interestingly, legionella spp, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa contain the highest percentage of proteins with extended coiled-coil domains  compared to the number of predicted proteins encoded in their genome and only p. aeruginosa and l. pneumophila encode proteins containing more than  <dig> coiled-coil domains . most of these legionella proteins are predicted substrates of the dot/icm secretion system  <cit> . this suggests that large coiled-coil domains are specific adaptations to the eukaryotic cell probably implicated in interactions with host proteins.

c) high selection pressure acts on the dot/icm t4ss and its substrates
central to the pathogenesis of l. pneumophila are the dot/icm loci, which together direct assembly of a type iv secretion apparatus  <cit> . although all l. pneumophila strains investigated to date contain the complete dot/icm loci, sequence variations among the dot/icm genes among different l. pneumophila strains have been reported  <cit> . the dot/icm loci of the six strains analyzed here exhibited a very high nucleotide conservation of 98-100% among orthologs except for dota, icmx and for icmc of strain corby that is shorter and more divergent  as compared to icmc of strain paris. these results indicate that strong negative selection acts on these genes .

id, identity

since the identification of ralf  <cit> , numerous approaches have been used to identify dot/icm translocated substrates. currently  <dig> proteins of l. pneumophila have been described as being transloctaed by the dot/icm t4ss system  <cit> . analysis of their distribution among the six l. pneumophila strains reveals a very high conservation, as  <dig> of the  <dig> substrates are present in all six strains. nearly all of them show a nucleotide similarity of 95-100% and only nine are specific to strain philadelphia . furthermore, only  <dig> of the  <dig> substrates of strain philadelphia are missing in strain paris,  <dig> in strain lorraine or  <dig> in strain hl  <dig>  <dig> . thus, although high redundancy seems to be present in the repertoire of dot/icm effectors, the strong conservation of nearly all of them in all genomes, argues for their mutual importance for the l. pneumophila life cycle,

rare exceptions are ralf and ankb/lpp <dig>  the nucleotide sequence of ralf of strain philadelphia is only 85% similar to the ralf genes of the other strains and is  <dig> nts  shorter. a similar situation is seen for lpg2144/ankb that is  <dig> nts  longer in strain philadelphia and lens than in strain paris and corby. this is surprising, as the c-terminal region of ankb of strain philadelphia contains a eukaryotic prenylation caax motif mediating posttranslational modification of effector proteins, important for intracellular replication of l. pneumophila. lipidation facilitates the localization of this effector protein to host organelles and serves as a docking platform for ubiquitinated proteins  <cit> . thus in strain paris and corby other proteins might take over this function. taken together, this analysis suggests that over  <dig> of the dot/icm substrates of l. pneumophila have been present or have been acquired before the speciation and that such a large repertoire of effectors is indeed necessary for intracellular replication and adaptation to the specific protozoan hosts.

the species l. pneumophila has a highly dynamic accessory genome
a) a wide variety of t4asss and conjugative elements contribute to genome plasticity
based on sequence comparisons, t4sss are categorized according to their similarity to the a. tumefaciens virb/d <dig> system into type iva  and type ivb secretion systems  <cit> . t4asss resemble the virb/d <dig> system of a. tumefaciens, whereas t4bss proteins are more distantly related to the virb/d <dig> proteins  <cit> . t4sss are involved in effector translocation, horizontal dna transfer to other bacteria and eukaryotic cells, in dna uptake from or release into the extracellular milieu or in the spread of conjugative plasmids  <cit> . genome sequence analyses suggest that for l. pneumophila t4sss play an important role for adaptation and virulence as each genome encodes several t4asss in addition to the essential t4bss dot/icm discussed above. we identified in each strain either f-type or p-type t4asss or both. figures  <dig> and figure  <dig> show the organization of the structural genes encoding these systems, their organization and their localization . the f-type t4asss are all predicted to encode a complete t4ss core as well as the essential gene products for pilus assembly and mating pair stabilization that appears to be involved in dna transfer. they show homology and colinearity with the tra-region of the e. coli f plasmid  <cit>  and with the recently described tra region of rickettsia belii  <cit> . in l. pneumophila strain philadelphia  and l. longbeachae strain nsw , where the system has a chromosomal localization, it is inserted in a trna gene and flanking repeats are present as well as a gene coding for an integrase, suggesting that these t4sss are mobile . furthermore, comparison of amino acid identities revealed that the tra- region on the l. pneumophila strain paris plasmid  shows much higher identity with the tra region located on the l. longbeachae plasmid  than with those of the different l. pneumophila strains  . thus these systems seem to be transferred horizontally via plasmids but are also able to integrate in the genome similar to what was reported for the lvh-region  <cit> .

the f-type t4ss encode long, flexible pili that allow donors to mate in liquid and on solid media with equal efficiencies  <cit> . in contrast p-type t4ss like described in p. aeuroginosa encode short and rigid conjugative pili that allow surface mating. homologues to this system are also present in the legionella genomes. they were initially described in two genomic islands of l. pneumophila strain corby   <cit> . we show here that they are also present in the chromosomes of l. pneumophila strain lorraine  and l. longbeachae nsw <dig>  . again for all t4ss regions flanking repeats are found suggesting mobility, and protein identity values and gc-content values of the tra-trb genes are higher than the genomic average , supporting again horizontal and not vertical transmission.

another intriguing feature of these regions is that several transposases and phage related proteins are present in each of the tra clusters as well as genes coding for homologues of a putative phage repressor protein  and for homologues of lvra, lvrb and lvrc, first described for the lvh region of l. pneumophila. lvrc is a homologue of csra, a protein crucial for the regulation of the switch between replicative and transmissive phase of l. pneumophila  <cit> . it is tempting to assume that these csra homologues are implicated in the regulation of the mobility of these islands. possibly, dependent on the growth phase and/or on metabolic cues l. pneumophila might excise these islands as multiple copies could be advantageous in certain conditions, or perhaps allow high frequencies of dna transfer leading to fast and efficient adaptation to new conditions. the genomic features of these islands suggest a particular mechanism of mobility, which will be interesting to investigate.

b) the l. pneumophila genomes encode systems specific for protection against invading dna and stabilization of large genomic fragments
bacteria have developed multiple methods of protection against mobile genetic elements or bacteriophages. an example for acquired phage specific immunity is clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  loci  <cit> . another type of protection may be conferred by toxin-antitoxin  systems. bacterial ta systems are small genetic modules composed of a toxin and antitoxin. while toxins are always proteins, antitoxins are either rnas  or proteins   <cit> . these systems were first described for being dedicated to plasmid maintenance. several lines of research indicate that chromosomal ta systems might serve as protection against mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and phages. however, recent studies have shown that type ii systems are also involved in the stabilization of large genomic fragments and of integrative conjugative elements  <cit> . interestingly, type ii ta systems are thought itself to be part of the mobilome and to move from one genome to another through horizontal gene transfer  <cit> .

genome analyses identified several ta and crispr systems. interestingly, we identified only type ii ta systems of which all except two are in a chromosomal location . however, of the  <dig> chromosomal encoded ta systems identified at least  <dig> are located on putative genomic islands or mobile genetic elements. the two most frequently found ta systems in the l. pneumophila genomes are homologues of the higab and releb systems. higab was first described in the vibrio cholerae superintegron where it encodes mrna cleaving enzymes and can stabilize plasmids  <cit> . releb was shown, when introduced into the e. coli chromosome to prevent deletion of flanking dna and thus to diminish large scale genome reduction  <cit> . the same function was shown for the pared system of vibrio vulinificus, homologues of which are also present in one of the l. pneumophila genomes . thus, the different l. pneumophila ta systems might be important for stabilization of plasmids and integrative conjugative elements and for protection against invasion of plasmids, phages, or other mobile genetic elements.

*ta systems located on putative genomic islands; in parenthesis length of the corresponding protein

the crispr/cas system was shown to provide resistance against invading viruses and plasmids and has been identified in many bacteria and archea  <cit> . crispr/cas loci are also present in the l. pneumophila genomes of strains paris, lens, alcoy and  <dig> b but are absent from strains hl <dig> and lorraine. according to the cas genes, the crispr locus of paris is closely related to that of strain  <dig> b. in contrast the one of strain lens located on the plasmid is closely related to the chromosomal crispr locus of strain alcoy as previously described  <cit> . strain lens carries a second crisr locus on the chromosome; however, it does not seem to be functional like the one encoded by strain alcoy. probably strong protection against invading phages is not extremely important, as not all l. pneumophila strains contain crispr loci. this may be related to their intracellular life style or that despite their widespread occurrence in aquatic environments only few bacteriophages that specifically infect legionella seem to exist  <cit> .

c) accessory genome of strains lorraine and hl  <dig> 1035
in order to get insight in the genetic basis of the two newly sequenced strains, possibly implicated in their different disease frequencies  we analyzed the specific gene content of each of these strains more in depth. strain hl  <dig>  <dig> contains  <dig> and strain lorraine  <dig> genes without homology to any gene of the other five l. pneumophila strains sequenced of which the majority  code for proteins of unknown function . among the genes in these two genomes that lack an ortholog in the other sequenced l. pneumophila genomes, about 50% are clustered on three large genomic islands. one genomic island  of  <dig> kb spans from lpv <dig> to lpv <dig>  it is bordered by a met trna gene and encodes a phage related integrase. a second putative mobile element  of  <dig> kbs contains the region from lpv <dig> to lpv <dig>  it is bordered at one side by an integrase and a reverse transcriptase  and on the other side by a prophage rac integrase and a phage excisionase. strain lorraine contains also a large genomic island  of  <dig> kb that spans from lpo <dig> to lpo <dig>  it is inserted in a met trna gene, contains a phage related integrase and flanking repeats of  <dig> nts. additional, smaller genomic islands seem to be present, however, their borders are difficult to define. thus most of the strain specific genes seem to be acquired by hgt through mobility of genomic islands.

only for few of the specific genes a putative function can be predicted like genes coding for proteins involved in sugar and nucleotide metabolism, for uridine diphosphoglucuronate 5'-epimerase or for an udp-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. furthermore a specific ank motif containing protein and a leucine reach repeat protein are present in strain hl  <dig>  <dig>  in strain lorraine we identified mainly specific metabolic enzymes like a putative flavanone 3-dioxygenase, an enzyme involved in flavonoids metabolism and in biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, which are secondary metabolites of plants and algae. in addition, lpo <dig> is predicted to encode a kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase, an enzyme that is part of the tryptophan metabolism and lpo <dig> codes for a putative glycolate oxidase that catalyses the conversion of glycolate and oxygen to glyoxylate and hydrogen proxide. lpo <dig> codes a homologue of csbd, a general stress response protein of bacillus subtilis  <cit> . however, the best blastp hit is with the protochlamydia amoebophila homologue, an acanthamoeba sp. symbiont  <cit> . probably this gene has been acquired by hgt between these two bacteria within their amoeba host. quite surprisingly, we identified a gene coding a putative methyl-accepting chemotaxis sensory transducer  although all l. pneumophila strains analyzed to date do not encode chemotaxis systems. this gene shares  <dig> % amino acid identity with llo <dig> of l. longbeachae a protein that is part of its chemotaxis system  <cit>  also present in l. drancourtii  <cit> . probably a common ancestor encoded a chemotaxis system that was lost in l. pneumophila through a deletion and degradation process.

d) shared genome of the epidemic strains paris and lorraine
a search for genes shared by the two endemic strains but absent in all other strains identified only three genes that fulfilled these criteria and for which a function could be predicted. these encode the alpha, beta and gamma subunits of a putative thiocyanate hydrolase . most interestingly, these strains are both common in france and strain paris is also world-wide distributed  <cit>  suggesting a better niche adaptation. indeed, thiocyanate compounds are used for cleaning water circuits and these strains are thus probably able to better resist these treatments  <cit> . furthermore, strain alcoy that is responsible for several outbreaks and many cases of legionnaires' disease in spain, also contains these genes  <cit> . the genes coding the putative thiocyanate hydrolase have a gc content of 41-43%, which is significantly higher than the average g+c content of the l. pneumophila genome, which is 38%. when searching for the closest homologues according to blast searches we identified them in the genomes of rhodococcus opacus strain b <dig> and nocardia farcinica spp. these two are high g+c gram-positive bacteria belonging to the actinomycetales, which are phylogenetically not closely related to legionella suggesting that l. pneumophila acquired these genes by horizontal gene transfer.

taken together, the analysis of the accessory gene content showed again that l. pneumophila genomes show high plasticity due to mobile genetic elements and hgt. no specific virulence related genes explaining their different disease frequencies have been identified. however, the identification of a specific thiocyanate hydrolase might explain the wide distribution of strains paris and lorraine as it may allow them to better adapted to artificial water systems.

evolutionary genomics
phylogenetic reconstruction reveals extensive recombination
to analyze the relationship among the six different l. pneumophila strains a phylogenetic reconstruction was done based on a multilocus sequence  approach using  <dig> genes selected according to zeigler  <cit>  . these  <dig> genes were chosen as they had been shown to be powerful for predicting the relatedness of bacterial genomes  <cit> . the phylogeny obtained from their concatenated alignment showed a well-resolved topology with bootstrap values over 50%. to ascertain the reliability of the obtained phylogenetic tree we established individual phylogenies for each of the  <dig> genes. surprisingly, the incongruence among several gene trees was high. in addition the consense program results did not support any node to at least 50%. to further investigate these results we undertook a second analysis using a shimodaira-hasegawa test and compared the topologies of the individual alignments of each gene and the concatenated alignment of the  <dig> genes. as shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> the likelihood-based sh test for alternative tree topologies identified striking discordances. a possible explanation for the identified incongruences among the phylogenies obtained in our study is the presence of recombination events.

a with respect to strain paris, nts nucleotides

with the aim to explore whether recombination events are present in the selected genes we undertook an in depth analysis using the program rdp  <cit> . indeed, the analysis of individual genes identified intragenic recombination in  <dig> of the  <dig> genes . numerous additional recombination events were detected with the concatenated alignment of the  <dig> genes for which no intragenic recombination had been shown . to minimize false positive recombination events only those that were supported by at least two of the six methods used in rdp were taken into account. however, except one, all were supported by at least three methods. no artifacts resulting of positive selection should be included in this analysis since all of the genes are either informational or operational . most interestingly, four of the genes in which intragenic recombination was detected are housekeeping genes . housekeeping genes allow to estimate the extent of recombination within bacterial species since presence of recombination in such "normally recombination free genes" is indicative of a high rate of recombination  <cit> . similarly antigen-coding genes of legionella were reported to show recombination events  <cit>  and certain other genomic regions  <cit> . another example of intragenic recombination in l. pneumophila is the rtxa gene that contains a long tandem repeated domain of variable copy number and sequence  <cit> . rtxa of strain lorraine and corby share the same repeats, whereas the other strains have unique types of repeats. however, when including the newly sequenced strains lorraine and hl  <dig>  <dig> we found that repeats of the same type are shared by hl  <dig>  <dig> and philadelphia and by lorraine and lens , further substantiating high intragenic recombination among strains.

ns = non significant result. yes = significant result with p-value ≤ <dig>  .

to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the species l. pneumophila we used thus the concatenated alignment of the  <dig> genes described above. it gave a topology with high bootstrap support, however recombination bias may result in high support for the wrong tree. to avoid possible bias we thus analyzed the concatenated alignment of the  <dig> genes using a split tree decomposition that allows a more realistic representation of the phylogenetic relationships. furthermore we constructed a classical bifurcating tree using the highest possible number of genes . as shown in figure  <dig> the splits decomposition phylogeny is network-like suggesting incompatible partitions within sequence data, which commonly arise from recombination. although the phylogeny based on the orthologous genes can also be affected by recombination, the high number of informative sites included in this data set, should allow recovering the correct history of the species as it has been shown previously for other closely related bacterial species  <cit> .

taken together, in contrast to previous studies, which reported that the species l. pneumophila is a clonal population  <cit>  our results show clearly that a high recombination rate shapes the l. pneumophila genomes. this finding is in line with the natural competence of l. pneumophila. however, some worldwide distributed l. pneumophila clones have been described , suggesting that l. pneumophila is able to develop a unique genetic population structure within a particular region or environment as reported recently  <cit> .

recombination of large chromosomal regions of over  <dig> kbs among l. pneumophila strains
our recombination analysis revealed not only intragenic recombination events but also intergenic recombination as recombination was detected when using the entire alignment even with only recombination free genes . this finding may be explained by the recombination of fragments encompassing several genes or multiple recombination events involving smaller tracts along the genome. to test this hypothesis we used a method recently developed for the analysis of streptococcus agalactiae genomes  <cit> . in order to identify patterns of recombination, nucleotide substitutions between strains were counted in sliding windows across the previously defined core chromosome representing  <dig> possible pair wise comparisons. each pair wise comparison revealed highly conserved regions  and less-conserved regions , suggesting the occurrence of recombinational exchanges. when analyzing the different strains in depth we identified in each genome several regions with very low polymorphisms  suggesting that dna exchange of these fragments has occurred between the different l. pneumophila strains. most interestingly, the two french strains paris and hl  <dig>  <dig> that are present since several years in france show  <dig> regions of a size between  <dig> and  <dig> kbs that have very low polymorphism and thus seem to have been exchanged between them . in contrast when comparing strain lens with the other  <dig> genomes analyzed here, very few regions with low polymorphism, two with strain hl  <dig>  <dig> and one with strain lorraine, were detected. furthermore, no dna exchanges seem to have occurred with strains corby, philadelphia or paris. this indicates that strains that are frequent in the same environment  show high rates of dna exchange probably by conjugation as suggested for streptococcus agalactiae  <cit>  and enterococcus fecalis  <cit> . in contrast strain lens, which has been identified to date only twice, in lens  and in germany, very few dna transfers with the studied l. pneumophila strains seem to have taken place. furthermore, some regions may be transferred also between several strains. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  along  <dig> kb of the genome of l. pneumophila hl  <dig>  <dig>  philadelphia and lorraine as compared to the same region in the genome of strain paris. we identified a region of  <dig> kbs a snp frequency of  <dig> %. except an indel of  <dig> bs that shows higher polymorphism, only  <dig> snps are present in this region. this fragment may have evolved by conjugative transfer and recombination between strains philadelphia and paris. among others, this region carries the genes necessary for lipopolysaccaride biosynthesis, that are also part of the smaller fragment that has been exchanged with strain hl  <dig>  <dig>  our analyses suggest, that in addition to frequent intragenic recombination also recombination and horizontal transfer of large chromosomal fragments is taking place and shapes the chromosomes of l. pneumophila.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the genome sequences of six l. pneumophila strains shows that the genomes of this environmental pathogen evolve by frequent hgt and high recombination rates. most interestingly, these events take place between eukaryotes and prokaryotes and among different strains and species of legionella. a genome-wide map analysis of nucleotide polymorphisms among these six strains demonstrated that each chromosome is a mosaic of large chromosomal fragments from different origins suggesting that exchanges of large dna regions of over  <dig> kb have contributed to the genome dynamics in the natural population. the many t4ss might be implicated in exchange of these fragments by conjugal transfer. plasmids also play a role in genome diversification and are exchanged among strains and circulate even between different species of legionella. importantly, plasmids seem to excise and integrate into the genome probably depending on environmental cues. however, l. pneumophila encodes also several toxin anti-toxin that might help to stabilize certain mobile genetic elements. in the near future, the analyses of  <dig> s of genomes thanks to new generation sequencing combined with molecular studies should provide further clues about the genetic mechanisms and the evolutionary forces that shape the legionella genomes.
