BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the most important human pathogens of all times, is today an even more serious menace because of its increasing resistance to penicillin, the first-choice antibiotic  <cit> . it is a fastidious organism to grow both in vitro and in animal infection models. probably because of the wide genetic diversity of this organism and its exclusive nature as human pathogen, it is difficult to obtain comparable cell production when culturing different strains even within the same serotype  <cit> .

in the field of experimental animal models there is also wide variation in the susceptibility of mice strains and specific organs to infection with s. pneumoniae  <cit> . while new drugs with activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae  are being discovered, only penicillin-susceptible strains grow in the lungs of experimental animals with some consistency  <cit> . although other organs such as the thighs of neutropenic mice are susceptible to progressive infection with prsp, a reproducible pneumonia model remains elusive for most strains of prsp.

little attention has been given to the culture conditions of s. pneumoniae, critical to obtain the appropriate amount of viable log-phased cells to inoculate the animals. s. pneumoniae was reclassified within the group of anaerobic bacteria because its relatively small genome simply lacks many genes required for aerobic growth  <cit> . as a gram-positive catalase-negative coccus that generates h2o <dig> via a flavoenzime system, it grows better in presence of a source of catalase such as red blood cells  <cit> . in contrast to most bacteria, s. pneumoniae also requires choline for growth in defined media, and reducing agents are almost essential. growth of most strains requires vitamin b complex , adenine, guanine, uracil, and 7– <dig> amino acids. its energy metabolism is fermentative, yielding primarily low levels of lactic acid, but optimum ph for growth is  <dig>  with a range of  <dig> – <dig>   <cit> . besides these limitations, s. pneumoniae displays a particularly effective quorum sensing system that activates several potent autolysins once certain conditions are met within the growing population, and this is perhaps the most important hurdle to overcome when trying to obtain viable log-phased cells  <cit> . among several factors not well understood, culture acidification is one of the conditions met by the growing population that clearly contributes to start the autolysis process  <cit> .

we hypothesized that optimization of culture conditions tending to prevent environmental acidification and its consequent activation of autolysis mechanisms could lead to better production of prsp in vitro, and aimed to determine and provide such ideal conditions for the growth of this microorganism, so they could be applied to diverse strains of clinical importance to develop a reproducible animal model of pneumonia.

RESULTS
susceptibility testing
minimal inhibitory  and bactericidal  concentrations of six antimicrobial agents for these strains are shown in table  <dig>  reduced susceptibility to penicillin was demonstrated for  <dig> strains, the other  <dig> were susceptible. among those non-susceptible,  <dig> strains displayed intermediate  and  <dig> full resistance to penicillin . only one strain  was susceptible to all six antibiotics tested, but all of them were susceptible to erythromycin and vancomycin. mic of ceftriaxone against prsp ins-e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> was  <dig> μg/ml, a value conferring intermediate resistance for csf isolates, as was the case for strain ins-e <dig> .

evaluation of baseline culture variables
the results are summarized in table  <dig>  for cryoprotection, skim milk invariably allowed recuperation of frozen organisms, while 17% glycerol failed once . during phase  <dig>  we found that two successive passes on solid media were necessary for complete recuperation after thawing, and that their optimal incubation time was  <dig> hours. after  <dig> hours colony umbilication became deeper, suggesting progression of the autolysis process  <cit> . the number of colonies from phase  <dig> employed to inoculate tube  <dig> in phase  <dig> was critical to maximize the number of viable log-phased cells:  <dig> colonies into  <dig> ml of culture broth gave the best results. since broth acidification is known to start autolysis, a low ph after  <dig> hours of incubation during phase  <dig> was used as an indicator of poor viability. compared with  <dig> colonies,  <dig> or less produced lower cell numbers with similar decrease in ph, and  <dig> or more colonies gave greater cell numbers but with a profound decrease in ph . besides 5% sheep blood, additional supplementation of trypticase soy agar  with  <dig> % yeast extract  during phase  <dig> increased the number of viable cells produced by broth culture in phase  <dig> from  <dig> – <dig>  to  <dig> – <dig>  cfu/ml.

the type of liquid media was tested before  and after diverse adjustments . standard todd hewitt broth  was more reliable than brain heart infusion  made by oxoid and bbl, because it consistently produced  <dig> – <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml per hour with all strains and lots tested. bbl-bhi production was low  from the beginning and not used further. bhi oxoid was similar to thb in cell production, but not reproducible with the different lots tested to grow strain ins-e <dig> . analysis of these four media by repeated measures anova demonstrated a non-significant difference , as expected from the similarity in production during the first few hours of cultivation. however, as illustrated by figure  <dig>  productivity at the end of each culture  was significantly better with supplemented thb compared with standard thb and bhi . while stationary and death phase with ≤  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml was reached before  <dig> hours with standard broths, supplementation of thb consistently produced ≥  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml and prolonged logarithmic growth during phase  <dig> up to  <dig> hours in tube  <dig>   <dig> hours in tube  <dig>  and  <dig> hours in tube  <dig> . incubation time during phase  <dig> was best at  <dig> hours, with longer periods resulting in poor growth during phase  <dig>  mainly determined by media acidification. adjustment of ph was fundamental during both phase  <dig> and phase  <dig>  for practical reasons, phase  <dig> broth was adjusted at the beginning of the 12-hour culture, but phase  <dig> broth was adjusted every hour. in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  the term "supplemented" also implies this protocol for ph adjustment.

supplementation and optimization of culture conditions for prsp
optimized culture conditions produced ≥  <dig> log <dig> cfu/ml of log-phased cells in phase  <dig>  these results were reproducible with all prsp strains tested  under the following protocol:

phase 0: from frozen stock , cells are resuscitated by two consecutive passes on 5% sheep blood tsa supplemented with  <dig> % yeast extract and incubated for  <dig> hours under 5% co <dig> atmosphere.

phase 1:  <dig> colonies from the second plate are inoculated into  <dig> ml of supplemented thb , followed by  <dig> successive 1: <dig> dilutions into identical liquid media . supplementation implies ph adjustment to  <dig>  with 1n naoh after addition of 2% yeast extract and  <dig> % horse blood. all  <dig> tubes are incubated for  <dig> hours under 5% co <dig> atmosphere, without additional ph adjustment.

phase 2:  <dig> ml of bacterial suspension taken from the most diluted tube with visible growth from phase  <dig> is inoculated into  <dig> ml of supplemented thb  in phase  <dig>  with most strains and under conditions just described for phases  <dig> and  <dig>  tube  <dig> or  <dig> should have visible growth by the end of phase  <dig>  tubes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> should not be used, because their ph is invariably acidic by the end of phase  <dig>  usually giving very low cell counts during phase  <dig>  after inoculation of tube  <dig>  two successive 1: <dig> dilutions are made into identical media . each one of these  <dig> tubes is incubated under 5% co <dig> atmosphere, and their ph is adjusted every hour to  <dig>  with 1n naoh. we found that optimal incubation periods were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours for tubes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

discussion
our results demonstrate that optimization of culture conditions is an easy, non-expensive and reproducible way to attain penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae growth over  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml without the need of more complex methods .

the s. pneumoniae serotypes used in this study are representative of the most frequent invasive isolates from blood and csf in colombia  <cit> .

the three standard media used initially  are recommended by american society for microbiology and clinical laboratory standards institute  for s. pneumoniae growth, but their productivity was quite different. in contrast with bhi, thb has soy bean peptone and higher ph . conversely, bbl-bhi has the highest dextrose concentration , which results in marked acidification of the media as anaerobic growth progresses  <cit> . in this aspect, we confirmed previous findings of acidic ph  inhibiting growth of penicillin resistant and susceptible s. pneumoniae strains  <cit> . to avoid media acidification, we limited the number of colonies produced during phase  <dig> to inoculate supplemented thb in tube  <dig>  and adjusted ph to  <dig>  at the beginning of phase  <dig> and every hour during phase  <dig>  since ph control is not enough to attain growth over  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml  <cit> , we addressed two additional characteristics that influence s. pneumoniae growth: autolysis and competence. the process of autolysis takes place around the upper part of the logarithmic phase of growth, is started by pheromones liberated by a complex quorum sensor system, and is characterized by extensive cellular death  <cit> . competence, or the capacity for genetic transformation, is well developed in s. pneumoniae, and particularly well in prsp, but it does not happen without repercussion in bacterial growth, both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . although the relationship between autolysis and competence not always goes in the same direction, choline mutants  have shown important changes respect to wild type pneumococci, including abnormal growth in long chains instead of diplococci, loss of competence for transformation, resistance to autolysis, and resistance to cell-wall active antibiotics  <cit> . based on these facts, we hypothesized that prevention of autolysis could improve production of viable cells even in the logarithmic phase of bacterial growth. besides offering a suitable culture media, shorter incubation times and separate culture process in three phases allowed generous bacterial growth before triggering autolysis mechanisms. given that concentrations of  <dig> log <dig> cfu/ml were obtained 1– <dig> hours before reaching the maximum incubation periods shown in figure  <dig>  inoculation of healthy cells in large numbers is possible before triggering autolysis and, probably, while pneumococci are still virulent enough to induce acute pneumonia in animal models.

goncalves et al specifically addressing the optimal growing conditions for s. pneumoniae, described a batch cultivation procedure for serotype 23f, suitable for large scale polysaccharide production to manufacture vaccines  <cit> . they used hoeprich's medium with different glucose concentrations and supplemented with various amino acids and a vitamin solution, and provided an anaerobic environment with n <dig> or co <dig>  their results, expressed in terms of biomass and polysaccharide production, are difficult to compare with ours. moreover, they used autolysis as a way of releasing polysaccharide, whereas we tried to avoid this process to obtain viable bacteria.

this is the first report on culture optimization for maximum growth of prsp with simple methods, and is directed to facilitate the use of these strains in experimental procedures such as the development of animal models of pneumonia. the cultivation conditions described here generate high concentrations of log-phased bacteria without early and inconvenient induction of autolysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrate that a standardized inoculum grown in supplemented solid and liquid media with ph adjustment and control of incubation times in three phases produces viable prsp far beyond the limiting  <dig> log <dig> cfu/ml. this method should allow improvement in experimental approaches to solve important questions regarding the biology, pathology, and therapeutics of prsp.
