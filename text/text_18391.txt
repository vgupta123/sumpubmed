BACKGROUND
genetic linkage maps are essential tools for locating genes and quantitative trait loci  that control important traits. the first linkage map covering all  <dig> autosomes of the pig was published in  <dig>  <cit> , followed by a large map containing approximately  <dig>  markers  <cit> . these maps were primarily constructed on the basis of anonymous microsatellites and restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers  <cit> . other marker types including amplified fragment length polymorphisms  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been added to online versions of the maps  <cit> .

snp-based genetic variation is found with high density throughout the genome. efficient technologies have been developed, which allow for highly parallel and cost efficient genotyping, snps have therefore become the markers of choice for genetic mapping. this makes snp maps highly suitable for association studies, fine mapping of qtls as well as haplotype determination. moreover, to identify the genes underlying monogenic and quantitative traits, it is an advantage if the maps are based on gene-associated markers, such as genic snps. genic snps, whether they are located in coding or in 5' and 3' untranslated regions are more likely to cause a functional change than those that occur outside genes  <cit> . due to linkage disequilibrium intergenic snps closely linked to causative mutations in genes of interest can be of value  <cit> . the use of gene-associated snps implies an increased knowledge of the genomic region of interest and facilitates the possibility of identifying candidate genes and the actual genes that underlie the trait. at present, more than one million porcine expressed sequence tags  are available  <cit> , and tools to evaluate and select candidate snps in coding regions for application as genetic markers have been developed  <cit> .

the pig genome has more conserved synteny with human than with mouse  <cit>  and many of the porcine ests are orthologs of parts of human genes. human-pig comparative maps based on ests exclusively  <cit>  as well as ests in combination with bacterial artificial chromosome  end sequences  <cit>  have been constructed using the inra-minnesota porcine radiation hybrid panel, imprh <dig>  <cit> . this panel is a valuable tool for map refinement as it allows good precision in mapping. moreover, a highly continuous bac map of the pig genome has been developed  <cit> . gene annotation, map positions and order of snp markers developed from ests can be verified using the information derived from the bac maps or from genes and sequences mapped in humans. in addition, comparison to human genes is a tool to link characteristics to causative genes in future qtl studies. especially for insufficiently described regions, the comparative mapping provides the possibility of identifying central genes through programmes like genedistiller  <cit> .

previously, snps have been used for mapping only selected parts of the pig genome  <cit> . here we present a linkage map covering all  <dig> porcine autosomes. the map is based on a large number of offspring and a high number of meioses that is suitable to establish gene order and genetic distances. in addition to application in gene-based genome-wide qtl and association studies, a map based on snps developed from est sequence data is of value for the porcine genome project, providing information for validation of assembly and ordering of sequenced regions. furthermore, this snp map is useful as an anchoring map for future dense maps based on data from the porcinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip  <cit>   due to marker overlap.

RESULTS
snp selection and genetic map
the  <dig>  exons, from which the snps were identified, were distributed on all  <dig> human chromosomes. a total of  <dig> snps were initially detected in sequence alignments of the gene associated amplicons derived from est and shotgun sequences. if a snp segregated in at least one of the  <dig> duroc boar families it was selected for further analysis. of these,  <dig> snps were annotated prior to the mapping process. the remaining  <dig> snps were rejected either because of failure in assay design or low call rate in the genotyping assays. during the annotation six snps were discarded due to similarity and artefact problems. six snps  were not similar to any known gene or est in the human genome and were mapped as porcine est-based snps .

after annotation of the snp surrounding sequence the allelic structure of the snps were analysed. a between-family analysis showed differences that could only be accounted for by genotyping mistakes. differences in how the resulting clusters were interpreted emerged because it was not always clear which cluster was heterozygote and which was homozygote if only two clusters were present. the data set was therefore reduced to  <dig> snps.

the two-point analysis resulted in  <dig> large linkage groups  each assigned to one of the porcine chromosomes using the comparative map from inra  <cit> . in addition, seven small linkage groups with an average of three snps in each were produced. comparative mapping indicated that the largest of these, which comprised five snps located in the genes usp <dig>  eif2b <dig>  oma <dig>  cpt <dig>  and gpx <dig>  was associated with the distal part of porcine chromosome  <dig> . a few individual snps were assigned to linkage groups based on slightly lower lod scores  together with comparative association, whereas the remaining small linkage groups and singletons were rejected as a consequence of low linkage ability. finally, a total of  <dig> snps, distributed on  <dig> different genes, and six est sequences were mapped to the  <dig> porcine autosomes .

the sex-averaged map covered  <dig> . <dig> cm with an average snp distance of  <dig>  cm, whereas the female map covered  <dig> . <dig> cm and the male map  <dig> . <dig> cm . the chromosome length of the sex-averaged maps ranged from  <dig>  cm for ssc  <dig> and  <dig>  cm for ssc  <dig>  and the number of snps on each chromosome map varied between six and  <dig> on ssc  <dig> and ssc  <dig>  respectively . a comparison of the sex-averaged, female and male maps is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the exact snp position on these maps as well as information regarding maf in the sows, number of meioses and heterozygous sires are indicated in additional file  <dig> 

 <dig> sus scrofa chromosome  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms

the bac assembly sequence of each chromosome is shown in relation to the genetic linkage maps as well as human reference sequences . microsatellites linked to evenly spaced markers using the imprh <dig> on each ssc are also presented in the figures.

snp localisation
a total of  <dig> % of the sequences was matched to genes by blast analysis against the refgene database. the remaining sequences were not matched to the available human exon information and as a consequence the genic status of these were classified as unknown .

validation through comparative mapping
comparison of our linkage map and the rh-based comparative map from inra indicated a high correlation with the expected pattern of gene localisation. the marker gene order of the genetic map was compared to the order of previously physically and genetically mapped porcine genes. only one of the genetically mapped genes f13b differed from previous results by being mapped to chromosome ssc  <dig> instead of ssc  <dig> . some genes or regions showed rearrangements on the porcine map compared to the expected order. to verify the linkage mapping the snp-containing sequences in question were mapped onto the imprh <dig> panel .

for a better comparison to the microsatellite map evenly spaced snp-containing sequences were mapped onto the imprh <dig> panel . a few rearrangements in the microsatellite order in relation to our snp map were found.

comparisons to the available chromosomes of the bac assembly indicated a high similarity with the marker order. a total of  <dig> snp sequences were found to match the chromosomes ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by blast analysis against the bac assembly . the relation between distance of markers on the assembly map and the genetic map was about 1: <dig> within each chromosome . however, there was no obvious relation between the lengths of the bac assembly and the genetic map between chromosomes indicating a difference in recombination rate between the individual chromosomes.

markers were mapped to previously reported syntenic regions  <cit>  except for three large segmental regions that was not identified in our study, two at ssc  <dig> from human chromosomes   <dig> and  <dig>  and one at ssc  <dig> equal to hsa 22q12-qter. none of the genes that were located in the linkage group matching ssc  <dig> have previously been mapped in pig and hence the verification and orientation of this chromosome relies on the comparative map and linkage to microsatellites located on ssc  <dig>  all the genes showed homology to hsa 17p <dig> -q <dig> indicating that these genes most likely should be located on ssc  <dig>  this was further indicated by imprh <dig> mapping of five snp-containing sequences belonging to the ssc  <dig> linkage group .

through linkage to the rh-mapped microsatellites  <cit>  it was confirmed that the snps covered a large part of the autosome. however, by comparison to the linkage map  <cit>  that relates to the rh-map, about 20% seems to be missing. the map presented here is shorter due to missing markers on parts of ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> 

discussion
the map presented here is the first map of all  <dig> porcine autosomes based on gene-associated snps and it contains  <dig> not previously located genes. the positions of  <dig> snp-containing sequences representing these genes were confirmed by blast analysis against the newly assembled bac porcine sequence .

a total of  <dig> gene-associated and six porcine est-based snps identified from re-sequenced exons were mapped to the  <dig> porcine autosomes. the main selection of the snps was unbiased as they were found randomly in the amplicons containing the est sequences, which were distributed across the  <dig> human autosomes. almost all snps showed heterozygosity in the sires except  <dig> snps that were included because of interest to other projects. as the snps were selected on linkage ability with a very high two-point lod score  the number of informative meioses is expected to be high. in the present study it ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  allowing us to calculate a very robust map. the family comprised duroc sires crossed with danish landrace/danish large white sows and as the snps were selected from alignments of re-sequenced exons in the  <dig> duroc sires this implies that most of the informative meioses arose from this population. for the sow population we considered instead the minor allele frequency  of each snp which gave us an idea of the distribution between male and female meiosis. the analysis did not indicate that the difference in meiosis numbers affected the results as the number generally was very high .

the length of the averaged-sex linkage map was calculated to be  <dig> . <dig> cm, the female map was  <dig> . <dig> cm and the male map was  <dig> . <dig> cm. as described in the result section when comparing to the map of rohrer and colleagues  <cit>  our map is about 20% shorter. the animal material they used to create their linkage map is much smaller than the material used here, which might influence the recombination rates at the ends of the chromosomes and thereby overestimate the length. we see this phenomenon on the female map when the number of meioses is low like on ssc 17p where the mcm <dig> marker is positioned  <dig> cm from mkks . the first whole-genome map estimated the female map to be about  <dig> morgan  and the male map around  <dig>  m  <cit> . when these female and male maps are compared a recombination ratio of  <dig> : <dig> is found. another estimation of the ratio suggests the recombination ratio to be  <dig> : <dig>  <cit> . in our case the ratio was even higher, approximately  <dig> : <dig>  resembling the human recombination ratio of  <dig> : <dig>  <cit> .

when considering each chromosome map of the female and male only three chromosomes separate from the rest . the ssc  <dig> and the ssc  <dig> differ from the rest by having a longer male map. regarding ssc  <dig>  this is in accordance with previous work where a longer p-arm of the ssc  <dig> male map was found  <cit> . however, these authors also reported that the complete male map of ssc  <dig> was shorter than the female map, which could be the case in the present study too if the entire map of ssc  <dig> was available. on ssc  <dig> there is a clear difference in how the distance of the markers on the female and male maps varies across the entire chromosome as reported previously  <cit> . however, the female map presented here is longer than the male map, which is due to a single marker  positioned at the telomeric end of ssc 1q. the maf found in the sow population of this marker is low leading to few female informative meioses, which can explain the high recombination rate between the markers ndufa <dig> and c9orf <dig> on the female map.

the linkage analysis showed that most synteny groups were present and only few single gene and micro rearrangements were found. three synteny regions at ssc  <dig> were not represented on the linkage map, i.e. the hsa 14q <dig> region and both extremes of hsa  <dig>  the hsa 22q12-qter, which mapped to ssc  <dig>  <cit> , was also not present on our map. in addition to the absence of these regions, segments from four human chromosomes were missing on ssc  <dig> , ssc <dig>  and ssc  <dig>  when comparing to the comparative segments identified by meyers and colleagues  <cit> . these regions were missing due to the fact that no snps were identified in exons representing these genomic areas. however, on ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> the map presented here contains nine additional regions. in addition, the telomeric ends of ssc  <dig> and  <dig> were divided in more segments than the previous comparative map  <cit> , though in general the present map is divided in fewer segments, probably due to fewer markers. apart from this, the similarity concerning conserved synteny between these two maps is very high.

all single gene rearrangements and snps denoting porcine ests were analysed to verify the linkage order. a total of ten genes and six ests were mapped onto the imprh <dig> panel and in all cases the location was confirmed . the six ests were all mapped to the human genomic sequence. in three cases the location matched the expected synteny group but for p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> the human homologous region could not be determined.

the nine new regions discussed above were mapped onto the imprh <dig> panel to confirm their locations. these regions refer to the following genes: pcbd <dig> from hsa 10q <dig>  on ssc 3; ndrg <dig> and rpl <dig> from hsa 20q <dig>  and hsa 17q <dig>  respectively, on ssc 7; ostf <dig> from hsa 9q <dig>  on ssc 8; mylip from 6p <dig>  on ssc 9; lin <dig> from hsa 19p <dig>  on ssc 10; ywhab from hsa 20q <dig>  on ssc  <dig> and finally idh <dig> and ubl <dig> from hsa 2q <dig> and hsa 19p <dig> , respectively, on ssc  <dig>  none of these genes/human regions have previously been mapped to these porcine chromosomal locations  <cit> , but ndrg <dig>  rpl <dig> and ywhab were confirmed by blast of the snp-containing sequence against the recently assembled porcine map  <cit> . moreover, all gene locations and orders in relation to other markers were confirmed by linkage to the microsatellite rh-map  <cit> . most of the single gene rearrangements were located in regions between larger synteny groups, which also support the calculated marker order on this genetic map.

of the  <dig> genes and ests located on the map, a total of  <dig> genes have previously been mapped either by linkage or physically and all of these except one were mapped to the expected chromosome. the f13b gene located at hsa 1q <dig>  deviated as it was formerly mapped by linkage analysis to ssc  <dig>  <cit> , but as this fragment of the human genome is known to correspond to a region on ssc  <dig>  <cit>  the difference is highly likely. the linkage result of f13b to ssc  <dig> was confirmed by mapping the gene onto the imprh <dig> panel.

only two previously physically mapped genes were ordered differently than expected. the first was the tpm <dig>  which was mapped to ssc 2q24-q <dig>  <cit> . in the present study it was positioned further up on the linkage map than mef2c on ssc 2q21-q <dig> . on the comparative map of this region, only tpm <dig> from hsa  <dig> is located among genes from hsa  <dig>  <cit>  which indicates that our positioning of the tpm <dig> gene among other genes from hsa  <dig> might be correct. the other gene that was located at a different position than expected was fut <dig> from ssc 6q <dig> . this gene was previously cytogenetically mapped closer to the centromeric region than the genes from ssc 6q <dig>  <cit> . in our analysis the gene was located more distal, close to the xrcc <dig> gene from the same human chromosomal region on hsa 19q <dig> . the xrcc <dig> gene has previously been mapped to ssc 6q12- <dig>  <cit>  which might be the actual position of the fut <dig> gene as well.

a total of  <dig> genes were matched by blast analysis of snp-containing sequences against the preensembl porcine bac sequence. for nine short regions containing one to three markers on the chromosomes, minor rearrangements of the gene order occurred . within these regions of minor rearrangements the distance between the markers was small both on the linkage map and on the bac assembly. the discrepancies could be caused by rearrangements in the bac assembly of the porcine chromosomes or deviations on the genetic map, due to missing segregations in some boar families despite the snp network resulting from sows having litters with more than one boar. however, these areas should be subject to further investigation.

this snp map forms the basis for ongoing studies on qtls for meat quality, growth, osteochondrosis, lung diseases and other traits. an advantage of the map is the ability to compare to previously reported qtl studies made on microsatellite markers as well as the fact that  <dig> of the snps is represented on the new illumina porcinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip  <cit> . the actual snp overlap can be identified through the porcinesnp <dig> name . therefore, the map can function as an anchoring map for future maps created by use of bead chip technology. furthermore, new snps can be added to this version of the map for fine-mapping.

CONCLUSIONS
of the  <dig> genetically mapped snps, a total of  <dig> genes were located for the first time on the porcine chromosomes. the linkage map of the porcine genome reported here is based on a large number of meioses providing high accuracy in the relative ordering of genes and in the estimate of genetic distances. only few discrepancies were observed between the present and previous studies. as this map was calculated on gene-associated snps the generated snp map will be valuable for further qtl and association studies of porcine traits with importance for health and production as well as for verifying the genome assembly. in addition, it will be useful as a framework map.
