BACKGROUND
micrornas  are an important small noncoding family of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotide long endogenous rnas that play critical roles in cognate mrna cleavage and translational repression  <cit> . they participate in a variety of cell physiological functions such as metabolism, differentiation, morphogenesis, development and apoptosis  <cit> . large numbers of mirna have been identified in almost all genetically dissected species including animals, plants, and viruses . experimental evidence implies that mirnas can regulate tumor susceptibility genes  <cit> , and expression profiling assays have uncovered characteristic mirna signatures in human tumors  <cit> . microrna-induced transcriptional gene silencing through de novo dna methylation or chromatin modification has been demonstrated in yeast and plants <cit> . although it has been reported that exogenous sirnas can mediate transcriptional inhibition through promoter methylation in human cells and mirna could act as a cis-regulator to modulate gene expression  <cit> , transcriptional inhibition directed by endogenous small noncoding rnas remains to be reported.

homeobox genes are a group of evolutionarily conserved members that regulate animal morphological diversity at the organismal and evolutionary level  <cit> . computational analyses have identified most vertebrate and invertebrate hox genes as putative mirna targets. it is believed that knowledge about the relationship between hox genes and mirnas is important for the understanding of the hox gene regulatory mechanism in animal development as well as in tumor invasion and metastasis  <cit> . the human hsa-mir-10a locus maps upstream of hoxb <dig> and the hsa-mir-10b locus is similarly situated in the promoter region of hoxd <dig> . hsa-mir-10a and hsa-mir-10b deviate in only one nucleotide located at the center of their sequence, and the mir- <dig> family exhibits strong evolutionary conservation across a number of animal species such as human, mouse, zebrafish, drosophila/fly and chicken . the zebrafish mir-10a and mir-10b loci are not always coordinately expressed with their downstream hox gene suggesting that they have independent transcriptional initiation systems  <cit> . when expressed, the primary hsa-mir-10b transcript would be equivalent to a promoter-associated rna  <cit>  which could be targeted by mir-10a and thereby mediate induction of transcriptional gene silence of the hoxd <dig> locus. here, we show that an endogenous mirna transcriptionally modulates hoxd <dig> expression in human cancer cells through de novo dna methylation.

RESULTS
microrna-10a inhibits hoxd <dig> gene expression
to explore whether mir-10a can suppress hoxd <dig> expression, the expression levels of the hoxd <dig> and hoxb <dig> mrnas were compared to those of mir-10a and -10b in several human cell lines including human breast cancer cells mda-mb- <dig> and mcf <dig>  human mammary epithelial cells , hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells , cervical carcinoma cells  and lung adenocarcinoma cells  . the hoxd <dig> expression is high in mda-mb- <dig> cells, but low in mcf- <dig> cells and mcf10a cells . this expression pattern is similar to that of the adjacent mir-10b locus, and is consistent with the possibility that these two loci are coordinately regulated . the expression of mir-10a is higher than of mir-10b in mcf <dig> cells, but lower than the mir-10b expression in mda-mb- <dig> cells , and the expression of mir-10a varies inversely with the expression of hoxd <dig> in all six cell types. this negative correlation indicates that mir-10a might play a role in modulating hoxd <dig> gene expression in these cells. the observation that mirnas 10a and 10b do not always present similar expression profiles as their adjacent genes resemble similar findings in zebrafish  <cit>  and could indicate that under some conditions the mirnas may be regulated independently of their adjacent hox genes .

to establish that mir-10a inhibits hoxd <dig> gene expression, we first performed in vitro loss-of-function analyses by silencing the mirna with antisense oligonucleotides and assessing hoxd <dig> gene expression. quantitative pcr showed that unlike negative control 2'-o-methyl oligos  or anti-mir-196a, the transfection of a modified 2'-o-methyl mir-10a antisense oligonucleotide  resulted in a 2-fold increase in hoxd <dig> mrna levels mda-mb- <dig> cells and a 4-fold increase in hoxd <dig> mrna levels in mcf <dig> cells. no change was observed in the expression levels of the adjacent hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> loci , indicating that the mir-10a-induced hoxd <dig> gene suppression did not affect other regions on the same chromosome. nor was there any change in hoxd <dig> protein expression levels when mda-mb- <dig> cells were transfected with negative control 2'-o-methyl oligos  or anti-mir-196a , suggesting the observed increase in hoxd <dig> expression is a specific effect of the endogenous mir-10a.

microrna-10a decreases hoxd <dig> gene expression through transcriptional inhibition
to determine whether mir-10a over-expression would influence the hoxd <dig> mrna expression level,  <dig> nm mir-10a duplex was transfected into mcf <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells . in both cell lines, the result was a five to eight fold decrease in the hoxd <dig> mrna levels  <dig> hrs after transfection. western blot analysis of mda-mb- <dig> cells showed that the hoxd <dig> protein levels were consistent with the results obtained with qpcr . it has been reported that mir-10a could target the 3'utr sequence of the hoxd <dig> gene  <cit> , but based on current algorithms  there are no likely mir-10a target sites in the 3'utr of the hoxd <dig> mrna. we assessed the levels of mirna silencing by cloning the 3'utrs of these two genes into a luciferase reporter. we found that transfection of  <dig> nm mir-10a duplexes into mcf <dig> cells caused a 50% decrease in luciferase activity in the reporter containing the hoxd <dig> 3'utr while no changes was detected in cells expressing the reporter with the hoxd <dig> 3'utr . however, upstream of the hoxd <dig> transcription initiation site there is a site with near perfect complementarity to the mir-10a sequence. an intriguing question is therefore whether mir-10a could regulate hoxd <dig> gene expression in a transcriptional manner. to establish that the loss of hoxd <dig> expression was due to transcriptional silencing by mir-10a, we carried out nuclear run-on experiments . hoxd <dig> transcription was almost abolished in mcf <dig> nucleii when treated with mir-10a duplexes, whereas no changes were observed when mcf <dig> was transfected with the sirna sid <dig> designed to target the hoxd <dig> mrna for cleavage. when mcf <dig> cytoplasmic extracts were treated similarly, both mir-10a and sid <dig> significantly reduced hoxd <dig> mrna levels, suggesting that the mir-10a induced hoxd <dig> gene downregulation is achieved at the transcriptional level.

to test whether mir-10a-induced suppression of hoxd <dig> mrna is common in other human cell lines, mcf10a, hepg <dig>  hela and a <dig> were also investigated. all six cell types showed a similar tendency towards reduced hoxd <dig> expression when transfected with  <dig> nm mir-10a . to determine which part of the mirna sequence is most important for the observed effects, we mutated the mir-10a sequence in either the first  five basepairs , in the middle five basepairs , or in the last  five basepairs , and analyzed the effects of the mutant mir-10a duplexes in mcf <dig> cells . transfection with mir-10a-g5' and mir-10a-m inhibited hoxd <dig> mrna expression to the same extent as did wildtype mir-10a, however, transfection with mir-10a-g3' produced nearly no inhibition of the hoxd <dig> mrna expression . these data indicate that mir-10a specifically decrease hoxd <dig> expression through transcriptional inhibition, and suggest that the 3'most portion of mir-10a is most important for this activity.

microrna-10a-induced transcriptional inhibition of hoxd <dig> is related to promoter-associated ncrnas
the human mir-10a and mir-10b sequences deviate in only one nucleotide, and the mature mir-10a could in principle regulate hoxd <dig> by targeting the primary mir-10b transcript. expression of intergenic ncrna loci has been shown to influence the expression of other, nearby loci in the human genome, and several noncoding rnas have been detected upstream of hoxd <dig> locus  <cit> . to assess whether mirna-induced transcriptional inhibition of the hoxd <dig> locus depends on the target site being located within a promoter-associated transcript  <cit> , several rna duplexes complementary to the hoxd <dig> promotor were designed. the duplexes were designed to target nc-hoxd4- <dig>  nc-hoxd4- <dig>  or nc-hoxd4- <dig> loci  <cit>   or the non-transcribed sequence spacing these loci  . in accordance with the idea that rna expression is required for promoter targeting, we found that two of the sirnas targeting ncrna loci  in mcf <dig> cells inhibited hoxd <dig> expression, whereas the sirnas targeting the intervening non-transcribed sequence sid <dig> and sid <dig> had almost no effect in hoxd <dig> expression . further analysis of the effect of the sirnas showed that both si-nc <dig> and si-nc <dig> clearly reduced the levels of their respective noncoding transcript targets , whereas si-nc <dig> did not affect the expression level of nc-hoxd4- <dig>  possibly also explaining the failure of this sirna to affect hoxd <dig> expression. to explore whether the secondary structure of the promoter-associated rna target would influence the observed transcriptional inhibition, two rna duplexes was designed to target the pri-mir-10b transcript either at the stem region  or the loop region . the sip <dig> duplex decreased the expression of hoxd <dig> even more strongly than did the mir-10a duplex, whereas transfection with the sip <dig> duplex had no affect on the hoxd <dig> expression . the data thus suggest that mirna-induced transcriptional inhibition is mediated through interference with promoter-associated transcripts, and that the secondary structure of the promoter-associated ncrnas can influence the inhibitory effect.

mir-10a/b do not silence transcription of immediate downstream genes
if the transcriptional inhibition of hoxd <dig> expression is achieved by mir-10a targeting the mir-10b primary transcript, then the possibility remains that it could also target its own primary transcript. to assess this possibility and also whether mir-10b might target the primary mir-10a transcript and thereby induce transcriptional inhibition its adjacent hoxb <dig> locus, the hoxd <dig> and hoxb <dig> mrna levels in mcf <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells were evaluated by quantitative rt-pcr. the results show that hoxd <dig> expression was reduced when transfected with the mir-10a duplexes, and similarly that hoxb <dig> was downregulated after transfection with mir-10b. neither mir-10a nor mir-10b reduced the expression of their respective immediate downstream hox locus, possibly indicating that none of these mirnas are able to target their own primary transcripts . mir-10a/b and mir- <dig> are both encoded in the promoter region of genes, and the observation that mir- <dig> has as a cis-regulatory role may be very important in mirna research <cit> . although, there are no negative correlations between the expression of the mirnas and their respective host genes, and mirnas target their homologous pre-mirna sites to modulate gene expression would be also another interesting research topic in molecular biology.

dicer and ago1/ <dig> proteins are involved in mir-10a induced transcriptional gene inhibition
previous studies have shown that sirnas targeting selected promoter regions of human genes require the recruitment of the argonaute  <dig>  and argonaute  <dig>   <cit> . also knockdownofdicer relieve the transcriptional inhibition and attenuate abnormal promoter methylation in human cells  <cit> . we decided to test whether transcriptional inhibition induced by endogenous small noncoding rnas is ago-dependent, and also whether dicer is involved in this process. specific sirnas targeting agos 1– <dig>  and dicer  were shown to knock-down the corresponding argonaute and dicer mrna efficiently  <cit> . each of these sirnas was transfected into mcf <dig> cells, either alone or in combination with the mir-10a duplex. co-transfected with the mir-10a duplex, siago <dig> or sidicer almost completely prevented the reduction in hoxd <dig> expression induced by mir-10a . siago <dig> produced a similar, but less pronounced effect. these data show that ago <dig> and ago <dig> are required for the induction of transcriptional inhibition by endogenous small noncoding rnas. the effect of dicer knockdown further suggests involvement of this protein in dna methylation of the hoxd <dig> promotor.

microrna-10a-induced inhibition of transcription is associated with dna methylation of the hoxd <dig> promotor
transcriptional silencing is commonly associated with epigenetic chromatin modifications. to test whether mir-10a suppresses hoxd <dig> expression by de novo dna methylation, mcf <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells were treated for  <dig> days with  <dig>  μm 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine , a dna methylotransferase  inhibitor. in mcf <dig> cells, the 5-aza-dc treatment clearly upregulated the expression of the p <dig> gene, whose promotor is normally methylated, but did neither affect the expression of the unmethylated gapdh gene nor affect the expression of mir-10a . treatment with 5-aza-dc increased the hoxd <dig> mrna level about 5-fold in mcf <dig> cells, compared to only 2-fold in mda-mb- <dig> cell lines for  <dig> days . to show that mir-10a can silence hoxd <dig> expression by promoter methylation, mcf <dig> cells and mda-mb- <dig> cells were transfected with either the mir-10a duplexes or anti-mir-10a, and then treated with  <dig> μm 5-aza-dc for  <dig> h. we found that after inhibiton of the dna methylotransferase activity, mir-10a could no longer silence hoxd <dig> mrna expression .

targeting promoters with sirnas have been shown to relative with the facultative heterochromatin marks h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> in human cells  <cit> . to determine whether mir-10a could induce these repressive histone modifications, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation  to screen the hoxd <dig> promoter for h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> at regions overlapping the mir-10a target site  and the bisulphite sequencing pcr  detection site . western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> in the promoter region of the hoxd <dig> gene . after transfection with mir-10a, an increase in h3k27me <dig> in the two analysed regions  was observed in both mcf <dig> cells and mda-mb- <dig> cells . we next analysed the dna methylation status by performing bisulphite sequencing of the hoxd <dig> promoter. aberrant methylation is often observed in cancer cells. cpg and cpnpg methylation are both strongly correlated with gene silencing in plants. cpnpg methylation is rare in the human genome, and no functional implications for gene silencing have ever been documented <cit> . consistents with previous studies  <cit> , we found no cpnpg methylation in the our bisulfite-sequenced region . cultures treated with mock duplexes presented cpg methylation in this region, but consistent with the observation that the hoxd <dig> mrna level is lower in mcf <dig> than in mda-mb- <dig> cell lines, the hoxd <dig> promoter region was clearly more densely methylated in mcf <dig> cells than in mda-mb- <dig> cells. when the cultures were transfected with mir-10a duplexes, the extent of methylation increased compared to cultures treated with control rna duplexes. contrarily, when cells were treated with 2'-o-methyl-mir-10a , we found that the extent of methylation decreased and was accompanied by upregulation hoxd <dig> expression in both cells types . these results thus indicate that the mir-10a-induced inhibition of hoxd <dig> transcription is accompanied by de novo dna methylation and h3k27me <dig> formation in the targeted promoter region.

discussion
we demonstrate that an endogenous small noncding rna involved in transcriptional gene regulation in human cells. this observation gives new insights into the mechanisms by which an increase in the mir-10a expression leads to a concomitant reduction in the hoxd <dig> expression. bidirectional transcription leading to two functionally different mirnas originating from the same genomic locus has been reported in flies  <cit> . here, we show that two mirnas, mir-10a and mir-10b, mapping to two different chromosomes, can target each other's primary transcipts to repress the expression of neighboring hox genes. antisense rna-mediated gene silencing and de novo methylation of cpg islands in the promoter have been demonstrated in humans  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms by which small rnas mediate dna methylation of targeted promoter regions in the human genome remains to be elucidated. some groups have observed sirna-directed dna methylation at targeted promoters  <cit>  whereas others have not found such an effect  <cit> . a recent report has showed that mir-10a could bind the 5'utr of ribosomal protein mrnas and enhance their translation  <cit> . one possible explanation for this observation might that non-coding rnas are expressed in the target region. it has been demonstrated that promoter-associated noncoding rnas can be recognized by mirnas and direct epigenetic silencing complexes to the corresponding targeted promoters, thereby mediating transcriptional inhibition  <cit> . in the case of the hoxd <dig> locus, the adjacent pri-mir-10b could serve as a promoter-associated non-coding rna, mediating induction of transcriptional silencing when targeted by mir-10a.

recently, dicer has been reported to attenate abnormal promoter dna methylation in cancer cells  <cit> . our results define the first case in which an endogenous mirna targets and methylates a promoter region through dicer action. in plants, methylation is a crucial step in microrna biogenesis, and depends on hen <dig>  a methyltransferase that adds a methyl group to the 3'-most nucleotide of small non-coding rnas in both plants and mammals  <cit> . mirnas that regulate rbl2-dependent dnmt expression in mouse embryonic stem cells have also been detected  <cit> . ago <dig> and ago <dig> has been shown to be involved in sirna-directed chromatin modification, including histone methylation and non-cpg dna methylation in plants and yeast  <cit> . ago <dig> is required for both sirna-mediated transcriptional gene silencing and the recruitment of histone methyltransferase activity to h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> at a sirna-targeted promoters in human cells  <cit> , and ago <dig> has the ability to interact with methyltransferases  <cit> . here we show that ago  <dig> and ago <dig> participate in mirna-mediated de novo dna methylation in human cancer cells, further implicating both the mirna machinery and the chromatin remodelling complexes in rna directed transcriptional gene silencing.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data support the notion that an rna-operated system is involved in transcriptional regulation of genes in human cells. endogenous small non-coding rnas might control or fine-tune gene expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. an understanding of such a regulatory system could prove valuable in targeted approaches to specific control of gene expression and treatment of human cancers.
