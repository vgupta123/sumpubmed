BACKGROUND
legumes are one of the three largest families of flowering plants, have diverged from a common ancestor around  <dig> million years ago , and are major players for biological nitrogen fixation with important contributions to agricultural systems
 <cit> . soybean  is the most important crop among legumes, providing ~70% dietary proteins and ~30% edible oil
 <cit> . soybean has  <dig> pairs of chromosomes with a predicted genome size of  <dig> -mb
 <cit>  and is a paleopolyploid with two lineage-specific whole genomic duplications . the most recent wgd in soybean history occurred at about  <dig> million years ago 
 <cit> , more recent than those in the history of the model plants arabidopsis and rice. the recently sequenced soybean genome with  <dig> megabase   of assembled sequences has revealed the presence of many thousands of recent paralogs due to wgd
 <cit> , making it an excellent model for study the evolution of duplicate genes.

the genome sequences allowed the annotation of over  <dig>  genes, including  <dig>  that were designated as high-confidence genes, and ~ <dig>  that were predicted bioinformatically with lower confidence
 <cit> . recent transcriptome data provided evidence that soybean has a total of  <dig>  transcripts
 <cit> . the relatively recent wgd and tandem duplications  have resulted in a genome with ~75% of the genes being members of multi-gene families
 <cit> . in particular, among the  <dig>  high-confidence genes, there are  <dig>  groups of 2– <dig> close paralogs, including tandemly repetitive genes, while  <dig>  other genes are single copy
 <cit> . a recent study updated the duplicated genes to  <dig>  pairs/groups,  <dig> of them are pairs driven from the latest wgd
 <cit> . furthermore, soybean genome has  <dig>  repetitive elements occupying 59% of the genome, which covers most types of the plant’s transposable elements
 <cit> . however, the gene annotation in the soybean genome is still incomplete, and can be further improved by using information from genome-wide information of gene expression, including detection of novel transcribed regions and alternative splicing events.

the recent development of high-throughput rna sequencing  technologies has greatly improved sensitivity of transcriptomics and allowed detection of transcripts without a priori gene models
 <cit> . rna-seq has been applied extensively and successfully to explore genome-wide expression patterns, to identify novel transcripts, to detect alternative splicing events and trans-splicing rna, in organisms from yeast to human
 <cit> . transcriptomics have also been performed extensively in the model plants arabidopsis and rice, at the level of specific tissues and even single cell types, and for identification of novel transcribed regions and splicing patterns
 <cit> . it has also been applied increasingly in other plant species, such as zea mays
 <cit> , wheat
 <cit> , fragaria vesca <cit> , as well as soybean
 <cit> . however, the current knowledge about soybean transcriptome is still incomplete. for example, many predicted genes in the soybean genome are not yet supported by expression information; also, relatively little is known about the patterns of alternative splicing events in soybean. in this study, we conducted rna-seq for  <dig> soybean tissues and obtained large datasets for discovery of novel transcriptional regions and splicing transcripts, tissue preferentially or differentially expressed genes, transcription factors, conservation and divergence in expression patterns between duplicated gene pairs from recent whole genome duplications, as well as for functional implications by comparative transcriptome analyses.

RESULTS
rna-seq reveals ~  <dig>  transcriptionally active genes in soybean
to analyze the soybean  transcriptome as we had previously done for arabidopsis and zebrafish <cit> , we collected  <dig> tissues from soybean, including root tip, hypocotyl, cotyledon, callus, shoot apical meristem at  <dig>   <dig> and 38 day stage , as well as the axillary meristem , inflorescences before and after the meiotic stage , and open flower , and obtained from  <dig> to  <dig> million reads of ~50 bp for each sample, with ~30- <dig> times more data than previous rna-seq studies in soybean
 <cit> . among them,  <dig> %- <dig> % of the reads were mapped to the g. max reference genome
 <cit> , ~90% of the mapped reads matched annotated soybean genes . furthermore, the genic distribution of reads showed that 75% of mapped reads corresponded to exons, while the remaining reads were distributed among introns , intergenic regions  and the splice junctions  . therefore, our rna-seq provides high-quality data for further exploration of the soybean transcriptome.

to estimate the number of genes that are expressed in the examined soybean tissues, we first normalized the gene expression value using a variation of the rpkm method 
 <cit> , and distinguished reliable signals of gene expression from the background noise of experiments by comparison between expression level of genes and intergenic regions . we detected  <dig>  expressed genes in at least one of the  <dig> samples  ≥ -2), representing  <dig> % of all  <dig>  annotated soybean genes
 <cit> . the number of detected genes among tissues varied substantially, ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  , with more genes detected in active tissues, consistent with the results in rice
 <cit> . in comparison to the recently detected  <dig>  expressed genes in soybean
 <cit> ,  <dig>  of them were identified in our dataset and  <dig>  genes were not included , while our data detected additionally  <dig>  expressed genes that are not present among  <dig>  genes . among previously defined  <dig>  high-confidence genes
 <cit> ,  <dig>   genes were transcriptionally active in our dataset, while  <dig>   genes were undetected . conversely, our data also detected additional  <dig>  genes previously defined as low-confidence genes
 <cit> , including  <dig>  genes from  <dig>  recently designated as pseudogenes
 <cit>  , suggesting that ultra-high throughput sequencing coupling with multiple tissues is capable to identify more low level or tissue preferentially expressed genes. altogether, integration of this study and previous data suggest that a total of  <dig>  genes  are transcribed, significantly improving the soybean transcriptome annotations.

analysis of the duplicated genes caused by latest wgd
gene duplication is one of the most important mechanisms for understanding the evolutionary novelties, while divergence of the duplicated gene expression is highly correlated with their functional divergence
 <cit> . soybean has served as an attractive model plant to study this aspect due to the occurrence of two recent wgds. based on the annotated genes in the soybean genome, we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  duplicate genes  caused by td and wgd, respectively. these genes were further divided into five types regarding copies of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> or more  . our  <dig> samples detected  <dig>   and  <dig>   duplicated genes by wgd and td, indicating that the vast majority of the existing duplicated genes by wgd are expressed. to further investigate the expression difference among tested tissues between duplicated genes, we focused on the  <dig>  pairs of paralogs from wgd. our results showed that  <dig>  pairs had detectable expression for both copies,  <dig> pairs showed expression in one of the copies, while  <dig> pairs has no detectable expression in either copy . among the  <dig>  two-copy expressed genes , t-test statistical analysis showed that  <dig>  of them  showed significant expression difference between the two paralogs  , indicative of regulatory subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization, whereas the other  <dig>  paralogs  had no significant difference each other  , suggesting functional conservation and possible redundancy between two paralogs. in addition, the lack of expression for one copy of the  <dig> pairs with single copy expression suggested that they are likely candidates for regulatory nonfunctionalization, although some of them are possibly additional examples of sub/neofunctionalization as they might be expressed in other tissues not sampled here or under different growth conditions. similar trends were also found for  <dig> td genes .

transcriptome analysis identifies ~ <dig>  high-confidence ntrs in soybean
rna-seq has been widely applied to identify ntrs in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe <cit> , arabidopsis <cit> , rice
 <cit> , mouse
 <cit>  and human
 <cit> . our transcriptome data showed that a large number of reads mapped to annotated intergenic regions, suggesting that they are potential ntrs. we therefore assembled the mapped reads to obtain  <dig>  ntrs. by placing stringent requirements for the size >150 bp and read number > <dig>  as well as being detected in at least two samples, we obtained a total of  <dig>  high-confidence ntrs with a mean length of ~372 bp,  <dig>  of which were reported previously
 <cit> .

it has been reported that ntrs are either likely novel genes or represent extension of nearby annotated transcripts, probably constituting novel exons. to test the second possibility, we searched for annotated genes within a short distance  from the putative ntrs in the same orientation for transcription, and found that  <dig>  of  <dig>  ntrs were detected to extend the 5’utr of annotated genes by in-house script . further analyses of these novel and extended utrs should be helpful to the identification of additional regulatory elements. besides the  <dig>  extended genes, the other  <dig>  ntrs were assembled into  <dig>  novel transcript units , evenly distributed among  <dig> chromosomes, but enriched in chromosome arms . moreover,  <dig> randomly selected ntrs were verified as true transcripts by rt-pcr , further supporting the reliability of the identified ntrs.

among  <dig>  ntus,  <dig>   were supported by the annotated  <dig>  soybean ests in national center for biotechnology information  , but not currently annotated in the g. max genome.  <dig> of the other  <dig>   ntus were found to have homologs from other species , suggesting that they might be conserved genes. only  <dig> ntus were located in the transposable element  regions, indicating te activity . to identify potential non-coding rnas from the  <dig>  ntus, we performed a blastn alignment using ntus against rfam, and found that  <dig> ntus were annotated non-coding rna as either trna, rrna, snorna or mirna . for example, xloc_ <dig> was annotated as mir <dig>  suggesting that some of the novel ntus are functional as non-coding rnas. the nature of the remaining ntus needs to be further investigated.

we then analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution of  <dig>  ntus in the  <dig> tissues , and found that  <dig>  of them showed constitutive expression, while  <dig>  were tissue preferentially expressed. interestingly, the current soybean genome only annotates one clavata1a  gene as the ortholog of the arabidopsis clv <dig> gene regulating meristem sizes
 <cit> , while the identified xloc_ <dig> ntu is a paralog of clv1a in soybean. both genes showed specific expression in sam17d and sam38d, suggesting a redundant function of clv1a and xloc_ <dig> for regulating sam in soybean.

alternative spliced transcripts and their differential expression
as is one of major contributors for generation of proteomic and functional complexity in higher organisms
 <cit> , but at present little is known about as events in soybean. among the previously annotated  <dig>  soybean genes,  <dig>  genes have at least two exons
 <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig>  as events covering  <dig>  genes  in the  <dig> samples , indicating that ~ <dig> % of multiple-exon genes have as patterns. this is significantly lower than 48% observed in either arabidopsis or rice
 <cit> . a possible reason is that soybean has experienced two recent genome duplications, which resulted in many retained duplicated genes that are also a major source of proteomic and functional complexity
 <cit> .

we also summarized the possible existence of  <dig> as types in soybean, including four common types of intron retention , es , a3ss , a5ss  . unlike the major type of es in animals
 <cit> , intron retention was the major type of as in soybean, consistent with the observations in arabidopsis, rice, maize and soybean
 <cit> . our result and those from others suggest that the mechanism for regulation of ir in plants is conserved. the higher proportion of es events  in soybean is also in agreement with that in rice and maize
 <cit> , but significantly higher than that in arabidopsis. es has been reported to be involved in regulating tissue-specific functions
 <cit> . to investigate the tissue-specific expression of as, we performed a miso program analysis
 <cit>  to identify  <dig> tissue-bias exon skipped events, including  <dig> paralogs . most of them encode enzymes and transcription factors that are enriched for protein degradation, rna regulation, signaling and transport. we also found that several exons are recognized predominantly as exons in one tissue and also as introns in another tissue. for example, as shown in figure 
3a, the 7th exon of gm15g <dig>  showed Ψ with 88% in root tip and 6% in cotyledon , suggesting divergent functions between root tip and cotyledon. in addition,  <dig>  as events changed greatly during sam and flower development , go analysis indicated that many genes encoding proteins participate in the reproductive development process. in addition to known flowering genes exhibiting as changes, many uncharacterized genes were also observed to have significant as changes, as exemplified by gm05g <dig>  a gene with three sets of exons with mutually exclusive expression patterns .

comparison of tissue transcriptomes indicative of conservation and divergence
to investigate the similarity of the  <dig> tissues, we compared their transcriptomes to generate a heatmap on the basis of pearson correlation coefficients between any two of the transcriptomes . the lowest coefficient value of  <dig>  was between root tip and of, whereas the highest value  <dig>  was between am and sam38d . we further used hierarchical clustering  to divide the  <dig> samples into four groups:  root tip and callus;  cotyledon and hypocotyl;  sam6d, sam17d, sam38d and am;  ibm and iam;  of . the similarity of root tip and callus in group i is consistent with a previous discovery in arabidopsis that callus, even when derived from aerial organs, resembles the development of root apical meristem in terms of specific gene expression profiles
 <cit> . a recent study further solidified this similarity because the process of leaf-to-callus transition involves epigenetic activation of the root preferential gene expression
 <cit> . observation of the similar transcriptomes in soybean suggests that the molecular mechanism to determinate cell fate for callus formation could be conserved in plants. cotyledon and hypocotyl were clustered other, suggesting they are more similar as compared with other tissues . in comparison to the four tissues above, the other seven samples were grouped into one clade, as supported by close pearson’s correlation coefficient values, especially for am with either sam38d or ibm. additional comparison among the three tissues identified  <dig>  overlapping genes , which are mainly involved in the reproductive cellular processes, such as floral organ determination and stamen development , indicating that am at this developmental state shares some common features between shoot am and floral meristem. taken together, these results suggest that organ identity and cell fate determination are highly regulated by the temporal and spatial expression of genes.

identification of tissue-preferentially expressed genes
characterization of tissue or cell-specific genes provides a foundation for unraveling their molecular mechanisms. previous studies in multiple plants demonstrated that each organ or tissue has its specific transcripts
 <cit> , including soybean
 <cit> . these genes expressed more highly in one tissue  than all other tissues examined are referred to as preferentially expressed genes . to investigate the tissue pegs, we first compared the transcriptomes among  <dig> tissues and found  <dig>  tissue pegs . among these genes, root tips had  <dig> pegs, including  <dig> paralogs; go annotation showed that they were related to translational elongation, hormone signaling, cytokinin stimulus, stem cell maintenance and post-embryonic root development . in arabidopsis, pin <dig> is specifically required for auxin transport during root development
 <cit> . two paralogs similar to pin <dig> were found in soybean and showed similarly specific expression in root tips, suggesting that they have possibly redundant function in root development similar to that of pin <dig> in arabidopsis. in contrast,  <dig>  pegs identified in callus, including  <dig> transcription factors and  <dig> paralogs, were mainly involved in biotic and abiotic responses, such as defense, oxidative stress, vitamin, inorganic substance and cytokinin stimulus . the  <dig> cotyledon pegs  were enriched in photosynthesis, energy, transmitting tissue development and glucose metabolism . auxin is a crucial regulator of cotyledon development
 <cit> . we detected several other auxin-related genes, including the pair of gm09g <dig> and glyma18g <dig> paralogs that are homologs of arabidopsis pin-formed  <dig> , which is required for auxin homoeostasis and gametophyte development
 <cit> . however, both genes were found with highest expression in cotyledon, but nearly undetectable in reproductive tissues, suggesting pin <dig> may have a divergent role in soybean. in contrast, the  <dig> hypocotyl pegs  were enriched for an auxin-mediated signaling pathway, and/or photo morphogenesis , including homologs of the arabidopsis non-phototropic hypocotyl  <dig>  gene
 <cit> .

as shown in figure 
 <dig>  am was highly similar to both sam38d and ibm, pairwise comparison would probably miss many genes active in meristems. to identify pegs in these meristems , we grouped similar meristems together and detected  <dig> genes . go annotation indicated that the most enriched categories were associated with flower development and regulation, floral transition from vegetative to reproductive phase, or meristematic phase transition and transcription regulation , which is in good agreement with previous reports in soybean
 <cit> . for instance, the pegs included several homologs of short vegetative phase  that specify the reproductive organ identity and control flowering time in arabidopsis and rice
 <cit>  and genes involvement in wuschel  regulatory network essential for sam maintenance
 <cit> . we also found homologs  of genes for auxin synthesis and response, such as yucca <dig>  in accordance with the fact that the arabidopsis yucca <dig> expression is restricted to the sam and flower meristems or young floral primordia
 <cit> , as well as  <dig> genes related to auxin-responsive genes regulating sam development
 <cit> . these good agreements between our go enrichment results and known functions in meristem suggested the reliability of the collected samples for sam and conservation of molecular mechanisms for controlling sam between arabidopsis and soybean.

accordingly, am, ibm and iam together had  <dig>  pegs  , which were mainly involved in reproductive processes, such as floral organ determination and development, stamen development, tapetal layer development, pollen development . for instance, in addition to the identification of several flower organ identity genes from abc model , we also found genes specifically for meiosis, such as ms <dig>  and mmd <dig> 
 <cit> . unlike the expression of arabidopsis ms <dig> and mmd <dig> genes restricted in meiocytes, the soybean homologs showed high expression in am, suggesting a possible unknown function in soybean. interestingly, the arabidopsis dreb1b is one of the critical regulators for cold responses, and is also widely expressed
 <cit> , whereas the soybean homologs  showed special expression in am, ibm and iam, but not in other vegetative tissues, suggesting it might have gained novel functions in reproductive development in soybean. in addition, one homolog of dreb1a  was also identified, consistent with a recent novel discovery that the arabidopsis dreb1a gene is important for flower development especially under unfavorable conditions
 <cit> .

finally, open flower had  <dig>  pegs  enriched for reproductive cellular process, cell wall modification, pollen tube growth, pollination and signal transduction . particularly, at least  <dig> genes  encoded signal transduction proteins for interaction between the pollen and ovary, such as snap receptor  <dig>  leucine-rich repeat protein kinase, rop binding protein kinases  <dig>  calcium-dependent protein kinase  <dig> <cit> .

dynamic reprograming of soybean sam transcriptome
comparison of genes between soybean and arabidopsis provides clues regarding conservation of critical genes for sam development. to obtain clearer transcriptome changes during sam development, we mainly focus on  <dig>  degs during soybean sam and flower development . verification of expression of randomly selected  <dig> genes in sam by qrt-pcr, showed a high correlation  with rna-seq , supporting the reliability of our dataset. we then applied self-organizing maps 
 <cit>  to seek shared patterns of degs in relation to the developmental stage , and subsequently identified eight regions  on the basis of similarly shared patterns . among them, genes in cs <dig> were expressed above an average level in early stage of sams, but below the average level in later stage of ibm, iam and of , indicating they are important for early sam development, but not afterwards. go enrichment analysis showed that those genes mainly participate in chromatin assembly and disassembly, regulation of transcription, regulation of timing of meristematic phase transition, asymmetric cell division and auxin homeostasis , suggesting a vital role of transcription regulation for early sam development. genes in cs <dig> and cs <dig> showed stable expression in the five early reproductive tissues excluding of, but exhibited sharply decreased and increased expression in of, respectively . this indicates that the cs <dig> genes have roles in early flower development, but are not as important for the later stage. genes with such expression mainly participate in meristem development, reproductive structure development, and transcription regulation, as well as the negative regulation of protein ubiquitination . in contrast, the cs <dig> genes are more active in the later stage of flower development. those genes are involved in responses to stimulus, auxin signaling, lipid localization and spindle organization . genes in cs <dig> and cs <dig> showed similar expression patterns with an increase from sam38d to iam and then a decrease in of, but the increased levels are much higher in cs <dig> than those in cs <dig> , suggesting that those genes could be important for post-meiotic flower development. indeed, gene involvement in reproductive development was enriched by go analysis , including genes from the abc model and those required for anther or pollen development. expression levels of genes in cs <dig> and cs <dig> gradually increased with the developmental stage in sam  and reproductive  tissues, with cs <dig> genes showing higher expression levels in of than genes in cs <dig> . this indicates that the genes with elevated expression in of from cs <dig> are more active for later reproductive development processes, such as pollen tube development and pollination, as supported by go enrichment analysis . genes in cs <dig> were constitutively expressed in six tissues, and part of them showed fluctuating expressions in sam38d . those genes are important not only for basic cellular development, but also for meristem and flower development . together, further functional studies of genes from different clusters could contribute to a better understanding of the biological implications of them during sam and flower development in soybean.

distinct expression of transcription factors in sam
identification of the dynamically accumulated tfs during soybean sam and flower development is an initial step in understanding the underlying regulatory networks. current soybean genome is annotated with  <dig>  tf genes, which are classified into  <dig> different families
 <cit> . we detected a total of  <dig>  tf genes  with expression in at least one of six samples .  <dig>  of them  were differentially expressed  , uncovering nearly all families. we then classified the  <dig>  tf genes into three clusters according to distinct expression patterns .  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these tf genes were expressed at the highest levels in sams , ibm and iam , or of , respectively .

further classification of family-preferential expression showed that g <dig> mainly includes families of hmg, fha, zf-hd, sbp, tcp, c2c <dig>  gata and phd , indicating that early sam development largely requires those transcription factor families. for example, squamosa-promoter binding protein-like  proteins are a family of plant-specific tfs having a conserved sbp  domain, and play multiple roles in plant growth and development
 <cit> .  <dig> and  <dig> spls are found in arabidopsis and soybean, respectively
 <cit> , and were divided into eight clades .  <dig> spls from  <dig> clades were differentially expressed during soybean sam and flower development. available data from arabidopsis, rice and tomato support the idea that the function of genes from some different clades might still be conserved, but genes from other clades might have diverged
 <cit> . for instance,  <dig> of  <dig> arabidopsis spls  from  <dig> clades are mir156/ <dig> targets
 <cit> , and play a similar role in phase transition
 <cit> , whereas the clade i-, ii- and iii-containing genes lack mir <dig> and mir157-binding sites. the clade i contains only spl <dig> with ubiquitous expression and distinct function in regulating copper homeostasis
 <cit> . consistently, two soybean spl <dig> paralogs are also widely expressed with similar patterns, suggesting a conserved role in soybean . clade ii has four members of spl <dig>  spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig> with wide expression in arabidopsis , but only atspl <dig> has been shown to participate in vegetative to reproductive transition
 <cit> . this clade includes eight members in soybean. seven of them showed similar expression patterns to that of arabidopsis , but only gm17g <dig> was differentially expressed in sam, suggesting a function different from that of its counterpart. the clade iii has only atspl <dig> with a function in root growth and microsporogenesis
 <cit> . four soybean genes were found in this clade, and two of them had no detectable expression, suggesting possible non-functionalization. by contrast, the other two genes were specifically expressed in sam and reproductive tissues. however, unlike atspl <dig> being functional in roots, the soybean homologs were not expressed in roots, resembling that of tomato spl <dig> homologs
 <cit> . the clade iv contains atspl <dig> with constitutive expression and unknown function. however, a physcomitrella patens homolog has been reported to repress reproductive development
 <cit> , somehow similar to atspl <dig> <cit> . this clade had six soybean homologs; except for the undetectable expression of gm06g <dig>  the other five genes were highly expressed in sam and reproductive tissues. in comparison to the other  <dig> clades having more genes from soybean than arabidopsis, the clade v has three arabidopsis genes, but only two paralogs from soybean . therefore, it would be interesting to investigate possible reasons to cause gene lost on soybean in this clade.
1: figure s <dig>  only arabidopsis genes were list in each clade as reference. name of genes marked in same color are a pair of paralogs.

the most extensively characterized function of spls is promotion of the transition from vegetative and reproductive growth, and particularly for spl3- <dig> in clade vi of arabidopsis <cit> . remarkably, this clade contains  <dig> spls from soybean,  <dig> of which showed high expression in sam  and were nearly undetectable in other tissues, suggesting the conservation of molecular mechanism in regulation of the transition from vegetative and reproductive growth between arabidopsis and soybean. the last two clades of vii and viii include atspl <dig> and atspl9/ <dig>  respectively . atspl <dig> has been implicated in leaf development, while the atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> play a partially redundant role in phase transition
 <cit> . the seven and four spl genes in soybean in clade vii and viii had very similar gene expression patterns in sam and floral tissues, consistent with the functions of the arabidopsis homologs. together,  <dig> paralogs pairs were included in spl family . comparison of expression patterns suggests that the paralogs in a pair might have undergone sub-functionalization, further supporting the idea that sub-functionalization might be predominant event for duplicated gene after wgd in soybean.

different from g <dig>  g <dig> mainly contained mads, as, btb/poz, wrky, c2c <dig>  yabby . it has been reported that mads-box gene family is not only key repressors or activators for flowering transition, but also as master regulators of reproductive organ identities
 <cit> . our data detected  <dig> mads-box genes during flower development , such as gm01g <dig>  gm04g <dig>  gm08g <dig> and gm08g <dig>  which are homologs of ap <dig>  pi, ag and sep <dig>  respectively, consistent with their known function in floral organ identity. therefore, the functions of the mads-box gene family for regulation of flower development are likely conserved between soybean and arabidopsis. in contrast, bzip, c3h-type <dig> , c2h <dig>  dof, aux-iaa-arf, lim and ccaat gene families were preferentially expressed in of . many studies showed that auxin-dependent transcriptional regulation requires the auxin/indole-3-acetic acid  and auxin response factor  families of tfs
 <cit>  and formation of aux/iaa-arfs heterodimers repress auxin signaling
 <cit> . in addition to the known role of auxin in arabidopsis pollen development, pollination and fertilization also seem to need increased auxin levels
 <cit> . indeed, we detected  <dig> differentially expressed members in of, suggesting aux/iaa-arf regulatory pathway for later reproductive development is also conserved. however, the function of other enriched tfs in of is still largely unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
the paleopolyploidy and rapid divergence of the soybean genome makes it an ideal genome for evolutionary analyses. however, the present soybean genome annotation and gene expression message are incomplete. this study presents the overall transcriptional landscape and provides extensive evidence that transcriptional regulation in soybean is vastly more complex than previously expected. the data significantly improves annotation of the soybean genes predicted in genome, as well as provides essential sources for studying the expression level between duplicated genes by latest wgd and functional genome in soybean.
