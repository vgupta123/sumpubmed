BACKGROUND
chemokines are small  inducible peptides involved in migration and retention of leukocytes in tissues under physiological and pathological conditions. the chemokines exert their effects through g-protein coupled receptors on target cells. despite the potential pitfalls , the chemokine system represents an attractive therapeutic target for a broad variety of autoimmune, inflammatory and oncology disorders and all components of the system can be potentially targeted by therapeutic agents.

the chemokine cxcl <dig> is constitutively expressed in secondary lymphoid organs  by fdc and macrophages  <cit> . cxcl <dig> primarily acts through g-protein-coupled cxcr <dig> receptor  expressed on mature b lymphocytes  <cit> , cd4+ follicular helper t cells,  tissues. cxcl <dig> over-expression by fdc in these germinal centers is accompanied by dysregulation of interactions among fdcs, b cells and follicular th cells  <cit>  and reduced elimination of autoreactive b cells. subsequent, antigen-driven generation of affinity-matured long-lived plasma cells and memory b cells producing high affinity igg autoantibodies contributes to the development of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.

th <dig> cells, a subset of the th family, produce cytokines il <dig>  il <dig> and il <dig> and, under normal circumstances, play an important role in host defense against extracellular pathogens . under pathological conditions, however, th <dig> cells have been linked to the development of autoimmune inflammation, allergic disorders and cancer  <cit> . in the context of cxcl <dig> biology, th <dig> cells are of particular interest as both human and mouse th <dig> cells express cxcr <dig> receptors and are able to migrate towards cxcl <dig> in vitro  <cit> . human allo-reactive and pathogen-specific th <dig>  but not th <dig> or th <dig>  clones were shown to express cxcl <dig>  which may contribute to optimal th17-b cell interactions necessary for antibody production  <cit> . moreover, statistically significant correlation between il- <dig> and cxcl <dig> levels in synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been observed. dramatic increases in myelin-specific th <dig> cells in peripheral blood of patients with relapsing-remitting ms correlated with disease activity  <cit> . in patients with progressive ms, th <dig> cells in cooperation with tfh and activated b cell subsets have been shown to play a critical role in systemic inflammation associated with the development of meningeal ectopic lymphoid follicle-like structures  and progression of the disease  <cit> .

the family of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders where cxcl <dig> appears to be involved in disease pathogenesis and constitutes an attractive therapeutic target includes, among others, multiple sclerosis   <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis   <cit> ; hashimoto’s thyroiditis  <cit> , chronic gastritis/malt lymphoma  <cit> , graft rejection syndrome  <cit> , sjogren’s syndrome  <cit> ; systemic lupus erythematosis  <cit> , and myastenia gravis  <cit> . the mechanism of action for cxcl13-targeting treatments would involve blockade of cxcl <dig> interaction with its receptor resulting in inhibition of b, tfh and th <dig> cell migration and subsequent interference with the formation of ectopic germinal centers and development of tissue inflammation. described below is the derivation and testing of a novel monoclonal anti-cxcl <dig> antibody that binds human, cynomolgus monkey and mouse cxcl <dig>  we demonstrate that this monoclonal antibody is able to inhibit in vitro functional activity of human and mouse cxcl <dig> and present efficacy data of its murine analog in murine models of autoimmunity.

RESULTS
generation of human anti-cxcl <dig> antibody
human anti-cxcl <dig> antibody, mab  <dig>  was generated as described in detail in methods section and illustrated in figure  <dig>  first, mouse hybridoma was produced by fusing myeloma cells with splenocytes from a mouse immunized with human cxcl <dig>  mouse monoclonal antibody, selected based on its ability to bind both human and mouse cxcl <dig>  was then used as a source of v genes for the generation of the mouse-human antibody chimera. humanization of the chimeric antibody and selection of higher affinity variants using vaccinex’s proprietary activmab® technology, led to the creation of anti-human cxcl <dig> antibody mab  <dig>  for the in vivo experiments, we generated a mab 5261-based chimeric antibody containing the human v genes and mouse constant domains .figure  <dig>

to confirm cxcl <dig> specificity of mab  <dig> and mab 5261-muig we employed the following assays : elisa on a panel of recombinant human, murine and cynomolgus monkey cxcl <dig>  human cxc chemokines most homologous to cxcl <dig>  and various non-specific antigens ; flow cytometry on a panel of cell lines; and ihc on a panel of  <dig> normal human tissues. we found both antibodies to be specific for recombinant human, murine and cynomolgus monkey cxcl <dig>  the binding affinity on cxcl <dig> from these species was determined by biacore to be  <dig> nm for both human and chimeric antibodies. in addition, mab  <dig> efficiently bound cxcl <dig> from native sources : human  and mouse .

inhibition of cxcl13-mediated chemotaxis
the ability of mab  <dig> and mab 5261-muig to inhibit human cxcl13-induced cell migration was confirmed using stable cell line human pre-b-697-hcxcr <dig> and primary human tonsil cells . the effect on mouse cxcl13-mediated chemotaxis was demonstrated using splenocytes from c57bl/ <dig> and sjl/j mice , where we observed a concentration-dependent inhibition of splenocyte migration towards cxcl <dig> by each mab. migration of human pre-b-697-hcxcr <dig> cells or mouse splenocytes towards human or murine cxcl <dig> respectively, was used to confirm specificity of each anti-cxcl <dig> mab . in summary, both mab  <dig> and mab 5261-muig met functional acceptance criteria that included inhibition of cxcl13-induced migration without affecting cxcl12-induced migration.figure  <dig>

inhibition of human cxcl13-mediated endocytosis of human cxcr <dig> receptor
characteristically of all chemokine receptors, binding of a chemokine leads to an internalization of the ligand-receptor complex with subsequent activation of the associated intracellular signaling cascade  <cit> . burkle and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that incubation of human cxcl <dig> with chronic lymphocytic leukemia  cells expressing high levels of functional cxcr <dig> receptor led to time- and dose-dependent receptor endocytosis. we adapted a flow cytometry-based method described in burkle et al. to evaluate the ability of mab  <dig> and mab 5261-muig to inhibit cxcl13-mediated cxcr <dig> receptor internalization in human cells.

figure  <dig> shows the effects of mab  <dig> and mab 5261-muig on human cxcr <dig> receptor expression on the surface of human pre-b-697-hcxcr <dig> cells treated with human cxcl <dig>  both antibodies efficiently and in a titratable manner interfered with cxcl13-induced internalization of the cxcr <dig> receptor.figure  <dig>

murine anti-cxcl <dig> antibody affects splenic homing of adoptively transferred b cells in naïve balb/c mice
an in vivo functional assay was subsequently performed to determine if mab 5261-muig would inhibit the primary function of cxcl <dig>  namely the homing of b cells to the follicles in secondary lymphoid organs. to this end, an adoptive transfer experiment was conducted in female balb/c mice where b cells were isolated from spleens of untreated donor mice, labelled with cfse, and injected intravenously into recipient mice that were pre-treated with bi-weekly i.p. injections of 30 mg/kg of either mab 5261-muig or control antibody for 2 weeks prior to adoptive transfer. twenty four hours post-transfer, spleens were collected from the recipient mice and analyzed by flow cytometry and ihc to detect the presence of labeled b cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  migration of cfse-labeled donor b cells into recipient spleens showed a trend to being reduced in mab 5261-muig-treated animals, indicating that this anti-cxcl <dig> specific antibody impedes b cell homing to a secondary lymphoid organ.figure  <dig>

effect of murine anti-cxcl <dig> antibody on isotype class switching, frequency of high affinity np-specific igg <dig> producing cells and on the size and number of germinal centers in spleens of mice immunized with alum-precipitated np-klh
arnold et al. reported an impaired germinal center response in mice with cxcr5-deficient t cells that manifested in a reduction in size and number of germinal centers with a reduction in the frequency of germinal center b cells and parallel reduction in frequency of np-specific igg1-secreting cells in spleens and bone marrow  <cit> . to determine if antibody-mediated inhibition of cxcl <dig> function would have a similar effect on formation of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs and isotype class switching by naïve b cells, we treated c57bl/ <dig> mice immunized with alum-precipitated thymus-dependent antigen, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin  with mab 5261-muig or an appropriate isotype control antibody.

similar to the results described by arnold and colleagues, on day  <dig> post-immunization, no difference in the frequency of splenic np-specific igm-secreting cells was observed between control and mab 5261-muig treated groups . however, the mean frequency of class-switched np-specific igg1-secreting cells  and high-affinity  antibody) was reduced in the animals treated with mab 5261-muig. the proportion of high affinity antibodies in the total igg <dig> population  was not affected, indicating a defect in affinity maturation had not occurred, but rather a reduction in the number of antibody-producing b cells in the germinal centers of treated animals. we also observed a significant reduction in number and size of the germinal centers in the spleens of animals treated with mab 5261-muig compared with the control group , and a reduction in numbers of activated cd4 + t cells in spleens and bone marrow of mab 5261-muig antibody-treated animals . these data suggest that the potential mechanism of action of our anti-cxcl <dig> antibody involves inhibition of cxl13-mediated recruitment of b and cxcr5+ cd4+ t cells into lymphoid follicles with subsequent interference with the formation and expansion of germinal centers.figure  <dig>

murine anti-cxcl <dig> antibody reduces the severity of collagen-induced arthritis
collagen-induced arthritis in mice and rats is a well-established model of human rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . the disease is typically induced by intradermal injection of bovine type ii collagen emulsified in complete freund’s adjuvant  and is characterized by the production of mouse collagen antibodies and subsequent progressive development of arthritis in the paws. the role of cxcl <dig> in cia pathogenesis has been previously highlighted. for example, zheng et al. demonstrated that treatment with polyclonal anti-cxcl <dig> antibodies reduced disease severity and inhibited formation of germinal centers in the joints of mice affected by cia  <cit> . similarly finch and colleagues reported that in mice with an established cia, cxcl <dig> neutralization with rat anti-murine cxcl <dig> antibodies led to b cell depletion in the lymphoid tissues and significantly reduced severity of joint destruction  <cit> .

to assess the therapeutic potential of mab 5261-muig in cia, arthritis was induced in male dba/1 j mice. the mice were subjected to either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimens that consisted of bi-weekly injections of 30 mg/kg of antibody. anti-cxcl <dig> antibodies were delivered intraperitoneally, while positive control antibody, etanercept , was delivered subcutaneously. prophylactic treatment began on day  <dig> post-collagen immunization, 1 day prior to the booster immunization and continued for 3 weeks. therapeutic treatment was initiated when the group mean arthritic index  reached 3– <dig>  and continued for 2 weeks.

as evident from figure 6a-c, prophylactic treatment with mab 5261-muig resulted in a delay in disease onset and reduced rate of disease development. therapeutic treatment with mab 5261-muig , although initiated after onset of arthritis, resulted in a significantly curtailed disease development, similar to positive control etanercept. in both study designs, joints of the control mice exhibited severe inflammation, moderate cartilage damage with minimal pannus formation and bone resorption in the ankle and all digit joints . minimal inflammation and cartilage damage were observed in the mice prophylactically treated with mab 5261-muig . in the therapeutic cohort, no lesions were observed in hind paws and ankles of animals treated with either mab 5261-muig or etanercept . despite the effect on disease development and progression, serum anti-collagen ii antibody titers were not affected by the treatment with mab 5261-muig .figure  <dig>

murine anti-cxcl <dig> antibody attenuates symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, is a demyelinating disease of the cns that progressively results in escalating degrees of ascending paralysis with inflammation primarily targeting the spinal cord. eae can assume an acute, chronic or relapsing-remitting course and can be induced in mice either actively by immunization with myelin antigens ; proteolipid protein ) or passively via adoptive transfer of myelin-specific cd4+ t cells from actively immunized donors to naïve recipients  <cit> .

exploring the role of cxcl <dig> in eae pathogenesis, bagaeva et al. demonstrated that follicles containing b-cells and cxcl13-expressing dendritic cells formed in inflamed meninges of mice with relapsing-remitting eae with levels of cxcl <dig> expression rising steadily throughout the course of disease  <cit> . moreover, cxcl13-deficient mice experienced mild disease with decreased relapse rate, while blockade of cxcl <dig> with anti-cxcl <dig> mab led to disease attenuation in passively induced eae in b <dig> pl mice.

we initially tested mouse antibody 3d <dig>  the prototype of mab  <dig> , in sjl/j relapsing-remitting model of eae where this mab attenuated disease progression in  <dig> independent experiments . encouraged by the results, we used the same model of eae to evaluate the effects of mab 5261-muig. the treatment started on day  <dig> post-immunization and consisted of weekly intraperitoneal injections with 30 mg/kg of the antibodies. as evident from data shown in figure  <dig>  the treatment with mab 5261-muig resulted in significant reduction in the severity of relapsing-remitting eae.figure  <dig>

to separate eae-inducing t cell subsets and, thereby, gain better understanding of the mechanism of action of mab 5261-muig in eae models, we employed a passive method of eae induction. for that, we chose two cd4+ cell subsets: il-17-secreting th <dig> cells and ifn-γ-secreting th <dig> cells. as previously reported by jager et al., in adoptive transfer model of eae both cell types produced typical demyelinating lesions in white matter, with twice as many lesions present in th17-induced animals  <cit> . th <dig> cell recipients developed classic paralytic symptoms of eae, while the recipients of th <dig> cells in addition to the classical symptoms, also developed atypical signs of the disease that included ataxia, severe imbalance, weight loss and high mortality rate  <cit> . peters and colleagues demonstrated that in a mouse model of passive eae, adoptively transferred cxcr5+ th <dig> cells, but not other th cells subsets , induced development of ectopic lymphoid follicle-like structures  in the cns through the upregulation of cxcl <dig> expression and action of th17-specific cytokine il- <dig>  <cit> . based on the latter observation, we hypothesized that mab 5261-muig would predominantly affect th17-mediated disease.

passive eae was induced in female sjl/j mice by adoptive transfer of th <dig> or th <dig> enriched cells differentiated from t cells of donors actively immunized with plp139– <dig>  starting on the day of the adoptive transfer, the animals were treated with 30 mg/kg of the antibodies, intraperitoneally, twice a week for a total of 4 weeks. the mice were scored for the clinical signs of the disease as described in methods. mab 5261-muig significantly reduced the severity of th17-induced eae , but failed to alleviate the symptoms of th1-induced eae , indicating a specific mechanism of disease inhibition that involves th17-mediated pathways. to further confirm the effect of mab 5261-muig on th <dig> cells, we tested this mab in a th17-targeted chemotaxis assay where the antibody inhibited cxcl13-mediated migration of th <dig> cells, without affecting migration of th <dig> cells .figure  <dig>

tolerability of mab 5261-muig and mab  <dig> treatment
in both models, cia and eae, we found mab 5261-muig to be well tolerated, as no anti-drug antibody response  was detected by elisa. treatment regimen of bi-weekly intraperitoneal injections with  <dig>  mg/ml mab 5261-muig typically resulted in steady serum levels of approximately 500 μg/ml of the antibody at study termination .

to evaluate the safety of our human anti-cxcl <dig> antibody, mab  <dig>  we conducted a single-dose toxicology study at ethox international, sts life sciences. sprague dawley rats were injected intravenously with mab  <dig> in doses ranging from  <dig>  to 100 mg/kg. the antibody half-life was dose-dependent with values ranged from  <dig> to 14 days. no toxicity or immunogenicity was observed in any of the treatment groups.

discussion
cxcl <dig> is a homeostatic chemokine that is constitutively expressed in secondary lymphoid tissue and involved in lymphoid organogenesis. in the setting of disease, however, the levels of cxcl <dig> have been shown to significantly increase. in fact, in a number of the autoimmune disorders , cxcl <dig> is considered a biomarker indicative of disease severity.

antibody-based therapeutics targeting chemokine–mediated pathways are promising due to the specificity of their effect and the ability to enhance immune responses through activation of complement-dependent or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity  that might be useful in certain disease states. in recent years, several anti-chemokine antibody therapeutics have emerged and been tested in clinical trials  <cit> . one of them, fully human anti-cxcl <dig> antibody mdx- <dig>  has demonstrated efficacy in phase ii clinical trials involving patients with rheumatoid arthritis  <cit>  and ulcerative colitis  <cit> .

we describe here a novel human anti-human cxcl <dig> antibody, mab  <dig>  whose murine analog, mab 5261-muig, has demonstrated efficacy in two well-characterized mouse models of autoimmunity: cia  and passively and actively induced models of relapsing-remitting eae.

in the model of an established arthritis, the effect of antibody  <dig> was comparable to that of etanercept, a drug routinely prescribed to treat moderate to severe ra. etanercept is a soluble tnf-α receptor fusion protein. although effective in ra, etanercept, as other tnf-α blockers, is an immunosuppressant and is associated with a number of serious side effects   <cit> , thus suggesting a need for safer treatment options, one of which might be an antibody targeting cxcl <dig> 

in the eae model, mab 5261-muig reduced severity of the disease mediated by cxcr5+ th <dig> cells presumably through inhibition of cell migration into the cns. while it has been widely accepted that cns inflammation in ms patients is mediated mainly by the ifn-γ-secreting th <dig> cells, in recent years, th <dig> cells have emerged as major players in ms due to their high pathogenic potential through the production of proinflammatory cytokine il-17a. in addition, as compared to th <dig> cells, th <dig> cells have a higher proliferative capacity, higher expression of activation markers  and adhesion molecules ) required for t cell penetration into the brain, and reduced susceptibility to treg-induced suppression  <cit> . clinically, in patients with relapsing-remitting ms, the frequency of th <dig> cells is significantly elevated in cerebrospinal fluid  as compared to blood; the frequency of th <dig> cells in csf is significantly higher during relapse than in remission, while the frequency of th <dig> cells remains relatively stable  <cit> . moreover, in patients with aggressive ms that were treated with ablative chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the absence of new relapses and inflammatory brain lesions 2 years following treatment was linked to diminished th <dig> and th1/ <dig> cells , but not th <dig> responses, implicating the former t-cell subsets’ involvement in ms pathogenesis  <cit> .

targeting th <dig> cells, therefore, appears to be a reasonable strategy for developing next-generation treatments for ms. in fact, some of the approved ms therapies, including glatiramer acetate  <cit> , fty <dig>  <cit>  and ifn-β  <cit> , are capable of reducing th <dig> responses in both experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models  <cit>  and in patients with multiple sclerosis  <cit> . on the other hand, ustekinumab, an il-12/il- <dig> monoclonal antibody targeting th <dig> differentiation, although well-tolerated, failed to demonstrate efficacy in a phase ii clinical study involving patients with relapsing-remitting ms  <cit> . a monoclonal antibody targeting th <dig> trafficking into the cns, such as the anti-cxcl <dig> antibody described herein, may serve as a more effective strategy to block th <dig> cell-mediated pathologic effects and thereby alleviate disease symptoms associated with ms.

as shown in figure  <dig>  mab 5261-muig significantly inhibited b cell migration into spleens of naïve balb/c mice, while kramer and colleagues recently demonstrated that cxcl <dig> neutralization with mab 5261-muig in a nod mouse model of sjogren’s syndrome caused reduction in salivary gland inflammation by inhibiting b cell recruitment into submandibular gland tissue  <cit> . in an attempt to decipher the mechanism of action of anti-cxcl <dig> antibody in animal models, finch et al.  <cit>  examined the integrity of splenic architecture in balb/c mice immunized with alum-precipitated dnp-ova and treated with rat anti-mouse cxcl <dig> antibody mab  <dig> . they found that anti-cxcl <dig> treatment caused a disruption in splenic follicular structure accompanied by a significant reduction in germinal center frequency. the serum titers of dnp-ova-specific igg and the frequency of the germinal center b cells were not affected by the treatment. similarly, mab 5261-muig caused a decline in the number and size of splenic germinal centers of the c57bl/ <dig> mice immunized with alum-precipitated np-klh , but not a reduction in the frequency of b220+/pnahigh/cd38low gc b cells . while we have not assessed the serum titers of np-specific igg, we did observe a significant decrease in the frequency of np-specific igg1-secreting cells, consistent with the effects reported by arnold et al.  <cit>  in mice with cxcr5-deficient t cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we describe the derivation and functional testing of a novel human anti-human cxcl <dig> antibody, mab  <dig>  and provide its detailed pharmacological characteristics. the antibody binds to human, mouse and cyno cxcl <dig> with an affinity of approximately  <dig> nm. it efficiently and specifically inhibits cxcl13-induced chemotaxis of human and murine b cells as well as hucxcl13-mediated cxcr <dig> receptor endocytosis. importantly, the antibody is non-toxic as revealed by preclinical single-dose rat pk study.

its murine counterpart, mab 5261-muig, created specifically for in vivo preclinical studies, effectively inhibits b and activated t-cell recruitment into secondary lymphoid organs and germinal center formation in mice immunized with thymus-dependent antigen and autoimmune mice. through its effect on the migration of immune cells, mab 5261-muig inhibited progression and severity of relapsing-remitting eae and, specifically, th17-induced eae in sjl mice and alleviated symptoms of arthritis in mice immunized with type ii collagen.

our results, therefore, indicate that cxcl <dig> neutralizing mab  <dig> antibody has potential for treatment of autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis
