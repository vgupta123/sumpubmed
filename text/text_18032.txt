BACKGROUND
in vertebrates cellular immunity is based on antigen recognition by αβ or γδ t cell receptors  chains. although γδ t cells share many functions and features with αβ t cells, they are unique because of their thymic development, their antigen recognition   <cit> , and their tissue distribution. in general γδ t cells show an intermediate phenotype between innate and adaptive immunity, and exhibit a pronounced immunoregulatory function  <cit> . t cell receptor variable domains are assembled during lymphocyte development from v, d, and j segments by vj recombination. in developing t cells, specific molecular mechanisms target the recombinase activity to appropriate tr loci according to the allelic exclusion rule. this recombinase targeting at the level of the substrate locus, is known as recombinational accessibility  <cit> . the enhancer elements are involved in controlling the accessibility since they govern the general accessibility of each locus in vj recombination. deletion of the enhancers abolishes rearrangements in the trb locus and greatly reduces rearrangements in the tra locus  <cit> . in tra/trd and trb loci a tightly correlation has been demonstrated between histone acetylation and vj recombination and a mechanism for coupling enhancer activity with accessibility has been proposed  <cit> .

the percentage of γδ t cells is variable among species. sheep and cattle, as well as swine  <cit> , and chicken  <cit> , are considered "γδ high" species. in young ruminants the circulating γδ t cells account for more than 50% of circulating blood cells, but this percentage decreases to 5% by adulthood  <cit> . on the other hand, in "γδ low" species, like humans and mice, although the proportion of γδ t cells in the blood decreases with age, even before adulthood their percentage is consistently lower than in "γδ high" species. moreover for both "γδ low and high" species γδ t cells can represent up to 50% of the lymphocytes in epithelium-rich tissues, such as the skin, the gut and the reproductive tract  <cit> .

while γδ t cells from humans and mice have been extensively studied in their function, antigen responsiveness and structural organization of the genomic loci coding for the γ and δ chains, less is known in γδ high species. bovine γδ t cells are able to respond to nonpeptidic molecules derived from mycobacteria, including isopentenylpyrophosphate   <cit> . whatever the role of γδ t cells in cellular immunity the mechanisms, which led to a significant increase of these cells in young ruminants and chickens, are still unknown. in sheep, the trg locus has a double chromosomal localization on the 4q <dig>   and 4q <dig>   chromosome bands; the locus is localized on the homologous bands in cattle, goat and river buffalo. only trg <dig> is found within a region of the ovis aries genome which is syntenic with the human region containing the trg locus on chromosome  <dig>  while the trg <dig> locus appears to be unique to ruminants  <cit> . the organisation of loci in their basic structure was determined, each locus consisting of three cassettes composed by one variable , two joining  and one constant  genes lying in the same transcriptional orientation  <cit> .

in humans and mice the structure of the trg locus is peculiar when compared to the other t cell receptor loci, since only a few genes encode γ chains  <cit> , while a repertoire of more than  <dig> genes, distributed in long arrays of v and/or j genes, encodes α and β chains  <cit> .

moreover, in the trg locus a considerably higher number of c genes is found in ruminants, than in other mammalian species: for example, there are only two trgc genes in human  <cit>  and four, of which one is a pseudogene, in mouse  <cit> . it has been proposed  <cit>  that different trgc genes, each possessing unique connecting regions  <cit> , could mediate different cellular responses after the t cell receptor has engaged the antigen. in cattle the expression of specific trgc genes may be restricted to specific lymphocyte t populations  <cit> .

in this study our aims were: i) to determine the overall genomic arrangement of the sheep trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci by assembling their contiguous genomic sequences; ii) to outline the sequence of events that gave rise to the current structural organisation of the two trg loci. closer inspection of the cassettes, each containing the basic v-j-j-c unit, using evidence from dna sequence relationships and repetitive elements insertion allowed us to propose a model highlighting the cassette duplication-driven evolution in bovidae.

RESULTS
overall arrangement of trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci in sheep
t cell receptor gene families exhibit tremendous genetic diversity, not only in the number of genes, but also in the rearrangements used to create protein coding sequences  <cit> . in previous papers we described the entire ovine repertoire of the variable , joining  and constant  ovine genes and their organization in the trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci. the isolation of five trg <dig> bac clones and two trg <dig> bac clones, their sub-cloning in plasmid vectors and the sequencing of their inserts allowed us to obtain contiguous genomic sequences spanning  <dig>  kb for trg <dig>  and  <dig>  kb for trg <dig> .

in the γδ high bovidae lineage, as pointed out by recent phylogenetic results on cattle and sheep variable genes, the complex trg <dig> locus, containing the ancestral v-j-c cassette, contrasts with the more recent trg <dig> locus presumably originated by a translocation event  <cit> . furthermore, an enhanced expression deriving from a coordinated expansion of trdv <dig> subgroup genes of the variable δ repertoire was recently discovered in adult sheep  <cit> .

the availability of the complete sequence of the ovine trg loci allowed us to attempt a reconstruction of the succession of events that shaped their current genomic organization starting from the most likely ancestral locus, and led to the rapid expansion of their copy number. we first analysed the compositional properties  of the sequences obtained and identified tandem and interspersed repeated sequences. the gc content of  <dig> % is almost identical for the two ovine clusters and is consistent with the general observation that sine-rich regions have a high gc content.

the tandem repeats finder program identified  <dig> different tandem repeats in the trg <dig> locus and  <dig> in trg <dig>  repeats vary in monomer length from  <dig> to  <dig> bp for trg <dig> and from  <dig> to  <dig> bp for trg <dig>  and in copy number from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for trg <dig> and from  <dig> to  <dig>  for trg <dig> .

with regard to the interspersed repeated elements, the analysis carried out through the repeat masker program provided the results summarized in additional tables a  and b   and presented in detail in additional tables c and d . the density of total repeats both in trg <dig>  and in trg <dig> , is slightly lower than the density reported for the trg loci of man and mouse  <cit> . sines are the most abundant elements in the ovine loci as in their human  and murine counterpart .

fig.  <dig> shows the overall organization of the ovine trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci. it should be noted that according to an imgt suggestion  as an upgrade to the nomenclature used in previous reports, in the present report, we will use the term "cassette" instead of "cluster" when referring to the "v-j-j-c" units belonging to the sheep and bovine trg loci. fig.  <dig> shows the entire trg <dig> locus, which encompasses three cassettes, trgc <dig>  trgc <dig> and trgc <dig>  named according to the constant genes  <cit>  and following the recommendations of the imgt nomenclature committee. the limit dividing the three cassettes from each other was set at approximately 4– <dig> kb downstream of the last exon of each c gene. similarly fig.  <dig> shows the entire trg <dig> locus, consisting of trgc <dig>  trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes. all trg cassettes lie in the same transcriptional orientation and are closely spaced. in each "v-j-j-c" cassette, the v gene and a j gene rearrange and, after transcription, the v-j is then spliced to the relevant c in mature transcripts  <cit> . the only exception is the trgc <dig>  where the variable v5- <dig> is rearranged with j1- <dig> and/or j1- <dig>  both spliced to c <dig>  <cit> . we detected by rt-pcr the transcripts for all genes belonging to trgc <dig>  <cit> , including the trgv10- <dig> gene  <cit> , which contains a premature stop codon in exon  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore we identified the v11- <dig> gene, never before described, which was deposited . v11- <dig> belongs to the trgc <dig> 5' region, presents 79% nucleotidic similarity with the functional human counterpart trgv <dig> , has a premature stop codon and has never been found transcribed. all c-proximal  and c-distal  j genes have been found transcribed in adult and foetus with the only exception of the j5- <dig>  located in the middle  <cit> . j3- <dig>  wrongly previously reported as a vestigial form  <cit> , presents the fvngikf motif and a premature stop codon at 3' end of coding region. with regard to the c genes, it should be noted that ex <dig>  corresponding to the disulfide-linked constant domain, and ex <dig>  corresponding to the transmembrane and cytoplasmatic domains, are similar in length in all genes. conversely, the ex2a, ex2b and ex2c exons, which encode the connecting region, differ between c genes both in number and length . the only peculiar feature being c <dig> gene, where the presence of only the first three codons in ex2b has been demonstrated  <cit> .

comparison of trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci in bovidae
figs.  <dig> and  <dig> show the dotplot matrixes comparing the sequence of each ovine locus against itself. as expected for loci consisting of a series of clusters of correlated genes, the matrixes show numerous homologous regions of various sizes. the most continuous block of similarity exists between the j-c regions of the trg cassettes and the longest similarity block starting from v and ending in c regions is found at the diagonal concerning trgc <dig> vs. trgc <dig> in figure  <dig>  in figure  <dig> the trgc <dig> vs. trgc <dig> similarity extends to the v regions while the 5' region of the trgc <dig> cassette, characterized by the presence of six v genes, does not show similarity with any other region of the entire locus, except partially with itself. this is also true for the single v gene  belonging to trgc <dig> cassette in the trg <dig> locus.

all the genes and intergenic regions of the trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> blocks, feature high identity levels ; the region of similarity is largely uninterrupted and the duplicated blocks appear superimposed "end to end". thus the duplication that originated the trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> units is likely to have occurred very recently. duplication events in the genomic regions containing variable genes only occurred in the trg <dig> locus, giving origin to three  and  <dig>  genes in the trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes respectively . we have compared cattle contiguous sequences  ,   and    <cit>  vs. the sheep trg <dig> and vs. the sheep trg <dig> loci. considering trg <dig>  there are  <dig> genes in the trgc <dig> cassette in bovine but only  <dig> in ovine. the trg <dig> sequences from cattle and sheep are superimposable with the following exception: a) there is a deletion of exons 2b and 2c in ovine trgc <dig> ; b) there are two sequence gaps in the intergenic region that is one between trgv5- <dig> and trgj2- <dig> and another one from the trgv6- <dig> exonic region to trgj6- <dig>  due to two trgv-j rearrangements observed in the bovine trg <dig>   <cit> ; c) there are two trgv <dig> genes in bovine but only one in ovine.

athe percentages have been calculated as weighted average of identity values obtained by blastz algorithm  on the conserved regions.

fig.  <dig> shows the dotplot matrix comparing the sequences of trg <dig> vs. trg <dig> ovine loci. the conservation of the j-j-c region of each cassette, starting from the distal j gene and ending at 3' of the c gene, is quite straightforward. also the absence of similarity diagonals is evident for the v genes of the trgc <dig> cassette vs. all other vs of the trg <dig> locus and for the single trgv6- <dig> gene of trgc <dig> cassette vs. all the other v of the trg <dig> locus. instead in the comparison of trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes vs. trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes the conservation of similarity is extended to the whole block from the 5' region of the trgv9- <dig> gene up to 3' of the c <dig> gene. therefore the trgv5- <dig> and trgv5- <dig> genes seem to be equally correlated to trgv8- <dig>  trgv2- <dig>  trgv9- <dig> and trgv <dig> genes of the trg <dig> locus. the identity percentages between similarity regions, ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb and containing variable genes, are shown in table  <dig>  the analysis of the matrix gives an idea of the duplicative mechanisms, which appear to have involved either the entire v-j-j-c unit, as in the trg <dig> locus or single v genes  as in the trgc <dig> cassette of trg <dig> locus. the relationship between the v genes belonging to trgc <dig> and those belonging to the remaining cassettes will be discussed further below. it must be observed that the region at 5' of the trgv5- <dig> gene and at 3' of c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> genes of the trg <dig> locus share high identity percentage with the regions located at 3' of c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> genes and with the region at 5' of trgv2- <dig> and trgv9- <dig> genes of the trg <dig> locus.

fig.  <dig> highlights in each locus the conservation in similarity and in length of the intergenic regions inclusive of the c gene of a cassette and the v gene of the next cassette, the only difference lying in the c <dig> – v8- <dig> region that is rich in repeated elements, which are the main cause of its peculiar behaviour in the matrix. these c-v intergenic regions are characterized by the presence of a sequence similar to the only single copy of the trg locus enhancer localized at 3' of the human c <dig> gene  <cit>  . from now on this sequence will be referred to as the enhancer-like sequence. in the trg <dig> locus the enhancer-like sequence is present in four copies distributed either immediately downstream of the c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> genes or immediately upstream of trgv5- <dig>  the trg <dig> locus contains five copies of the enhancer-like sequence, localized immediately downstream of the c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> genes or immediately upstream of trgv2- <dig> and trgv9- <dig>  fig.  <dig> shows a phylogram obtained from the alignment of a common region about  <dig> bp long of eight of the nine enhancer-like sequences analyzed. the division of the phylogram in three parts  is useful to understand the evolutionary relationship of the analyzed sequences. the upper part  features the human enhancer element. the middle part  features a cluster with including the sheep enhancer-like sequences located at the 5' end of trgv5- <dig>  and the sequences at the 3' end of c <dig> and c <dig> constant genes, which derive from the most recent duplications. the lower part  refers to a cluster containing both the sheep enhancer-like sequences at the 3' end of the oldest c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> and at 5' end of trgv2- <dig>  and trgv9- <dig> .

relationships between the variable genes of trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci
the total lack of similarity of the v genes of the trgc <dig> cassette and the single v gene of the trgc <dig> cassette with all the remaining vs  suggests their more ancient origin, in accord with the phylogenetic results obtained, which highlighted the existence of an ancient trgc <dig> cassette in cattle and sheep  <cit> . human/mouse/bovidae comparison data presented in the last subsection of results and discussion support this "evolutionary freezing" which appears to have only concerned the genomic regions containing the v genes involved in antigen recognition, excluding them from the subsequent duplications of bovidae trg loci. on the other hand, similarities were found between v genes belonging to the trgc <dig>  trgc <dig>  trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes. we used several features of the dot plot to help deduce the nature of the duplication events that occurred.

the areas of high similarity related to the trgv8- <dig>  trgv2- <dig>  trgv9- <dig> and trgv <dig> genes , stretching from 5' to 3' ends , may help define the most probable duplicative events that occurred in the trgc <dig> v region. in particular:

i) it is clear that trgv2- <dig> and trgv9- <dig> originated through an extended duplication that mostly concerned their 5', where the similarity region appears a little fragmented in the matrix.

ii) trgv <dig> shows in its upstream position a short similarity region shared with trgv8- <dig>  but absent in trgv2- <dig> and trgv9- <dig> ; the same upstream region is present, though less expanded, in trgv8- <dig> and trgv <dig> vs. trgv5- <dig>  but is lost in trgv8- <dig> and trgv <dig> vs. trgv5- <dig> .

considering the succession of evolutive events proposed in previous reports  <cit>   and the similarities highlighted in the previous point ii, we can hypothesize that the duplication of the entire trgc <dig> cassette  originated trgc <dig> . this hypothesis is in agreement with the data on the distribution of the repeated elements shown in table  <dig>  since trgv8- <dig> shares with trgv <dig> six out of nine elements in 5'v.

a type of repeat as reported in repeatmasker output file.  indicates the opposite orientation of the repeat. b repeat position. jd e jp signify respectively the distal or the proximal j segments with respect to the c gene of each cassette. the cassette-specific j-c intergenic regions include the sequence spanning from 5' of distal j segment and 3' of c gene  for each trgc cassette.

in consideration of point i) and of data in fig.  <dig>  we can therefore hypothesize that trgv2- <dig>  was initially generated by the duplication of a genomic region including the 3' end of c <dig> gene, the trgv <dig> gene and a small portion at its 3' end, while the other gene is assumed to have originated subsequently by duplication of a region including the newly formed one. it is not possible to unequivocally establish the order of events that originated the trgv2- <dig> and trgv9- <dig> genes, whether trgv2- <dig>  trgv9- <dig> or trgv9- <dig>  trgv2- <dig>  moreover, the identity data  indicates a higher resemblance of trgv <dig> with trgv9- <dig> than with trgv8- <dig> or trgv2- <dig> . in addition the 3' region of trgv <dig> compared to trgv9- <dig> features 80% identity, which is higher than the identity with the corresponding trgv2- <dig> region  . as mentioned above, the comparison of identity percentages presented  does not highlight a significantly higher identity for any gene pair, the only exceptions being trgv5-l and trgv5- <dig> identity values vs. trgv <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively suggesting their possible origin from this gene.

evolution of trgj blocks in bovidae
the results obtained so far are in accordance with previously obtained comparative data on bovidae and human germline promoters located at the 5' of each c-distal j  gene. this data strongly supports a key role of such promoters in determining local accessibility to the site-specific recombinational machinery  <cit> . figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  generated using the mvista program, show the comparison of each trgj block with the others.

the mvista program provides a multi-alignment of nucleotide sequences and highlights their local similarity regions in the compared genomic regions. indeed, since the insertion of a mobile element in a given position of the genome is a rather unique event, the presence in the same genomic position in different homologous regions can be used to infer a common origin  <cit> . the comparative analysis of the trgj blocks, was particularly useful to formulate a plausible model of the formation and evolution of the ovine trg loci. the analysis was conducted considering three different parameters: 1) the regions featuring a similarity higher than 70% shared by coding and non coding regions obtained by multialigned trgj blocks ; 2) the repeated elements shared by the six cassettes displayed in table  <dig> and fig. 9; 3) the similarity values obtained from comparing all the trgj regions using the mvista program .

by looking at the so-called "peaks and valleys" mvista graphs obtained by comparison of each trgj block with all the others, the following considerations can be made: i) a high similarity is preserved between the regions right uphill and downstream of the c-distant j  ; ii) the region including the j5- <dig> between j5- <dig> and j5- <dig> , presents a similarity peak higher than 70% only in the alignment trgj <dig> vs. trgj <dig> and vice versa ; iii) the region immediately at 5' of the c-proximal j  gene in each unit seems to be similar in trgj <dig>  trgj <dig>  trgj <dig>  trgj <dig> and trgj <dig> and different in trgj <dig> ; these regions immediately at 5'of each jp gene have become homogeneous in all cassettes, with the exception of trgj <dig>  maybe for one or more gene conversion events that initially involved only trgj <dig> and trgj <dig> blocks; iv) the trgj <dig> block, more significantly, and the trgj <dig> block would seem to be deleted in 3' jp region .

in consideration of the above observations, the trgj blocks can be clearly sub-divided into two groups based on their "resemblance" and sharing of repeated elements. some of these have provided valuable information suggesting the most likely succession of events.

one group consists of the trgj <dig> and trgj <dig> , since these two blocks share repeats r <dig> e r <dig> that the remaining four blocks lack. r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> are shared by all blocks. finally, r <dig> is present in all blocks except trgj <dig>  while r <dig>  is always present except in trgj <dig>  for these two repeats, we can hypothesize that a rearrangement, which could have generated the third j in trgj <dig>  may have obscured their phylogenetic origin. the region including the j5- <dig> gene was subsequently lost in all cassettes except trgc <dig>  where only residual sequences from the region remain . a series of specific shared repeats  substantiate the scenario depicted in the next section: r <dig> is shared only by trgj <dig> and trgj <dig>  just like r <dig> is shared by trgj <dig> and trgj <dig>  r <dig> keeps its sharing starting from trgj <dig>  up to trgj <dig>  trgj <dig> and trgj <dig>  while r <dig> and r <dig> are shared by trgj <dig>  trgj <dig> and trgj <dig>  the most recent shared insertions, present only in blocks trgj <dig> and trgj <dig>  are r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  this latter data, together with the similarities of the trgv <dig> vs. trgv5- <dig> rather than of trgv <dig> vs. trgv5- <dig>  as mentioned above in the analysis ii) of the matrix in fig.  <dig> and the set of data presented in fig.  <dig>  led us to assume the origin of cassette trgc <dig> by duplication of cassette trgc <dig> 

concerning the shared repeats in genomic regions relating to the c genes, the parameter of the common repeats may be used only in the regions immediately at 5', in i intron  and immediately at 3' of the coding segment . repeated gene conversion, duplication and deletion events concerning exons ii have probably obscured the evolutive relationship of these genes. however, the phylogenetic analysis conducted only on the coding regions of c genes  <cit>  supports the succession of events hypothesized in the evolutionary scenario proposed in fig.  <dig> 

a model for the evolution of the v-j-j-c cassettes in ovine trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci
the distribution of the "similarity peaks"  obtained through the mvista program by comparing each trjg block against all the others  as well as evidence from the presence or absence of repeated elements in different trjg blocks  and from similarity percentages between all trjg blocks  provided us the basis to propose a model for the formation of sheep trg loci, although multiple gene conversion events, which complicate this analysis, have almost certainly occurred. the model will be discussed by referring in turn to each numbered panel of fig.  <dig>  we propose that after the duplication of a minimum ancestral cassette consisting of one v, three js and one c genes, the ancestral trg locus consisted of two cassettes, which had the repeated elements r <dig> and r <dig> in common and probably were the forerunners of the trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes. the ancestral cassette likely possessed three j genes, of which the central one was subsequently lost in the trgc <dig> cassette by a deletion event . this hypothesis is supported by the phylogenetic tree of the j genes, where the bootstrap value close to 85% indicates a clear subdivision of human and sheep sequences into two main groups. a third minor group consists of chicken j genes, human jp and sheep j5- <dig>  <cit> . concerning the six v genes of the trgc <dig> cassette, which present a low level of similarity with the v genes of the trgc <dig>  trgc <dig>  trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes, we hypothesize that they are the result of ancestral duplicative events which only involved v genes presumably in the same manner as occurred in the human locus . the specific sharing of repeats and the dot plot comparison analysis substantiate our scenario that proposes  the origin of the trgc <dig>  cassette from trgc <dig> . in addition, we postulate the occurrence of a deletion of the region including the centrally positioned trgj5- <dig> gene  as well as gene conversion events that made the regions immediately to 5' of the jp in trgc <dig> more similar to the corresponding one of trgc <dig>  than to the one of trgc <dig>  panel  <dig> shows the origin of trgc <dig>  from a duplication of trgc <dig>  insertion of repeats r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  shared by trgv8- <dig> and trgv <dig> , and repeat r <dig> found in the trgj <dig> and trgj <dig> blocks , most probably occurred at this stage.

panel  <dig> of fig.  <dig> hypothesizes a duplication of the region containing the 3'c <dig> enhancer-like sequence inclusive of trgv <dig> that originated trgv2- <dig> and also shows the origin of the trgc <dig> cassette by a duplication of the trgc <dig> cassette. both events are proposed to have occurred at this stage because repeats r <dig> and r <dig>  shared by trgv2- <dig>  trgv <dig>  trgv5- <dig> and trgv5- <dig> are likely to have been inserted at the same time. panel  <dig> shows a second-step duplication of the trgv2- <dig> region originating trgv9- <dig>  repeat r <dig>  which is shared by trgv2- <dig> and trgv9- <dig> only, could have been inserted at this time. the analysis of the repeats and of the phylogenetic tree of fig.  <dig> favours a more recent origin of trgv9- <dig> than trgv2- <dig>  however, this is in conflict with the dot plot analysis shown in fig.  <dig>  which indicates that trgv9- <dig>  in contrast to trgv2- <dig> originated directly from trgv <dig> or from a gene conversion event. panel  <dig> also shows the origin of the trgc <dig> cassette depicted in panel  <dig> by duplication of the entire trgc <dig> 

this reconstruction of the sequence of ancient duplications events illustrated in fig.  <dig> is supported not only by the similarity levels observed  but also by the observed concordances in the distribution of the repeated elements: r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> are shared by all six trgj blocks; repeat r <dig> is trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> specific; repeat r <dig> is trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> specific, r <dig> and r <dig> are trgc <dig>  trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> specific, and finally r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  shared by trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes, seem to have been the last inserted in the trg locus. a further duplication event concerning the 3'c <dig> enhancer-like sequence region  is proposed to have originated a region containing two adjoining enhancer-like sequences following the genesis of the six cassettes. the trg <dig> locus is assumed to have later originated by a chromosomal rearrangement that probably occurred in the region where two-adjoining enhancer sequences were located at the 3' of the c <dig> gene and at the 5' of the trgv5- <dig> gene respectively . as a result, a translocation event removed the part of the locus consisting of trgc <dig>  trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes from the 4q <dig>  band taking it to the 4q <dig>  band.

there is no doubt that some aspects of the model may be incorrect, especially because some evolutive relationships might may have been obscured by gene conversion. however, the model highlights the genetic "fluidity" of this region, that led to a strikingly variable and complex genetic locus in bovidae.

comparison of human, murine and bovidae trg loci
when comparing the sheep genomic organization described above to the human trg locus  <cit> , we find that in bovidae  a significant number of duplicative events has led to a substantial increase in the number of v, j and c genes, to the point of colonizing an additional region of chromosome  <dig>  while in man duplications are considerable only in the region of v genes. the human trg locus spans  <dig> kb and features in its 5' region fourteen variable genes, of which only six are functional, grouped into six subgroups according to the identity values  <cit> .

pipmaker dotplot matrixes of the ovine trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci, against the human trg locus display two identity diagonals in line with the j-c regions of each ovine cassette . this result reflects the organisation of the two j-c regions duplicated in tandem in man, which are superimposed "end to end": the first consists of three j genes  and one c gene  while the second consist of two j genes  and one c gene , all functional. in both matrixes, the longest diagonals refer to block jp2-j2-c <dig>  the apparent greater length is due to the small diagonals located downstream of each ovine c and corresponding to the single human enhancer sequence. the nine variable genes of the human trgv <dig> subgroup, all located at 5' of the locus, include three pseudogenes  and one orf   <cit> , and display short similarity traits, only in the coding part against both the v genes of trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes and those of trgc <dig> and trgc <dig>  the human functional trgv <dig> displays similarity only with trgv11- <dig> of trgc <dig>  while trgv <dig> and trgv <dig>  and trgvb  recognize the areas corresponding to trgv3- <dig>  trgv3- <dig> and trgv <dig>  finally, the single trgva  features one similarity diagonal including both its coding and non-coding parts against trgv6- <dig> of trgc <dig>  . when looking at the human vs. bovidae matrixes, the importance that the j-j-c blocks must have had during the evolution of these loci emerges clearly. indeed, these regions, by preserving their intergenic portions, behave quite differently than other regions of the same locus, as for example those including the v genes, for which a strong intra-species and inter-species sequence divergence has been reported  <cit> . the phylogenetic analyses of the j genes  <cit>  are in full agreement with this sort of preservation of a spatial constriction in the j-c regions, at least when considering human and bovidae species comparison.

the genomic organisation of the murine trg locus   <cit>  is apparently similar to that of bovidae, as it features four v-j-c cassettes for a total length of about  <dig> kb on chromosome  <dig>  the trgc <dig> cassette, which correlates to human, has four v genes, all of which are functional, one j gene  and one c gene   <cit>  ; the trgc <dig>  trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes all consist of one v, one j and one c, which are non functional in trgc <dig> and display a transcriptional orientation inverted with respect to the other three cassettes in trgc <dig>  a sequence putatively serving as an enhancer is found downstream of each c gene. however, the resemblance to the bovidae genomic organisation is only apparent because in pipmaker dotplot matrices obtained by comparison of each sheep trg locus with the murine trg <dig> cassette, only short similarity traits corresponding to exonic regions are evident. in the three gray rectangles in particular, three spots are indicated, which correspond to the j gene and to the first and last exon of the constant genes, respectively . the murine trgv <dig> gene recognizes all the v genes of trgc <dig> and trgc <dig> cassettes . on the other hand, the murine trgv <dig> is recognized by trgv3- <dig>  trgv3- <dig> and trgv <dig> while murine trgv <dig> and trgv <dig> are recognized by trgv10- <dig> and trgv <dig>  respectively . as regards the matrix obtained by comparison of the ovine trg <dig> locus vs. the murine trg <dig> cassette, only murine trgv <dig> recognizes trgv5- <dig> and trgv5- <dig>  respectively . the similarity relationship between v genes in a three species comparison  highlights the absence in the murine locus of the trgva and trgv <dig> human genes and the ovine trgv6- <dig> and trgv11- <dig> genes, and the absence of ovine trgv10- <dig> and trgv <dig> and murine trgv <dig> and trgv <dig> genes in the human locus. the human/murine/bovidae comparison revealed that the v genes in the trgc <dig> cassette are highly related across species and lie in a syntenic region, indicating that this cassette existed before the primate – rodent – artiodactyl lineages diverged.

CONCLUSIONS
the main objective of this study was to focus on the evolutionary history of the two trg loci in bovidae  as compared to the single human locus. the contiguous genomic sequence has allowed us to define the genomic structure of the sheep trg <dig> and trg <dig> loci that emphasises the peculiarity of the organization of the bovidae loci in cassettes, each containing the basic v-j-j-c unit; on the other hand, the human trg locus features duplicated j-c genes separated from the set of v genes  <cit> . the analysis of the dot plot similarity matrix comparing the two sheep loci allowed us to propose an evolutionary model explaining the origin of two paralogous regions in chromosome  <dig> of bovidae. evidence from concordant insertions of repetitive elements strongly supports the interaction of the j-j-c regions in driving the sequence of duplicative events. j-j-c regions are delimited at their 5' end by promoters for germline transcription containing stat motifs, which control the local recombinational accessibility  <cit>  and at their 3' end by enhancer-like elements, which govern the general recombinational accessibility. the phylogenetic conservation of the eight enhancer-like elements found in sheep compared with the single copy present in the human indicates that they play a key role in the functional organization of the bovidae trg loci. our proposed model suggests that only duplicated entire j-j-c regions, which possessed an enhancer-like element at their 3' end, and at least one variable gene at their 5' end, were selected and fixed as functional cassettes. requirements related to immunoprotective functions, which include mechanisms establishing a first defensive barrier in the digestive tract of ruminant animals, are likely to have induced a sort of genomic fluidity of this region favouring its evolution by reiterated duplications. interspecies comparison of trg loci reveals that bovidae and human loci, although apparently not correlated in general structure, share extensive colinearity and high similarity levels in the regulatory and intergenic as well as in the coding regions. on the other hand, bovidae and murine trg loci, although almost identical in genomic structure, show significant similarity only in the genic sequences. studies in other ruminant families will be needed to further clarify evolutionary events and answer questions regarding how genetic fluidity is generated in genomic loci determining "γδ high" condition. we suggest that an extended phylogenetic analysis comparing ovine-bovine sequences with other bovid species might provide further insight into the evolutionary history of the trg locus in artiodactyls and mammals in general, and provide some clues to support functional studies through phylogenetic footprinting.
