BACKGROUND
the geminiviridae family comprises a large and diverse group of viruses that infect a wide range of important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crop species and cause significant yield losses  <cit> . viral pathogenesis depends on a series of interactions between virus, host and insect vector. as very few viral proteins are encoded by geminiviruses, they rely, in large part, on the replication and transcription machinery of the host. one consequence of this host dependence is that geminiviruses are useful models for providing novel insights into the control of both plant and animal dna replication and transcription.

the circular single-stranded dna  genome of geminiviruses is amplified in the nuclei of infected cells by rolling circle  and recombination-dependent  replication using cellular dna polymerases  <cit> . the resulting double-stranded dna replicative forms  are used as template for generation of viral transcripts by host rna polymerase ii. geminiviruses produce small multifunctional proteins to compensate for a limited coding capacity. for example, begomoviruses including cabbage leaf curl  and tomato golden mosaic  virus, code for a pathogenicity protein, ac <dig> , that modulates metabolism  <cit> , regulates transcription  <cit>  and suppresses rna silencing  <cit> .figure  <dig>

ac <dig>  is required for expression of the coat protein  and br <dig> movement protein genes of both calcuv and tgmv  <cit> . it has been shown that ac <dig> is capable of inducing cp expression through two distinct and independent mechanisms. in mesophyll cells ac <dig> activates the cp promoter, but in vascular tissue ac <dig> acts to derepress the promoter  <cit> . distinct sequences mediate activation and derepression by ac <dig>  sequences required for activation are located within the common region upstream of the cp transcription start site  <cit> , whereas sequences required for repression are located  <dig>  to  <dig>  kbp upstream of cp transcription start site  <cit> . among begomoviruses, the transcription function of ac <dig> is not virus specific as both calcuv or tgmv ac <dig> proteins can transactivate the tgmv coat protein  promoter  <cit> .

ac <dig> does not appear to be a canonical transcription factor as it does not bind dsdna efficiently and appears to be targeted to responsive promoters via protein-protein interactions with cellular factors. a recent study has identified a plant specific dna binding protein, peapod <dig> , that specifically binds to sequences known to mediate activation of the cp promoter of calcuv and tgmv in mesophyll cells  <cit> . if ac <dig> is targeted to responsive promoters via protein:protein interactions, we would predict that these interactions will in turn lead to activation of host genes important for pathogenesis. an indirect promoter targeting strategy, via ac2-host dsdna binding protein interactions, might provide the opportunity for geminiviruses to alter host gene expression and in turn, reprogram the host to support virus infection. one finding that supports this idea is that ac <dig> can transactivate cp promoter-reporter transgenes integrated into cellular chromosomes  <cit> , indicating that ac <dig> can gain access to the host chromosome.

the transcription function of ac <dig> is dependent on the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids  <cit> , which contains an acidic activation domain . ac <dig> also exhibits transcription-independent functions involving interactions with different cellular proteins involved in rna silencing suppression and modulation of metabolism, mediated through sequences lacking the activation domain . the l2/c <dig> homolog of curtoviruses , including beet curly top  and spinach curly top  virus, share limited sequence homology with calcuv ac <dig> and lack any semblance of a transcriptional activation domain  <cit> . despite the limited homology, curtovirus c <dig> protein does suppress rna silencing and modulate metabolism, but does not regulate transcription  <cit> . the tgmv ac <dig>  bctv c <dig> and sctv c <dig> proteins have been shown to interact with snrk <dig> ; an arabidopsis snf <dig> related protein kinase   <cit> . the consequence of this interaction is inhibition of kinase activity. expression of an antisense snrk <dig>  transgene in nicotiana benthamiana plants leads to increased susceptibility to infection  <cit> . the snrk <dig> protein kinases play an important role in regulating energy balance in eukayotes and are members of a conserved family of protein kinases  <cit> .

related to this interaction, ac <dig> and c <dig>  <cit>  also interact with and inactivate adenosine kinase . evidence that adenosine kinase activity is reduced in virus-infected tissue and in transgenic plants expressing ac2/c <dig>  <cit> , and that adk-deficient plants display silencing defects  <cit> , supports a link between silencing suppression by ac2/c <dig>  adk and methylation. recent evidence indicates that the silencing suppression activity of geminivirus ac2/c <dig> proteins is a consequence of adk inactivation. this is supported by results demonstrating that the ability of these proteins to suppress transcriptional gene silencing is accomplished by inhibition of adk, which results in interference with methylation  <cit> .

a link between adk and snrk <dig>  is provided by evidence that snrk <dig> kinases are known to be activated upon binding of 5′-amp  <cit> , and adk phosphorylates adenosine producing 5′-amp  <cit> . thus, ac <dig> and c <dig> may interact with and inactivate both snrk <dig>  and adk to prevent snrk1-mediated metabolic  responses that could enhance resistance to geminivirus infection  <cit> . this underscores the importance of snrk1-mediated responses to host defense, but exactly how suppression of these responses leads to suppression of host defenses, specifically the consequence for host gene expression, has not been examined. the complex interactions and functions of geminivirus ac <dig> in regulating transcription and suppressing host defense mechanisms warrants the need to further investigate the host genes that respond to geminivirus ac <dig> protein during an infection.

some microarray profiling of genome-wide changes in the transcriptome in response to geminivirus infection has been performed  <cit> . however, the asynchronous nature of an infection causes significant difficulties in determining host genes responsive to a single viral gene product. to overcome these difficulties we chose to analyze global changes in gene expression in response to the effects of a single gene, ac <dig>  a previous study has been performed using mungbean yellow mosaic virus and african cassava mosaic virus ac <dig> proteins  <cit> . in these studies, rna profiling was performed in arabidopsis protoplasts and so we chose to use a whole plant infusion assay for arabidopsis  <cit> . the focus of this study was to identify changes in host gene expression induced by the transcription-dependent function of the viral ac <dig> protein, and induced by the interaction of ac <dig> with snrk <dig>  we identified large-scale changes in host gene expression in both cases. further, computational analysis identified potential regulatory networks that respond to the two functions of ac <dig>  lastly, we validated the response of the top hits within these networks.

RESULTS
expression profiling of calcuv ac <dig>  ac21- <dig>  sctv c <dig> and assnrk <dig>  in infiltrated arabidopsis plants
for these experiments we used full length and truncated versions of the ac <dig> gene from calcuv, and the full-length c <dig> gene from sctv , as both viruses are known to cause an infection in arabidopsis. snrk <dig>  is an endogenous arabidopsis gene, which interacts with both ac <dig> and c <dig>  and expression of antisense  snrk <dig>  increases the susceptibility of plants to infection  <cit> . we monitored the expression of calcuv ac <dig>  ac21- <dig>  sctv c <dig>  assnrk <dig>  and an empty plasmid vector control  over three days to determine the time at which rna capable of expressing each gene could be detected. total rna was isolated from whole arabidopsis plants at one to three days post-infusion  with agrobacterium cultures containing each dna. transcription directed by each construct was confirmed by rt-pcr analysis and resulting cdna products subjected to dna gel blot hybridization analysis using specific probes. in all cases specific cdna products of the predicted size were detected in samples at one, two and three days, post-infusion . as it was expected that protein and subsequent changes in host gene expression would be detectable at these time points, we used rna isolated one and two days dpi. in addition, at these time points no phenotypic effects were observed in the arabidopsis plants. thus, these time points could be more representative of early events rather than late time points where a phenotype, such as senescence, represents the end of a signaling response. for the microarray analysis, arabidopsis plants were vacuum infiltrated with agrobacterium capable of expressing each of the constructs along with a vector control  to eliminate effects due to agrobacterium infection. total rna was isolated from four individual plants, one and two dpi, for three independent sets of plants infused with the different constructs. this results in three independent samples per treatment per time point. total rna from the samples was converted into crna, hybridized to the arabidopsis ath <dig> genome array, processed and scanned in parallel. raw intensity data was pre-processed and normalized using the robust multi-array average  procedure in matlab bioinformatics toolbox. differentially expressed genes between experimental samples and controls were detected using two-sample t-tests with a p-value of  <dig>  as the cutoff. overall, the variability of the assay is within reasonable range and expected. the average pearson correlation coefficient  between biological replicates is  <dig>  and the average pcc between the vector controls is slightly smaller,  <dig> .

differential expression of genes responding to calcuv ac2
one of the main goals of this study was to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to the trancriptional activation function of ac <dig>  to do this we compared the transcriptome in arabidopsis leaves expressing full-length ac <dig>  or a truncated ac <dig> , lacking the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids containing the acidic activation domain  at one and two dpi . we observed  <dig> genes that were specifically up-regulated by full length ac <dig> protein at one dpi and  <dig> at two dpi . for genes that were down-regulated, a total of  <dig> genes specifically responded to full length ac <dig> protein at one dpi, and  <dig> at two dpi. as the difference between the two proteins is the presence of the c-terminal activation domain in the full length protein we conclude that these potentially represent genes differentially regulated in response to the transcription function of ac <dig> figure  <dig>

in samples over expressing a truncated ac <dig> protein we detected  <dig> and  <dig> genes specifically up-regulated at one dpi and two dpi respectively. for genes specifically down regulated by the truncated ac <dig> protein,  <dig> were detected at one dpi and  <dig> at two dpi. given that the truncated ac <dig> protein lacks the c-terminal activation domain, we conclude that these may represent genes differentially regulated in response to the known interactions of ac <dig> with the cellular proteins snrk <dig>  and/or adk  <cit> . it is of course possible that there are additional, hitherto unknown, functions within the ac <dig> protein that could result in differential gene expression.

interestingly, we observed that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated in arabidopsis leaves expressing both full length and truncated ac <dig> protein at one dpi and two dpi respectively. in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in leaves expressing both full length and truncated ac <dig> protein at one and two dpi respectively . we would expect these genes to be differentially regulated in response to the interaction with snrk <dig>  and/or adk, given that these are functions common to both full-length and truncated ac <dig> protein.

to further analyze the genes where expression was differentially regulated in response to the transcription function of ac <dig>  we made a comparison to microarray data from arabidopsis plants infected with calcuv  <cit> . we observed a number of genes in our study that were also detected during calcuv infection . of the genes up-regulated by full-length ac <dig> and calcuv-infection at two dpi, several that had functions related to rna metabolism, including a dea-box rna helicase  and argonaute  <dig>  . it is interesting that ago <dig>  which binds viral sirnas and regulates innate immunity against viral infection, is up-regulated in response to ac <dig> and that ac <dig> suppresses rna silencing. we also detected an rna-dependent rna polymerse gene  , which functions in amplification of the rna silencing signal, that was down-regulated in response to both ac <dig> and calcuv-infection at one dpi. thus, it is possible that ac <dig> acts as an effector that is recognized by the plant, activating the innate immune response, and then acts to overcome rna silencing. the number of genes shared between both experimental data sets were realtively small and no statistical significance was measured. however, we observed that the number of genes shared between the two data sets increased three to four-fold at two dpi . differences observed between the two experimental data sets may be reflective of the different time scales being used in each experiment. the profiling study for calcuv was performed at 12 days post infection, in comparison to this study where profiling was performed one and two days after infusion. in addition this study used agroinfiltration where ac <dig> would be expressed in all cell types, in comparison to a systemic infection where a small number of phloem cells actually contain virus  <cit> . despite this, the observation that some ac2-responsive genes are differentially regulated during virus infection, gives added confidence that we are analyzing genes relavant to viral infection.

functional categorization of genes differentially regulated in response to the transcription function of calcuv ac2
we have focused our analysis on those genes that were differentially regulated specifically in response to full-length ac <dig>  this is interpreted to represent, at least in part, those genes differentially regulated in response to the transcriptional activation domain of full length ac <dig> protein. to categorize these genes by biological process we used the david bioinformatics resource . most of the go biological process categories were represented among the significant genes, but several categories were significantly enriched as compared to the arabidopsis genome as a whole. specifically, genes in the categories of dna/rna metabolism, transcription, response to stress, protein metabolism, signal transduction, cell organization and biogenesis, transport and electron transport or energy pathways were enriched at day one and day two .

network analysis of genes differentially regulated in response to full length ac2
to allow us to more specifically focus on genes co-regulated in response to the transcription function of the ac <dig> protein we performed a network analysis. to this end, we overlayed these genes to a whole-genome co-expression network derived from more than  <dig> arabidopsis affymetrix microarray experiments, where two genes are connected by an edge if their expression levels are highly correlated across all experimental conditions . our previous results showed that the connections between genes indeed suggest functional associations, and that the whole network contains many relatively independent, densely connected, sub-networks that contain co-regulated functional gene modules  <cit> . interestingly, while most of the full length ac2-specific genes do not have direct connections to other ac <dig> responsive genes, indicating that ac <dig> regulates diverse functional processes, a small fraction of them are tightly linked to each other, resulting in dense sub-networks that may represent the core functional modules regulated by the transcription function of full length ac <dig> 

of the  <dig> unique genes that were up regulated in response to full length ac <dig> at one dpi, five sub-networks consisting of between four and eight highly connected genes were identified . within these, it is interesting to note that two sub-networks  contained genes having functions associated with the chloroplast . alterations of the chloroplast transcriptome may be of interest to geminivirus infections given that chloroplasts contain components of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid biosynthetic pathways, which elicit defense responses to viral and bacterial pathogens  <cit> . for example, two highly linked genes in sub-network i, translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts  <dig>  and translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts 75-iii , are associated with complexes involved in protein import into chloroplasts. there appears to be two systems driving protein import into the chloroplast stroma, both of which utilize heat shock proteins as the motor  <cit> . one system utilizes heat shock cognate 70 kda protein , as part of the chloroplast translocon for general import, and is of potential relevance for geminivirus infections. it has been recently determined that stromules  containing cphsc70- <dig> are induced in plants infected with abutilon mosaic virus   <cit> . alteration of plastid structures and stromule biogenesis is known to occur during viral infection, and also relevant to rna-virus infections  <cit> . thus, it has been suggested that this may be important for intra- and intercellular movement of geminiviruses, given the interaction between cphsc70- <dig> and the abmv movement protein  <cit> . it is also worth noting that stromule formation is strongly induced in plants responding to pathogen infection, and that chloroplast structure may undergo alterations following pathogen recognition  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
sub-networks of genes up-regulated in the arabidopsis genome in response to full-length calcuv ac <dig> protein. the diagrams illustrate sub-networks of genes that may be co-regulated in arabidopsis, in response to the transcription activation domain of ac <dig>  sub-networks i , v  and iv  were up-regulated at one dpi. highly linked genes in sub-network iv  were up-regulated at two dpi. the sub-networks were selected from the network analysis presented in .



another sub-network , consists of genes encoding proteins associated with the cell wall and/or cytoskeleton . there has been substantial work on the involvement of cytoskeletal and membrane components on plant virus movement, with many viruses encoding proteins that interact with the cytoskeleton  <cit> . the possibility that viruses can utilize host membranes for movement has increased based on observations that there are numerous diverse viruses that replicate in association with membranes  <cit> . geminiviruses including bean dwarf mosaic virus, encode a movement protein  that alters the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata to promote movement of the viral genome to adjacent cells  <cit> . in contrast, the squash leaf curl virus mp induces the formation of er-derived tubules, which mediate transport of a viral protein–dna complex to adjacent cells  <cit> . while the relationship of genes in these sub-networks to viral pathogenesis is currently unknown, it is interesting to speculate that ac <dig> may induce host genes that are important for cell-to-cell and long-distance movement of the virus. this would support the known role of ac <dig> in activating transcription of the br <dig> nuclear shuttle protein in begomoviruses to facilitate movement of the virus  <cit> .

of the six sub-networks identified within the  <dig> genes that were up-regulated in response to full length ac <dig> protein at two dpi , one may be of particular interest. the highly linked genes within sub-network iv , all appear to have functions related to the cell cycle. one gene encodes the myb domain protein 3r- <dig> , which is a transcription factor that positively regulates cytokinesis  <cit> . however, activation appears to require phosphorylation of the c-terminal domain of the protein, since unphosphorylated myb3r <dig> acts as a repressor of mitosis  <cit> . in fact, a functional myb3r <dig> protein appears to be required for establishment of the endocycle, which is induced in response to powdery mildew infection  <cit> . this may be extremely relevant to geminiviruses, especially as ploidy increases during calcuv infection  <cit> , and maize streak virus repa protein induces endoreduplication  <cit> . alterations in expression of cell cycle-associated and core cell cycle genes in response to calcuv infection suggests specific activation of s phase and inhibition of m phase, as a possible mechanism to induce the endocycle  <cit> . a second gene, cyclin a2; <dig> , also up regulated in response to full-length ac <dig>  plays a role in determining the balance between mitosis and the endocycle. however, it has been suggested that an absence or reduction in cyca <dig> levels controls endoreduplication, and that expression of cyca <dig> is achieved through the protein, increased level of polyploidy <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, ilp <dig> levels were elevated in calcuv infected leaves, although no change in the expression of cyca <dig> genes was detected  <cit> . in contrast, an increase in the expression of cyca2; <dig> was detected in transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing bctv l <dig>  <cit> .

for the  <dig> unique genes that were down regulated in response to full length ac <dig> at one dpi , five of these were highly connected in a network of genes that are co-regulated, and all five appear to be involved in the defense response to pathogen infection . map kinase substrate  <dig>  is a substrate for map kinase  <dig> , which in arabidopsis regulates pathogen defense responses. overexpression of mks <dig> appears to be sufficient to activate sa-dependent resistance, and mks <dig> interacts with wrky transcription factors, including wrky <dig>  which is an in vitro substrate of mpk <dig>  <cit> . as different domains of mks <dig> interact with mpk <dig> and wrky it has been suggested that these proteins play a role in transcription or chromatin remodeling complexes, contributing to mpk4-regulated defense activation  <cit> . the fact that steady state mrna levels for mks <dig> and wrky <dig> are down-regulated by ac <dig>  could be interpreted as a strategy to circumvent sa-dependent responses to virus infection. two other genes connected to mks <dig> and wrky <dig> are e <dig> ubiquitin ligases. pub <dig> is a u-box-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, which acts to negatively regulate pamp-triggered immunity   <cit> . pathogen infection leads to an increase in expression of pub <dig>  but decreased expression results in an impaired ability to down-regulate responses triggered by pamps  <cit> . toxicos en levadura  <dig> , a ring-h <dig> ubiquitin e3-ligase, is rapidly induced in response to elicitors, including chitin, and may function to mediate ubiquitination of negative regulators of defense response  <cit> . thus, down-regulation of this gene by ac <dig> would prevent degradation of proteins involved in turning off defense responses, thus preventing the host from initiating a response to infection. interestingly, wrky <dig>  atl <dig> and embryo sac development arrest  <dig> , a calmodulin binding protein in this regulatory network, are also induced in response to chitooctaose, an elicitor of plant defense responses against pathogens  <cit> . therefore, it appears as though this network of genes could be a high value target for geminiviruses.figure  <dig> 
sub-networks of genes down-regulated in the arabidopsis genome in response to full-length calcuv ac <dig> protein. the diagrams illustrate sub-networks of genes that may be co-regulated in arabidopsis, in response to the transcription activation domain of ac <dig>  genes within sub-network i  and sub-network iv  were down-regulated at one and two dpi respectively. the sub-networks were selected from the network analysis presented in .



at two dpi,  <dig> genes were down-regulated in response to the full length ac <dig> protein, and two sub-networks were detected consisting of highly connected genes . within sub-network ii , two genes are of potential relevance for geminivirus pathogenicity. expression of full length ac <dig> down-regulated cytokinin-hypersensitive  <dig> , which encodes pickle, a protein similar to the chd <dig> class of swi/snf chromatin remodeling factors  <cit> . mutations within this gene result in rapidly growing green calli, which is attributed to hypersensitivity to cytokinins, where cytokinin-responsive genes respond to much lower levels of cytokinin  <cit> . down regulation of ckh <dig> by calcuv ac <dig> could be interpreted as a mechanism to induce cytokinin responses in order to promote cell proliferation and therefore viral replication. some evidence for this conclusion is provided by data demonstrating that begomovirus ac <dig>  and curtovirus c <dig>  proteins increase cytokinin-responsive promoter activity and that application of exogenous cytokinin increases susceptibility to geminivirus infection  <cit> .

a second gene within this sub-network that is down-regulated by ac <dig> is hobbit , which encodes a homolog of the cdc27/nuc2/bima/apc <dig> subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex   <cit> . the hbt protein regulates m-phase progression. hbt transcripts mainly accumulate around the g2/m phase in dividing cells, and mutations in the hbt gene interfere with post-embryonic cell division and differentiation of different cell types  <cit> . this gene may therefore be a valuable target for geminiviruses as down-regulation would presumably interfere with progression of cell differentiation shifting the balance in favor of cell proliferation, possibly in conjunction with down-regulation of ckh <dig> to promote cell proliferation.

validation of microarray results by quantitative real-time pcr
for this analysis we focused on a single network that contained five down-regulated genes associated with plant defense, that were found to be highly connected at one dpi after expression of full-length ac <dig> . even though these five genes were only differentially regulated at one dpi in the microarray analysis, total rna was isolated at both one and two dpi from arabidopsis leaves infused with agrobacterium containing dna capable of expressing full-length ac <dig> or a vector control. after generation of cdna, quantitative real time pcr  analysis was performed using gene-specific primers  to verify differential regulation. as can be seen , at one dpi expression of atpub <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atatl <dig> and ateda <dig> were all significantly down regulated up to two fold in samples from leaves infused with ac <dig> relative to samples from leaves treated with empty vector . however, at two dpi no significant difference in expression was detectable for any of the four genes, although expression was still lower than that in samples from leaves treated with empty vector . these results are consistent with the microarray data, where these genes were significantly down regulated at one dpi but not at two dpi . interestingly, expression of atmks <dig> was not significantly altered at one dpi  in samples from leaves infused with ac <dig> relative to samples from leaves treated with empty vector . the reasons for this are not clear but may be a consequence of differences between the two methods, including but not limited to, the utilization of vastly different normalization procedures, different strategies in probe design and sensitivity limits of pcr vs. hybridization-based approaches  <cit> .figure  <dig>

differential expression of genes responding to inactivation of snrk <dig> by sctv c <dig> or assnrk <dig> 
a second goal of this study was to examine the consequence of the interaction between sctv c <dig> and snrk <dig> . to do this we compared the transcriptomes in arabidopsis leaves expressing full-length sctv c <dig> or an antisense construct of snrk <dig>   at one and two dpi . the rationale for this approach is that interaction between geminvirus ac <dig> and c <dig> proteins results in inactivation of the kinase  <cit> , and assnrk <dig>  is expected to result in degradation of sense mrna through the sirna pathway and lead to loss of snrk <dig>  activity. thus, genes found to be differentially regulated in response to both treatments is presumed to be a consequence of reduced snrk <dig>  activity. of those genes up-regulated in response to c <dig> or assnrk <dig>   <dig> were common to both treatments at one dpi and  <dig> at two dpi . for genes down-regulated in response to c <dig> or assnrk <dig>  at one or two dpi, we observed  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, that were common to both treatments . these genes are therefore interpreted to represent genes responding to inhibition of snrk <dig> activity by geminvirus c <dig> protein. it is important to note here that the total number of genes differentially regulated in response to both c <dig> and assnrk <dig> was ~ five-fold higher at day two .figure  <dig> 
numbers of genes differentially expressed in response to sctv c <dig> and antisense snrk <dig> . venn diagrams illustrating the intersection between up- and down-regulated genes in arabidopsis leaves expressing sctv c <dig> or antisense snrk <dig> , for one and two dpi respectively.



some differentially regulated genes were specific to each individual treatment. of those genes specifically up-regulated by sctv c <dig>  we detected  <dig> at one dpi and  <dig> at two dpi .  <dig> and  <dig> genes were specifically down-regulated by sctv c <dig>  at one and two dpi respectively. presumably, these genes are differentially regulated in response to additional functions of sctv c <dig>  which would include interaction with and inactivation of adk  <cit> , and possibly additional unknown functions. there were also many genes whose expression changed specifically in response to expression of assnrk <dig> . at day one and two dpi, we detected  <dig> and  <dig> genes respectively, up-regulated in response to assnrk <dig> alone . for genes down-regulated in response to assnrk <dig> alone,  <dig> and  <dig> were detected at one and two dpi respectively . as these genes were not differentially regulated in response to sctv c <dig>  we conclude that this may be a consequence specific to snrk <dig>  activity.

functional categorization of genes differentially regulated in response to assnrk <dig> 
the focus of this analysis was to characterize genes found to be differentially regulated in response to both sctv c <dig> and assnrk <dig> . we categorized these genes by biological process using the david bioinformatics resource. most of the go biological process categories were represented among the significant genes, but several categories were significantly enriched as compared to the arabidopsis genome as a whole. in this case, genes associated with transcription, protein metabolism and transport, and electron transport or energy pathways were over-represented .

network analysis of genes differentially regulated in response to inactivation of snrk <dig> 
we overlayed the assnrk <dig>  responsive genes to the arabidopsis co-expression network, and extracted dense subnetworks for further investigation. given the small number of genes that were up-  or down-  regulated in response to both sctv c <dig> and assnrk <dig>  at one dpi, no networks consisting of highly connected genes were identified. however, at two dpi a large increase in the number of genes that were up-  and down-  regulated revealed complex networks . of the  <dig> genes that were up regulated in response to sctv c <dig> and assnrk <dig>  at two dpi, a large complex network was identified , within which several genes have functions associated with autophagy. this is a process by which cytoplasmic contents, including proteins and organelles, are sequestered within the autophagosome, a double-membrane vesicle, which can deliver the contents to lysosomes or vacuoles through fusion for degradation  <cit> . autophagy is involved in both the responses to biotic stresses, including viral infection, and in regulating senescence, and many autophagy genes have been identified and functionally analyzed in plants. of the three genes within this network found to be up-regulated in response to c <dig> and assnrk <dig> , the role of the apg <dig>  complex is unclear. however, apg <dig>  is an e <dig> ubiquitin-activating enzyme that conjugates phosphatidylethanolamine to atg8h   <cit> . more evidence is being provided that autophagy may function either to facilitate or prevent viral pathogenesis  <cit> . as a defense against pathogen infection, autophagy has been shown to play an important role in both pathogen-induced hypersensitive cell death , and the plant antiviral immune response. rapid immune responses, including hr, are induced in tobacco plants carrying the n-resistance gene when infected by tobacco mosaic virus . the result of this is limitation on the replication and systemic spread of the virus  <cit> . silencing of beclin1/atg <dig>  atg <dig>  or apg <dig> resulted in the spread of cell death, suggesting that autophagy plays an anti-death role during pathogen infection to limit the spread of hr beyond initially infected cells  <cit> . a suppressor of programmed cell death in tomato  has been shown to interact with tomato atg8h although it is not clear at this time whether adi <dig> is targeted by autophagy  <cit> . since autophagy is an emerging antiviral process employed by the host immune system, certain viruses have successfully evolved to either avoid, subvert or even actively induce autophagy to ensure a productive infection  <cit> . interestingly, autophagy-related transcripts, including atg8h and atg <dig>  were up regulated during infection of tomato with tomato yellow leaf curl sardinia virus   <cit>  and in arabidopsis infected with calcuv  <cit> .figure  <dig>

of particular relevance to geminiviruses are recent studies that have shown a role for autophagy in rna silencing  <cit> . this is an antiviral response that results in dsrna-mediated degradation of viral rnas. as a counter-defense, viruses encode rna silencing suppressors  that act to suppress the rna silencing machinery  <cit> . a recent study indicates that a tobacco regulator of gene silencing calmodulin-like protein  binds to an arginine-rich region within a number of viral rsss, resulting in degradation through autophagosomes  <cit> . this supports the idea that autophagy can provide a secondary antiviral mechanism by targeting viral rsss for degradation. however, we have recently demonstrated that in the case of geminiviruses, there appears to be a different mechanism where ac <dig>  the begomovirus rss, induces rgscam and may in fact sequester rgscam in the nucleus to prevent targeting of ac <dig> for degradation via the autophagy pathway  <cit> . while we cannot explain this apparent discrepancy, it could reflect a difference between the rna viruses used in one study  <cit>  and geminiviruses in our study  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that the polerovirus p <dig> rss targets argonaute  <dig>  for degradation via the autophagy pathway  <cit> . at this time it is unknown whether ac <dig> specifically targets genes in the autophagy pathway to facilitate pathogenesis.

of further interest to geminivirus pathogenesis is the observation that under conditions of stress, including pathogen infection, ampk appears to regulate the autophagy pathway through two mechanisms. first, ampk directly interacts with ulk <dig>  an autophagy initiator, through phosphorylation  <cit> . ampk can indirectly induce autophagy through phosphorylation of raptor, which inhibits the mtorc <dig> complex  <cit> . thus, phosphorylation of ulk <dig> by mtorc <dig> and/or ampk results in either negative or positive regulation of autophagy respectively  <cit> . the geminvirus ac2/c <dig> proteins have been shown to interact with and inactivate snrk <dig>  the plant homolog of ampk  <cit> . under the stress of viral infection, this would prevent phosphorylation of raptor maintaining an active mtorc <dig> complex. this would ensure that the autophagy pathway is inhibited. secondly, inhibition of snrk <dig> by ac2/c <dig> would prevent direct phosphorylation of ulk <dig>  again preventing activation of the authophagy pathway. however, there is an apparent paradox given that we detect up-regulation of autophagy genes in response to both full length sctv c <dig> and assnrk <dig> . this can be partially explained by observations that the autophagosome marker atg <dig> is rapidly up regulated under starvation conditions in yeast, and that most of the autophagy genes are regulated at a transcriptional level  <cit> . this reiterates the importance of snrk <dig> as a high value target for geminiviruses  <cit> , by preventing activation of autophagy in the event of up-regulation of genes in that pathway.

for the  <dig> common genes that were down regulated at two dpi, a large complex network containing highly connected genes that appear to be co-regulated was identified . two smaller clusters of genes within this network  have functions associated with the ribosome and translation. although the genes identified have not been specifically reported to play roles in viral pathogenesis, there are examples of ribosomal proteins that play a role in antiviral defense, and so it may not be surprising that geminiviruses down-regulate these genes to facilitate infection. with respect to geminiviruses, the nuclear shuttle protein  has been shown to target the nsp-interacting kinases , which are leucine-rich-repeat  receptor-like-kinases  involved in antiviral defense  <cit> . nik <dig> phosphorylates the ribosomal protein, rpl10a, which functions as an immediate downstream effector of the nik1-mediated response and binding of nsp to nik <dig> inhibits its kinase activity preventing the antiviral defense pathway from impacting geminvirus infection  <cit> .

validation of microarray data by quantitative real-time rt-pcr
we chose to analyze six genes with functions associated with autophagy and senescence  that were up-regulated in response to both c <dig> and assnrk <dig> . total rna was isolated at both one and two dpi from arabidopsis leaves infused with agrobacterium containing dna capable of expressing full-length c <dig>  assnrk <dig>  or the vector control . in addition, we also used an inverted repeat construct designed to express dsrna  that is known to reduce target mrna levels in infused n.benthamiana leaves  <cit> . after generation of cdna, qpcr analysis was performed using gene-specific primers  to verify differential regulation. as shown , significant increases in expression were observed in response to sctv c <dig>  assnrk <dig>  and dssnrk <dig>  at two dpi for all six genes tested. no significant changes in expression were detectable at one dpi . this is consistent with the microarray data where expression of these genes increased in response to both sctv c <dig> and assnrk <dig>  . given that we also observed up-regulation of these genes in response to silencing of snrk <dig>  with an inverted repeat construct  we interpret this to be a consequence of the inactivation/inhibition of snrk <dig> .figure  <dig> 
quantitative pcr analysis of genes differentially regulated in response to inactivation of snrk <dig>  values were determined by qpcr analysis of total rna isolated from arabidopsis leaves infused with agrobacterium containing dna capable of expressing full-length spinach curly top virus c <dig>  antisense snrk <dig> , an inverted repeat construct designed to express dsrna  or an empty plasmid vector . the columns represent relative mrna levels in c <dig>  assnrk <dig>  or dssnrk1-infused leaves as compared to levels present in leaves infused with agrobacterium containing empty plasmid vector , which was arbitrarily assigned a value of  <dig> at each time point. the fold change was calculated from the mean ∆∆ct values from three independent experiments using rna isolated two days post-infusion . error bars represent the standard error of the mean and asterisks indicate significant differences in expression as determined using the student’s t-test  on ∆ct values.



CONCLUSIONS
it is becoming increasingly apparent that geminiviruses manipulate the host in several ways to facilitate an environment conducive to infection, predominantly through the use of multifunctional proteins. as one example, tgmv al <dig> protein is necessary for origin recognition and initation of rcr  <cit> . tgmv al <dig> also binds to a plant retinoblastoma  protein  <cit> , and is sufficient for pcna accumulation  <cit> . this is analogous to small dna tumor viruses, where adenovirus and sv <dig> deregulate the cell cycle via interaction with the prb and p <dig> pathways  <cit> . in addition, infection by calcuv has been shown to influence the host transcriptome  <cit> , again demonstrating the ability of geminiviruses to manupulate the host to ensure efficient infection. a second multifunctional protein encoded by geminviruses that influences the host response to infection, is the ac2/c <dig> protein. we have recently shown that the calcuv cp promoter is regulated by ac <dig> through an interaction with ppd <dig>  a plant specific dna binding protein, that specifically binds sequences known to mediate activation of the cp promoter of calcuv and tgmv  <cit> . an indirect promoter targeting mechanism could provide an opportunity for the virus  to alter host gene expression. this may in turn reprogram the host to support virus infection and/or evade host defense responses. additional interactions between ac2/c <dig> and snrk <dig>  and adk lead to suppression of host defenses  <cit> , which could also lead to alterations in host transcriptome. in support of this, our study along with others using either whole virus infections  <cit>  or over-expression of ac <dig> from acmv or mmymv  <cit> , identified large scale changes in the host transcriptome. the other studies were performed either in whole arabidopsis plants  <cit> , transient assays using arabidopsis protoplasts  <cit>  or transgenic nictotiana tabacum constitutively expressing ac <dig>  <cit> . the complexity of possible effects of ac <dig> makes it desirable to extend this type of analysis under different conditions to identify key host factors independent of laboratories and host plant-virus interactions. thus, the current study is complementary to the others and provides completely novel aspects for the functional analysis. as with the other studies, we identified several categories of genes that were significantly enriched as compared to the arabidopsis genome as a whole, including genes for dna/rna metabolism, transcription, response to stress, protein metabolism, signal transduction, cell organization and biogenesis, transport and electron transport or energy. our analysis enabled us to identify networks containing highly connected genes that could reflect co-regulated functional gene modules. two of these highlight the significance of our approach in uncovering novel clusters of genes targeted by geminiviral rsss. as an example, sub-networks containing genes having functions associated with the chloroplast and the cell wall and/or cytoskeleton, could reflect a direct role for ac <dig> in inducing the expression of genes important for virus movement. the latter may have uncovered an explanation for the observation that mutations within the tgmv ac <dig> gene lead to loss of infectivity  <cit> . this is due, primarily, to the fact that ac <dig> is required for the transcriptional activation of the br <dig> nuclear shuttle protein which is necessary for movement of the virus  <cit> . thus, alteration of genes associated with the chloroplast and cell wall and/or cytoskeleton could reflect a direct role for ac <dig> in inducing the expression of genes important for virus movement. it will be interesting to determine whether the promoters of the genes identified have any cis-acting elements in common with the br <dig> genes of begomoviruses.

in a second example, our network-based approach has identified a potential link between rna silencing suppressors, snrk <dig>  and autophagy . this is supported by recent evidence demonstrating that autophagy plays a role in directing degradation of dicer and ago <dig>  important proteins in mirna processing and in post-transcriptional regulation of dicer mrna  <cit> . therefore, it has been proposed that autophagy may represent a checkpoint for maintaining homeostasis of mirna populations  <cit> , and so it interesting to speculate that inhibition of snrk <dig>  by the geminivirus ac2/c <dig> proteins may have wide-reaching effects on both rna silencing and autophagy. however, many unresolved questions remain regarding the role of autophagy in viral pathogenesis, but targeting of this pathway underscores the likely importance of autophagy as a component of antiviral immunity.

our approach to identifying highly connected genes that are differentially regulated by ac <dig> has revealed co-regulated gene networks that are potentially targeted by geminiviruses during infection. many of these genes would not have been thought of as functioning in a network, but this approach allows us to assess them as a functioning unit and determine the importance of the network as a whole in viral pathogenesis. we can now identify novel pathways of co-regulated genes that are stimulated in response to pathogen infection in general, and virus infection in particular. we are currently confirming the differential expression of genes in all the sub-networks and are investigating the role each sub-network plays in viral pathogenesis.
