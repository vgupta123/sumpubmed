BACKGROUND
bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries are indispensable for many applications in genomic studies  <cit> . bac-end sequences have been used to develop sequence-tagged connector  frameworks  <cit> , to survey genome structures  <cit> , and for comparative analysis of gene structure and synteny. although the whole-genome shotgun method has been used to produce genome draft sequences  <cit> , mapped bacs usually have been required to provide a framework for sequence assembly and templates to complete the sequences of complex genomes  <cit> . bacs and bac-based maps have also been used in sequencing of targeted genome regions  <cit> , chromosomal landing or positional cloning  <cit> , genome function investigation  <cit> , and evolutionary and comparative studies  <cit> . through bac sequencing, a full-length avian androgen receptor gene was identified, which had not been detected with conventional methods  <cit> .

sharks belong to the phylogenetic taxon comprising the oldest jawed vertebrates, the cartilaginous fish, which diverged from the common ancestor of all other jawed vertebrates 460– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . genomic and genetic studies of this group, in comparison to representative species in other vertebrate taxa, will allow us to theorize about the fundamental genetic, developmental, and functional characteristics in the common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates. this ancient taxon is of particular interest to us since it is the oldest group of living animals having an adaptive immune system with underlying molecules and mechanisms similar to those of mammals  <cit> . while most sharks and other cartilaginous fish have large genome sizes , the nurse shark genome size is relatively small at  <dig> ×  <dig> bp/haploid genome, only slightly larger than that of humans . thus, the nurse shark is a candidate to become a model species in the biomedical and genomics fields. however, most of the shark genes and intergenic regions are much larger than those of mammals, and thus large-insert genomic libraries are essential to obtain sufficient genomic information. previously, bac libraries of other cartilaginous fish were described by miyake and amemiya  <cit> . in this paper we report the construction and characterization of a publicly-available nurse shark bac library and carry out a preliminary genome survey.

RESULTS
bac library construction
we constructed a nurse shark bac library, consisting of a total of  <dig>  clones that were deposited in  <dig> barcode-ordered 384-well microtiter plates. to complete this large library, approximately  <dig> ligations were performed. since colonies with a diameter of < <dig>  mm did not grow well in the freezing media, only those colonies with a diameter of > <dig>  mm on selection-agar plates were picked.

insert size distribution
to evaluate the quality of the bac library, we first analyzed the insert sizes of  <dig> sampling bac clones with not i , which liberates the inserts from the bac vector . the  <dig> sampling bac clones were selected by picking one clone from a <dig> position of every other 384-well plate of the library and arranged in the same order as the library plates. of the  <dig> bac clones,  <dig> did not yield detectable dna. of the remaining  <dig> clones, only one had no insert, indicating a negligible empty-vector rate . while most clones produced only one not i insert band, ~16% of the clones produced more than one insert band due to the presence of internal not i sites. eight such clones produced a single or very few small insert bands with high dna densities disproportional to the dna density of the vector band, suggesting co-migration of multiple repetitive bands. in fact, when these clones were digested with swa i  that also liberates the inserts, they generated single large-insert bands . these clones may be of interest because they might contain large repetitive and structurally distinctive regions with extremely high gc content. the average insert size of the  <dig> clones is  <dig> kb, and thus the entire bac library covers ~ <dig>  ×  <dig> bp . the nurse shark genome content was reported to be ~ <dig> pg dna per cell  <cit> , ~ <dig> ×  <dig> bp per haploid genome. thus, our bac library covers ~ <dig> haploid genome equivalents. approximately 94% of clones contain inserts greater than  <dig> kb. although multiple ligations were used, no significant difference was observed between different library segments corresponding to the different ligations except that one segment of  <dig>  clones, corresponding to the library plates  <dig> to  <dig> , has very large inserts. this segment resulted from two parallel ligations and has an average insert size of  <dig> kb.

bac end sequence analysis
we sequenced the first  <dig> of the above  <dig> sampling clones at both ends. one hundred seventy-seven bac end sequences  were obtained with an average high-quality base-pair  number of  <dig> bp , covering a total of ~ <dig>  bp. the average gc content of the bes is 41%, ranging from 26–66%. sequences from other parts of the nurse shark genome  have an average of 42–45% gc content , which is consistent with this finding. it is worth noting that the gc content was calculated in windows of the bes lengths, and some smaller regions may contain higher gc content. indeed, we previously detected simple repeats with a high gc content  in a region of the major histocompatibility complex  class i gene  <cit> . analysis of the bes also revealed  <dig> sequences containing significantly long microsatellite repeats :   <dig>    <dig>    <dig> and   <dig>  however, no significant tri-nucleotide or longer motifs of ssrs were found in our bes. the cpg dinucleotide frequency was under-represented  while the aa and tt dinucleotide frequencies were over-represented in this set of bes.

blastn and blastx searches of these bes against the 'nr' database in genbank and tblastx and tblastn searches against an in-house collection of conserved domains of non-ltr retroelements were carried out with an e-value of below 1e- <dig>  the blast analysis results are classified in table  <dig> . nine bes share a significant similarity with various shark genomic sequences; one  is similar to 18s ribosomal rna; two showed hits to zebrafish and tetraodon genomic sequences that remain 'unclassified'; and one hundred and two showed 'no hits'. twenty-nine and five bes contained lines and sines respectively, indicating that these repetitive elements are major components of the nurse shark genome. most of them hit regions of published nurse shark genomic sequences, especially to an intron of the lmp7-like pseudogene, and non-coding sequences from genes in other shark species , and the 3'-untranslated region  of a non-classical class i gene, uaa-nc <dig>  <cit>  that contains a retrotransposon. most of the lines contain partial open reading frames  encoding reverse transcriptases related to the cr <dig> family, first found in chicken  <cit> . the high representation of cr1-like sines/lines is thus likely to be a common feature of shark genomes. in the sandbar shark , a total of  <dig> cr1-like sine/line elements were found in the  <dig>  kb intergenic region of rag <dig> and rag <dig>  <cit> .

nsre <dig> and nsre <dig> analysis 

the remaining  <dig> bes and one other  that also contains a line element are of interest. they hit only nurse shark bac draft sequences when searched against 'htgs'  database in genbank. when blastn searches were performed using the whole bes set as the database and the bes as queries, they were categorized into two groups designated as nsre <dig>  and nsre <dig> . searching against the 'nr' database in genbank revealed that  <dig> of  <dig> nsre <dig> sequences hit the nurse shark uaa-nc <dig> cdna  in the 5'utr , and  <dig> of  <dig> nsre <dig> sequences hit the nurse shark lmp <dig> pseudogene, exon  <dig>  at nt positions 3274– <dig> . the  <dig> bp-sequence of gc_ba0153a <dig> f  hit the subject regions in two query regions , showing two nsre <dig> in one bes. two bac clones  hit the subject regions at both ends. when the subject sequence  nt positions 2– <dig> region was used as a query to search the 'htgs' database in genbank, it only hit all the  <dig> nurse shark bac draft sequences then present in the genbank in multiple regions with an average of  <dig>  hits/bac, from a minimum of  <dig> to a maximum of  <dig> . searching the nsre <dig> sequence  against the 'htgs' database in genbank found an average of  <dig>  hits/bac on  <dig> of the  <dig> nurse shark bac draft sequences ranging from a minimum of  <dig> to a maximum of  <dig>  these results indicate that nsre <dig> and nsre <dig> are repetitive elements, and nsre <dig> is more frequent in the nurse shark genome than nsre <dig>  blastx searches of both nsre <dig> and nsre <dig> did not detect any protein matches. to further sample the representation and organization of nsre <dig> and nsre <dig> elements in the nurse shark genome including coding and non-coding regions, we sequenced the bac clone gc_ba0754i <dig>  the draft sequence of this clone revealed seventeen nsre <dig> and six nsre <dig> in a ~ <dig> kb region dispersed among sines/lines repetitive elements. all identified repetitive elements are found most abundantly in regions outside of the gene .

to confirm that these repetitive sequences were present in a high copy number in the nurse shark genome and to test for their existence in related animals, we did southern blotting and library screening using 'overgo' probes of nsre <dig> and nsre <dig>  both the nsre <dig> and nsre <dig> probes hybridized to the nurse shark genomic dna, but not to dna from other elasmobranchs , xenopus laevis, rat, human and zebra finch . both the nsre <dig> and nsre <dig> hybridization signals are smear, indicating that these elements are highly repetitive and dispersed in the nurse shark genome, consistent with our sequence analysis results above. from a library screening of  <dig>  clones, many colonies hybridized with different intensities , perhaps correlating with the copy numbers within the bac clones. our data suggest that the expansion of nsre <dig> and nsre <dig> repetitive elements occurred after the divergence of nurse shark from other shark lineages. however, we examined only distantly related shark species in this study. closely related shark species, belonging to the same family  as nurse shark , must be examined for the presence/absence of these repetitive elements. it is possible that different, unique repetitive elements will be found in other shark species.

bac library screening with gene-specific probes
to further assess the quality and demonstrate the utility of the bac library, we screened the entire bac library with gene-specific probes. these probes are listed in table  <dig>  with all single-copy gene probes except tap <dig>  and ring <dig>  we obtained 6– <dig> positive clones . a similar number of positive clones was observed when we used the factor b probe, present in two tandem copies in the nurse shark genome. we further confirmed the positive clones by colony hybridization . most of the gene probes except cd <dig>  <cit>  resulted in 8– <dig> true positives, consistent with the 11x coverage calculated from the average insert size and total number of clones. the low percentage  of true positives from mhc class i and cd <dig> may be due to weakly hybridizing false-positives, which appeared only after long film exposures. in some cases, we observed multiple weaker signals in the vicinity of the stronger signals in the same double-spotting pattern, presumably due to carryover during filter production. in fact, the low percentage  of true positives for the tap <dig> probe was most probably due to such carryover of positive clones into neighboring wells. once we carefully selected putative positive clones for tcr probes , the percentage of true positives increased . tap <dig> and ring <dig> are members of large gene families containing conserved domains, which might cross-hybridize to other family members and thus result in higher number of positive clones than expected. with the lmp <dig> probe,  <dig> positive clones seem to be low for a multi-copy gene, however we have found at least  <dig> pseudogenes containing only small fragments of the gene  <cit> . these results showed that most genetic regions tested in this study  were well represented in the bac library.

unlike most other species, the nurse shark mhc genes are much  larger than those of mammals and have even larger distances in intergenic regions  <cit> . previously, we constructed a genomic cosmid library with an average insert size of ~ <dig> kb. however, most cosmid clones contain at most a single gene . in this study, we used several linked genes ) to quickly glean the number of genes in a single bac clone; we found up to four genes in a single bac clone, making physical mapping possible. thus far, our analysis has convincingly shown that the bac library is a useful tool  to obtain genetic information for this species.

CONCLUSIONS
we report in this paper a large insert, deep-coverage and high-quality bac library for a cartilaginous fish that will be very useful to the scientific community for gene isolation, genetic analysis, and comparative genomics. we found two new groups of repetitive elements, designated as nsre <dig> and nsre <dig>  which are specific to the nurse shark genome. these repetitive elements may contribute to the architecture and evolution of the nurse shark genome. the bac library, hdr filters and individual clones are available to the public from the arizona genomics institute's bac/est resource center  <cit> .
