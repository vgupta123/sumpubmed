BACKGROUND
streptococcus pyogenes or group a streptococcus  causes a number of clinical manifestations and diseases including sore throat, pyoderma, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic-shock syndrome, and the post-infectious sequelae – rheumatic fever  and rheumatic heart disease   <cit> . rf and rhd are a major health concern worldwide but especially in indigenous communities within developed countries, and in populations of developing countries  <cit> . the gas surface m protein is known to prevent opsonophagocytosis and is a major virulence factor in gas infection  <cit> . the n-terminal region of the m protein is highly variable between different gas strains and contains a type-specific moiety, the antigenic variation of which forms the basis for the classical m protein serological typing of gas. however, there are disadvantages with this method of typing including ambiguities in the results, the emergence of new m types, and the high rates of m protein-nontypeable  strains  <cit>  largely due to the unavailability of specific typing antisera. as a consequence, there has been a surge of interest in the development of alternative methods for m typing utilizing molecular technologies.

several methods have been developed for gas typing such as enzyme electrophoretic polymorphism  <cit> , genomic typing methods such as rapd  <cit> , 16s rdna typing  <cit> , rflp analysis  <cit> , vir typing  <cit> , dna hybridization using n-terminal sequences of the m protein gene  as oligonucleotide probes  <cit> , polymerase chain reaction -enzyme linked immunosorbant assay  <cit> , and pcr m typing using type-specific oligonucleotide primers for pcr amplification of the n-terminal region of the emm gene  <cit> . pcr-rflp analysis which utilizes pcr to amplify the emm gene amplicons encoding the m protein prior to digestion with restriction endonucleases has been used for specific molecular m typing methods  <cit> , as well as multilocus sequence typing   <cit> . n-terminal sequencing of the m protein gene, however, is the most conclusive method for typing of gas  <cit> , this method of typing is not an option in most laboratories in developing countries worldwide, due to limited resources, and therefore an alternative approach is required for the identification of gas types. the purpose of this study was therefore to analyze the n-terminal regions of the emm gene of thai gas isolates using pcr-rflp analysis. pcr products were digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme and the fragments analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .

RESULTS
the n- and c-terminal region of the emm gene was amplified by pcr from all of the  <dig> gas isolates. the amplicons consisted of one to four bands which varied from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> bp depending on the m types and gas strains . however, some m types had similar sizes of their emm amplicons, but gave distinct bands after digestion with the restriction enzyme, alu i. this revealed rflp patterns consisting of two to nine distinct fragments, which ranged from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> bp depending on the variability of dna sequences in the emm amplicons of different m types . the rflp patterns of  <dig> unknown gas m types corresponded to  <dig> known m types . the m types of all isolates represented by the pcr-rflp patterns were confirmed by dna sequencing analysis. all isolates were sequenced independently of the pcr-rflp analysis which was carried out blinded. the two sets of data were then compared. only  <dig> isolates gave patterns that did not corresponded to the  <dig> known m types. the isolates that could not be identified by pcr-rflp analysis were also analyzed by dna sequencing. six m types that differed from the  <dig> known m types were obtained from the dna sequencing analysis . although these m protein dna sequences were ≥95% similar to the data in genbank, we found both point mutations and deletions in these isolates. m <dig> has a single-base substitution  that resulted in a new alu i restriction site whereas m <dig> and m <dig> have 21-base and 33-base deletions, respectively. alignment of the amino acid sequences of m <dig> and m <dig> with reference strains in genbank, demonstrated ≥95% similarity .

for decades serotyping has been the method of choice for gas m typing. however, serotyping is time consuming and it is often difficult to produce high-titer m type-specific antisera, and therefore this technique is limited to a few laboratories in the world. to overcome these limitations, genomic typing methods have been developed  <cit> , as well as specific m typing methods  <cit> . rflp analysis of the emm gene revealed different rflp patterns among gas isolates with the same m type  <cit> . therefore, it could potentially be used to differentiate among isolates with the same m type, but which are not clonal, and may originate from different geographical locations or populations.

in this study, we applied pcr-rflp analysis for gas m typing. pcr products derived from the amplification of the n- and c-terminal region of the emm gene and digested with the restriction enzyme, alu i, produced different rflp patterns among different m types. ninety five clinical isolates could be compared with known m types by their rflp patterns. only  <dig> isolates had novel rflp patterns and required sequencing to confirm the m types. our results showed that m <dig> gas was the most common gas strain isolated from the population studied with  <dig> isolates  having this type, and is consistent with a previous study of thai gas isolates  <cit> . other m types that represented more than 10% of the thai gas isolates were m <dig> and m44/ <dig>  whereas m <dig>  emm <dig> , m <dig> and m <dig> were quite rare . furthermore, the specificity of the pcr-rflp analysis was confirmed by sequencing of the n-terminal region of the emm gene. the majority of isolates were sequenced for each m type. m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  emm <dig> , m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and st <dig> were sequenced in all isolates. m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> were sequenced in  <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> isolates, respectively. all isolates were sequenced independently of the pcr-rflp analysis which was carried out blinded. the two sets of data were then compared. the results obtained from the pcr-rflp analysis were in agreement with the sequencing data.

in comparison with other genotyping methods based on rflp analysis  <cit> , the pcr-rflp analysis used here has some technical advantages. only one pair of pcr primers is required for the amplification of all of the gas isolates, and the digested pcr products can be discriminated using standard page which is easy to perform, interpret and is less time consuming. in addition, compared with sequencing analysis  <cit> , the pcr-rflp analysis is technically less demanding and more economical. therefore, with this simple and rapid protocol, gas typing can be used in any laboratory in which pcr is routinely used, and is particularly useful for typing large numbers of gas isolates. however, our findings are based on a relatively small number of emm types isolated in a relatively limited geographic region over a relatively short period of time. greater geographic and temporal diversity may result in greater clonal diversity thus complicating interpretation of rflp patterns. therefore, we suggest that each laboratory should make their own reference rflp patterns from m types that circulate in their region. however, there are several problems that may occur such as point mutation and deletion. these result in the strains that can not be identified. in this case, it should then be typed by sequence analysis and added these variants into their reference rflp patterns. in addition, to confirm validation of their results, sequencing a subset of their analyzed isolated should be done periodically.

CONCLUSIONS
pcr-rflp analysis is a rapid, economical and practical genotyping method for determining the m type of gas. it is therefore particularly suited as a method of choice in developing countries in which gas is endemic and the majority of gas isolates are m protein-nontypeable by conventional serological typing.
