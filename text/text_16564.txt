BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei is a highly pathogenic gram-negative organism and the causative agent of melioidosis, a potentially fatal infectious disease of humans and animals. the bacterium is endemic to tropical regions including south east asia and northern australia; mortality rates resulting from melioidosis remain extremely high, with up to 42 % mortality in the northeastern region of thailand and 14 % mortality in australia’s northern territory  <cit> . importantly, a 90 % mortality rate is associated with septic shock  <cit> . in northern australia, melioidosis accounts for 32 % of community-acquired bacteraemic pneumonia and 6 % of all bacteraemias  <cit> , while in the northeastern region of thailand, the disease accounts for 20 % of all community-acquired septicaemias  <cit>  and is the third most common cause of death from an infectious disease  <cit> . the complex clinical spectrum of melioidosis, the potentially rapid progression of disease and the fact that b. pseudomallei is innately resistant to a wide range of antimicrobial agents  makes treatment of this disease difficult.

for b. pseudomallei and most other opportunistic pathogens, the ability to sense external signals is critical for the transition from their environmental niche into the eukaryotic host, as well as for survival within specific niches within the host. prokaryotic two-component signal transduction systems  constitute a critical set of regulators which act to sense environmental signals and respond by altering gene expression . tcsts generally consist of a membrane-bound sensor kinase  and a cytosolic dna-binding response regulator   <cit> . the sk protein senses extracellular stimuli and responds through the autophosphorylation of a specific histidine residue. this phosphoryl group is then transferred to an aspartate residue on the cytoplasmic rr leading to a conformational change that activates the rr, resulting in the altered expression of a specific set of genes  <cit> . tcsts components are promising drug targets as these systems are not present in mammalian cells and inhibitors that target tcstss are likely to function in a manner distinct from existing antimicrobial agents, thereby providing an alternative treatment for multidrug resistant bacteria  <cit> . moreover, many tcsts regulate expression of virulence genes and therefore drugs that target tcsts could reduce virulence without affecting bacterial viability and thus reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance during treatment regimens  <cit> .

the genome of b. pseudomallei strain k <dig> encodes more than  <dig> tcsts  <cit>  but only a few have been characterized including bpsl2024- <dig>  virag, mrgrs and irlrs. the irlrs system is involved in the regulation of b. pseudomallei invasion of epithelial cells as well as heavy metal resistance. however, an irlr mutant was not attenuated for virulence in the c57bl/ <dig> mouse, infant diabetic rat and syrian hamster models  <cit> . the mrgrs system responds to temperature, with increased expression of mrgr and mrgs observed during growth at 37 °c compared to 25 °c. this system may be involved in pathogenesis, but its role in virulence has not been specifically tested  <cit> . the virag system regulates the expression of the type vi secretion system cluster  <dig>  during growth within macrophages. both a virg mutant and a t6ss- <dig> mutant were attenuated for virulence  <cit> . the gene bpsl <dig>  encoding the sk of a tcsts, was first identified in an in vivo hamster infection microarray study and a directed bpsl <dig> mutant was significantly attenuated in the hamster model   <cit> .

here we characterise a tcsts in b. pseudomallei that we have named bprrs. inactivation of the entire bprrs system via inactivation of both genes had no effect on virulence or motility and rna expression analysis of the double bprrs mutant revealed few changes in gene expression. however, inactivation of only one component  led to an attenuated phenotype in both virulence and motility. high-throughput rna sequencing  comparing the transcriptomes of the bprs and bprr mutants with the parent strain of b. pseudomallei revealed a large number of expression changes in genes required for chemotaxis, flagella biosynthesis and production of malleilactone. furthermore, many transcriptional regulators were also differentially expressed in the single gene mutant strains. we propose that the altered phenotypes displayed by the bprr and bprs single mutants are due to the orphaned sensor or the orphaned response regulator  engaging in cross-talk interactions with one or more of the other b. pseudomallei tcsts.

RESULTS
identification of an attenuated b. pseudomallei bprs  signature-tagged transposon mutant
a signature-tagged library of  <dig> b. pseudomallei k <dig> mutants was constructed and screened for reduced in vivo growth in the acute  mouse melioidosis model. mutants displaying reduced hybridisation in the output pools were tested individually for an in vivo growth defect by competitive growth assays. five mutants were identified that displayed a statistically significant in vivo growth defect . four of the attenuated mutants contained transposon insertions within genes required for the biosynthesis of  <dig> -linked 2-o-acetyl-6-deoxy-β-d-manno-heptopyranose capsular polysaccharide . this locus has previously been shown to be important for b. pseudomallei virulence  <cit> . the fifth attenuated mutant contained a tn <dig> insertion within bpss <dig>  and this mutant was designated bprs::tn <dig> . the presence of a single transposon insertion in this mutant was confirmed by southern blot analysis . the id <dig> of the b. pseudomallei parent strain k <dig> and the bprs::tn <dig> mutant was determined in groups of five balb/c mice following inoculation via the intranasal  or intraperitoneal  routes of infection. for the i.n. route of infection, the id <dig> of the bprs::tn <dig> mutant was > <dig>  × 107 cfu while the parent strain k <dig> was < <dig>  × 104 cfu. for the i.p. route of infection, the id <dig> of the bprs::tn <dig> mutant was > <dig>  × 104 cfu compared with < <dig>  × 103 cfu for the parent strain k <dig>  therefore, the bprs::tn <dig> mutant was attenuated for virulence via both infection routes in balb/c mice. importantly, the bprs::tn <dig> mutant displayed normal in vitro growth in both rich medium  and minimal medium  indicating that the attenuated phenotype was not due to a general growth defect .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the bprr  and bprs  genes in the b. pseudomallei k96243 wild-type strain and each of the bprs and bprr mutants. panel a, organisation of the bprrs genes in b. pseudomallei wild-type showing the conserved amino acid domains encoded within each gene. domains shown are the receiver and effector domains within bprr and, within bprs, the following domains: transmembrane regions  <dig> and  <dig>  between which the stimulus-specific region is located, the hamp  signal transduction domain, the hiska  dimerization/phosphoacceptor domain and the hatpase_c  domain. the relative position of the insertion in each of the single mutants is shown below the gene schematic. panel b, schematic representation of the regions remaining in each gene and the relative position of the tetracycline gene cassette in the bprrs double mutant



bioinformatic analysis of bpss <dig> revealed that the predicted protein sequence displayed significant amino acid identity to a number of characterised histidine kinases, including qsec from pseudomonas spp. . several conserved amino acid domains were identified within the predicted sk, including a catalytic histidine kinase-like atpase, c-terminal domain , a histidine kinase a domain , a hamp  signal transduction domain and two transmembrane regions flanking the predicted stimulus-specific region . located immediately upstream of the histidine kinase gene was a gene encoding a protein with receiver and effector domains typical of a rr . rt-pcr using primers that spanned the two genes indicated that bpss <dig> and bpss <dig> were co-transcribed . together these data indicate that bpss <dig> and bpss <dig> encode a cognate tcsts pair named bprrs.

generation of directed bprs, bprr and bprrs mutants and associated virulence studies
to confirm that inactivation of bprs led to an attenuated phenotype, a directed bprs mutant was constructed using double-crossover insertional mutagenesis . we first compared the growth of the parent strain k <dig> and the mutant in balb/c mice using competitive growth assays. the bprs mutant displayed normal in vitro growth  but the in vivo competitive index of the bprs mutant was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , indicative of an approximately 10-fold reduced growth rate in vivo compared to the parent strain. the attenuated phenotype was then confirmed using virulence trials in balb/c mice . mice infected with the parent strain k <dig> displayed signs of illness by 28–50 h  and eight of the nine mice were euthanized by 190 h  after infection. in contrast, the survival rate in the group infected with the bprs mutant was significantly increased , with only two mice developing late stage signs of infection and required euthanasia after 190 h.fig.  <dig> kaplan-meier survival curves for groups of mice infected intranasally with the b. pseudomallei wild-type or the bprs, bprr or bprrs mutant strains. mice were infected with the following doses; wild-type strain, 6 × 104 cfu; bprs mutant, 8 × 104 cfu, bprr mutant, 3 × 104 cfu, bprrs mutant 9 × 104 cfu



to further characterise the bprrs tcsts, a directed bprr mutant  and a bprrs double mutant  were also constructed by double-crossover insertional mutagenesis. the bprr mutant was also highly attenuated for virulence  with only a single mouse showing late-stage disease signs at 150 h  . in contrast, the bprrs mutant was not attenuated for virulence as determined by numbers of surviving mice  or time to euthanasia  . these data clearly show that separate inactivation of bprrs tcsts sk or the rr resulted in decreased virulence, but inactivation of both genes in the bprrs tcsts system did not.

transcriptomic analyses of the bprrs double mutant
tcsts are critical regulators of bacterial gene expression. to understand why the bprrs mutant was not attenuated for virulence, while the single bprr and bprs mutants were, we analysed the transcriptomes of all three mutant strains and the wild-type strain. firstly, to identify the genes controlled by the bprrs system we compared the transcriptomes of the bprrs double mutant and the parent strain, k <dig>  in total, only nine genes were differentially expressed  in the bprrs double mutant . both the truncated bprr and bprs gene fragments showed increased expression, suggesting that the bprrs tcsts likely regulates its own expression. two genes, bpss <dig> and bpss0686a, located immediately upstream of the bprrs tcsts genes but transcribed from the other strand, showed increased expression in the bprrs double mutant ; these genes were also identified as differentially expressed in the bprs single mutant . bioinformatic analyses of bpss0686a revealed no additional information on the open reading frame and analysis of the rna-seq data revealed that only a single sequence read of the  <dig> million sequence reads generated from the parent strain  matched this region, indicating that bpss0686a may not encode a functional protein, or it is not expressed under the conditions used for bacterial growth. bioinformatic analysis of bpss <dig> revealed that it encoded a putative enzyme belonging to the flavin-utilizing monoxygenase super family and the nitrilotriacetate monoxgenase sub-family. moreover, the encoded protein had 65 % identity  to the  <dig>  10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin reductase in methylobacterium extorquens that is required for one carbon metabolism  <cit> . five phage-associated genes were also differentially expressed in the bprrs double mutant; four of these showed decreased expression and one, encoding a phage membrane protein , showed increased expression. three of the phage genes, bpss <dig> and bpss <dig> , and bpss <dig> , are located on chromosome  <dig> within a predicted prophage. the remaining two genes differentially expressed in the bprrs double mutant encoded a predicted atpase  and a phage membrane protein  that were within a large region on chromosome  <dig> also containing a predicted prophage.table  <dig> genes with differential expression in the bprrs double mutant compared to expression in the wild-type parent strain

genes were identified as differentially expressed if they showed >2-fold expression change  compared to the wild-type strain with a false discovery rate  of < <dig>

transcriptomic analyses of the bprs, bprr single gene mutants
in order to identify gene expression changes that resulted from perturbation of the bprrs system via inactivation of bprs, encoding the sk, or bprr, encoding the rr, we compared the transcriptomes of the bprs and bprr mutants with the wild-type strain. a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in one or both of the single mutants and  <dig> genes showed increased expression and  <dig> reduced expression  in both the bprs mutant and the bprr mutants ; thus, these gene lists show a high degree of similarity . moreover, when a slightly less stringent fdr of < <dig>  was applied to the initial gene list generated,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes identified were differentially expressed in both the bprs mutant and the bprr mutant  . genes identified with increased expression in the bprs and bprr single mutants included many involved in the production of secondary metabolites; bpsl3323- <dig> and bpss0689- <dig> involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, bpss0692- <dig> involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds, and all the genes within the malleilactone biosynthesis locus .fig.  <dig> a venn diagram showing the number of b. pseudomallei genes with increased expression  or with reduced expression  in each of the bprr, bprs and bprrs double mutants. genes were identified as differentially expressed if they showed >2-fold expression change  compared to the wild-type strain with a false discovery rate  of < <dig> . the total number of genes in each mutant showing increased expression  with a more relaxed fdr of < <dig>  are shown in brackets

importantly, a large number of regulatory genes were identified as differentially expressed when the bprrs system was perturbed by single gene inactivation. regulatory genes with increased expression in both the bprs and bprr single mutants included flia and bper  and malr , encoding a regulator that shares identity  with malr in burkholderia thailandensis, an orphan luxr homolog that activates the malleilactone biosynthesis genes independently of acyl-homoserine lactone and quorum sensing systems  <cit> . the genes bprp , encoding a transmembrane regulator, and the adjacent gene bprq, encoding a transmembrane protein, involved in the control of the bsan virulence regulon were also over-expressed. importantly, the bsan virulence regulon includes genes encoding the type iii secretion system locus  <dig>   <cit> . the expression of bpss <dig> in both the bprr and bprs single mutants was also increased ; the encoded protein contains an eal domain and shares significant identity with cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterases, which are known to control motility and biofilm formation in a number of bacteria  <cit> . other regulatory genes with increased expression but in only the bprr mutant were bpss <dig> encoding an iclr family protein, bpss <dig> encoding a lysr family protein, and bpsl <dig> that encodes a putative transcriptional regulatory protein . only one regulatory gene  had decreased expression in the bprr mutant. regulatory genes that were reduced in expression but only in the bprs single mutant included bpsl <dig>  encoding an iclr family protein, and dctd, encoding a c4-dicarboxylate transport transcriptional response regulator .

perturbation of the bprrs tcsts affects b. pseudomallei motility
in the mutants with a single inactivation in either bprs or bprr,  <dig> genes involved in flagella biosynthesis were increased in expression, located in four different locations on chromosome  <dig> . in addition, two genes encoding methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins  showed increased expression, and there was decreased expression of the type- <dig> fimbrial gene, bpsl <dig>  predicted to be involved in attachment to surfaces. accordingly, we analysed the bprs mutants , the bprr directed mutant, the parent strain k <dig>  as well as the bprrs double mutant, for their ability to migrate or swarm in a coordinated manner on solid medium. the parent strain k <dig> and the bprrs double mutant both demonstrated a capacity for rapid swarming, with the leading edge of the swarming population migrating to the edge of the agar plate  after 18 h at 37 °c . however, all strains with either bprs or bprr inactivated demonstrated a significantly reduced ability to swarm in a coordinated manner . to confirm that the reduced swarming motility was due to perturbation of the bprrs system, we complemented the bprs directed mutant with the complete bprrs operon in trans. interestingly, we were unable to clone either bprs or bprr into the multicopy plasmid pbhr <dig> alone. swarming motility was fully restored in the bprs complemented strain, whereas the bprs mutant harbouring empty vector  alone retained the reduced motility phenotype . these data show that inactivation of a single component in the bprrs tcsts can reduce the swarming ability of b. pseudomallei.fig.  <dig> the b. pseudomallei bprs and bprr mutants display reduced motility. swarming motility was measured on agar plates grown at 37 °c for 18 h. panel a, selected images of motility plates and panel b, quantification of the motility data. strains are b. pseudomallei wild-type , directed bprs mutant , bprs transposon mutant , bprr mutant , bprrs double mutant , complemented bprs mutant ), bprs mutant containing empty vector ) and a non-motile flic mutant control . data are mean ± sem. * = p <  <dig> 



discussion
we have identified a putative tcsts in b. pseudomallei strain k <dig> that is encoded by bprs  encoding the sk, and bprr  encoding the rr. inactivation of the entire bprrs system did not result in changes to virulence or motility, and rna expression analysis of the bprrs double mutant identified very few genes that were differentially expressed compared to the expression in the parent strain k <dig>  genes identified as differentially expressed in the bprrs double mutant included one  adjacent to the bprs gene, encoding a predicted  <dig>  10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin reductase that is required for one carbon metabolism  <cit> . five genes that encoded phage-related proteins were also identified. thus, our analysis suggests that the bprrs tcsts regulon is small but it is possible that under different growth conditions, such as during growth in a host or the environment, other genes may be identified that belong to the bprrs regulon.

in contrast, inactivation of a single component  of the bprrs tcsts resulted in the differential expression of a large number of genes. more than  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in both the bprs and bprr mutant and included those involved in flagella biosynthesis, malleilactone biosynthesis, antibiotic resistance, chemotaxis and regulation. in addition, phenotypic assays showed that the bprs and bprr mutants displayed reduced growth in mice and reduced swarming motility. together, these results clearly demonstrate that perturbation of the bprrs system, but not inactivation of the whole system, attenuates b. pseudomallei. we hypothesize that the changes observed as a result of perturbation of the bprrs tcsts arise through cross-regulation with one or more of the  <dig> tcsts encoded on the b. pseudomallei genome  <cit> . a number of interactions between tcsts have been identified in escherichia coli; in vitro phosphorylation assays showed that phosphorylation of rrs by non-cognate sks was observed for at least  <dig> pairs  <cit> . while most e. coli cross-talk interactions are weak  <cit> , strong cross-talk has been observed between a number of systems, including crec and phob and the pmra/b and qseb/c systems of e. coli  <cit>  interactions between phob, pmra/b and qseb/c happen at multiple levels including phosphorylation, dephosphorylation and dna binding. the e. coli qsec sk normally acts to dephosphorylate  its cognate rr qseb, but qseb can be phosphorylated by pmrb at relatively high levels  <cit>  and the binding of both rrs at the qsebc promoter is likely to be required for normal gene expression. in the absence of qsec the phosphorylating activity of pmrb on qseb is uncontrolled, leading to increased expression of the qsebc tcsts and decreased expression of a range of virulence genes including those involved in pilin and flagellin synthesis. importantly, while an e. coli qsec mutant was non-motile and attenuated for virulence, the single qseb and the double qsebc mutants showed wild-type virulence and motility  <cit> . cross-regulation has been implicated in at least three e. coli tcsts that affect flagella synthesis and motility, including predicted interactions between arcab and another unidentified tcsts  <cit> . therefore, we propose that in the absence of both bprr and bprs  only the expression of genes within the bprrs regulon is affected. however, in the absence of bprs, bprr is phosphorylated by one or more, non-cognate sensor kinases and interacts with genes outside the bprrs regulon. conversely, we predict that in the absence of bprr, bprs phosphorylates one or more, non-cognate response regulators. moreover, given that a large subset of genes was differentially expressed in both the bprr and bprs mutants, we propose that the majority of cross-talk occurs largely with a single, as yet unidentified, tcsts cognate pair. this cross-talk then leads to a cascade of dysregulation, including altered expression of genes encoding other regulators.

phenotypic analysis of the mutants revealed that the bprs and bprr mutants were attenuated for swarming motility. in both mutants many flagella biosynthesis genes showed increased expression compared to the wild-type strain; suggesting that altered motility resulted from incorrect levels of flagella proteins or dysregulated timing of expression. furthermore, genes within the flagella-associated locus, including flic encoding the flagella subunit, were not changed in expression compared to that in the parent strain k <dig> supporting the proposition that the altered motility of the bprs and bprr mutants may have been affected by an imbalance in the expression of the flagella biosynthesis and structural components. in e. coli and other bacteria, flagella synthesis involves the action of numerous and complex tcsts interactions, and we predict similar interactions between regulatory factors is also likely to be essential for the co-ordinated movement of b. pseudomallei. the gene bpss <dig>  encoding a protein with an eal domain characteristic of cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterases, was increased in expression in both the bprs and bprr mutants. cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterases negatively control levels of bis--cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate  and, together with the positive regulator diguanylate cyclase, initiate the c-di-gmp signalling system in bacteria. the global second messenger c-di-gmp then binds to specific effector molecules that target, and subsequently affect the expression of a wide range of genes involved in cellular functions including motility, biofilm formation and the production of fimbriae  <cit> . a previous study identified another b. pseudomallei gene  as encoding the cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterase involved in flagella function and motility  <cit> . however, our own bioinformatic analysis  indicates that bpsl <dig> encodes a protein with both an eal and a ggdef domain, the latter domain being characteristic of diguanylate cyclases. other regulatory genes with increased expression in the bprs and bprr mutants included two genes encoding predicted mcps, bpsl <dig> and tar. mcps are the trans-membrane sensor proteins of the chemotaxis pathway that controls bacterial movement in response to available nutrients or other environmental stimuli  <cit> . in e. coli, mcps directly transfer phosphate to the tcsts sk chea that then transfers the phosphate to one of two rrs, chey or cheb. phosphorylated chey interacts directly with the flagella motor and causes a directional change, whereas phosphorylated cheb acts a methylesterase on the signalling mcp and modulates the amount of signal  <cit> . the mcp tar sensors induce bacterial cells to move towards aspartate/maltose and away from nickel/cobalt  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis did not provide any information on the type of sensor the bpsl <dig> gene encodes, but we predict that dysregulation of the expression of either mcp is likely to have an effect on motility. although no studies have been conducted on chemotaxis mutants in any burkholderia species, a study in a close relative, ralstonia solanacearum, showed that a chea mutant displayed significantly reduced virulence  <cit> .

the genes bprp and bprq, involved in the bsan virulence regulon, both displayed increased expression when the bprrs tcsts was perturbed. a recent transcriptomic study of a b. pseudomallei bsan deletion mutant elucidated components of the bsan virulence-associated regulatory system  <cit> . it is proposed that bprp directly activates the ara-c like regulatory protein bsan that, together with the t3ss <dig> chaperone bica, act as a dual-function regulatory complex that controls the expression of the t6ss- <dig>  and the t3ss <dig> effectors . in addition, in the bsan mutant the ttss <dig> genes showed increased expression, while the genes involved in malleilactone  and flagella biosynthesis  showed decreased expression  <cit> . in our study, we observed an increase in expression of bprp and bprq, but not the gene encoding the chaperone bica. we also observed an increase in expression of malleilactone-associated and flagella-associated genes, but no significant change in expression of genes associated with the t3ss <dig> and t6ss- <dig>  nevertheless, it is possible that an imbalance in the expression of the proteins that initiate the transcription of bsan  may have an effect on the expression of some genes within the bsan regulon.

perturbation of the bprrs tcsts reduced the in vivo fitness of b. pseudomallei and this may, or may not have been directly associated with the loss of motility. an initial report demonstrated that a non-flagellated flic mutant constructed in b. pseudomallei strain 1026b was not attenuated for virulence in balb/c mice, diabetic rats or syrian hamsters  <cit> . in contrast, a flic mutant of a more virulent strain of b. pseudomallei  was attenuated for virulence in balb/c mice  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses of a newly identified tcsts bprrs, revealed that perturbation of the system via inactivation of the sk bprs or the rr bprr led to a reduction in virulence and reduced motility, as well as a wide range of gene expression changes. our results support the concept that b. pseudomallei tcsts regulatory networks can interact and show that selective perturbation of these systems can lead to attenuation of b. pseudomallei. together our results highlight the need for further systematic studies of b. pseudomallei tcsts regulation and show that targeting a single tcsts component can attenuate virulence.
