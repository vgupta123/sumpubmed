BACKGROUND
plants are attacked in nature by a diverse suite of biotic challenges from pathogens and herbivores which can be devastating. but when plants are attacked by pathogens and herbivores, they mount defense responses which can slow an herbivore's feeding and also the rate of disease spread. for example, in response to herbivore attack, plants produce a broad spectrum of defense compounds that are elicited by a jasmonic acid-dependent signaling pathway. tomato plants produce potent anti-herbivore defense metabolites such as proteinase inhibitors and polyphenoloxidase when attacked by spodoptera exigua  <cit> . in response to damage by the solanaceous specialist herbivore manduca sexta, nicotiana attenuata produces anti-herbivore defense metabolites such as nicotine  <cit> , caffeoyl putrescine, rutin, and diterpene glycoside  <cit> , as well as anti-digestive trypsin protease inhibitors   <cit> . on the other hand, plants infected with fungi, bacteria or viruses produce several types of pathogenesis-related proteins  belonging to at least  <dig> families  <cit> . most pr proteins are known to possess antimicrobial characteristics. for instance, pr- <dig>  of tobacco, barley, alfalfa and soybean have been shown to suppress diseases caused by phytophthora megasperma f. sp. medicaginins, rhizoctonia solani and alternaria alternata  <cit> . pr- <dig>  isolated from bean can suppress rhizoctonia solani in tobacco and canola when overexpressed  <cit> . pr-13/na-defensins in n. attenuata have been shown to suppress pseudomonas syrinage pvtomato-dc <dig>   <cit> .

these examples clearly suggest that depending on the type of the attacker, plants can produce different blends of defense metabolites. but in nature, plants often have to deal with not one but several natural enemies, and these can occur either simultaneously or one after the other, with one enemy facilitating or eliciting resistance to the attack of subsequent attackers. insects are also well-known vectors for pathogens  <cit> ; moreover, attack by rust fungi can influence subsequent herbivory in the same plant species  <cit> . the co-evolution of plants and their natural enemies makes it likely that plant responses related to one attacker have far-reaching consequences for subsequent attackers. plants often produce secondary metabolites with generalized detrimental effects on herbivores as well as pathogens. the phenolic compound rutin is such an example  <cit> . constitutive levels of iridoid glycosides among natural variants of plantago lanceolata have been shown to confer resistance to the herbivore spodoptera exigua as well as to the biotropic fungal pathogen diaporthe adunca  <cit> . recently it was shown that caterpillar feeding significantly reduced the extent of disease caused by the bacterial pathogens pst dc <dig> and xanthomonas campestris pvarmoraciae in arabidopsis  <cit> .

although many studies have shown that pathogen- and herbivore-elicited plant responses can have detrimental effects on subsequent attacker, few have established causal associations with the induction of a specific metabolite by the first attacker with a detrimental effect  on subsequent attacker. some studies have causally linked the signaling pathways that mediate effects against herbivores and pathogens  <cit> , others have found associations among the amounts of constitutively expressed metabolites  known to affect both herbivores and pathogens; but all these studies have been conducted with genotypes selected over generations for high- and low-leaf iridoid glycoside concentrations  <cit>  and are not iso-genic. therefore, they may differ in resistance traits other than the measured metabolites. as with constitutively produced metabolites, little is known about the cross effects of inducible defense metabolites.

here we 1) identify a defense metabolite  in wt n. attenuata that is elicited in response to attack from both pathogens and herbivores and 2) examine the consequences of this metabolite for both pathogen and herbivore resistance by comparing the resistance of wt and iso-genic plants transformed to silence the expression of the metabolite. n. attenuata, a solanaceous annual originating from the great basin desert or north america, dramatically increases nadefensin  levels when attacked by herbivores such as manduca sexta larvae  <cit> , tupiocorus notatus, myzus nicotianae, spodoptera littoralis and trichoplusia ni  <cit>  as well as the pathogen pst dc <dig>  <cit> . previous work from our lab has shown that wt n. attenuata plants silenced for nadefensin made wt plants increasingly susceptible to pst dc <dig>  <cit> . our main objectives were to study 1) the role of defensin in n. attenuata's induced resistance to m. sexta and 2) the influence of defensin on m. sexta growth when elicited by pst dc <dig> and vice versa. we began by observing the patterns of nadefensin expression in n. attenuata in response to m. sexta and pst dc <dig> and then studied the effect of nadefensin on m. sexta's resistance to plants that had been previously infected with pst dc <dig> as well as the effects of nadefensin on pst dc <dig> resistance when plants had been previously damaged by m. sexta.

RESULTS
gene expression analysis of nadefensin in wt and transgenic n. attenuata plants silenced for nadefensin
in n. attenuata, nadefensin  is up-regulated in wt n. attenuata plants after attack from m. sexta  <cit> , tupiocorus notatus, myzus nicotianae, spodoptera littoralis and trichoplusia ni  <cit>  larvae. bacteria  are also known to induce defensin in different plants  <cit> . recently, we reported that nadefensin was up-regulated  <dig> h after wt n. attenuata plants were infected with pst dc <dig>  <cit> ; moreover, silencing nadefensin by rnai by stable transformation  increased the plant's susceptibility to pst dc <dig>  <cit> .

while attack from both m. sexta larvae and pst dc <dig> is known to elicit nadefensin transcripts and protein in n. attenuata, the relative responses to m. sexta larvae and pst dc <dig> challenges were not known. we re-examined the levels of nadefensin transcripts accumulation in pst dc <dig> and m. sexta-attacked plants at a single time point . the quantitative real-time pcr  analysis  revealed that nadefensin transcript accumulation differed significantly across treatments and genotypes : nadefensin levels in wt plants infected with pst dc <dig> and in those attacked by m. sexta did not differ significantly . consistent with our earlier observation  <cit> , wt plants either damaged by m. sexta or infected by pst dc <dig> had significantly more  nadefensin transcripts compared to similarly treated irdefensin plants . the similar levels of nadefensin after m. sexta damage or pst dc <dig> infection suggest that nadefensin is likely elicited by jasmonates which are produced in response to pathogen infection as well as insect attack  <cit> .

effects of pst dc <dig> infection and nadefensin silencing on herbivore performance
since nadefensin is expressed in response to attack from both herbivores and pathogens, we asked if silencing nadefensin expression influenced m. sexta growth in uninduced plants as well as in plants previously inoculated with pst dc <dig>  we carried out assays on wt and nadefensin-silenced plants  which were either uninduced or had been infected  with pst dc <dig>  we measured two parameters that reflect the overall performance of m. sexta larvae: percentage of leaf area damage and larval mass gain.

percentage of leaf area damage
after  <dig> days of attack from a single m. sexta, leaves were evaluated for the percentage of leaf area damaged. m. sexta larvae removed significantly more leaf area from uninduced wt and irdefensin  plants  than from pst dc3000-infected plants . within the uninduced treatment, no significant differences in the percentage of leaf area damage between wt and irdefensin line  <dig>  plants or between wt and irdefensin line  <dig>  plants were observed . on the other hand, prior infection with pst dc <dig> resulted in greater leaf area losses  in wt plants compared to plants from both irdefensin lines .

larval mass gain
we also measured the mass of the larvae that fed on uninduced and on pst dc3000-infected wt and irdefensin  plants. anova revealed significant differences among the treatments and the genotypes , but the larval mass differences differed from those of the pattern leaf area damaged. no significant differences in larval mass between the m. sexta larvae that fed on the uninduced wt and those that fed on wt plants which were pst dc <dig> infected was observed . within the uninduced treatment, no statistical differences in the mass of larvae that fed on wt and irdefensin line  <dig>  plants or wt and irdefensin line  <dig>  plants were observed . on the other hand, larvae that fed on wt plants infected with pst dc <dig> gained significantly more  mass than did larvae that fed on infected plants from irdefensin line  <dig>  and irdefensin line  <dig> . the larvae that fed on pst dc3000-infected irdefensin  plants were smaller than the larvae that fed on pst dc3000-infected wt plants . the large variation in the larval mass across the experiment could be attributed to the differences in larvae's development which in turn may be attributed to high spatial heterogeneity in food quality for the larvae consuming infected leaves.

detecting pst dc <dig> from infected plants in herbivores' guts
in our earlier work, we reported that irdefensin  plants were more susceptible to pst dc <dig> than were wt n. attenuata plants, and as a result irdefensin  plants contained more pst dc <dig> colony forming units  than did the wt plants  <cit> . in this study we observed that m. sexta larvae that fed on irdefensin  plants were smaller and seemed to be infected with pathogens . therefore, we hypothesized that herbivores feeding on pst dc3000-infected irdefensin  plants might have ingested more pst dc <dig> than did the larvae feeding on the pst dc3000-infected wt plants, and that the number of ingested pst dc <dig> might negatively correlate with larval growth. we counted the cfus of plant-derived pst dc <dig> in guts  of larvae that fed either on pst dc3000-infected wt plants or pst dc3000-infected irdefensin plants  . as expected, we found pst dc <dig> colonies in larvae that fed on pst dc3000-infected wt and irdefensin  but none in larvae that fed on uninfected wt and irdefensin  plants. however, the number of pst dc <dig> colonies in the guts of larvae that fed on pst dc3000-infected wt or irdefensin  plants did not differ significantly . moreover, the overall number of cfus was very low relative to the number of cfus found in leaves, which suggests that plants infected with pst dc <dig> do not detrimentally affect larvae by directly transmitting pathogens to the herbivores. in addition to pst dc <dig>  we also detected a few unknown microorganisms with resistance to tetracycline and rifamycin . interestingly these unknown microorganisms were found most often in guts extracted from larvae that fed on irdefensin  plants. irdefensin  plants also show an increased susceptibility to the many opportunistic microorganisms which may be detrimental to larvae as well .

effects of herbivory and nadefensin silencing on pst dc <dig> infection
silencing nadefensin expression in n. attenuata does not influence the plant's resistance to m. sexta attack but lowers resistance to pst dc <dig>  <cit> , which suggests that nadefensin functions as an antibacterial defense protein in n. attenuata. we therefore explored whether nadefensin still functions as an antibacterial protein in leaves that are damaged by herbivores. we compared the level of disease progression of pst dc <dig> in leaves that were either undamaged or previously damaged  by m. sexta. two and four days after pst dc <dig> infection, leaves were evaluated for cfus. in general, we found that inoculating leaves of undamaged plants with pst dc <dig> or infecting leaves of m. sexta-damaged  plants with pst dc <dig> resulted in statistically significant differences in pst dc <dig> growth responses in n. attenuata . investigating the genotypic and treatment effects, we found the following patterns on day 4: 1) pst dc <dig> cfus were higher in both uninduced irdefensin line  <dig>  and line  <dig>  than in uninduced wt plants; 2) similarly, pst dc <dig> cfus were higher in m. sexta-damaged plants from both irdefensin lines  <dig>  and line  <dig>  than in wt plants; 3) within the wt plants, control plants  had higher titers of pst dc <dig> cfus  than did m. sexta-damaged plants; 4) within the irdefensin lines  the same effects of manduca damage were observed: control plants  had a higher titers of pst dc <dig> cfus,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, than did the m. sexta-damaged lines; 5) control wt plants  and m. sexta-damaged irdefensin lines  <dig> and  <dig> did not differ in pst dc <dig> cfus . in summary, these results suggest that na-defensin's anti-bacterial defense property is retained in leaves regardless of whether a leaf is elicited by pathogen or herbivore. in addition, m. sexta damage which results in the elicitation of a large set of anti-herbivory defense metabolites more effectively restricted pst dc <dig> growth than did elicitation by na-defensin alone.

discussion
two observations motivated us to study the direct and indirect roles of nadefensin in resistance to pathogens and herbivores in n. attenuata: 1) nadefensin levels are increased in n. attenuata in response to attack from these two natural enemies and 2) nadefensin is effective in resisting pst dc <dig> in n. attenuata but not herbivores  <cit> . therefore we asked: does nadefensin  have a function during herbivore attack? this question led us to ask if nadefensin indirectly affects interactions between m. sexta and pst dc <dig> 

the results demonstrate that pst dc3000-infection significantly reduces m. sexta's leaf consumption and growth; its effects are most dramatically seen in the nadefensin-silenced plants. since nadefensin-silenced plants are more susceptible than wt plants to pst dc <dig>  <cit> , we inferred that either the presence of pst dc <dig> in the larval diet or the altered leaf chemistry resulting from pst dc <dig> infection in nadefensin-silenced plants was responsible for the poor larval performance. larvae that fed on pst dc3000-infected wt plants, which are resistant to pst dc <dig>  consumed significantly more than those that fed on pst dc3000-infected nadefensin-silenced plants, which are highly susceptible to pst dc <dig> ; however, we found no difference in the titers of pst dc <dig> in the guts of the larvae  that had consumed either wt or nadefensin-silenced plants. we propose that changes in plant chemistry associated with differences in pst dc <dig> resistance negatively affect leaf consumption, but not the pathogen per se. this scenario is consistent with earlier studies in which tomato leaflets that had an increase in polyphenol oxidase after being infected by pst dc <dig> decreased the suitability of non-inoculated leaflets of the same leaf for helicoverpa zea  <cit> . interestingly, our results show that despite differences in leaf consumption between m. sexta that fed on either uninduced wt or nadefensin-silenced plants and those that fed on pst dc3000-infected wt plants, larvae nevertheless gained the same amount of body mass . since body mass is maintained at lower levels of consumption, pst dc <dig> infection of wt plants appears to increase the efficiency by which ingested food creates body mass for m. sexta larvae.

we noticed that larvae avoided consuming the portions of the leaf exhibiting disease symptoms  and found leaf consumption to be inversely related to the size of the disease lesions. why do larvae feeding on pst dc3000-infected wt plants gain more mass even when they consume less? plant responses to pathogen infection such as increased salicylic acid , which is produced in response to pst dc <dig> infection, could be involved  <cit> . several studies have shown that growth in herbivores is enhanced in plants that have elevated sa levels because sa can antagonize the oxylipin signaling which mediates herbivore resistance  <cit> . however, wt and nadefensin-silenced plants infected by pst dc <dig> have the same level of sa  <cit> , so other unmeasured changes in leaf chemistry are likely involved.

nadefensin can function as an anti-bacterial protein and is capable of inhibiting pst dc <dig> growth. since nadefensin is also induced after m. sexta damage  <cit> , we hypothesized that after herbivore damage nadefensin-silenced plants should also be susceptible to pst dc <dig>  indeed, nadefensin-silenced plants that were uninduced or previously damaged by m. sexta were more susceptible to pst dc <dig> than the wt plants that were uninduced or previously damaged by m. sexta, respectively. clearly, na-defensin functions as an anti-bacterial defense protein regardless of whether it is elicited by either pathogens or herbivores. moreover, it appears that herbivore-mediated cellular changes do not affect nadefensin's known anti-bacterial function. this is not surprising given the structure of the protein. nadefensin belongs to the γ-na-defensin class, which is 40– <dig> amino acids long, with  <dig> conserved cysteine residues that form  <dig> disulphide bridges; these disulphide bridges are thought to contribute to the stability of the protein. moreover, na-defensin is a cationic-basic protein and thus can be attracted to bacterial or fungal cell membranes, where it interacts directly  <cit> . we do not know exactly what feature of plant responses  towards pathogens or herbivores causes the induction of nadefensin, but plants may elicit nadefensin to prime their defense responses to possible bacterial damage. the wounds that herbivore feeding causes are likely entry points for many pathogens. this scenario is consistent with the lower pst dc <dig> growth in wt or nadefensin-silenced plants that were previously fed on by m. sexta compared to wt or nadefensin-silenced plants that were previously undamaged. m. sexta-damaged plants had reduced pst dc <dig> cfus, which is consistent with other studies reporting that herbivore-damaged plants may be less suitable for pathogens  <cit> . herbivore damage is associated with the production of several defense metabolites that can have detrimental effects on herbivores as well as pathogens. for instance, m. sexta damage increases nicotine production in n. sylvestris <cit>  and n. attenuata  <cit> , and nicotine was found to inhibit the growth of five species of pseudomonas bacterial pathogens  <cit> . similarly, many phenolic compounds such as rutin and chlorogenic acid are also produced in n. attenuata  <cit> . rutin, for instance, is a broad spectrum defense metabolite  <cit> . accordingly, after herbivory plants likely elicit herbivore-specific metabolites as well as anti-bacterial defense proteins such as defensin. the latter may be elicited in anticipation that the wounds created during herbivory might provide an opening for pathogenic bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
we studied the three-way interaction between a plant , an herbivore  and pathogenic bacteria  with reference to a known anti-bacterial defense protein, na-defensin. na-defensin was found to be effective in containing pst dc <dig> growth but ineffective in preventing m. sexta from feeding and gaining body mass. when the indirect effects of nadefensin on herbivore performance were analyzed in pst dc3000-infected wt leaves, we found that the increased expression of nadefensin increased resistance to pst dc <dig> and also reduced m. sexta's leaf consumption but not its larval mass gain. reduced nadefensin expression in pst dc3000-infected nadefensin-silenced plants decreased resistance to pst dc <dig> but hindered m. sexta's leaf consumption and its mass gain. when we analyzed the nadefensin-mediated responses in m. sexta-damaged leaves to pst dc <dig> resistance, we found that damage by m. sexta increased the resistance of both wt and nadefensin-silenced plants to pst dc <dig>  this enhanced resistance in m. sexta-damaged plants may result from the elicitation of a large set of anti-herbivory defense metabolites that can affect both herbivores as well as pathogens and to some specific anti-bacterial defense proteins such as defensin.
