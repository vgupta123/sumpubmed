BACKGROUND
acute myeloid leukemia  is a hematopoietic malignancy of clonal myeloid progenitor cells arrested at an immature differentiation stage. there is substantial phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity due to the acquisition of different genetic and/or epigenetic alterations in leukemia-initiating cells  <cit> . acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype  is a distinct biological entity, traditionally defined by the presence of at least three independent chromosome aberrations, excluding t, inv/t, and t and is associated with a very poor outcome  <cit> . more than  <dig> genes have been shown to be differentially expressed in ck-aml compared to aml with normal karyotype, including several genes located on 5q and 7q as well as genes involved in dna repair, chromosome segregation, and within the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . ck-aml often contains deletions of 5q, 7q, and 17p and shows high incidence of somatic alterations of tp53
.

besides these characteristic deletions, complex karyotypes frequently contain deletions of the chromosomal region 12p <dig> . the reported minimal deleted region of 12p <dig> spans two putative tumor suppressor genes, etv <dig> and cdkn1b
. for both genes, haploinsufficiency as the underlying mechanism was previously suggested, as they are located within the minimal deleted region and inactivation of the second allele is rarely seen  <cit> . furthermore, haploinsufficiency of cdkn1b is strongly implicated in numerous cancer types, the vast majority of lymphatic origin  <cit> .

etv <dig> , a member of the ets transcription factor family, shows several properties of a putative tumor suppressor gene like induction of g <dig> arrest and blocking of ras-induced transformation  <cit> , induction of apoptosis  <cit> , and activation of tp <dig> dependent pathways  <cit> . cdkn1b encodes the p27cdkn1b protein which belongs to the cip/kip class of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors and inactivates the cyclin e/cdk <dig> complex via binding of cdkn1b to cyclin e/cdk <dig>  <cit> . cdkn1b is hence an important negative regulator of the cell cycle.

in this study, we aimed to investigate whether and how etv <dig> and cdkn1b are inactivated by  deletions, mutations or dna methylation in the specific subgroup of ck-aml.

RESULTS
standard karyotyping and genomic profiling of 12p13
we extensively characterized a cohort of  <dig> patients with ck-aml. thirty-nine of them  showed a loss of 12p <dig> according to karyotyping . this included deletions of 12p <dig> due to interstitial deletions, unbalanced translocations, and monosomy  <dig>  a monosomy  <dig> was observed in  <dig> patients, a deletion of 12p <dig> either by interstitial or terminal deletion or by additive chromosomal material in  <dig> patients and a dicentric or derivative chromosome with loss of 12p in five patients. the frequency of cytogenetically detectable -5/5q-, -7/7q- or -17/17p- did not differ in the groups of ck-aml with and without 12p <dig> deletion .

in  <dig> patients, dna was available for genomic profiling  to determine the allelic status of 12p <dig> and delineate the breakpoints of 12p more closely. in  <dig> of these patients we used arraycgh methods , five patients were analyzed by using the snp 250 k array and  <dig> patients were analyzed by using the snp  <dig>  array. in summary, in  <dig> of  <dig> patients , losses of 12p <dig> could be identified by genomic profiling encompassing the etv <dig> and cdkn1b genes. with this approach, three patients were newly detected to carry a deletion in 12p <dig> , however in six patients  a loss of 12p <dig> according to karyotyping was not confirmed . small interstitial deletions within the chromosomal region 12p <dig> were identified in  <dig> of  <dig> patients with ck-aml analyzed by arraycgh and snp arrays. the distal breakpoints mapped within a region of 30 kb directly 5′ to etv <dig>  except in one patient , where the first deleted probe was localized in the 3′utr of etv <dig>  the proximal breakpoints were all downstream of gprc5d . the minimal deleted region in our cohort spanned  <dig>  mb and included cdkn1b and the 3′utr of etv <dig> .figure  <dig>

a graphic overview of the 12p <dig> deletion breakpoints including or excluding etv <dig> and cdkn1b from different studies also comprising our data is shown in figure  <dig>  most of these studies refer to  aml or contain a large number of patients with aml. some studies reported minimal deleted regions containing either etv <dig> or cdkn1b. however, in the majority of studies, the minimal deleted region covered both etv <dig> and cdkn1b.figure  <dig>

mutation analyses of etv <dig>  cdkn1band tp53
to further determine the modes of inactivation of etv <dig>  and cdkn1b , we performed mutation analyses of all coding exons of etv <dig> in  <dig> patients and of cdkn1b in  <dig> patients with and without 12p <dig> deletions for which dna was available . in our cohort of ck-aml, no cdkn1b mutations were identified. however, in etv <dig> we found a distinct and novel heterozygous frameshift mutation of exon  <dig>  c.391dupt, p. in one patient  . this frameshift mutation lies within the n-terminal homodimerization domain and theoretically would disturb homodimerization, thus leading to a complete loss of the dna-binding ets domain. a deleterious effect was confirmed by using the platform provean for non-synonymous or indel variants and prediction of functional effects   <cit> . the mutation was detected at the time point of relapse. importantly, in the first diagnostic sample of this patient still showing a normal karyotype, the etv <dig> mutation was present, indicating that this mutation emerged early in the course of the disease. in the following samples during the course of the disease, a complex karyotype with several balanced translocations and a terminal deletion of 14q was detected . by means of arraycgh, no gains or losses in the region of the etv <dig> gene were evident. notably, no tp <dig>  flt <dig> nor cebpa mutations  and no typical cytogenetic aberrations of ck-aml like del, -7/del, or del were present in this patient. however an npm <dig> mutation ) was identified .figure  <dig>

to determine the frequency of tp <dig> mutations in the subgroup with and without 12p <dig> deletions, we performed mutation analysis of all coding exons of tp <dig> in all  <dig> patients. in  <dig> of  <dig> patients , tp <dig> mutations were identified . the frequency of 12p <dig> alterations was similar in patients with and without a monoallelic or biallelic inactivation of tp <dig> .

methylation analyses of etv6and cdkn1b
to determine the methylation status of etv <dig> and cdkn1b, quantitative methylation analysis of the 5′utrs of both genes was performed by pyrosequencing. we examined  <dig> single cpg sites within the etv <dig> 5′utr cpg island and  <dig> single cpg sites within the cdkn1b 5′utr cpg island in  <dig> patients . the mean methylation levels of etv <dig> and cdkn1b ranged from 0% to  <dig> % and  <dig> % to  <dig> %, respectively . these results did not exceed the cut-off levels of 5% indicative for increased methylation. neither did the methylation degree of single cpg sites in the patients exceed the cut-off level. in summary, no evidence of increased methylation of the 5′utr of either gene was found.figure  <dig>

expression profiling of the genes within the minimal deleted region
as we showed that gene dosages of etv <dig> and cdkn1b were reduced to half the normal level in ck-aml samples with 12p <dig> deletion, we were interested to determine whether this is reflected on the transcriptional level. therefore, we first evaluated the gene dosage effect based on our previously published gene expression profiling  <cit> . expression and genomic data were available for four of our own patients with ck-aml and deletion in 12p <dig> and for  <dig> cases without deletion in 12p <dig>  the four ck-aml patients with deletion in 12p <dig> showed a significantly lower expression level for the deleted genes than ck-aml without deletion in 12p <dig> . within the four cases with 12p <dig> deletion we compared the expression level of the genes located in the critical region with those on chromosome  <dig> outside the deleted region and found a lower expression level for the deleted genes .figure  <dig>

in addition, we screened the publicly available data of the cancer genome atlas  for ck-aml patients with and without deletion in 12p <dig>  we compared eight cases of ck-aml with deletion in 12p <dig> and eight cases of ck-aml without deletion in 12p <dig>  etv <dig> and cdkn1b are expressed in ck-aml with and without deletion in 12p <dig> . notably, the expression level of etv <dig> and cdkn1b decreased significantly by  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold , respectively, in cases with 12p <dig> deletions compared to those without 12p <dig> deletions. the other candidate genes located within the minimal deleted region  showed no or very low expression levels irrespective of their copy number status  .

discussion
12p <dig> deletions are common in a broad spectrum of hematological malignancies, notably in myelodysplastic syndrome  with monosomy  <dig>  <cit>  and ck-aml . etv <dig> and cdkn1b are the candidate tumor suppressor genes within the region 12p <dig>  <cit> . other candidate genes within the minimal deleted region like bcl2l <dig>  lrp <dig>  dusp <dig> and gprc5d may also play a role in tumorigenesis and leukemogenesis.

however, we now demonstrate according to the expression data provided by tcga in confirmation of data published by haferlach et al, that these genes do not show any expression or very low expression in blood or bone marrow cells of aml patients  <cit> . likewise, using the platform hemaexplorer , they show a low expression in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, compared to the expression level of etv <dig>  and cdkn1b  in these cells  <cit> . it seems unlikely that they play a major role in leukemogenesis . recent data suggest that the function of some tumor suppressor genes can be disrupted solely by haploinsufficiency leading to reduced gene dosage which might be sufficient to contribute to tumorigenesis . popular examples are tp <dig>  pten, npm <dig>  nf <dig> and rps14
 <cit> . likewise, for the genes apc, atm, brca1/ <dig> and rb haploinsufficiency contributes to tumorigenesis  <cit> . haploinsufficiency of cdkn1b is strongly implicated in numerous cancer types, the vast majority of lymphatic origin  <cit> . cdkn1b heterozygous mice are predisposed to tumors in multiple tissues  <cit> . etv <dig> and cdkn1b are known to be inactivated mostly by monoallelic deletions. yet, the mode of inactivation has not been investigated in detail in ck-aml with a high frequency of 12p <dig> deletions.

in our study, 12p <dig> deletions, mostly small interstitial deletions, were present in nearly half  of the analyzed ck-aml patients according to karyotype. in  <dig> of  <dig> patients , losses of 12p <dig> could be identified by genomic profiling, of those  <dig> small interstitial deletions . the high frequency may be explained by high-resolution arrays used in this study. in previous studies based on karyotyping or snp arrays of lower resolution, the frequency of 12p <dig> deletions in ck-aml was 27%  <cit>  and 18%  <cit> , respectively. however, it cannot be excluded that the rather high frequency in our study is due to the relatively small size of our cohort. the minimal deleted region in our cohort spanned  <dig>  mb and included cdkn1b and the 3′utr of etv <dig> . in one patient  the distal breakpoint is located within a region between exon  <dig> and the 3′utr of the etv <dig> gene. as the end of the ets dna-binding domain and the highly conserved polyadenylation signal lay within the deleted region and differential polyadenylation of the 3′utr of etv <dig> plays a major role in posttranscriptional modification  <cit> , we assume that etv <dig> is contained in the minimal deleted region.

etv <dig> and cdkn1b mutations have never been investigated specifically in ck-aml. somatic etv <dig> mutations are rare events in newly diagnosed aml  <cit> , aml-m <dig>  <cit>  and mds  <cit> . we detected one heterozygous frameshift mutation among  <dig> patients . our results thereby confirm the low rate of etv <dig> mutations in the distinct subgroup of ck-aml. the detected frameshift mutation lies within the n-terminal homodimerization domain leading to a complete loss of the dna-binding ets domain. the vast majority of all reported etv <dig> mutations results in inactivation of one etv <dig> allele which is consistent with haploinsufficiency as the underlying mechanism. there was no typical driver alteration like tp <dig> or flt <dig> mutations and no typical cytogenetic aberrations of ck-aml like del, -7/del, or del present in this patient, which could provide a proliferative advantage or even initiate leukemogenesis. this might strengthen the role of this etv <dig> mutation as a driver rather than a passenger mutation. unfortunately, no fibroblast dna was available to prove whether the etv <dig> mutation was of germline origin. however, this seems to be unlikely as etv <dig> is a critical regulator in the survival of multiple cell types during early embryonic development and etv <dig> knockout mice are embryonically lethal  <cit> .

according to the literature, cdkn1b mutations have been previously reported in childhood leukemia  <cit>  and rarely in t-cell prolymphocytic leukemia  <cit>  as well as in adult t-cell leukemia  <cit> . we did not identify a mutation in the cdkn1b gene in our analyzed patient cohort .

as expected, in more than half of the analyzed patients, tp <dig> mutations were detected . however, the frequency of 12p <dig> deletions did not differ between patients with and without a monoallelic or biallelic alteration of tp <dig> .

one mechanism of haploinsufficiency is increased methylation leading to reduced gene dosage due to transcriptional silencing. for etv <dig>  increased methylation was suggested as a possible mechanism since decreased etv <dig> protein expression was reported in aml patients  <cit> . hypermethylation of cdkn1b was excluded in not further defined aml and mds, but found in the lymphoblast-like cell line raji  <cit> . we demonstrate here that the cpg islands within the etv <dig> and cdkn1b 5′utrs are not hypermethylated in ck-aml . to our knowledge, this is the first report that excludes 5′utr methylation leading to etv <dig> and cdkn1b inactivation in ck-aml and supports haploinsufficiency by heterozygous deletions as mode of inactivation.

we show by reanalysis of our previously published gene expression profiling  <cit>  of patients with ck-aml and deletion in 12p <dig> a significantly lower expression level for the deleted genes  compared to a group of ck-aml patients without 12p <dig> alteration . furthermore, we screened the publicly available data of tcga and demonstrate that the other candidate genes located within the minimal deleted region  show no or very low expression levels irrespective of their copy number. in contrast, etv <dig> and cdkn1b are expressed in ck-aml and their expression levels significantly decreased in cases with 12p <dig> deletions . thus, etv <dig> and cdkn1b are the sole genes within the minimal deleted region with expression levels reduced to approximately half. these data strongly support our hypothesis that haploinsufficiency is the underlying mechanism of inactivation of etv <dig> and cdkn1b.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrate that the putative tumor suppressor genes etv <dig> and cdkn1b are frequently inactivated by loss of one copy, most frequently by small deletions of 12p <dig>  in ck-aml. the expression level of etv <dig> and cdkn1b is significantly decreased in cases with 12p <dig> deletions whereas the other potential candidate genes within the minimal deleted region do not show any or very low expression irrespective of their copy number status. mutations and hypermethylation as mode of inactivation were largely excluded. it is possible that the genomic complexity leads to acquisition of the deletion in 12p <dig>  future studies investigating clonal evolution should clarify, whether haploinsufficiency of both genes may cooperate early in the process of leukemic transformation by disordering key processes of differentiation and proliferation and whether they may also play a critical role in the induction of chromosomal instability finally resulting in the development of clones with complex karyotypes.
