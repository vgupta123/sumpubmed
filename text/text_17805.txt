BACKGROUND
stenotrophomonas maltophilia, previously named as pseudomonas maltophilia and then xanthomonas maltophilia <cit> , is an aerobic, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium common in different environments. s. maltophilia can cause various types of nosocomial infections, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in severely immunocompromised and debilitated patients  <cit> . this organism is increasingly prevalent in hospitals worldwide; in taiwan, it is ranked one of the highest occurring nosocomial infections  <cit> . in addition, isolates obtained from hospitalized patients show significant genetic diversity, suggesting that they can be derived from various sources  <cit> . recently, treatment of s. maltophilia infections has become more difficult because of the high prevalence of multiple resistance to antibiotics of this organism  <cit> .

phage therapy has attracted significant attention for its effectiveness in treating bacterial infections  <cit> . some s. maltophilia phages have been reported including i) two lytic phages  from our laboratory that resemble members of myoviridae in morphology with a genome of approximately  <dig> and 160 kb, respectively  <cit> , ii) a t7-like phage lytic to pan-resistant s. maltophilia and a phage that has large burst size and unique plaque polymorphism, with their genomes being sequenced  <cit> , iii) a phage remnant in s. maltophilia strain p <dig> that is capable of producing a novel phage tail-like bacteriocin, designated as maltocin p <dig>  <cit> , iv) detection of a phage genome carrying a zonula occludens like toxin gene  <cit> , and v) three filamentous phages  <cit> . in addition, we have described a novel lysozyme encoded by a xanthomonas oryzae phage, phixo <dig>  that is active against both xanthomonas and stenotrophomonas <cit> . although the lytic phages, the lysozyme and the maltocin p <dig> are potentially useful in treating s. maltophilia infection, feasible testing has yet been reported.

in spite of the above mentioned efforts in phage study, no temperate phage of s. maltophilia has been reported. in this study, we isolated a temperate phage of s. maltophilia and designated as smp <dig>  since acquisition of external dna by horizontal gene transfer and gene loss are major driving-forces of bacterial genome evolution and integration and excision of temperate bacteriophages contribute actively to such evolution  <cit> , we deemed it worthy to study this phage. the phage genome was sequenced and sequence analysis revealed that smp <dig> is similar to phage p <dig> and shares high degrees of identity with prophages of stenotrophomonas and xanthomonads.

RESULTS
phage smp <dig> is a temperate myophage infecting s. maltophilia
in this study, temperate phages were detected by spotting culture supernatants from  <dig> clinical isolates of s. maltophilia onto lawns formed separately by all other isolates. the culture supernatant from s. maltophilia strain t <dig> was observed to cause clearing zones on  <dig> of the samples . following  <dig> rounds of single plaque isolation, smp <dig> was obtained and used for further study. less turbid plaques were formed on lawns of strain t16; therefore, this strain was used as the host for phage propagation and indicator host in titering the phage.

cultures of s. maltophilia t <dig> released from 1 ×  <dig> to 1 ×  <dig> pfu/ml of smp <dig> and treatment by adding mitomycin c  into the cultures produced titers of approximately 7 ×  <dig> pfu/ml. electron microscopy showed that smp <dig> has an icosahedral head approximately 60 nm in diameter and a contractile tail 100–120 nm in length and 20–30 nm in width , resembling members of myoviridae phages.

in sds-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis, phage particles purified by cscl ultracentrifugation displayed more than  <dig> distinct protein bands, with molecular masses ranging from  <dig> to 120 kda, upon staining the gel with coomassie brilliant blue. four bands, with molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and 21 kda, were more abundant than the others. the 38-kda protein was the most abundant and is likely the major capsid protein.

host range testing showed that only the three s. maltophilia strains, atcc  <dig>  bcrc  <dig>  and t <dig>  were sensitive to smp <dig> as indicated by the formation of single plaques. several reasons are possible for the phage resistance, including immunity, impaired adsorption and block at later stages during phage infection, and further study is needed to test these possibilities. with such a narrow host range, smp <dig> apparently has limited use in control of s. maltophilia infection. spot tests and plaque assays were also tested on bacteria other than s. maltophilia strains, including escherichia coli , serratia marcescens , enterobacter cloacae , klebsiella pneumoniae , proteus mirabilis , pseudomonas aeruginosa , xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris , x. axonopodis pv. citri , x. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae , x. axonopodis pv. glycines , x. axonopodis pv. phaseoli , x. axonapodis pv. vesicatoria , and x. oryzae pv. oryzae . none of these bacteria were sensitive to smp <dig>  indicating that this phage has a narrow host range. this is different from phage p <dig> that can infect several enteric bacterial species  <cit> .

the circular smp <dig> genome has a cohesive region conserved in p2-like phages
restriction endonucleases avai, ecori, ecorv, hincii, kpni, ncoi, noti, psti, pvuii, and sphi were tested and found to be capable of cutting the smp <dig> genomic dna into distinct fragments. sequencing of the smp <dig> genome showed  <dig>  bp, and  <dig> orfs were identified . nucleotide sequence comparison revealed that smp <dig> had a region similar to the 55-bp cos region conserved in p <dig> and the related phages required for phage packaging  <cit> ; gc-rich 19-nt 5′-extruding cohesive ends  similar to those of p2-related phages  were observed in the cos region of smp <dig>   <cit> . by analogy to the p <dig> case, the extruding regions were set as the ends of the smp <dig> genome.

the circularity of the smp <dig> genome was demonstrated as follows. as shown in additional file 2: figure s1a, when displayed in a circular form, the left- and right-hand 19-nt extruding ends of the smp <dig> genome would be paired. the genome had  <dig> ecori and  <dig> ecorv sites, which were numbered from e <dig> to e <dig> and v <dig> to v <dig>  respectively. based on this predicted map, we isolated and sequenced a  <dig>  kb ecori fragment . results showed that this fragment was 2501-bp long, identical in nucleotide sequence to the e6-e <dig> region in the genome, and indeed contained the 19-bp cos site. to confirm circularity of the genome, fragment v12-e <dig> was used as the probe for southern hybridization to probe a  <dig> -kb ecorv fragment . as anticipated, a  <dig> -kb fragment was detected in the hybridization . these results indicate that smp <dig> has a circular genome.

smp <dig> is similar to prophages in stenotrophomonas and xanthomonas
sequence analysis shows that smp <dig> shares similarity with several prophages in genome organization and encoded proteins. they included 1) a 27-kb prophage remnant in x. axonopodis pv. citri strain 306; 2) a prophage each in x. campestris pv. campestris strain atcc <dig>  and x. oryzae pv. oryzae strains kacc <dig> , maff <dig>  and pxo99a ; and 3) a 35-kb prophage in s. maltophilia k279a . additionally, most smp131-encoded proteins were similar to those encoded by several p2-like temperate phages .

similarity between smp <dig> and prophages in xanthomonas and stenotrophomonas can be summarized as follows . first, genomes of these prophages  were slightly larger than that of smp <dig> , suggesting that some insertions in these prophages  and deletions  from smp <dig> had occurred during evolution. most of these in/dels encode hypothetical proteins. it is apparent that those absent from smp <dig> are nonessential genes. second, some smp <dig> genes  were absent from one or more of the other prophages . third, there were transposase genes associated with the xanthomonas prophages and remnant : 1) two in the upstream region and three in the downstream flanking region of the remnant, 2) four in the downstream flanking region of x. oryzae pv. oryzae kacc <dig> prophage, 3) one in the upstream flanking region and three in the upstream of x. oryzae pv. oryzae pxo99a prophage, and 4) five in the downstream flanking region of x. oryzae pv. oryzae maff <dig> prophage. fourth, identity in amino acid sequence between corresponding proteins of smp <dig> and these prophages ranged between 30% and 94%, with the majority falling above 50% . however, because none of their encoded proteins had been characterized, sequence comparison with proteins of these prophages did not lead to the identification of smp <dig> gene functions.

among the prophage harboring strains of stenotrophomonas and xanthomonas, x. campestris pv. campestris atcc <dig> was the only strain available to us. spot test showed that the culture supernatant from x. campestris pv. campestris atcc <dig> did not form lysis zones on lawns of x. campestris pv. campestris strains xc <dig> and xc <dig>  indicating that this strain may not release phage particles.

the majority of smp131-encoded proteins are similar to those of p2-like phages
no homologues were identified for proteins encoded by orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> in the database, whereas orf <dig> and orf <dig> encoded a site-specific dna methyltransferase and a hypothetical protein, respectively. cluster orf <dig> to orf <dig> encoding capsid and packaging proteins was organized in the same order as p <dig> genes qponml; orf <dig> was similar to p <dig> gene x, annotated as tail protein .

proteins encoded by orf <dig> and orf <dig> possessed three transmembrane domains similar to class i holins  <cit> . the product of orf <dig> had a highly charged c terminus, which is characteristic of members of class i, whereas orf <dig> contained a slightly lower charged c terminus. orf <dig> was assigned as the endolysin gene. rather than sharing similarity with phage lysozymes, the orf <dig> product had a motif  highly conserved in members of the gh <dig> chitinases family, -g-r-g--x-q------ny, that forms the substrate binding region  <cit>  . moreover, glu50/glu <dig> of orf <dig> were similar to glu68/glu <dig> of streptomyces coelicolor chitinase g experimentally identified as the active sites  <cit> . family gh <dig> chitinases have long been identified in plants  <cit>  and recently in bacteria  <cit> , although not in phages; this smp <dig> enzyme appears to be the first reported for phages.

proteins encoded by orf <dig> and orf <dig> were homologous to r and s of p <dig>  the tail completion proteins essential for stable head joining  <cit> . proteins encoded by orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig> were homologous to that of the p <dig> j, i, v, and w , respectively, whereas the position of orf <dig> and orf <dig> is similar to that of p <dig> h and g. among the p <dig> genes, vwji code for baseplate assembly proteins; h for putative tail fiber protein; and g for probable tail fiber assembly protein  <cit> . the difference in gene order suggests that rearrangement of these genes had occurred during evolution.

orf <dig> to orf <dig>  except orf <dig> that encoded a possible membrane protein, encoded tail proteins, whereas orf <dig> encoded a late gene control protein. these genes corresponded to the p <dig> operon f

ee’tud . in p <dig>  e’ overlaps the start of gene t, lacks a potential ribosome binding site, and extends  <dig> nt back into e in the - <dig> reading frame. a run of 6 t residues  was located  <dig> nt upstream of the possible gug start of e’ and an extension of gene e following a - <dig> translational frameshift has been designated as e + e’ <cit> . the arrangement of e and e’ genes within the tail gene cluster and their coupling through a translational frameshift is conserved among p2-related phages as well as in several other phages such as lambda although they share no similarity in amino acid sequence  <cit> . near the 3′-end of orf <dig>  there is a t7g similar to the conserved t6g slippery sequence  <cit> , nt 288– <dig> relative to the orf <dig> start codon. thus, by analogy, a - <dig> translational frameshift may occur here during translation, thereby producing a protein product of orf <dig>  . instead of the t7g, a predicted t7c slippery sequence was observed in the corresponding tail genes of prophages of s. maltophilia k279a, x. campestris pv. campestris  <dig>  x. oryzae pv. oryzae strains kacc <dig>  maff <dig>  and pxo99a . these findings indicate that this type of arrangement may be conserved in all p2-like phages.

the protein predicted for orf <dig> was a phage-related protein similar to gp <dig> of phage bcepmu; orf <dig> encoded a protein similar to that of p <dig> regulatory protein ogr ; the products predicted for orf35- <dig> were all hypothetical proteins, except that orf <dig> and orf <dig> encoded a dna primase-like protein and a tyrosine family integrase, respectively. tyrosine family integrases are responsible for dna cleavage, strand exchange, and religation steps with a covalently bound phosphotyrosine intermediate  <cit> . as shown in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  similarity search based on domain architecture  <cit>  and sequence alignments showed that the predicted protein of orf <dig> possessed  <dig> residues of the pentad conserved residues  and the possible catalytic site tyr <dig> . however, no significant similarity in amino acid sequence was observed between the n-terminal region of smp <dig> integrase and those of other integrases.

varied degrees of identity were shared by smp <dig> proteins with the analogous proteins from phages encompassing a wild host range . these homologues include  <dig> encoded by pseudomonas phage phictx ,  <dig> by burkholderia phage kl <dig> , and  <dig> by enterobacteria phage p <dig> . the majority of these homologues cluster within the regions coding for capsid and packaging proteins  as well as tail related proteins . the cluster encoding lysis related proteins  and the phage tail fiber protein  shared lower degrees of identity, while orf <dig>  shared no appreciable homology. the very recently reported p2-like phage remnant in s. maltophilia strain p <dig> possesses  <dig> orfs  <cit> , nine of the deduced proteins share 31% to 53% identities with the smp <dig> encoded proteins .

smp <dig> late genes may be regulated in a manner similar to that in p2
p <dig> has four late promoters, pp, po, pv, and pf, possessing the consensus sequence tgt-n12-aca and controlling pq, onmlkrs, vwjihg, and f

ee’tud operons, respectively  <cit> . transcription of these operons depends on the ogr protein, a zinc-finger containing transcriptional activator with a conserved cysteine motif, cx2cx22cx4c, where a zinc atom coordinates with four cysteine residues  <cit> . in smp <dig>  four putative late promoters were observed with sequences similar to tgt-n12-aca, which were designated as pp’, po’, pj’, and pv’ located at nt 4398– <dig>  4381– <dig>   <dig> - <dig> , and  <dig> - <dig>  in the genome, respectively . operons presumably controlled by pp’ and po’ were analogous to those by p <dig> pp and po, respectively, but those by pj’ and pv’ had some exchanged members due to gene rearrangement, that is, vwjihg and f

ee’tud in p <dig> versus orf19-orf <dig>  and orf23-orf <dig> in smp <dig> . additionally, the protein encoded by smp <dig> orf <dig>  which had a relative position similar to that of the p <dig> ogr gene, had a conserved cx2cx22cx4c motif, although overall similarity shared by the two proteins was low. thus, similarity in genome organization, promoter sequence, and a regulatory protein suggests that smp <dig> late genes are regulated in a manner similar to that in p <dig> 

trna genes are the preferred sites for integration of p2-like prophages of xanthomonas and stenotrophomonas
it is known that in e. coli i) p <dig> can integrate at over  <dig> different loci, with loci  being preferred over any other sites in e. coli c, ii) this site is occupied by a remnant of a p <dig> prophage in e. coli k- <dig> and p <dig> therefore will integrate into secondary sites, and iii) the p <dig> integrase accepts at least up to 37% mismatches within the core sequence  <cit> . searching for a region similar to the p <dig> attp site in smp <dig> genome revealed no such region. we then turned to identify putative attr and attl at the ends of prophage sequences from stenotrophomonas and xanthomonas and observed a 46-nucleotide perfect direct repeat at the extremities of the integrated prophage of s. maltophilia k279a, apparently representing attl and attr of the prophage . this 46-nucleotide sequence corresponded to the 3′-end of an intact trna-thr gene. nucleotide sequence comparison showed that a region identical to the att regions of the s. maltophilia k279a prophage was present in bp  <dig> - <dig>   of the smp <dig> genome . this region, situated downstream of the integrase gene and similar in location to those in p2-like phages , was thus predicted to be the attp site for smp <dig> .

based on the position of attp, we predicted that upon integration via attp, orf <dig> and orf <dig> would become flanked by attl and attr, respectively. in addition, an naei and a hincii restriction sites were located 644 bp and 667 bp relative to the orf <dig> and orf <dig> start codons, respectively, in the smp <dig> genome . sequencing revealed that the amplicons were  <dig>  bp and 704 bp containing attl and attr, respectively, which had a sequence identical to that of the smp <dig> attp. to verify the att-flanking sequences, primers l3/l <dig> and r2/r <dig> were used to amplify the junctions of attl and attr regions, respectively . sequencing of these  <dig> replicons confirmed that our inverse pcr reactions had faithfully amplified the targeted regions. the result revealed that a segment of a possible defective integrase gene  downstream of the attl was similar to that of burkholderia thailandensis e <dig> , whereas a 177-bp long host chromosomal region upstream of the attr was highly similar to the sequence adjacent to the trna-thr of s. maltophilia strains . these results suggest that upstream regions of trna-thr are conserved in different strains of s. maltophilia, whereas the downstream regions are not. it was also noticed that upon integration, an intact trna-thr that included the attr was regained, similar to the target site duplication observed by rocco et al.  <cit> .

in addition to s. maltophilia strain k279a , the genome sequence has been determined for strain r551- <dig>   <cit> ; they each had only one copy of trna-thr located near one o’clock relative to the origin of chromosome replication , as identified by containing dnaa boxes and genes involved in the initiation of bacterial chromosome replication  <cit> . therefore, it is highly probable that this trna-thr is the preferred site for smp <dig> integration. sequence analysis of junctions of integrated xanthomonas prophage suggests that 1) prophages of x. campestris pv. campestris strain atcc <dig>  and x. oryzae pv. oryzae strains maff <dig> and kacc <dig> integrated into a 45-bp region corresponding to 3′-end of a trna-lys gene , 2) prophage of x. oryzae pv. oryzae pxo99a integrated into a 46-bp region corresponding to the 3′ end of a trna-asn , and 3) prophage remnant of x. axonopodis pv. citri  <dig> used the same sequence  as that of x. oryzae pv. oryzae pxo99a prophage for integration, except that only attl was retained . all identified attb sites for xanthomonas are also located near one o’clock on the bacterial chromosomes.

host integration of p2-like phages involves binding of integrase to the two arm-binding sites flanking the imperfect repeat, each having two direct repeats  <cit> . careful examination of the smp <dig> sequence revealed a pair of perfect direct repeats  and an inverted repeat  in the upstream of attp , but no such sequences were found between attp and orf <dig>  by analogy, it is possible that these repeats are involved in recognition by smp <dig> integrase for host integration. however, lack of conserved repeats in the downstream suggests that the smp <dig> integrase may be less demanding for sequence conservation in the downstream region for the function.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to isolate a temperate phage of s. maltophilia, smp <dig>  it is identified as a p2-like phage based on similarities to p <dig> in amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins, genomic organization, arrangement of several operons, and possession of a slippery sequence t7g for translational frameshifting in tail assembly genes. smp <dig> is able to infect only s. maltophilia, different from phage p <dig> that can infect several enteric bacterial species. several p2-like prophages in s. maltophilia and xanthomonads are also identified by bioinformatic analyses. in contrast to p <dig> that can integrate into several loci of the host chromosome, with certain loci being favoured and none of them being t-rna gene, single t-rna genes are found to be the locus for integration of these stenotrophomonas and xanthomonads prophages. in addition, the regions flanking the prophages are rich in transposase-like genes, suggesting frequent exchange of genes during evolution. existence of closely related prophages in stenotrophomonas and xanthomonads is consistent with the close relatedness of these bacteria and the previous classification including stenotrophomonas in genus xanthomonas. prevalence of the phages may have contributed to diversity of these closely related species owing to possible horizontal gene transfer mediated by the phages. with a narrow host range, the value to use smp <dig> for controlling s. maltophilia infection is apparently limited.
