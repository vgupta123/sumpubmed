BACKGROUND
the amount of noncoding dna  in organelle genomes varies significantly. one evolutionary lineage where the gamut of organelle-genome compactness is particularly pronounced is the chlorophyta  for which the noncoding-dna contents span from 10%  to 53%  for mitochondrial dna  and from 5%  to 56%  for plastid dna . although the processes influencing genome compactness are poorly understood, it is suggested that they are associated with the proliferation of selfish dna  <cit> , which we will define for the purpose of this study as any noncoding dna element with the ability to spread its sequence to new genomic locations. selfish dna is ubiquitous in eukaryotic nuclear genomes and is also present, though less pervasive, in organelle genomes  <cit> , including those of chlorophytes  <cit>  – and see hurst and werren  <cit>  for a review.

one proposed type of selfish dna that is often observed in the mitochondrial and plastid genomes of chlorophytes are short palindromic repeats; these repetitive elements are marked by their short length  and their ability to be folded into hairpin  structures. short palindromic repeats have been identified in the mtdna and ptdna from a variety of chlorophyte taxa , and there are indications that the organelle genomes of some chlorophyte species are more prone to the dissemination of palindromic repeats than those of other chlorophyte species. for example, the mtdna of p. akinetum, the largest chlorophyte mitochondrial genome sequenced to date , contains a series of short palindromic repeats that have proliferated throughout its intergenic and intronic regions  <cit> ; moreover, these same palindromic elements are found in the noncoding regions of the p. akinetum ptdna  <cit> , indicating that the lateral transfer of repetitive dna between organelle compartments is taking place – it is speculated that this process involves the hitchhiking of repeats on introns that migrate between the mtdna and ptdna  <cit> . short palindromic repeats in chlorophyte organelle dna, as well as adding to the amount of noncoding dna in a genome, have been credited for: 1) genome rearrangements  <cit> , including the fragmentation and scrambling of ribosomal-rna  coding modules  <cit> ; 2) changes in genome conformation and chromosome number  <cit> ; and 3) having regulatory functions  <cit> .

a previous study found that the mitochondrial genome of the multicellular, chlorophyte green alga volvox carteri, a close relative to c. reinhardtii, is profuse with short palindromic repeats  <cit> . by sequencing ~ <dig> kb of mtdna, corresponding to portions of cob, cox <dig>  and their group-i introns, and an intergenic region between nad <dig> and nad <dig>  these authors showed that at least two group-i introns and one intergenic region of the v. carteri mitochondrial genome contain extensive palindromic sequences. ten classes of short palindromic repeats, all of which share sequence identity with one another, were discerned. aono et al.  <cit>  concluded that these repetitive elements are selfish dna, that they are expanding the intronic and intergenic regions of the mitochondrial genome, and that they may have played a role in the fragmentation of rrna-coding modules.

in june  <dig>  the united states department of energy joint genome institute  released the draft nuclear genome sequence of v. carteri  <cit> . this genome is ~ <dig> megabases  in length  <cit> , which is the largest chlorophyte nuclear genome sequence currently available , and the preliminary annotation of this sequence suggests that it is rich in noncoding dna, much of which appears to be selfish  <cit> .

our interest regarding the evolution of selfish dna in v. carteri was sparked when we located short palindromic repeats in the v. carteri draft nuclear genome sequence that are similar to those in the mtdna. to see if palindromic repeats are also present in the v. carteri ptdna, we pcr amplified and sequenced an intergenic region from the plastid genome; our analysis of this sequence confirmed that the ptdna contains palindromic repeats that have a similar size and potential secondary structure to those in the mitochondrial compartment. we, therefore, set out to do a detailed investigation of the palindromic repeats in v. carteri by sequencing and characterizing large portions of mtdna and ptdna and then comparing these data to the nuclear dna . our motives for this study are to gain insights into the role selfish dna plays in organelle-genome expansion and its ability to move between genetic compartments.

RESULTS
general features of the mitochondrial- and plastid-dna sequences from v. carteri
using a long-range pcr approach in conjunction with cloning, we sequenced from v. carteri  <dig>  nt of the mitochondrial genome and  <dig>  nt of the plastid genome; partial genetic maps of these genomes describing the coding and noncoding regions that were sequenced are respectively shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  regions of the v. carteri organelle dna that were previously characterized  are highlighted in pink on these maps. although we attempted to completely sequence the mitochondrial and plastid genomes, presumed secondary structures in the mtdna and ptdna templates likely caused many of the sequencing reactions to suddenly stop – even when using protocols designed to alleviate this problem  <cit> . furthermore, the repetitive nature of the organelle genomes means that much of the mtdna and ptdna sequence data are irresolvable using the currently available genome-assembly software programs: many of the organelle intergenic and intronic dna sequences collapse into networks of spurious repetitive motifs upon assembly. moreover, the fact that most of the mtdna and ptdna intergenic regions are much longer than a typical sequencing read  means that these collapsed repeats are irresolvable. at present, the most sophisticated assembly programs use the paired-end sequencing data from whole-genome shotgun reads to resolve complex repeat regions. because there is a v. carteri nuclear genome sequencing project  <cit> , we have access to paired-end sequencing reads for the mitochondrial and plastid genomes ; but even with these data, neither the assembly programs nor our own manual, by-eye assembly methods can untangle these repeats. because of these difficulties, our v. carteri mitochondrial-genome assembly, although contained in a single contig, contains six regions where the mtdna sequence is either unreadable or unavailable , and the assembly of the ptdna is divided into  <dig> contigs . nevertheless, we did sequence and characterize enough mtdna and ptdna to confidently describe the abundance and various types of noncoding dna in each of these organelle genomes.

the organelle-dna sequences presented in this study were validated by collecting and assembling mtdna and ptdna sequence data that were generated by the doe jgi v. carteri nuclear genome sequencing project  <cit> . this was performed by: 1) downloading dna-sequence trace files corresponding to the v. carteri mitochondrial and plastid genomes; 2) assembling these trace files into contigs; and 3) mapping the trace-file contigs to the v. carteri mtdna and ptdna sequences produced in this study. ultimately, the mtdna and ptdna sequences coming from the doe jgi covered all of our self-generated v. carteri sequence data with >50-fold redundancy. it is important to note that the doe jgi data that we used to confirm our mtdna and ptdna sequences came from v. carteri strain hk <dig> , whereas the v. carteri mtdna and ptdna sequences that we generated came from strain 72- <dig> , which is a dissociator mutant derived from hk <dig>  <cit> . in all instances, the organelle dna sequence data coming from strain hk <dig> were identical to those of strain 72- <dig> , with the exception of a group-i intron that is present in the mtdna of hk <dig> but absent in that of 72- <dig> .

of the  <dig>  nt of v. carteri mtdna sequence data presented here,  <dig>  nt  are noncoding, which include  <dig>  nt  of intronic dna and  <dig>  nt  of intergenic dna; the remaining  <dig>  nt  are comprised of  <dig>  nt  coding for proteins and  <dig>  nt  coding for structural rnas. the intergenic regions range from  <dig> to > <dig>  nt in length, and, on average, are  <dig> nt long. the at content of the  <dig>  nt mtdna sequence is 66%. our annotation of the v. carteri mtdna includes  <dig> protein-coding genes; the full suite of rrna-coding modules required for the formation of the large-subunit and small-subunit rrnas;  <dig> trna-coding genes; and  <dig> introns,  <dig> of group-i affiliation, located in cox <dig> and cob, and  <dig> of group-ii affiliation, located in cob . both group-i introns contain an open reading frame  encoding a putative laglidadg endonuclease. the sole group-ii intron has an orf for which the deduced amino-acid sequence shows similarity to a reverse transcriptase . the doe jgi v. carteri mtdna sequences that we assembled  have, as mentioned above, an additional group-i intron in cox <dig> that is not present in v. carteri strain 72- <dig> . the coding suite that we acquired for the v. carteri mtdna is identical to that of the c. reinhardtii mitochondrial genome  <cit>  as is the gene order save for two rearrangements, which are outlined on figure  <dig>  there are two interesting features of the v. carteri mtdna relative to its c. reinhardtii counterpart. first, the v. carteri l <dig> rrna-coding module harbours a  <dig> nt insertion composed of short palindromic repeats, whereas that of c. reinhardtii contains no repeats . when the v. carteri l <dig> module is folded into a putative secondary-structure model within the context of the lsu rrna it contains two structural constituents: l8a and l8b , where the 3' end of l8a and the 5' end of l8b border the  <dig> nt insertion . at present, we do not know if this insertion is removed from the primary transcript so that separate l8a and l8b mature transcripts are produced or if a single mature l <dig> transcript is generated with the insertion. the second point of interest is that although a putative reverse transcriptase gene is found in the mtdna of both of v. carteri  and c. reinhardtii , that of v. carteri appears to be part of a group-ii intron located in cob, whereas in c. reinhardtii, rtl is a free standing gene that is lacking an intron but speculated to have originated from one  <cit>  – see popescu and lee  <cit>  for further discussion. the deduced amino-acid sequences of both orf <dig> and rtl have a conserved domain that resembles that of a reverse transcriptase with group-ii intron affiliation; however, the amino-acid sequence of orf <dig> also has a conserved domain with similarity to a type-ii intron maturase, while that of rtl does not. this extra domain encoded in orf <dig> also explains why this orf is twice the size of rtl .

in regard to the  <dig>  nt of v. carteri ptdna sequence data that were generated,  <dig>  nt  are noncoding, of which  <dig>  nt are intronic dna and  <dig>  nt are intergenic dna;  <dig>  nt  code for proteins and  <dig>  nt  code for structural rnas. the intergenic regions that were sequenced range from  <dig> nt to > <dig>  nt in length and have an average size of  <dig>  nt. the  <dig> kb of ptdna are 57% at. our annotation of the ptdna sequences includes  <dig> genes:  <dig> coding for standard plastid proteins,  <dig> coding for structural rnas , and  <dig> corresponding to orfs  that have been previously found in plastid genomes . three group-i introns were observed, located in chll, psaa, and atpa; those in the later two genes contain an orf encoding a putative laglidad endonuclease. five group-ii introns were discerned, situated in psaa, cema, psab, atpa, and atpb; the introns of the latter two genes have an orf for which the inferred amino-acid sequence resembles that of a reverse transcriptase. the group-ii intron of psaa is fragmented into two separate modules, which is also the case for c. reinhardtii . the  <dig> v. carteri ptdna genes presented here are all found in the c. reinhardtii plastid genome with the exception of orf <dig>  the only apparent homolog of orf <dig> is the ribosomal operon-associated gene  found in the euglena gracilis plastid genome. note, the c. reinhardtii ptdna encodes a further  <dig> trna-coding and one rrna-coding regions that we were unable to amplify from v. carteri.

a graph comparing both the estimated sizes and the fraction of noncoding nucleotides in the mitochondrial and plastid genomes of v. carteri relative to those of the currently available complete organelle-genome sequences from chlorophyte-, streptophyte- and other plastid-harbouring-taxa is shown in figure  <dig> . values of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively, were chosen, based on our sequence data, as minimum-estimate genome sizes for the v. carteri mtdna and ptdna.

short palindromic repeats in the mitochondrial and plastid genomes of v. carteri
scanning of the v. carteri mitochondrial- and plastid-dna sequences for repetitive elements lead to the identification of a series of short palindromic repeats in both of the organelle genomes; the consensus sequences, complementary bases, and copy numbers of the mtdna and ptdna palindromic elements are outlined in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. although the short palindromic repeats of the mtdna share many of the same structural traits as those of the ptdna , they differ by >50% in sequence identity and, therefore, must be considered as distinct repeats relative to those of the plastid genome.

the short palindromic repeats in the v. carteri mtdna are restricted to intergenic and intronic regions, with the exception of the palindromic elements in the l <dig> rrna-coding module. all of the intergenic regions that measure > <dig> nt in length consist predominantly of palindromic repeats; the few intergenic regions with lengths < <dig> nt are composed of non-repetitive dna. within the intronic regions, the palindromic repeats are confined to the non-orf portions of the group-i and group-ii introns. all four of the identified mitochondrial introns contain short palindromic repeats in their non-orf regions, including the optional group-i intron of cox <dig>  which was found in the mtdna of v. carteri strain hk <dig>  approximately  <dig>  nt  of the  <dig>  nt of noncoding mtdna that were sequenced are composed of short palindromic repeats. a dotplot similarity matrix of the v. carteri mtdna plotted against itself, shown in supplementary figure s <dig> , emphasizes the magnitude of repetitive dna in this genome and draws attention to the high degree of sequence identity between the different palindromic elements within and among the various intergenic and intronic regions.

the short palindromic repeat elements identified in the v. carteri mtdna show >50% sequence identity with one another and share similar structural and compositional traits . the individual palindromes range from 11– <dig> nt in length  and from 71–84% in their at content. when the palindromes are folded into hairpin structures, the stem component of the hairpin varies from 4– <dig> nt in length, and the loop portion is usually 3– <dig> nt long and frequently has the sequence 5'-taaa-3' or 5'-ttta-3' . in many instances, a short palindromic repeat is found inserted within another palindromic repeat, resulting in larger, more elaborate repetitive elements; these larger repeats have a maximum length of  <dig> nt, and, in a few cases, are found at multiple locations in the mitochondrial genome. for example, a  <dig> nt repeat sequence composed of complete and incomplete short palindromic units is found in the group-i introns of cob and cox <dig>  in the intergenic regions between cob and nad <dig>  and in the group-ii intron of cob. some of these more complex repeats can also be folded into trna-like structures – as shown in supplementary figure s <dig> .

like the mitochondrial genome, the noncoding regions of the v. carteri plastid genome abound with short palindromic sequences. these palindromic elements are observed in all of the sequenced intergenic regions that have lengths > <dig> nt and in the non-orf portions of the psaa and atpa group-i introns. no palindromic elements are located in the chll group-i intron or in any of the identified group-ii introns. overall, the short palindromic repeats constitute ~80%  of the  <dig>  noncoding nucleotides in the v. carteri ptdna. a dotplot similarity matrix of the v. carteri plastid genome plotted against itself  shows the high level of sequence identity among the various palindromic repeats.

in the v. carteri ptdna, most of the short palindromic repeats contain the sequence motif 5'-tcccctttaggga-3' . the palindromes have a size range of 14– <dig> nt, with an average length of  <dig> nt, and, when folded into hairpin structures, their stems and loops vary in length from 5– <dig> nt and 3– <dig> nt, respectively. in most cases, the loops of the hairpin structures contain the sequence 5'-taaa-3' or 5'-ttta-3' . the at content of the ptdna palindromes varies from 39–55%. as observed for the mtdna, the ptdna palindromic elements are often found inserted into one another, the consequence of which is a series of multifarious repetitive sequences.

the short palindromic repeats of the mitochondrial and plastid compartments have similar structural attributes: 1) they have proliferated in intergenic regions and non-orf segments of introns; 2) they have an average size of  <dig> nt and a maximum length of ~ <dig> nt; and 3) the loops of their hairpin structures are generally 3– <dig> nt long with the sequence 5'-ttta-3' or 5'-ttta-3'.

the nuclear genome of v. carteri shares sequence identity with organelle dna
to investigate if the short palindromic repeats in the mtdna and ptdna of v. carteri are present in the nucdna, we analyzed the draft nuclear genome sequence of v. carteri at the doe jgi  <cit> . manual curation of the v. carteri nuclear genome is still underway; therefore, only the first  <dig> scaffolds of the nuclear-genome assembly were analyzed. approximately 78% of the v. carteri nucdna is contained in these  <dig> scaffolds, their cumulative length is  <dig>  mb, and each scaffold is at least  <dig>  mb long. the amount of nucdna in these  <dig> scaffolds that map to mtdna and ptdna is described in table 1; the approximate number of nucdna-located organelle-like repeats is outlined in figures  <dig> and  <dig>

thirty-three kilobases of nucdna  share >90% identity with mtdna;  <dig>  kb  of this shared sequence are homologous to the short palindromic repeats in the intergenic and non-orf intronic regions of the mitochondrial genome; the remaining  <dig>  kb  map to the coding and intronic-orf portions of the mtdna . in the nucdna,  <dig> distinct regions show homology to mtdna; the average mapping length of these regions is  <dig> nt. of the  <dig> nuclear scaffolds that were analyzed, all but two  have at least one region that shows homology to mtdna.

seventy-three kilobases of the v. carteri nucdna  share >90% identity with ptdna;  <dig>  kb  of this shared sequence are homologous to the short palindromic repeats in the intergenic and non-orf-intronic portions of the ptdna, and  <dig>  kb  are homologous to the coding regions and intronic orfs of the plastid genome . in the nuclear genome,  <dig>  different regions show homology to ptdna, and the average similarity length is  <dig> nt. all of the  <dig> nuclear scaffolds that were examined have at least one region that shows homology to ptdna.

in total,  <dig>  kb  of the v. carteri nuclear-genome-sequence data that were analyzed share sequence identity to the short palindromic repeats of the organelle genomes. the secondary structure and general characteristics of the nuclear-palindromic repeat elements are the same as those described for the organelle palindromes in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

in order to place the v. carteri data described above in a broader context, we analyzed the c. reinhardtii nuclear genome for regions that show sequence identity to its mtdna and ptdna – these results are summarized in supplementary table s <dig> . only  <dig> % of the c. reinhardtii nuclear genome maps to organelle dna , which is 10-times less than what is observed for v. carteri .

discussion
expanded architectures and the proliferation of selfish dna in the organelle genomes of v. carteri
the v. carteri organelle genomes are profuse with noncoding dna. our analyses indicate that the mitochondrial genome is >61% noncoding, which is the most expanded chlorophyte-mtdna sequence currently deposited in genbank  <cit>  – other complete mitochondrial genome sequences from chlorophyte are larger only because they contain more genes. the plastid genome is the largest  and most bloated  ptdna sequence from any taxon observed to date . heretofore, the largest documented plastid genome was  <dig>  kb, belonging to the chlorophyte stigeoclonium helveticum  <cit> ; and the plastid genome with the highest fraction of noncoding dna was that of c. reinhardtii   <cit> . at present, due to a lack of available mtdna and ptdna sequence data, we do not know if other colonial or multicellular algae in the volvocine line of the chlorophyceae have bloated organelle genomes as a result of excessive noncoding dna. preliminary investigations of the volvox aureus mitochondrial genome indicate that it harbours palindromic repeats; these repeats do not share sequence similarity with those of the v. carteri mtdna  <cit> .

the fact that short palindromic repeats respectively constitute ~80% and ~75% of the mtdna and ptdna noncoding regions suggests that these elements precipitated the expansion of the organelle genomes. we must, therefore, ask: how did the palindromic repeats disseminate their sequence throughout the noncoding regions of the organelle dna? the processes by which this could have occurred include transposition, retrotransposition via an rna intermediate, and recombination-based mechanisms, such as gene conversion ; at present, we are not partial to any one of these mechanisms. it is worth noting, however, that both the mitochondrial and plastid genomes of v. carteri encode a putative reverse transcriptase and a putative endonuclease; the mutual association of these enzymes has been invoked for mediating the retrotransposition of selfish dna. koll et al.  <cit>  propose that the mobility of an ultra-short invasive element in the mtdna of the filamentous fungus podospora anserina is instigated by a group-ii-intron-encoded reverse transcriptase; they also suggest that an intron-encoded endonuclease generates the 3'-hydroxyl required for reverse transcription. of all the intronic orfs deposited in genbank, the deduced amino-acid sequence of orf <dig> in the volvox mtdna shows the greatest identity  to that of the cox1-intronic orf of p. anserina. another intriguing observation is that the short palindromic repeats in the v. carteri organelle and nuclear genomes are found in both orientations on the same strand, i.e., the same sequence can occur in the 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' directions – this is suggestive of a transposition-mediated mechanism of mobility rather than one based on recombination.

short palindromic repeats in the three genetic compartments of v. carteri
short palindromic repeats are found in the three genetic compartments of v. carteri. the palindromic elements of the mtdna are structurally similar but different in nucleotide sequence to those of the ptdna, whereas the nucdna palindromes are of two types: those that map to the mtdna and those that map to ptdna. these observations evoke several questions, such as are the palindromic repeats in the mtdna and ptdna related? and if so, in what genetic compartment did they first appear? moreover, how did the nucdna acquire palindromes that share sequence identity to those of the mitochondrial and plastid genomes, and why are they not as abundant as those of the organelle dna? and finally, are the palindromic elements indigenous to v. carteri or are they the products of lateral gene transfer?

although the mtdna palindromic repeats differ in nucleotide sequence to the palindromes of the ptdna, these two groups of repeats share enough structural features to suggest that they have descended from a common repetitive element and, thus, represent a single class of selfish dna. for instance, in both the mitochondrial and plastid compartments the palindromic repeats reside in identical genomic landscapes  and they also inhabit these noncoding regions in similar abundances, representing ~80% of the noncoding nucleotides in both the mitochondrial and plastid genomes. moreover, the mtdna and ptdna palindromes fold into hairpin structures where the loop portion is consistently 5'-taaa-3' or 5'-attt-3'.

the same palindromic elements that have propagated in the v. carteri organelle dna are also found in a small fraction  of the nucdna. although these nuclear-palindromic repeats can share up to 100% sequence identity with those of the mtdna or ptdna, many are degenerate with mismatches in the stem component of their hairpin structures. this observation, coupled with the relatively low abundance of these repeats in the nuclear genome, leads us to suggest that the nucdna palindromes are inert, accumulating in the nucdna through both mitochondrial-to-nucleus and plastid-to-nucleus dna-transfer events – the movement of organelle dna to nuclear genomes is well documented  <cit> . further evidence to support this hypothesis is the fact that the proposed organelle-derived palindromes are present within the nuclear genome in the same proportions as other genetic regions from the mitochondrial and plastid genomes, such as coding regions .

two observations regarding the derivation of the short palindromic repeats in v. carteri are worth noting. first, the palindromic elements appear to have a strong affinity for the non-orf regions of organelle introns, especially those in the mitochondrial genome. because organelle introns are, themselves, a type of selfish element, which can migrate between organelle compartments, both within a species and between unrelated species , it is not unreasonable to surmise that the origin of the short palindromic repeats in v. carteri is linked to lateral intron transfer. the second observation is that the short palindromic repeats have propagated in only two of the nine introns in the v. carteri plastid genome: the group-i introns of psaa and atpa. why have the other seven plastid introns  remained inviolate from palindromic elements? the two group-i plastid introns that contain short palindromic repeats belong to subgroup ib. considering that the other group-i intron in the ptdna , which is devoid of palindromes, is also of subgroup ib, it seems unlikely that the palindromic elements are favouring a certain class of intron. it is noteworthy that the chll group-i intron lacks a laglidadg homing endonuclease, whereas the group-i introns of psaa and atpa, as well as those of the mtdna, harbour laglidadg orfs – perhaps, as suggested above, the mobility of the palindromic elements is dependent on intronic endonuclease proteins. another possibility is that the plastid genome was seeded with short palindromic repeats after the inception of palindromic elements in the mtdna and, therefore, the plastid palindromic repeats have not had sufficient time to spread to all of the intronic regions in the ptdna; moreover, some of ptdna introns may have arrived more recently in evolutionary time than those of psaa and atpa, and, thus, have not yet been seeded with repeats.

short palindromic repeats and the evolution of fragmented ribosomal-rna-coding modules
when aono et al.  <cit>  first identified short palindromic repeats in the v. carteri mitochondrial genome they predicted that these repeats would be associated with the fragmentation of rrna-transcripts. the mtdna data presented here may support these predications. our annotation of the v. carteri mitochondrial genome contains eight modules encoding the lsu rrna, and their arrangement within the mtdna is identical to that of c. reinhardtii, with the exception that the l <dig> module of v. carteri contains a large block of palindromic repeats, whereas that of c. reinhardtii harbours no repetitive mtdna. at the present time we do not know if this insertion represents a fragmentation point within the l <dig> coding module that is removed from the primary transcript or if it is maintained as a variable region within an intact l <dig> transcript. we favour the former possibility because in the latter scenario the insertion is three-fold larger than any previously reported variable region identified in ribosomal rna – based on the comparative rna website  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the goal of this study was to investigate the genomic breadth and the evolutionary implications of short palindromic repeats in the organelle and nuclear genomes of v. carteri. our findings indicate that selfish dna, in the form of palindromic elements, have proliferated in the v. carteri mtdna and ptdna; and although copies of this element exist in the nuclear compartment, we suggest that they are inert and arrived in the nuclear genome via rare organelle-to-nucleus dna transfer events. we speculate that the palindromic repeats in v. carteri descended from a single invasive element, perhaps first seeded in v. carteri through the lateral gene transfer of a mitochondrial intron, eventually spreading to the ptdna through mitochondrial-to-plastid dna migration. overall, the palindromic repeats appear to be involved with the expansion of the v. carteri organelle dna and have potentially precipitated a gene fragmentation event in the mitochondrial genome.
