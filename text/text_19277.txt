BACKGROUND
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a gram-negative bacterium belonging to the family pasteurellaceae. it is the etiological agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious respiratory infection that causes severe economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. the disease, transmitted by the aerosol route or direct contact with an infected pig, is characterized by hemorrhagic, fibrinous and necrotic lung lesions  <cit> . the clinical picture may range from peracute to chronic and asymptomatic carrier pigs can transmit the disease when introduced into uninfected herds. two different biovars are recognised within the species: biovar  <dig> strains are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  dependent while biovar  <dig> strains are nad-independent  <cit> . based on capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharide  o-chain components,  <dig> serovars have been described. serovars  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> usually belong to biovar 1; whereas serovars  <dig> and  <dig> isolates are typically biovar  <dig>  <cit> , however, biovar  <dig> variants of serovar  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been reported  <cit> .

serotyping and other genetic typing methods for a. pleuropneumoniae have contributed greatly to surveillance and epidemiological studies. these tools provide important information for decision making in control programs aimed at eradication of virulent types of the bacterium. nevertheless, serological cross-reactivity between a. pleuropneumoniae serovars  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , between serovars  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , and between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  has been described. in north america, serovars  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are reported to be the most prevalent, while serovars  <dig> and  <dig> are most commonly isolated in europe, and serovar  <dig> is the predominant isolate from australian pigs  <cit> .

the virulence factors described for a. pleuropneumoniae include lps, capsular polysaccharides, apx toxins , outer membrane proteins  and various iron acquisition systems. however, the overall contribution of each component to the infection process remains unclear, as do the mechanisms of pathogenesis of this organism  <cit> . all serovars are capable of causing disease; however, some serovars such as serovars  <dig>   <dig>  5a, 5b,  <dig> and  <dig> are more frequently involved in severe outbreaks with high mortality and pulmonary lesions. several reports have suggested that the differences in virulence among the serovars can mainly be attributed to different combinations of apx toxins and the amount of capsular polysaccharides  <cit> . almost all of the currently available vaccines against a. pleuropneumoniae are either inactivated whole-cell bacterins or subunit combinations of apx toxins and proteins or omps  <cit> . experimental challenge and field usage data indicate that these vaccines neither induce cross-serovar immunity nor prevent development of the carrier state and have little impact on morbidity  <cit> .

molecular techniques, including multilocus enzyme electrophoresis   <cit> , pulsed-field gel electrophoresis   <cit>  and amplified fragment length polymorphism  analysis  <cit>  have been used to study different strains of a. pleuropneumoniae. these investigations have shown that genetic diversity among isolates of the same serovar may be almost equivalent to that in the species as a whole, suggesting that a. pleuropneumoniae strains are genetically very similar and would seem to have a clonal population structure. however, restriction analysis fingerprinting  <cit>  studies revealed that with the exception of serovars  <dig> and  <dig>  the reference strains of a. pleuropneumoniae are clearly different. similarly, work of chevallier et al. and møller et al. revealed a more pronounced heterogeneity in the chromosomal structure among strains of serovars  <dig>  5a, 5b,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the notion of heterogeneity amongst serovars is also supported by early free-solution dna-dna hybridization studies that showed that representative strains of  <dig> serovars of a. pleuropneumoniae shared  <dig> to 90% sequence homology with a. pleuropneumoniae serovar  <dig>  <cit> .

we are using a reverse vaccinology approach to identify new candidates for the development of cross-protective vaccines against a. pleuropneumoniae. using the complete and annotated a. pleuropneumoniae l <dig> genome  <cit> , chung and coworkers published a list of  <dig> predicted omps or lipoproteins of a. pleuropneumoniae obtained by using five genome scanning programs  <cit> . the availability of the genome sequence of a. pleuropneumoniae also enables us to study diversity of a. pleuropneumoniae on a genome-wide scale. to date, two additional complete genomic sequences have become available, a. pleuropneumoniae serovar  <dig> jl <dig>   <cit> , and a. pleuropneumoniae serovar  <dig> ap <dig> .

m-cgh is a powerful tool to estimate whole genomic diversity and to study the gene content and locate genomic islands in closely related strains of bacteria  <cit> . in the present study, this method was applied for the first time to study genetic relationships among reference strains of the  <dig> serovars of a. pleuropneumoniae and representative field isolates. our goal was to identify conserved genes with particular emphasis on those predicted to encode outer membrane proteins and lipoproteins because of their potential for the development of improved vaccines.

RESULTS
the first microarray-based study of a. pleupneumoniae, which used a full-genome microarray based upon a draft version of the genome sequence of strain l <dig>  evaluated the effects of iron limitation  <cit> . from the recently completed genome sequence of a. pleuropneumoniae l <dig>  <cit> , a full genome a. pleuropneumoniae microarray , which takes into account corrections from the draft sequence and comprises reporters matching the sequence of more than  <dig> genes, was developed and used in this study. with microarray hybridization, the presence of a specific gene in a test strain is based on comparison of the intensity of the hybridization signal obtained with the genomic dna of the tester strain to that obtained with the genomic dna of the control strain for the corresponding reporter. the ratio of intensity of tester signal to control signal is usually expressed on a log <dig> scale and we used a threshold of - <dig> to define genes likely to be divergent in sequence from the strain l <dig> genome. we have shown previously that genes absent from the tested strain usually have log <dig> ratio values less than - <dig>  <cit> . the overall genomic variability of the  <dig> a. pleuropneumoniae serovars is shown in figure  <dig> where the number of serovars in which a gene is variable is plotted for each gene with the gene order corresponding to the strain l <dig> genome sequence. although most genes are conserved across the  <dig> serovars, we observed a number of distinct clusters of absent/divergent genes. a total of  <dig> genes were identified as either divergent or highly divergent/absent in the  <dig> reference strains tested . in the largest cluster , many genes are annotated as potential phage or prophage genes, suggesting that this cluster might correspond to a phage. a smaller cluster around apl_ <dig> to apl_ <dig> corresponds to genes annotated as transposon-related. several of the other clusters correspond to genes annotated as components of dna restriction and modification systems. clusters of variable genes involved in toxin production, and in capsule and lps biosythesis were observed as expected. several other clusters containing unannotated genes may warrant further investigation. experiments with closely related bacterium actinobacillus suis showed only weak hybridization to the appchip <dig> microarray, suggesting that the nucleotide sequence identities for the orfs are low; consistent with earlier dna-dna hybridization studies  <cit>  .

we used hierarchical clustering based on the m-cgh results to examine the relationship between a. pleuropneumoniae serovars based on genomic content. the dendrogram of the data excluding phage and transposon-related genes is shown in figure  <dig>  this tree has very similar structure to the tree based on data from all  <dig> genes on appchip <dig> , and both show serovars 5a and 5b forming a distinct subclade. also, the antigenically related serovars  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cluster together as do cross-reactive serovars  <dig> and  <dig>  nevertheless we do not observe clustering of serovars  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which are the most common ones found in north america or of serovars  <dig> and  <dig> which represent biovar  <dig> 

the m-cgh patterns for capsule biosynthesis genes  show a high degree of variability for the various serovars compared to serovar 5b. this is to be expected as the capsule is a major determinant of the a. pleuropneumoniae serovar  <cit> . much less variation across serovars is observed with the cpx genes which are involved in capsule export than with the cps and kds genes which are involved in capsule biosynthesis.

serotyping of a. pleuropneumoniae is based mainly on the capsular polysaccharide  and the lipopolysaccharide antigenic o-chain component  <cit> . the m-cgh patterns for capsule biosynthesis genes  show a high degree of variability for the various serovars compared to serovar 5b, except for serovar 5a. the structures of cps from subtypes 5a and 5b have been determined  <cit> . both structures share a common backbone consisting of disaccharide repeating units, [→6)-α-d-glcpnac-β-kdop- they were therefore not included on the appchip <dig> microarray.

the genomic variability of  <dig> representative field isolates of a. pleuropneumoniae serovars  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  for each serovar, the number of strains in which a gene is variable is plotted for each gene with the gene order corresponding to the strain l <dig> genome sequence. for serovars 5a, we observed only one cluster of highly variable genes which is the largest cluster  containing many genes annotated as potential phage or prophage genes in serovar 5b.

to evaluate relationships among the  <dig> field isolates of serovars  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and their respective reference strains, we performed hierarchical clustering to build dendrograms based upon analysis of the data excluding phage and transposase genes . except for serovar  <dig>  strains from the same serovar formed a cluster. the analysis indicated that the ontario serovar  <dig> field isolates  <dig> and  <dig> clustered separately from the quebec and saskatchewan serovar  <dig> strains. in contrast, ontario and saskatchewan serovar  <dig> field isolates were genetically very similar. as expected, the eight serovar 5a and 5b strains form a distinct cluster. these results are consistent with earlier restriction endonuclease fingerprinting analysis, which revealed limited heterogeneity amongst isolates of serovar  <dig> or serovar  <dig> whereas serovar  <dig> isolates showed greater variation  <cit> .

in canada, the most prevalent serovars are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, other serovars have also been isolated from sporadic outbreaks of pleuropneumonia. this is the first report describing the isolation and characterization of serovar  <dig> strains from field cases of porcine pleuropneumonia in north america. in previous reports, serovar  <dig> strains have only been isolated from pigs in australia and japan  <cit> . hierarchical clustering based on our m-cgh results showed that the three serovar  <dig> field strains  are closely related to the reference strain of serovar  <dig> of a. pleuropneumoniae. these three serovar  <dig> field strains also had the same m-cgh pattern of toxin biosynthesis genes as reported for serovar  <dig> field strain isolated in japan  <cit>  and the reference strain . in these strains the apx structural genes, apxiia, apxiib and apxiva, but not apxia and apxic, and apx secretion genes apxibd were detected .

the serologically non-typeable isolate, 05– <dig>  possessed the same m-cgh pattern of toxin biosynthesis genes as the reference strains of serovars 5a and 5b. the m-cgh pattern for capsule biosynthesis genes of the 05– <dig> isolate showed little variability compared to serovar 5b. only two genes involved in capsule biosynthesis, cpsc and cpsd had a log <dig> ratio value less than - <dig>  these two genes may be deleted or diverged in sequence in this isolate, which could explain why it was not typable by serology. nevertheless, the dendrogram showed that 05– <dig> isolate is closely related to the serovar  <dig> , suggesting that it can be classified in serovar  <dig> strains.

other clustering methods or distances were applied to the data set in order to verify that the clusters we identified were robust . hierarchical clustering with manhattan distance metrics and k-medians clustering   <cit>  yielded highly similar results: strains from the same serovar clustered together, with the serovar  <dig> strains from ontario grouped with serovar  <dig> strains, although the serotype  <dig>  <dig> strain was left on its own following k-medians clustering. in both cases, the non-typeable 05– <dig> isolate clustered with serovar  <dig> strains. cluster affinity search technique  <cit>  generated the same results, however serovar  <dig> strains were scattered in three different clusters, and were not grouped with serovar  <dig> strains from ontario.

commercially available vaccines against a. pleuropneumoniae, including inactivated whole-cell bacterins and subunit vaccines, have limited efficacy and little impact on morbidity. moreover, these vaccines confer only partial protection against the homologous serovar and generally do not confer protection against challenge with heterologous serovars  <cit> . a major focus of research for the development of new vaccines against porcine pleuropneumonia has been to identify proteins that are conserved in all  <dig> serovars of a. pleuropneumoniae and that generate cross-protection against strains of all serovars. based on the principle that surface-exposed antigens are more susceptible to recognition by antibodies and therefore are the most suitable candidates for a vaccine, the full genome of a. pleuropneumoniae l <dig> was screened using bioinformatics predictor programs to identify open reading frames encoding putative proteins localized at the bacterial outer membrane and  <dig> omps and  <dig> lipoproteins were predicted  <cit> . using m-cgh to identify genes that are highly conserved among the reference strains of the  <dig> serovars of a. pleuropneumoniae, as well as among field isolates, we identified  <dig> potential vaccine targets   that are conserved among all serovars and biovars. among these candidates, four have been shown to be expressed in vivo. using selective capture of transcribed sequences analysis   <cit> , it has been shown that ompa  and apl_ <dig> are expressed by a. pleuropneumoniae in necrotic pig lung tissue. furthermore, polyamine transport protein d , omp p <dig> , ompa  and outer membrane antigenic lipoprotein b  are required for efficient colonization of the porcine host by a. pleuropneumoniae as shown by signature-tagged mutagenesis  experiments  <cit> .

a. pleuropneumoniae bind preferentially to cells of the lower respiratory tract, where some essential nutrients for the growth of bacteria, such as iron, are limited. a. pleuropneumoniae has developed several iron uptake systems including the hydroxamate siderophore receptor fhua , a hemoglobin-binding receptor hgba  and a transferrin receptor complex composed of two outer membrane proteins, transferrin-binding protein a  and transferring-binding protein b . not only is iron essential for growth of bacteria but iron-restriction is an important signal that controls expression of many genes including some coding for virulence factors  <cit> . hence, these proteins involved in iron uptake are considered as candidates for development of subunit vaccines. however, our m-cgh results showed that only one protein involved in iron uptake, tbpa, is conserved among the  <dig> serovars of a. pleuropneumoniae. this observation could explain the partial protection against infection with heterologous strains conferred by an acellular pentavalent subunit vaccine containing the tbpb of a. pleuropneumoniae serovar  <dig>  <cit> .

the nadph-sulfite reductase hemoprotein cysi  of a. pleuropneumoniae, a cytoplasmic protein involved in cellular metabolism, has also been shown to induce protective immunity against a homologous challenge  <cit> . our cgh analysis showed that cysi is conserved among all strains tested in this study, thus this protein could represent an interesting vaccine target.

two genes , encoding homologs of outer membrane protein a , were identified as potential vaccine targets in this study. apl_ <dig> and apl_ <dig> have  <dig> % identity and showed  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity, respectively, to ompa from the bovine pathogen mannheimia haemolytica, which has surface exposed epitopes and is recognized by convalescent bovine sera  <cit> . in addition to ompa , the outer-membrane lipoprotein lolb , is expressed in vivo by a. pleuropneumoniae and they have been identified and characterized as potential components of a cross-protective sub-unit vaccine against a. pleuropneumoniae  <cit> . however, oldfield et al. reported that neither of these proteins was capable of eliciting protective immunity against a. pleuropneumoniae challenge  <cit> . the outer membrane protein pala  was also on our list of conserved proteins. nevertheless, it has been shown that vaccination with pala increases the severity of a. pleuropneumoniae infection in vaccinated pigs  <cit> . thus, the deleterious effect of pala in vaccination and the inability of lolb and ompa to induce protective immunity eliminate these proteins from the list of potential vaccine candidates.

interestingly, homologs of some of the remaining conserved vaccine candidates are already under investigation as vaccine components in other bacteria . for example, the lipoprotein plp <dig> from m. haemolytica, which had  <dig> % identity with lipoprotein plpd , was identified by screening antigens of m. haemolytica with sera from presponse™ vaccinated calves  that were protected from m. haemolytica a <dig> infections  <cit> , thus suggesting plpd may be a protective antigen. another candidate, apl_ <dig>  a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase , showed 82% and  <dig> % identity to glpq of pasteurella multocida and protein d of haemophilus influenzae, respectively. the role of glpq in a. pleuropneumoniae and p. multocida is unknown, however, its homolog in h. influenzae has been shown to mediate the acquisition of choline directly from the membranes of epithelial cells in culture and incorporate it into its own lps  <cit> . h. influenzae protein d has been showed to elicit cross-protection against virulent heterologous strains of h. influenzae in rats  <cit> . in contrast to h. influenzae, glpq in p. multocida is not surface-exposed and is unable to stimulate protective immunity, even though vaccinated animals have high antibody titers  <cit> . therefore, the location of glpq and accessibility of glpq-specific antibodies should be determined in a. pleuropneumoniae.

omp p <dig>  is another attractive surface exposed antigen  <cit>  showing 65% identity to lipoprotein e  in h. influenzae, which is highly conserved among both typeable and nontypeable strains  <cit> . in nontypeable strains of h. influenzae , omp p <dig> is essential for utilization of nad and subsequent growth  <cit> . intranasal immunization of mice with omp p <dig> in a mucosal adjuvant induces protective immune responses against nthi infections and notably, a mucosal immune response, which reduces nthi nasopharynx colonization  <cit> . these observations in h. influenzae suggest that lipoprotein e  may be an attractive candidate for a vaccine against a. pleuropneumoniae.

pcp  of h. influenzae is under investigation since it is surface-exposed and anti-pcp serum shows bactericidal activity against several clinical isolates of type b and non-typeable h. influenzae  <cit> . outer membrane lipoprotein slyb  shows highest identity  to this protein. however, although pcp from p. multocida  is recognized by convalescent chicken antiserum, it is unable to stimulate protective immunity  <cit> .

the polyamine transport protein d, potd , has extensive homology to a  <dig> kda lipoprotein, lpp <dig> of m. haemolytica. lpp <dig> is surface-exposed and is recognized by sera from calves resistant to infection after natural exposure to m. haemolytica and by sera from calves vaccinated with m. haemolytica a <dig> outer membranes or with live bacteria  <cit> . recently, in the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae, potd has been reported to be involved in virulence in both an animal model of sepsis and pneumonia  <cit> . active immunization of mice with recombinant potd induces a vigorous antibody response and provides a significant degree of protection against lethal pneumococcal infection  <cit> . these data suggest that potd plays a role in the development of immunity to bacterial infections and may be a protective antigen.

homologs of the outer membrane protein d <dig>  have been reported in several pathogenic bacteria including h. influenzae, haemophilus ducreyi, p. multocida, neisseria meningitidis and shigella dysenteriae  <cit> . these studies suggest a role for these proteins in pathogenesis and immunity. notably, it has been shown that d <dig> confers protection against homologous and heterologous strains of h. influenzae in animal models  <cit> . similarly, oma <dig>  a closely related homolog in p. multocida, has been shown to elicit protection in animal model of infection  <cit> . thus d <dig> is potentially an attractive vaccine target.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have shown that m-cgh can be a useful tool to identify candidates for reverse vaccinology in order to develop subunit vaccines to a. pleuropneumoniae. after comparing cgh data for  <dig> reference strains and  <dig> fresh field isolates, we have identified  <dig> conserved genes that are predicted to code for outer membrane proteins or lipoproteins. this could assist in development of vaccines with efficacy across serovar boundaries. future investigations will include the use of microarray transcript profiling experiments of a. pleuropneumoniae isolated from infected pigs to identify potential vaccine candidates that are both conserved and expressed in vivo during infection in pigs.
