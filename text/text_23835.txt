BACKGROUND
in animal cells, the cytoskeleton is composed of three filament classes: actin microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments  so denoted for their size  <cit> . the integrated network formed by all these filaments, in conjunction with associated proteins, is responsible for the mechanical integrity of the cell. in contrast to the evolutionarily conserved actin and tubulin proteins, ifs are highly divergent and exhibit cell typespecific expression patterns . in human, up to  <dig> different ifs have been identified and grouped in five subfamilies, termed type i to v, with type i and type ii including keratins  <cit> .

keratins are the major structural proteins in epithelial cells, and are encoded by a large multigene family that accounts for about 75% of all if genes in chordates  <cit> . they act as a scaffold allowing for the maintenance of cellular architecture, and providing resistance to mechanical and non-mechanical stresses; although, other nonstructural functions such as cell signalling, protein targeting in polarized epithelia, cell proliferation, and in apoptosis have also been reported  <cit> . according to the biochemical properties of the encoded polypeptides, keratins are classified into two different types: type i and type ii  <cit> . type i keratins are acidic , and their molecular masses range from  <dig> to  <dig> kda, whereas type ii keratins are neutral to basic  and tend to be larger . nevertheless, this designation of type i keratins as acidic or type ii as basic is not supported in fish . unlike other if proteins, keratins form obligatory heteropolymeric filaments consisting of equal numbers of type i and type ii keratins  <cit> . all keratins share a common tripartite structure that includes a central highly α-helical "rod" domain, which features heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues, flanked by a "head" and a "tail" domain  <cit> . the heptad repeat pattern of the rod domain is a signature of a coiled-coil fold  <cit> , which leads to an elongated architecture formed by a parallel coiled-coil dimer. nevertheless, the heptad periodicity within the rod domain is interrupted in several places, resulting in four consecutive segments  of different size but identical number of amino acids  among keratins , separated by three spacers or "linkers"  of highly variable length and primary structure  <cit> .

according to their expression in epidermal keratinocytes as well as other stratified epithelia and simple epithelia, keratins are subdivided into two distinct types: "e"  and "s"   <cit> . in teleosts, "s" keratins are also expressed in many mesenchymal cells, probably helping to resist osmotic stress  <cit> . in human, the classical "s" keratin  <dig> and keratin  <dig>  <cit>  have true orthologs in tetrapods and teleosts. in contrast, teleost "e" keratins as well as other "s" keratins lack direct orthologs in other vertebrate classes, suggesting an independent evolution in bony fish  <cit> . this observation is also supported by sequence comparison and chromosomal distribution analyses of vertebrate keratin genes, which uncover a scattered distribution and an excess of type i keratins in teleosts in contrast to the two clusters and almost the same proportion of type i and type ii keratin genes found in mammalian genomes  <cit> .

senegalese sole, solea senegalensis , is a commercially important flatfish. during larval development, this species undergoes metamorphosis from  <dig> to  <dig> days after hatching . the process involves jaw and head restructuring, eye migration from the left to the right side, and a change from a symmetrical to an asymmetrical body shape  <cit> . these drastic morphological changes have been shown to be regulated by thyroid hormones  in flatfish  <cit> . currently, the regulation of keratin genes by ths has been demonstrated in other metamorphosing organisms such as xenopus laevis and rana catesbeiana  <cit> . in flatfish, only in atlantic halibut  a keratin gene  has been recently characterized. this gene was shown to be down-regulated at the climax of metamorphosis, when t <dig> hormone reached the highest levels  <cit> . nevertheless, it should be highlighted that dependence of keratin genes expression on ths during metamorphosis remains to be demonstrated in flatfish.

the development of large-scale genomics of senegalese sole has allowed for the availability of a high number of est sequences. in this study, we have identified and characterized two type i keratin genes . the main sequence features are described. phylogenetic analyses were carried out to identify putative orthologous sequences. gene expression profiles during larval development and in tissues from juvenile soles were explored using real-time pcr. additionally, thiourea  and t <dig> treatments were carried out in order to elucidate the dependence of both sseker gene expressions on ths.

RESULTS
molecular characterization and phylogeny of senegalese sole keratins
two sseker genes were identified after est analysis of a normalized cdna library constructed from different larval stages , undifferentiated gonads, and six adult tissues . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> clones were identified as sseker <dig> and sseker <dig>  respectively. sequences of both sseker loci were confirmed by direct sequencing of pcr products amplified from a pre-metamorphic library using all the possible combinations of keratin-specific primers  with universal primers t <dig> and t <dig> . the pcr conditions were the same as used in real-time assays. this strategy also allowed us to rule out amplification of additional senegalese sole keratin genes.

sseker <dig> encoded a transcript of  <dig> nucleotides   that contained a short 5'-untranslated region  followed by an open reading frame  of  <dig> codons. the 3'-untranslated region was  <dig> nt long and included a canonical polyadenylation signal  and a short oligo-a tail. for sseker <dig>  a cdna sequence of  <dig> nt was identified . the orf comprised  <dig> codons, and it was preceded by a 14-nt 5'-untranslated region. the 73-nt long 3'-untranslated region contained a polyadenylation signal  at positions 1276– <dig>  and as sseker <dig>  included a short oligo-a tail.

the translated aa sequences of sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> showed that they consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> residues of molecular mass  <dig>  and  <dig>  da, respectively. the predicted pi of sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> proteins was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

a computational analysis of sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> using tblastx revealed that the best matches corresponded to teleost type i keratins in both cases. both sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> contained a head domain  rich in glycine and serine, and a short tail domain . features of ifs present in both sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> included a central rod domain with the coil 1a , coil 1b , coil 2a , and coil 2b , separated by the linker regions l <dig> , l <dig>  and l <dig> , and the evolutionarily conserved if signature motif iaeyrrlld . in addition, five characteristic motifs of type i keratins were identified both in sseker <dig> and sseker <dig>  two in each of coil 1b and 2b, and a fifth one spanning between l <dig> and coil 2a . finally, a leucine-zipper motif l-x-l-x-l-x-l was identified in coil 1b domain of both sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> at positions 193– <dig> and 176– <dig>  respectively .

sequence identities between sseker <dig> and sseker <dig>  and with respect to type i keratins from other vertebrates , are depicted in table  <dig>  identity between both senegalese sole keratins was  <dig>   and  <dig> % , respectively. with respect to other species, sseker <dig> overall identities ranged between  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> % for the entire protein and central rod domain, respectively. for sseker <dig>  amino acid identities varied between  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> %, respectively. in all pairwise comparisons, sseker <dig> and hhker <dig> exhibited the highest identity values.

maximum likelihood  and neighbor-joining  phylogenetic trees were constructed from a multiple aa sequence alignment of the central rod domains corresponding to sseker <dig>  sseker <dig>  as well as a range of type i keratins . largely congruent topological trees were generated using both methods . in agreement with previous reports, keratin  <dig> sequences only found in ancient ray-finned fish such as sturgeon , bichir  and gar , appeared forming a separate and highly consistent clade  close to sequences of river lamprey  used as an outgroup  <cit> . similarly, a consistent clustering of gnathostomian keratin  <dig> sequences was also observed both in ml and nj trees. with regard to senegalese sole keratins, they grouped together with other teleost epidermal keratins in a highly consistent clade . nevertheless, sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> clustered into different subclades. the former appeared closely related to hhker <dig> in a highly supported branch . in contrast, sseker <dig> appeared as a single ramification of another cluster that also included either cauk <dig> and several zebrafish  keratins , or only a reduced group of zebrafish keratins . it is important to highlight that a teleost sseker <dig> counterpart was not found neither in ml nor in nj trees.

expression levels of sseker genes in tissues
steady-state levels of both senegalese sole keratin transcripts were quantitated in head-kidney, liver, testis, brain, heart, skin, skeletal muscle, spleen, intestine, stomach, and gills from juvenile soles . relative gene expression levels were normalized by measuring 18s rrna and expressed relative to head-kidney. both keratin genes exhibited a quite similar expression profile in tissues. sseker <dig> transcripts were highly abundant in skin . likewise, sseker <dig> was abundantly expressed in skin. however, this keratin gene also exhibited significantly higher mrna levels in gills than in the remaining tissues .

expression levels and regulation during larval development
expression patterns of both senegalese sole keratin genes during larval development  were also determined. data were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  <cit> , and further expressed relative to  <dig> dah. both sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> transcripts were detected very early at  <dig> dah . nevertheless, they displayed different expression profiles during development. sseker <dig> transcripts increased continuously reaching a peak at  <dig> dah . thereafter, mrna levels dropped progressively. in contrast, sseker <dig> transcripts increased significantly at  <dig> dah, coinciding with the external feeding . after that, expression levels did not vary significantly until the end of the metamorphic process, when a significant drop  was detected .

to investigate the involvement of ths on the expression of both keratin genes,  <dig> dah larvae were exposed to the goitrogen tu. as a consequence of the tu treatment, the metamorphic process was blocked at s1–s <dig> stages  as determined by the degree of eye migration  <cit> . no difference in survivability was observed with respect to untreated control . mrna levels for both sseker genes were quantified in whole larvae pools collected  <dig> h, and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after treatment . control larvae exhibited expression profiles similar to those described above . tu-treated larvae showed  <dig> and 5-fold higher sseker <dig> mrna levels  than controls at both  <dig> and  <dig> dat, respectively. in contrast, no significant differences in gene expression were found at  <dig> dat , suggesting that the rise of sseker <dig> transcripts during metamorphosis  is independent on ths. with regard to sseker <dig>  highly significant transcript levels were detected as a consequence of the tu treatment in larvae collected at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  dat when compared to respective controls. at the sight of these results, we carried out a rescue assay in order to determine the ability of t <dig> to revert the tu effect on the expression of both keratin genes. for this purpose,  <dig> dah larvae were exposed to tu to ensure the lack of endogenously synthethized t <dig> at day  <dig>  when the exogenous t <dig> was supplied. mrna levels of both sseker genes were determined in larvae sampled  <dig> and  <dig> days after t <dig> treatment . it is important to indicate that t <dig> released the metamorphosis blocking induced by tu. the expression patterns of untreated and tu-treated larvae were similar to those described above . in contrast, sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> steady-state transcript levels in tu+t4-treated larvae were similar or even significantly lower than those of untreated control .

discussion
we have obtained the complete cdna sequence of two distinct senegalese sole keratin genes, referred to as sseker <dig> and sseker <dig>  amino acid sequence analyses revealed that the subdomain organization was basically identical to that of mammalian and fish keratins in the central rod domain, detecting the four consecutive coils 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b  <cit> . moreover, both sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> presented the if signature motif at the end of coil 2b, a feature that is common to all ifs, and possessed a predicted molecular mass and pi within the expected value for vertebrate type i keratins  <cit> . a leucine-zipper motif conserved among type i keratins from zebrafish, goldfish , rainbow trout , x. laevis, and human was also identified at the end of coil 1b in both keratins  <cit> . all these results, and the identification of the five characteristic motifs that provide a signature for type i keratins, indicate that both sseker genes actually encode for functional type i keratins.

phylogenetic analyses give further support to the classification of sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> as "e" type i keratins. in fact, expression analysis of sseker genes in tissues showed that the highest transcript levels were observed in skin. both proteins were grouped together with other "e" type i keratins from teleosts  <cit>  in highly consistent clades both in ml and nj trees. at the sight of the phylogenetic trees, such a group of keratins does not seem to have a tetrapod counterpart. this result is not surprising if we take into account previous results showing that type i keratins from teleosts have diversified independently from those of tetrapods  <cit> .

with the exception of keratin  <dig> gene, next to the type ii keratin  <dig> gene, teleost type i genes are spread over many different positions in the genome. this may be the result of whole genome duplication and subsequent massive gene loss occurred in teleost fish lineage after its divergence from terrestrial vertebrates  <cit> . the high sequence identity and the close phylogenetic relatedness between sseker <dig> and hhker <dig> indicate that both genes could be considered as orthologous genes. however, this hypothesis is not supported by gene expression data. whereas hhker <dig> has an abundant expression in pre-metamorphic larvae  <cit> , sseker <dig> reaches the highest expression levels during metamorphosis . in addition, hhker <dig> is undetectable in adult skin  <cit> ; in contrast, sseker <dig> is abundantly expressed in skin from juvenile soles. so, if hhker <dig> and sseker <dig> are real  orthologous genes, it is still a problem that is unresolved. with regard to sseker <dig>  no evident counterparts were found both in ml and nj phylogenetic trees either in tetrapods or in teleosts, and thus sseker <dig> can be considered as a novel type i keratin. sseker <dig> could be the result of a type i gene duplication event and further retention in the senegalese sole. indeed, several examples of keratin duplications have been described in zebrafish, spotted green pufferfish  and tiger puffer   <cit> . we consider that orthologous genes for sseker <dig> can be present in other teleosts, or, at least, in flatfish. nevertheless, more available molecular data will be necessary to shed light on this issue.

senegalese sole sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> showed quite different expression patterns during larval development. whereas sseker <dig> reached the highest transcript levels at s1–s <dig> metamorphic stages, sseker <dig> was mostly expressed at initial developmental stages. however, both genes reduced their transcripts levels late in metamorphosis. different expression profiles for epidermal keratin genes during metamorphic processes have also been described in anuran organisms. for example, a x. laevis  <dig> kda keratin coding gene was expressed in skin at an almost constant level during metamorphosis, while three  <dig> kda keratin coding genes were up-regulated at a later larval developmental stage and further expressed highly in the adult skin  <cit> . two other genes, xk <dig> and xk <dig>  were expressed in the epidermis from embryos to larvae  <cit> . moreover, type ii xlk was expressed exclusively in the larval skin, and type i xak-a, xak-b, and xak-c genes in adult skin  <cit> . finally, xlk <dig>  another type i keratin gene, was exclusively expressed in the larval period from hatching to late metamorphic stages  <cit> . in developmental studies of rana catesbeiana tadpoles, three epidermally expressed keratins have been further characterized: rlk and rk <dig> , and rak . during metamorphosis, no change in rk <dig> mrna levels was detected whereas rlk and rak were down- and up-regulated, respectively  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of many of these genes is differentially regulated by ths. thus,  <dig> kda keratin genes, xak-a, xak-b, xak-c, as well as rak are up-regulated by ths  <cit> . in contrast, xlk and rlk are negatively regulated  <cit> .

ths play a key role in flatfish metamorphosis. the start of the metamorphic process has been associated with a surge of ths that increase their levels until the metamorphic climax, and reduce towards post-climax  <cit> . in this survey, the possible regulation of sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> by ths was studied using tu and combined tu+t <dig> treatments. tu is a blocking agent of ths synthesis that can reduce t <dig> levels by about 95%  <cit> . exogenous treatments with tu as well as other types of thyroid inhibitors have proved useful to study the involvement of ths on metamorphosis in flatfish  <cit>  and the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the pituitary-thyroid axis  <cit> . tu-treated larvae exhibited significantly higher sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> transcript levels than controls at late metamorphosis. in contrast, addition of t <dig> reduced the amount of both sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> transcripts to similar or even significantly lower levels than those detected in controls. these results demonstrate that ths down-regulate sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> expression. the co-regulation of both keratins by ths, in spite of their distinct expression profiles during development, could explain the reduction of both keratin transcripts after the metamorphosis climax, suggesting their role in the tissue remodelling processes that occur during metamorphosis.

in fish, the absence of keratinization in adult skin seems to be a common phenomenon. immunocytochemical and rt-pcr techniques have been unable to detect epidermal keratins typical of keratinizated tissues in the adult skin of several teleosts, including c. auratus and h. hippoglossus  <cit> . thus, it has been proposed that scales and mucus present in adult skin of teleosts accomplish the same function as epidermal keratins and keratinizated skin in tetrapods, constituting a barrier against mechanical stress, parasites, pathogens, and loss of body fluids  <cit> . in fact, the presence of cystine bridges in the skin of adult senegalese sole specimens has been related to the glycoprotein nature of the mucous secretion and not to a process of keratinization of the outer most layer of the epidermis  <cit> . nevertheless, it is striking that among all tissues examined, both sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> exhibited the highest mrna levels in skin. thus, the possibility of both senegalese sole keratin proteins playing a role in resistance to mechanical or osmotic stresses cannot be ruled out. this hypothesis is also supported by the abundance of the two sseker transcripts in gills , another mucus secreting tissue involved in osmotic regulation. additionally, attractive hypotheses about other possible functions of sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> can be considered. for example, there are evidences supporting a role for keratin proteins in skin pigmentation both in human and mouse  <cit> . in the senegalese sole, skin darkness has been observed in animals under stressing conditions  <cit> . as melanin granules have been found physically associated with ifs in skin pigment cells of fish  <cit> , and there are accumulating reports of interactions of keratins  with microtubule-dependent motors  <cit> , a putative role for senegalese sole keratins in regulating the transport of melanin pigments is at least challenging. an alternative and exciting hypothesis for the possible involvement of sseker <dig> or sseker <dig> in skin pigmentation can be related to apoptotic processes. in this sense, there are findings that point to keratins as proteins involved in the regulation and execution of apoptosis  <cit> , and such apoptotic processes seem to play a role in the change of body colour in fish by modifying the morphology and density of the skin pigment cells  <cit> . moreover, it would be worthwhile to study the possible role of senegalese sole keratins as regulators of protein synthesis and epithelial cell growth through interactions with components of the translational apparatus, as described for other keratins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, in this study we describe the sequence and main features of the cdnas encoding two type i keratins in the senegalese sole, sseker <dig> and sseker <dig>  phylogenetic analyses revealed sseker <dig> as a novel type i keratin. both genes were highly expressed in skin and secondarily in gills. in contrast, they exhibited distinct expression patterns during larval development, with sseker <dig> reaching the highest transcript levels during the first metamorphic stages and sseker <dig> at first feeding. tu+t <dig> treatments demonstrated that sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> were negatively regulated by ths, suggesting their role in tissue remodelling that occurs during metamorphosis in flatfish. however, the specific function of each keratin during larval development and metamorphosis, as well as their regulation and interactions with other genes, are issues that need to be clarified in the future for the improvement of senegalese sole aquaculture conditions.
