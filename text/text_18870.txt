BACKGROUND
anabaena and nostoc species fix atmospheric n <dig> into ammonia in specialized nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts at spaced intervals along filaments of photosynthetic vegetative cells. in response to nitrogen deprivation, a transcriptional cascade controls the differentiation of heterocysts along the filament. hetr is a key transcription factor required for heterocyst development and diazotrophic growth. hetr mutant strains are blocked at an early stage of heterocyst differentiation  <cit> . in anabaena sp. strain pcc <dig>  overexpression of hetr results in multiple contiguous heterocysts  in nitrate-containing medium, showing that hetr alone can trigger heterocyst development and override normal nutritional queues  <cit> . hetr is expressed at a basal level in vegetative cells and its expression increases in heterocysts early after nitrogen deprivation  <cit> . the crystal structure of hetr from fischerella strain mv <dig> shows that hetr forms a dimer and contains helix-turn-helix motifs in the n-terminal regions of the monomers, forming a dna-binding region flanked by globular histidine-rich flaps  <cit> . the c-terminal regions form a hood associated with the central core.

hetr has been shown to bind dna with electrophoretic mobility shift assays, but its dna target sequence is still not fully understood  <cit> . hetr binds in vitro to dna fragments upstream of several genes upregulated in heterocysts, including hetz, hetp, hepa, pkne, pats, and hetr itself  <cit> . hetr binds strongly to a 17-bp inverted repeat, 5′-gaggggtctaacccctc-3′, in the hetp promoter, but this sequence is not found in other hetr-regulated promoters  <cit> . a consensus target sequence derived from hetp promoters from several cyanobacterial strains was determined to be 5′-tnantngngggtcaancccanca-3′, and crystal structures of hetr in a complex with three different lengths of a dna target based on this consensus sequence revealed details of the protein-dna interaction that define a requirement for the sequence gggnnnnnccc, where n can be any base  <cit> . a study that identified the hetr binding site upstream of hetz suggested that the hetr binding site is related to the imperfect palindrome gggtctagcccagca  <cit> , but this site is not upstream of all known hetr targets, including the pats gene, which is involved in heterocyst pattern regulation  <cit> .

a genome-wide map of transcription start sites  in the wild type and a hetr mutant strain after nitrogen deprivation for 8 h identified a “dif”  tss category that depends on hetr for upregulation  <cit> . a dif+ sequence motif, tccgga, centered near the − <dig> position, was found in many heterocyst-specific promoters, but the previously identified hetr binding site was not found to be conserved in these promoters  <cit> . this study could not distinguish between direct and indirect effects on expression levels.

genes encoding hetr are conserved in conjunction with pats genes in both heterocystous and nonheterocystous cyanobacteria  <cit> . pats and hetr are thought to act together to regulate the spacing of heterocysts  <cit> . a small pentapeptide rgsgr motif in pats and hetn is sufficient to inhibit heterocyst formation  <cit>  and pats peptides can bind directly to the hetr dimer with pats- <dig> binding the tightest  <cit> . because hetr and pats are conserved in cyanobacteria that do not form heterocysts, and because hetr is expressed at low levels in vegetative cells, it is possible that hetr and pats serve a function in addition to their known roles in heterocyst development  <cit> . hetr has two protein interaction domains, suggesting that other proteins may modulate hetr’s activity and dna binding  <cit> . however, very little is known about hetr’s possible role outside heterocyst development or about its target genes in nonheterocystous cyanobacteria.

we employed chromatin pull-down  and deep sequencing to give a global view of hetr’s in vivo dna-binding sites in both vegetative cells and proheterocysts six hours after induction. chip assays have been used to map dna binding sites for rna polymerase and two transcription factors in the cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig>  <cit> . a recent study used chip-seq to examine the ntca dna binding sites in anabaena sp. pcc <dig> at three hours after withdrawal of combined nitrogen  <cit> . this study found ntca binding regions associated with over two thousand genes. we applied chip-seq to hetr because identifying its potential target sites and its regulon would be a significant step forward in understanding the set of genes required for heterocyst development. we isolated 6xhis-tagged hetr bound to dna at six hours after the removal of combined nitrogen and used deep sequencing to identify all regions of the genome enriched for hetr binding. chip-seq, which identifies a protein’s in vivo binding sites under specific growth conditions, has the potential of identifying hetr targets that would not be identified with other methods. we developed a chip protocol for hetr in anabaena and optimized the downstream data analysis. we used chip-seq to identify potential hetr target genes and to produce a consensus dna-binding site, and we used promoter-gfp fusions to study the spatial and temporal expression of four of these genes.

RESULTS
to identify potential members of the hetr regulon at an early stage of heterocyst development and to determine a consensus hetr binding site, we identified hetr dna targets at six hours after combined-nitrogen deprivation with chip-seq. hetr is known to be expressed and regulate “early” target genes at this time point  <cit> . cells from a wild-type  control strain and hetr mutant strain uhm <dig> carrying pam <dig>  which expresses tagged hetr-6xhis and produced a nearly normal heterocyst phenotype, were exposed to crosslinking agents in vivo and his-tagged hetr bound to its dna targets was then affinity precipitated. chip dna samples were then subjected to deep sequencing on the illumina hiseq platform, and reads were aligned to the anabaena pcc <dig> genome. the clc genomics workbench  <dig> chip-seq algorithm was used to search for chip peaks with the wt sample as a nonspecific control. the algorithm found  <dig> chip peaks with a 5% false discovery rate  and a 100-bp window for the poisson distribution .

hetr binding site consensus sequence
from the  <dig> identified chip peaks, we analyzed each peak region by eye to confirm a 3-fold enrichment in reads of the chip peak over wild type and a twin peak morphology, indicative of a transcription factor binding to dna. in addition, we excluded peaks that were not upstream of a gene that is misregulated in a ∆hetr background, as determined by rna-seq analysis of a ∆hetr mutant at  <dig> and 6 hours after nitrogen deprivation , and peaks that were not in a 5′ untranslated region  or near a potential tss as identified by our rna-seq data  <cit>  or by differential rna-seq  <cit> . we queried the resulting  <dig> chip regions  with fimo  for the previously defined hetr binding site  <cit>  with a p value of 10− <dig>  fimo found  <dig> potential hetr binding sites near  <dig> of the  <dig> chip peaks . several chip peaks, for example the broad peaks associated with the hetr and hetp genes, contained multiple potential hetr binding sites in addition to the previously characterized sites  <cit> . hetr dimers might individually bind to these multiple sites, but it is possible that multiple binding sites could result in hetr tetramer formation  <cit> , which could be involved in the regulation of certain promoters.table  <dig>

we used the meme suite to align the  <dig> discovered potential hetr binding sites identified with fimo to produce a consensus hetr binding site . a key difference between the chip-seq consensus hetr binding site and previously identified sites  <cit>  include a conserved “a” residue two bases upstream of the triple g repeat. the chip-seq consensus hetr binding site shows little to no conservation of the nucleotides downstream of the ccc bases.figure  <dig> 
gene ontology categories for hetr chip peaks, and the consensus hetr binding site. a. go term gene categories for hetr target genes identified by chip. significant enrichment in the go term categories “heterocyst differentiation” and “transposon related functions” was seen in potential targets of hetr as identified by chip. these two categories were enriched at least 3-fold over their relative proportion in the genome as a whole. each go term is labeled with the percent of chip hits that fall within that category. b. fold enrichment of hetr-chip target go terms over their representation in the anabaena genome. for example, the category “heterocyst differentiation” is represented over  <dig> times more often in the hetr-chip targets than would be expected from a random sampling of the genome. c. hetr consensus binding site in meme format. twenty chip peaks were queried with fimo for the previously identified hetr binding site gggtctagcccagca.  <dig> discovered sites were then aligned with the meme suite to produce a consensus hetr binding site.



we performed mobility shift assays with affinity purified gst-hetr protein  <cit>  and biotin-labeled oligonucleotides for nine potential hetr binding sites. although we obtained a shifted band for a hetp positive control fragment, we failed to obtain distinct shifted bands for the newly identified potential targets . however, for six of the nine oligonucleotides, there was a clear decrease in the free probe band and a shifted more slowly migrating diffuse smear in the presence of gst-hetr compared to a gst control, which indicates interaction between these dna probes and the hetr protein. these six binding sites were upstream of the genes pata, all1467/alr <dig>  asr <dig>  all <dig>  alr <dig>  and all <dig>  alternative biophysical methods will be required to further characterize the hetr interaction with these dna binding sites.

the  <dig> chip peak regions were near some genes that have been reported to contain hetr binding sites, including hetr, hetp, and pata, but most of the genes represent potential new hetr targets . a few genes that have been shown to be regulated by hetr, including hetz, pats, and pkne, were not associated with the chip-seq regions identified in this study. however, hetr is thought to potentially interact with other factors  <cit> , and these partners may affect binding and could be different at different times and in different cell types. because our chip sample was collected at 6 h after nitrogen removal, the consensus binding site we have defined would be dependent on hetr concentration and other factors present at that time point. furthermore, our chip data are from hetr present in all cells in each filament, which includes both early proheterocysts and vegetative cells. therefore, our binding sites may be skewed towards hetr targets in vegetative cells compared to previous analyses, which focused on hetr’s role in regulating heterocyst-specific genes.

go term enrichment in hetr targets
genes in seven gene ontology  categories were enriched in our chip peak sample set with respect to their abundance in the genome, such as “heterocyst differentiation,” “adaptations and atypical conditions,” “transcription,” and “transposon related functions” . as expected, genes involved in heterocyst differentiation, including genes such as hetr, hetp, hetc, and pata, were enriched as targets for hetr. we did not initially expect transposases to be potentially regulated by hetr. however, genes for transposon-related functions were enriched in our hetr-chip data and were also upregulated in response to nitrogen deprivation in previously published rna-seq data  <cit> . seven of the original  <dig> hetr chip peaks were associated with transposase genes. it seems unlikely that these interactions are part of the regulatory network that regulates the response to nitrogen deprivation or heterocyst development, and it is probably more likely that these transposases have hijacked hetr regulation as a signal of cellular stress, which is known to activate transposons in other systems.

promoter-gfp fusions for hetr targets
we chose four potential hetr targets for further analysis of their temporal and spatial regulation in response to nitrogen deprivation, and also discuss pata, which was identified in our chip-seq experiments . four of these targets, pata, asr <dig>  asl <dig>  and alr <dig> contain a potential hetr-binding sequence while all <dig> does not. each of these genes was downregulated at either  <dig> or 6 h in a ∆hetr strain, and alr <dig> and alr <dig> are upregulated more than 2-fold in response to nitrogen deprivation . to analyze the temporal and spatial expression of these genes in response to nitrogen deprivation, we fused the potential promoter region of each gene to a gfp reporter gene in both wild-type anabaena and strain uhm <dig>  a markerless knockout mutant of hetr  <cit> . for the three genes that have putative hetr binding sites, asr <dig>  asl <dig>  and alr <dig>  we also fused a truncated version of the promoter, missing the hetr binding site, to gfp. for each of the truncated promoter fusions , we detected little to no gfp fluorescence . it is possible that by truncating these promoters, we also removed other signals in addition to the hetr binding site that are important for gene expression.table  <dig>

the asr <dig> gene was of interest because it is near three hetr chip-seq peaks and is present on the fdxn element, which is excised from the chromosome in heterocysts  <cit> . the asr <dig> gene encodes a small protein conserved in a few diverse cyanobacteria but with no known domain homologies. genome context provides no additional information because unknown and hypothetical genes surround asr <dig>  the full-length asr <dig> promoter driving gfp in wt cells produced weak gfp fluorescence in all cells in n + conditions . after nitrogen deprivation, gfp fluorescence was increased in 63% of heterocysts at 21 hours, while the remaining heterocysts showed either gfp fluorescence similar to vegetative cell levels  or no gfp signal . however, by 25 hours after the removal of combined nitrogen, only 25% of heterocysts showed high gfp fluorescence and 65% showed no gfp fluorescence, while the remaining 10% of heterocysts showed gfp fluorescence similar to that of vegetative cells. therefore, the asr <dig> gene appears to be transiently upregulated in heterocysts during heterocyst differentiation while maintaining a lower level of expression in vegetative cells. very low to no gfp expression from the full-length asr <dig> promoter was observed in a ∆hetr background .

rna-seq data showed that asr <dig> is expressed at a low level with a four-fold decrease in expression in the ∆hetr strain at 0 h, but no significant regulation of the gene in response to nitrogen deprivation. it is likely that the changes in transcription of asr <dig> seen with the gfp-reporter fusion are too transient to be detected with rna-seq of rna from whole filaments measured at discreet time points. however, the promoter-gfp fusion suggests that asr <dig> transcription is dependent on hetr because expression of gfp required both hetr protein and the full-length promoter containing the putative hetr binding site . because the function of asr <dig> is unknown, the reason for its transient up-regulation in heterocysts is unclear.

the alr <dig> gene encodes a potential anti-sigma factor antagonist. rna-seq data for alr <dig> shows that it is essentially off in nitrate-containing medium and upregulated early in response to combined-nitrogen deprivation . no rna-seq reads were present for alr <dig> in a ∆hetr background, indicating that its expression is dependent on hetr. the full-length alr3758-gfp upstream promoter fusion was expressed at a very low level in wt and ∆hetr vegetative cells grown on nitrate . after removal of combined nitrogen, the reporter fusion showed increased gfp fluorescence in heterocysts of the wt by 21 hours . this suggests that alr <dig> is upregulated in a heterocyst specific manner and may be involved in the inactivation of an anti-sigma factor to allow gene expression of heterocyst-specific genes. there are at least three sigma factors that are upregulated in heterocysts after nitrogen deprivation  <cit> , and alr <dig> may play a role in allowing one or more of these sigma factors to access their promoters by sequestering or inactivating an anti-sigma factor in heterocysts.

the asl <dig> gene encodes a hypothetical protein that is conserved in only a few species of cyanobacteria. the asl <dig> gene is upstream of two genes annotated to encode nitrile hydratases, proteins involved in metabolism of nitriles as a combined nitrogen source, and downstream of a gene for a heme biosynthesis protein. in the wt, the full-length asl2028-gfp fusion showed moderate gfp fluorescence in uninduced vegetative cells and the truncated promoter showed no gfp fluorescence . in the hetr mutant background, gfp fluorescence was evident but quite dim. at  <dig> and 12 hours after the removal of combined nitrogen in the wt, there was an increase in gfp fluorescence in vegetative and proheterocyst cells along the entire filament . after nitrogen deprivation in the ∆hetr strain, fluorescence remained at the low level observed in the uninduced sample, showing that hetr is required for full expression of this promoter. by 21 hours after the removal of combined nitrogen, the asl <dig> promoter was still active in wt vegetative cells, but it was off in mature heterocysts.

the promoter-gfp fusion data indicate that asl <dig> is a vegetative cell specific gene. our gfp-reporter data provide useful information on cell-type expression patterns and on qualitative differences in expression levels for different promoters and under different conditions such as nitrogen depletion, but these data are not quantitative. therefore, the changes in expression observed with the asl2028-gfp reporter cannot provide conclusive evidence that asl <dig> is regulated by hetr. however, quantitative rna-seq data  show a decrease in asl <dig> expression in the hetr mutant that is consistent with the gfp-reporter results. hetr is expressed in vegetative cells and it has been suggested that it may be involved in the repression of some vegetative cell gene targets  <cit> . the asl <dig> gene is possibly an example of a gene that is at least partially upregulated by hetr in vegetative cells. hetr is conserved in non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria  <cit>  and we have observed that the ∆hetr strain grows slightly slower and is more clumpy than wild type cells. therefore, it is possible that hetr has a role in gene expression in vegetative cells, and asl <dig> may be a hetr target that plays a part in that role.

the alr <dig> gene encodes a protein in the highly conserved nacht family of ntpases. proteins containing this domain include proteins involved in signal transduction, dna binding, and some kinesin motor proteins  <cit> . although there was a strong enrichment of the alr <dig> 5′ and promoter region in our chip-seq data, we could not identify a potential hetr binding site upstream of alr <dig> with fimo. it is possible that hetr binds a yet unidentified site in this promoter, possibly in combination with another protein or proteins. rna-seq data showed a  <dig> -fold induction of alr <dig> at 21 h after nitrogen deprivation . although there was no clear change in alr <dig> message level in the hetr mutant in vegetative cells grown with nitrate , there was a large decrease in the hetr mutant at 6 h after nitrogen deprivation .

the alr <dig> promoter region driving a gfp reporter on pam <dig> showed no fluorescence in wt cells grown with nitrate, and weak vegetative cell-specific expression at 21 hours after nitrogen deprivation . no expression was observed in mature heterocysts. however, surprisingly, strong gfp fluorescence was produced in vegetative cells grown with nitrate in the ∆hetr mutant background . this phenotype was observed for three independent exconjugant strains containing the pam <dig> plasmid. although there are potential alternative explanations for this result, the simplest conclusion is that hetr suppresses the alr <dig> promoter in vegetative cells grown on nitrate-containing medium. in contrast to the promoter-gfp fusion data, rna-seq data showed essentially no difference in alr <dig> rpkm values between the wt and the ∆hetr strain at 0 h . these contrasting results are presumably because the gfp reporter data are a measure of promoter activity and the rna-seq data measure mrna levels, and suggest that the alr <dig> mrna may be relatively unstable in the hetr mutant. alternatively, the alr <dig> promoter-gfp mrna could be an unusually stable transcript, but this effect has never been reported in the large number of studies that have used gfp-reporter fusions in anabaena. the alr <dig> gene appears to have its own promoter  but potentially could also be expressed as part of an operon with two upstream genes. further work will be required to understand the regulation of alr <dig> and the potential role of hetr in repressing its expression in vegetative cells grown on nitrate.figure  <dig>

pata is a well-studied protein involved in heterocyst development, and previous studies have shown that expression of pata increases in a heterocyst-specific manner after nitrogen deprivation  <cit> . pata-gfp expression is low in a wild-type background, but in a ∆pata strain in n- conditions pata-gfp is expressed in all cells with the highest expression in heterocysts  <cit> . the increased expression in the ∆pata strain required hetr. this suggests that pata is a target of hetr in both vegetative and heterocyst cells and that its accumulation in heterocysts may be due to an increase in hetr levels. a pata-gfp translational fusion shows that pata forms ftsz-like rings around the middle of cells  <cit> . a ∆pata strain only differentiates heterocysts at the ends of filaments in n- media  <cit> , but pata overexpression produces aberrant cell morphology and increased heterocyst frequency  <cit> . therefore, it has been suggested that pata is involved in the coupling of cell division and heterocyst differentiation  <cit> .

pata is expressed in vegetative cells prior to nitrogen deprivation and its expression increases in heterocysts in n- media  <cit> . our in vivo chip data identified a chip-seq peak region associated with the pata gene, which is consistent with recent bioinformatic analysis that identified a potential hetr binding site upstream of pata  <cit> . rna-seq analysis of a ∆hetr strain showed an 8-fold decrease in pata transcription in the absence of hetr . it is possible that pata and hetr regulate one another through a feedback loop both in vegetative cells and during heterocyst development, as both of these dna-binding proteins appear to affect one another in overexpression and gene knockout experiments  <cit> . our chip-seq data support the hypothesis that hetr directly regulates pata transcription during the response to nitrogen deprivation.

CONCLUSIONS
we employed a combination of chip-seq and rna-seq to examine the hetr regulon at six hours after nitrogen deprivation, when hetr is known to be involved in the activation of some heterocyst-specific genes. the chip-seq data produced a set of  <dig> regions that potentially are bound by hetr protein. twenty of these regions were found to contain one or more putative hetr binding sites, and analysis of the resulting  <dig> sites was used to produce a consensus hetr binding site . the genes near the  <dig> chip peak regions include several that have been reported to contain hetr binding sites, including hetr, hetp, and pata, but most of the genes represent new potential hetr targets. future chip-seq studies from different times during heterocyst development may result in identifying additional hetr targets because it is likely that hetr binding to dna is affected by hetr concentration and influenced by other factors that may be present at different times or under different conditions than those used in this study.

these chip-seq data have expanded our understanding of the hetr regulon and identified new promoter regions that are potentially regulated by hetr, including some that do not contain a canonical hetr binding site. using gfp reporter fusions to selected promoter regions potentially regulated by hetr, we found that the asr <dig> promoter is transiently upregulated in heterocysts, the alr <dig> promoter is upregulated in heterocysts, and the alr <dig> promoter is derepressed in nitrate-grown vegetative cells of a hetr mutant strain. the hetr and pats genes are present in some cyanobacterial strains that do not make heterocysts  <cit> , and the potential hetr targets identified in this study may include genes that are regulated by hetr in vegetative cells, which could guide future studies to determine hetr’s role outside of heterocyst development.
