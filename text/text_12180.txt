BACKGROUND
one of the major goals in biological process development is to increase the productivity of fermentation processes, in particular, to increase the amount of protein produced per cell . advantages thereof are usually less effort for product purification, lower fermentation volumes and, thus, smaller bioreactors that are needed to produce a certain amount of product. this can lead to significant cost reductions. the specific productivity can be influenced by genetic engineering of strains, choice of the host/vector system , media optimization or process optimization   <cit> . in particular, the induction time is probably the most crucial factor for inducible recombinant expression systems  <cit> . therefore, it is important to screen different induction times, especially if other means of increasing productivity should be evaluated.

another widespread concept to increase specific productivity is to decouple biomass build-up from product formation  <cit> . when recombinant proteins are produced in growing cells, energy and nutritional resources are often directed toward biomass production rather than target protein formation  <cit> . to circumvent this, the idea is to use cells that are non-growing  yet are metabolically active and capable of producing protein at higher levels. rowe and summers designed such a system  using a genetically modified e.coli strain that provides a higher specific productivity by decreasing chromosomal gene expression  in favor of plasmid-encoded gene expression  <cit> . another concept is to induce protein expression in the stationary phase of a batch culture  <cit> . here, the gene of interest is placed under the control of a starvation-inducible promoter that is turned on when glucose becomes exhausted  <cit> . compared with exponentially growing cells, stationary phase cells are far more resistent to stress  <cit>  and might therefore be suited to produce recombinant proteins  <cit> , as this can place a huge metabolic burden on the cells  <cit> . another starvation-inducible promoter is based on the alkaline phosphatase  gene. when phosphate is depleted in the medium, the target genes under the control of the phoa promoter are induced  <cit> . this system is described for the expression of a number of recombinant proteins  <cit> . a further possibility to limit growth and hereby enhance product formation is to limit secondary substrates such as magnesium, potassium or especially phosphate in the cultivation medium  <cit> .

phosphate - being one of the most abundant elements in e.coli in terms of the cellular content - plays a crucial role in the cell. wanner summarized many aspects of the role of phosphate on cell's structure and function  <cit> . this includes the incorporation of inorganic phosphate in membrane lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and other cellular metabolites. here, phosphate also acts as an effector of enzymatic reactions  <cit>  and is thus involved in many metabolic pathways, especially in the energy metabolism of the cell . furthermore, polyphosphate acts as an energy- and phosphate-storing polymer that is used during phosphate limitation  <cit> . because of this universal role of phosphate, a limitation of this nutrient has tremendous effects on the cell growth and physiology. therefore, many genes are found to be regulated by the level of inorganic phosphate in the medium  <cit> . a phosphate exhaustion in an e.coli cultivation leads to activation of the pho regulon  <cit> . furthermore, the rpos response is triggered  <cit>  and cells enter the stationary phase  <cit> . due to phosphate limitation, the expression of hundreds of proteins is induced and, at the same time, the levels of more than two hundred proteins are reduced  <cit> . in summary, a phosphate limitation leads to quite complex regulatory mechanisms in the cell and is still not yet fully understood on the molecular level.

nevertheless, phosphate exhaustion has been shown to bolster product formation. this was recently proved in batch cultures for a catabolite-repressed hansensula polymorpha strain with glucose or glycerol as carbon source  <cit> . jensen and carlsen cultivated an e.coli strain with an constitutive promoter for a recombinant protein in fed-batch mode. by limiting phosphate in the medium they were able to stop the biomass build-up and enhance specific productivity  <cit> . a similar effect could be achieved for producing shikimic acid in e.coli in a phosphate-limited chemostat culture  <cit>  and for lysine production with corynebacterium glutamicum  <cit> . however, besides using the phoa promoter, there are only few reports on phosphate-limited batch cultivations of e. coli  <cit> . moreover, there are no reports specifically on using phosphate limitation with the most common inducible promoter system, i.e. the t <dig> or lac promoter, to enhance specific productivity of recombinant protein expression. the reason for this might be the difficulty to establish optimal conditions for inducing protein expression in phosphate-limited cultures. for this purpose, many experiments have to be conducted in parallel batch cultures to determine the best phosphate content of the medium and the optimal time of induction. so far, such studies are very tedious with conventional means  experiments with offline-measurement of growth and manual induction of protein expression at an appropiate time).

hence, the aim of this work was to investigate different induction times and in particular to increase specific productivity of a t <dig> expression system via phosphate limitation. therefore, the influence of phosphate on growth and recombinant protein expression  in batch cultures was studied with specific online-monitoring tools for small scale cultivations, namely ramos  <cit>  and biolector  <cit> . furthermore, a novel cultivation platform  was applied  <cit> . this system conducts high-throughput experiments in mtps automatically and allows to monitor microbial growth and the production of fluorescence proteins online.

methods
microorganism
for all experiments the strain e.coli bl <dig> prhothi-2-ecfbfp was used   <cit> . the used expression plasmid harbors a kanamycin resistence gene and the t <dig> promoter that is under the control of the lac operator. the fluorescent protein ecfbfp is expressed as a model protein. therefore, the ecfbfp encoding gene was cloned into the prhothi- <dig> vector downstream of the t <dig> promoter. a his6-tag was fused to the c-terminus of the ecfbfp resulting in a recombinant fusion protein with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the used ecfbfp is also available under the trademark evoglow .

media and solutions
for all precultures tb-medium was used, consisting of  <dig> g/l yeast extract,  <dig> g/l tryptone,  <dig>  g/l k2hpo <dig>   <dig>  g/l kh2po <dig> and  <dig> g/l glycerol. the medium was supplemented with kanamycin  and the ph was adjusted to  <dig>  with naoh.

all main cultivations were performed in a modified form of wilms & reuss synthetic medium  <cit> . the medium consists of  <dig>  g/l glucose,  <dig> g/l 2so <dig>   <dig>  g/l nh4cl,  <dig> g/l k2hpo <dig> ,  <dig> g/l na2so <dig>   <dig>  g/l mgso4•7h2o,  <dig>  g/l 3--propanesulfonic acid ,  <dig>  g/l thiamine hydrochloride,  <dig> ml/l trace element solutions. for determining the phosphate demand of the applied strain, different media were prepared with the following phosphate concentrations :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  all media preparations were supplemented with kanamycin  and the ph was adjusted to  <dig>  with naoh.

for induction of protein expression a sterile-filtered iptg stock solution  was used to give a final iptg concentration of  <dig>  mm in the cultures. this concentration was identified in previous experiments to be suitable for efficient recombinant protein expression . all reagents were of analytical grade and supplied by carl roth gmbh & co. kg .

cultivation
preculture
the precultures for all experiments were inoculated from a cryoculture of e.coli bl <dig> prhothi-2-ecfbfp and cultivated in a  <dig> ml erlenmeyer shake flask with  <dig> ml tb-medium. the flask was placed on a rotary shaker at a shaking frequency  of  <dig> rpm, a shaking diameter  of  <dig> mm and at a temperature  of 37°c for  <dig> h . to ensure that no disturbing media components from the preculture medium - especially phosphate - influence the limitation experiments, the harvested cells were washed twice. therefore, cells of the preculture were pelleted by centrifugation at  <dig> rpm and resuspended in phosphate-free modified wilms & reuss medium. after two washing steps, the subsequent main cultures were inoculated to give an initial optical density  of  <dig> . od was measured at  <dig> nm with a uvikon  <dig> spectrophotometer .

microtiter plate cultivations
cultivations in mtps were conducted in a biolector  <cit>  which is a system that can permanently monitor microbial growth and the fluorescence of reporter proteins under defined conditions in a mtp during the cultivation. therefore, a mtp with medium is inoculated and placed in the incubation chamber of the biolector . the mtp is continuously shaken to provide a sufficient oxygen transfer to the culture. for growth and product monitoring, light with a defined wavelength is sent into each well , whereas the backscattered light  or fluorescence  is detected and analysed. in this study, the experiments to determine the phosphate demand and the influence of phosphate limitation on protein production were conducted in a biolector prototype  <cit> .

the screening for the optimal induction time was carried out with the robo-lector platform described by huber et al.  <cit> . the robo-lector platform consists of a biolector   <cit>  integrated into a pipetting robot . this system enables one to conduct automated high-throughput cultivations. here, the method 'induction profiling' was used, which performs an automated induction of parallel cultures by the pipetting of iptg-solutions in the respective wells of a main culture mtp at different times. for a detailed description of the method please refer to huber et al. . the method was used with the following modifications: the induction time was varied from  <dig> to  <dig> h and the inducer concentration was kept constant at  <dig>  mm. the following conditions were applied for all cultivations in the biolector prototype and the robo-lector: 37°c, shaking diameter  <dig> mm, shaking frequency  <dig> rpm. all cultivations were performed in sterile black  <dig> well mtp  with an initial filling volume of  <dig> μl  or  <dig> μl . to avoid evaporation, each utilized mtp were sealed with a gas-permeable adhesive seal  for the cultivations in the biolector prototype. for the robo-lector experiments, the mtp was sealed with sterile pierceable, resealable tape , allowing ventilation of the wells at reduced evaporation rates. the ecfbfp fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of  <dig> nm and an emission wavelength of  <dig> nm. the resulting fluorescence is a suitable quantitative signal for in-vivo ecfbfp expression  <cit>  and therefore corresponds to the total volumetric yield of the target protein ecfbfp. the biomass concentration was measured via scattered light intensity  and was detected at an excitation wavelength of  <dig> nm. the initial scattered light intensity  was mainly attributed to factors such as the media background or the type of the mtp and thus was substracted from the residual scattered light data   <cit>  or fluorescence data . different signal gain factors for scattered light and fluorescence were used as stated in the figure captions. the specific productivity for ecfbfp expression in the mtp cultivations was defined as ecfbfp fluorescence per scattered light intensity .

ramos cultivations
the ramos device provides analysis of microbial growth in shake flasks by measuring the respiratory activity of the microorganisms  <cit> . the respiration activity  in different phosphate-containing cultures was measured with the ramos device in modified  <dig> ml erlenmeyer shake flasks with a filling volume of  <dig> ml. shake flasks with  <dig> mg/l,  <dig> mg/l and  <dig> mg/l k2hpo <dig> were cultured in duplicate. all cultivations were carried out with a shaking frequency of  <dig> rpm and at a shaking diameter of  <dig> mm on a lab-shaker ls-k  at t = 37°c. to determine po43-, glucose and acetate concentrations, separate shake flasks were cultured in a lab-shaker ls-k under identical conditions as in the ramos device. from these shake flasks samples were collected approximately every  <dig> h. phosphate  was analysed using a photometric kit . po43- has a molar fraction of 55% in k2hpo <dig>  hence  <dig> mg/l k2hpo <dig> correspond to  <dig> mg/l po43-,  <dig> mg/l k2hpo <dig> correspond to  <dig> mg/l po43- and  <dig> mg/l k2hpo <dig> correspond to  <dig> mg/l po43-. glucose and acetate were measured in duplicate via hplc  on an organic acid resin  at 60°c with  <dig> mm h2so <dig> as eluent.

shake flask cultivations
shake flask experiments were conducted to verify results from the mtp scale. these cultures were grown in  <dig> ml erlenmeyer shake flasks which were filled with  <dig> ml modified wilms & reuss medium with different phosphate concentrations  at a shaking frequency of  <dig> rpm, a shaking diameter of  <dig> mm and 37°c. the cultures were induced with iptg  after  <dig> h of growth. after  <dig> hours, the od of the cultures was measured and cells were harvested to perform product analysis via sds-page. furthermore, scattered light and fluorescence intensities of culture samples  were measured in the biolector prototype.

sds-page and densitometry
sds-page was performed to correlate the specific productivities of the shake flask cultivations with different phosphate concentrations. the sds-page was conducted with the xcell surelock minicell  and a bis-tris-gel  according to the manufacturer's instructions. normalized samples were prepared by suspending equal amounts of cells from the shake flask experiments in sds-buffer and loading them on the gel. additionally, a molecular weight standard  was loaded on the gel. after electrophoresis, the gel was stained and destained according to the manufacturer's instructions . the destained gel was photographed with the documentation system chemidoc  and analyzed with the densitometry computer program total lab tl <dig>  to determine the specific productivity of the different samples. the specific productivity was defined as the ratio of the density of the target protein band  to the total density of all bands of the corresponding sample .

RESULTS
effects of phosphate limitation on growth
the aim of this study was to examine the effects of a phosphate limitation on the growth of the e.coli strain bl <dig> prhothi-2-ecfbfp and its recombinant product formation. first of all, the growth behavior at different phosphate concentrations was investigated in the biolector device. a graduated growth pattern resulted from this experiment . when no phosphate was added to the medium  there was nevertheless some growth visible. this might be explained by some residual phosphate from the preculture  and most likely because of intracellular polyphosphate stores which were mobilized during phosphate starvation  <cit> . the phosphate content of the original medium was  <dig> mg/l, and this culture showed a typical batch culture curve with exponential growth. the stationary phase began at approximately  <dig> h with a biomass concentration of  <dig> a.u. . this culture was phosphate unlimited, whereas the cultures with  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l reached a slightly higher scattered light intensity. this could be explained by the fact that excess phosphate in the medium  could form a complex with trace elements  and this, in turn, led to a slightly lower biomass yield compared to  <dig> or  <dig> mg/l phosphate. the cultures with less than  <dig> mg/l phosphate showed lower biomass yields as phosphate became more and more limited. this correlation can also be seen in figure 2b, where an almost linear relationship between biomass yield  and phosphate content of the medium becomes apparent. from such a depiction, the minimal phosphate demand of the cells for unlimited growth  could easily be determined  <cit> . all cultures with phosphate showed the same increase in scattered light intensities in the beginning , indicating a comparable maximum specific growth rate . as soon as phosphate became limited, these cultures deviated from the unlimited cultures and then continued with slow growth until they reached a plateau . this slight increase in biomass concentration had been shown elsewhere  <cit>  and seemed typical because of the metabolism of intercellular phosphate reserves. with the approach to monitor growth in mtps, the demand of the examined e.coli strain for phosphate could be investigated in detail. futhermore, the time when phosphate became limited was derived from the online-monitored growth curves.

in order to verify these results, a cultivation in the ramos system was conducted with three selected phosphate concentrations . derived from the results of figure  <dig>  a culture with  <dig> mg/l dipotassium phosphate was chosen as reference for phosphate unlimited conditions. besides that, cultivations with  <dig> mg/l and  <dig> mg/l k2hpo <dig> were conducted to represent intermediate and strong phosphate limitations, respectively. the unlimited culture showed a typical exponential growth reaching a maximal otr of  <dig> mmol/l/h after  <dig> h. at this time, the otr decreased sharply, showing a second small peak at  <dig> to  <dig> h. this behavior is typical for an e.coli batch cultivation where the primary carbon source, namely glucose, became exhausted  and the overflow metabolite acetate was consumed subsequently . although glucose, acetate and phosphate were not measured in shorter intervals, numerous studies dealing with the interpretation of otr curves for microbial cultivations affirm this interpretation . phosphate became not limited with  <dig> mg/l k2hpo <dig> . the otr of the limited culture with  <dig> mg/l k2hpo <dig> started to stagnate at an otr of  <dig> mmol/l/h after  <dig> to  <dig> h when phosphate limitation began . after  <dig> h, the otr dropped again, because glucose was exhausted. this culture showed a second short otr plateau at about  <dig> h, mainly because of the metabolism of the hitherto produced acetate. the  <dig> mg/l-culture  showed a similar pattern, although the otr reached only  <dig> mmol/l/h at its maximum and slowly decreased until glucose was exhausted after about  <dig> to  <dig> h. this behavior is typical for a limitation of secondary substrates such as phosphate  <cit> . the culture started phosphate-limited growth after  <dig> to  <dig> h and showed a second small otr plateau after  <dig> h, obviously because the residual amounts of acetate or other, not measured by-products were consumed. these findings, especially the times when phosphate limitation started and glucose was exhausted, are in good agreement with the growth data from the biolector .

the above results clearly showed that after a limitation of phosphate, the cells stagnated in growth and exhibited a prolonged respiration activity due to the ongoing consumption of the primary substrate  for maintenance. similar results have been found with extensive offline analysis of growth, phosphate and glucose in a bioreactor  <cit> . the measurement of the respiration activity provided valueable insight into the metabolism of the cells and confirmed the proposed events during phoshate limitation. the period of a stagnating otr depicted in figure  <dig>  represented a time of metabolic activity yet reduced growth of the cells and might be used to decouple recombinant protein expression from biomass growth.

effects of phosphate limitation on protein expression
a biolector experiment was conducted to study in detail the general effects of a phosphate limitation on the expression of the fluorescence protein ecfbfp. therefore, an intermediate phosphate concentration  was chosen. besides this, also the unlimited medium was used as a reference. from the results of figure  <dig> and  <dig> an induction time of  <dig> to  <dig> h was chosen because at that time the phosphate became limited . the unlimited  <dig> mg/l-culture grew to a scattered light intensity of  <dig> a.u. , whereas the  <dig> mg/l-culture reached only  <dig> a.u. . the unlimited culture immediately started to express the fluorescent protein ecfbfp upon induction and reached a plateau at a fluorescence of  <dig> a.u. .

after this culture consumed all the glucose, it reached stationary phase  and the cells had no longer the resources  to express the target protein. on the other hand, the limited culture exhibited a much greater ecfbfp fluorescence  upon induction, even when the important nutrient phosphate was limited . the production of ecfbfp continued until  <dig> h , though the cells did not grow anymore. although a lower biomass was available in the phosphate-limited culture, even more ecfbfp was produced than in the unlimited culture. accordingly, the specific productivity  at the end of the cultivation was higher for limited conditions  than for the unlimited culture . this provided evidence that phosphate-limited cells are still capable to produce recombinant proteins. the phosphate unlimited culture in this experiment was induced almost in the stationary phase and hence had only little resources left for efficient ecfbfp expression. furthermore, the time of induction is probably the most crucial factor for recombinant protein expression  <cit> . therefore, it is important to screen at different induction times for phosphate-limited and -unlimited cultures to evaluate if a phosphate limitation is generally suitable to enhance specific productivity.

for such a screening, a novel cultivation platform for automated high-throughput experimentation  <cit>  was used. this system consists of a biolector integrated into a liquid handling workstation. with this platform, it is possible to automatically induce up to  <dig> parallel cultures in a mtp at different times. this method, called 'induction profiling'  <cit> , was modified here to test  <dig> different induction times  for phosphate-limited  or unlimited cultures .

in summary, the optimal time of induction could efficiently be determined with the applied experimental setup and revealed that the induction time was the predominant parameter for the overall expression yield. furthermore it became obvious that phosphate limitation could only further enhance product formation when an appropiate induction time was chosen. these effects could easily be investigated with the robo-lector platform.

verification of results in shake flasks
to verify the results from the previous experiments, a cultivation in shake flasks was conducted under different phosphate-limited  and -unlimited conditions . the induction conditions were the same as in the robo-lector test with induction after  <dig> h, as this was the optimal time identified previously . after  <dig> h, samples from the different flasks were taken and the od, scattered light and ecfbfp fluorescence was measured offline. furthermore, samples were taken for sds-page and subsequent densitometric analysis. the results of these experiments were summarized in figure  <dig> 

the od and scattered light intensity decreased with decreasing phosphate content of the medium . on the other hand, the ecfbfp fluorescence increased with decreasing phosphate, confirming the concept of increased product formation via a phosphate limitation in batch cultures . this was also indicated by the calculated specific productivity , as this rose from  <dig>  to  <dig>  a.u. under phosphate-limited conditions. the percentage of the ecfbfp band per total protein content of the e.coli cells , as determined with sds-page and densitometry, confirmed this finding .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, different online-monitoring tools, such as ramos and biolector, were used to study, characterize and optimize the given t <dig> expression system e.coli bl <dig> prhothi-2-ecfbfp. with these tools, the demand of the examined strain for phosphate as well as the time of the limitation onset could easily be determined. furthermore, the effect of phosphate limitation on target protein production and the optimal time for induction was efficiently investigated by the automated high-throughput cultivation platform robo-lector. lastly, the results were sucessfully verified by shake flask experiments.

these results revealed, that the phosphate limitation was suitable to redirect the available resources during cultivation  to protein expression rather than in biomass production. this effect finally led to an increase in specific productivity of the target protein ecfbfp from 21% to 31% of total protein. to our knowledge, such an effect was for the first time shown for an iptg-inducible expression system. this is attributed to the fact that cells can be metabolically active for a long time even under a phosphate limitation and the resulting stationary phase  <cit> . this principle was verified with ramos cultivations shown in figure  <dig>  han and lee also showed by proteome analysis that a subset of proteins involved in protein synthesis in e. coli was greatly enlarged during a phosphate limitation  <cit> . this, in turn, could increase protein synthesis capacity. additionaly, a higher plasmid copy number was observed in a non-induced fed-batch culture because of a phosphate limitation  <cit> . this might lead to higher amounts of mrna for the target protein and consequently to a higher product yield in induced cultures. furthermore, the aspects described here are most probably also the main reason why host/vector systems using the phosphate starvation-inducible promoter phoa show high productivities, as they tend to be very efficient expression systems  <cit> .

increasing the specific productivity by phosphate limitation can be especially important in high-throughput cultivations such as mtp-based processes. since in mtps the cultivation volume is mostly fixed and the biomass often can not be increased due to oxygen limitations, the only way to increase the total productivity is to raise the specific productivity  <cit> . a promising idea would also be to combine the presented online-monitoring tools with 'omics'-techniques to further investigate the described effects of phosphate limitation, as the exact molecular reasons for the increased specific productivity remain unclear. this could help to find new targets to further enhance the production capacity of recombinant e.coli-strains.
