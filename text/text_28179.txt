BACKGROUND
the inner ear controls the ion composition of its luminal fluid, endolymph, through a multiplicity of transepithelial transport mechanisms in different cell types bounding the lumen. the high-k+, low na+, low ca2+ endolymph composition is needed for proper auditory and vestibular function  <cit> . k+ secretion by both strial marginal cells and vestibular dark cells is stimulated by β-adrenergic receptors via cytosolic camp as second messenger  <cit> . secretion of the primary anion, cl-, is known to also be under adrenergic control in semicircular canal duct  epithelium  <cit> .

cl- transport by several epithelia has been shown to be under control of a camp signal pathway that is mediated by apical cftr cl- channels via protein kinase a   <cit> . vectorial transport in those epithelia depends also on basolateral na+-k+-atpase and k+ channels as well as basolateral cl transporters such as the na+-k+-2cl- cotransporter   <cit> . cellular camp levels and camp-mediated processes, including ion transport, depend on camp metabolism regulated by the enzymatic activity of anabolic adenylyl cyclase and catabolic phosphodiesterase  <cit> .

glucocorticoids can modify cellular responses via genomic and non-genomic pathways, including regulation of ion transport processes  <cit> . na+ absorption by sccd has already been demonstrated to be stimulated by glucocorticoids  <cit> . there is considerable evidence in various tissues, including epithelia, that glucocorticoids have long-term  effects on camp metabolism and potentiate camp-mediated responses, including ion transport by activation of the glucocorticoid receptor  <cit> .

we therefore sought to determine in sccd a) whether there is a basal constitutive adenylyl cyclase activity driving camp-mediated cl- secretion, b) whether cl- secretion is enhanced by glucocorticoid hormones via activation of glucocorticoid receptors, c) whether cl- secretion is mediated through pka action and d) whether cl- secretion is mediated by a basolateral nkcc and/or kcc and an apical cftr cl- channel. our findings establish that the sccd is a site in the inner ear for pka-mediated cl- transport, that this transport depends on nkcc <dig> and another cl- uptake process , that apical cftr is likely involved and that it is enhanced by glucocorticoid-receptor activation.

RESULTS
adenylyl cyclase activator, camp analogs, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors stimulate isc
the sccd epithelium actively contributes to endolymph homeostasis by cl- secretion under control of β2-adrenergic receptors via a camp pathway  <cit> , like other epithelia that are known to secrete cl- upon stimulation by β-adrenergic receptor activation  <cit> . forskolin   <cit>  , cell permeable camp analogs  , the non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine  , and the camp-specific phosphodiesterase- <dig>  inhibitor ro-20- <dig>   increased isc in the presence of apical amiloride , an inhibitor of the epithelial na+ channel. the maximal forskolin-stimulated isc was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μa/cm <dig>  . in the present series of experiments , amiloride produced no significant changes in isc in the absence of steroids, although in a previous larger series of experiments there was a small  but significant decrease in isc <cit> . the initial transepithelial resistance  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kΩ-cm <dig>  and decreased significantly with  <dig> μm forskolin to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kΩ-cm <dig> .

the lipid-soluble drugs forskolin, 8-pcpt-camp, ro-20- <dig>  3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine , were added to both the apical and basolateral baths. amiloride was added to only the apical side and bumetanide to the basolateral side. amiloride had no significant effect on isc, whereas subsequent addition of both forskolin  and 8-br-camp  increased isc in a concentration dependent manner with an ec <dig> of about  <dig>  μm and  <dig> μm respectively. forskolin showed no additional effect after prior stimulation by either 8-pcpt-camp   or by ro-20- <dig>  , demonstrating constitutive activity of adenylyl cyclase in sccd epithelium.

glucocorticoids increase forskolin-stimulated isc
we investigated whether forskolin-stimulated cl- secretion was altered by glucocorticoid treatment . as in the absence of dexamethasone, increasing intracellular camp in dexamethasone-treated epithelia by exposure to 8-pcpt-camp in the presence of amiloride  led to an increased isc . similar responses were seen with forskolin , 8-br-camp  and ibmx  . the glucocorticoid-stimulated na+ absorption via apical sodium channels  was blocked by amiloride, which decreased isc by  <dig> – 92%  <cit> ; the remaining current was due to cl- secretion  <cit> .

the concentration-dependence of natural and synthetic glucocorticoids was determined . interestingly, the stimulation by forskolin was significantly greater after treatment with  <dig> or  <dig> nm dexamethasone, as observed previously with single concentrations of dexamethasone and forskolin  <cit> . similarly, the stimulation of isc by forskolin was significantly greater after  <dig> hr treatment with the other glucocorticoids  and the mineralocorticoid aldosterone in the continued presence of amiloride . the transepithelial resistance was significantly reduced by about one third after exposure to effective concentrations of glucocorticoids , as would be expected after insertion of a conductive pathway  in the apical membrane.

the natural and synthetic glucocorticoids stimulated within their respective physiologic and therapeutic ranges  <cit> , while aldosterone was only effective at concentrations much higher than found under normal physiologic conditions  <cit> .

glucocorticoids increase forskolin-stimulated isc by activation of glucocorticoid receptor
we investigated whether dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and aldosterone increased fsk-stimulated isc by activation of glucocorticoid receptors and/or mineralocorticoid receptors. sccd epithelia were incubated in the presence of dexamethasone , hydrocortisone  or aldosterone  alone or in the presence of receptor antagonists. mifepristone significantly reduced the effects of dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and aldosterone , consistent with action of all of these corticosteroids at the glucocorticoid receptor. mifepristone is also known to be an antagonist of the progesterone receptor; however, progesterone  had no effect on forskolin stimulation . the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone had no significant effect on dexamethasone-, hydrocortisone- or aldosterone-treated epithelia , consistent with a lack of involvement of mineralocorticoid receptor in the increase of the fsk-stimulated isc in these cells. these findings suggest that corticosteroids increase forskolin-stimulated isc  solely by activation of glucocorticoid receptors in sccd epithelia.

pka activator stimulates isc
it is known that camp-dependent cl- secretion in many epithelia is mostly mediated through activation of protein kinase a   <cit> . we therefore investigated whether pka activation increases isc in sccd. indeed, apical and basolateral addition of pka activator n6-bnz-camp stimulated isc at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm after prior inhibition of na+ transport with apical amiloride  .

blockers of basolateral na+-k+-2cl- and k+-cl- cotransporters inhibit forskolin and/or forskolin + ibmx-stimulated isc
we have previously shown that both ba2+-sensitive k+ channels and ouabain-sensitive na+-k+-atpase are involved in cl- secretion by sccd  <cit> . however, the participation of na+-k+-2cl- and k+-cl- cotransporters is not known. therefore, we investigated whether these transport proteins are involved in camp-mediated cl- secretion. untreated and dexamethasone -treated sccd epithelia were stimulated with apical and basolateral forskolin and forskolin + ibmx respectively, followed by application of blockers of ion transporters to the basolateral side. na+-k+-2cl- cotransporter inhibitor bumetanide  partially decreased the magnitude of forskolin  + ibmx -stimulated isc . bumetanide  also decreased the forskolin -stimulated isc by  <dig> ± 2%  and  <dig> ± 5%  . similarly, the k+-cl- cotransporter blocker alkanoic acid  partially inhibited the forskolin + ibmx-stimulated isc . interestingly, dioa and bumetanide, when added to the bath cumulatively, completely inhibited all of the forskolin + ibmx-stimulation, returning isc to the level observed with amiloride . these findings are consistent with the presence of na+-k+-2cl- and k+-cl- cotransporters at the basolateral membrane and their participation in cl- secretion by sccd epithelium, although dioa is lipophilic and could cross to a kcc on the apical membrane. however, the observed effect is not likely a result of action of dioa on an apical kcc since transport of cl- by an apical kcc would also result in a similar rate of k+ secretion, and no transepithelial k+  flux was detected from camp-stimulated sccd  <cit> .

expression of kcc and wnk isoforms
additive inhibition of isc by bumetanide and dioa suggested dependence of electrogenic cl- transport in sccd on expression of nkcc and kcc. the basolateral isoform of nkcc, , was shown to be present in a gene array of sccd and the apical isoform  was absent  <cit> . not all isoforms of kcc were identified on the gene chips; we tested for expression of transcripts with rt-pcr and observed expression of kcc <dig>  kcc3a, kcc3b and kcc4; but, kcc <dig> was absent .

bt, below threshold fluorescence at end of  <dig> thermocycles. ct values are based on duplicate runs of  <dig> samples sccd and duplicates of control tissue total rna. the difference between ct values of duplicates varied by  <dig>  ±  <dig>   with a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

it is known that genetic mutations in the kinase wnk <dig> and wnk <dig> cause a disease featuring hypertension and hyperkalemia and the etiology appears to be related to regulation of nkcc and kcc . we observed that sccd expresses wnk <dig> but only very low or absent wnk <dig> .

ct, average. bt, below threshold fluorescence at end of  <dig> thermocycles. ct values are based on duplicate runs of  <dig> samples sccd and duplicates of rat kidney as a control tissue. the difference between ct values of duplicates varied by  <dig>  ±  <dig>   with a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

blockers of apical cl- transport inhibit forskolin and/or forskolin + ibmx-stimulated isc
cl- secretion across the apical membrane in many epithelia is mediated by the cftr cl- channel  <cit> . na+ currents were blocked by amiloride  in dexamethasone -treated sccd epithelia. isc was then stimulated with apical and basolateral forskolin  + ibmx , followed by apical addition of blockers of cl- transporters. non-selective cl- channel inhibitors dpc  and flufenamic acid   partially inhibited the stimulated isc. the cftr cl- channel blocker cftrinh- <dig>   <cit>  partially inhibited the forskolin  and forskolin  + ibmx -stimulated isc in both the absence and presence of dexamethasone . taken together, these results suggest that cftr cl- channels are functionally expressed at the apical membrane and account for at least part of the cl- secretion by sccd epithelium, although cftr appears to not be essential for vestibular function under normative conditions . the observation of the presence of mrna transcripts of cftr in gene arrays of rat primary cultures  is consistent with that interpretation.

sccd from cftr+/− mice showed an increase in response of isc to a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol  and a mixture of forskolin and ibmx . heterozygous cftr mice are known to have an ion transport profile similar to wild-type mice  <cit> . a mixture of dioa  and bumetanide  completely inhibited the increased isc by forskolin + ibmx . this result is consistent with the results shown above in rat sccd primary cultures . on the other hand, sccd from cftr−/− mice lacked response to both isoproterenol  and a mixture of forskolin and ibmx, suggesting that all of the camp-stimulated isc is mediated by, or dependent on, cftr in mouse sccd . the vestibular functional phenotype, as assessed by rota-rod, of the cftr−/− mice did not differ significantly from the cftr+/− mice , in spite of the profound difference in stimulated isc .

discussion
sensory transduction of acceleration in the vestibular labyrinth is mediated by modulation of k+ currents through sensory cells, where the k+ originates from the high- luminal fluid. secretion of k+ is controlled by β-adrenergic stimulation   <cit>  and it is to be expected that secretion of the primary anion would also be regulated by the same agonists. movements of anions would be expected to be transcellular since the paracellular pathway must be extremely tight in this epithelium to support the large ion concentration gradients. cl- secretion by the semicircular canal duct  in the vestibular labyrinth is stimulated by camp as second messenger  <cit>  and similar mechanisms have been proposed in the cochlea  <cit> , although the cell types responsible in the cochlea have not yet been unambiguously determined .

the sccd is an epithelial domain that has a high ratio of surface area to endolymph volume and would therefore be a strong candidate for a site of effective ion homeostasis. indeed, it was recently shown that these cells also absorb na+ via the epithelial sodium channel  under glucocorticoid receptor control  <cit>  and absorb ca2+ via an epithelial ca2+ channel  <cit> , in addition to their role in cl- secretion.

we determined in the present study that camp acts via pka, whose target may be an apical cftr cl channel  <cit> . evidence supporting the involvement of cftr include inhibition of cl- secretion  by the poorly-specific inhibitors flufenamic acid and dpc and by the specific inhibitor cftrinh- <dig>  partial inhibition in rsccd by cftrinh- <dig> is consistent with reports of significant but only partial inhibition in avian proximal tubule at  <dig> μm  <cit> . in addition, mrna message for cftr was found to be present in the rat primary cultures of sccd . the observation of camp-stimulated isc in mouse canals extends the findings in gerbil and rat  <cit>  to another rodent species. the absence of camp-stimulated isc in cftr knockout mice is consistent with an essential role of cftr in canal cl- secretion, although there is no strict proof ruling out the unlikely occurrence of dissection damage to only the knockout mouse canals.

interestingly, there is no correlation of deafness in persons with dysfunctional cftr   <cit>  and no reports of vertigo in this population. our results with vestibular tests of cftr knockout mice are consistent with that observation. it may be, however, that this anion transport system is not by itself essential for normal inner ear function, but may be necessary in times of systemic stress when β-adrenergic agonist levels are elevated, but this proposition remains to be tested.

the results here demonstrated increased isc by stimulation of the camp signal pathway in several ways: through increased camp production , addition of exogenous camp analogs , and inhibition of camp catabolism . the action of all of these agents has been well-documented in other cells  <cit> . increased cl- secretion by inhibition of phosphodiesterase implies that the adenylyl cyclase is constitutively active in the sccd epithelium in the absence of β-adrenergic agonists, and is therefore consistent with the earlier observation of constitutive low-level cl- secretion  <cit> . stimulation of cl- secretion has been reported in mouse jejunum, guinea pig distal colon, t <dig> monolayers and human colonic epithelial cells by phosphodiesterase inhibition  <cit> . of particular interest is the finding that phosphodiesterase inhibition did not elevate cl- secretion in the absence of exogenous stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in t <dig> epithelial monolayers  <cit> . this is in contradistinction to our observations in rat semicircular canal primary cultures .

the responsiveness of adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase to multiple physiological challenges is related to the presence of multiple families of isoforms with tissue-specific localization  <cit> . ten isoforms of adenylyl cyclase  have been identified in mammalian cells  <cit> . in sccd, the non-selective adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, which is known to activate all identified adenylyl cyclase isoforms with varying sensitivity  <cit> , stimulated cl- secretion. gene array results showed expression of transcripts for ac <dig> and ac <dig> in sccd among the genes that were tested  using affymetrix rat genome  <dig>  <dig>  array chips  <cit> . however, it is not known whether other isoforms that were not represented on the gene array are expressed in sccd.

eleven families of phosphodiesterases  have been identified in mammalian cells, with each family having several isoforms  <cit> . phosphodiesterases show three types of substrate specificity  <cit> . the pde <dig>  pde <dig>  and pde <dig> families hydrolyze camp specifically. pde <dig>  pde <dig>  and pde <dig> are cgmp specific and pde <dig>  pde <dig>  pde <dig>  pde <dig>  and pde <dig> are dual substrate phosphodiesterases i.e. they hydrolyze both camp and cgmp. in sccd, both the non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor ibmx and the selective pde <dig> inhibitor ro-20- <dig>  <cit>  stimulated cl- secretion. gene array results showed expression of the transcripts for pde <dig> and pde <dig> isoforms but not pde <dig> in sccd  <cit> . expression of pde <dig> at the transcript level is consistent with ro-20- <dig> stimulation of isc.

glucocorticoids are known to affect camp metabolism and potentiate camp-mediated responses, including salt and water transport by activation of the glucocorticoid receptor  <cit> . it is known that glucocorticoids stimulate anion transport, including cl- in mammalian ileal mucosa, by increasing the concentration of cyclic nucleotides  <cit> . glucocorticoids elevate cellular camp levels by regulating the activity of both adenylyl cyclases and phosphodiesterases, predominantly by suppressing the activity of phosphodiesterases  <cit> . it is not known if glucocorticoids increase camp-mediated cl- secretion in sccd epithelium by a similar mechanism.

glucocorticoids increase camp-mediated cl- secretion in sccd epithelium by activation of exclusively the glucocorticoid receptor. however, the exact mechanism of potentiation of camp response is not known. the stimulation of camp-mediated isc could not have been a result of the increase in glucocorticoid-activated enac function  <cit> , since increased na+ conductance would depolarize the cell, which in turn would reduce the outward driving force for cl- across the apical membrane, in contrast to observations. in addition, na+ absorption was blocked by amiloride in these experiments. another putative mechanism of action of glucocorticoids in sccd is regulation of nkcc expression, as observed in vascular smooth muscle and trabecular meshwork cells  <cit> . however, there was no change in expression of nkcc <dig> in sccd after incubation with  <dig> nm dexamethasone for  <dig> h  <cit> . the molecular mechanism for glucocorticoid-increased camp-mediated cl- secretion in sccd epithelium has not yet been resolved.

one pathway of corticosteroid action is via the kinases sgk <dig> and wnk <dig>  <cit>  among other kinases involved in regulation of ion transport such as spak and osr <dig>  <cit> . our gene array of rat sccd cultures  <cit>  showed spak or stk <dig> to be present  and minimally down-regulated  <dig> -fold by dexamethasone. there were no probe sets identified on the chips for osr <dig>  wnk <dig> is downstream from sgk <dig> and is implicated in the control of both nkcc and kcc transporters and thereby their roles in cl- transport  <cit> . the expression of wnk <dig> in the sccd may therefore be involved in the regulation of cl- secretion in sccd through these two transporters. the transcript expression for wnk <dig> was nearly absent.

complete additive inhibition of the camp-stimulated isc by bumetanide and dioa is consistent with the participation of both na+-k+-2cl- and k+-cl- cotransporter in cl- cotransport. the concentration of bumetanide used fully inhibits nkcc <dig> but has no effect on kcc <dig> and kcc <dig>  <cit> . similarly, dioa is a potent well-established kcc transport inhibitor  that is without effect on nkcc  <cit>  and has been used as a specific kcc inhibitor in the range  <dig> –  <dig> μm  <cit> . however, dioa has also been observed in several epithelia to have diverse effects  <cit> .

the canonical interpretation that the effect of dioa is a result of inhibition of a kcc, however, is problematic. foremost, the kcc would be operating “backwards” from its most-commonly observed mode and if this were indeed the case it would necessitate an extremely low intracellular . a low intracellular concentration of the secreted ion species  would not favor a strong efflux across the apical membrane. although most cells operate kcc transporters as cellular efflux pathways, payne calculates that some neuronal cells have sufficiently-low intracellular  to thermodynamically drive influx of kcl  <cit> . the membrane potential, intracellular  and  of sccd epithelial cells is not known, so it is not possible at this time to evaluate whether these cells are able to support concurrent basolateral kcc electroneutral influx and apical electrogenic cl- secretion. the discussion by payne  <cit>  shows that at the normal extracellular  of about  <dig> mm, the intracellular  would need to be about  <dig> mm or less; a highly unlikely constellation. an elevation of extracellular  at the canal epithelium due to hair cell stimulation is also highly unlikely since the hair cells are located remotely from the canals and excess k+ would be removed from perilymph by vestibular dark cells recycling the k+ back into the lumen.

the observation that basolateral bumetanide causes only a partial inhibition of camp-stimulated cl- secretion at  <dig> μm suggests the existence of a parallel cl- uptake mechanism. block of the remaining secretion by dioa points to a kcc, subject to the caveats given above. an alternative explanation is that dioa is not a specific inhibitor for kcc in sccd and either blocks another cl- uptake mechanism that operates under thermodynamically-favorable conditions or acts broadly on active transport through inhibition of metabolic processes. this last suggestion has been observed with another lipid-soluble weak acid, the cl- channel blocker nppb, restricting its use to < <dig> μm  <cit> . in addition, dioa has been shown to interfere with atp recovery after metabolic insult and to release cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria at the concentration used here  <cit> . nonetheless, if this is the basis for action of dioa in the semicircular canal epithelium, the metabolic interference is not complete  and the likely involvement of a parallel cl- uptake pathway in rat canal remains.

in summary, our results are consistent with the following cell transport model of regulated cl- secretion by sccd . a basolateral na+-k+-atpase removes na+ from the cell and brings in k+, which is energized by atp. the resulting na+ concentration gradient drives the basolateral influx of k+ and cl- along with the recirculating na+ ions via the bumetanide-sensitive nkcc <dig>  cl- would be secreted across the apical membrane through cl- channels that may include cftr as a channel or transport modulator. the rate of secretion is controlled by glucocorticoids and β2-adrenergic signalling via camp and pka.

CONCLUSIONS
the rat semicircular canal duct epithelium expresses three major ion transport systems, including a β2-adrenergic receptor-stimulated cl- secretion  <cit> . we have demonstrated here that cl- secretion is under control of a pka-mediated signal pathway that depends on basolateral cl- uptake via nkcc and  transporters and that it is enhanced by activation of glucocorticoid receptors. interestingly, nkcc does not appear to contribute to enac-mediated na+ absorption  <cit>  in the same cells. the role of the β2-adrenergic receptor/camp pathway in inner ear function remains unknown but is likely activated under stress.
