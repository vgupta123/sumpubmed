BACKGROUND
frontotemporal lobar degeneration  is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia after alzheimer's disease   <cit> . ftld patients are clinically characterized by personality changes and disinhibited behaviour, often combined with a gradual and progressive language dysfunction  <cit> . memory impairment is typically preserved in the early phase of disease, which distinguishes them from patients with ad. pathologically, around 40% of ftld patients present with neuronal and/or glial tau aggregates , whereas the majority of ftld patients show ubiquitin-immunoreactive cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions historically referred to as ftld-u   <cit> . more recently, it was shown that hyperphosphorylated and c-terminal truncated fragments of the nuclear protein tar dna-binding protein  <dig>  were the main component of the pathological inclusions in ftld-u, and the term ftld-tdp was introduced  <cit> . three main patterns of tdp- <dig> pathology are recognized in ftld-tdp, based on the anatomical distribution, morphology, and relative proportion of distinct types of inclusions  <cit> . in this study, we will follow the nomenclature based on the mackenzie scheme  <cit>  where ftld-tdp type  <dig> is characterized by tdp- <dig> positive compact neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and short neurites, ftld-tdp type  <dig> presents with long tdp- <dig> positive neurites and ftld-tdp type  <dig> is characterized by compact and granular cytoplasmic inclusions.

in the past decade, several different genes and chromosomal loci have been associated with ftld. mutations in the microtubule associated protein tau  gene were first identified as a cause of familial ftld-tau  <cit> . more recently, our group and others discovered that heterozygous mutations in the progranulin gene  cause ftld-tdp through a loss of function mechanism  <cit> . patients with pgrn mutations maintain only a single functional copy of the gene, leading to the loss of 50% of functional pgrn, causing disease through haploinsufficiency. the reduced level of pgrn, a growth factor with a key role in a variety of cellular responses, provokes neurodegeneration and associated symptomatology in ftld patients, including deficits in behaviour, language, and movement  <cit> . interestingly, all patients with pgrn mutations present with ftld-tdp pathology type  <dig>  <cit> ; however, ftld-tdp type  <dig> is also observed in a subset of ftld-tdp patients without pgrn mutations. although there are clear pathologic distinctions in ftld-tdp, the molecular pathways which underlie its progression are still mostly undefined. recent advances in our understanding of the mammalian genomes, however, have revealed novel regulatory mechanisms with critical roles in disease pathogenesis, thus offering new avenues to explore.

the recent discovery of pervasive expression for noncoding rnas  in our genomes through extensive 'transcriptomic' efforts  <cit>  has significantly enhanced our fundamental knowledge of cellular signaling cascades and will likely reshape future drug discovery efforts. indeed, pgrn mutation carriers diagnosed with ftld exhibit a range of pathologic and phenotypic outcomes, suggesting that other contributing factors, such as ncrnas, mediate disease progression  <cit> .

the mirna class of ncrna, in particular, has generated a lot of interest as their widespread role in many cellular functions becomes increasingly apparent  <cit> . one mirna can control the expression of hundreds of downstream gene targets, underscoring the importance of characterizing their functional roles in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . over the last few years, a growing number of publications have reported dysregulation of mirna expression in numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, such as alzheimer's disease and huntington's disease  <cit> . recent reports have also examined mirna regulation of pgrn, suggesting that this gene is under the control of ncrnas, including mir- <dig>  and mir-29b  <cit> . furthermore, our group previously showed a functional disruption of a mir- <dig> binding site in ftld patients with a common genetic variant of pgrn   <cit> .

here we profiled mirna expression in the frontal cortex of a population of ftld-tdp patients with pgrn mutations and compared their mirna expression pattern with a large group of ftld-tdp patients without pgrn mutations, with the goal to identify mirnas responsive to pgrn haploinsufficiency. for those mirnas showing greatest evidence of dysregulation and that were validated technically by quantitative real-time pcr in frontal cortex, we further examined their expression in the cerebellum, with the expectation that pgrn levels are globally disrupted throughout the cns. finally, we developed a unique list of gene targets predicted to be regulated by mirnas dysregulated in both frontal cortex and cerebellum in our patient samples, based on previously reported microarray mrna data as well as bioinformatic mirna target prediction sites.

RESULTS
mirna array results from frontal cortex
using the abi v <dig>  arrays, we profiled the expression of  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> ftld-tdp patients, including  <dig> pgrn- ftld-tdp and  <dig> pgrn+ ftld-tdp patients . there was detectable expression for  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas present on the array, and those candidate mirnas were subjected to further analysis. we identified the  <dig> mirnas which showed greatest evidence of differential expression  between the pgrn+ and pgrn- ftld-tdp groups . none of these were statistically significant after accounting for multiple testing  and the smallest q-value was  <dig> , however we still pursued these  <dig> top-ranking mirnas as the most promising candidates. ten out of the  <dig> mirnas had higher expression in the pgrn+ ftld-tdp group , while the other  <dig> mirnas had lower expression in this group . all mirna array results and statistical analyses are listed in additional file  <dig>  graphical display of the  <dig> significantly changed mirnas showed a consistent mirna expression pattern in all three pgrn- ftld-tdp subtypes  compared to pgrn+ ftld-tdp .

mirna validation from frontal cortex
to perform technical validation of the mirna array results, we evaluated the expression of the  <dig> significantly dysregulated mirnas between the pgrn+ and pgrn- ftld-tdp patients by qrt-pcr. one mirna, mir- <dig>  was undetectable using the individual mirna assays from abi. of the remaining  <dig> detectable mirnas, nine could be confirmed by qrt-pcr as significantly altered between the pgrn+ and pgrn- ftld-tdp groups with p <  <dig> . the validated mirnas were mir- <dig>  mir-33a*, let7i*, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-548b-5p, mir-548c-5p and mir-516a-3p .

mirna validation from cerebellum
we hypothesized that the mirnas dysregulated in the frontal cortex of the pgrn+ ftld-tdp patients could also be differentially expressed in other brain areas as haploinsufficiency of pgrn function would not be region-specific. we therefore selected the  <dig> frontal cortex validated mirnas with the largest estimated fold change and profiled their expression in the cerebellum of  <dig> pgrn+ ftld-tdp and  <dig> pgrn- ftld-tdp patients . five of the  <dig> mirnas , were significantly altered with p <  <dig>  in the cerebellum .

mirna expression in vitro
to further study the relationship between the loss of pgrn and the top five dysregulated mirnas identified in frontal cortex and cerebellum, we performed a preliminary in vitro study in human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells. in cells treated with pgrn sirna we detected a 60% decrease in pgrn mrna levels compared to negative control sirna treated cells; however, no difference in mirna expression for mir-516a-3p, mir-548b-5p and mir-548c-5p was observed . expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> was too low  and could not be included in the analysis.

targetscan analysis and ingenuity pathway analysis of mirna targets
the overall role of mirnas is to repress mrna and protein expression  <cit> . to facilitate the identification of mrna targets for the  <dig> pgrn+ ftld-tdp associated mirnas, we made use of publicly available affymetrix mrna arrays performed in ftld-tdp patients with and without pgrn mutations   <cit> . since all  <dig> mirnas were upregulated in frontal cortex and cerebellum of pgrn mutation carriers, we focused on mrna targets which were downregulated in both frontal cortex and cerebellum of pgrn mutations carriers in the affymetrix mrna arrays. a total of  <dig> probesets showed significant downregulated expression in both the cortex and cerebellum of the pgrn+ ftld-tdp patients . when compared with the list of targetscan predicted genes for each of the  <dig> pgrn+ ftld-tdp associated mirnas,  <dig> genes with anti-correlated mrna-mirna expression were identified . among the  <dig> genes, brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor  <dig> , glycerol kinase  and solute carrier family  <dig>  member  <dig>  were targeted by  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas upregulated in the cortex and cerebellum of the pgrn+ ftld-tdp patients. seven genes were targeted by  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas, and  <dig> genes were targeted by  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas .

list of top scoring genes predicted to be regulated by the  <dig> significantly upregulated mirnas  from the  <dig> mrnas significantly downregulated in frontal cortex and cerebellum in pgrn+ compared to pgrn- ftld-tdp patients .

next, for the  <dig> genes we found in common between the targetscan and affymetrix results, we examined their potential biological roles with ingenuity pathway analysis. interestingly, neurological and cellular regulations were the most prominently represented biological roles of the significant pathways identified . in fact,  <dig> of the genes , protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, d , potassium voltage-gated channel, shaker-related subfamily, beta member  <dig> , cannabinoid receptor  <dig> , alpha-synuclein , and neural cell adhesion molecule  <dig> ) were shown to have a specific role in behavioural responses, a phenotype which is consistently altered in ftld .

discussion
identifying the molecular events leading to pathogenic outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases, such as ftld, may ultimately produce new avenues for prevention or treatment of these disorders. in this study, we report a novel role for ncrnas in the molecular profile of ftld patients with genetic mutations in the secreted growth factor pgrn. the mirna family of ncrnas showed distinct expression patterns in post-mortem brain tissue of ftld-tdp patients carrying loss-of function mutations in pgrn compared to ftld-tdp patients without known mutations, suggesting that mirnas are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for genetically-linked dementia disorders.

since the initial reports linking pgrn mutations to ftld  <cit> , the search for pgrn mediated signaling cascades has intensified, such as the recently reported associations with sortilin   <cit> . through the comparison of ncrna expression profiles from patients with genetic versus non-genetic  diagnosis of ftld-tdp, we aimed to identify new pathways which are under the control of pgrn signaling in vivo. indeed, in frontal cortex samples of ftld-tdp patients, the expression of 3% of the detectable mirnas from the expression arrays was significantly changed when pgrn+ and pgrn- ftld-tdp patients were compared. moreover, the dysregulated mirnas showed consistent trends in all three of the pgrn- ftld-tdp subtypes  compared to pgrn+ ftld-tdp patients, suggesting the mirna candidates we identified are unique to pgrn haploinsufficiency. in further support that the mirnas dysregulated in our array and validation studies are under the control of systemic pgrn-mediated mechanisms, we found that  <dig> mirnas  were also upregulated in the cerebellum of pgrn+ ftld-tdp compared to pgrn- ftld-tdp patients.

to further study the five candidate mirnas, we silenced pgrn expression in sh-sy5y cells; however, none of the  <dig> mirnas detectable in sy-sy5y cells displayed a significant difference in expression between control and pgrn-silenced cells. this finding suggests that long-term knockdown of pgrn may be necessary, consistent with the late onset of symptoms in human ftld patients.

the mechanism by which pgrn haploinsufficiency in ftld patients leads to altered mirna expression is currently unclear and requires future studies. progranulin downstream signalling involves erk1/ <dig> and akt signalling and these are potential causes of altered mirna expression. it is unlikely that the five mirnas identified in this study are dysregulated as a result of tdp- <dig> aggregation since the ftld-tdp type  <dig> pathology in the pgrn mutation carriers is indistinguishable from the pathology observed in sporadic ftld-tdp patients.

it is now known that mirnas can modulate mrna stability and translation  <cit> , therefore, we correlated publicly available mrna expression results from sporadic  ftld-tdp and pgrn+ ftld-tdp patients with bioinformatic mirna target predictions  for the  <dig> mirnas upregulated in the frontal cortex and cerebellum  <cit> . through this analysis, we identified  <dig> predicted gene targets with significantly downregulated mrna expression profiles in pgrn+ ftld-tdp patients. the anti-correlated expression of the upregulated mirnas with their downregulated mrna targets in pgrn+ patients parallels the established mirna-mrna regulatory relationship. notably, ingenuity pathway analysis of the  <dig> genes revealed that they have important links to biological functions involved in ftld disease pathogenesis, including nervous system development, behavioural responses, and cell growth. indeed, astn <dig> is known to regulate neuronal migration in cortical regions of developing brain  <cit> , snca is associated with neurodegeneration and dementias, including links to ftld-tdp in pgrn+ patients  <cit>  and reep <dig> has been implicated in corticospinal neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . importantly, only  <dig> genes are predicted to be targeted by  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas significantly dysregulated in both frontal cortex and cerebellum, including bai <dig>  a cell adhesion g protein coupled receptor. this finding is of significant interest since bolliger et al. recently reported that c1q-like proteins can act as secreted signalling molecules that bind to bai <dig> leading to the regulation of synapse formation and maintenance. in support of their finding, both c1ql and bai <dig> are highly and specifically expressed in brain and are enriched in neurons  <cit> . based on these findings our current data suggest that the loss of pgrn may increase the expression of mir- <dig>  mir-548b-5p and mir-548c-5p through unknown mechanisms, leading to a decrease in the levels of bai <dig>  an essential protein for synapse biology.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our studies support a novel role for mirnas in ftld-tdp due to pgrn dysfunction and emphasize the value of combined mirna and mrna analyses. future experiments in cell and animal models are needed to further evaluate the clinical potential of the mirnas and gene targets identified in this study. the recent progress in human trials for mirna-based therapeutics in non-cns related disorders  <cit>  offers hope for new alternatives for the treatment of dementias, including ftld.
