BACKGROUND
several prevalent diseases such as cancer, exudative  age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis are associated with abnormal angiogenesis, i.e., formation of pathological neovasculature. it is believed that targeting pathological neovasculature is a better strategy for cancer therapy than targeting tumour cells  <cit> . in the case of cancer, there are two methods for targeting pathological neovasculature in tumours, namely anti-angiogenesis by anti-angiogenic inhibitors  <cit>  and anti-neovasculature by vascular disrupting agents  <cit> . because pathological neovasculature usually has formed by the time a diagnosis is reached, eradication of the pathological neovasculature is necessary to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy. among those vascular disrupting agents there are several molecules called vascular targeting agents  <cit> . these vascular targeting agents were designed to bring soluble tissue factor  to tumour endothelial cells by targeting mhc class ii, cell adhesion molecules, fibronectin, or prostate specific membrane antigen, and then to cause the shutdown of the blood vessels of tumours by initiating blood clotting. the vascular targeting agents are expected to show the greatest therapeutic benefit for anti-neovasculature treatment as part of combined modality regimens  <cit> .

the anti-pathological neovasculature protocol that garen and hu developed  <cit>  is different from anti-angiogenic inhibitors and those tf-containing vascular targeting agents. our protocol is based on a chimeric antibody-like molecule, named icon, composed of two mature coagulation factor vii  peptides, the natural ligand for receptor tissue factor , fused to the fc domain of a human igg <dig> antibody by recombinant dna technology. tf, a normal cell surface receptor  <cit> , is expressed on tumour vascular endothelial cells  <cit> , which can be induced by tumour cell-produced vegf and other growth factors  <cit> , but not on normal vascular endothelial cells  <cit> . although tf is expressed on extravascular cells of several normal tissues and in the adventitial layer of the blood vessel wall, it is sequestered by fvii at these sites by the tight endothelial cell layer of the normal vasculature  <cit> . in addition, tf is over-expressed on many types of solid cancer cells  <cit> . thus, tf provides a common but specific target in tumour neovasculature and tumour cells for development of novel cancer therapies and diagnostic protocols.

the icon protein can specifically target both tumour cells and tumour vascular endothelial cells via binding tf for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer. the icon molecule is designed to bind to tf with far higher affinity and specificity than can be achieved with an anti-tf antibody. icon has several important advantages as compared to an anti-tf monoclonal antibody. the kd for fvii binding to tf is up to 10- <dig> m  <cit> , in contrast to anti-tf antibodies that have a kd in the range of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> m for tf  <cit> . icon is produced by recombinant dna technology, allowing mouse icon  to be made and tested in animal models of diseases and human icon  to be made from human sources for future clinical trials without the need of the humanisation process that is required for monoclonal antibodies. tests of icon immunotherapy in mouse models of primary and metastatic tumours have demonstrated that primary and distant metastatic tumours can be eradicated without causing obvious toxicity  <cit> . in addition, icon was efficacious and safe for the eradication of choroidal neovascularisation in mouse and pig models simulating wet-form macular degeneration  <cit>  and for eradication of the neovasculature in human endometriosis in a mouse model  <cit> .

recently we showed that peripheral blood lymphocytes could induce icon-dependent cytotoxicity to human endometrial cancer cells in vitro  <cit> . however, the underlying killing mechanisms of icon immunotherapy remain to be further defined. the objective of this study is to define these mechanisms of icon immunotherapy for cancer in vitro and in vivo using a squamous carcinoma human tongue cancer line tca <dig>  <cit> . because icon is an antibody-like molecule, presumably natural killer  cells and complement should be separately involved in the killing actions through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity  and complement dependent cytotoxicity  pathways. nk cells are highly specialised lymphoid cells involved in adcc against tumour or virally infected cells. here, we test icon-mediated adcc and cdc effects on human tongue cancer in vitro and in vivo in two genetically modified scid mouse strains  <cit> , namely scid/cb- <dig> and scid/beige. the scid/cb- <dig> strain has functional nk cells but lack mature b- and t-lymphocytes  <cit> , whereas the scid/beige strain not only lacks b-and t-lymphocytes but also has defective nk cells  <cit> . therefore, nk cell-mediated adcc is only active in the cb- <dig> strain, whereas both mouse strains have complement proteins that could mediate cdc. this paper reports for the first time that icon as an antibody-like immunoconjugate containing human igg <dig> fc can initiate nk cell-mediated adcc for killing human cancer cells in vitro and that nk cell level/activity is crucial for the efficacy of icon immunotherapy of human cancer in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
the mouse icon protein can be produced by icon producer cho cells and adenoviral vector-infected tumour cells and can bind to human tongue cancer cells
as shown in sds-page , the molecular weight of mouse icon  produced by icon producer cho cells was  <dig> kda under non-reducing conditions, and  <dig> kda under reducing conditions with β-mercaptoethanol. these results suggested that icon is a homodimeric molecule composed of two identical single peptides, each with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda. flow cytometry analysis showed that the icon protein could bind to human tongue cancer cells .

icon was also detected by western-blotting in a serum-free culture medium of human tongue cancer tca <dig> cells after infection with an adenoviral vector encoding gfp and icon , but not in the medium of the cells infected with a control vector adblank . this result provides a link for understanding the in vitro efficacy using icon protein and the in vivo efficacy using icon vector, as reported below.

nk cells mediate icon-adcc on human tongue cancer cells
the nk cells used in adcc assays were isolated from murine splenocytes of scid/cb- <dig> mice using a rat monoclonal anti-mouse nk cell dx <dig> antibody. dx <dig> antibody can bind to mouse nk cells without strain limitation  <cit> . before isolation, pan nk positive cells were  <dig> % in splenocytes using a dx5-pe conjugate as determined by flow cytometry . after isolation, the nk percentage increased to  <dig> % . these purified nk cells were used for icon-adcc below.

using the calcein-am dye release assay, murine splenic nk cells in the presence of mouse icon protein  killed 18% and 70% of human tongue cancer cells at effector:target  ratios of 1: <dig> and 10: <dig> respectively  . note that the direct effect of nk cytotoxicity in the absence of icon protein was subtracted from these percentages of specific lysis. thus, the results suggested that mouse nk cells could mediate mouse icon, which contains a human igg <dig> fc as effector domain, for specific lysis of cancer cells through adcc mechanism.

icon-cdc is less effective at killing human tongue cancer cells than icon-adcc mediated by nk cells
we showed that the icon-mediated cdc effect was dependent upon the concentration of icon protein  . however, mouse icon-mediated cdc killed only about 33% specific lysis of the cancer cells at  <dig> μg/ml and 25% at  <dig> μg/ml of icon protein , which was less than that of icon-nk cell adcc  . we conclude that icon-nk adcc mediates a stronger killing effect than icon-cdc for tca <dig> cancer cells.

icon protein has no direct effect on cancer cell proliferation in the absence of nk cells and complement
we showed that icon protein at various concentrations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/ml, which was higher than those in the adcc and cdc experiments, did not have any effects on the proliferation of tca <dig> cancer cells . thus we conclude that icon has no direct inhibitory effect on tf expressing cancer cell proliferation in the absence of immune cells and complement. in another word, the killing effect observed in the adcc and cdc assays above was achieved by icon in combination with nk  or complement  but not by icon alone .

nk cells are also the major players in vivo for icon immunotherapy of human tongue cancer in scid mice
to test the role of nk cells in icon immunotherapy in vivo, the efficacy of icon immunotherapy for human tongue cancer was compared between the scid/cb- <dig>  and scid/beige  mouse strains.

in scid/cb-17mice , tca <dig> tumours in the control group  grew rapidly and the mice had to be euthanised on day  <dig> . in contrast, tumour volume in the icon treated mice  decreased to 87% by day  <dig> after the first injection of icon vector and tumours were completely eradicated in  <dig> of  <dig> icon-treated mice separately on day  <dig> and day  <dig>  these mice were then tumour free for the rest of experimental period  . the other two icon-treated mice also initially responded to icon treatment and their tumours became necrotic, observed as ulcerations on the tumours on day  <dig>  even though the tumour size was small . tumour ulceration was not observed in any control tumours even when the tumours reached much larger volumes , suggesting that tumour ulceration, which occurred in all  <dig> treated mice, was a sign of the therapeutic effect of icon treatment and not due to spontaneous tumour necrosis. however, tumours in the  <dig> partially responsive mice still grew from the surrounding tumour margins on day  <dig> after the first series of injections. a second series of injection with icon vector was completed in these two mice. further icon treatment caused bigger ulceration but still did not eradicate tumours. nevertheless, icon-treated tumour weights were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g  on day  <dig>  which were significantly smaller than those of control tumours on day  <dig> .

in beige mice , tumour growth in the icon-treated mice  was inhibited by icon therapy as compared to the control tumours  . but by day  <dig>  tumours reached about  <dig> mm <dig>  a similar size to the control tumours on day  <dig>  the control mice had to be euthanised on day  <dig> and the icon-treated mice on day  <dig>  there was no significant difference in tumour weights between control tumours  and icon-treated  tumours . tumour ulceration was not observed in any of control beige mice but was observed in one of  <dig> icon-treated beige mice on day  <dig> 

the results in these two scid strains indicated that icon could completely eradicate human tongue tumours in the cb <dig> strain that had functional nk cells, but did not achieve the same effect in the beige strain that did not have functional nk cells, suggesting that nk cell activity is crucial and responsible for icon to completely eradicate the established tumours. assay for nk cell percentage in the icon-treated mice below further indicated that not only the functional nk cells but also the nk cell percentage in peripheral blood lymphocytes  is crucial for icon to completely eradiate tumour in host mice. taking these in vivo and in vitro results together, we conclude that nk cell is the major player, as compared to complement, in the icon immunotherapy for complete eradication of cancer.

all scid mice were examined morphologically at the end of the experiments. in cb- <dig> mice, enlarged spleens were observed in all control mice and  <dig> icon-treated pr mice. the spleens were normal in the icon-treated cr mice. none of the cb- <dig> mice had metastatic tumours. in beige mice, enlarged spleens were observed in  <dig> of  <dig> control mice and  <dig> of  <dig> of the icon-treated mice. one control beige mouse had one metastatic nodule  in the lung and one icon-treated beige mouse had  <dig> metastatic nodules  in the lungs. there were no other abnormalities observed in the scid mice.

nk cells can prevent tumour formation and their percentages in pbl are closely correlated with the efficacy of icon-mediated immunotherapy in scid mice
using flow cytometry with an nk cell specific antibody dx5-fitc conjugate, we analysed the nk cell percentages in pbl from normal scid/cb- <dig> and scid/beige mouse strains. in female scid/cb- <dig> mice, the nk percentage in pbl was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at 4-weeks old  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at 9- <dig> weeks old  with an average of 16% at age of 4- <dig> weeks old . in female scid/beige mice, the nk percentage was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at  <dig> weeks old  , indicating that nk cells are present in peripheral blood of the beige mouse strain. however, it is notable that nk function was depressed by beige gene mutation  <cit> .

to establish tumours for experiments in figure 4a and 4b,  <dig> scid/cb- <dig> mice and  <dig> scid/beige mice were separately injected s.c. with the same number  of human tongue cancer tca <dig> cells. within one month, all of  <dig> scid/beige mice evenly developed tumours with an average of  <dig> mm <dig>  however, it took  <dig> months for  <dig> of the  <dig> cb-17/scid mice to develop tumours with similar volume to the scid/beige mice. additionally, in this strain, another  <dig> had tumours larger than those observed in the scid/beige mice  and the last  <dig> cb-17/scid mice never developed tumours. similarly, in an unpublished experiment there were another  <dig> scid/cb- <dig> mice,  <dig> of which developed skin tumours early. the tumour size also varied in these scid/cb- <dig> mice. the difference in tumour growth between the cb- <dig> and beige scid strains suggest that functional nk cells in the cb- <dig> strain played a role in rejecting or delaying tongue cancer formation.

to understand the variations in icon efficacy between the cr and pr scid/cb- <dig> mice , the nk percentages in peripheral blood lymphocytes  were monitored by flow cytometry  <dig> days before and at the time of euthanisation. the icon-treated cr mouse had a normal nk cell percentage at  <dig> % at  <dig> days before enthanisation, whereas the nk level was  <dig> % in a normal scid/cb- <dig> mouse of the same age. however, the nk level in the icon-treated pr mouse was  <dig> % at  <dig> days before euthanisation and further significantly decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at the time of euthanisation. at the same time, the cr mouse had  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of nk in pbl , suggesting that an impaired nk level could contribute to the faster tumour growth in  <dig> of the cb-17/scid mice above and to the resistance to icon immunotherapy observed in these pr mice .

discussion
we have previously shown that icon immunotherapy was efficacious for selective eradication of pathological neovasculature for the treatment of several types of cancer  <cit> , wet macular degeneration  <cit>  and endometriosis  <cit> . but its mechanism of action was previously unclear. in this paper, we elucidate the mechanisms of action of icon immunotherapy for cancer in vitro and in vivo. we show that  both adcc and cdc are involved in mechanisms of action of icon immunotherapy, but nk cells play a more important role than complement in mediating antibody-like icon immunoconjugate to kill cancer cells; and  the activity and level of nk cells are crucial for icon to completely eradicate cancer in mice. we have also ruled out the possibility that icon has any direct effects on killing or inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. we understand that the role of complement in mediating icon immunotherapy can be further elucidated in complement-deficient mice. however, so far these complement-deficient mouse strains are derived from immunocompetent mice, for example, c3-/-c4-/- was from c57bl/ <dig> background  <cit> , in which human tumours cannot be generated. therefore, further tests for the role of complement in icon immunotherapy will be completed using mouse tumour cell lines in future studies.

nk cells played at least two distinct roles in this study, the first being to prevent tumour development after inoculation of tongue cancer cells by non-specific killing and the other to mediate adcc by icon-guided specific killing after icon immunotherapy is initiated. the first role of nk cells was observed as the difference of tumour formation/volume between cb- <dig> and beige strains. previous reports also showed that nk cells could mediate adcc for other therapeutic antibodies including trastuzumab  for breast cancer  <cit> , rituximab  for b-cell lymphoma  <cit> , and cetuximab for lung cancer  <cit> .

it has been observed that nk cell percentage/activity can be impaired by tumours in animals and cancer patients. in  <dig>  herberman rg et al. summarised in a review article  <cit>  that nk activity had been found to be impaired in tumour-bearing mice and patients that had large tumour loads. in later years, more reports showed that the adcc activity of nk cells was impaired in patients with cancer, including breast  <cit> , gastric  <cit> , esophageal  <cit> , and urologic cancers  <cit>  as well as leukemia  <cit>  and myeloma  <cit> . in addition, nk activity can decline with age  <cit> , which may contribute to higher incidence of cancer developed in elderly populations. with regard to the role of nk cells in icon immunotherapy for tongue cancer, we observed in this study that icon immunotherapy was able to completely eradicate tumours in scid/cb- <dig> mice that had functional and normal levels of nk cells but not in the beige mice that did not have functional nk cells. icon was also unable to completely eradicate tumours in some of the pr cb- <dig> mice in which nk cell percentages were lower than the normal level .

considering the previous observations regarding impaired nk cell activity in cancer patients and in mice, as reviewed above, with our observations in this study, we hypothesize that decreased/depressed nk cell level/activity can contribute to resistance to icon and other antibody immunotherapies for cancer. resistance to antibody immunotherapy has been observed in preclinical studies and clinical trials. for example, the rate of primary resistance to single agent her2-targeted trastuzumab immunotherapy was 66% to 88% of patients with metastatic breast cancer that overexpressed the her <dig> antigen  <cit> . varchetta et al. analysed circulating mononuclear cells in  <dig> breast cancer patients after treatment of her <dig> targeted-trastuzumab therapy and found that nk cells and cd56+ t cells were involved in trastuzumab treatment and concluded "quantity and lytic efficiency of cd16+ lymphocytes  are major factors for adcc induction by trastuzumab"  <cit> .

if decreased nk cell level/activity is detected in host , icon immunotherapy should be combined with nk cell infusions and/or nk-activating cytokines. infusions of autologous or allorgeneic nk cells for cancer therapy have been shown feasible and well-torelated in cancer patients  <cit> . we will test if infusion of nk cells could amplify the icon efficacy in future preclinical and clinical studies. in addition, efforts are being made in our laboratory in generating immortalized nk cell lines. if successful, these nk cell lines could be used for adcc assays in vitro and potentially for immunotherapy in vivo in combination with icon or other therapeutic antibodies.

previous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that cytokines such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and interferon can enhance the effect of antibody-adcc for immunotherapy of cancer, e.g., il- <dig> and il- <dig> enhanced nk cell response to herceptin-coated her2/neu+ breast cancer cells in vitro  <cit> . using an adenoviral vector encoding mouse il- <dig> in combination with admicon vector, we indeed observed that the efficacy of icon immunotherapy was significantly enhanced by mil- <dig> for the treatment of human tongue cancer in scid/cb- <dig> mice and murine breast cancer in balb/c mice .

in this regard, monitoring the nk level in pbl is important for interpreting the efficacy of icon and other antibody immunotherapy. in this paper, we use a simple flow cytometry procedure for this purpose, in which a commercial anti-pan nk dx <dig> antibody fitc or pe conjugate is first incubated with a small volume  of blood samples containing anti-coagulant such as heparin or citrate sodium followed by lysis of rbc and then cell sorting using flow cytometry. this procedure can be easily adapted for clinical trials using anti-human nk antibody fluorescent dye conjugates. we recommend that nk level/activity should be monitored and tested as a standard operation protocol in cancer patients before and during the treatment with antibody immunotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this paper reports for the first time the efficacy and the mechanism of action of the novel, dual neovasculature- and cancer cell-targeting fvii/fc icon immunotherapy for human tongue cancer in vitro and in vivo. the importance of nk cell level/activity for the underlying mechanism of icon immunotherapy could also be true in the animal models of age-related macular degeneration and endometriosis, in which icon immunotherapy was effective in eradicating the pathological neovasculature  <cit> . in addition, our observations on the importance of nk cells can also have implications for other immunotherapeutic antibodies that are currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical studies.
