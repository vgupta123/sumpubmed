BACKGROUND
powdery mildew , caused by ascomycete fungi of the order erysiphales, is one of the most well-known plant diseases  <cit> . pm fungi are able to cause disease on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits of nearly  <dig>  different angiosperm plant species, including various economically important plants, such as cucumber . pm in cucumber can be caused by two different species, golovinomyces orontii and podosphaera xanthii. in greenhouses and open field cultivation in warm regions, p. xanthii appears to be the most occurring agent of pm in cucurbits, whereas g. orontii is the major pm species on cucurbits grown in the open field in colder regions  <cit> .

according to the gene-for-gene concept, plants have dominantly inherited resistance genes , encoding r proteins which recognize the products of corresponding avirulence genes  of pathogens, triggering defence responses  <cit> . even though this can give a strong, complete resistance, the pathogen can mutate, lose or silence the recognized avr gene to break the resistance, leading to a new virulent race of the pathogen, often within a few years after the commercial introduction of a new r gene. the cloning of r genes in several plant species has led to the finding that they typically encode receptor proteins of various classes with leucine-rich repeat  domains  <cit> . an exception to r-gene mediated resistance was discovered in x-ray irradiated summer barley populations in the 1940’s  <cit> . a recessively inherited monogenic resistance was observed, which was active against all known isolates of barley pm . later, other alleles at the same genetic locus were obtained in various barley genotypes, including a naturally occurring mutant allele that was found in resistant ethiopian barley landraces  <cit> . the durability of this so-called mlo  resistance is exemplified by the fact that cultivars with this type of resistance have been extensively cultivated since the 1980s without new races of the pathogen breaking the resistance  <cit> . by positional cloning, the causal gene for mlo based resistance was isolated  <cit> . it was found to encode a plasma membrane-anchored protein with seven transmembrane helices, reminiscent of animal g-protein-coupled receptors  <cit> .

after the barley mlo gene was cloned, it was found that mutations in homologs of this gene in other plant species can also lead to recessively inherited resistance to different pm causing fungi. in the model species arabidopsis thaliana t-dna insertion mutations in three mlo homologs contribute to pm resistance, although a mutation in one of the three genes  has a larger effect compared to mutations in the other two genes . the effect of loss of function of atmlo <dig> or atmlo <dig> is only additive in atmlo <dig> background, but not detectable when atmlo <dig> is intact  <cit> . in several crop species, i.e. tomato  <cit> , pea  <cit> , cucumber  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> , recessively inherited pm resistance with similar characteristics compared to barley mlo resistance was indeed found to be caused by naturally occurring mutations in mlo homologs. in other species, e.g. pepper, wheat, apple and grapevine, knockdown of mlo homologs by virus induced gene silencing  or rna interference  led to pm resistance . this indicates that mlo-based resistance is very common in plants, rather than a particular oddity occurring in barley. it has been shown that mlo-based resistance depends on the formation of cell wall depositions  by the plant cell directly beneath pm penetration attempts  <cit> . the molecular basis of mlo-based resistance is however yet poorly understood, although it has been shown that it depends on the function of several molecular components, such as the bax-inhibitor protein  which plays a role in control of programmed cell death  <cit> ; on an intact actin cytoskeleton  <cit>  and on the t-snare proteins pen <dig>  and ror <dig>  involved in targeted exocytosis  <cit> .

since the year  <dig>  when the first plant genome sequence was published, i.e. that of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , an increasing number of plant genomes has been sequenced. in all available sequenced plant genomes mlo homologs occur as medium sized gene families with seven to thirty-nine mlo genes per plant species  <cit> . in phylogenetic analyses of the mlo gene family, it has been found that mlo genes can be divided into seven phylogenetic clades, although not all plant species harbour representatives of all clades  <cit> . the mosses, representing the most basal lineages of land plants, have mlo homologs only one of the clades, i.e. clade i. in other lineages of plants, especially in angiosperm species, the mlo gene family has diversified. however, several plant species apparently lost genes in some of the mlo clades during evolution, such as the monocotyledonous family of the poaceae which has no mlo homologs in clades v and vi, or several dicotyledonous species such as arabidopsis thaliana and tomato which have lost clade iv mlo homologs, even though a basal angiosperm species, amborella trichopoda, has homologs of clade i to vi  <cit> .

not all the mlo genes found so far have been characterised as being required for susceptibility towards pm fungi. for most mlo genes mutant phenotypes have not been described yet, although there are examples of clade i mlo mutants with a defect in root formation  <cit>  and of clade iii mlo mutants with defects in pollen tube perception  <cit>  and pollen hydration  <cit> . so far, all mlo genes involved in pm susceptibility  have been found to group either in clade iv  or clade v . it has been shown that heterologous overexpression of the barley clade iv mlo gene can functionally complement loss of function mutations in clade v mlo genes in tomato  <cit> , exemplifying that although there are significant differences in amino acid sequence between clade iv and v mlo proteins, they are functionally conserved.

in cucumber, the genome sequence of which was published in  <dig>  <cit> , thirteen mlo homologs have previously been identified. of these thirteen homologs, three genes were found to group phylogenetically in clade v. these three genes, named csamlo <dig>  csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig>  should therefore be considered as potential pm s-genes in cucumber  <cit> . in other cucurbit crops, i.e. melon , watermelon  and pumpkin , similar numbers of clade v mlo genes have been identified, although pumpkin has four rather than three clade v mlo genes  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis reveals that the last common ancestor of these cucurbit crops already had at least three clade v mlo genes.

of the three cucumber clade v mlo genes, csamlo <dig> has previously been proven to be a susceptibility gene for pm caused by p. xanthii. from cucumber genotypes with recessively inherited pm resistance a natural csamlo <dig> mutant allele was cloned  <cit> . while heterologous overexpression of the wild-type csamlo <dig> was able to functionally complement mlo loss-of-function mutants in both tomato  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , the mutant allele failed to restore susceptibility. the mutation in csamlo <dig> has been caused by the integration of a retrotransposable element in the coding sequence of the gene  <cit> . this mutant allele was found to occur frequently in cultivated cucumber germplasm  <cit> , and additionally two other csamlo <dig> loss-of-function mutations have been found in resistant genotypes due to either a frameshift indel leading to an early stop codon, or a snp in an intron-exon junction causing aberrant splicing of the pre-mrna  <cit> .

in a review of co-localization of cucumber mlo genes with qtls for pm resistance, schouten et al.  <cit>  mentioned that two previously described qtls for pm resistance co-localized with the other two cucumber clade v mlo genes, csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig>  fukino et al.  <cit>  performed qtl analysis in a ril population derived from a cross between the pm resistant genotype cs-pmr <dig>  and the moderately susceptible genotype santou, a native japanese cultivar. of the nine detected qtls for pm resistance, one qtl  co-localized with csamlo <dig>  whereas another qtl  co-localized with csamlo <dig>  the resistance associated with pm <dig>  was contributed by the allele from cs-pmr <dig>  while the santou allele contributed to resistance at the pm <dig>  locus.

here we report the functional characterization of two cucumber clade v mlo genes, csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig>  we show that heterologous overexpression of either of the genes in a tomato mlo mutant led to restoration of susceptibility to pm. furthermore, we investigated the transcription profile of the three cucumber clade v mlo genes in various tissues, both prior to and after inoculation with the pm causing fungus p. xanthii. also, we screened a set of  <dig> resequenced cucumber accessions in silico for potential loss of function mutations in either of the clade v mlo genes, and resequenced two additional cucumber genotypes with reported pm resistance qtls in regions containing either csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> 

RESULTS
functional analysis of cucumber clade v mlo genes by complementation of a tomato mlo mutant
we amplified the clade v mlo genes csamlo <dig>  and csamlo <dig>  from cdna of a cucumber inbred line. pcr products were of the expected sizes  and sequences were identical to the reference genome of the pm susceptible genotype ‘chinese long 9930’  <cit> . to test whether these genes are susceptibility genes, csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> were overexpressed in a tomato mlo mutant, which is resistant to pm due to a mutation in the slmlo <dig> gene  <cit> . it was expected that if csamlo <dig> and/or csamlo <dig> are susceptibility genes, overexpression in the tomato mlo mutant would lead to restoration of susceptibility to pm. after transformation, cuttings from eight  or seven  individual transformants were obtained and inoculated with oidium neolycopersici, the causal agent of pm in tomato. sporulation was observed on five of the eight csamlo <dig> transformants and on two of the seven csamlo <dig> transformants .table  <dig> cuttings of five out of eight csamlo <dig> transformants and two out of seven csamlo <dig> transformants were found to be susceptible to oidium neolycopersici

the tomato slmlo <dig> mutant, with a frameshift deletion in the slmlo <dig> gene  <cit> , was transformed with either a 35s::csamlo <dig> construct or a 35s::csamlo <dig> construct. csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> expression in each of the primary transformants  was quantified relatively to housekeeping gene slef-α using qrt-pcr. two cuttings per individual transformant were inoculated with oidium neolycopersici, the causal agent of powdery mildew  in tomato. disease phenotypes were scored based on whether or not pm symptoms were visible on the leaves at 10 days post inoculation




in order to confirm the ability of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> to restore pm susceptibility, primary transformants were self-pollinated to obtain t <dig> families. t <dig> families were obtained from two individual transformants per gene. additionally, two t <dig> families were obtained from previously described csamlo <dig>  overexpressing transformants  <cit> . from each t <dig> family,  <dig> to  <dig> plants were sown. plants were screened by pcr for the presence of the overexpression construct. it was found that the t <dig> populations obtained from the csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> transformants segregated for the presence of the transgene in ratios close to 3: <dig>  suggesting one transgene insertion site per individual primary transformant. the t <dig> populations obtained from  the csamlo <dig> transformants showed skewed segregation patterns with either one out of  <dig>  or one out of  <dig>  individuals not having the transgene, suggesting multiple inserts per individual transformant.

t <dig> families were inoculated with o. neolycopersici and pm symptoms were scored based on a 0– <dig> scale, with  <dig> being completely free of pm symptoms and  <dig> being fully infected. the non-transformed slmlo <dig> mutant did not show any pm symptoms , whereas in the susceptible control  75% of the plants scored the maximum disease index of  <dig>  and 25% of the plants scored a disease index of  <dig> . an overall analysis showed significant differences between the groups . stepdown post hoc analysis revealed that overexpression of csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> restored susceptibility completely, leading to a susceptibility level not significantly different from moneymaker . however, overexpression of csamlo <dig> restored susceptibility only partially, giving disease indices between  <dig> and  <dig>  which is significantly higher than the resistant control slmlo <dig>  but significantly lower than the susceptible control moneymaker .fig.  <dig> complementation of a tomato mlo mutant with either csamlo <dig>  csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig>  the tomato mlo mutant, with a frameshift deletion in the slmlo <dig> gene  <cit> , was transformed with either a 35s::csamlo <dig> construct, a 35s::csamlo <dig> construct or a 35s::csamlo <dig> construct . two individual transformants per transgene were self-pollinated to obtain t <dig> populations. t <dig> plants were screened for the presence of the overexpression construct. plants carrying an overexpression construct were inoculated with o. neolycopersici. a representative individuals from t <dig> families expressing either csamlo <dig>  csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> in the tomato mlo mutant, showing powdery mildew  symptoms. non-transformed tomato slmlo <dig> mutant  and cv. moneymaker  are shown as controls. b disease indices were scored visually on a scale from  <dig>  to  <dig> , as described in  <cit> . t <dig> families consisted of  <dig> to  <dig> individuals positive for the presence of the overexpression construct. resistant and susceptible controls consisted of  <dig> individuals. bars represent percentages of plants within each disease index class. different letters above bars indicate significant differences between populations 




per family, five plants  were randomly chosen to measure the expression of the transgene using qrt-pcr . it was found that the transgene expression in both csamlo <dig> t <dig> families was significantly higher than in the csamlo <dig> t2-a family and both of the csamlo <dig> t <dig> families , whereas there was no significant difference in transgene expression between csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> t <dig> families . the csamlo <dig> t2-b family did not have a significantly different transgene expression compared to either of the other t <dig> families . transgene expression was not detectable in  susceptible moneymaker or resistant mlo control plants.

transcript abundance profiling of cucumber clade v mlo genes
the relative transcript abundance of the cucumber clade v mlo genes csamlo <dig>  csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> was determined in three different tissues  of the susceptible cucumber cultivar sheila, using qrt-pcr. it was found that in each of the three tissues the transcript abundance of csamlo <dig> was several orders of magnitude higher than that of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> , a difference which was found to be statistically significant . to confirm this, we re-examined a previously obtained dataset consisting of rna-seq data obtained from a variety of cucumber tissues from the reference cultivar ‘chinese long 9930’. this showed that in all examined aerial tissues  csamlo <dig> was higher expressed  compared to either csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig>  although in stem tissue csamlo <dig> also appeared to be rather highly expressed. for the aerial tissues for which data on more than one biological replicate was available , the observed difference in expression was found to be statistically significantly . in root and root tip tissue however, both csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> were highly expressed, whereas csamlo <dig> was lowly expressed , although this difference was not found to be statistically significant . for comparison we also examined the expression of the a. thaliana clade v mlo genes  in a publicly available rna-seq dataset of a. thaliana tissues  <cit> . we found that atmlo <dig> expression was much higher than atmlo <dig> or atmlo <dig> expression in all four sampled tissues , although the difference in roots was smaller than in the other tissues .fig.  <dig> expression profile of clade v cucumber mlo genes in different tissues. a the relative transcript abundances of csamlo <dig>  csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> in three tissues of the pm-susceptible cucumber cultivar ‘sheila’  were determined using qrt-pcr. data were normalized, using the geometric average of the ct values of reference genes ef-α and tip <dig>  relative transcript abundances were calculated as 2-dct. each bar shows the average transcript abundance of five to eight biological replicates on a logarithmic scale. the number of independent biological replicates per gene/tissue combination is given in the respective bars. error bars indicate standard error of the mean. different letters above bars indicate significant differences between genes . b the transcript abundances in seven tissues of cucumber  were determined using rna-seq. the fpkm values  for csamlo <dig>  csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> in each of these tissues are shown on a logarithmic scale. the amount of independent biological replicates per tissue was either one , two  or three . if applicable, error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. different letters above bars indicate significant differences between genes  or dunnet t <dig>  post hoc tests, p <  <dig> )




subsequently we investigated the expression profile in cucumber tissues inoculated with p. xanthii. samples were taken of cucumber hypocotyl, cotyledon and leaf tissue prior to and at four, six, eight and  <dig> h post inoculation. the relative expression of csamlo <dig>  csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> in those samples was determined using qrt-pcr . we found that in leaf tissue there were significant differences in csamlo <dig> transcript abundance between time points . at four,  <dig> and  <dig> h post inoculation csamlo <dig> transcript abundance was significantly higher compared to the transcript abundance prior to inoculation . this induction of csamlo <dig> was not significant anymore at  <dig> h after inoculation . csamlo <dig> was significantly downregulated at  <dig> h post inoculation compared to the transcript abundance prior to inoculation . in cotyledon or hypocotyl tissue there were no significant differences of clade v mlo gene transcript abundance between any of the time-points .fig.  <dig> relative expression level of clade v mlo genes in different cucumber tissues in response to podosphaera xanthii inoculation. relative transcript abundances in three tissues  hypocotyl, b cotyledon and c leaf) of pm-susceptible cucumber genotype ‘sheila’ before and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h post inoculation with p. xanthii were determined using qrt-pcr. data were normalized relative to the geometric average of the ct values of reference genes ef-α and tip <dig>  and subsequently normalized relative to the average dct value at  <dig> hpi for each gene/tissue combination. relative transcript abundances were calculated as 2-ddct. each bar shows the relative expression of four to eight biological replicates on a logarithmic scale. error bars indicate standard error of the mean. different letters above bars indicate significant differences between time points 




as these results were in conflict with the finding in  <cit>  that csamlo <dig> transcription was upregulated upon pm inoculation, the experiment was repeated independently, with samples of cucumber hypocotyl and leaf tissue prior to and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post inoculation. the relative expression of csamlo <dig> in those samples was determined using qrt-pcr . no significant differences in csamlo <dig> transcript abundance were observed in any of the time points compared to the transcript abundance prior to inoculation .

screening of sequenced cucumber germplasm for potential csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> mutants
we anticipated that if csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> are susceptibility genes towards pm in cucumber, loss-of-function mutations in those genes, leading to resistance, would have been selected for in cucumber germplasm. as qi et al. published resequencing data of a collection of  <dig> divergent cucumber genotypes  <cit> , we decided to screen these data for potential loss-of-function mutations in either csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig>  complete lists of detected snps and indels in the  <dig> lines were downloaded from the cucurbit genomics database  <cit> , and filtered for the chromosomal locations of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig>  additional files  <dig> and  <dig> give an overview of all the detected snps and indels in csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> regions, respectively. the lists of snps/indels were manually curated to obtain variants in coding regions of the genes, with an effect on the predicted amino acid sequence. for csamlo <dig> we observed no snps or indels with an effect on the predicted protein. for csamlo <dig> three snps  were found with an effect on the predicted amino acid sequence . the first substitution  was in an amino acid residue conserved to be either a valine, an isoleucine or a leucine in other clade v mlo proteins with a proven function as susceptibility gene . the other two detected substitutions  were in non-conserved regions.table  <dig> non-synonymous snps detected in the csamlo <dig> coding sequence of  <dig> resequenced cucumber accessions




resequencing of cucumber genotypes cs-pmr <dig> and santou to find potential csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> mutants
as it was mentioned that two previously reported qtls for pm resistance co-localize with the genomic positions of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig>  <cit> , we hypothesized that the sources of these resistances might have mutant alleles of csamlo <dig> and/or csamlo <dig>  causal for the observed resistance. in order to test this hypothesis, we isolated dna from leaves of genotypes cs-pmr <dig> and cv. santou, the parental genotypes used for the qtl analysis  <cit> , and performed whole genome sequencing . we aligned the obtained reads to the reference genome  and identified snps and small indels in the genomic regions of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> . in the genomic region of csamlo <dig> we identified  <dig> snps and indels in cs-pmr <dig> and four snps and indels in santou, but none of these had an effect on the predicted encoded protein. similarly we identified  <dig> snps and indels in the genomic region of csamlo <dig> in cs-pmr <dig>  neither of which had an effect on the predicted encoded protein. the csamlo <dig> sequence of santou was found to be identical to that of the reference genome.

in addition to calling snps and indels we identified two regions in genotype cs-pmr <dig>  in intron  <dig> of csamlo <dig> and intron  <dig> of csamlo <dig> respectively, where we observed a local low read coverage combined with flanking read pairs with insert sizes deviating from the average or for which one of the mates in the read pair could not be mapped . as this can be indicative for larger structural variations that are harder to characterize with short read sequencing, we amplified these regions from dna of cs-pmr <dig> and sequenced the pcr products by sanger sequencing. compared to the reference genome, a 10 bp deletion and a 23 bp insertion in intron  <dig> of csamlo <dig> , and a 231 bp deletion in intron  <dig> of csamlo <dig>  were found in genotype cs-pmr <dig>  to verify whether these large indels in intron  <dig> of csamlo <dig> and intron  <dig> of csamlo <dig> have any effect on the splicing of the genes, we also amplified and sequenced the corresponding regions from cdna of cs-pmr <dig> and santou by pcr, and found that there was no observable difference in pcr product size or sequence for either csamlo <dig>  or csamlo <dig> .

as we anticipated that the resistances of genotypes santou and cs-pmr <dig> could also be caused by a difference in csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> expression rather than a difference in encoded protein sequence, we determined the relative transcript abundances of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> in leaf tissue of both genotypes by qrt-pcr, using the susceptible genotype sheila as a control . although the relative transcript abundance of both genes was found to be slightly higher in cs-pmr <dig> compared to the other two genotypes, these differences were found to be not statistically significant for either csamlo <dig>  or csamlo <dig> .

discussion
overexpression of all three cucumber clade v mlo genes restores pm susceptibility in a tomato mlo mutant
previously, it has been shown that loss of susceptibility towards pm causing fungi due to mutations in mlo genes can be restored by overexpression of functional mlo genes, both by cloning an mlo gene from a susceptible individual from the same plant species  as well as by heterologous expression of clade v mlo genes from other dicot species  <cit> , and even by heterologous expression of clade iv mlo genes from a monocot species  <cit> . this shows that even though there are considerable differences in amino acid sequence between mlo proteins, they are functionally conserved between plant species. this enabled us to study the function of cucumber clade v mlo genes by heterologous expression in the tomato slmlo <dig> mutant background. we have shown that overexpression of either of the three clade v csamlo genes restored susceptibility to o. neolycopersici, the pm causing fungus in tomato, albeit to a different extent. overexpression of either csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> resulted in full restoration of pm susceptibility towards wild-type levels. overexpression of csamlo <dig> on the other hand only partially complemented loss of slmlo <dig> function . this shows that, at least to some extent, all three genes are functionally conserved.

overexpression of csamlo <dig> appeared to be less efficient in restoring pm susceptibility compared to the other csamlo genes . although the proteins encoded by each of the three genes are not identical, they are highly similar to one another and to clade v mlo genes of other species . it appears difficult to attribute the lower efficiency of csamlo <dig> compared to the other csamlo genes in restoring pm susceptibility to a particular difference in amino acid sequence.

csamlo <dig> is the major clade v mlo gene in aerial tissues, whereas csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> are the major clade v genes in roots
susceptibility genes are defined as those genes that facilitate infection and support compatibility to plant pathogens  <cit> . within the mlo gene family, homologs from clade iv  and v  have been found to be susceptibility genes  <cit> . however, not all clade v mlo genes in all dicotyledonous plant species have been found to be s-genes. for instance, in grapevine  it was found that there are four clade v mlo genes. silencing of one of them  by transformation with rnai constructs led to gain of pm resistance, whereas silencing of two other homologs only increases resistance when vvmlo <dig> was already silenced. silencing of the fourth homolog did not contribute to resistance at all  <cit> . this unequal genetic redundancy was previously also observed in arabidopsis with one major mlo s-gene  and two minor mlo s-genes  <cit> ; and in tomato, with one major mlo s-gene , two minor mlo s-genes and one clade v mlo homolog which does not seem to play a role in pm susceptibility  <cit> .

we have shown, using qrt-pcr data  and rna-seq data , that in aerial cucumber tissues  csamlo <dig> is several folds higher expressed than the other cucumber clade v mlo genes, csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig>  this is reminiscent of the findings in tomato by zheng et al.  <cit> , who showed that the major clade v mlo gene, slmlo <dig>  is much higher expressed than the other clade v homologs in case of absence of pm. interestingly, they showed that silencing of slmlo <dig> by transformation with an rnai construct led to gain of resistance, whereas silencing of the other mlo homologs did not. indeed, a natural slmlo <dig> loss-of-function mutant had previously been characterised to be resistant to pm  <cit> , even though the other clade v mlo genes were presumably still intact. additionally, we have shown that in a publicly available arabidopsis rna-seq dataset one clade v mlo homolog, atmlo <dig>  is much higher expressed than the other clade v homologs, atmlo <dig> and atmlo <dig> . previously it has been shown that loss-of-function mutations in atmlo <dig>  but not in atmlo <dig> or atmlo <dig> lead to  resistance against pm, although double atmlo2/ <dig> or atmlo2/ <dig> and triple atmlo2/6/ <dig> mutants showed even higher levels of resistance  <cit> .

recently, researchers investigated the expression pattern of mlo genes in a large number of tissues from arabidopsis and rice, based on microarray data  <cit> . the data presented there for the arabidopsis mlo genes are in agreement with our findings , as they report that in most tissues the major mlo s-gene atmlo <dig> is much higher expressed than the other two clade v mlo genes  <cit> . rice has two clade iv mlo genes, osmlo <dig> and osmlo <dig>  <cit> , it was found that in most rice tissues osmlo <dig> transcription was much higher than osmlo <dig> transcription  <cit> . based on this finding, the authors conclude that osmlo <dig> is likely to be the major clade iv mlo in rice, rather than osmlo <dig> 

taken together, this suggests that loss-of-function mutations in the most abundantly expressed mlo gene have a large effect compared to loss-of-function mutations in the less abundantly expressed genes. this would imply that in cucumber, csamlo <dig> would be the major clade v mlo gene concerning pm susceptibility, comparable in function to e.g. slmlo <dig> in tomato and atmlo <dig> in arabidopsis. we postulate that differences in transcription efficiency between different clade v mlo genes in a species are the main reason for the observed unequal genetic redundancy, and that characterization of the relative transcript abundances of clade v mlo genes in a species may help identify the major mlo gene regarding susceptibility. to our knowledge, it has not been attempted in either arabidopsis or tomato to express the minor clade v mlo genes under a strong constitutive promoter. on the basis of our results, we would expect that overexpression of e.g. atmlo <dig> or atmlo <dig> in atmlo <dig> background would be sufficient for restoration of susceptibility, if it were to be true that transcript abundance rather than differences in amino acid sequence determine which clade v mlo gene is the major s-gene.

contrastingly, rna-seq results show that csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> are highly expressed in root tissue, whereas csamlo <dig> is not . interestingly, all three arabidopsis clade v mlo genes were also found to be highly expressed in root tissue . as pm causing fungi are foliar pathogens, which do not infect roots, the finding that several clade v mlo genes in cucumber and arabidopsis are highly expressed in roots will probably not have much consequence on the interaction of plants with pm causing fungi. however, we should note that it is likely that csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> fulfil an important, yet unknown role in cucumber roots.

loss-of-function mutations in hvmlo in barley and atmlo2/atmlo <dig> in arabidopsis lead to increased susceptibility to necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens such as leaf spot blotch disease caused by bipolaris sorokiniana  <cit> , rice blast on barley caused by magnaporthe grisea  <cit> , leaf spot disease caused by alternaria spp. and late blight caused by phytophthora infestans  <cit> . this suggests that mlo-genes can in some cases contribute to resistance to necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens, in contrast to their role as susceptibility gene for  pm causing fungi. therefore, it might be interesting to study the effect of loss-of-function mutations in the root-expressed csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> on the interaction with necrotrophic, soil-borne cucumber pathogens such as vascular wilt caused by the necrotrophic fungus fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum or root rot caused by the necrotrophic oomycete pythium spp. furthermore, as it is known that barley mlo mutants are less efficiently colonized by mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi  <cit> , it could also be interesting to see the effect of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> loss-of-function mutations on the mutualistic interaction with arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi in cucumber.

csamlo <dig> expression is induced upon pm inoculation, whereas csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> are not
for several plant species it has been shown that the expression of mlo susceptibility genes is induced upon inoculation with pm causing fungi , potentially due to the fungus actively upregulating the expression of those genes to induce susceptibility. it was previously reported based on rna-seq data of p. xanthii inoculated cucumber leaves that csamlo <dig>  but not csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> was upregulated in leaves in response to the inoculation, showing a ca.  <dig>  fold upregulation in expression  <dig> h post inoculation  <cit> . figure 3c confirms this finding, since we have found significant  upregulation of csamlo <dig> expression in leaves at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after inoculation with p. xanthii. as upregulation of mlo gene expression due to inoculation with pm causing fungi is often regarded as putative evidence for a role as susceptibility gene, one might argue that this suggests that csamlo <dig> is a functional susceptibility gene, and csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> are not. however we would like to point out that even though csamlo <dig> expression in leaves is significantly induced upon pm inoculation relative to the expression before inoculation , the expression of csamlo <dig> before inoculation is much lower than that of csamlo <dig> which is constitutively higher expressed , so consequently even after inoculation the transcript abundance of csamlo <dig> is still higher than that of csamlo <dig> 

previously we observed that inoculation of cucumber with p. xanthii led to upregulation of csamlo <dig> in hypocotyl tissue, but not in leaf or cotyledon  <cit> . to our surprise we could not reproduce this result in our experiments described here, even though using the same cucumber genotype, p. xanthii isolate, climatic conditions and inoculation protocol, and using the same qrt-pcr primers and protocol . even though we did observe a small induction of csamlo <dig> expression in hypocotyl at  <dig> and  <dig> h post inoculation, differences in csamlo <dig> transcript abundance in hypocotyl tissue between time points were far from significant . it should be noted that the variation in transcript abundances between different biological replicates is quite high, both in our experiments described here and in our previously published results. as the current experiment has a larger sample size  and was repeated with similar results , we conclude that upregulation of csamlo <dig> in hypocotyl tissue  <cit>  was probably an artefact caused by a low number of biological replicates.

we previously described that a loss-of-function mutant allele of csamlo <dig> leads to hypocotyl-specific resistance towards pm, with partial resistance in leaf tissue, and attributed this tissue specificity to the supposed tissue-specific upregulation of csamlo <dig>  <cit> . now that we have shown that csamlo <dig> is in fact not upregulated in hypocotyl tissue, we have to come up with a different explanation for the observed tissue specificity of csamlo8-based resistance. it is in this sense interesting to note that csamlo <dig> basal expression is very low  whereas it is induced upon pm inoculation in leaf tissue but not in hypocotyl tissue . assuming that both csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> are functional susceptibility genes, we can hypothesize that in a csamlo <dig> loss-of-function mutant, which expresses functional csamlo <dig>  there is hardly any expression of a functional mlo susceptibility gene in hypocotyl tissue, whereas there is induced expression of csamlo <dig> in leaf tissue, resulting in complete resistance in hypocotyl tissue and only partial resistance in leaf tissue. if this would be true, a double csamlo1/csamlo <dig> loss-of-function mutant would be expected to have complete resistance in both leaf and hypocotyl tissue.

no putative loss-of-function csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> mutants could be identified in resequenced cucumber germplasm
as loss-of-function mutations in functional susceptibility genes can lead to durable resistance  <cit> , it would be worthwhile to obtain cucumber lines with mutations in clade v mlo genes. it has previously been described that a natural mutant allele in csamlo <dig>  caused by insertion of a retrotransposable element, leads to partial resistance to p. xanthii. this mutant allele has a rather high frequency in breeding material, probably because of its beneficial effect on pm resistance  <cit> . furthermore, several other mutant alleles of csamlo <dig> were identified in resistant cucumber genotypes  <cit> . it is therefore reasonable to assume that if loss-of-function mutations in csamlo <dig> and/or csamlo <dig> would contribute to pm resistance, they also would have been selected for during cucumber breeding. therefore we decided to screen a publicly available dataset of snps and indels in a collection of  <dig> cucumber genotypes  <cit>  for putative loss-of-function alleles in the coding regions of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> . we did not find any evidence for variant alleles with a large effect on the amino acid sequence in either of the genes , although we observed three snps in csamlo <dig> leading to amino acid substitutions . of these three snps, two were predicted to cause an amino acid substitution from valine to isoleucine, two amino acid residues with very similar physiochemical properties. furthermore, those amino acid residues were in the c-terminal domain of the csamlo <dig> protein, a region which is not conserved compared to other clade v mlo proteins . a third snp was predicted to lead to a substitution of the 170th amino acid residue, a valine, into a glycine residue, at a location conserved to be either a valine, a leucine or an isoleucine in other clade v mlo proteins . as glycine and valine are both relatively small, aliphatic, non-polar amino acids, this substitution can be considered a rather conservative mutation. without further evidence it does not seem very likely that this snp represents a loss-of-function allele of csamlo <dig>  in conclusion, we did not find strong evidence in this dataset for possible loss-of-function alleles of csamlo <dig> and/or csamlo <dig>  although it should be noted that by focussing on snps and indels we could have overlooked mutant alleles that are harder to find by short-read resequencing, such as the transposable element characterised in csamlo <dig>  which can have a profound effect on the function of the genes.

in another approach to try to identify possible mutant alleles of csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> we resequenced two additional cucumber genotypes, cs-pmr <dig> and cv. santou, which were previously mentioned to have qtls for pm resistance colocalizing with the genomic positions of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig>  <cit> . although we identified several snps, indels and structural variations at the csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> loci, especially in the more pm resistant genotype cs-pmr <dig>  none of these are predicted to lead to any change in the encoded csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> proteins . in addition, we verified whether the transcript abundances of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> were different between these cucumber genotypes , but we concluded that there were no significant differences among them. therefore, we concluded that the observed resistance by fukino et al.  <cit>  is likely caused by other genes rather than csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> 

the fact that we could not find convincing loss-of-function alleles of csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> in a diverse panel of cucumber genotypes implies that loss-of-function mutations in either of these genes have apparently not been selected for in cucumber breeding. an explanation for this finding could be that csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> knockout mutations could have only a small, additive effect on pm resistance in csamlo <dig> mutant background, and not have any effect in csamlo <dig> background, comparable to the situation in arabidopsis  <cit> . furthermore it could be possible that loss-of-function mutations in csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> have pleiotropic effects on plant fitness, and are therefore selected against.

it would in our opinion be interesting to study the effect of knock-out mutants of csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig>  for instance by targeted mutation using the increasingly popular crispr-cas <dig> technology  <cit> , such as was already done in the bread wheat tamlo-a <dig> gene  <cit> . this might lead to a new, durable source of pm resistance in cucumber, especially when combined with the already existing csamlo <dig> partial resistance  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we analysed the role of cucumber clade v mlo genes in susceptibility to pm. we showed by means of heterologous overexpression of the cucumber mlo genes csamlo <dig>  csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> that all three genes are able to restore susceptibility in mlo tomato, although the effect of csamlo <dig> overexpression was weaker compared to csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> overexpression. additionally, we studied the transcription levels of these genes in different tissues of cucumber, both with and without inoculation with a pm causing fungus, p. xanthii, showing that csamlo <dig> is higher expressed compared to csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> in all aerial tissues, although csamlo <dig> expression in leaves is induced by inoculation with p. xanthii. we discuss that csamlo <dig> is therefore likely to be the major clade v mlo gene in cucumber concerning pm susceptibility, with a potential minor role for csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig>  comparable to earlier findings for mlo genes in arabidopsis and tomato. in roots, however, csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> appeared to be much higher expressed, which might have implications on the interactions of cucumber with root pathogens or beneficial microbes. no potential natural loss-of-function mutations in either csamlo <dig> or csamlo <dig> have been found so far. it would be interesting to generate csamlo <dig> and csamlo <dig> mutants, for instance by crispr-cas <dig> technology, to investigate whether such mutations have an added effect on top of pm resistance caused by csamlo <dig>
