BACKGROUND
the mammalian startle response is a protective response that results in the contraction of skeletal and facial muscles in response to a sudden acoustic, tactile or vestibular stimulus. this response is modulated by elementary forms of learning such as sensitization  <cit>  and habituation  <cit> . short-term habituation is an attenuation of the startle response upon repeated presentation of startle stimuli within one session that is reversible within several minutes  <cit> . the degree of attenuation varies between different animal species and different mouse strains  <cit> .

the startle response is mediated by a short, well-described primary pathway , which is depicted in figure  <dig>  a relatively small population of giant neurons in the pnc represents the sensorimotor interface of the startle pathway  <cit> . these neurons receive multiple sensory inputs converging from auditory, trigeminal and vestibular afferent pathways  and their axons project directly onto motoneurons that innervate the facial and skeletal muscles  <cit> . previous behavioral and pharmacological studies have indicated that the mechanism responsible for short-term habituation of the startle response must be located at the synapses within the pnc  <cit> .

we have previously shown that repeated short trains of action potentials  induce an exponential decay of the synaptic response amplitudes in pnc giant neurons in rat brain slices. this form of synaptic depression was proposed to be the neural correlate for short-term habituation of the startle response  <cit> . in the present study, we address the question whether the underlying mechanism for synaptic depression is localized at presynaptic sites belonging to the sensory branch of the startle pathway or rather at postsynaptic sites on the pnc giant neurons that directly activate motoneurons. this distinction is critical, since if synaptic depression occurs presynaptically, it would take place before multimodal integration of startle stimuli, whereas postsynaptic synaptic depression should be general for all sensory input. we performed patch-clamp recordings of pnc giant neurons in rat and mouse brain slices during stimulation of auditory and trigeminal afferent pathways. the depression induced by individual stimulation of these pathways in brain slices from rats and mice was examined for any possible interference arising from stimulation of the other pathway and the ensuing depression there. in parallel, behavioral experiments were performed with mice of the same strain used in vitro to investigate whether there is interference between short-term habituation to acoustic and tactile startle stimuli. further electrophysiological studies included analysis of the passive membrane properties of pnc neurons and of short-term plasticity before and during synaptic depression. additionally, the dynamic properties of the stimulated synapses were examined to provide more insight about the location of the synaptic depression mechanism.

RESULTS
auditory and trigeminal inputs have been shown to converge on pnc giant neurons  and both undergo homosynaptic depression when repeatedly stimulated by presynaptic bursts  <cit> . to induce synaptic depression, auditory and trigeminal afferent fibers were stimulated with  <dig> μs pulses applied by concentric extracellular electrodes placed either in the auditory stria ventral to the lateral superior olive  or medial to the ventral portion of the principal nucleus of the 5th nerve  in rat and mouse brain slices. four stimulus pulses delivered within  <dig> ms made up each burst and  <dig> bursts were applied at frequencies of either  <dig> or  <dig>  hz. the burst stimulation elicited short trains of action potentials in the afferent sensory fibers that should resemble the normal neuronal activity  in these fibers during the presentation of an acoustic or tactile startle stimulus. the acoustic stimuli used in behavioral studies are typically sudden, loud noise pulses  of about  <dig> to  <dig> ms duration and presented at frequencies between  <dig>  and  <dig>  hz.

the postsynaptic currents evoked by the single pulses within one burst summated strongly due to the large membrane time constant of giant neurons. thus, burst stimulation of sensory afferents evoked compound synaptic responses in pnc neurons  that have been shown to be mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors  <cit> . peak amplitudes of the compound postsynaptic excitatory currents  were measured with whole-cell patch clamp recordings at - <dig> mv. during a sequence of  <dig> bursts applied to sensory afferent fibers at a frequency of  <dig> hz, the cepsc peak amplitudes decreased to  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the initial response evoked when auditory fibers were stimulated  and dropped to  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the initial amplitude when trigeminal fibers were stimulated . the depression of the cepscs lasted for about  <dig> minutes before amplitudes recovered to the initial value . resting membrane potentials and input resistances of the postsynaptic neurons were analyzed during the recordings. the resting potential was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv before and - <dig> ±  <dig>  mv immediately after depression of burst responses was induced by  <dig> auditory burst stimuli at  <dig> hz . the input resistance of the recorded cells was  <dig> ±  <dig> mΩ before and  <dig> ±  <dig> mΩ during depression , as assessed by the i/o function of current responses to three small hyperpolarizing voltage pulses. this shows that the postsynaptic cell parameters were quite stable during recordings and that there were no alterations in postsynaptic membrane permeability at or near rest during depression.

interaction of auditory and trigeminal input in the pnc
if synaptic depression is due to a presynaptic mechanism located at the sensory afferent neuron terminals, synaptic depression in one sensory pathway should not affect synaptic transmission in the other pathway. we tested this hypothesis in rats and c57bl/ <dig> mice. presynaptic stimulation intensity was adjusted until similar cepsc amplitudes were elicited by stimulation in either pathway.  <dig> bursts were first applied to the trigeminal pathway and then immediately thereafter to the auditory afferent fibers. figure  <dig>  shows that repeated trigeminal stimulation in rats and mice induced an exponential decay of cepsc amplitudes . the auditory stimulation following again led to an exponential decay . in mice, we additionally reversed the order of the pathway stimulation after a  <dig> min recovery period . in summary, each  <dig> burst sequence induced a significant cepsc decay  ≥  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). moreover, there was no significant difference between the first trigeminal cepscs of sequences  <dig> and  <dig> or between the first auditory cepscs from sequences  <dig> and  <dig>  ≤  <dig> , p ≥  <dig> ), indicating that synaptic depression in one pathway inhibited neither synaptic transmission in the other pathway nor subsequent synaptic depression.

interaction of acoustic and tactile startle habituation
given that synaptic depression is the mechanism underlying behavioral short-term habituation, habituation should also be specific to the modality used to induce it. in other words, habituation to acoustic stimuli should not affect the startle response to tactile stimuli, and vice versa. we tested this hypothesis in c57/bl <dig> mice. in c57/bl <dig> mice, both the acoustic and tactile startle responses decreased significantly  ≥  <dig> , p ≤  <dig> ). however, habituation to tactile startle stimuli was much stronger than habituation to acoustic stimuli in this mouse strain. in both cases, habituation had no influence on the startle response to subsequent stimuli of a different modality. the tactile startle response was the same in the group with preceding acoustic stimulation  and the control group with no previous stimulation  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; difference of means of blocks 11–15: t =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; fig. 4). the course of the acoustic startle response was also the same whether or not tactile stimuli were presented before the acoustic stimuli  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; difference of means of blocks 11–15: t =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

in summary, the data shows that both synaptic depression and short-term habituation are pathway/modality specific. this also corroborates the hypothesis that short-term habituation of the startle response is associated with synaptic depression in the pnc.

depression of burst responses is accompanied by altered short-term plasticity
the pathway specificity of synaptic depression may indicate that a presynaptic mechanism is the underlying factor. however, a local postsynaptic mechanism restricted to the activated postsynaptic sites  could also account for pathway specificity. a feature that is commonly associated with presynaptic modulation of synaptic efficacy is an alteration of short-term plasticity. in the following experiment, we used a common paired-pulse paradigm to test whether short-term plasticity changed during synaptic depression. pairs of pulses with an interstimulus interval  of  <dig> ms were applied before  and immediately after a sequence of  <dig> bursts . the single epscs evoked by each of the pulses were clearly separated from one another . only ten traces were averaged for each condition to ensure that synapses in the "depressed" state could not recover during paired pulse measurements. there was little variability in the epsc amplitudes within one condition and the amplitude of epsc <dig> did not change during  <dig> repetitions of the paired pulse protocol  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), showing that paired pulses themselves did not induce synaptic depression. the paired pulse ratio was determined for each cell from the averaged trace. under control conditions, epsc <dig> amplitudes were always substantially larger than epsc <dig> amplitudes by a mean factor of epsc2/epsc <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . surprisingly, the mean amplitude of epscs <dig> in the depressed state directly after the application of  <dig> burst stimuli did not decrease , whereas the mean amplitude of the second epscs decreased from - <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa to - <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa, revealing a significantly reduced mean paired pulse ratio of epsc2/epsc <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  during depression  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , fig. 5c). in summary, this shows that paired pulses themselves did not induce synaptic depression and that the depression induced by  <dig> bursts was accompanied by alterations in the paired pulse ratio. moreover, responses to single pulses did not seem to be depressed after  <dig> bursts, instead the alteration in short-term plasticity as assessed by the reduced paired pulse facilitation may account for much of the attenuation of the compound epsc amplitude resulting from a burst stimulus. in other words, the above experiments indicate that the depression of cepsc amplitudes is not due to general depression of synaptic transmission, but is instead the result of alterations in short-term plasticity that specifically lead to an attenuation of responses to stimuli late within a burst. we verified this by analyzing the burst responses evoked by the  <dig> bursts in more detail. the amplitude of the first response within one burst was measured in all cells with clearly distinguishable single responses within one burst . it was found that the first responses were not as strongly depressed as the overall cepsc amplitudes. in figure 5d, the cepsc amplitudes and the amplitudes of the initial response within each burst are plotted for each pathway. in  <dig> cells the first response declined to 71% of the starting amplitude at auditory synapses but to only 81% at trigeminal synapses, whereas the overall depression of cepscs in the same cells was 61% in both pathways. moreover, depression of the first response started only after about  <dig> bursts, indicating that short-term depression within one burst increases with repeated burst stimulation and that this accounts for the majority of the attenuation of cepsc amplitudes.

multiple stimuli at high frequency are necessary to induce synaptic depression
as reported above, the application of paired pulses induced no synaptic depression but burst stimulation did. we thus examined in more detail which type of stimulus is required to induce synaptic depression. we truncated the bursts to only one, two or three pulses to see whether multiple high frequency stimuli are necessary to induce depression in the auditory pathway. application of  <dig> single or double pulses with  <dig> ms isi at  <dig> hz did not yield any synaptic depression . there was no significant difference between the amplitudes of the first and the last ten averaged epscs  =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  for single pulses; t = - <dig> ; p =  <dig>  for double pulses, fig. 6a). stimulation with  <dig> triple pulses first led to a small potentiation, followed by a significant decay of response amplitudes to  <dig> ±  <dig> %  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> , fig. 6a). to summarize, synaptic depression strongly depended on repetitive stimulation by bursts; only bursts containing three or more pulses were able to induce synaptic depression.

evidence for a presynaptic mechanism
the decrease in paired pulse ratio during depression and the need for repeated high frequency stimulation to produce depression both indicate that postsynaptic receptor desensitization may play a role in synaptic depression. if synaptic depression is indeed caused by receptor desensitization, longer intervals between bursts should decrease the amount of depression should be weaker with longer burst intervals; we therefore, we increased the interval between the bursts from one to ten seconds in another experiment.  <dig> bursts applied to auditory afferents at  <dig>  hz resulted in synaptic depression of the burst responses, reducing them to  <dig> ±  <dig> %  with a course of depression similar to that induced by  <dig> hz burst stimulation . there was no significant difference between the means of epscs 91– <dig> with stimulation at  <dig> hz and  <dig>  hz  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), which indicates that synaptic depression was independent from the burst intervals used. the degree of synaptic depression induced by different stimulus paradigms is summarized in figure 6c. although the results again indicated that synaptic depression is the result of a presynaptic process, we wanted to look for more evidence that could exclude receptor desensitization as the mechanism underlying the depression. we combined presynaptic stimulation of auditory afferent fibers with the application of exogenous glutamate to pnc giant neurons in rat brain slices; the glutamate was delivered via focal glutamate uncaging, thus circumventing the presynaptic terminal. we adjusted the amount of glutamate uncaging in such a way that glutamate-evoked currents displayed time courses comparable to presynaptically evoked cepscs . the experiment revealed two main results; first, a sequence of  <dig> applications of exogenous glutamate at  <dig> hz did not result in a decrease of glutamate-evoked current amplitude  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , fig. 7b). this indicates that repeated activation of glutamate receptors on pnc giant neurons at  <dig> hz does not lead to receptor desensitization. second, glutamate-evoked currents  in pnc giant neurons were measured before and immediately after depression was induced with a sequence of  <dig> burst stimuli applied to auditory afferent fibers. the amplitude and time course of the glutamate-evoked currents did not change during synaptic depression  = - <dig> , p =  <dig> , fig. 7c), suggesting that no glutamate receptor desensitization occured. in summary, our data provided no evidence that postsynaptic glutamate receptor desensitization is the mechanism underlying synaptic depression in the pnc.

further evidence for a presynaptic depression mechanism was provided by experiments in which β-gdp  was added to the patch pipette solution. β-gdp deactivates postsynaptic g-proteins upon diffusion into the recorded cell. the effect of β-gdp is especially interesting, since there is evidence for the involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptors  in the synaptic depression process  <cit> . the addition of β-gdp had no effect on synaptic depression in the auditory or trigeminal pathway; cepsc amplitudes elicited by auditory or trigeminal afferents significantly decreased to  <dig> ±  <dig> %  and  <dig> ±  <dig> %  of the initial amplitude  =  <dig>  p <  <dig>  for auditory and f =  <dig>  p <  <dig>  for trigeminal cepscs, fig. 8). the results show that no g-protein activation at postsynaptic sites is required for synaptic depression.

as a whole, our results provided an abundance of evidence that presynaptically-located synaptic depression in the pnc is the mechanism responsible for short-term habituation of the startle response.

discussion
in this study, auditory and trigeminal synapses in the pnc were stimulated presynaptically by applying short, high frequency bursts to afferent fibers of secondary neurons in the respective sensory pathway. we chose the burst stimulus paradigm as a model for the in vivo activity of auditory neurons during an acoustic startle experiment. primary and secondary auditory neurons have been shown to fire at high frequency during sound presentation  <cit>  and our burst duration resembles the duration of a startle stimulus. giant neurons have a slow membrane time constant, enabling them to integrate repetitive auditory inputs as well as other sensory or modulatory input arriving at the neuron at different latencies  <cit> . presynaptic bursts of action potentials produce compound synaptic currents whose amplitudes determine the probability that spiking will occur and influence the number of action potentials generated by pnc giant neurons  <cit> . such compound excitatory synaptic currents  are therefore a decisive factor for the elicitation and amplitude of a startle response.

in the first two experiments, we showed that in c57/bl <dig> mice  both the tactile and acoustic startle responses decreased when repetitive stimuli of these modalities were presented and similarly demonstrated that synaptic depression is induced when acoustic or trigeminal fibers synapsing on pnc giant neurons are repeatedly stimulated.

there was a slight difference in absolute acoustic startle amplitudes in one group of animals tested before tactile habituation  and in two other groups of animals tested either after tactile habituation or after exposure to the  <dig> db background noise only . this difference was small  and statistically insignificant. the  <dig> db background noise used during tactile stimulation could account for the slightly lower acoustic startle amplitudes in fig. 4b. however, after exposure to background noise, both groups of animals in fig. 4b still showed acoustic startle habituation not statistically different from the habituation in fig. 4a. the critical factor in this experiment is the lack of difference between the acoustic startle amplitudes of the two groups of mice in fig. 4b , even though only one group had received prior tactile stimulation.

interestingly, the decline in startle response amplitudes of the c57bl/ <dig> mice was generally greater when the tactile  or trigeminal  afferents were stimulated than when acoustic/auditory fibers were stimulated. this implies that short-term habituation to acoustic stimuli is generally weaker in these animals compared to habituation to tactile stimuli. indeed, it has been reported that the amount of short-term habituation varies enormously between different stimulus modalities and that the degree of habituation is also dependent on the mouse strain  <cit> . however, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that habituation to the  background noise during tactile startle measurements summates with the tactile startle habituation, although the background noise was switched on  <dig> min. before measurements started and tactile habituation showed a perfect exponential decay. moreover, background noise should actually lead to sensitization, a process that counteracts habituation  <cit> . additionally, the behavioral results closely parallel the electrophysiological findings, adding to the growing body of evidence that pnc giant neurons are indeed a vital station in the startle pathway  <cit> . the results also strongly indicate that habituation takes place inside this pathway, namely in the form of synaptic depression at the synapse of the sensory inputs to the giant neurons  <cit> .

localization of synaptic depression
the main goal of this study was to determine whether the cellular substrate for short-term habituation, which is presumably the result of synaptic depression in sensory synapses within the pnc, is located in the sensory part of the startle pathway , or if this is instead a postsynaptic feature. given the association of synaptic depression with short-term habituation, a presynaptic mechanism would imply that short-term habituation occurs before signals from different pathways are integrated in the pnc. habituation would therefore be specific for each stimulus modality and would not generalize between different modalities. we tested this in electrophysiological experiments with rats and mice and in behavioral experiments conducted with mice from the same strain . this is vital, as large differences between different mouse strains have been found with respect to habituation  <cit> .

both approaches showed that both synaptic depression and short-term habituation are pathway specific. this is also consistent with behavioral studies of other species and mouse strains, which demonstrated that short-term habituation is modality specific  <cit> . the pathway specificity signals that a presynaptic mechanism is involved and further evidence is provided by our data showing that the paired pulse ratio changes during depression, since alterations in short-term plasticity are commonly thought to reflect presynaptic changes in the transmitter release machinery  <cit> . however, it should be noted that the paired pulse ratio declined during synaptic depression, which is the opposite of what would be expected if the decrease in synaptic efficacy is due to a reduced probability of transmitter release. this is normally accompanied by an increase in the paired pulse ratio, since the accumulated calcium in the presynaptic terminal meets a larger pool of releasable transmitter  <cit> .

different mechanisms could account for a reduced paired pulse ratio; either the desensitization of postsynaptic glutamate receptors or presynaptic mechanisms, such as the exhaustion of releasable transmitter in the presynaptic terminal.

mechanism of depression
only repeated activation by short trains of at least four presynaptic action potentials produced an exponential decay of the cepsc amplitudes in pnc neurons. since trains of presynaptic action potentials lead to a strong and sustained release of the neurotransmitter glutamate into the synaptic cleft, desensitization of postsynaptic glutamate receptors could easily account for the resulting synaptic depression. however, several results rule out receptor desensitization as the underlying mechanism; first, the time course and the degree of depression were comparable when bursts were applied either every second or only every  <dig> seconds. in contrast, recovery from receptor desensitization should occur completely within  <dig> sec. second, synaptic responses to single pulses as well as the responses to the first pulse within a burst were not  affected by synaptic depression, but desensitized postsynaptic receptors should have had a similar effect on both response types. moreover, repeated uncaging of exogenous glutamate at  <dig> hz evoked responses with no sign of desensitization.

in summary, all of our results clearly contradict the hypothesis that postsynaptic receptor desensitization or changes in postsynaptic passive conductances can account for synaptic depression. instead, our data provide ample behavioral and electrophysiological evidence that synaptic depression is a presynaptic phenomenon. future studies will have to identify the molecular processes responsible for the alterations in synaptic transmission described here.

CONCLUSIONS
we can conclude from our behavioral and electrophysiological data that synaptic depression and its behavioral correlate short-term habituation are features of the sensory branch of the startle pathway; specifically, they are a function of sensory synaptic terminals in the pnc. synaptic depression/short-term habituation therefore occur prior to multimodal signal integration in the pnc, where signals from different pathways converge. our data also further corroborate the association of short-term habituation and synaptic depression in the pnc.
