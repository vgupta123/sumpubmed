BACKGROUND
a "head-to-head"  or "bidirectional" gene pair is a gene organization that two adjacent genes that locate on opposite strands of dna and transcribe divergently. the "bidirectional promoter" is the inter-genic region between a h2h gene pair  <cit> . such an h2h organization has been shown ancient and conserved in evolution  <cit> . many h2h genes have association in expression and in functionality because that the organization of sharing a bidirectional promoter, which coordinately regulates the transcription of the two h2h genes, makes the related biological process more efficient  <cit> .

there have been many studies analyzing the promoter features of h2h genes, including the distance between h2h genes  <cit> , the gc frequency of bidirectional promoter  <cit> , and the existence of transcription factor binding site   <cit> . however, most of these h2h analyses focused on human genome. some works  <cit>  compared human h2h genes to those of other organisms such as fugu, chicken, mouse and prokaryotes. nevertheless, their discussions still focused on the conservation of only human h2h genes. in addition to human genome, gavalas et al.  <cit>  and schuettengruber et al.  <cit>  discussed specific h2h genes in chicken and mouse but did not perform a genome-wide analysis. in addition to the organism, the analyzed features in the previous studies were also limited to those requiring only gene or protein  sequences. this is mainly because that some transcription-related features such as the binding evidence of specific transcription factors  are more difficult to obtain than gene/protein sequences.

in this study, we conducted several analyses to recognize the characteristics of the bidirectional promoters of associated h2h genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the most benefit of using a simple model organism such as s. cerevisiae is the considerable resources that are publicly available. based on the same reason, wang et al.  <cit>  analyzed the h2h genes of arabidopsis thaliana in  <dig>  for human genome, researchers have to use the existence of tfbs in bidirectional promoters as a compromising way to predict tf-binding. for yeast genome, on the other hand, monteiro et al. have collected  <dig>  tf-promoter pairs with experimentally verified binding evidences in  <dig> and kept updating their database, yeastract  <cit> . to date , yeastract contained  <dig>  tf-binding evidences  <cit> . the presence or absence of tata boxes in the promoter is also an important information which has been shown to influence the transcriptional plasticity--the capacity of regulation adjustment upon stimuli  <cit> . basehoar et al. reported the genomic locations of  <dig>  tata boxes in the promoters of  <dig>  yeast genes  <cit> .

our group recently collected a large amount of promoter features from six databases and five papers, and carefully revised and corrected them into nine kinds of promoter features  <cit> . these data are valuable to study h2h genes from various features. this study aims to analyze comprehensive features rather than to propose new analyzing algorithms. in this regard, we adopted the established analyzing techniques from previous studies  <cit>  to examine the expression and functional similarity of  <dig>  h2h gene pairs in s. cerevisiae. our results suggest that i) the frequency of h2h genes was close to the expectation, namely they were not relatively frequent in genome; ii) the distance between the tsss of most h2h genes fell into the range of 0- <dig> bps and was more centralized in 0- <dig> bps of the highly associated ones; iii) the number of tfs that regulate both h2h genes influenced the co-expression and co-function of the genes, while the number of tfs that bind both h2h genes influenced only the co-expression of the genes; iv) the association of two h2h genes was influenced by the existence of specific tfs such as stp2; v) the association of h2h genes whose bidirectional promoters have no tata box was slightly higher than those who have tata boxes; vi) the association of two h2h genes was not influenced by the dna bendability and nucleosome occupancy.

these observations expand the knowledge of h2h gene organization. furthermore, these analyses of h2h genes on various promoter features can be applied to other genomes, of which the results can then been compared with this study to confirm if the observations of this study are limited to s. cerevisiae or universal in other organisms.

RESULTS
identification of h2h gene pairs
we retrieved the genomic locations of the start and stop codons of  <dig>  genes from the saccharomyces genome database   <cit>  and the transcription start sites , 5'utrs and 3'utrs of  <dig>  genes from  <cit> . the  <dig>  genes form  <dig>  pairs of adjacent genes over  <dig> chromosomes.  <dig> pairs whose two coding regions are overlapped were excluded. the remaining  <dig>  pairs of adjacent non-overlapped genes were categorized into three groups: i)  <dig>  h2h gene pairs where the two genes sit on opposite strands and transcribe divergently, ii)  <dig>  head-to-tail  gene pairs where the two genes sit on the same strand and iii)  <dig>  tail-to-tail  gene pairs where the two genes sit on opposite strands and transcribe in a convergent manner. furthermore, this study created a sub-group of  <dig> h2h gene pairs where the tsss of both genes were available. in the following analyses, this sub-group was used if tss is required; otherwise the three original groups were used.

distribution of adjacent genes by chromosome
the distribution of adjacent genes analyzed in this study is shown in table  <dig>  though different chromosomes had distinct lengths and number of genes, the gene density was quite stable . furthermore, the ratio of h2h gene pairs was stable  and close to the expectation of 25%. the ratios of h2t and t2t gene pairs were also close to their expectation of 50% and 25%, respectively. our results indicate that the arrangement of h2h, h2t and t2t in genome is by random, which seems to be conflict to the previous studies  <cit>  claiming that h2h genes are more frequent in genome. actually in our analysis, t2t should be the most frequent gene organization  in comparison with the expected frequency.

 <dig> number of genes per  <dig> kbp.

this is because that the previous studies used the ratio of genes involved in h2h pairs to all genes. the fact that a gene has two neighbors and involves in two pairs was somehow ignored. we argued that the observation--~50% genes are involved in h2h pairs--in the previous studies is correct, but this number does not indicate that h2h genes enrich in genome. our analysis, which regarded gene pair a unit and is more accurate in this issue, indicates that the h2h organization is formed nearly by random.

in addition, we propose a bold conjecture that t2t is a gene organization for "storage". more precisely, organisms must store sufficient genes in a limited genome size. however, randomly arranging genes might lead to "interference", co-regulation of two genes that should not be transcribed together. though organisms have other mechanisms such as microrna  <cit>  to prevent unwanted transcriptions, arranging them in a t2t manner requires relatively small effort. based on this conjecture, the higher t2t frequency might be accumulated in evolution where some organisms were extinct because of lethally transcription interference.

distance between adjacent genes
the distributions of distance between adjacent genes are shown in figure  <dig>  adjacent gene pairs separated by more than  <dig> bps, which accounted for less than 3% of adjacent genes, were not shown. distance between the coding regions, denoted cr distance, of the three kinds--h2h, h2t and t2t--of adjacent gene pairs showed similar distribution plots , where most gene pairs fell into the range of 0- <dig> bps . we noted that  <dig> % t2t gene pairs fell into the range of 0- <dig> bps, which was obviously higher than h2h  and h2t  gene pairs. t2t genes with such short cr distances might have overlapped 3'utrs  so that they are unlikely to be transcribed together. this observation reinforces the conjecture that t2t gene is a gene organization for storage, where the phenomenon of many close t2t gene pairs is reasonable for a more compact and efficient storage.

the tss distances between h2h gene pairs, denoted tss distance, are shown in figure 1b. the tss distances between h2t and t2t gene pairs depend on the lengths of genes' coding regions and were excluded in this analysis. figure 1b also includes two sub-groups of the h2h genes pairs to observe the tss differences of h2h gene pairs with different level of functional similarity. in figure 1b, most h2h gene pairs fell into the range of 0- <dig> bps . it is noticed that h2h with high association led in all the three bins, while h2h with low association lagged behind other two distributions in all the three bins. in other words, h2h with high association was more "centralized" in the range of 0- <dig> bps, revealing that the tss distance is a potential feature to recognize h2h gene association.

based on this observation, we compared the distribution centrality of cr and tss distance . in the tss distance distribution, the ratio of h2h gene pairs of 0- <dig> bps was  <dig> %, higher than that in the cr distance distribution . if we focused on the top three bins, the cr distance distribution  was also lower than that in the tss distance distribution . in this regard, we can say that the distance between tsss was more centralized, and thus a better feature to recognize h2h gene association than the cr distance.

number of tfs in bidirectional promoter
one of the most contributions of this study to previous analyses of h2h genes is using binding and regulation evidence of tfs from literature rather than by prediction. the tf-binding evidence, based on band-shift, footprinting or chip assays, indicates whether a tf binds to the promoter of a gene; while the tf-regulation evidence, based on tf knockout assays, indicates whether knocking out a tf leads to a significant change of the expression of a gene. the yeastract database  <cit>  has collected the binding and regulation evidences of  <dig>  and  <dig>  tf-gene pairs, respectively. the ypa database  <cit>  has corrected some of these tf-gene pairs  and resulted in  <dig>  tf-binding and  <dig>  tf-regulation evidences.

values highlighted with bold font indicate using more than and equal to the number of tfs for sufficient pairs. for example, number of h2h pairs with four tfs with binding evidence is 117; while number of h2t pair with ≥ <dig> tfs with binding evidence is  <dig>  higher co-expression or functional association indicates better gene association; see the methods section for the details.

this suggests that more common tfs binding to both promoters of the adjacent genes only strengthened the co-expression but not the functional similarity. on the other hand, more common tfs regulating both adjacent genes strengthened both indices of gene association. this is reasonable since tf-binding evidence does not guarantee the activation of the downstream genes. here we conclude that the number of tfs regulating both adjacent genes is a critical feature to the association of adjacent genes. however, the tf-regulation evidence  was rarer than the tf-binding evidence  due to the experimental technologies. in this condition, number of tfs binding to both promoters of the adjacent genes is an alternative in applications that require only gene co-expression.

tfs that prefer regulation of h2h genes
the previous section focuses on the number of tfs in the bidirectional promoter. this section, on the other hand, aims to analyze if there is any specific tf whose existence in the bidirectional promoter determines the association of the h2h genes. we grouped our h2h gene pairs by the common tf. namely in a group of tf α, every pair had α as one of its common tfs. note that pairs with multiple common tfs appeared in multiple groups. we defined the e-score and f-score of a tf as the average co-expression and functional similarity, respectively, of pairs in the corresponding group. low e-score/f-score indicates that the h2h genes that the tf binds/regulates have low association. this implies that though the tf binds/regulates both h2h genes, the binding/regulation might be temporally different. conversely, high e-score/f-score indicates that the tf is prone to bind/regulate the h2h genes in the same time.

another aspect of preference is that the tf only binds/regulates h2h genes. the "%h2h" column in table  <dig> aims to measure this preference. high ratio indicates the tf usually binds/regulates h2h genes. for example, currently available literature shows that rpn4--stimulating proteasome genes by various stress responses--binds/regulates  <dig> genes and ~50% of them were h2h genes. however, no tf has both high %ppi and %h2h in table  <dig>  this suggests that tfs frequently binds/regulates h2h genes are not necessarily to influence the association of the bound/regulated h2h genes.

existence of tata boxes in bidirectional promoter
many analyses have demonstrated the importance of the presence or absence of tata boxes in the promoter  <cit> . we obtained the genomic locations of  <dig>  tata boxes from basehoar et al.'s work  <cit> , where  <dig>  ones were in the bidirectional promoters of our dataset. based on these data, the h2h gene pairs were divided into  <dig> tata-containing and  <dig> tata-less ones according to the presence or absence of tata boxes in the corresponding bidirectional promoters.

the distribution plots of co-expression and functional similarity of tata-containing and tata-less h2h gene pairs are shown in figure  <dig>  we found that tata-containing h2h gene pairs had higher frequency than tata-less ones in the low co-expression/functional similarity bins and had similar frequency in other bins. h2h gene pairs whose bidirectional promoters containing tata boxes had slightly lower co-expression  and functional similarity . but the small difference between tata-containing and tata-less h2h gene pairs reveals that the existence of tata boxes is not a critical feature to the association of h2h genes.

bendability and nucleosome occupancy in bidirectional promoter
the dna bendability influences the nucleosome positioning and further influences the accessibility of promoter sequences to tfs. tfs have been shown to favor nucleosome-depleted and rigid dna regions in the promoter  <cit> . the ypa database has obtained the nucleosome occupancy at every base pair in the yeast genome from  <cit>  and calculated the bending propensity of each base pair in the yeast genome based on the propensity table of tri-nucleotide in  <cit> . we used these data to group bidirectional promoters into more and less accessible ones. the bidirectional promoters that are more accessible to tfs were defined as those having at least an accessible sequence segment that is long enough for a tf to bind. in this study, we required that such bidirectional promoters have at least a consecutive sequence segment with ≥ <dig> bps  where every nucleotide has dna bendability lower than the genome average and has nucleosome occupancy lower than the genome average.

in figure 3a, though less accessible h2h gene pairs had higher frequency than more accessible ones in the lowest co-expression bin, they had lower frequency in the next two bins. in general, these three distributions were quite similar. this distribution difference was even smaller in term of functional similarity . thus, we conclude that dna bendability and nucleosome occupancy do not influence the association of h2h genes. this may result from that though nucleosome occupies some promoter regions that are critical to h2h gene regulation, nucleosome will detach from the promoter and spare space for tfs if required.

CONCLUSIONS
a systematic investigation of head-to-head gene organization based on various promoter features was conducted in this work. we echoed and adjusted several known properties of h2h gene organization as well as provided new observations. these analyses can be applied on/compared to h2h genes of other organisms to confirm if the observations of this study are limited to s. cerevisiae or universal in most organisms.
