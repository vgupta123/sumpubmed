BACKGROUND
milk composition and microbiological characteristics are important factors for the dairy farmer , dairy industry , and consumer . milk composition varies according to factors such as breed, age, mammary gland health, lactation stage, nutritional management, and season  <cit> . nutritional management and modifications in diet composition are responsible for changes in milk protein and fat concentration. dry matter intake, available fiber, and the diet energy:protein ratio are considered some of the main factors affecting the fat and protein content of milk  <cit> .

mastitis is one of the most common diseases in dairy cows and results in great economic losses in the dairy industry  <cit> . mastitis is defined as a mammary gland inflammation that is generally caused by bacterial infections  <cit> . this disease negatively affects the physical-chemical characteristics, composition, and yield of milk  <cit> . these alterations are attributed to changes in vascular permeability due to the inflammatory process and the damage of epithelial cells that are responsible for the synthesis of milk components as well as changes in the enzymatic action of somatic cells or microorganisms in the infected mammary gland  <cit> .

it is essential to monitor intramammary infections  in dairy cows in order to maintain milk quality and herd health. several methods for diagnosing imi are available, and the bacteriologic culture of milk samples is considered the standard method  <cit> , but it is generally expensive and time consuming for routine screening. individual somatic cell count  is currently used to screen for imi status at the herd and cow levels because it is extensively available to dairy farmers and is less expensive than microbiological culture  <cit> . increased scc is associated with reductions in casein, milk fat, and lactose; increased enzymatic activity; and reduced quality and yield of dairy products  <cit> .

gyr cows represent an important percentage of brazilian dairy cattle herds primarily because of their high adaptability to tropical climates and dairy production systems  <cit> . in brazil, gyr and crossbred cows  compose the majority of dairy herds. gyr cows have been extensively used in tropical conditions because they are considered to be well adapted to this environment; they are also resistant to some tropical diseases and have satisfactory productive performance  <cit> . a recent study showed that gyr dairy herds have a high prevalence of subclinical mastitis, which may negatively affect milk yield and composition  <cit> . however, the influence of mastitis-causing pathogens and scc on milk composition in gyr cows has not yet been determined.

the objectives of this study were  to evaluate the effect of seasonality, mammary quarter location , mastitis-causing pathogen species, and somatic cell count  on milk composition in gyr cows with mammary quarters as the experimental units and  to evaluate the effect of seasonality and somatic cell count  on milk composition in gyr cows with cows as the experimental units.

RESULTS
milk composition results were obtained from milk samples from  <dig> quarters  from  <dig> cows in three herds. the overall means were as follows:  <dig> %  lactose,  <dig> %  protein,  <dig> %  fat,  <dig> %  nonfat solids, and  <dig> %  total solids contents in all composite samples .

the final mixed-model linear regression results of the effect of mastitis-causing pathogens and scc on milk composition at the quarter level are shown in table  <dig>  the effect of imi on milk composition was dependent on isolated mastitis-causing pathogens. for example, intramammary infection caused by all of the studied mastitis-causing pathogens reduced the total solids content of milk, with estimated reduction ranging from  <dig> % ±  <dig>   to  <dig> % ±  <dig>  . compared with uninfected quarters , nonfat solids content was also negatively affected by imi caused by staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci  and streptococcus sp., but not by corynebacterium spp. intramammary infections caused by cns, streptococcus sp., and corynebacterium spp. reduced milk fat content. uninfected mammary quarters had estimated lactose content of  <dig> %, but this value was reduced by imi caused by corynebacterium spp. . intramammary infections caused by s. aureus, cns and streptococcus sp. resulted in no significant change in lactose content. milk protein content was reduced by imi caused by s. aureus  but was increased by imi caused by corynebacterium spp. . no significant effect of imi caused by cns and streptococcus sp. was observed for milk protein content.

somatic cell count negatively affected the lactose and nonfat solids content of milk at the quarter level in gyr cows. the mixed linear regression model estimated that each increase in scc of  <dig>  cells/ml reduced the lactose and nonfat solids content by  <dig> %. however, scc increased the protein, fat and total solids content. no effect of mammary quarter location on milk composition was detected between the front and rear mammary quarters . for the mammary quarter samples, seasonality significantly influenced milk composition . the levels of protein, fat, nonfat solids, and total solids were higher  and lactose content was lower  during the dry season than during the wet season .

the final mixed-model linear regression results of the effect of seasonality and scc on milk composition of composite samples are shown in table  <dig>  for the composite milk samples, scc levels also influenced milk composition. lactose and nonfat solids contents were negatively affected by scc. using a mixed linear regression model, it was estimated that each increase in scc of  <dig>  cells/ml reduced lactose and nonfat solids content by  <dig> . seasonality affected milk composition in the composite samples. protein, fat, nonfat solids, total solids contents were higher  during the wet season than during the dry season . however, the opposite effect occurred with lactose; lower levels were observed during the wet season  than the dry season .

discussion
the results of the present study indicate that imi negatively affects milk composition, although it has been shown that the degree of changes depends on the inflammatory response, the severity and amount of affected tissue in the mammary gland, and bacterial pathogenicity  <cit> , which may explain the differences of the effect of mastitis-causing pathogens on milk composition found in this study. milk composition is also affected by other factors such as age, lactation stage and nutritional practices  <cit> . however, these factors were not controlled in the present study.

bansal et al.  <cit>  determined that lactose content was higher  in healthy quarters than in quarters with a scc of > <dig>  cells/ml and negative culture  , which are results similar to those found in the present study. furthermore, these authors revealed a lower protein concentration  in healthy quarter samples than in non-specific mastitis quarters . however, in the present study, there was only a negative effect of imi caused by s. aureus on protein content. in composite samples, bansal et al.  <cit>  reported a negative mastitis effect only with regard to lactose content, with a higher value  for healthy samples than that for mastitis samples .

it has been observed that milk samples from infected quarters have higher total protein and whey protein values, but lower casein content  and lactose content when compared to milk samples from healthy quarters  <cit> . the increase in the permeability of blood-milk barrier during mastitis also results in an increased influx of serum proteins and enzymes from the blood, which may lead to an increase in proteolysis  <cit> . the findings reported by these authors showed an alteration in the protein composition in milk from affected quarters  when compared to milk from healthy quarters ; the level of casein, including α-casein and β-casein, was lower in milk samples from affected quarters than milk samples from healthy quarters, whereas the level of whey protein was increased due to proteolysis by proteolytic enzymes or decreased casein synthesis. however, in this study, the protein content analysis was based on the total protein value. the percentages of casein and whey protein were not calculated, which may explain the overall non-significant effect of mastitis on protein content.

some of the changes in milk composition are more marked than others; for example, lactose content is generally reduced as a result of mastitis due to decreased synthesis of this milk component  <cit> . for this reason, lactose concentration could be used as a mastitis indicator  <cit> . however, there are conflicting reports regarding the effect of mastitis on fat content. in the present study, imi caused by cns, streptococcus sp., and corynebacterium spp. significantly reduced milk fat content, which differs from the results of rogers et al.  <cit>  that show no effect of mastitis on fat content. kitchen  <cit>  and auldist et al.  <cit>  reported a lower fat concentration in milk samples from cows with subclinical mastitis, whereas mitchell et al.  <cit>  reported an increased fat concentration in mastitis-positive samples. bansal et al.  <cit>  reported that for german cows, higher fat content  was observed in foremilk quarter samples from non-specific mastitis samples than from healthy ones .

it has also been reported that milk samples from swedish cows with < <dig>  cells/ml did not present a significant difference between their front and rear quarters with regard to protein content but presented lower fat and higher lactose contents  in their rear quarters than in their front quarters   <cit> . in the present study, there was no effect of mammary quarter position on milk composition. furthermore, an increase in protein, fat and total solids contents was observed as the scc level increased. however, lactose and nonfat solids contents were affected in an opposite manner. a positive correlation between scc and fat, and protein contents  exists in composite samples from holstein cows  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated that the changes in milk composition caused by mastitis and high scc  may be explained by epithelial cell damage ; an increase in vascular permeability with the passage of immunoglobulins, serum protein and minerals ; and an increase in proteolytic activities  <cit> .

in a previous study, santos et al. <cit>  suggested that high scc might cause changes in milk composition because milk samples with a scc of > <dig>  cells/ml undergo greater alterations in milk chemistry characteristics than samples with low scc . similarly, our results indicated that scc linearly affects milk composition. in a study by ogola et al. <cit>  with zebu cows, the lactose content and acid degree value were lower  in samples with an scc of > <dig>  cells/ml than in samples with an scc between  <dig>  to  <dig>  cells/ml , but no effect was observed for scc on protein content  <cit> . elevated scc is accompanied by changes in milk composition, which may result in decreased cheese yield, increased rennet clotting time, reduction of the shelf-life of pasteurized milk, modifications in thermal stability, and others  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
intramammary infections in gyr cows alter milk composition. however, the degree of change depends on the mastitis-causing pathogen. somatic cell count is negatively associated with reduced lactose and nonfat solids content in milk. seasonality significantly affects milk composition, in which the lactose, fat, protein, nonfat solids and total solids concentration differs between the dry and wet seasons in gyr cows.
