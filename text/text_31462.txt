BACKGROUND
environmental factors that impose water-deficit stress, such as drought, salinity and extreme temperatures, place major limits on plant productivity  <cit> . it is a problem that deserves global attention. in particular, increasing soil salinization has necessitated the identification of crop traits/genes that confer resistance to salinity. traditional breeding strategies are limited by the complexity of stress tolerance traits, low genetic variance of yield components under stress conditions and the lack of efficient selection techniques  <cit> . with the great progress of molecular biology, introducing some functional genes of interest to crop plants by genetic engineering seems to be a shortcut to improve stress tolerance  <cit> . however, the approach has been limited by the lack of understanding of metabolic flux, compartmentation and function  <cit> . thus, the integrative, whole genome studies of various stress-resistant mechanisms are needed  <cit> . a series of functional genomics strategies have emerged as required and the applications of these new technologies will accelerate the relevant research.

expressed sequence tags , which are generated by large-scale single-pass sequencing of randomly picked cdna clones, have proven to be an efficient and rapid means to identify novel genes  <cit> . with many large-scale est sequencing projects in progress and new projects being initiated, comparative genomics approaches are needed to assign putative functions to these cdnas  <cit> . such studies will present opportunities to accelerate progress towards understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying stress response of plants.

glycine soja  is one of the highly salt tolerant species that grows in coastal regions. the seeds were found to tolerate up to  <dig> % of salt during germination stage, while glycine max cannot grow well in regions where the salt concentration is  <dig> %  <cit> . it is thus an ideal candidate plant for mining salt-tolerance genes.

in this study, single-pass sequences of randomly selected cdna clones from a full-length cdna library of glycine soja leaf treated with  <dig> mm nacl were obtained. the ests were classified into functional categories through comparisons with glycine max, arabidopsis and oryza sativa genes in known databases. the potential roles of gene products associated with stress related ests were discussed.

RESULTS
generation of ests from glycine soja subjected to salt stress
the information provided by ests of randomly isolated gene transcripts generated under specific abiotic stress conditions provides an opportunity for gene discovery in addition to identifying the biochemical pathways involved in plant physiological responses  <cit> . here, we describe ests obtained from salinity-induced cdna library prepared from the leaves of the glycine soja exposed to stress for a short period of time. insert amplification of all random clones from cdna library revealed inserts ranging between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, with an average size of  <dig> bp. a total of  <dig>  clones were sequenced, and  <dig>  cleaned est sequences were generated for further analysis after trimming off vector sequences and removing of sequences shorter than  <dig> bp . the average read-length of cleaned ests was  <dig> bp. the cleaned ests include  <dig> 5'end sequences and  <dig> 3'end sequences . the average g+c content of glycine soja ests was 40%, which is similar to that of soybean  <cit> . the  <dig> ests were assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets  using the phrap program . the frequency of est distribution after clustering is shown in fig.  <dig>  nine contigs had  <dig> or more ests, with the largest one containing  <dig> ests. most contigs contained one to six ests. the redundancy level of est collection was 65%, which means that continued sequencing of cdnas selected at random from our libraries still has considerable potential to uncover novel sequences.

comparisons of glycine soja ests with those in glycine max, arabidopsis and oryza sativa
blastn was used to compare the est sequences of glycine soja to glycine max, arabidopsis and rice. the e-value was set at 1e- <dig>  although the size of glycine max gene index is smaller than the agi and ogi, the sum of matching section between glycine soja and glycine max  was far more than glycine soja versus arabidopsis or glycine soja versus oryza sativa . note that there is great difference in stress-tolerant characteristics between soybean and wild soybean, although they share a large amount of homologs in expressed sequences. this indicates that the discrepancy in stress responses may come from the subtle difference between the homologous sequences. it is therefore feasible to investigate the wild soybean's gene expression profile using the affymetrix soybean chip.

in order to get more information about the expression pattern of glycine soja ests, blastn was used to search against the arabidopsis cds from tair, and  <dig> ests were highly similar to genes from arabidopsis. the corresponding arabidopsis genes were searched for the expression data under salt stress since global expression profiling of the arabidopsis was available from tair <cit> . as a result, a total of  <dig> ests were predicted to be up-regulated in response to salt stress according to atgenexpress, and may be induced by salt stress. this prediction will be confirmed by further analysis.

functional categorization of glycine soja ests and putative stress-regulated genes
as shown in tables  <dig> and figure  <dig>  all unigenes were classified according to terms of biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components, developed by the gene ontology consortium  <cit>  in uniprot . these genes cover a broad range of the go functional categories. however, due to the lack of gene products information, many transcripts cannnot be functionally categorized. these 'unknown' genes are likely the source of candidate salt-tolerant genes and further functional analysis will help elucidate their specific roles in salt tolerance  <cit> .

we successfully classified  <dig> unigenes in terms of biological processes ,  <dig> unigenes in terms of molecular function , and  <dig> unigenes in terms of cellular components. since one gene product may be assigned to more than one go terms, and one children term can fit into multiple parental categories, the total number of go mappings in each of the three ontologies will exceed the number of genes.

a large proportion of genes were found to participate in the biological process of metabolism , followed by cell growth and/or maintenance . the accumulation of osmoprotectants by either altering metabolism or increasing transport is an important process of plants for the adaptation to environmental stress  <cit> . it has been reported that in arabidopsis, salinity induces programmed cell death in primary roots and the plants produce secondary roots which function better under abiotic stress  <cit> . the increase in metabolism could be essential to nutrient redistribution and new tissue development, a strategy the plants adopted to cope with the changed environment.

our results showed that 4% of the unigene set responds to external stimulus, while 2% responds to stress . these two catgories form the basis for mining the stress-regulated genes. genes encoding dehydration-induced erd <dig> protein , late embryogenesis abundant  protein  and other stress-induced proteins were found in these categories. submergence induced gene, induced by anaerobic stress, was also found in the ests sequenced . there were also other genes function as scavengers of reactive oxygen species, such as catalase, glutathione s-transferase, and superoxide dismutase. these gene products are needed to maintain the redox homeostasis under abiotic stress. it was reported that overexpression of h2o2-scavenging enzymes increased the tolerance of plants to abiotic stress <cit> . metallothioneins  are a group of low-molecular-weight  metal-binding proteins with a high cysteine content that are thought to be involved in metal ion metabolism and detoxification  <cit> . mt-like transcripts have been reported to be highly up-regulated in response to salt stress in barley  <cit> . type  <dig> metallothionein  was present in our database.

in addition, proteins involved in the regulation of signal transduction pathway  have been categorized separately. in plant cells, calcium functions as a second messenger coupling a wide range of extracellular stimuli to intracellular responses  <cit> . calmodulin, one major class of ca2+ sensor characterized in plants, which was present in the glycine soja ests , is involved in stress signal transduction suggested by several lines of evidence  <cit> .

genes for transcription factors that contain typical dna binding motifs, such as myb, bzip, have been demonstrated to be stress inducible  <cit> . transcription factors containing similar domains are present in the glycine soja ests and may be important in regulating the response to salt stress.

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced  <dig> ests generated from salinity-treated glycine soja cdna library, putatively representing  <dig> unigenes. comparison of glycine soja ests with those of glycine max revealed the potential to investigate the wild soybean's expression profile using the soybean's gene chip. through analysis of the ests with putative functional annotations, a large number of putative stress-regulated genes were identified. the full-length cdnas of these genes can be obtained easily and their specific functions in salt tolerance can be further investigated using transformation technology in model systems, which will eventually provide new gene targets for the genetic engineering of other crop plants for improved resistance to abiotic stresses. our results will also facilitate genomic analysis in other plant systems.
