BACKGROUND
brucellosis is a widespread and economically important infectious disease of animals and humans caused by members of the genus brucella. brucella spp. are small gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogens that cause abortion, retained placenta and infertility in numerous domestic and wild mammals, and a disease known as undulant fever in humans  <cit> . transmission of brucella spp. from infected animals to humans may be either direct or indirect. direct transmission involves the respiratory, conjunctival and cutaneous routes, and is more important in people in close contact with infected animals. indirect transmission is through the consumption of contaminated dairy products  <cit> . brucella spp. occasionally causes spontaneous abortion in pregnant women  <cit> .

there have been several histological studies on the placentas of brucella infected animals  <cit> . further, it has been found that brucella internalizes into the caprine erythrophagocytic trophoblastic epithelial cells from the maternal circulation  <cit>  and that the internalized bacteria replicate within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in secondary infection of adjacent trophoblastic epithelial cells  <cit> . researches have also shown that after necrosis of infected trophoblasts, large numbers of brucellae are released, and proximity of the fetal capillaries in the ulcerated placenta to the lumenal bacteria has been proposed as the source of the fetal bacteremia and further placental infection  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism of abortion induced by brucella spp. remains unknown.

the mouse model, particularly that using the unpregnant mouse, has been used extensively to study some aspects of the pathogenesis of brucellosis  <cit> . while brucellosis is known to primarily affect the reproductive tract in the natural host, little is known regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of brucella infection in the pregnant mouse  <cit> . although the structure of bovine placenta is completely different from mouse placenta, the infectious abortion model using the pregnant mouse is a powerful tool for investigating the mechanisms of brucella pathogenesis. in our previous study, we demonstrated that b. abortus causes abortion in pregnant mice by inoculating bacteria on day  <dig>  of gestation  <cit> . we found that there was a higher degree of bacterial colonization in the placenta than in other organs, that there were many bacteria in trophoblast giant  cells in the placenta and that an intracellular replication-defective mutant did not induce abortion. these findings suggest that bacterial infection of tg cells plays a key role in abortion induced by b. abortus infection.

pregnancy leads to a generalized suppression of the adaptive immune system, typified by significantly decreased cell-mediated immunity and reduced t helper cell   <dig> responsiveness  <cit> . this immunosuppressed state prevents maternal rejection of the fetus but has the unfortunate consequence of increasing maternal susceptibility to certain infectious agents  <cit> . our previous study showed that a transient increase in interferon -γ due to brucella infection contributes to abortion in pregnant mice  <cit> . in addition to examining the balance of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines in bacteria infected pregnant mice, analysis of bacterial internalization into the tg cells, a specific host cells in placenta, will help to advance our knowledge regarding the control of brucella-induced abortion.

in the present study, we investigated the internalization of b. abortus into tg cells and identified heat shock cognate protein  <dig>  as a candidate receptor against brucella or bacterial uptake-associated molecule. we noted that ifn-γ enhances bacterial internalization into tg cells.

trophoblast stem  cells were cultured in ts medium in the presence of fgf <dig>  heparin and mouse embryonic fibroblast -conditioned medium as described previously  <cit> . the ts medium was prepared by adding 20% fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate,  <dig> μm β-mercaptoethanol, and  <dig> mm l-glutamine to rpmi  <dig>  to induce differentiation to trophoblast giant  cells, the cells were cultured in the only ts medium alone for  <dig> days at 37°c in co <dig> incubator. the tg cells were seeded  in  <dig> well tissue culture plates for all assays.

efficiency of bacterial internalization and replication within cultured cells
bacterial infection and intracellular survival assays were performed according to a modified version of the method of kim et al  <cit> . b. abortus strains were deposited onto ts or tg cells at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> which had been grown on 48-well microtiter plates containing ts medium but no antibiotics by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at room temperature. to measure bacterial internalization efficiency after  <dig> min of incubation at 37°c, the cells were washed once with ts medium and then incubated with ts medium containing gentamicin  for  <dig> min. next, cells were washed three times with pbs and lysed with cold distilled water. cfu values were determined by serial dilution on brucella plates. to measure intracellular replication efficiency, infected cells were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min, washed once with ts medium and then incubated with ts medium containing gentamicin  for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. the cell washing, lysis and plating procedures were the same as for the bacterial internalization efficiency assay. percentage protection was determined by dividing the number of bacteria surviving by the number in the infectious inoculum. the purified the r2– <dig> antibody or recombinant ifn-γ  was added to the ts medium at the indicated concentrations  <dig> or  <dig> h before infection.

RESULTS
b. abortus internalizes and replicates in trophoblast giant cells
we previously reported that there were many bacteria in trophoblast giant  cells in the placenta by inoculation of pregnant mice with b. abortus  <cit> . to examine this bacterial infection into tg cells further, we used in vitro cell culture system of trophoblast stem  cells and tg cells differentiated from ts cells. the b. abortus internalized into tg cells more efficiently than ts cells . we also investigated the intracellular replication of b. abortus in ts and tg cells. the bacteria replicated more efficiently in tg cells than ts cells .

several intracellular pathogens attached to the host plasma membrane induce actin polymerization around the site of bacterial attachment and the process is essential for bacterial entry  <cit> . we therefore examined actin polymerization by means of fluorescence microscopy after  <dig> min and  <dig> h of incubation of ts and tg cells infected with b. abortus. it has been noted that differentiated tg cells dramatically rearrange their actin cytoskeleton into thick bundles of stress fibers  <cit> . there was no apparent actin polymerization around the site of the bacterial entry after  <dig> min incubation on tg cells or  <dig> h of incubation of infected tg cells .

isolation of monoclonal antibodies that inhibit bacterial internalization into tg cells
to identify a receptor against b. abortus on tg cells, rats were immunized with tg cells, and monoclonal antibodies that inhibit bacterial internalization into tg cells were isolated. seventy-five clones of bacterial internalization inhibiting antibodies  were isolated from  <dig>  hybridoma supernatants. from among the monoclonal antibodies, we selected r2– <dig>  since it significantly inhibited internalization and showed clear reactions with protein in immunoblotting. the purified r2– <dig> antibody significantly inhibited bacterial internalization concentration dependently, but there was no inhibition with rat igg  . the r2– <dig> antibody reacted with protein of around  <dig> kda which was localized in membrane and cytosol, with the protein amount in the membrane fraction being especially large . on examining the distribution of protein reacting with r2– <dig> on the surface of tg cells by immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed an islet-like distribution on the surface of tg cells which was no permeabilized cells . it was difficult to detect the protein reacting with the r2– <dig> antibody on the surface of permeabilized cells.

antibody inhibiting bacterial internalization reacts with heat shock cognate protein 70
we performed mass spectrometry analysis to identify the protein reacting with the r2– <dig> antibody. proteins of the membrane fraction were separated by sds-page and transferred to a pvdf membrane . the protein reacting with r2– <dig> was extracted from the pvdf membrane and the subjected to lc-ms/ms analysis. through a search of the mascot database, the protein reacting with r2– <dig> was determined to be heat shock cognate protein  <dig>  . the anti-hsc <dig> antibody also reacted with this protein . to confirm that the r2– <dig> antibody reacted with hsc <dig>  we tested its reactivity with mouse and bovine recombinant hsc <dig>  as expected, the r2– <dig> and anti-hsc <dig> antibodies reacted with both types of recombinant hsc <dig> . the mouse recombinant hsc <dig> had a slightly greater molecular weight than the bovine recombinant hsc <dig> because  <dig> amino acid residues had been added to the former after hrv 3c protease cleavage. these results indicate that the protein reacting with r2– <dig> was hsc <dig> 

hsc <dig> contributes to bacterial internalization into tg cells
to examine the effect of hsc <dig> on bacterial internalization into tg cells further, we reduced the amount of endogenous hsc <dig> by transfecting hsc70-specific small interfering rna  duplexes into the tg cells. after  <dig> h of transfection with hsc70-specific sirna, the expression level of hsc <dig> was no longer detectable, but was not affected by transfection with β-actin or the control sirna . thus, the internalization efficiency of b. abortus into tg cells was significantly reduced by transfection with hsc70-specific sirna . next, excessive production of endogenous hsc <dig> was induced by transfecting the hsc <dig> expression vector into tg cells. after  <dig> h, expression levels of hsc <dig> were significantly higher than the control levels . the internalization efficiency of b. abortus into tg cells in which hsc <dig> was over-expressed was significantly higher than the control levels .

ifn-γ enhances bacterial uptake by tg cells
since a transient increase in ifn-γ brought about by brucella infection promotes abortion in pregnant mice  <cit> , we investigated the effect of ifn-γ treatment on bacterial internalization and hsc <dig> expression in tg cells. ifn-γ treatment significantly increased the internalization efficiency of b. abortus into tg cells as their concentration, but had no effect in ts cells . to determine whether the enhancement of bacterial internalization by ifn-γ treatment was due to up-regulate hsc <dig> expression or not, rna was isolated from ifn-γ treated tg cells and subjected to rt-pcr. this showed that ifn-γ treatment did not affect hsc <dig> expression . ifn-γ receptor was expressed in ts and tg cells .

preventing abortion by inoculating pregnant mice with anti-hsc <dig> antibody
to determine if abortion is prevented by neutralizing the hsc <dig> expressed on tg cells in the mouse placenta, pregnant mice were inoculated with the r2– <dig> antibody  <dig> h before infection with b. abortus, which was done on day  <dig>  of gestation. while there was no change in the number of abortions observed in the non-inoculated mice, there was a significant increase in number of live fetuses in the inoculated mice . inoculation of uninfected pregnant mice with the r2– <dig> antibody did not affect on pregnancy . upon examining bacterial numbers in the spleen and placenta of infected pregnant mice, it was found that bacterial numbers were similar in both mice inoculated with the r2– <dig> antibody and those not inoculated with it .

discussion
previous mouse model studies have shown that brucella abortus specifically replicates in trophoblast giant  cells in the placenta  <cit> . tg cells are polyploid cells that play a crucial role in implantation, in remodeling of the embryonic cavity, and preventing maternal blood flow to the implantation site  <cit> . since b. abortus internalizes into tg cells and replicates in them, cell functions are not exhibited completely, which leads to abortion since implantation and placental development are inhibited. therefore, it is thought that bacterial infection of tg cells is a key event in inducing abortion. to analyze the molecular mechanisms of b. abortus infection of tg cells in vitro, we used trophoblast stem  cells and tg cells differentiated from ts cells for the infection assay in this study. although tg cell differentiation is fairly well understood at the morphological and molecular level  <cit> , the role of immune responses in fighting against pathogens of tg cells is poorly understood and in this regard a model of host-pathogen interaction using tg cells would be useful for obtaining new information of the effect of tg cell functions on pregnancy.

hsc <dig> has been reported to be present on the surface of several types of cells  <cit> . in this regard, though hsc <dig> congregates on the surface of tg cells, it is present to a much lesser extent on the surface of ts cells . this may be a reason that the internalization of b. abortus into tg cells was greater than that into ts cells. as hsc <dig> and many other factors will be present on tg cells differentiated from ts cells, there is a possibility that other receptors or bacterial uptake-associated molecules may contribute to b. abortus infection of tg cells. little is known about how hsc <dig>  a protein with no signal sequence for secretion, exits cells by mechanisms other than escape from cells undergoing necrotic lysis. in previous studies, hsc <dig> has seen to be released from a late endsomal lysosomal location where it participates in protein degradation  <cit> . further, the secretion of the hsp <dig> family and its association with lipid rafts have also been observed in epithelial cells under normal conditions, and a lipid raft-based mechanism has been suggested for the membrane delivery and release of hsp <dig> family  <cit> . although receptors for the extracellular hsp <dig> family have still not been fully defined, several cell surface receptors have been suggested, such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and scavenger receptor lox- <dig>  <cit> . since it has also been noted that class a scavenger receptor  contributes to b. abortus infection in macrophages  <cit> , sr-a may be receptors for hsc <dig>  and the mechanism for b. abortus internalization into tg cells may be the same pathway as that for hsc <dig> uptake by tg cells. hsc <dig> may have a function that is catching antigens and anti-hsc <dig> would inhibit binding between hsc <dig> and antigens. ifn-γ treatment enhanced bacterial internalization into tg cells and these observations agreed with results obtained in pregnant mice model  <cit> , and thus expression of unidentified receptors against hsc <dig> may be upregulated by ifn-γ treatment. ifn-γ should therefore promote internalization of b. abortus into tg cells in vivo and this would be one of ways in which infectious abortion is induced.

CONCLUSIONS
the finding of this study that the anti-hsc <dig> antibody prevents abortion caused by b. abortus infection is expected to be applied in the development of methods of preventing abortion. since intracellular bacteria such as brucella replicate in host cells, it is difficult to completely eliminate them from the host through treatment with antibiotics and develop effective vaccines against them. an alternative strategy in treating infection due to brucella would be inhibition of bacterial internalization into tg cells and this could be an effective means of protecting against abortion due to brucellosis. recently, carvalho neta et al. reported that b. abortus modulates innate immune response by bovine trophoblastic cells  <cit> . although the structure of bovine placenta is completely different from mouse placenta, bovine and mouse trophoblastic cells may have similar function in the immune system. however, it is not known whether the mechanism of host-pathogen interaction observed in this study could be used to develop protective methods against other abortion-inducing pathogen infections, and thus further analysis of tg cell function in the immune system will be needed to clarify host defense mechanisms in the placenta and those contributing to the success of pregnancy.
