BACKGROUND
eukaryotic genomes are packaged into the nucleus by histones and non histone proteins. histones are small, highly basic proteins that form a core around which the dna is wrapped. although chromatin is highly compacted, its structure is dynamic, allowing access to the dna for processes such as replication, transcription, recombination and repair  <cit> . nucleoid-associated proteins have been described in archaea and bacteria. these proteins resemble eukaryotic histones in their dna binding properties, low molecular weight, abundance and electrostatic charge. they organize and compact the prokaryotic genome and are involved in various processes, including gene expression  <cit> .

the proteins involved in dna packaging in eukaryotic organelles have not been fully characterized. in the protozoa of the trypanosomatidae family, the mitochondrial genome is contained within a specific region of the mitochondrion known as the kinetoplast. the kinetoplast dna  of trypanosomatids is organized into an unusual arrangement of circular molecules, catenated into a single network. two types of dna ring are present within the kinetoplast: maxicircles and minicircles. the maxicircles resemble the mitochondrial dna of higher eukaryotes, encoding rrnas and subunits of the respiratory complexes  <cit> . the minicircles encode guide rnas, which modify the maxicircle transcripts by extensive insertions and/or deletions of uridylate residues to form functional open reading frames, in a process known as rna editing  <cit> . the replication of kinetoplast dna requires a repertoire of molecules, including type ii topoisomerases, dna polymerases, universal minicircle sequence binding proteins, primases and ribonucleases  <cit> .

the molecules involved in maintaining the highly ordered organization of kdna in trypanosomatids remained unknown for many years. in  <dig>  steinert suggested that the kinetoplast dna was not associated with basic proteins  <cit> . however, souto-padrón and de souza provided cytochemical evidence that the kdna of trypanosoma cruzi was associated with basic proteins  <cit> . they suggested that such proteins might be involved in neutralizing the negatively charged dna molecules in close contact within the kinetoplast matrix. the proteins involved in kdna organization were not biochemically or molecularly characterized until the 1990s, following the isolation of kinetoplast-associated proteins  from crithidia fasciculata  <cit> . the kaps of c. fasciculata characterized to date  are small, highly basic proteins with a composition similar to that of the h <dig> histone, which contains lysine- and alanine-rich domains. these cfkaps have a cleavable nine-amino acid presequence in their n-terminal region that is absent from mature forms and probably involved in kinetoplast import  <cit> . cfkaps have been shown to be exclusively restricted to the kinetoplast in immunolocalization assays and to bind to minicircles and condense the kdna network in vitro  <cit> . several roles have been attributed to kaps in c. fasciculata. they may facilitate the side-to-side association of individual strands of dna through charge neutralization and influence the orientation of the kdna to facilitate interaction with specific minicircle sequences  <cit> . further evidence of the involvement of kaps in kdna organization in vivo was obtained by disrupting both alleles of the kap <dig> gene of c. fasciculata. the double-knockout mutant was viable, but presented substantial kdna rearrangement, including a high level of kdna fiber packaging and the appearance of a thicker layer in the middle of the kinetoplast disk  <cit> . surprisingly, this phenotypic modification was found to resemble the effects of treating c. fasciculata with topoisomerase ii inhibitors  <cit> . the inability of kaps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to complement kap <dig> function in kdna organization is consistent with kap <dig> having a role different from that of other kaps. indeed, kap  <dig> and  <dig> are involved in mitochondrial metabolism rather than kdna organization, as disruption of both alleles of the kap  <dig> and  <dig> genes increases the levels of several mitochondrial mrnas, reduces respiration rate and interferes with cell growth and morphology  <cit> .

despite some efforts to identify kinetoplast-associated proteins in t. cruzi, little is known about kaps in this protozoon  <cit> . t. cruzi is the etiologic agent of chagas disease and passes through several developmental stages during its life cycle. epimastigotes and amastigotes are the proliferative forms found in the insect host midgut and mammalian cells, respectively, whereas trypomastigotes are the non proliferative forms infecting the vertebrate host  <cit> . the differentiation of epimastigotes into trypomastigotes involves morphological changes, including kdna rearrangement. in the epimastigote and amastigote forms of t. cruzi, as in most trypanosomatids, the kdna fibers are tightly packed into a compact disk-shaped structure. conversely, trypomastigotes have a rounded kinetoplast, with a more relaxed organization of kdna  <cit> . the conversion of the kinetoplast disk into a globular structure probably involves a mechanism controlling the type of kaps associated with the kdna or the extent to which these proteins associate with the dna network at different stages of parasite development.

in this work, we have analyzed kap coding sequences in trypanosomatid genomes, organized them by means of phylogenetic and syntenic analyses and defined two kap proteins distinct from those originally described in c. fasciculata. in addition, two kinetoplast-associated proteins of t. cruzi, tckap <dig> and tckap <dig>  were cloned, expressed and antisera were generated against recombinant proteins. imunolabeling assays revealed a differential distribution of tckaps in the kinetoplast of distinct developmental stages of the parasite.

methods
cell culture
epimastigote forms of t. cruzi   <cit>  were grown in liver infusion tryptose  medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 28°c. bloodstream trypomastigote forms derived from the blood of swiss mice were used to infect the llc-mk <dig> cells. trypomastigotes were released seven days after infection in the supernatant and purified by centrifugation. amastigotes were obtained by disruption of the llc-mk <dig> cells after four days of infection with trypomastigotes. it is worth mentioning that the amastigotes released after disruption of the cells are mixed with intermediate forms, which represent a transitional stage between amastigotes and trypomastigotes  <cit> .

dna extraction
dna was extracted as described by medina-acosta and cross  <cit> .

genome search for t. cruzi orthologs of cfkaps
the cfkaps1– <dig> protein sequences were retrieved from genbank®  <cit>  and a blastp search  <cit>  was performed against all protein sequences from trypanosomatids with a complete sequenced genome, available in genbank® . all hits having an e-value lower than 1e10- <dig> were selected for further analyses. sequences that were redundant or did not contain a discernible nine amino acids presequence, suggestive of kinetoplast import, were discarded.

evolutionary analysis of trypanosomatids kaps
multiple sequence alignments  were produced with the clustalw software  <cit>  and a phylogenetic analysis was performed using the mrbayes software  <cit> , running in parallel  <cit>  in a  <dig> nodes cluster, by  <dig> , <dig> generations, with gamma correction , allowing for invariant sites. a mixed amino acid model was used and the wag fixed rate model  <cit>  prevailed with a posterior probability of  <dig> . msas and trees were visualized with the jalview  <cit>  and treeview software  <cit> , respectively

cloning and expression of the tckap <dig> and tckap <dig> genes
primers were designed to amplify the entire coding region of these genes from the t. cruzi dm28c genome. primers tckap4-f   and tckap4-r   were constructed based on the sequence with genbank id xm_ <dig> and used to amplify the tckap <dig> coding region, whereas the sequence with genbank id xm_ <dig> was used to design the primers tckap6-f   and tckap6-r   for pcr amplification of the tckap <dig> coding region. the forward primers contain bamhi sites whereas the reverse primers contain sali sites . pcr was carried out in the following reaction mixture:  <dig> pmol of each pair of primers,  <dig> ng of t. cruzi genomic dna,  <dig> μm dntps,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm kcl and  <dig>  units of taq dna polymerase . reactions were carried out in a geneamp pcr system  <dig>  thermal cycler, with an initial denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> s, 58°c for  <dig> s and 72°c for  <dig> s. we obtained an amplified product of  <dig>  kb for tckap <dig> and  <dig>  kb for tckap <dig>  the pcr products were purified with a high-purity pcr product purification kit , digested with bamhi and sali and inserted into the pqe <dig> expression vector . the his6-tagged recombinant proteins were produced in the e. coli m <dig> strain following induction with  <dig> mm iptg  and culture for an additional  <dig> h at 37°c.

purification of recombinant tckaps
the recombinant proteins were largely insoluble and were obtained from the inclusion bodies. the pellets of cultures of e. coli expressing tckap <dig> or tckap <dig>  were resuspended in  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm tris hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  m nacl and subjected to five pulses of sonication for  <dig> s each at 4°c . the sonicated extracts of e. coli were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min at 4°c. the supernatant was discarded and the pellets containing the inclusion bodies were washed three times in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  m nacl, 2% triton x- <dig>  resuspended in  <dig> ml of the protein sample buffer for sds-page  and resolved in 15% polyacrylamide gels  at  <dig> volts for  <dig> h at room temperature. after electrophoresis, the gels were incubated in cold kcl  for  <dig> min to visualize the bands of proteins. the recombinant protein bands were excised from the gels, electroeluted in a dialysis bag at  <dig> v for  <dig> h in sds-page buffer and dialyzed against pbs , ph  <dig> .

production of polyclonal antisera
polyclonal antisera against the recombinant proteins were produced in mice. the animals were immunized by intraperitoneal injection with  <dig> μg of the appropriate antigen in freund's complete adjuvant  for the first inoculation and with  <dig> μg of the recombinant protein with freund's incomplete adjuvant  for three booster injections at two-week intervals. antisera were obtained five days after the last booster injection.

immunoblotting
for immunoblotting analysis, cell lysates  were separated by sds-page in 15% polyacrylamide gels and the protein bands were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane  according to standard protocols  <cit> . nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the membrane with 5% nonfat milk powder and  <dig> % tween- <dig> in pbs, ph  <dig>  for  <dig> min. membranes were then incubated for  <dig> h with the polyclonal antiserum raised against the recombinant protein  diluted 1: <dig> in blocking solution. the membrane was washed three times in pbs and then incubated for  <dig> min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse igg secondary antibody  diluted 1: <dig>  in blocking solution. bound antibodies were detected with the bcip /nbt  solution kit . the pre immune sera were also tested, as described above. the antibody anti-polyhistidine  was diluted 1: <dig>  in blocking solution and used to confirm the expression of tckaps in e. coli m <dig> strain.

immunofluorescence assays
the parasites were washed in pbs, ph  <dig>  and fixed by incubation with 4% freshly prepared formaldehyde in pbs for  <dig> min. cells were deposited on poly-l-lysine-treated microscope slides and permeabilized by incubation with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> in pbs, ph  <dig> , for  <dig> min. the slides were incubated in blocking solution containing  <dig> % bsa,  <dig> % teleostean gelatin,  <dig> % tween  <dig> in pbs, ph  <dig>  and were then incubated with anti-tckap <dig> or anti-tckap <dig> antiserum diluted 1: <dig> in blocking solution for  <dig> h. the parasites were washed and incubated with alexa fluor®  <dig> goat anti-mouse igg  diluted 1: <dig> in blocking solution for  <dig> min. the pre immune sera were also tested, as described above. the slides were mounted in n-propyl gallate and visualized by confocal laser scanning microscope . for control assays, the incubation with anti-tckap <dig> or anti-tckap <dig> was omitted.

transmission electron microscopy
protozoa were fixed in  <dig> % glutaraldehyde diluted in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer, ph  <dig> , for  <dig> h at room temperature and post-fixed in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer containing 1% oso <dig>   <dig> mm calcium chloride and  <dig> % potassium ferricyanide for  <dig> h. then, cells were dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and embedded in epoxy resin. ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed in a zeiss  <dig> transmission electron microscope.

ultrastructural immunocytochemistry
the parasites were fixed in  <dig> % glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde and 1% picric acid diluted in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer, ph  <dig>  and then dehydrated at -20°c in a graded series of ethanol solutions. the material was progressively infiltrated with unicryl at lower temperatures and resin polymerization was carried out in beem capsules at -20°c for  <dig> days, under ultraviolet light. ultrathin sections were obtained with a leica ultramicrotome  and grids containing the sections were incubated with  <dig> mm nh4cl for  <dig> min. they were then incubated with blocking solution  for  <dig> min, followed by incubation with anti-tckap <dig> or anti-tckap <dig> antiserum diluted 1: <dig> in blocking solution for  <dig> h. the grids were then incubated for  <dig> min with gold-labeled goat anti-mouse igg  diluted 1: <dig> in blocking solution, washed and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for further observation in a zeiss  <dig> transmission electron microscope. for control assays, incubation with the primary antiserum was omitted.

RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis of kinetoplast-associated proteins in trypanosomatid species
as previously stated, originally five distinct kinetoplast-associated proteins were described in c. fasciculata, named cfkap1– <dig>  <cit> . however, the cfkap <dig>  also designated p <dig>  was never characterized. since little is known about kdna-associated proteins in t. cruzi  <cit>  and other trypanosomatids, we sought initially to address this problem by examining genome database of the t. cruzi  <cit> , t. brucei  <cit> , leishmania major  <cit> , l. infantum and l. braziliensis  <cit> . in a blastp search, using as query the available cfkap protein sequences, we have identified  <dig> protein sequences related to cfkaps:  <dig> in t. cruzi;  <dig> in l. braziliensis;  <dig> in l. major and l. infantum; and  <dig> in t. brucei. a phylogenetic analysis including these  <dig> sequences and the five cfkaps used as query was performed, in order to construct a phylogenetic tree . additionally, a synteny conservation analysis was performed, where chromosome location was highly correlated with tree topology, allowing us to infer the homology relationships between the trypanosomatid kaps .

in the t. cruzi genome, we were able to identify the kap <dig> and kap <dig> genes, but not the kap <dig> and kap <dig> genes, which were only identified in leishmania spp. and c. fasciculata. furthermore, we were able to identify two other genes that are similar to the cfkaps, herein named kap <dig> and kap <dig>  they have not been characterized in crithidia, as the available sequence information for this genome is limited . the kap <dig> gene whose size is compatible to others kaps, is more related to kap <dig>  and was annotated in all five genomes analyzed as "kinetoplast dna-associated protein". the kap <dig> gene, also present in all trypanosomatid genomes, has been annotated as "hypothetical protein, conserved". although it is clustered with the kap <dig> gene , the lower bootstrap value of this clade reinforces the uncertainty of kap <dig> relationship to other kaps. the kap genes of t. cruzi are present as two copies, with the exception of tckap4c, probably due to the hybrid nature of the cl brener strain  <cit> - .

characterization of tckaps
in this work, we cloned and expressed two kaps in t. cruzi: tckap <dig> and tckap <dig>  the pcr amplification of the tckap4a gene generated a  <dig> bp dna fragment encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the tckap <dig> gene includes 28% basic residues, with a predicted pi of  <dig> . the tckap <dig> gene is  <dig> base pairs long and encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. the amino acid sequence of tckap <dig> includes 30% of basic residues and this protein has a predicted pi of  <dig> . the amino acid sequence data reported here are available from genbank under the accession numbers abr <dig> for tckap <dig> and abr <dig> for tckap <dig>  both tckap <dig> and tckap <dig> have a clearly identifiable cleavable presequence in the n-terminal region similar to that described for the kaps of c. fasciculata and potentially involved in mitochondrial import . these presequences are absent from the mature forms of the proteins in c. fasciculata and with the exception of their length, have all the properties usually associated with cleavable mitochondrial presequences  <cit> . similar sequences have been identified in the c. fasciculata kinetoplast dna polymerase beta, t. brucei hsp <dig> and leishmania tarentolae aldehyde dehydrogenase  <cit> .

as reported for their counterparts in c. fasciculata  <cit> , the tckaps are positively charged and small, consistent with a role in dna charge neutralization and kdna condensation in t. cruzi. the interaction between kaps and kdna may involve nonspecific electrostatic binding to dna, interaction with specific regions of the minicircles or both types of association. however, further studies are required to investigate the occurrence of interaction between tckaps and kdna, and how these interactions determine dna network organization in t. cruzi.

detection of tckaps in the distinct developmental stages of t. cruzi
after cloning and expression, recombinant tckap <dig> and tckap <dig> proteins  were purified in order to produce mouse polyclonal antisera against them. these antisera were used in immunoblotting assays, to analyze the expression of tckaps in proliferative and non proliferative stages of t. cuzi. cell extracts of epimastigotes, amastigotes/intermediate forms and trypomastigotes were used and both antisera were able to detect a single polypeptide in all developmental stages of t. cruzi. the anti-tckap <dig> serum detected a protein with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda  and the anti-tckap <dig> serum detected a protein with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda . the molecular weights observed on sds-page were slightly higher than those expected based on the deduced amino acid sequences of tckap <dig> and tckap <dig>  this difference may result from the basic nature of these proteins.

the kinetoplast ultrastructure in t. cruzi and distribution of tckaps
the tckap antisera were also employed to determine the subcellular location of tckaps in t. cruzi. it is worth mentioning that the kinetoplast of this parasite undergoes morphological changes during the protozoon life cycle; epimastigotes and amastigotes have tightly packed kdna fibers condensed within the kinetoplast disk, whereas trypomastigotes have a more relaxed organization of kdna, which is enclosed in a rounded structure. during the transformation of amastigotes in trypomastigotes inside the mammalian cell, changes occur in the general organization of the protozoa, in special in the kinetoplast structure. the population of intracellular parasites does not differentiate in perfect synchrony, thus at a certain time of the differentiation process, some transitional stages between amastigotes and trypomastigotes can be found in the same cell  <cit> . for this reason, the amastigotes used in our assays, which were released after disruption of llc-mk <dig> cells, were mixed with intermediate forms. the kinetoplast of these intermediate forms is enlarged in relation to the disk observed in amastigotes, presenting the dna fibers densely packed in the central area, but less condensed at the periphery. in order to analyze the distribution of tckaps in all developmental stages of t. cruzi, we carried out immunolabelling assays using tckap antisera in epimastigotes, amastigotes/intermediate forms and trypomastigotes. both antisera specifically recognized the kinetoplast of all developmental stages of t. cruzi . however, the distribution of these proteins within the kinetoplast depended on the developmental form of the parasite. in epimastigotas and amastigotes, tckap <dig> and tckap <dig> were distributed throughout the kdna network , consistent with findings for c. fasciculata, in which cfkaps are distributed for all kinetoplast disk  <cit> . in intermediate forms  and trypomastigotes , tckap <dig> and tckap <dig> were distributed mainly at the periphery of the kdna network. in order to better understand the kdna arrangement present in the intermediate forms and the distribution of kaps in the different developmental stages of t. cruzi, ultrastructural analyses and immunocytochemistry assays were performed . in epimastigotes and amastigotes , which present a disk-shaped kinetoplast, we could observe gold particles distributed throughout the kinetoplast disk when both antisera were used . in intermediate forms, which present an enlarged kinetoplast when compared to the disk-shaped kinetoplast of amastigotes , labeling of tckaps is more intense at the peripheral region than in the central area . in trypomastigotes, which present a round-shaped kinetoplast , gold particles were mainly observed at the periphery of the kinetoplast network , confirming the results obtained by immunofluorescence analysis. preliminary cytochemical studies had already shown different distributions of basic proteins in the kinetoplasts of the different developmental stages of t. cruzi  <cit> . however, the reason for this differential protein distribution remain unclear. it is possible that these basic proteins are involved in topological rearrangements of the kdna network during the t. cruzi life cycle, in which the compact bar-shaped kinetoplast is converted into a globular structure. however, no data are currently available to confirm or refute this hypothesis.

in this work we showed for the first time that the distribution of tckaps in different developmental stages of t. cruzi is related to the kinetoplast format: in disk-shaped structures, like those found in epimastigotes and amastigotes, proteins are seen dispersed through the kdna network. conversely, in intermediate and rounded kinetoplasts, like those observed in intermediate forms and trypomastigotes, kaps are mainly located at the kdna periphery. taken together, these data indicate that the kdna rearrangement that takes place during the t. cruzi differentiation process, is accompanied by tckap <dig> and tckap <dig> redistribution within the kinetoplast. it means that tckaps could determine, at least in part, the distinct topological organization of the kdna networks.

although much information is available concerning the kinetoplast-associated proteins in c. fasciculata, it is still unknown how kaps and other proteins interact with the dna molecules to condense and determine the tridimensional arrangement of the kdna network in trypanosomatids. further studies using gene knockout to inhibit the expression of kaps or assays to over-express these proteins, would help us understand the biological function of tckaps in t. cruzi and their involvement  in the topological rearrangements of kdna during the parasite morphogenetic development.

CONCLUSIONS
tckaps are candidate proteins for kdna packaging and organization in t. cruzi. the trypanosomatid genomes sequenced to date have several sequences that share some degree of similarity with cfkaps studied so far . we have organized these sequences according to coding and syntenic information and have identified two potentially novel kaps in these organisms, kap <dig> and kap <dig>  additionally, we have characterized two kaps in t. cruzi, tckap <dig> and tckap <dig>  which are small and basic proteins that are expressed in proliferative and non-proliferative stages of the parasite. tckaps present differential distribution within the kinetoplasts of epimastigotes, amastigotes, intermediate forms and trypomastigotes, indicating that the kdna rearrangement that takes place during the t. cruzi differentiation process is accompanied by tckaps redistribution.
