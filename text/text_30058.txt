BACKGROUND
large-scale genome rearrangements, such as translocations, inversions and deletions of chromosomal regions several megabases in length, are characteristic of the genomic instability observed in many different human disease states. for example, jumping translocations often result in tumor-specific chromosome imbalances that are associated with oncogenesis in leukemia  <cit>  and solid tumors  <cit> . in addition to an association with instability manifest in disease, large-scale rearrangements account for much of the karyotypic diversity observed among species . while genome instability and chromosome heterozygosity are often the immediate results of such genomic change  <cit> , propagation in the germ line and subsequent fixation leading to species-specific karyotypes are also potential outcomes  <cit> . each of these specific rearrangements, interchromosomal translocations, deletions or intrachromosomal inversions, requires double stranded breaks. however, the genetic sequences associated with, and mechanisms responsible for, these breaks and rearrangements are not well understood. tracking these chromosomal rearrangements in both species evolution and disease progression has led to a better understanding of the trajectory and character of chromosome segments during periods of instability.

nadeau and taylor  <cit>  proposed that chromosomal breaks associated with rearrangements occurred at random points in the genome. this view has changed as comparative analyses using phylogenetic inference have been performed on the whole-genome sequence data available for several mammalian taxa  <cit> . these genome-wide analyses show that there are many regions, or fragile sites, that are prone to breakage distributed nonrandomly in the mammalian genome  <cit> . many of these fragile sites are conserved between human and mouse  <cit>  and among such diverse species as rat, cattle, dog, pig, cat, and horse  <cit>  whose evolutionary history spans  <dig> million years  <cit> . these data indicate that breakpoint reuse occurs at specific sites in the genome . such genome-scale comparisons show that the fragile regions in one species are often centromeres and/or telomeres at the orthologous region of another species  <cit> .

recent studies of the evolutionary trajectory of orthologous chromosome segments in metatherian lineages  show that ebs often coincide with latent centromeres, locations in the genome that are predisposed to centromere activity  <cit> . while both the metatherian  <cit>  and eutherian  <cit>  data suggest an association between ebs and centromeres across diverse vertebrate lineages, it is unknown whether specific sequence motifs are common at both ebs and centromere domains that may indicate shared function. moreover, common and/or conserved sequence motifs between orthologous ebs shared between eutherian and metatherian lineages have not been previously examined. this study uses sequence data from the tammar wallaby, macropus eugenii, in the context of the kangaroo karyotypic divergence, and from human in the context of primate karyotypic evolution, to explore the possible relationship between these two distinct genomic regions that share a common predisposition to both instability and centromere formation/activity. we hypothesize that active centromeres and ebs identified as latent centromeres are characterized by distinct repeat patterns that are retained during genome restructuring events and that these patterns are a conserved feature of mammalian genomes. using fluorescence in situ hybridization, clone contig assembly, sequence annotation and repeat analyses, we have examined sequence from a conserved eb that has been reused multiple times in the derivation of divergent species karyotypes within the marsupial lineage . these data were compared to genome sequence from centromeric regions  and euchromatic regions  for conserved features that might indicate a structural and/or functional link among these chromosome domains. in addition, the region of the human genome orthologous to the meu1q eb was identified as an eb and further analyzed to determine whether specific sequences and/or sequence classes are conserved between metatherian and eutherian lineages during genome reorganization.

here we report that a high concentration of erv and l <dig> elements is shared at centromeres and an eb in the tammar wallaby, as well as at the orthologous eb in human. these results show that the presence of these specific classes of repeat elements are 1) shared at eb that are derived from centromeres, and 2) are conserved at these eb over  <dig> million years of evolution, despite replenishment with lineage-specific elements. therefore, the concentration of these elements at eb and centromeres may be a contributing factor to the karyotypic instability these genomic locations have retained.

RESULTS
karyotypically defined regions of the tammar wallaby genome
previous studies have shown that junctions  between conserved chromosome segments in the tammar wallaby  karyotype, as defined by reciprocal chromosome painting  <cit> , carry the kangaroo endogenous retrovirus, kerv  <cit> . in an effort to expand on the previous breakpoint map, a tammar wallaby bacterial artificial chromosome  library was screened with the gag open reading frame of kerv  <cit> . from this screen,  <dig> kerv-containing clones were selected and mapped to metaphase chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization . of the clones examined, 100% mapped to regions recognized as ebs between conserved chromosome segments or active centromere regions  within the macropididae lineage  <cit> .

from these kerv-containing clones, three different subsets  were selected for finished sequencing and analysis as representatives of specific chromosome regions in the tammar wallaby genome. these include those from a conserved eb, active centromeres  and euchromatic regions  not involved in karyotypic rearrangements in marsupials . the cen locations used in this study are pericentric; however, the pericentric regions within this species are small, with the entire centromere regions spanning only ~ <dig> kb  <cit> . thus, we refer to these clones as centromeric, fully aware that they likely encompass these small pericentric regions. three clones  localize to tammar chromosome 1q , a region identified as a major eb within the marsupial lineage and an active centromere in monodelphis domestica , trichosurus vulpecula , and aepyprymnus rufescens  . none of these three eb bacs form a contiguous sequence . three clones  localize to cen regions of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . two clones analyzed  localize to interstitial eu regions that are not defined ebs nor latent centromeres  <cit>  within the marsupial karyotype. a <dig> localizes to a region adjacent to the eb on tammar chromosome 1q while j <dig> localizes to the middle of 6p . an additional ten bacs previously mapped to the genomic region encompassing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene  in tammar wallaby  <cit>  were added to the pool of eu bac sequences used in these analyses. this region was chosen as it is the only other region of the tammar wallaby that has been fully annotated to date.

eu, cen and eb sequences were analyzed for interspersed repeat content and predicted coding regions and the bacs isolated herein were fully annotated for lines, sines, satellites, dna transposons, rte elements, endogenous retroviruses , ltr retrotransposons, cr1s, non-ltrs, simple repeats and predicted exons. full annotations for bacs not previously described  <cit>  are shown in figure  <dig>  comparison of the relative nucleotide content of the three genomic regions indicates a homogenous distribution with no single nucleotide being more than a fraction of a percent different across these regions. the relative gc content is also uniform across all three regions . all the identified bacs were analyzed for possible contigs among them using both multipipmaker and codon code aligner software. no contigs were identified. in addition, it is apparent from the annotation of these bacs  that they do not form a contiguous sequence.

enrichment of lines and ervs at tammar wallaby eb and cen regions
the most striking differences between tammar eu compared with eb and cen regions are the number and types of repeat elements found as predicted by repbase's censor  <cit> . the total repeat content varies significantly but expectedly, with eu having the fewest repeats . interestingly, the eb carries an even greater number of repeats than the cen regions,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . a total of  <dig> different types of repeats were identified. while the abundance of most of these classes  did not vary significantly, there are many  that did .

both the cen and eb regions have many repeat types in common, most notably a significant enrichment of both endogenous retroviruses  and line1s  while being relatively devoid of sines . this is also visually apparent in the annotation of these sequences . the total l <dig> average for each region is  <dig> % at the eb,  <dig> % in the cen and only  <dig> % in the eu region . some classes of l1s are nearly exclusively found in the eb  but represent the minority of this general class. two of the most abundant l1s  are found in all three regions but differ in copy number considerably with the majority found in the eb, averaging roughly  <dig>  elements per  <dig> kb . this is significantly more than the  <dig>  elements per  <dig> kb found in the cen regions and significantly more than the  <dig>  per  <dig> kb in the eu .

of the  <dig> l <dig> elements  with 90% or greater identity to their consensus sequences, 63%  are found in the  <dig> kb derived solely from the eb and cen regions . to further refine this apparent region bias, repeats 95% or more of their consensus length were identified as intact and further quantified. the number of repeats was normalized for discrepancies in region size among eb, cen, and eu by estimating the number of intact elements for every  <dig> kb . intact l1s were primarily found within the eb region with almost  <dig>  elements for every  <dig> kb. there were far fewer in the cen  and eu  regions. these observations suggest that the eb is enriched for intact l1s that have likely been very recently active and may contribute to the instability of this region.

content variation between these three genomic domains was not restricted to lines. ervs make up  <dig> % of the eb region and  <dig> % of the cen compared to  <dig> % in the eu region . the eb contains a wider variety of viral elements than the cen regions. the most conserved and abundant erv in both regions is the virus mervk1-i as identified by censor. this element is of particular interest because it is in fact a mis-annotated kerv sequence, the virus sequence used in the initial bac screens and previously identified  <cit> . mervk1-i is only a portion of the complete kerv- <dig> sequence . repbase also identifies solo kerv-ltr sequences . there are an average of  <dig>  kerv and  <dig>  kerv solo ltr sequences found in each  <dig> kb of the eb. the cen regions contain  <dig>  copies  of both kerv and kerv ltrs while the eu regions contain only  <dig>  copies  of kerv ltrs and no non-ltr kerv sequence . there is a general enrichment of many different ervs in both the eb and cen regions  with kerv being the most abundant and conserved and the only erv present in its full length.

the euchromatic  regions, while being relatively devoid of ervs and l1s contain an average number of repeats , on par with estimates of human repeat content of  <dig> % and slightly higher than previous estimates for the tammar wallaby of  <dig> %  <cit> . the most common repeat class found in the eu regions are the short interspersed nuclear elements , comprising  <dig> %, and the non-ltr retrotransposon cr1s that make up approximately  <dig> %. this varies dramatically from the eb at  <dig> % sines and  <dig> % cr1s and the cen regions at  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . the sine content of the cen regions, while not as dramatically different from eb and eu regions as for ervs, carries a sine content midway between eu and eb; however, the cen sine content is still significantly different from either eu or eb . full-length copies of sines are also more frequently found in the eu . the cr <dig> content when averaged appears very different in the eb compared to the eu but only has a p-value =  <dig>  due to the disparate distribution of this class on the three bacs analyzed. dna transposons are more prevalent in the eu  than the eb  and cen . one exception to this is the dna transposon charlie1b from the hat class of repeats which is almost exclusively limited to the cen regions .

ruiz-herrera et al  have shown the reuse of eb between species as well as a correlation between fragile sites and tandem repeats within these locations  <cit> . we have found more simple repeats  at the cen regions than either eu or eb and, interestingly, the fewest at the eb .

this analysis shows a general enrichment of ervs and l1s at both a conserved eb and centromeric regions of the tammar wallaby genome. more specifically, we have shown that the l <dig> elements, l1-3_me and l1-3a_me, as well as the endogenous retrovirus kerv and its solo-ltrs are both more abundant and more intact at the eb and cen compared to the genic regions  examined.

conserved evolutionary breakpoint between tammar wallaby 1q and human 14q <dig> 
to examine these regions further, the sequences of the  <dig> bacs  were examined for possible protein coding regions. the sequences were masked of repeats and analyzed with the two gene prediction programs, genscan and genemark.hmm-e. predicted coding regions were analyzed using the blastn, blastx  and blat  analysis programs . coding regions were predicted in each of the three chromosomal domains  at approximately equal frequencies. none of the predictions in the cen region were identifiable as known coding regions. conversely, both the eb and eu contain predicted coding regions with some sequence identity, at least at the protein level, for known genes .

interestingly, the eu bac a <dig> carries a predicted gene with high nucleotide homology  to the human gene transmembrane protein  <dig>  . tmem <dig> is located on human 14q <dig>  approximately  <dig> mb upstream from the immunoglobulin heavy chain  region, which has been involved in translocations in multiple myelomas and plasma cell leukemias  <cit> . human 14q <dig>  has also been identified as an eb  <cit> . the localization of a <dig> adjacent to the 1q eb clones and the activity of igh in human cancer compelled a closer examination of the igh orthologous locus in human with respect to conserved features.

the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus is approximately  <dig>  mb on human chromosome  <dig> and consists of both a constant and variable region  <cit> . the ighv region is the most distal  <dig> mb of human 14q, the assembled bac contig of which consists of  <dig> clones. sequence alignments using multipipmaker with repeats masked were performed comparing each tammar eb clone  with clone sequences used in the assembly of human chromosome 14q <dig>   <cit> , spanning ighv to tmem <dig>  while there was no identity between these segments and i <dig>  or b <dig>  several regions of the eb clone g <dig> had significant alignment across the terminal segments of 14q <dig> , representing only the ighv region . each of these g <dig> sequences showed significant identity to the ighv region of many species including human, mouse, chimp and opossum . the alignments with tammar g <dig> were of sufficient length and nucleotide identity to identify it as orthologous to the ighv region. these alignments at first glance appear disrupted but when examined in the context of the repeats in this region as determined by our annotations , it is clear that the orthologous regions fall between the repeats . in addition, the alignments of g <dig> to five different, contiguous clones from human 14q <dig>   are indicative of the segmental duplications this region of human chromosome  <dig> has experienced  <cit> . it is not known at this time, however, whether segmental duplications are a shared feature between this region of the human genome and the tammar eb region given the lack of full, contiguous sequence for this region of the tammar genome.

assemblies of bacs for the tammar wallaby across a region orthologous to approximately  <dig> mb upstream from tmem <dig> on human 14q are publicly available . two clones  from this contig were localized to tammar wallaby metaphase chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization to verify orthology. both clones hybridized to tammar 1q and verify this region of 1q as orthologous to human 14q . while g <dig> and a <dig> align to the human contig for 14q <dig>  , the other two tammar eb clones  had no significant identity with the igh locus. it is likely these bacs lie distal to the break and are not represented in human 14q, however the resolution of metaphase fish did not allow for a finer map location with respect to the 14q orthologous region.

enrichment of lines and ervs at human 14q32
given the orthology between the 1q eb in the tammar wallaby and human 14q <dig>  we tested whether the observed enrichment of specific repeats was conserved in divergent mammalian lineages. our data shows that this breakpoint represents an eb that has been conserved at least since the last shared common ancestor of the eutherian and metatherian lineages, approximately 147mya  <cit> . moreover, this is an eb that is still unstable in humans in that it is a fragile site that undergoes rearrangement during disease progression  <cit>  and has been observed to form a neocentromere  <cit> . across human 14q <dig>  are regions orthologous to both eb and eu regions within tammar.

the pattern of repeats in human14q <dig>  mirrors that observed between the eu and eb regions of tammar wallaby . from tmem <dig> to just before the igh constant region , the region orthologous to the tammar eu represented by bac a <dig>  there is an abundance of sine elements and relative paucity of both line1s and ervs. the human sequence beginning at ighc and continuing to the end of this region  shows a dramatic increase in line <dig> and erv content and a drastic decrease in sines, analogous to that observed for the tammar eb.

we have examined the repetitive elements across the cytological band 14q <dig>  to determine if this distribution represents an expansion of a small group of repeats or an enrichment or absence of the particular repeat classes in general. we found that where there was an abundance of an element class it reflected an increase in diversity as well as number . for instance, the number of ervs and line1s dramatically increases, as does the diversity of those element types, with approximately  <dig> different ervs and almost  <dig> different line1s identified in the most distal portion of 14q <dig>   and less than  <dig> of each type identified in the more proximal region  . the reverse is true for sines with as many as  <dig> varieties in the eu region compared to as few as  <dig> in the eb . dna transposons, despite the fact that their quantity did not vary significantly, carry a diversity across the region resembling that of sines. this observed diversity is even more pronounced with up to  <dig> types in the eu compared to  <dig> or less in the eb . cr <dig> diversity  had slightly more variety in the eu than the eb, though this may or may not be significant as there are only  <dig> different cr1s throughout the region as classified by censor. simple repeats were not included in this portion of the analysis as they are too varied to easily group and analyze.

interestingly, the erv <dig> class of endogenous retroviruses  was found almost exclusively at the igh region of 14q <dig>  . all of the members found belong to the hervk class of ervs. hervks are phylogenetically related to mouse mammary tumor viruses  in mice  <cit> ; kerv has been shown to be most closely related to this group  <cit> .

human 14q <dig>  is found at the telomere end of human chromosome  <dig>  to determine if this repeat pattern is a feature of telomeric regions rather than that of ebs, two human telomeres not previously identified as ebs  <cit>  were chosen at random  and a repeat analysis was performed on the most distal  <dig> mb of each. the dramatic enrichment for line <dig> and ervs was not observed for either telomere . a similar analysis was performed on the igh region of the south american opossum  . though a similar trend is seen we were unable to determine statistical significance due to many large gaps in the m. domesticus assembly. however, there is a very dramatic enrichment of l1s and ervs across the entire  <dig> mb examined including the igh region.

discussion
the recent availability of large amounts of genome sequence from diverse taxa has allowed for high-resolution mapping of syntenic chromosomal segment order in efforts to understand the evolutionary trajectory of specific genomic regions. murphy et al  <cit>  examined orthologous genomic sequences of syntenic blocks among a broad array of eutherian species and found that breakpoint locations are often reused between divergent species and that these sites strongly correlated with centromere locations in several species. ruiz-herrera et al  <cit>  examined the murphy et al. dataset and found that not only is there a link between breakpoints and centromeres in karyotype evolution, but ebs also coincide with fragile sites and chromosomal breakpoints identified in human cancers  <cit> . these studies suggested that ebs might continue to carry "signals" of both past breakpoint activity as well as a propensity for further instability under cellular stress; however, these studies did not examine eb sequences in a phylogenetic context.

more recently, mapping the trajectory of chromosome segments along species phylogenies in marsupial lineages has shown that breakpoint reuse often coincides with centromere emergence  <cit> , lending support to the hypothesis that eb serve as latent centromeres  <cit> . thus, we can predict that the ebs characterized as latent centromeres might retain common sequence features between divergent taxa. marsupialia offers an ideal system to study genomic rearrangements and breakpoint reuse; this infraclass represents one of the most well characterized mammalian lineages with respect to chromosome arrangement. over 70% of extant species have been karyotyped  and the chromosome trajectories of many families, genera and species have been determined . with comparatively little marsupial sequence data available, cross-species reciprocal chromosome painting has been effectively used to delineate conserved chromosome segments  and to identify convergent breakpoint reuse  <cit> .

our study utilizes a comparative sequencing approach to test the hypothesis that ebs and cen share specific sequence features and that such features are retained during periods of genomic instability and species evolution. we have identified specific interspersed repeats, endogenous retroviruses  and long interspersed nuclear elements , enriched in ebs and cen. these particular groups of repetitive elements  are also found at several breaks of synteny between human and gibbon  <cit>  as well as two breakpoints examined between human and chimp  <cit> . we also show that the interspersed repeat distribution of cens and ebs differs dramatically compared to that of a previously analyzed euchromatic region   <cit> . in human tumor cell lines, chromosome  <dig> shows regions of recurrent instability. the distribution of repeats at these loci has a very similar increase of both l <dig> and erv elements  <cit> .

through bac mapping and comparative sequence analyses, we show that the eb on tammar 1q is orthologous to human 14q <dig> . this locus has been identified as an eb  <cit> , is known to undergo translocations associated with cancer  <cit> , and has been identified as a neocentromere  <cit> . we have analyzed repeat content of the tammar eb and surrounding eu and compared them to the repeat distribution of the orthologous human region, 14q <dig> , including the immunoglobulin heavy chain region . as in tammar, the human orthologous eb carries a significant enrichment of ervs and l1s, with frequencies of both sequences similar to that observed for tammar cen. these data suggest that repeat content defines distinct chromosome domains and is a conserved feature of mammalian genomes. moreover, cen and ebs are enriched for both ancient erv and recent l <dig> activity, indicating these regional domains, and subsequent instability that manifests as chromosome rearrangement or centric shifts, is directly linked to the activity of mobile dna. it is worth noting that the primary satellite sequence found in the cetacea is derived from an ancestral mammalian l <dig> element  <cit> .

the enrichment of ervs, and specifically herv-k retrotransposons, in 14q <dig>  is of particular interest given that this class contains primate specific lineages of elements and thus must be recently derived. herv-k retroviruses consist of  <dig> different families of human mmtv-like elements, denoted as hmls 1– <dig>  <cit> . some of these families, such as hml- <dig>  are characterized by recent activity in the genome and contain intact open reading frames  that encode functional proteins  <cit> , while other families, such as hml- <dig> and hml- <dig>  have not been active for tens of millions of years  <cit> . the prominent element in the human breakpoint examined is denoted in repbase as herv-k <dig>  an hml- <dig> element  <cit> . last active prior to the split of old world and new world primates, this element would have integrated into this location long before hominoid divergence, and thus has been retained despite breakpoint activity in this region. moreover, the integration of an hml- <dig> member in this region parallels an integration of another ancient herv-k related element, kerv, in the orthologous region within the metatherian lineage .

kerv, while ancient in origin, has retained a cellular function in active centromeres through recruitment of specific centromere proteins and production of novel small rnas in marsupial and eutherian lineages  <cit> . likewise, transcription of herv-k  <cit>  elements has also been retained, although functional coding sequences for either class of elements have not been identified nor has any involvement with cellular function been examined. thus, not only is there a tight correlation between ebs and cen as regional domains involved in genome rearrangement, instability and karyotypic evolution, there is a tight correlation between specific sequences found in these regions . two scenarios may explain the presence of these elements at orthologous eb: either herv-k replaced kerv elements within a eutherian ancestor at the region orthologous to 14q <dig> , or the kerv and herv-k elements independently integrated into orthologous eb. understanding the integration preference sites for each respective class may shed light on the order of integration events.

given the predisposition of the eb on meu1q and hsa14q <dig>  for continuous rearrangement through double-strand breaks and enc formation within both marsupials and humans, the coincidence of specific classes of retroelements at these regions implies they may be integral to the underlying mechanism for prolonged instability. a recent study of double-strand repair mechanisms in yeast showed that those breaks that give rise to chromosome aberrations were repaired by homologous recombination  between nonallelic ty retrotransposons  <cit> . in light of the finding that hr between nonallelic repeat elements contributed to a large portion of the structural variation in the human genome  <cit> , it is intriguing to consider that sustained activity of retroelements, not necessarily through transposition, but rather through an inherent propensity for hr between elements at distant genomic locations may contribute to both the evolutionary novelty of the genome but also to its innate instability.

CONCLUSIONS
with many genome assemblies available, it is clear that breakpoints in the genome are nonrandomly distributed, frequently reused in karyotypic evolution and often involved in diverse disease states. phylogenetic analyses of whole genome sequence has shown that breakpoints are frequently the location of ancient centromeres and novel centromere formation  <cit> . our study examines the relationship between evolutionary breakpoints and centromeres in the tammar wallaby, macropus eugenii. we have examined sequence from a breakpoint  that has been reused throughout the karyotypic diversification of the marsupialia. these data were compared to sequence from three centromeres  and a euchromatic coding region. we hypothesized that breakpoints would resemble centromeres in genomic content given the prevalence for centromeres to occur at conserved breakpoints in marsupials and found this to be the case; both regions carried a statistically significant enrichment of certain erv and l <dig> elements. furthermore, we extended our study and examined the human ortholog of the tammar breakpoint, hsa14q <dig> . this locus has been known to be involved in translocations in many diseases, including multiple myelomas and plasma cell leukemias. moreover, a neocentromere has also been described at this region. our analysis of the human ortholog shows a drastic increase in the number of l1s and ervs and a depletion of sine elements, sequence features conserved at the tammar breakpoint and centromeres. our results show these sequence classes have been retained at this region since the divergence of marsupial and eutherian mammals despite replenishment with lineage-specific elements. thus, continued activity of these classes of elements may contribute to the instability observed at these locations and may serve as an indicator of centromere potential.
