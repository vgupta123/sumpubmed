BACKGROUND
feeds used in modern atlantic salmon aquaculture contain large amounts of lipids, which provide rapid growth, reduce environmental load from farms, but increase visceral fat deposition  <cit> . very little is, however, known about the factors regulating development and functions of adipose tissue in fish, and whether increased fat deposition may lead to health problems. previously regarded principally as energy storage, white adipose tissue  in mammals is now recognized as a highly active endocrine tissue producing numerous secretory proteins, including adipokines, a suite of small signalling proteins specifically produced in wat  <cit> . under normal conditions, adipocytes are involved in the regulation of a broad range of physiological processes but at obesity increased production of cytokines and adipokines lead to the chronic low-grade inflammatory state. the extent of conservation of endocrine wat functions in the cold-blooded vertebrate, including its capacity to influence systemic inflammatory responses and development of life style related disorders has not been studied until now.

in salmonid fish, precursor cells differentiate into adipocytes continuously  <cit> , however, the exact origin of preadipocytes is not known. in mammals, development of white adipocytes is thought to begin with progenitor cells from the perivascular compartment  in wat, characterised by expression of smooth muscle actin 22α, also known as transgelin , and other vascular markers. isolated pericytes differentiate into mesenchymal stem cells , which in turn, give rise to various cell types including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes  <cit> . mammalian adipose stromal-vascular fraction  harbours a population of progenitor cells that is also capable to differentiate ex vivo into cells and tissues of mesodermal origin, thus suggesting their perivascular origin. atlantic salmon wat contains a large number of fibroblast-like precursor cells that can differentiate to mature adipocytes in vitro  <cit> , however, their stem cell features have not been characterized yet.

in mammals, adipogenesis includes three distinct stages. following active proliferation and the phase of determination, cells reach confluence, followed by hormonal induction and terminal differentiation. re-entry into the cell cycle of growth-arrested cells at confluence involves several rounds of proliferation, referred to as mitotic clonal expansion. secondary growth arrest and induction of the transcription factors ccaat-enhancer-binding protein  α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  γ mark the end of the mitotic clonal expansion phase and entry into terminal differentiation with transcriptional activation of genes defining the mature adipocyte phenotype.

the few performed studies indicate that adipogenesis in fish bears many resemblances to that of terrestrial vertebrates  <cit> , though there certainly exist as yet undiscovered species-specific differences. atlantic salmon precursor cells take longer than mammalian to acquire the mature adipocyte phenotype in culture, due to low incubating temperature, typical of salmonid fish habitat. further, mammalian cells are able to produce lipid droplets  from glucose alone, while salmon preadipocytes require lipids in order to achieve the mature phenotype  <cit> . hence it is to be expected that white adipocytes and their precursors in a cold-blooded vertebrate may have both evolutionarily conserved and specific features.

the asvf primary culture enabled investigation of early events involved in the adipogenic determination as well as processes characteristic of the later terminal differentiation phase. particular emphasis was placed on genes governing nutrient metabolism and stress and inflammatory responses.

RESULTS
cell culture characterization
a short summary of adipocyte development and cultivation conditions is presented in fig.  <dig>  in the subconfluent stage during the first seven days of culture, asvf cells had the highest proliferative activity . approximately at day  <dig>  cells reached the confluent stage. two-day adipogenic hormonal induction was applied at that time point. this was followed by the terminal differentiation stage during which cells acquired a more rounded shape. morphological changes observed by electron microscopy images at days  <dig> and  <dig> were characteristic of the terminally differentiating phenotype of adipocytes, including a relatively low mitochondrial number, large size of ld and the nucleus located between lds and cell membrane . oil red o staining also showed a high degree of lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes at day  <dig> . a steady decrease in the extracellular superoxide dismutase  activity was observed from day  <dig> to day  <dig> .

subconfluence 
microarray analyses of asvf in the first days of culture, revealed concurrent expression of genes characteristic of mscs, immune cells and cells of perivascular origin . platelet-derived growth factor a  is a major regulator of proliferation and migration of mammalian adipose-derived mscs  <cit> . glomulin is essential for normal development of the vasculature while the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor  <dig>  is a marker of lymph vessels and endothelial cells in mammals. chemokine receptor  <dig>  and other chemokine/cytokine receptors are involved in cell mobilisation and retention in several populations of mscs and in immune cells  <cit> . we have selected eight co-expressed genes encoding proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism, dna replication and regulation of cell cycle and their averaged profile, due to their involvement in the similar cellular functions, was shown in fig. 2b. the lowest expression of genes from this category was at day  <dig> . the subsequent increase was in concordance with the results of proliferating cell nuclear antigen  assay that revealed the highest proliferation rate at day  <dig> . in parallel, microarray analyses showed a decreased expression of non-adipogenic cell markers. these genes had high levels at day  <dig> . tumour necrosis factor  α, a proinflammatory cytokine and a potent negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation in terrestrial vertebrates, was up-regulated before confluence as well as a panel of tnf-related genes and receptors . we observed up-regulation of pparγ already at day  <dig> . this is the master regulator that co-ordinately activates transcription of adipocyte-specific genes  <cit> .

confluence  and hormonal induction 
cells reached confluence at day  <dig>  up-regulation of retinoblastoma-like protein  <dig>  and p53-like protein  was in concordance with the temporary cell cycle arrest at g0/g <dig>  which is commonly observed at this stage in most mammalian cell lines. after stimulation with hormones, cells re-enter the cell cycle and undergo mitotic clonal expansion before ultimate exit from the cell cycle. at day  <dig>  expression of rbl <dig> and p53-like protein decreased while cyclins e <dig> and b <dig> were stimulated. two days after addition of the differentiation media, cells changed to a more rounded shape. this coincided with the up-regulation of a suite of motor contractile proteins . interestingly, microarray showed elevated expression of tagln at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  tagln is a marker of pericytes, smooth muscle-like cells surrounding vasculature, that are closely related to the mscs and fibroblasts  <cit> . positive and negative regulators of myogenic differentiation showed opposite changes: decrease in myogenic factor d  and increase in bone morphogenic protein  <dig>  . we also observed up-regulation of several genes for ca2+ binding proteins . calcium is involved in the control of the whole adipogenic process, from multipotent stem cells to adipocytes  <cit> . increases in cytoplasmic calcium during this phase inhibit adipogenesis  <cit> . days  <dig> and  <dig> were marked by the expression changes of c/ebps. the early adipogenic marker c/ebpβ, was up-regulated until confluence, whereas transient induction of c/ebpδ and consistent increase of c/ebpα were observed after the addition of hormones at day  <dig> . overall, c/ebpβ and c/ebpδ work sequentially and predate the expression of c/ebpα  <cit> . we observed different expression changes in a number of genes encoding chemokines and cytokines. the leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin  <dig>  was re-activated at day  <dig> and remained up-regulated until the end of the study period . lect <dig> is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, which also affects development of chondrocytes and osteoblasts  <cit> . in contrast, tnfα and related genes were down-regulated .

terminal differentiation and the late phase of white adipocyte maturation 
the increase in intracellular lipid levels measured by oil red o  was in line with the up-regulation of genes for several proteins of lipid metabolism , including lipoprotein lipase  . the expression of fatty acid synthase  was highest from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  in agreement with the profile of fas observed in murine adipocytes  <cit> . metabolic alterations were also supported by the regulation of key genes from major carbohydrate pathways . glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  from the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway  were up-regulated from day  <dig> to the end of adipogenic differentiation indicating increased need for nadph that is required for tag biosynthesis. to synthesise nucleotides, cells need large amounts of ribose-5-phosphate . the ppp uses glucose to provide r5p and nadph, however, the output can be modified according to the cells' current needs, towards the production of either one of the products. the increase of phosphofructokinase  and pyruvate kinase  expression from day  <dig> could be an evidence for the importance of glycolysis in tag-accumulating adipocytes. in addition to glycolysis and contrary to what was earlier believed, adipocytes seem to be able to use alternative means  to produce glycerol-3-phosphate  needed for tag synthesis  <cit> . two key glyceroneogenic enzymes, cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase  and cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  were also up-regulated during terminal differentiation. these changes did not necessarily mean a switch to anaerobic metabolism. microarray analyses revealed a decrease of hypoxia inducible factor  while the negative regulator of hif1α  was induced .

day  <dig> was marked with the expression changes of genes involved in differentiation and cell cycle. increase was observed in the anti-osteogenic  <cit>  growth arrest specific protein  <dig>  and adipogenic markers adipsin and visfatin . the up-regulations of rbl <dig>  p53-like protein and growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible  γ were in concordance with the marked attenuation of cell proliferation. interestingly, many immune-related genes exhibited sustained up-regulations, which began shortly before or at the onset of terminal differentiation . programmed death ligand  <dig>  is involved in the blockage of cell cycle in t-cells  <cit> . the up-regulation of decoy receptor interleukin   <dig> receptor alpha  <dig>  implies suppression of the anti-inflammatory il4/il <dig> axis  <cit> . janus kinase  <dig>  and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein  play pivotal roles in respectively, cytokine receptor signalling and biosynthesis of eicosanoids . galectins  are carbohydrate binding proteins involved in various immune processes  <cit> . notably, expression of a panel of immune genes decreased by day  <dig> 

the most noticeable aspect of the last stage of adipogenesis was co-ordinated activation of genes involved in various stress responses. several components of the activator protein complex  <dig>  , which co-ordinates responses to pathogens and stressors, showed highest expression levels at day  <dig> . the observed gene expression changes clearly revealed the endoplasmic reticulum  stress in our culture at this stage. the up-regulated oxidant stress-activated serine/threonine kinase  <dig>  is a golgi complex-associated regulator of transport of proteins and lipids to plasma membrane  <cit> . the a-kinase anchor protein  <dig>  is an essential mediator in lipolytic pathways and is necessary for the maintenance of golgi structure through interactions with signalling proteins, including the protein kinase n ; both akap <dig> and pkn <dig> showed strong down-regulation at day  <dig> . the er stress response involves a set of mechanisms referred to as unfolded protein response   <cit> . the classical upr markers x-box-binding protein  <dig>  and activating transcription factor  <dig>  were up-regulated during the lipid-loading phase of adipogenesis . our findings point to the increased responses to oxidative stress with time. the glutathione peroxidases  , which are sensitive to lipid mediated peroxidation  <cit> , were similarly induced and a suite of genes coding for proteins of glutathione metabolism also had high levels, at the time when cells engaged in increased ld formation and expansion. the thioredoxin  antioxidant system is also involved in the regulation of intracellular ros  <cit> . the production of ros is catalyzed with iron and hem, therefore, the up-regulation of ferritin , and two key enzymes in the metabolism of hem, aminolevulinate δ synthetase and heme oxygenase  <dig>  suggest the induction of mechanisms that protect against oxidative stress at day  <dig> 

the massive down-regulation of components of the translational machinery and translation initiation factors suggested reduction of ribosomal biogenesis and attenuation of protein translation while the highest expression level of 18s at day  <dig> suggested profound changes in the composition of ribosomes during terminal differentiation . averaged expression profiles of thirty five highly co-expressed ribosomal proteins, components of the 40s and 60s ribosomal subunits, were shown in fig.  <dig>  interestingly, eukaryotic initiation translation factor  <dig>  involved in the joining of ribosomal subunits resulting in the formation of a functional 80s initiation complex was up-regulated at the last time point .

the increase of several protein folding heat shock proteins and genes involved in protein degradation was evident during this period . the components of the 26s proteasome, ubiquitin and several enzymes involved in the ubiquitin conjugation to target proteins were up-regulated at day  <dig> and even more markedly at the end of the study period. high levels of 26s proteasome non-atpase regulatory subunit  <dig> , were observed at day  <dig> while up-regulation of lysosomal proteases  was seen from day  <dig> .

discussion
our transcriptomic analyses suggest, as expected, that early salmon asvf culture contains a number of cell types, including vascular cells, macrophages and lymphocytes, in addition to preadipocytes. similar cell composition of asvf was reported in mammals  <cit> . the gene expression profiles at days  <dig> and  <dig> implied retention of multipotency of asvf cells during the early stages of the culture. decrease in gene expression of markers of osteo/chondrogenic, myogenic, immune and vasculature cell lineages  and increase in adipogenic markers indicate that the preadipocyte precursors, probably due to their active proliferation, become the preponderant cell type at confluence.

recent studies in mammals showed that tissue-resident mscs originate from the smooth-muscle-like pericytes  <cit> , which are laid over junctions of endothelial cells in blood vessel walls  <cit> . once liberated from the endothelial cell, pericyte is activated and can be considered a stem cell  <cit> . characterisics of the wat population of stem cells and early events in the determination phase are much less studied than the terminal differentiation phase of adipogenesis. the breakthrough in the understanding of elusive origins of the adipogenic mscs was made only recently in a study of tang et al.  <cit> , which demonstrated that pericytes surrounding blood vessel walls in wat are precursor cells of preadipocytes. gradual attenuation of the vasculature specific genes glomulin and live <dig> and increase of the pericytic marker tagln at days  <dig> and  <dig> support perivascular origin of salmon preadipocytes as well. early pparγ expression could represent an additional evidence of the pericytic identity of adipocytes' precursors in our model since tang et al. confirmed pparγ as a specific marker of the perivascular fraction in subconfluent asvf  <cit> . indeed, our finding of high levels of pparγ mrna well before confluence contradicts the cell culture studies reviewed in  <cit>  as the expression of c/ebpβ and c/ebpδ predate the expression of pparγ and c/ebpα  <cit> , which then activate adipocyte-specific genes during terminal differentiation. this illustrates the advantage of primary cell cultures, which offer possibilities to gain valuable insight into the early molecular events of adipogenic differentiation.

commitment of multipotent mscs to the adipogenic lineage involves simultaneous inhibition of other mesenchymal lineages. starting from day  <dig> we observed consistently decreased expression of myod, an early marker of the myogenic lineage. myod regulates the cell cycle in terminally differentiated myocytes by inducing cdk inhibitor p <dig>  which irreversibly arrests proliferation  <cit> . myod may play a similar role in mature adipocytes and in theory this could account for the increased expression at day  <dig>  activation of bmp <dig> from day  <dig> was an additional evidence for the inhibition of myogenesis. this growth factor equally promotes differentiation of the adipose, cartilage or bone lineages depending on the culture conditions  <cit> . therefore, activation of bmp <dig> is necessary but not sufficient for the commitment of preadipocytes. pparγ is a master adipogenic regulator, which simultaneously inhibits myogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis  <cit> . thus, high expression of pparγ observed long before confluence with the peak at day  <dig> probably posed a barrier to the induction of non-adipogenic mesenchymal cell lineages. non-adipogenic developmental pathways are expected to be strongly suppressed by the addition of hormones. yet, we did not find any noticeable changes in the markers of different cell types after day  <dig> and earliest increased level of the anti-osteogenic gas <dig> was observed at day  <dig> 

our pcna results suggested the highest proliferative activity during the first days of culture followed by a moderate reduction of mitotic activity at day  <dig> and much greater decrease by day  <dig>  overall, the expression patterns of genes involved in cell cycle were in concordance with these changes. highest levels of the key negative cell cycle regulators  were observed during days 15- <dig>  an additional evidence for the anti-proliferative status was the up-regulation of several pro-apoptotic genes, including retinoic acid-regulated apoptosis-related protein  <dig> . apr <dig> arrests cell cycle by suppressing the activity of cyclin d <dig>  <cit> , which was also induced at the latest stage. differentiation of adipocytes in mammals is associated with a reduction in proliferation at confluence followed by subsequent activation or clonal expansion and eventually with cell cycle arrest at terminal differentiation  <cit> . our results revealed the diversity of mechanisms potentially employed in the execution of the similar stage of events that occur during atlantic salmon adipogenesis. given that wat is a highly specialized organ that functions to regulate metabolic homeostasis and energy balance, nutrient sensing mechanisms could be opted for a role in the control of proliferation. growth cycle arrest of salmon adipocytes was in parallel with the up-regulation of the fatty acid binding protein  <dig>  that participates in the uptake, intracellular metabolism and transport of long chain fatty acids. fabp <dig> seems like a good candidate that could be involved in this type of regulation since its growth arrest activity was previously demonstrated in mammalian epithelial cells  <cit> . further, minimizing protein synthesis may also control proliferation as cell cycle arrest is a well established consequence of the general translational arrest, implied from day  <dig> onwards.

microarray analyses suggested changes in nutrient metabolism in the late phase of adipogenesis . as a consequence of the up-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase that inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase, the krebbs cycle most likely relied on the preferential use of acetyl-coa from fa oxidation rather than pyruvate to cover the cellular energy requirements. also, the expression of genes involved in fa β-oxidation, acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase and acyl-coenzyme a binding protein, steadily increased towards the end of adipogenesis. the up-regulation of g6pd and pgd pointed to the importance of the ppp, which generates nadph required for accumulation of lipids. the ppp can be seen as an alternative to glycolysis, because in addition to generating nadph and r5p, it can also provide cells with g3p, the phosphorylated glycerol backbone suitable for tag synthesis. induction of glycolytic pfk was also in line with the increased production of g3p and tag biosynthesis. biosynthesis of carbohydrates in carnivourous fish species could be important due to the very low carbohydrate dietary level in their natural diets  <cit> . indeed, we have seen regulations in all major glucose metabolic pathways in our model ; however, differentiation of adipocytes did not involve induction of hk, one of the key enzymes of glucose metabolism that only showed slight up-regulation at day  <dig>  this indirectly suggested that the transformation of gluconeogenic amino acids into glucose is important in adipocytes of atlantic salmon, at least in vitro. in addition, late activity of two key glyceroneogenic genes, mdhc and pepckc implied that glyceroneogenesis, which can be fed with mitochondrial intermediates derived from lactate and gluconeogenic amino acids, in addition to pyruvate, was active in developing fish adipocytes. to conclude, these findings illuminate potentially novel aspects of nutrient metabolism in adipocytes, which might take advantage of the coupling of glycolysis, the ppp and glyceroneogenesis, in order to fulfil shifting demands for the three major products of these pathways: g3p, r5p and nadph.

nadph produced by ppp is also crucially important for the cellular antioxidant defence since it is required for the regeneration of oxidized glutathione by glutathione reductase . up-regulation of gsr and a suite of genes involved in metabolism of glutathione, thioredoxin and iron was a prominent feature of late salmon adipocyte differentiation . indeed, a recently introduced concept  <cit>  clearly demonstrated ros as anti-adipogenic molecules that inhibit preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation. a reduced redox state in wat is now recognised as a distinct characteristic of visceral obesity in mammals, with overexpression of gpx peroxidases and high content of hydrophilic antioxidant gluthathione associated with pro-adipogenic processes. induction of the number of gpxs, known to be sensitive to lipid peroxidation, implied ros-provoked response in our culture and the need to maintain highly reduced state of the intracellular environment. however, contrary to what could be expected in situations of high ros production, neither gene expression nor activity of sod increased. in fact, the activity of this important ros scavenger progressively declined during adipocyte differentiation. thus, our data corroborated the indespensible role of glutathione-based antioxidant system in the maintenance of the reduced intracellular state in white adipocytes of fish.

accumulation of lipids in adipocytes coincided with the activation of genes coding for secreted proteins, such as adipokines adipsin and visfatin. together with the previous finding of leptin secretion by atlantic salmon adipocytes  <cit> , this supports the notion of wat as an active endocrine organ in fish. enhanced secretion may impose an additional load on the er actively engaged in lipid droplet synthesis  <cit> . the er compartment is suspected to exert a great deal of control over adipogenesis and association of obesity with er-stress is firmly established  <cit> . up-regulation of xbp <dig> and atf <dig> at day  <dig> in salmon adipocytes implied activation of upr in response to perturbations in the er homeostasis  <cit> . moreover, endoplasmic grp <dig>  which is located downstream from atf <dig> in the upr signalling cascade was down-regulated throughout the whole studied period but increased in expression at day  <dig>  a number of changes that are typical of upr  <cit>  was a hallmark of the latest stages of adipogenesis in our model. upr as a collection of pathways aimed at restoring er function may serve different adaptive roles and is observed both under pathological and normal physiological situations  <cit> ; for example, it is part of the developmental program in highly specialized secretory b and t cells  <cit>  and ß-pancreatic cells  <cit> . the revealed upr in developing fish adipocytes appears as a highly tailored homeostatic mechanism that is activated when increased number and size of lds meat the limited er capacity. although er is mainly considered to be a protein-folding factory, all proposed models of ld formation emphasize the engagement of the er compartment in the process  <cit> .

upr utilises two broad strategies to relieve stress in the er: increased clearance of misfolded proteins from the er and reduction of new protein influx into the er. we found ample evidence for the activation of the 26s proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal proteolytic pathways, which degrade misfolded proteins. components of the membrane protein complex, derlin  <dig> and p97-interacting cofactor p <dig>  which mediate transport from the er lumen into the cytosol were induced at day  <dig>  while other proteolytic pathways were up-regulated even earlier. upr-induced proteolysis may be employed to initiate the breakdown of superfluous proteins and organelles that must be replaced by more highly specialised cellular components during the adipocyte development. without a doubt, considerable remodelling of the cellular architecture occurs during terminal differentiation of atlantic salmon adipocytes.

upr also activates genes involved in protein folding. hsp40s and other j-domain-containing proteins act as co-chaperones for hsp70s helping to restore homeostasis in the er and in addition may have pro-degradation roles. down-regulation of translational machinery is commonly observed during upr  <cit> , and in our study, it involved a dramatic reduction in expression of ribosomal proteins.

alteration of the ribosomal composition is most certainly involved in the multiple regulation of the er-stress response. the curious up-regulation of the 40s subunit 18s rrna through most of the terminal differentiation against the majority of down-regulated ribosomal proteins is bound to have important consequences given the high level of 18s constitutive expression. this could signify a switch to a less efficient protein translation as increase in 18s negatively affects the ribosomal subunit ratio that favours protein production  <cit> . on the other side, reduced expression of 18s at the very end of differentiation could improve the effectiveness of protein synthesis in adipocytes that acquire secretory phenotype. in conclusion, fully matured adipocytes seem to reprogram the pattern of gene expression to sustain a certain level of protein production, congruent with the now recognised endocrine functions of wat.

secreted adipsin and visfatin have multiple immune functions as most other adipokines  <cit> . overall, expression changes of a large number of immune genes were characteristic of atlantic salmon asvf culture. dissimilar temporary profiles suggest different regulatory and physiological roles of these genes. additionaly, high initial levels and subsequent decrease of the chemokine receptors, tnfα and a panel of tnf-related genes could be explained by the changes in relative abundance of non-adipogenic cells that possess pronounced immune properties. in mammals, tnfα has high anti-adipogenic activity  <cit> , which was recently shown to be conserved in fish  <cit> . therefore, down-regulation of the tnf axis at days 7- <dig> was probably important for the onset of adipocyte differentiation. however, a number of immune genes showed either stable increase since day  <dig>  or biphasic regulation with the second activation after hormone induction . highest expression levels of many genes with diverse roles in different inflammatory pathways were observed during terminal adipocyte differentiation. numerous independent studies have provided evidence that a set of inflammatory and stress-response genes is activated in obesity in mammals . some of these genes likely have important roles in the coordination of homeostasis in wat, similar to the established roles of tnfα in modulating proliferative abilities in preadipocytes or metabolic activities in mature adipocytes.

an intriguing example is a group of virus responsive genes including tlr <dig>  a receptor of double stranded rna and a group of galectins, previously not reported to have roles in any aspect of adipocyte biology. the latter includes galectin  <dig>  which showed highly specific responses to viruses in previous studies from our group  <cit> . however, a large portion of immune genes, including complement component c <dig>  jak <dig>  the key actor of interferon signaling and flap, the regulator of eicosanoid metabolism, decreased expression by the time of ap <dig> establishment. finally, our results do not permit for major conclusions as to whether immune genes are important for adipogenesis or change expression as a consequence of differentiation and/or stress responses. however, it is clear that atlantic salmon wat possesses high potential for immune activity.

it is tempting to explain the activation of immune genes in differentiating adipocytes as a side effect of adaptation to the oxidative and er stress, since stress and immune responses share common regulatory pathways. ozcan et al.  <cit>  showed that er-stress-induced jnk-ap <dig> axis is the central link between tag overload in liver and diabetes. most interestingly, this is in agreement with our study, which shows that the same players are activated in fish adipocytes in response to increased lipid deposition. continuous administration of lipids led to the maximal observed tag loading at the end of the studied period, when the collective and highest expression of the ap <dig> complex components, including all c-jun and junb members was also observed. this additionally coincided with the induction of poh <dig>  a regulatory subunit of the 26s proteasome that has a specific de-ubiquitinase activity towards c-jun leading to its accumulation and subsequent increase in ap1-mediated gene expression  <cit> . a suite of highly expressed immune genes at this time supported an inflammatory type reaction in adipocytes. hence, an unrelieved er-stress could likely be the major cause of chronic inflammatory responses in lipid overloaded white adipocytes in fish.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed concordance between the gene expression profiles and the key events during adipogenic development of the primary culture of asvf cells, including fluctuations of proliferative activity, induction of adipogenic differentiation and suppression of other mesenchymal cell lineages and final tuning of metabolism towards production and accumulation of lipids. for the first time in a fish species we show that the establishment of mature adipocyte phenotype is associated with high activity of immune genes, activated upr and responses to oxidative stress. these changes are likely to be part of the normal adipocyte development but may be accentuated when cells are overloaded with lipids. high expression of pro-inflammatory mediators imply that excessive growth of wat in fish may cause disturbed endocrine function with possible negative effects on health, as seen in mammals.
