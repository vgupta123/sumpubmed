BACKGROUND
smoking is the largest preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the united states. it largely exerts these effects by increasing liability to complex disorders, such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , type  <dig> diabetes  and obesity  <cit> . smoking driven chronic diseases contribute to early death, disabilities, and strain the health care system  <cit> . therefore, understanding the mechanism through which smoking increases vulnerability to these disorders may establish new avenues for prevention or treatment of these complex disorders. although some of the details remain unclear, one of the key mechanisms through which smoking may increase liability to these complex disorders is inflammation.

although serological quantification of well characterized serum markers such as c-reactive protein  and interleukin  <dig> receptor  may provide a partial understanding of inflammatory changes with respect to smoking, this approach provides limited comprehension of molecular perturbation at a genome-wide scale.

a surge in recent publications has suggested that smoking associated changes in dna methylation may contribute to these perturbations. this surge began with sporadically published single gene studies that linked smoking to changes in maoa promoter methylation as well as to an increased risk for coronary heart disease mediated through methylation changes at f2rl <dig> <cit> . but in the past two years, these more limited examinations have been joined by several genome-wide investigations that have identified a growing number of loci whose methylation status is associated to smoking. the initial attempt at a more systematic approach was reported by breitling and colleagues who used the illumina humanmethylation 27k beadchip to probe dna from peripheral mononuclear cell pellets and identified several candidate loci including f2rl <dig> , gpr <dig>  and orai <dig>   <cit> . the first truly genome-wide results using the then newly introduced illumina humanmethylation 450k beadchip were first reported by monick and colleagues who studied methylation in lymphoblast and lung macrophage dna and found a large number of loci with particular emphasis on differential methylation at the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor   <cit> . six months later, using cord blood, joubert and colleagues confirmed and extended these findings at ahrr and further nominated gf <dig> and cy1a <dig> as genes affected by smoking status  <cit> . finally, in a study just published, zeilinger and colleagues identified a larger set of findings that confirmed the prior loci noted above and extended the gene list to include loci such as hivep <dig> , and cacna1d   <cit> .

these genome-wide finding present a potential portal for a better integrated understanding of pathways through which smoking potentially accelerates disease states. previous studies have established several smoking associated disease pathways. one such is the cyclooxygenase- <dig>  pathway where the expression of cox- <dig> induced by smoking leads to an increase in prostaglandin e <dig>  that mediates tumor progression and an increase in thromboxane a <dig> , contributing to tumor growth  <cit> . the cox- <dig> pathway that has been shown to be involved in numerous smoking related cancers is only one in many similar pathways that could conceivably hold the key to designing new therapeutic interventions and in some instances aid in improving current medical care.

a more recently developed method of identifying pathways perturbed by smoking is by coalescing information from network biology and epigenetics, specifically dna methylation. dna methylation is a critical mediator between the genome and the environment. although genome-wide dna methylation analyses allow the identification of differentially methylated cpg sites and genes, there is growing evidence that genes do not function independently, but rather in networks. hence, it is crucial to not only delineate individual loci affected by long-term smoking, but, in addition, use network theory to translate that single locus methylation information into a more holistic understanding of the effects of smoking on the function of the proteome and the cell in general.

this global understanding is necessary to help understand the reasons why some individuals are affected more severely than others. even though the rate of adults smoking is roughly equivalent in whites and african americans, african americans disproportionately experience smoking associated medical comorbidities  <cit> . the reason for this disparity is not known but both genetic and sociological factors have been postulated. epigenomic interrogation of this cohort would allow the disparity examination from a different perspective.

in prior studies, we have analyzed the relationship of smoking to peripheral mononuclear cell dna methylation in young adult african american smokers  <cit> . to determine whether smoking and peripheral mononuclear cells may have a role in the systemic inflammation in long-term smokers, we conducted a study to examine the relationship of smoking to genome-wide dna methylation in an independent and well characterized african american cohort who are older and have greater cumulative smoke exposure. in addition, we use a recently developed network based analysis technique to understand the effect of these smoking associated changes in dna methylation on protein interaction networks. our data suggest that regular chronic smoking is associated with highly significant differential methylation at a large number of loci including ahrr  and gpr <dig> . furthermore, the bioinformatic analyses demonstrate enrichment of loci involved in regulation of inflammation, immune function and coagulation.

RESULTS
clinical characteristics of the cohort
the clinical characteristics of the  <dig> african american females from the fachs project who participated in this study are given in table  <dig>  in brief, the subjects were middle-aged and tended to be severely obese. in this well characterized cohort, pack years was used as a quantitative measure of long-term cumulative smoking. consistent with the high rate of medical comorbidities noted in this population, the average serum crp levels  were  <dig>  in smokers  and  <dig>  in non-smokers . the average serum il6r levels  were  <dig> in smokers and  <dig> in non-smokers. the level of serum crp , but not the level of serum il6r, was significantly higher in smokers.

*total number of smoking individuals does not match the number of individuals accounted for under pack-years due to missing data points.

as a first step of our analyses, we analyzed the relationship of the two serum inflammatory markers featured in this study, crp and il6r, to each other and to pack years. figure  <dig> illustrates the results of those analyses. a positive correlation was present between crp and il6r. significant positive association was only observed between pack years and crp .

genome-wide dna methylation analyses
we analyzed the genome-wide methylation data of peripheral mononuclear cell dna using methlab with respect to smoking status, controlling for slide, plate and mixed cell population effects. this analysis was geared towards identifying differentially methylated cpg loci as a result of long-term smoking. since inflammation is closely related to smoking, we speculated that the methylation of genes involved in inflammation would be perturbed. from the analysis, after genome-wide benjamini-hochberg correction,  <dig> probes remained significantly associated at the  <dig>  level to smoking status. the  <dig> most significant cpg sites of this analysis are shown in table  <dig> and all significant cpg sites are shown in additional file  <dig>  as hypothesized, the most significant gene noted was gpr <dig>  which has been implicated in immune function as a gene that encodes for the g protein-coupled chemokine receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig> and  <dig> 

all average methylation values are non-log transformed beta-values. island status refers to the position of the probe relative to the island. classes include: 1) island, 2) n  shore, 3) s  shore, 4) n  shelf, 5) s  shelf and 6) blank denoting that the probe does not map to an island.

two other cpg probes, cg <dig> and cg <dig>  were situated in the body of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor  gene. the protein encoded by this gene provides feedback inhibition of ahr activation of the xenobiotic pathway by several different mechanisms  <cit> . our analyses indicate that on average, at these two loci, smokers tended to be hypomethylated. moreover, our analyses are consistent with prior results of young adult african american smokers. in young adult african americans, cg <dig> was also highly significantly affiliated to smoking and smokers tended to be hypomethylated. however, although hypomethylation was apparent at cg <dig> in both young and older smokers, this site was only significant with respect to long-term smoking and therefore could be a potential cumulative smoking biomarker.

validation of illumina array findings
validation of genome-wide dna methylation results is crucial, considering that the average beta values between smokers and non-smokers at numerous loci differed merely by about  <dig> . our previous study and this study indicate that cg <dig> as opposed to cg <dig> is not only sensitive to long-term smoking, but also to early smoking. therefore, cg <dig> being the more consistently sensitive smoking biomarker was independently validated using quantitative-pcr on a subset of  <dig> african american females. the characteristics and methylation levels from both methods for cg <dig> for the individuals in this subset is given in additional file  <dig>  a strong correlation of  <dig>   between these two methylation detection methods was observed ). furthermore, alongside the cg <dig> methylation level obtained via the illumina platform, this independent approach also identified cg <dig> as a biomarker for smoking  and  <dig>  respectively).

gominer analyses
we next analyzed the differential distribution of the methylation results using the traditional gominer algorithm which treats each probe as an independent assessment. these results are shown in table  <dig>  surprisingly, after fdr correction, only  <dig> of the top  <dig> pathways were significant at the  <dig>  level. both of these pathways were associated with phospholipid transport.

protein-protein interactions: network analyses using the mipalm algorithm
even though conventional genome-wide dna methylation analyses yielded consistent identification of differentially methylated cpg loci at the ahrr gene, this analysis did not capture the connectivity of co-regulated genes as a result of long-term smoking. hence, we employed an alternative approach for understanding the possible effects of smoking associated dna methylation changes on cellular function by reducing the dimensionality of data and taking advantage of our understanding of the protein interactome. we used the mipalm algorithm which employs a greedy search strategy on weighted networks to re-analyze the genome-wide methylation data utilizing only the subset of dna methylation data mapped to gene promoter regions.

using this approach, smoking associated dna methylation mapped to  <dig> significant protein sub-networks ranging from  <dig> ) to  <dig> ) proteins with mipalm p-values ranging from p <  <dig>  ) to p <  <dig>  ). figure  <dig> and tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> detail four sub-networks and the differential distribution of its constituent proteins with respect to gene ontology  pathways. the first sub-network consists of  <dig> proteins, second consists of  <dig> proteins, third consists of  <dig> proteins and the fourth consists of  <dig> proteins. consistent with our hypothesis, the bingo analysis demonstrated significant enrichment of proteins in the first and second sub-network to go pathways involved in immune function , the third sub-network for the jak-stat signaling cascade  and the fourth sub-network for coagulation . bingo analysis of the other  <dig> sub-networks resulted in pathways being enriched for molecular transport ), wounding  and ), cell signaling ), rna processing ), and central nervous system ). please see additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig> for complete details on these  <dig> sub-networks.

discussion
in summary, we confirm prior observations demonstrating that on average, the level of crp is higher in smokers than non-smokers, consistent with increased inflammation levels in smokers. we also extend findings by ourselves and others on the effect of smoking on peripheral mononuclear cell dna methylation to show that continued smoking is associated with altered methylation signatures at ahrr and in pathways associated with immune, coagulation and cns function.

the strength of the genome-wide findings with respect to the effects of smoking on dna methylation indicates a need for a better longitudinal understanding of the response of the genome to tobacco smoke. in two consecutive prior studies of younger african american smokers with considerably less total cumulative tobacco smoke exposure, we demonstrated that the principal changes of the dna methylation signature in response to smoking were in the xenobiotic response pathway regulated by the ahrr gene  <cit> . in contrast, in this group of african american female smokers, many of whom have been smoking for  <dig> or more years, the magnitude of the remodeling of the dna methylation signature is significantly greater and extends to a number of other genes and pathways including those relevant to inflammation, immune, coagulation and cns function. at the single gene level, the findings at gfi <dig> , f2rl <dig>  and gpr <dig>  serve to directly confirm prior findings by other investigators  <cit> . at a more integrated level, the implication of alterations of pathways involved in immune/inflammatory activities and coagulation  is consistent with the known effects of smoking on risk for inflammatory related diseases and stroke  <cit> .

since there is a strong association between cigarette smoking and innate immunity, we hypothesized that networks enriching for immune system/inflammation would be generated. two such networks are depicted in figures  <dig> and  that highlight the potential role of peripheral mononuclear cells in moderating vulnerability to some but not all complex illnesses with inflammatory components. the bingo analysis of network  <dig> indicated that the proteins are involved in the response to acute inflammation and complement activation. specifically, masp <dig> with a differential methylation adjusted p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> is known to be a protease that activates the complement cascade, enabling the clearing of pathogens. it has been shown that masp <dig> is also associated with the recurrence and survival rate of cancer   <cit> . therefore, studying the effects of smoking in a weighted network approach allows us to speculate that patients with colorectal cancer may increase their survival chances and prevent the recurrence of cancer by avoiding smoking. in clinical settings, knowing smoking history could assist physicians in making better judgments of the efficacy of treatments.

based on network  <dig>  it can also be seen that masp <dig> interacts strongly with masp <dig> and fcn <dig>  masp <dig> is known to support masp <dig> in the complement activation cascade  <cit>  and this network validates that a strong interaction is present between these two serine proteases. masp <dig>  masp <dig>  and fcn <dig> play key roles in innate immunity. aberrant methylation of these genes as a result of smoking could possibly impair an individual’s innate immunity, leading to the development, progression and recurrence of cancer. the network shown in figure  <dig> is enriched for chemotaxis. here, it can be noted that ccl <dig> with a differential methylation adjusted p-value of  <dig>  forms relatively strong interactions with mmp <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccbp <dig>  again, similar to network  <dig>  these interactions corroborate the role of smoking in the progression of inflammation.

our work also builds on the prior work by breitling and colleagues who showed the role of smoking associated differential methylation at coagulation factor ii  receptor like- <dig>  in moderating coronary artery disease, which also has a strong inflammatory component and whose presence is positively associated with crp  <cit> . furthermore, the network in figure  <dig> that enriches for coagulation showed f <dig> as the central protein, forming interactions with other proteins including f <dig> and crb <dig>  the mipalm analyses which generated pathways with important implications demonstrate that the pathways involving il6r and f2rl <dig> may not be the only important inflammatory genes/pathways operant in peripheral mononuclear cells and suggest the possibility that smoking associated dna methylation may act through a variety of mechanisms to increase systemic inflammation and vulnerability to some illnesses with an inflammatory component.

the time frame in which these cells begin to experience smoking associated inflammatory changes in dna methylation is not clear. in our prior examinations of young adult smokers, these changes were not evident on genome-wide basis. but these subjects were relatively young  at the time of ascertainment and the cumulative smoking exposure of even the heaviest of the smokers was not as extensive as that the lightest of the current smokers  <cit> . understanding when that shift to inflammatory processes occurs may be important to the allocation of smoking cessation resources. although it is well established that in general smoking cessation decreases risk for adverse outcomes such as myocardial infarctions and cancer, this may not be true for all patients who quit smoking. according to the “pulmonary overflow” hypothesis, many of the inflammatory changes associated with smoking are not due to the direct effects of smoke but are rather secondary to the “spillover” of inflammatory cytokines from activated macrophages in the lung parenchyma. because this inflammatory process tends to be self-perpetuating once it has been initiated, if “overflow” hypothesis is correct, stopping smoking in individuals with severe diseases may have little effect on subsequent inflammatory changes in the peripheral mononuclear cell compartment. if so, focusing smoking cessation resources on those smokers who do not have substantial diseases as evidenced by either peripheral or direct measures, may lead to more effective use of prevention dollars.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we reiterate that smoking contributes to inflammation which is consistent with increase in the average serum inflammatory protein, crp. we also demonstrate that methylation residues at the ahrr locus are sensitive to cumulative smoking and could be potential smoking biomarkers. however, the main finding in this well characterized cohort of long-term smokers is that differential methylation between smokers and non-smokers are key in delineating epigenetically contextual pathways and to identify highly connected networks that could be used for smoking related health diagnostics like cancer and coronary heart disease. we show the extensive effects of smoking on peripheral mononuclear cell dna methylation on pathways involved in coagulation, cns and immune function. understanding aberrant methylation caused by smoking in a network setting provides an integrated stage for understanding complex diseases like cancer while designing potential therapies. finally, smoking is an important confounder and should be included in future diagnostic models to accurately understand diseases.
