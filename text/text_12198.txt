BACKGROUND
gene expression is modulated through the alteration of chromatin states by epigenetic regulators. kr√ºppel-associated box zinc finger proteins , which together constitute the single largest group of transcriptional repressors encoded by the human genome, partake in this process  <cit> . the krab-zfp family is evolutionary recent and has expanded and diverged through multiple rounds of gene and segment duplications, to give rise to more than three hundred and fifty annotated members in humans  <cit> . despite their abundance, krab-zfps and their transcriptional targets remain largely uncharacterized except for a few  <cit> . krab-zfps carry a c-terminal array of two to forty c2h <dig> zinc finger motifs, each potentially capable of recognizing a triplet of nucleotides in a sequence-specific manner  <cit> , while their n-terminal krab domain recruits the kap <dig>  corepressor  <cit> . kap <dig>  binds krab and homotrimerizes through its n-terminal rbcc  domain, while its c-terminus acts as a scaffold for various heterochromatin-inducing factors, such as heterochromatin protein  <dig> , the histone methyltransferase eset , the nucleosome-remodeling and histone deacetylation  complex, the nuclear receptor corepressor complex  <dig>  and, at least during early embryonic development, de novo dna methyltransferases  <cit> . this results in local loss of histone acetylation, enrichment in histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation  and increased chromatin compaction  <cit> .

using chromatin immunoprecipitation  and a tiling array, kap <dig> has been documented to bind more than  <dig> sites in a human testicular embryonal carcinoma cell line  <cit> . a more recent publication additionally revealed that kap <dig> chromatin targeting falls into different categories, only a subset of which is dependent on its rbcc domain and consequently on its association with krab-zfps  <cit> . kap <dig> is dynamically associated with both heterochromatin and euchromatin. it is thought to organize constitutive heterochromatin and to stimulate its propagation, as evidenced by its co-localization with hp <dig> in pericentromeric heterochromatin domains  <cit> . using a combination of gene trapping and a drug-controllable krab-containing repressor, we recently demonstrated that krab/kap <dig> can induce long-range repression through hp1-dependent heterochromatin spreading  <cit> . however, while some promoters located tens of kilobases  from kap <dig> docking sites were silenced by this mechanism, others were resistant. here, we investigated the basis for this differential behavior by comparing the genomic context and the pre-existing levels of specific chromatin marks at repressed and non-repressed genes. this analysis revealed that genes most susceptible to krab/kap1-induced silencing were in genomic regions of high gene activity. more specifically, repression was most efficient at sites with increased levels of pre-existing repressive histone marks at promoters and gene bodies, embedded within gene-rich regions with high levels of transcription.

RESULTS
characterization of thousands of krab/kap1-targeted gene traps
to study the impact of specific genomic features on krab/kap1-induced silencing, we used the recently described trapping/silencing  system  <cit> . here, retrovirally-trapped cellular promoters are exposed to a drug-regulated krab-containing repressor. the ttrkrab protein contains the krab domain of the human kox <dig> zfp fused to the e. coli tetracycline repressor , and binds to tet operator sequences  in a doxycycline -controlled manner  <cit>  . we engineered retroviral-based gene trap vectors carrying tandem teto repeats and a promoterless gfp-puromycin resistance fusion reporter. this design predicts that i) reporter expression occurs from the promoters of active genes targeted by the integrants , and ii) dox withdrawal results in ttrkrab binding to the teto sites present in the provirus, thus exposing the trapped promoters to krab/kap1-mediated silencing  . using this experimental setup, we previously observed that while krab/kap <dig> can act over long distances it is generally more effective when bound  <dig> kb or less from a promoter  <cit> . to study which other parameters might affect krab/kap1-induced repression, we infected ttrkrab-expressing hela cells with low doses of retroviral-based trapsil vectors to ensure that only one integrant per cell was present. we made use of a combination of murine leukemia viral - and lentiviral - based trapsil vectors to obtain a greater diversity of targeted genes, since mlv tends to integrate close to active transcriptional start sites , while lv hits genes further downstream in their transcribed region  <cit> .

since we were interested in elucidating differences between krab/kap <dig> repressible and non-repressible promoters and genes, we reasoned that "all or none" phenotypes would facilitate subsequent analyses. therefore, we selected cells in which trapped promoters were highly active at baseline, and either strongly repressed  or almost completely resistant to this process  when the trans-repressor was allowed to bind its target . more specifically, we isolated trapped integrants from a population of cells by puromycin selection in the presence of dox, which impairs ttrkrab binding and silencing. then trapped integrants were subjected to subsequent rounds of cell sorting to isolate cells harboring gene traps with repressible promoters and reporter genes. these rounds first included the isolation of gfp negative cells when ttrkrab was allowed to bind , followed by the sorting out of gfp positive cells when its recruitment was inhibited  . isolation of non-repressible genes was achieved by a similar approach. however, trapped cell populations were cultured in the presence of ttrkrab binding  and gfp positive cells, which did not silence reporter expression, were directly isolated after trapsil vector infections .

after the isolation of cell populations with differential silencing phenotypes, we mapped proviral integration sites, in order to identify the trapped genes. for this, we combined linker-mediated pcr  of proviral-genomic junctions with massive parallel dna pyrosequencing  <cit> . the amplified sites were mapped to the human genome with the fetchgwi software  <cit> , and the ucsc known gene annotation was used to subsequently identify the trapped promoters . we previously described that about  <dig> in  <dig> promoters trapped by mlv-trapsil vectors were non-repressed by ttrkrab, compared with approximately  <dig> in  <dig> for those captured by lv-based vectors  <cit> . therefore, we isolated over  <dig> integration sites, with an intentional bias for non-repressed clones to obtain integrant numbers comparable to their repressible counterparts. 69% of the promoter-trapping lv integrants mapped within annotated genes, whereas only 54% of their mlv counterparts did . this observation is in agreement with previous data indicating that parental mlv as well as mlv-based gene traps integrate in promoter proximal regions, which are less well annotated than gene bodies, which in turn are the preferential integration sites of lv and lv-based traps  <cit> . consistently, we mapped  <dig> lv-trapsil integrants to the genome,  <dig> of which were located within genes. in contrast, we only found  <dig> intragenic mlv-trapsil integrants.

prior to further analysis, we validated our experimental approach by deriving clones from each population. all of the  <dig> clones analyzed exhibited the expected silencing profile in flow cytometry measurements. moreover, the clones comprised  <dig> non-repressed  and  <dig> repressed  lv-trapsil clones, in addition to  <dig> non-repressed  and  <dig> repressed  mlv-trapsil clones, . we also used chip analysis to verify that non-repressed genes properly recruited kap <dig> and downstream effectors to their ttrkrab docking site, in a doxycycline-dependent manner . after this validation, we continued with the characterization of the genomic context of our krab/kap <dig> repressible or non-repressible genes to find patterns correlating with silencing efficiency.

genomic environment of repressing and non-repressing gene trap integrants
we characterized the genomic environment of the integrants segregated according to their phenotype by using roc  curve analysis  <cit> . this type of analysis was previously used to identify the genomic features enriched around retroviral integration sites. this study confirmed that both mlv and lv preferentially integrate within transcriptionally active regions, and that this effect is augmented when integrants enabling reporter expression are selected  <cit> . in addition, this analysis also revealed that the effects of different genomic features on integration can change depending on the size of genomic segments in question  <cit> . therefore, we included genomic intervals ranging from  <dig>  kb to  <dig> mb in our analyses.

in order to characterize the genomic features surrounding the integrants in our different trapsil groups, we made use of the same approach. we first calculated the area under the roc curve, which is a common measure of a predictor variable's ability to discriminate between two classes of events. in our case we compared the average enrichment of a given feature at a set of genomic sites  relative to that of a set of random matched control sites. the read-out of this comparison is illustrated in color-coded heatmaps, where each rectangle represents the specific enrichment of a feature within the indicated intervals of distance. the relative enrichment between the integration and control site group is scored on a scale from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> is scored when a specific feature is enriched in the experimental integrants when compared to matched controls,  <dig> is scored when the opposite is true. a value of  <dig>  indicates no difference between the two groups. the patterns of the genomic features surrounding the trapsil integrant groups largely reflected the preferential genomic environment associated with either lv or mlv integrations . it included a preference for both retroviruses for active genes, in addition to their differential targeting to gene bodies and promoters, respectively. this is reflected by an increased enrichment of cpg islands and dnase i sites at short intervals around mlv integrants when compared to lv integrants. this difference is lost when larger intervals are included in the roc area calculation .

we then compared the roc values, which are proportional to the levels of genomic features at these sites, between trapsil groups harboring differential susceptibilities to krab/kap1-silencing. we did this by making relative comparisons between a chosen reference and other gene groups. the reference gene groups are indicated by the symbol "---" within the whole results section. using this approach we compared the levels of specific genomic features between the respective rep gene group and their corresponding nrep counterpart. when statistical differences were assessed, we found that lv-trapsil repressing integrants were located within gene-denser genomic regions than non-repressible integrants . furthermore, the environment of repressing lv integrants was enriched in cpg and dnase i sites, as well as in highly expressed genes , compared to that of non-repressing lv integrants. while all the described parameters were statistically significantly different between repressible and non-repressible lv traps, comparisons of their mlv-trapsil counterparts did not reach significant differences, although it showed similar trends . therefore, a positive correlation between gene activity in the environment of the targeted transcriptional unit and efficient krab/kap1-mediated silencing is established. the lack of significance between the mlv repressible and non-repressible trapsil groups could be due to smaller integrant numbers or could reflect the presence of other uncharacterized features affecting krab/kap <dig> recruitment, including the on average closer proximity of mlv integrants to promoters.

genomic features of matched repressed and non-repressed transcriptional units
repressing integrants were on average closer to the transcriptional start site of their targets, compared to non-repressible integrants . this finding is consistent with results from our previous analyses, which revealed that krab/kap1-induced repression was more likely if gene traps were located closer to trapped promoters  <cit> . therefore, the described integrant-centered analysis may suffer from potential biases linked to this spatial factor. we thus repeated our analyses focusing on genes that had a minimal size of  <dig> kb, a single known tss, and were frequently targeted by our trapping vectors, that is, hit at least three times in our series. we then classified these genes into three subgroups according to their susceptibility to krab/kap1-induced silencing expressed as a function of the distance between krab-docking integrant and trapped promoter. this led to the identification of  <dig> genes that supported long-range repression, that is, for which most integrants located within  <dig> kb of the tss were repressing ;  <dig> genes supporting limited range repression, with silencing occurring mainly when integrants were located  <dig> kb or less from the tss ; and  <dig> genes resistant to repression, where no significant silencing occurred irrespective of the distance between the tss and the krab/kap1-docking sites  . of note, there was no difference between the expression patterns of these genes in different tissues, indicating that these gene groups did not differ in being essential or not for cellular maintenance .

the genomic context of the three gene groups was reminiscent of observations made in the integrant-centered analysis , with genes from group  <dig> being in gene-richer and transcriptionally more active environments, and surrounded by a higher density of dnase i hypersensitivity sites . these associations, however, did not reach statistical significance. importantly, no difference in distance between repressor binding site and the trapped promoter was apparent when comparing the three groups, eliminating concerns about this potential bias for subsequent analyses of these genes . when we examined the expression levels of the different gene groups, we found that genes supporting long-range repression  were on average more highly expressed than genes that did not enable krab/kap1-mediated repression  . therefore, krab/kap1-mediated silencing seems to be more effective in regions of high gene activity. to further consolidate this result, we assessed the levels of different chromatin features, correlating with transcriptional activation or repression in our different gene groups.

chromatin features of matched repressed and non-repressed transcriptional units
we first assessed the levels of putative barrier elements such as ctcf, h <dig> /h2az or chromatin modifiers in the different groups  <cit> . this was achieved by utilizing published datasets, which were used to calculate the relative abundance of these features by roc curve analysis and by comparing these values between the groups. there was no differential association with either one of the three gene groups for the intervals tested .

we then assessed the abundance of a series of histone modifications present at an interval of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> kb or  <dig> mb around our promoters of interest. we first measured the levels of posttranslational histone modifications correlating with active gene expression, including histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> acetylation , h2bk <dig> monomethylation , h3k <dig> mono- and trimethylation , h3k36me <dig> and h4k20me <dig>  for this we generated genome-wide histone modification maps using a chip coupled to deep sequencing  approach in hela cells. then we used roc curve-based heatmaps to obtain relative enrichment values for the three groups. when the long-range repressing group  <dig> was compared to the non-repressing group  <dig> most of the active histone modifications were enriched in group  <dig> . this was the case for smaller  and larger intervals , consistent with the idea that krab/kap1-repressible genes reside in regions of very active chromatin both on a local and a more global scale .

we then measured the levels of histone modifications normally present at silent genes, such as h3k9me2/me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and h4k20me <dig>  for this we generated histone modification maps by chipseq in hela cells or relied on a published dataset for the distribution of h3k27me <dig> in this cell line  <cit> . furthermore, group  <dig> genes were comparatively less depleted in h3k9me <dig> at the tss and enriched in h4k20me <dig> at the promoter and within a  <dig> kb distance from the tss, compared with genes from groups  <dig> and  <dig> . therefore, promoters sensitive to krab/kap1-mediated repression harbor increased levels of some silent histone marks, which are embedded within a domain of very high gene activity.

discussion
previous analyses on the mechanisms of krab/kap1-mediated gene regulation have mostly examined the impact of this system on the expression of transfected promoter-reporter units. here, we investigated krab/kap1-induced changes within the context of endogenous genes. using a combination of promoter trapping and drug-controllable krab/kap <dig> recruitment, we previously observed that this complex, when docked to the bodies of transcriptionally active genes, could induce silencing over distances of several tens of kilobases  <cit> . however, we had also noted that repression was more efficient if the distance between the effector and the promoter was less than  <dig> kb. furthermore, a significant fraction of trapped promoters/krab docking loci escaped these rules, suggesting other counteracting influences. the present large-scale comparison of the genomic features of krab/kap1-responsive and krab/kap1-resistant transcriptional units identified by our gene trap system reveals a positive correlation between efficient krab/kap1-mediated repression of trapped promoters and i) a gene-richer and transcriptionally more active genomic context, ii) a more euchromatic environment, and iii) the pre-existence of some repressive marks at and around the promoter.

comparing krab/kap1-repressed and non-repressed genes gave no indication for a role of putative obstacles to the spread of heterochromatin, such as ctcf binding, accumulation of h <dig> /h2az or recruitment of hats . this is consistent with the observation that ctcf recruitment to the hs <dig> region of the chicken Œ≤-globin locus can be prevented without abrogating the barrier function of this dna sequence  <cit> . however, it is at odds with a recent study presenting ctcf as a marker of transition between euchromatic and heterochromatic regions  <cit> . a model reconciling these findings would be that ctcf acts as an h3k27me <dig> heterochromatin-specific barrier yet has no effect on h3k9me3-based heterochromatin propagation. however, it should be emphasized that our analysis was limited to the transcribed region of genes owing to our gene trap-based approach, precluding overly general conclusions on the possible role of barrier elements.

although both repressed and non-repressed genes were situated within euchromatic regions, as expected from the promoter-trapping approach used for their selection, we observed significant differences in both their local and broader chromatin environments. repressed genes were in regions containing generally higher levels of major euchromatin-associated marks and higher levels of transcription compared with non-repressed genes. therefore, there is a positive correlation between efficient krab/kap1-silencing and high gene activity. this is suggestive of a model whereby genes situated in more heterochromatic environments can only be highly expressed if endowed with an intrinsic ability to resist repressive influences, while genes located in more euchromatic environments do not need such protective mechanisms  <cit> . consistently, in our analysis krab/kap1-resistant units were on average closer to telomeres than their krab/kap1-susceptible counterparts, although this difference did not reach statistical significance .

genes repressed by the trapsil system also carried higher levels of the repressive marks h4k20me <dig> and h9k9me <dig> at baseline at and around their promoters, compared with their repression-resistant counterparts. noteworthy, these contrasting chromatin configurations were not only observed when comparing a selected set of multiply hit repressed and non-repressed genes , but were also present in the complete pools of repressing and non-repressing integrants . interestingly, a recent analysis of the chromatin structure of zinc finger genes found that high levels of both h3k36me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> co-localized at the 3' exons of these genes  <cit> . since krab-zfp genes, which belong to this gene family, are endogenous targets of krab/kap1-repression  <cit> , we performed the same analysis in our hela cell system and reproduced the same result . therefore, the high levels of both h3k9me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> at krab-zfp gene bodies may be necessary for efficient krab/kap1-induced heterochromatin spreading. the finding that the repressive h3k9me <dig> and the activating h3k36me <dig> marks are not co-regulated further supports this hypothesis  <cit> , since high levels of h3k36me <dig>  which positively correlate with active transcription, may independently enhance the spread of h3k9me <dig> at krab-zfp genes. this model is reminiscent of results obtained from the trapsil analysis, where high levels of both active and repressive histone marks can be seen in genes that accommodate krab/kap1-mediated heterochromatin spreading and silencing.

a difference between genes targeted by our trapsil system and endogenous krab-zfp genes lays in the finding that the latter do not seem susceptible to krab/kap1-mediated long-range repression  <cit> . this may be due to the use of our ectopic repressor system. alternatively, certain endogenous promoters may be resistant to krab/kap1-induced heterochromatin spreading. a possible factor in this process is the h3k9me1/ <dig> demethylase phf <dig>  <cit> . active h3k <dig> demethylation may prevent the heterochromatization of krab-zfp promoters and subsequent transcriptional silencing. this idea is consistent with recent phf <dig> genome-wide binding data that showed it locating to the promoter regions of zinc finger-encoding genes  <cit> .

other mechanisms potentially involved in conferring resistance to krab/kap1-mediated silencing are suggested by the analysis of genes that were hotspots of proviral trapsil targeting and carried both repressible and non-repressible integrants . in this subgroup, the repressible integrants generally clustered closer to the promoter than their non-repressible counterparts, consistent with the overall observation that silencing is most efficient when krab/kap <dig> is recruited in the proximity of the affected promoter. in some cases, however, the distributions of repressible and non-repressible integrants overlapped within the same gene. this could reflect the differential susceptibilities of the two alleles of a gene to krab/kap1-mediated repression, somewhat reminiscent of what is observed with imprinting, a process that involves a krab-zfp  <cit> . additionally, cells within a population may be heterogeneous for the chromatin status of specific loci, which in turn might impact on the consequences of krab/kap <dig> recruitment. such a phenomenon would be comparable to variegation, where particular genes are differentially expressed amongst cells of an otherwise apparently homogeneous population  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present work indicates that the impact of krab-mediated docking of kap <dig> on the expression of targeted genes is more variable than previously suspected. it further reveals reciprocal influences between the functional outcome of krab/kap <dig> recruitment to dna and the chromatin features of the involved loci. more broadly, the approach described in the present study, which combined an analysis of the functional consequences of exogenously introduced cis-acting krab/kap1-recruiting sequences with an examination of the transcriptional activity, genomic context and chromatin features of targeted loci, could be fruitfully applied to the study other epigenetic regulators.
