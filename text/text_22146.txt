BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of small non-coding rna, approximately  <dig> nucleotides in length, which regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and play a key role in development and specific biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis  <cit> . micrornas regulate their target genes through direct degradation of the messenger rna  and/or translational inhibition  <cit> . while subsets of mirnas are specifically expressed during early mammalian development  <cit> , others are essential for morphogenesis of particular organs, such as brain  <cit>  or heart  <cit> , or hematopoietic differentiation  <cit> . in specific mammalian cell types or organs single tissue-specific mirnas have been identified  <cit> . there is little information available regarding mirna expression in the mammary gland. in human breast tissue,  <dig> mirnas  were identified by microarray analysis  <cit>  and  <dig> mirnas  were detected in mouse mammary gland by northern blot  <cit> .

mammary gland development in both humans and mice is predominantly a post-natal process . at birth, rudimentary mammary ducts are present, derived from the ectodermal mammary placode. ovarian and pituitary hormones induce ductal outgrowth and branching during puberty, at about three to six weeks of age in mice, followed by alveolar differentiation during gestation and full functional differentiation upon parturition and lactation. after weaning, the entire alveolar compartment is remodelled to resemble a virgin-like state. each gestation initiates a new round of lobulo-alveolar differentiation  <cit> . these morphologic changes are illustrated in figure 1d. our aim was to study the pattern and temporal changes of mirna expression during mouse mammary gland development. in parallel, gene expression data were obtained to provide another view of the underlying biological processes at the mrna level.

altered mirna expression has been implicated in various human diseases including cancer  <cit> . in human breast cancer, complex de-regulated mirna expression patterns have been described  <cit> . the expression of  <dig> mirnas was significantly different between human normal breast tissue and breast cancer  <cit> , and a panel of  <dig> mirnas was found to be differentially expressed between molecular subtypes of breast cancer, namely luminal a, luminal b, her- <dig> positive, basal-like, and normal-like breast cancers  <cit> . this suggests that mirnas might play a role in regulating the homeostasis of the mammary epithelial hierarchy and their disruption could therefore contribute to tumourigenesis.

the mammary gland is unique in its capability to undergo cycles of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during adult life. more importantly, the mammary epithelium invades the stroma during mammary gland development in a process similar to that of cancer. therefore we investigated the mirna expression pattern during mammary gland development to provide the basis for comparisons with breast cancer profiles and for selection of representative mirna candidates for future functional characterization in breast development and breast cancer.

RESULTS
mrna expression during mammary gland development
our use of whole glands  for rna isolation could raise questions as to whether the expression changes reflect epithelial-driven biological processes. to gain an overview of changes in mrna expression between different developmental stages we assessed the activity of biological processes and pathways as determined by the mean relative expression of genes belonging to the same gene ontology term or kegg pathway . in accordance with previous reports, we found that most developmental stages were dominated by a few biological processes and pathways which are known to be involved in regulating mammary epithelial biology. for example during puberty and gestation, proliferation and associated processes of cell division and mitosis were highly represented, calcium/sodium ion transport, translation and intracellular protein transport were prominent during lactation, apoptosis dominated during early involution and inflammatory/immune response was dominant during late involution . we further assessed the proportion of luminal, basal, and stromal cells at eight developmental time points up to mid-gestation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting  of dissociated total mouse mammary glands. the proportion of stromal cells, which comprised up to 90% of the whole gland in juvenile stages, gradually declined until puberty, staying relatively constant thereafter comprising 65%-75% of the mammary gland. the proportion of luminal cells showed an increase before the onset of puberty with a peak at mid-puberty, followed by a slow decrease during gestation. basal cells showed a slow and steady increase after the onset of puberty . expression levels of luminal  and basal  cytokeratins reflected the changes in the epithelial compartment . although stromal cells contribute significant numbers of cells to the mammary gland, the mrna expression data show that the observed differential gene expression mostly reflected mammary epithelium-driven processes. this also suggests the observed mirna differential expression is mostly associated with mammary epithelium-driven events.

microrna expression profiles distinguish the stages of mammary gland development
out of  <dig> unique murine mirnas analysed,  <dig> mirnas were detected above background in one or more developmental time points. the majority of mirnas were expressed intermittently throughout development and were not present in one or more developmental stages. we first asked whether the global mirna expression profiles of time points would allow us to separate developmental stages. unsupervised hierarchical clustering of time points based on relative mirna expression resulted in a clear separation of developmental stages, with close clustering of time points with chronological or functional dependence . the early juvenile time points  clustered together, as did the consecutive stages puberty , mature virgin , and early gestation . lactation and the early stages of involution  clustered together and were clearly separated from the cluster of late involution stages, between  <dig> and  <dig> days after weaning. profiles based on the expression of  <dig> mirnas thus distinguished distinct stages of mammary gland development in a similar manner to mrna expression signatures .

global decrease in mirna and mrna expression during lactation and early involution
during lactation and the early stages of involution  we observed an approximately two-fold reduction in mean mirna expression . in contrast, overall mirna expression was increased approximately two-fold during the late stages of involution  as compared to earlier developmental time points . no obvious differences in global mirna expression were detected between the remaining time points, including juvenile, virgin, and gestation stages . a similar decrease was observed for the number of mirnas present at a given time point. during lactation and early involution, an average of  <dig> individual mirnas were detected at each time point , compared to an average of  <dig> mirnas present at other time points during development . changes in mirna expression during lactation and early involution were paralleled by a decrease in mean mrna expression as assessed by non-normalised microarray expression data . in contrast to the decrease in mirna and mrna expression during lactation and early involution, we observed a dramatic increase in the total rna content per mammary gland for these time points .

micrornas are expressed in seven distinct temporal clusters during development
we next aimed to identify groups of mirnas with similar relative expression patterns over the course of mammary gland development. model-based clustering  <cit>  identified seven clusters with distinct temporal expression profiles , and most individual mirna profiles were assigned to one of the seven clusters with high certainty .

the three largest clusters  showed a decrease in mirna expression during lactation and early involution, but differed in their typical expression at earlier time points. while many mirnas in cluster  <dig>  including six members of the let- <dig> family, showed high expression during puberty , maturity  and early gestation , members of cluster  <dig> frequently peaked in their expression before puberty  and during late gestation . cluster  <dig> mirnas generally showed a monotone increase in expression over time, reaching maximum expression in late gestation . in stark contrast to the typical pattern of reduced mirna expression during lactation and early involution, cluster  <dig> showed highest expression during these stages of development. this cluster included the seed-identical mirnas mir- <dig> and mir-200a, and mir- <dig>  which is situated in the same genomic cluster as mir-200a. it further included mir-146b, mir- <dig> and multiple members of the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> exhibited very distinct profiles, with the former being highly expressed exclusively in early development. cluster  <dig>  containing the mir-1/ <dig> and mir- <dig> family, showed a distinct peak of expression during late involution, between  <dig> and  <dig> days after weaning, as well as a second smaller peak during early development from  <dig> to  <dig> days of age. the five mirnas temporally co-expressed in this expression cluster are also clustered in the genome . the profile of cluster  <dig>  including mir-196a/b and mir- <dig>  showed an inverse pattern to cluster  <dig>  with high expression in early development and gestation followed by low expression in lactation and involution stages.

mirnas in the same cluster often shared identical seed sequences  and thus likely share common mrna targets. an analysis of biological processes and pathways enriched or depleted among predicted cluster targets is given in additional file  <dig>  we also observed genomic clustering of many co-expressed mirnas , suggesting polycistronic transcription.

breast cancer-associated mirnas during mammary gland development
we next assessed whether orthologs of the mirnas that had previously been associated with various clinicopathologic and molecular parameters of human breast cancer were represented within the seven temporal clusters of mirnas during mammary gland development. the selection of breast cancer-associated mirnas was based on data that we previously reported  <cit>  .

interestingly, mirnas with increased expression in luminal as compared to basal breast cancers  were often co-expressed during development, and strikingly enriched in cluster  <dig> , with  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas identified as highly expressed in luminal breast cancers representing more than 40% of cluster  <dig> mirnas. in contrast, mirnas overexpressed in the basal breast cancer subtype  were distributed equally among clusters  <dig> and  <dig> .

microrna expression in distinct cell types assessed by in-situ hybridisation
to further assess cellular origin of mirna expression, we analysed representative mirnas from three out of the seven clusters by in-situ hybridisation . there was generally much higher expression of all mirnas analysed in the epithelial cells compared to the stroma. the background signal from stromal tissue showed high variability between different probes, and a random pattern of staining. although this suggests non-specific binding in the stroma, weak mirna expression cannot be excluded. the strongest background staining of stromal tissue was found in the developmental stages of lactation and involution.

overall, there was good agreement between expression patterns found by in-situ hybridisation and by microarray. two mirnas, namely let-7b and mir- <dig>  showed specificity for the luminal and basal epithelial cell layers, respectively, during juvenile, puberty, and mature virgin stages. for let-7b , luminal expression was lost during pregnancy, lactation and early involution, and expression recurred in both luminal and basal epithelium in late involution. mir- <dig>  was strongly expressed in the basal epithelium until the mature virgin stage, showing increased expression in both luminal and basal epithelium during pregnancy and in late involution. mir- <dig>  showed increasing expression during late involution, in accordance with the microarray data. weak expression compared to background was present in juvenile and gestational time points, which was more pronounced in the microarray data. detailed in-situ images for all developmental stages are shown in figure  <dig> 

altered expression of mirna target genes during mammary gland development
to investigate systematic and specific changes in the expression of mirna targets, the  <dig> detected mirnas were grouped in families with unique seed sequence  and 3' utrs of genes with available expression data were scanned for seed matches to identify putative targets  <cit> . for each of these mirna families and each developmental time point, we tested whether the mean relative expression of putative targets was higher or lower than that of cohorts of control genes with similar 3' utr features . for most mirna families we did not detect any significant changes . figure  <dig> shows results for the mir- <dig> family, which showed greatest evidence for changes in the expression of predicted targets . low relative expression of mir- <dig> during early development and high expression during late involution were paralleled by increased and reduced relative expression of seed match-harbouring transcripts, respectively. among putative mir- <dig> targets genes related to focal adhesion were significantly overrepresented .

discussion
our data show that mirnas are highly co-regulated during mammary gland development. we found seven temporal clusters with complex expression patterns which did not coincide with single developmental stages. breast cancer-associated mirnas were found predominantly in two of these clusters.

micrornas previously identified to be highly expressed in the luminal as compared to the basal molecular subtype of breast cancer  <cit>  were enriched in cluster  <dig>  these mirnas showed high levels during puberty and gestation where proliferation and invasion are the predominating biological processes. we hypothesize that these luminal breast cancer mirnas may be involved in the control of proliferation and invasion during normal development and become deregulated in breast cancer. micrornas associated with the basal breast cancer subtype, including four members of the mir-17~ <dig> family, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  showed a distinctly different pattern, being equally distributed among clusters  <dig> and  <dig> 

of particular interest was cluster  <dig>  which in contrast to the global decrease in mirna expression during lactation and involution showed a specific increase in expression during these stages, paralleled by a decrease in the expression of predicted targets for one of the cluster members, mir- <dig> . the mirnas included in this cluster have previously been associated with various biological functions and pathways. the cluster includes mir- <dig> family members mir-200a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  there is increasing evidence that this mirna family plays a crucial role in the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition . all five members of the mir- <dig> family were markedly down-regulated in cells that had undergone emt in response to transforming growth factor -beta  <cit> . enforced expression of the mir- <dig> family was sufficient to prevent tgf-beta induced emt, while inhibition of the mir- <dig> family was sufficient to induce emt in cells  <cit> . during mammary gland development, a process similar to emt is known to occur between lactation and involution. the loss of inter-epithelial cell-cell-contacts, including loss of the cell-adhesion molecule e-cadherin, takes place during the early reversible phase of involution  <cit> . it is therefore tempting to speculate that the mir- <dig> family may act to prevent premature loss of e-cadherin and induction of emt during lactation.

another mirna highly expressed during lactation and early involution, mir-146b, has been associated with the regulation of innate immune response and inflammation. mir-146a expression has been reported to be substantially increased in murine t helper   <dig> cells compared to th <dig> cells and naïve t cells  <cit> . the th <dig> and th <dig> cytokine milieu has recently been implicated in mouse mammary gland development. mammary epithelial cells were demonstrated to undergo a switch from th <dig> to th <dig> cytokine production upon the induction of luminal differentiation  <cit> . it is an intriguing possibility that mir- <dig> might be involved in abrogating the th <dig> bias in cytokine expression that continues during gestation and lactation, to facilitate a switch back to a th <dig> environment upon involution.

of note, we did not detect obvious changes in the mirna expression pattern between the stages of lactation and early involution in our data, although there are known morphological and transcriptional changes  <cit> . this contrasts with what we observed at the level of mrna expression, where we could see clear differences between the two stages . subtle differences in mirna expression between lactation and early involution may have potentially been masked by the global decrease in mirna expression we observed during these stages.

we identified a significant global down-regulation of mirnas and mrnas during the stages of lactation and early involution. the total rna content per mammary gland was increased during these stages. since our analysis of mirna expression was performed in equal amounts of total rna, this finding suggests that mirnas and mrnas represented a smaller fraction of total rna during lactation and early involution. we hypothesize that the up-regulation of the transcriptional and translational machinery during milk production  may lead to a relative rather than absolute depletion of mirnas during these developmental stages.

during mouse mammary gland development we observed that many let- <dig> family members showed a peak in expression during puberty, the mature virgin stage, and early gestation, followed by a marked decrease and low levels during lactation and involution. this observation is consistent with recent reports that let- <dig> expression is depleted in mouse mammary epithelial progenitors  <cit>  and in breast tumour-initiating cells  <cit> , and that enforced let- <dig> expression could inhibit the self-renewal capacities of cells  <cit> . the developmental stages of the juvenile gland, puberty, and early gestation, where we detected increasing levels of let- <dig>  are characterised by a marked expansion of the luminal and alveolar cell compartment which presumably contains a high frequency of relatively differentiated cells. the subsequent decrease in let- <dig> expression during lactation may allow for a relative expansion of the progenitor compartment which is necessary for the reconstitution of the alveolar compartment during the next pregnancy cycle. on the other hand, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which were reported to be highly expressed in mammary progenitor cells  <cit> , seemed to be enriched during gestation and again during late involution. these data suggest that mirnas may contribute to the balance between progenitor cells and their differentiated progeny during mammary gland development.

when interpreting changes in mirna expression during mammary gland development, changes in the cellular composition of the mammary gland have to be taken into consideration. we observed that the proportion of stromal cells gradually declined until puberty. epithelial and in particular luminal cells showed a peak at puberty followed by a decrease, which was reflected in gene expression patterns, such as those of luminal and basal cytokeratins. nevertheless, the variety of biological processes and pathways and their observed temporal expression pattern  cannot be solely explained by changes in the cellular composition. although stromal cells contribute significant numbers of cells to the mammary gland, our mrna expression data show that the observed differential gene expression mostly reflected mammary epithelium-driven processes, and therefore we infer that changes in mirna expression are also predominantly epithelial-driven. we were not able to demonstrate by microarray analysis a clear correlation between the expression of a particular mirna and a predominating cell type. it is an inherent limitation of this study that the impact of cell type heterogeneity on relative expression patterns obtained from whole mammary glands cannot be conclusively assessed. future analysis of isolated cell populations may help to address this question, and newer technologies for mirna profiling which have become available in the meantime allow the analysis of smaller numbers of cells. nevertheless, our analysis of three candidate mirnas by in-situ hybridisation gives some indication of cell type specific expression in mammary epithelial cells. microrna expression was generally much higher in epithelial cells compared to the stroma, suggesting that the expression patterns found by microarray mostly reflect temporal changes in the epithelial cell compartment. within the epithelial compartment, cell type-specific expression was demonstrated for let- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which were predominantly expressed in luminal and basal cells, respectively, confirming previous reports of their expression in human luminal and basal breast epithelium  <cit> .

it was shown previously that mirnas and their targets often exhibit mutually exclusive expression both in the spatial and temporal domain  <cit> , and that conserved targets and mirnas are co-expressed but with reduced relative target expression in the presence of the mirna  <cit> . we failed to detect widespread systematic changes in the relative expression of putative targets during mammary gland development. however, we did observe trends for individual mirna families , most notably the mir- <dig> family, for which mirnas and targets showed anti-correlated expression . these observations are consistent with mirnas affecting mrna expression levels  <cit> . the down-regulation of mir- <dig> targets, enriched for focal adhesion genes, would fit with the extensive remodelling and changes during late involution. future analysis of isolated cell populations will further contribute to investigations of the relationship between mirnas and their targets.

CONCLUSIONS
we expect that this first comprehensive data set of mirna and mrna gene expression during mammary gland development will provide an important resource for the future functional characterisation of individual mirnas and their targets in mammary epithelial cells. indeed with our current understanding of mirna target recognition  combined data sets such as the one presented here represent important resources that will have increasing value as data integration methods improve. it is likely that with further functional experimentation new mirna target-recognition rules will be uncovered and these data will also be an important functional genomics resource for their biological validation.
