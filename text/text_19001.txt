BACKGROUND
the location and pattern of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease  are variable. whereas ulcerative colitis  is limited to the colon with a sharp delineation between the involved and non-involved mucosa, crohn's disease  can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and is associated with patchy distribution of mucosal lesions. ileal localization occurs in about 80% of cd patients, and about 30% of cd patients have isolated ileal disease. although it is generally accepted that ibd develops as a result of an altered immune response to luminal content in a genetically susceptible host, the mechanism by which the site of disease is selected remains unknown. important differences in function, architecture and bacterial distribution between the ileum and colon have been described. peyer's patches, which consist of aggregated lymphoid tissue and play a central role in the induction of mucosal immune responses, are a hallmark of the terminal ileum. increased numbers of mucosa-associated e. coli are observed in ibd, and adherent invasive e. coli  strains were highly associated with the ileal mucosa in cd patients. moreover, the reduced number of goblet cells in the ileum results in decreased mucus secretion and increased contact between the mucosa and luminal content  <cit> .

several subsets of t helper  cells contribute to defensive responses at inflammatory sites  <cit> . dendritic cell-derived cytokines skew the differentiation of naïve cd4+ t cells into th <dig>  th <dig>  th <dig> or regulatory t cell  subsets. for many years, cd was believed to be mediated by th <dig> cytokines, while uc was believed to be mediated by th <dig> cytokines; however, recent data have implicated th <dig> cells in the pathogenesis of ibd  <cit> . the invasion of extracellular bacteria into the intestinal mucosa triggers the expression of il-23a, driving th <dig> cells to release il-17a, il-17f, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  which in turn exert a number of proinflammatory effects on intestinal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, macrophages and fibroblasts  <cit> . in addition to their proinflammatory functions, il-17a, il-17f and il- <dig> have been reported to induce increased expression of epithelial barrier protective genes such as defensins, mucins, tight junction proteins and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins  <cit> .

the differentiation of th <dig> cells depends on the activation of janus kinase  <dig> , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  and the transcription factor rar-related organ receptor c <dig>  and is regulated by a combination of cytokines, including il- <dig>  il-1b , tgfb <dig> , il-23a, and the autocrine activity of il- <dig>  <cit> . chemokine  receptor  <dig>  which is expressed on the surface of th <dig> cells, contributes to their recruitment to chemokine  ligand  <dig>  produced at the inflamed mucosa  <cit> .

the important role of th <dig> cells in the pathogenesis of ibd is also supported by genome-wide association studies, which have demonstrated that ccr <dig>  stat <dig>  jak <dig>  il23r and il12b are cd susceptibility genes  <cit> . interestingly, single nucleotide polymorphisms  within il23r, il12b, stat <dig>  jak <dig>  the il22/il <dig> and the il2/il <dig> gene cluster have also been found to be associated with uc  <cit> .

although the expression of th17-related genes has been studied previously, most studies included only colonic samples and were focused on a limited number of genes. increased expression of il17a, il17f, il <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccr <dig> has been found in inflamed colonic tissues of ibd patients  <cit> . in only one study, il17a and il <dig> were mildly increased in active ileal cd samples  <cit> .

to examine the possible differences in the expression levels of genes involved in the th <dig> pathway, we assessed the mrna levels of the th <dig> effector cytokines and genes involved in the differentiation and recruitment of th <dig> cells in both colonic and ileal biopsies of healthy controls, uc patients and cd patients.

RESULTS
the mrna expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and th17-related genes in colonic and ileal samples of healthy controls
the expression level of the proinflammatory cytokine il <dig> was equal in colonic and ileal controls, while the expression level of tnf  was slightly higher in ileal control samples than in colonic control samples  .

the expression levels of the th <dig> effector cytokines il17a, il17f, il <dig>  il <dig> and il <dig> were comparable between colonic and ileal control samples ; however, the expression of these cytokines in each individual sample was not consistent. in one ileal sample and none of the colonic samples, all five cytokines were expressed. in one colonic sample and four ileal samples, three to four cytokines were expressed, while in eight colonic samples and seven ileal samples, one to two cytokines were expressed. in four colonic samples and three ileal samples, none of the five cytokines were detected.

we next examined the expression of genes involved in the differentiation of th <dig> cells. tgfβ  and stat <dig>  were expressed at higher levels in ileal control samples than in colonic control samples, while il <dig>  il1β and il23a expression levels were similar in colonic and ileal control samples .

expression of genes involved in the recruitment of th <dig> cells was also assessed. ccr <dig> expression was higher in ileal control samples than in colonic control samples , while ccl <dig> expression was similar between colonic and ileal controls .

the mrna expression levels of inflammatory mediators in inflamed colonic and ileal samples of ibd patients
although all samples were taken from endoscopically inflamed mucosa, we quantified inflammation by measuring the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines il <dig> and tnfα. the expression level of il <dig> has been shown to be associated with the grade of inflammation  <cit> . il <dig> was strongly induced in inflamed colonic samples from uc  and cd patients  and in inflamed ileal samples from cd patients  . the expression level of il <dig> was significantly higher in uc samples than in colonic cd samples . expression of tnfα was only significantly increased in uc samples ; however, a tendency for increase was observed in ileal cd samples  . expression levels of tnfα were significantly higher in uc samples than in colonic cd samples .

the mrna expression levels of th <dig> effector cytokines in inflamed colonic and ileal samples of ibd patients
in uc samples, il17a , il <dig> , il <dig>  and il <dig>  were strongly induced, and il17f  was weakly induced, while in colonic cd samples, il17a  and il <dig>  were strongly induced, and il <dig> , il <dig>  and il17f  were weakly induced . in ileal cd samples, il <dig>  was strongly induced, while il17a , il <dig>  and il17f  were weakly induced, and expression levels of il <dig> were similar to those in ileal controls. furthermore, in the colon, expression levels of il17a  and il <dig>  were significantly higher in uc samples than in cd samples. in cd samples, expression of il <dig>  was significantly higher in the colon than in the ileum.

the mrna expression levels of genes involved in the differentiation of th <dig> cells in inflamed colonic and ileal samples of ibd patients
il1β , il <dig> , tgfβ  and il23a  were strongly induced in both uc and colonic cd . stat <dig> was only slightly induced in colonic cd  and uc . although a strong induction of the th <dig> differentiation factor il1β  and a weak induction of il <dig>  were observed in ileal samples, tgfβ, il23a and stat <dig> were not induced. in the colon, il23a was expressed at higher levels in uc samples than in cd samples . in cd samples, tgfβ  and il23a  were expressed at higher levels in the colon than in the ileum.

the mrna expression levels of genes involved in the recruitment of th <dig> cells in inflamed colonic and ileal samples of ibd patients
expression levels of both ccr <dig>  and ccl <dig>  were significantly increased in colonic cd and uc samples but not in ileal cd samples .

the mrna expression levels of the master transcription factor rorc in inflamed colonic and ileal samples of ibd patients
two sets of primers for rorc were developed. the rorc primers detect both the full-length transcript and the shorter t cell-specific isoform, while the rorc <dig> primers detect only the full-length transcript. a strong correlation was found between rorc <dig> and rorc expression levels . when comparing the rorc <dig> and rorc levels between healthy controls and uc and cd patients, higher significance levels were achieved using the primer detecting both transcripts. this suggests a stronger role for the t cell-specific rorc <dig> isoform.

in colonic samples from cd and uc patients, rorc mrna expression levels were comparable to those in healthy controls, while in ileal cd samples, expression levels of rorc were lower than those in control samples  .

discussion
a growing body of human studies and studies in mouse models has shown that th <dig> effector cytokines promote chronic intestinal inflammation through the induction of multiple proinflammatory mediators. the role of th <dig> cells has predominantly been studied in cd; these cells have rarely been studied in uc and have never been studied in healthy controls. although it is generally accepted that ibd develops as a result of an altered immune response to luminal content in a genetically susceptible host, the factors influencing the selection of the disease site remain unknown. at present, even the mechanisms controlling development of ileitis and/or colitis in transgenic or gene-targeted mouse models are unclear.

in the present screening study the mrna expression signatures of th <dig> pathway-associated genes were evaluated in colonic and ileal samples of healthy controls, uc and cd patients. we first compared the expression levels in healthy colons to those in healthy ilea. evaluation of the th <dig> effector cytokines revealed no significant differences in expression levels between the colon and the ileum. notably, these cytokines were not detectable in the majority of control samples, although expression was more frequently observed in ileal samples than in colonic samples. in addition, the expression of one th <dig> effector cytokine was not necessarily linked to the expression of the other effector cytokines in a single mucosal specimen. the relative stasis of luminal content in the terminal ileum supports our observation that th <dig> effector cytokines were more often present in the ileum than in the colon because il-17a, il-17f and il- <dig> enhance the production of antimicrobial peptides, which protect the intestinal mucosa against bacterial invasion  <cit> . the diversity of bacteria present among individuals might explain why not all individuals express th <dig> effector cytokines.

recently, a subset of cd4+ t cells that provide help to b cells for antibody production in germinal centers , termed follicular helper t cells , were identified  <cit> . tfh cells produce il- <dig>  which is necessary for gc formation. the increased number of ileal controls expressing il <dig> could reflect the presence of peyer's patches in the terminal ileum, where b lymphocytes predominate in the gc. the associated increased ileal expression of the downstream signaling molecule stat <dig> supports this assumption.

ccr <dig>  which is present not only on th <dig> cells but also on treg cells, b cells, neutrophils and immature dendritic cells, plays a critical role in the migration of these cells to its ligand ccl <dig>  which is produced at inflammatory sites  <cit> . ccr6-positive cells have been detected in lymphoid organs like peyer's patches and isolated lymphoid follicles and seem to be more common in the ileum than in the colon. tgfβ was shown to be the main factor for induction of ccr <dig> mrna expression in th <dig> cells and dendritic cells  <cit> . in our study, the increased expression of ccr <dig> in ileal controls was correlated with increased ileal tgfβ .

the increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine il <dig> in the inflamed colonic and ileal ibd samples confirmed the endoscopic inflammatory state of our samples. the relationship between the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the grade of inflammation or disease activity index has been described before and is supported by our observation that il <dig> expression levels in samples from patients in remission are similar to those of healthy controls   <cit> . tnfα is less useful as parameter of inflammation because reports about its expression and secretion in inflamed samples are contradictory  <cit> . in support of this view, expression of tnfα was increased in uc patients and not increased in cd patients.

except for ileal il <dig>  significant induction of all th <dig> effector cytokines was observed in inflamed colonic and ileal ibd samples. moreover, induction of il17a and il <dig> was significantly more pronounced in uc than in colonic cd, and this induction was associated with more intense inflammation as defined by increased induction of il <dig>  in contrast, this association was not found in ileal cd where only marginal induction of th <dig> cytokines was detected in ileal cd samples with il <dig> expression levels similar to those observed in uc samples. marked induction of il1β, il <dig>  tgfβ and il23a, genes involved in the differentiation of th <dig> cells, was observed in colonic inflammation. the downstream signaling molecule stat <dig> was only moderately increased in colonic samples. in ileal cd samples, except for a strong induction of il1β, only a weak induction of il <dig> and no increase in tgfβ, il23a and stat <dig> was detected. in parallel, significant increases in ccr <dig> and ccl <dig>  genes involved in the recruitment of th <dig> cells, were only observed in colonic samples, supporting a less pronounced infiltration of th <dig> cells in ileal inflammation.

the observed increase in expression levels of il17a, il17f, il <dig> and il <dig> and the downstream proinflammatory cytokines il <dig> and il1β in the inflamed ileum could originate from cells other than th <dig> cells. lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells, which are important in the development of lymphoid organs, are an innate source of il-17a and il- <dig>  <cit> . paneth cells, which are common in the ileum, also express il-17a  <cit> . natural killer cells, natural killer t cells and a newly identified t helper cell, th <dig> cells, which are involved in inflammatory skin disorders, are sources of il- <dig>  <cit> . importantly, il-17a, il-17f and il- <dig> mediate protective effects through the induction of defensins  <cit> .

although mrna expression levels are not the optimal way to study the activity of transcription factors, the significantly reduced expression of ileal rorc support a defect in the th <dig> pathway in ileal disease.

we should consider the fact that gene expression could be affected by the use of anti-inflammatory drugs. although 42% of the included patients were on medication, statistical analysis did not show an effect.

given that snps within ccr <dig>  stat <dig>  jak <dig>  il23r, il12b, the il22/il <dig> and the il2/il <dig> gene cluster have been found to be associated with cd and or uc, we should take in mind the influence of these snps on th <dig> cytokine profiles. recently, response to anti-tnf therapy was demonstrated to be modulated by il23r variants, linking th <dig> function to biologicals  <cit> . twenty-two percent of the samples in this study were included in the gwas of barrett and thus genotyped for ccr <dig>  stat <dig>  jak <dig>  il23r and il12b  <cit> . unfortunately, due to a low frequency of patients heterozygous or homozygous for the different risk alleles, such comparisons were not conclusive  <cit> .

a lot of factors inherent to the heterogeneous nature of biopsies may influence rna levels. although we have to be cautious with the extrapolation of mrna expression data to functional immunological conclusions, biological replicates and the previously demonstrated association between rna and protein levels of most genes included in this study contribute to reliable conclusions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study demonstrated important differences in the expression of th17-associated genes in colonic and ileal disease. inflammation of the colon of both cd and uc patients is clearly associated with increased expression levels of th <dig> effector cytokines and genes involved in the differentiation, amplification and recruitment of th <dig> cells, whereas in the inflamed ileum, essential factors for differentiation and recruitment of th <dig> cells are missing. the differential expression of th17-related genes between the colon and ileum could reflect different immune regulation in the colon and ileum, suggesting different therapeutic approaches for cd patients with colonic versus ileal disease. future clinical trials of agents blocking th17-related genes should take into account the disease location in cd patients. in addition, the difference in expression profiles between the colon and ileum also provide the potential of identifying diagnostic biomarkers.
