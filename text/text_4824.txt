BACKGROUND
canine oral fibrosarcoma  is one of the three most common oral neoplasms in dogs  <cit> . compared to other anatomic locations, cof exhibits a biologically aggressive behavior with recurrence rates following resection of 24–59 %, metastasis in up to 30 % of cases, and reported median survival times of 7– <dig> months . the most recent of these studies included  <dig> dogs and found significant predictors of median survival time to include tumor location , size , type of surgery , histologic margin status, and grade . this study included  <dig> dogs that received adjuvant systemic therapy  but because of this low sample size and the fact that therapy was often initiated after relapse of disease, no conclusions could be drawn regarding the potential efficacy of this treatment strategy  <cit> . currently, the prognosis for this disease remains guarded due to a lack of effective systemic therapeutic options to address potential metastasis as well as local recurrence .

the use of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors  for targeted therapy in veterinary oncology is increasing as indicated by the growing number of clinical reports . although some reports describe use of tkis alone, others have reported on observed clinical efficacy when combined with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and/or piroxicam  <cit> . proposed mechanisms behind combination therapy include chemosensitization as well as immunomodulatory effects such as suppression of regulatory t cells and restoration of t cell-mediated immune responses  <cit> . masitinib is conditionally approved by the united states food and drug administration and the european medicines agency for use against canine mast cell tumors. masitinib targets pdgfr-α and -β, kit, lyn, and to a lesser degree, the fgfr <dig> and fak pathways  <cit> . masitinib may also affect vegfr- <dig> levels  <cit> . imatinib is another tki that targets some of the same kinases as masitinib, including pdgfr-α, pdgfr-β, and kit  <cit> . although not approved by the united states food and drug administration for use in veterinary patients, off-label veterinary use of imatinib has been reported with favorable results in canine and feline cancer patients .

to our knowledge, there are no reports that have profiled expression of tyrosine kinases in cof, nor the potential for targeting by masitinib or imatinib. the purpose of this study was to  evaluate the expression of pdgfr-α, pdgfr-β, kit, and vegfr- <dig> in archived cof biopsies and immortalized cell lines and  assess the effects on cell viability of two tkis , either alone or in combination with doxorubicin, against the cell lines in vitro. the results presented herein begin to shed light on this strategy as a potential future therapy for cof.

RESULTS
archived canine oral fibrosarcoma tumors express pdgfr-α and –β protein
immunohistochemistry  for pdgfr-α, pdgfr-β, kit, and vegfr- <dig> demonstrated differential expression of each protein amongst the six archived tumor specimens with good agreement between subjective observer-derived assessments and semi-quantitative software-derived results . representative photomicrographs for each of the proteins evaluated are shown in fig.  <dig>  a representative software threshold-processed image of tumor cell immunoreactivity for pdgfr-β is shown in fig.  <dig>  higher percentages represent more immunoreactivity . mitotic counts in five of six sarcomas were low, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> in ten 400x high power fields. case  <dig> had a much higher mitotic count . this tumor also had the largest nuclei, poorest overall organization, and most intense ihc staining for both pdgfrs.table  <dig> immunohistochemistry reactivity scores

staining for pdgfr-α was detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei of 75–100 % of neoplastic cells in five of the six tumor samples, with a relatively uniform staining intensity among samples. in all sections, pdgfr-α staining was also present in the cytoplasm and nuclei of endothelial cells including neoplastic endothelial cells of a canine metastatic hemangiosarcoma control sample. similarly, pdgfr-β was detected in the cytoplasm of 60–100 % of neoplastic cells in all six tumor samples. there was relatively uniform intensity and subcellular location of immunostaining of neoplastic cells in five of the biopsy samples with a similar distribution but weaker staining intensity in the remaining sample. two samples also showed cell membrane associated pdgfr-β staining. pdgfr-β stained the cytoplasm of endothelial cells in all sections including neoplastic endothelial cells in the hemangiosarcoma control sample. vegfr- <dig> and kit staining were uniformly negative in neoplastic cells of all six cof tumor samples. endothelial cells around but not within the tumors had cytoplasmic staining for vegfr- <dig>  whereas neoplastic cells of a metastatic hemangiosarcoma did not stain. most sections had interstitial mast cells that displayed a largely membrane-associated staining pattern for kit. in the mast cell tumor control sample, most neoplastic cells had cytoplasmic, perinuclear, punctate staining for kit ; less than 5 % showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining   <cit> .

canine oral fibrosarcoma cell lines express pdgfr-α and –β at both mrna and protein levels
pdgfra and pdgfrb mrna was reverse transcribed and amplified from exponentially growing mbsa <dig> and cofsa cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . amplicons were of the predicted size and sequencing reaction results matching the published sequence with 100 % homology. transcripts for kit and kdr were not detected  despite using two different canine-specific primer sets.fig.  <dig> receptor tyrosine kinase expression in cell lines. a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for kdr, kit, pdgfra, and pdgfrb in cofsa and mbsa <dig> cell lines demonstrates presence of transcript for both pdgfra and pdgfrb at the expected amplicon size with no evidence of kdr or kit transcript. the molecular weight ladder is shown on the left side of the image with the base pairs  listed. b western blot of pdgfr-α and pdgfr-β demonstrating protein presence in both cofsa and mbsa <dig> cell lines at the expected molecular weight of 123 kda. a lysate from 293 t cells was used as a positive control 



western blots showed strong expression of both pdgfr-α and –β in cell lysates from cofsa, with weaker expression in mbsa <dig> . these data coincide with the apparent mrna signals shown in these two cell lines .

masitinib or imatinib alone, or in combination with doxorubicin, inhibit canine oral fibrosarcoma cell viability
masitinib treated cells displayed decreased viability relative to the vehicle-treated control at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>  and 100 μm for both mbsa <dig> and cofsa cell lines . the calculated ic <dig> of masitinib for mbsa <dig> and cofsa is  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively. imatinib treated cells displayed decreased viability relative to the vehicle-treated control at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm for mbsa <dig>  and at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μm for cofsa . the calculated ic <dig> of imatinib for mbsa <dig> and cofsa is  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively.fig.  <dig> cell viability after treatment with masitinib or imatinib. graphical plot of the effects of a masitinib and b imatinib on viability of mbsa <dig> and cofsa cells. cell viability was assessed using a mts assay of mbsa <dig> and cofsa treated with escalating concentrations of masitinib or imatinib after 72 h of incubation. masitinib treated cells displayed decreased viability relative to the vehicle-treated control at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μm for both mbsa <dig> and cofsa . imatinib treated cells displayed decreased viability relative to the vehicle-treated control at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm for mbsa <dig>  and at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μm for cofsa . plotted values are mean ± standard error of the mean. the calculated ic <dig> of masitinib for mbsa <dig> and cofsa is  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively. the calculated ic <dig> of imatinib for mbsa <dig> and cofsa is  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively



the combination of either  <dig>  μm masitinib or imatinib with doxorubicin yielded synergistic reductions in cell viability for both cell lines . combination treatment demonstrated synergism in mbsa <dig> cells at all doxorubicin concentrations for masitinib and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm doxorubicin concentrations for imatinib . due to the greater reduction in cell viability seen with  <dig>  μm of either tki alone in cofsa cells, synergism was shown only at the highest doxorubicin concentrations tested:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm for masitinib and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm for imatinib .fig.  <dig> cell viability following doxorubicin treatment alone or combined with  <dig>  μm of either masitinib or imatinib. graphical plot of the effects of treatment with escalating concentrations of doxorubicin alone or combined with  <dig>  μm of either masitinib or imatinib on viability of  mbsa <dig> and  cofsa cells. cell viability was assessed using a mts assay following treatment with the above drug concentrations after 72 h of incubation. masitinib showed a synergistic interaction with doxorubicin at all concentrations for mbsa <dig> and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm for cofsa. imatinib showed a synergistic interaction with doxorubicin at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm for mbsa <dig> and at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm for cofsa. plotted values are mean ± standard error of the mean. synergism was defined as being present when the surviving fraction of cells exposed to the combination of doxorubicin and either tyrosine kinase inhibitor was lower than the product of the surviving fraction of cells exposed to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone multiplied by the surviving fraction of cells exposed to doxorubicin alone. see materials and methods section for detailed synergism calculation methods



pdgfrb sirna knocks down pdgfr-β protein expression and reduces oral fibrosarcoma cell line viability
western blot analysis demonstrated that pdgfr-β is expressed in both mbsa <dig> and cofsa cell lines, with a marked reduction in pdgfr-β expression evident in both cell lines after pdgfrb sirna transfection . densitometry measurements of actin-normalized pdgfr-β band intensity  revealed a reduction of pdgfr-β protein in mbsa <dig> and cofsa cells of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively.fig.  <dig> pdgfr-β reduction following pdgfrb sirna transfection. effect of pdgfrb sirna transfection on pdgfr-β expression in cofsa and mbsa <dig> cells assessed via western blot. reduced pdgfr-β levels are represented as decreased band intensity in the pdgfrb sirna treated lanes for both cell lines. cells were incubated with sirna for 48 h, as described in methods. scrambled sirna sequence used to account for nonspecific, off-target effects. to account for differences in protein loading between lanes, final pdgfr-β knockdown was reported as percentage of actin-normalized pdgfr-β band intensity in the sirna treated lane relative to actin-normalized pdgfr-β band intensity in the control  lane using computer image analysis software with a gel analysis package 



cell viability after pdgfrb sirna transfection was significantly reduced in both mbsa <dig>  and cofsa  cell lines compared to vehicle-treated control cells . visual comparison of sirna-transfected cells to control cells revealed a greater negative effect on cell viability than was reflected by the mts assay results .fig.  <dig> cell viability following pdgfrb sirna transfection. effect of pdgfrb sirna transfection on  cofsa and  mbsa <dig> cell viability assessed via an mts assay after 72 h of incubation, with representative photomicrographs of cells under each condition  vehicle alone, d scrambled sirna sequence, and e

discussion
this study begins to explore the potential rationale for using two commonly prescribed tkis  as adjunctive treatment in cof. the stimulus for this investigation is based on the premise that targeted small molecule therapy may provide an adjuvant therapeutic strategy for control of cof following surgery, given the challenge of obtaining complete surgical tumor excision and the reluctance of many pet owners to pursue adjuvant radiotherapy. we began by testing for the presence of targets of these two tkis, including pdgfr-α, pdgfr-β, vegfr- <dig>  and kit, in six archived cof tumors and two immortalized cof cell lines. our results demonstrate a similar expression profile between the immortalized cell lines and the archived tumor samples, leading into the second aim of the study: assessing the effects of the two tkis on cell viability, either alone or in combination with doxorubicin. our data show both cell lines were relatively resistant to single-agent tki treatment, with substantial reductions in cell viability and an increase in apoptotic activity being seen only at relatively high concentrations in most experiments. both tkis met the criteria for synergistic in vitro cytotoxicity when combined with doxorubicin, although the magnitude of this effect was relatively small. cumulatively, the present study provides insight into the potential validity of future in vivo investigations exploring the use of tkis, possibly in combination with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, as adjuvant treatment options in cof.

of the four potential tki targets evaluated via ihc, pdgfr-β was the most consistently expressed  and showed the strongest immunoreactivity across tumor samples. furthermore, pdgfr-β was detected within both cell lines at the mrna and protein levels. pdgfr-α was also frequently detected with 5/ <dig> archived tumor samples showing immunoreactivity, but with lower subjective staining intensity and scoring lower on our semi-quantitative immunoreactivity measurements. both cell lines also expressed pdgfr-α at both mrna and protein levels. the cof tumor sample with the highest mitotic count and least degree of differentiation was among the tumors with the most intense ihc staining for pdgfr-β and pdgfr- α, consistent with the positive effect of pdgf on cell proliferation. neither kit nor vegfr- <dig> were detected at the protein level within tumor samples or at mrna levels within the cell lines. these data indicate that at least two targets of the tkis used in this study are present within cof tumors and provided a rationale for proceeding with the evaluation of cell viability following tki treatment.

the in vitro effect of the tested tkis on cofsa and mbsa <dig> cell viability was observed to be relatively similar between the two drugs. these observations are consistent with the shared targets between the two tkis  <cit> . mbsa <dig> cells were consistently resistant to either tki, with significant cytotoxic effects seen only at high concentrations and no significant changes in apoptosis elicited by any drug concentration tested. by comparison, cofsa cells were similarly resistant to masitinib but slightly more sensitive to imatinib, with a modest but statistically significant reduction in cell viability at ≥ 1 μm concentrations. cofsa cells also demonstrated significant increases in apoptosis at select drug concentrations, consistent with their increased sensitivity to the treatments evaluated in this study. cofsa cells also showed a significant decrease in relative caspase activity at 30 μm masitinib, which may reflect a paucity of cells with caspase activity due to the extremely low cell viability at this tki concentration, as supported by our mts assay results. these relatively minor differences in tki sensitivity between cell lines may reflect a combination of differences in drug targets between the two tkis tested along with differences in the cell lines used  <cit> . to the authors’ knowledge, no studies have characterized specific receptor tyrosine kinase pathway dependence in either mbsa <dig> or cofsa cell lines. several other in vitro veterinary studies have reported similarly high masitinib or imatinib ic <dig> concentrations in canine hemangiosarcoma and feline injection site sarcoma cell lines  <cit> . in contrast, the cell-based ic50s for masitinib against pdgfr-α, pdgfr-β, and kit have been reported as  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μm, respectively, in an il3-dependent hematopoietic cell line  <cit> . these values are markedly lower than the ic <dig> values seen in the present and prior in vitro veterinary studies, raising the possibility that the observed reductions in cell viability may be due to off-target effects. this is also compatible with the calculated ic <dig> values from another veterinary study evaluating in vitro masitinib effects on a variety of immortalized canine cancer cell lines  <cit> . the reason for this relative resistance to single-agent tki treatment in the cell lines in the present report, as well as in the those cell lines used in the referenced studies, is not fully understood but likely reflects the cell lines’ lack of dependence on the targeted pathways for survival  <cit> . however, as pointed out in previous reports, findings such as described in the current study do not preclude a potential clinical benefit of masitinib therapy either as a single agent targeting tumor-related angiogenesis, or perhaps more importantly, as a potential chemosensitizer  <cit> .

to begin to investigate the potential role of either masitinib or imatinib as chemosensitizers in cof, we performed mts assays using a range of doxorubicin concentrations, with or without  <dig>  μm of either tki. this concentration of tki was chosen because pharmacokinetic studies in healthy beagle dogs have shown that a clinically-relevant oral dose of 10 mg/kg of masitinib results in a serum maximum concentration of  <dig> – <dig>  μm  <cit> . our data support an in vitro synergistic effect of either tki with doxorubicin in both cell lines, although the effect was modest. the potential for myelosuppression, or other side-effects, may be increased when tkis are combined with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents in vivo, as shown in a study evaluating the safety of toceranib combined with vinblastine in dogs with mast cell tumors  <cit> . maximal sensitization factors, potential alterations in drug pharmacokinetics, and alternative methods for determining pharmacologic synergism were not considered as they extend beyond the scope of the present study, but may form the basis for future investigations.

as pdgfr-β was found to be the most uniformly expressed receptor tyrosine kinase for tki targeting in the present study, we chose to further investigate the contribution of pdgfr-β signaling to viability of cof cell lines. knockdown of pdgfr-β protein expression via sirna transfection was successful in both cell lines. the effect of this pdgfr-β protein reduction was associated with a significant reduction in cell viability in both cell lines as well as visibly apparent degenerative changes in cellular morphology. this suggests that pdgfr-β signaling plays a partial role in maintaining viability of cof cells, but the overall significance of this single signaling pathway to cof cell survival requires further investigation.

although a thorough discussion of the mechanism of action of imatinib and masitinib is beyond the scope of this report, a few select points are worth highlighting. both tkis are considered small molecule inhibitors that selectively interfere with specific receptor tyrosine kinase activity   <cit> . through occupying the receptor’s active site, thereby blocking receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, tkis prevent subsequent activation of downstream pathways. depending on the cell’s dependence on the targeted pathways, this may result in cell death  <cit> . some tkis, such as masitinib, have shown an anticancer action that extends beyond inhibition of its primary targets, and may include disruption of additional signaling pathways associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance  <cit> . the in vivo tumor microenvironment is characterized by varying levels of hypoxia and acidity, which influence tumor cell behavior and drug sensitivity, potentially rendering them more or less sensitive to tki treatment  <cit> . pdgfr is emerging as a key regulator of mesenchymal cells within the tumor microenvironment of many common human malignancies  <cit> . blockade of pdgfr signaling has been shown to reduce metastasis in in vivo murine models of colorectal and prostate cancers . these points serve to illustrate some of the impetus behind this study’s investigations into the use of tkis as a potential treatment strategy, although their applicability to imatinib and/or masitinib treatment of cof remain unknown at this time.

the primary limitations of the present study center on its in vitro nature and the limited experimental methods used. this study tested for receptor tyrosine kinase expression but did not evaluate receptor phosphorylation status , receptor over- or under-expression, or effect of ligand stimulation on the receptors present. the presence of tki targets does not necessarily imply their requirement for cell survival or a gain-of-function structural aberration conferring malignant behavior. this study evaluated effects of tki treatment on cof cell line viability using an mts assay, supplemented with an apoptosis assay for select drug concentrations, representing only a partial evaluation of potential tki effects. examples of additional treatment effects that could be examined in future studies include cof cell migration and/or metastasis. finally, it is difficult to extrapolate in vitro results of tki treatment to the far more complex in vivo scenario that includes interactions with the tumor microenvironment and the host immune system.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study identified expression of pdgfr-α and –β in cof tumor biopsies and cell lines. treatment with masitinib or imatinib yielded in vitro reductions in cell viability which was enhanced synergistically by the addition of doxorubicin. furthermore, the tested cof cell lines exhibited partial pdgfr-β dependency for survival. taken together, these data support further investigation into the potential use of tkis, potentially in combination with doxorubicin, to augment existing treatment options for cof.
