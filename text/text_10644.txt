BACKGROUND
despite numerous investigations of the structure and dynamics of the plant mitochondrial  genome over the last decades, little is known about whether patterns of dna sequence variation are associated with variation in transcription products in plants from natural populations. unlike animals that possess a small, compact, gene-dense, circular mt genome, land plants have mt genome which is organized as a collection of circular and linear molecules of various sizes  <cit> . plant mt genomes are known to rapidly change copy number and gene order, which results in insertions and deletions in both functional and non functional regions. the occasional coexistence of at least two different copies of mt dna in the same individual, which is termed heteroplasmy, creates the opportunity for recombination or re-association among different mt lineages  <cit> .

the transcription of plant mt genes is complex and well characterized in only a few model systems. transcription is performed by a phage-type rna polymerase encoded by the nucleus  <cit>  and the presence of multiple promoters is a common feature of plant mt genes  <cit> . splicing, editing and processing of transcript termini are all involved in maturation of mrna in plant mitochondria  <cit> . moreover, self-splicing group ii introns are present in at least ten plant mt protein coding genes. variation in the sizes of transcripts from the same mt gene has been found in several studies  <cit> . mt rna profiles have been shown to depend on the developmental stage of the plant  <cit>  and transcription profiles have been found to be species or lineage specific in wheat, rye, triticale, and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . additionally, differences in mt gene transcription and translation between females and hermaphrodites have been used to discover candidate genes for cytoplasmic male sterility   <cit> . to date, however, there has been very little investigation of naturally occurring variation in transcript sizes and whether this variation is related to mt genome arrangements for any species.

silene vulgaris, a eurasian short-lived perennial, exhibits a wide range of sex ratios in natural populations and has become a model for studies of the population genetic consequences of gynodioecy  <cit> . diversity in the mt genome in natural populations is better characterized for s. vulgaris than in any other plant species  <cit> . mt dna markers  have been applied, for example, to demonstrate a high polymorphism of s. vulgaris in the usa  <cit>  and central europe  <cit> . the high level of rflp polymorphism is accompanied by very high substitution rates in coding regions of some mt genes  <cit> . high nucleotide diversity is also associated with the gynodioecious reproduction system in the genus silene  <cit> , although no cms related gene has been discovered in silene.

we hypothesize that there may be causal links between mitochondrial rearrangements and variation in transcription profiles. regulatory motifs are often located in the gene flanking regions, which are frequently the sites of intra- or inter-genomic rearrangements  <cit> . these rearrangements could lead to the changes in gene transcription patterns. for this reason, we investigated whether polymorphism in mt dna is associated with polymorphism in gene transcription profiles. we know of no study to date that has documented variation in transcription profiles of plant mt genes in natural populations. although the mt genome is primarily maternally inherited  <cit> , rare paternal inheritance of the mt genome has been described in natural populations of s. vulgaris  <cit> . this phenomenon offers opportunity to correlate transcription profiles and genetic background.

in the present study we investigate whether transcript profiles of two mt genes correlate with mt dna haplotypes. the cox <dig> and atp <dig> genes were chosen based on the previous reports of their high polymorphism in s. vulgaris  <cit> . we describe mt dna variation and transcription profiles of the cox <dig> and atp <dig> genes in offspring of maternal plants collected from one highly diverse population of s. vulgaris in central europe. we also compare transcript patterns of the two genes between the genders with the aim of identification of possible candidates for cms genes in s. vulgaris.

RESULTS
variation in dna patterns among families
two methods were adopted to analyze mt dna variation in s. vulgaris: 1) southern-rflp's, which screened rflp variation in regions flanking the atp <dig> and cox <dig> genes, and 2) pcr-rflps that screened rflp variation in the coding regions of the same genes. among  <dig> offspring distributed across  <dig> families  of s. vulgaris originating from kovary meadows near prague , southern hybridization revealed  <dig> different rflp haplotypes in the cox <dig> flanking regions  and  <dig> different haplotypes in the atp <dig> flanking regions . additional faint bands were observed in nearly all rflp patterns  in at least one combination probe/restriction enzyme. the cox <dig> southern-rflp haplotype c <dig> matched the haplotype l described from a previous study in the same population  <cit> , but all other southern-rflps differed from those previously described  <cit> .

sequencing of coding regions revealed  <dig> cox <dig> variants  and  <dig> atp <dig> variants  , which were also distinguishable by restriction digestion of pcr fragments. twenty one nucleotide sequence differences were identified within the  <dig> bp alignment of the  <dig> atp <dig> haplotypes. haplotype kova, present in the kov <dig> and kov <dig> families, differed from the haplotypes kovb and kovc by  <dig> and  <dig> differences, respectively. three of these nucleotide sequence differences were non-synonymous. in contrast, the cox <dig> sequences were very similar - haplotypes kova' and kovb' differed by two synonymous nucleotide differences within  <dig> bp. all atp <dig> and cox <dig> sequences matched at least one record previously deposited in genbank. for instance, the sequence of the atp <dig> haplotype kovb was identical with the atp <dig> haplotype a  described in  <cit> .

the families originated from ten maternal plants growing in kovary meadows . families comprising at least one individual differing from mother or siblings in mt dna markers are marked .

non-maternal transmission of organellar markers
three individuals were identified that differed from their siblings and maternal parents in mt dna haplotypes. for instance, individuals in lanes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in figure  <dig> are siblings from the kov <dig> mother. individuals  <dig> and  <dig> carried the same mt type as their mother, but the individual in lane  <dig>  carried different mt haplotype. another example was individuals in lanes  <dig> and  <dig> in figure  <dig>  although these siblings were grown from seeds collected from the kov <dig> mother, the mt haplotype of the individual in lane  <dig>  did not match that of the mother. finally, one plant in the kov <dig> family  was identical to its siblings except for a unique cox <dig> southern rflp pattern that did not correspond to any other haplotype in this study. because the mother plants shared mt markers with the majority of offspring and the southern-rflp band intensity was strong in all cases, we interpret these patterns as either evidence of paternal transmission from unknown pollen donor in natural population, or a sudden increase in genome copy number by means of lineage sorting or substoichiometric shifting.

the presence of a unique smai restriction site allowed us to apply the knock-back approach introduced by  <cit>  to verify whether the unique atp <dig> haplotype in the progeny from the mother kov <dig> was present in a low frequency in the mother as well. the amplification of maternal dna, pre-digested with smai, generated no bands; a result that can be interpreted as an absence of the progeny haplotype in the kov <dig> mother and favors the paternal transmission hypothesis for this case. suitable restriction sites in atp <dig> genes were absent in remaining two cases of different haplotypes in families, preventing application of "knock-back" approach. based on these results we estimate the rate of paternal transmission in kovary meadows to be between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % .

heteroplasmy in the kov <dig> and kov <dig> families
we also applied the knock-back approach to address the presence of heteroplasmy in all of the progeny from the two families that carried atp <dig> haplotype kova . seven individuals  in the kov <dig> family carried low copy numbers of the atp <dig> allele without the smai site that is present in haplotype kova. because the mother plant kov <dig> was homoplasmic for kova, these copies were most likely paternally transmitted. eighteen plants  from the kov <dig> family also contained an additional atp <dig> variant in low copy number. because the mother plant  <dig> also was heteroplasmic, we can estimate that 54% of siblings in kov <dig> family lost the rare non-kova atp <dig> allele through genetic drift and mitochondrial sorting within or across generations.

the two families with the atp <dig> haplotype kova  also showed variation in southern rflp of atp <dig> among progeny. while the major bands of the rflp patterns were uniform, additional bands of the same or fainter intensity appeared in some progeny, but not in others. four individuals with an extra band as intense as the major bands were found among  <dig> siblings in the kov <dig> family and  <dig> individuals with an extra band slightly fainter than the major bands were found among  <dig> siblings in the kov <dig> family. variation in southern-rflp band intensities was also observed in all the families. for instance, the strength of the  <dig>  kb ecori fragment corresponding to the atp <dig> gene varied in kov <dig>  kov <dig> and kov <dig> families . another example is hindiii and ecori cox <dig> southern rflp of the members of the kov <dig> family, with varying intensities of the second band .

within-individual dna variation
southern-rflp patterns from leaf tissues collected from two different stems on the same plant were analyzed from  <dig> plants in the kov <dig> sibship . within-individual differences in plants <dig> and  <dig> are clearly visible in figure  <dig>  for example, the intensity of band  <dig> differs seven-fold between two branches of plant  <dig> and there was a two-fold difference in band intensity for band  <dig> on different stems from plant  <dig>  in all, we detected within-individual band intensity variation in  <dig> of  <dig> plants screened from the kov <dig> family. these results indicate the strong potential for sorting of different mitochondrial genomes into different branches during plant development to cause changes in the copy number mt genomes in different stems of the same plant. the branches differing in southern-rflp profiles produced flowers of the same gender.

transcription profiles of mt genes
to investigate variation in mt transcript patterns in s. vulgaris we performed northern hybridizations. figure 3a demonstrates differences in transcription profiles of atp <dig> across the families. all individuals showed a strong band at  <dig>  kb. in addition, plants from the kov <dig> and  <dig> families  displayed an additional strong band about  <dig>  kb. additional weak bands occurred in all the individuals except for members of the kov <dig> family, all of which possessed just one visible  <dig>  kb band.

the additional bands showed variable intensities among the members of the same family, and their presence or absence was sometimes hard to confirm. therefore, we chose the presence/absence of  <dig>  kb extra band to define the atp <dig> transcription profile, as this character was highly reproducible. the cox <dig> profile  also showed variation in transcription patterns among individuals .

the transcription of mt genes starts from multiple promoters and primary transcripts undergo a complex maturation process  <cit> ; therefore, we wondered whether the  <dig>  kb atp <dig> band was associated with a specific dna haplotype or arose as a result of the different developmental changes leading to floral buds in different individuals. we extracted total rna from the floral buds of various sizes  from  <dig> individuals from the kov <dig> family and  <dig> plants from the kov <dig> family. as shown in figure 5a, all but one plant shared the  <dig>  kb band. interestingly, the plant without the  <dig>  kb band also differed from its siblings in mt dna southern-rflp patterns, indicating, perhaps, co-paternal inheritance of both the mt dna and transcriptional machinery . similar patterns of transcription profiles were observed after rehybridization of the same membrane with a cox <dig> probe . different atp <dig> and coxi transcription profiles were reproducibly associated with the atp <dig> pcr-rflp dna haplotype kova, occurring in the kov <dig> and kov <dig> families . the among-individual variation in minor southern-rflp bands  were not correlated with specific atp <dig> transcription profile. another individual differing in both mt dna haplotype and transcription profile from its siblings was found in the family kov <dig>  this plant shared dna haplotype and transcription pattern with kov <dig> .

we compared atp <dig> transcription profiles between  <dig> females and  <dig> hermaphroditic plants from kov <dig> and kov <dig> families, which inherited mt genomes from their mothers. an extra atp <dig>  <dig>  kb band was present in all of them, but its intensity in relation to the  <dig>  kb band varied . the relative strength of the atp <dig>  <dig>  kb transcript did not correlate with gender. thus, the presence of the atp <dig>  <dig>  kb band was associated with the mt dna haplotype and not gender, whereas its abundance was influenced by unknown factor.

discussion
trancription profiles correlate with mt dna haplotypes
we have shown that variation in transcription profiles for atp <dig> and cox <dig> were correlated with mt dna sequence variation in individuals from a single population of s. vulgaris in central czech republic. these associations are strong. the only individual that showed transcription profiles different from its siblings among  <dig> members of kov <dig> and kov <dig> families  also differed from its siblings in all mt dna markers analyzed. a similar association between mt dna haplotype and transcript profile was also found in a progeny in the kov <dig> family which shared both haplotype and transcript pattern with kov <dig> family. this within-family variation in transcription profiles and mt dna sequence likely resulted from rare paternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome in these individuals and suggests that factors in the mitochondrial genome have regulatory influences on the mitochondrial genes than can be co-inherited. we caution, however, that because the maternal plants were field pollinated and we do not know pollen donors, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the individuals with paternally transmitted mt genome also inherited nuclear gene responsible for different transcription patterns.

little is known about the mechanisms generating variation in mitochondrial gene transcription profiles. one potential mechanism for generating this variation is the rearrangement of the mt genome to move coding regions to a position proximate to a different promoter, resulting in novel mrna types. for example, additional start sites, introduced by dna rearrangements, were responsible for altered transcript sizes of six mt genes in beta vulgaris  <cit> . additionally, variation in 5' mrna ends was responsible for transcript polymorphism in a. thaliana  <cit> . finally, co-transcription of nad <dig> with an unknown orf led to the generation of a large transcript occurring in a cms lineage of mimulus guttatus  <cit> .

the transcription pattern of mt genes may also vary with the developmental stage  <cit> , however, our observations did not support this process because rna extracted from the flower buds of various ages from the individuals of the same haplotype shared a similar transcription profile. we recognize that our study does not conclusively prove that transcriptional patterns of mt dna genes cannot change through the course of development as a result of mitochondrial rearrangements. if mitochondrial rearrangements during development are quite rare, it may require a serendipitous circumstance to detect the correlated changes in mt gene rearrangements and transcriptional patterns.

we also found no association between gender and the transcription pattern. the same number of bands was found in the cox <dig> and atp <dig> transcript profiles of females and hermaphrodites in all families and the relative intensities of particular bands did not differ in a consistent manner between females and hermaphrodites. thus we did not find differential transcription between the two genders which would relate particular transcripts to cms  <cit> . at the same time we cannot exclude, that some of the cox <dig> and atp <dig> genes are involved in cms and their expression is regulated in gender-specific manner as described in  <cit> .

paternal transmission of mt genome
because the plants grown from the field pollinated seed had unknown fathers, we could not provide direct evidence for paternal transmission of mt markers by comparing the mt genotypes between progeny and the father. instead, we assume that paternal inheritance was responsible for the mt haplotype of the particular plant if  the mt dna markers of this individual differed from its siblings, if  its mt pcr-rflp haplotype was not present in maternal plant even in trace amount, and if  it differed in all mt markers analyzed, which made paternal inheritance more parsimonious explanation than substoichiometric shifting  <cit> .

we observed two individuals  that differed from their siblings in all mt markers; another plant  differed in cox <dig> southern-rflp only. because "knock-back" methods  <cit>  found no heteroplasmy in the kov <dig> mother, the different mt dna haplotypes in kov <dig> family could not have been inherited from the mother. therefore, paternal transmission was the simplest explanation. the lack of suitable restriction sites prevented similar tests in the remaining two plants. we could therefore apply all the above mentioned criteria to the one individual only , while the paternal inheritance in remaining two plants could not be either confirmed or excluded. the occurrence of 1- <dig> individuals  among  <dig> offspring is comparable to 4% of non-maternal offspring revealed among  <dig> s. vulgaris plants by  <cit> . rare paternal inheritance  of mt markers in a natural population of s. vulgaris has been recently documented by  <cit> .

heteroplasmy does not influence transcription profiles
we interpret the results of our pcr-rflp knock-back experiments and the presence of multiple bands in southern banding patterns as evidence of mitochondrial heteroplasmy within individuals. multiple bands in the southern-rflp profiles might also have been derived from additional gene copies, partial non-functional duplications, or from chimeric genes  <cit> . besides major bands, faint to moderately strong bands were present in nearly all southern-rflp patterns; we interpret these weaker bands as low-copy molecules of mt dna  <cit> . moreover, differences in southern-rflp banding patterns between the branches of the same plant were dramatic. we suggest that such variation in frequencies of different markers arose from random sorting of mt genomes during vegetative growth of heteroplasmic individual  <cit> . however, rearrangements of mt dna by a process similar to substoichiometric shifting  <cit>  during development cannot be completely excluded. we found no variation in transcript profiles that were associated with heteroplasmy. however, our northern hybridization experiments detected mt transcripts in total rna, without distinguishing the relative contribution of specific mt genomes of the same individual. the differentiation and quantification of the transcripts derived from various mt genomes could be achieved by means of qrt pcr with specific primers and probes. such experiments will contribute to a better understanding the consequences of heteroplasmy in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
our study of offspring from a single natural population of a gynodioecious species s. vulgaris revealed specific association of the transcription profiles of mt genes with mt dna markers. the transcription profiles were not influenced by environment, but correlated with mt dna haplotypes. we also did not detect any association between the gender and the transcription profile, which would suggest the role of a specific transcript in associated with differential cms gene expression in the two genders. we found high between-family and limited within-family variation of mt dna markers in the offspring under study. within-sibship variation was attributable to paternal inheritance, lineage sorting or maybe to the rearrangement of mt dna by recombination. our results demonstrate that transcription of mt genes in s. vulgaris is very complex. our studies indicate that naturally occurring mitochondrial rearrangements may have functional consequences in plants. it remains to be shown how variation in transcription may influence morphology or other fitness-related traits. an entire mt transcriptome should be considered to understand the role of mitochondria in determining a gender in this gynodioecious species.
