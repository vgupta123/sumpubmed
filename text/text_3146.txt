BACKGROUND
nitrile hydratase  is composed of α- and β-subunits. the enzyme contains either a non-heme iron   <cit>  or non-corrin cobalt ion   <cit>  in the active center and catalyzes the hydration of a nitrile to the corresponding amide, which is followed by several consecutive reactions: amide → acid → acyl-coa, as catalyzed by amidase  <cit>  and acyl-coa synthetase  <cit> , respectively. the metal ions in both co-nhase and fe-nhase are located in their α-subunits, which share a characteristic metal-binding motif  containing two modified cysteine residues: cysteine-sulfinic acid  and cysteine-sulfenic acid   <cit> . the apoenzyme is likely to be unmodified, according to previous studies on nhase  <cit>  and a related enzyme, thiocyanate hydrolase   <cit> .

the trafficking of metal ions into nhases is mediated by various “activator proteins”  <cit> . fe-nhases require activators for functional expression in rhodococcus sp. n- <dig>  <cit> , pseudomonas chlororaphis b <dig>  <cit>  and rhodococcus sp. n- <dig>  <cit> . a proposed metal-binding motif, cxcc, in the nhase activator of rhodococcus sp. n- <dig> has been identified and the activators for fe-type nhases have been shown to act as metallochaperones  <cit> . for the two co-nhases  in rhodococcus rhodochrous j <dig>  cobalt incorporation has been found to be dependent on self-subunit swapping: the activator protein exists as a complex with the α-subunit of nhase, the cobalt incorporation involves the swapping of the cobalt-free α-subunit of the cobalt-free nhase with the cobalt-containing α-subunit of the complex  <cit> . nhase in pseudomonas putida nrrl- <dig> and acetonitrile hydratase  from rhodococcus jostii rha <dig> are also co-nhases, in which p14k and anhe, respectively, are essential for nhase maturation  <cit> . however, their gene organizations are quite different from those of l-nhase and h-nhase. the structural genes of l-nhase and h-nhase have the order < β-subunit > <α-subunit > <self-subunit swapping chaperone>, while those in anhase and the nhase of p. putida nrrl- <dig> have the order < α-subunit > <anhe > <β-subunit >  <cit>  and < α-subunit > <β-subunit > <p14k >  <cit> , respectively, with the latter protein being identical to the metallochaperone in fe-nhase except that the molecular mass of the protein in fe-nhase is larger than p14k. while anhe has been found to act as a metallochaperone  during cobalt incorporation into anhase  <cit> , very recently, we discovered that cobalt incorporation into the nhase of p. putida nrrl- <dig> is also dependent on the self-subunit swapping, and the p14k is a complex with the α-subunit  <cit> . however, the p14k is difficult to be heterogeneously expressed, though a strep tag containing p14k was expressed, its low expression level and low stability retard the further clarification of their detailed role for cobalt incorporation.

heterologous expression systems are commonly used for protein research. protein degradation in heterologous expression systems often leads to failure for the isolation of proteins of interest. intracellular protein degradation plays an essential role in many physiological processes by removing damaged polypeptides and proteins that harbor specific destruction tags. n-end pathway degradation relates the metabolic stability of a protein to the n-terminal residue of that protein  <cit> . the n-end rule defines the stability of proteins according to the nature of their n-terminal residues. these residues are classified as stabilizing and destabilizing residues, which serve as recognition determinants for protein degradation  <cit> . in bacteria such as e. coli, the n-end rule pathway is present. according to the n-end rule, amino-terminal arginine, lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan confer 2 minute half-lives to proteins, while the other amino-terminal residues confer greater than 10 hour half-lives to the same proteins   <cit> .

in the present study, we successfully expressed the nhase activator p14k through site-specific mutagenesis taking into account n-end rule degradation. we also increased the expression and the stability of p14k by fusion of a pelb leader and strep tag together at its n-terminus. these results are useful for elucidation of the mechanism of cobalt incorporation into the α-subunit of nhase in p. putida nrrl- <dig>  furthermore, these strategies, which promote the over-expression of the instable p14k in e. coli, might also be helpful for the heterologous expression of other difficult expression proteins.

RESULTS
molecular modification to improve the yield of p14k from p. putida nrrl-18668
to clarify the mechanism of cobalt incorporation into the nhase of p. putida nrrl- <dig>  we attempted to isolate p14k, which is essential for nhase activity  <cit> . the transformant harboring pet-abp, which contained the nhase and p14k genes, was used for nhase and p14k expression. as a result, although nhase was successfully expressed, p14k was hardly detected on sds-page. this result is consistent with the previous report  <cit> . although a strep tag containing p14k was expressed using a transformant harboring pet-ab, and the strep-p14k was found to be a complex with the α-subunit   <cit> , the low expression level and the low stability of the complex retard the further clarification of its detailed role for cobalt incorporation, a strategy for enhancing p14k expression level and stability is expected. it has been shown that heterologous expression of proteins in e. coli can be enhanced by using a synthetically strong ribosome binding site   <cit> , reducing the distance between the promoter region and target gene  <cit>  and gene codon optimization  <cit> . to enhance the expression of p14k, the putative rbs  within the b gene   was replaced with an enhanced rbs  between gene b and gene p  during the construction of the plasmid pet-ab’p . simultaneously, the plasmid pet-pab, with the gene order < p > <a > <b>, was constructed. in this plasmid, the distance between the promoter sequence and the p14k gene was shortened and the strong rbs was inserted upstream of each gene . moreover, plasmid pet-abpo, with optimized p14k gene codons and a strong rbs for each gene, was also constructed . however, p14k was not abundantly expressed by the transformants harboring pet-ab’p, pet-pab or pet-abpo .

successful heterologous expression of p14k
the n-end rule states that the half-life of a protein is determined by the nature of its n-terminal residue  <cit> . this fundamental principle of proteolytic regulation is conserved from bacteria to mammals  <cit> . n-terminal arginine, lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan confer 2 minute half-lives to proteins, while the other n-terminal residues confer greater than 10 hour half-lives to the same proteins  <cit>  . we analyzed the n-terminal amino-acids of some weakly expressed nhase activators from bordetella petrii dsm  <dig>  p. putida nrrl- <dig>  bacillus br <dig> and bacillus rapc <dig>  surprisingly, we found that all of the second n-terminal amino-acids of the nhase activators in these four strains are lysine  . thus, it may be that n-end rule degradation leads to difficulty with the expression and isolation of p14k. based on this speculation, we designed a mutant gene, abp, in which the lys- <dig> in the n-terminus of p14k was substituted with ala in the plasmid pet-abp. in addition, we analyzed the secondary structure of the p14k as predicted by jpred <dig>  and found the n-terminal  <dig> amino-acid group is in an n-terminal loop  and the 17th amino-acid is a gly that could avoid p14k degradation effectively according the n-end rule  <cit> . therefore, we constructed plasmid pet-ab, in which the n-terminal  <dig> residues of p14k were deleted, the second n-terminal amino-acid in the truncated p14k was gly. the transformants harboring pet-abp and pet-ab were used for nhase and p14k expression. as shown in figure 4c, each mutant p14k was successfully expressed and the crude nhase activity in the cell-free extracts of each transformant was similar to that of the transformant harboring pet-abp . however, compared with the expression of p14k using the transformant harboring pet-ab, the expression level of p14k in the two mutants was not improved .

protein accession numbers are shown in brackets. * the correct n-terminal amino-acid sequence of p14k was identified by our previous work  <cit> .

high p14k expression yield
it has been reported that exporting a protein to the periplasm to enhance its stability can be regarded as an effective strategy to optimize the production of recombinant proteins  <cit> . to yield large amounts of p14k in recombinant e. coli cells, we attempted to secrete p14k into the periplasmic space. as p14k formed a complex with the α-subunit of nhase  <cit> , we designed a mutant gene b in which the pelb signal peptide was added upstream of the a and strep-p genes in the plasmid pet22b-b. the transformant harboring pet22b-b was used for recombinant p14k expression. although no target protein was observed in the culture supernatant, a large amount of the full-length pelb-strep-p14k and pelb-α subunit  were detected in the cell-free extract . in addition, the enzyme activity in the cell-free extract was comparable to that of the wild-type nhase.

stability of pelb-strep-p14k
to investigate the mechanism of how the fusion protein pelb-strep enhances the recombinant expression of p14k, we compared the difference in the protein stability between the purified p14k-containing activator complex  and . sds-page analysis was carried to investigate the stability of cobalt-containing  and   during storage at room temperature. as shown in figure 5b, the pelb-strep-p14k band from the recombinant  complex decayed to 90% of the original intensity after 2 days of storage and eventually to 60% after 6 days. however, the strep-p14k band from the  complex decreased to 60% after only 1 day of storage and to 10% after 2 days. the finding that pelb-strep-p14k is far more stable than strep-p14k indicated that thermal stability may be a key factor in p14k expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the activator p14k from p. putida nrrl- <dig> was successfully expressed based on the n-end rule degradation, the stability of the p14k was improved by adding a pelb signal peptide. further study of the influence of p14k on the maturation of nhase is currently underway. the strategy used for p14k expression in this study may be useful for the heterologous expression of other difficult expression proteins.
