BACKGROUND
cotton plants  produce the most widely used textile fiber in the world. moreover, the cotton seed is used to feed livestock and its oil is important in biodiesel production and human consumption. in  <dig>  more than half world cotton area was planted with genetically modified  cotton, which occupied  <dig>  million hectares   <cit> . up to date, around  <dig> cotton events have been approved, in which insect-resistant trait is one of most used and spread, behind only of herbicide tolerance or both traits combined  <cit> .

despite significant efforts towards the isolation and characterization of plant genes, only a reduced number of plant promoters have been isolated and functionally characterized  <cit> . the most widely used general-purpose promoter in gm plants is the cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter  <cit> , used in more than 80% of gm plants  <cit>  because of its constitutively high levels of transgene expression  <cit> . however, the stability and expression patterns of foreign genes driven by the camv35s promoter, including genes expressed in cotton  <cit> , have been widely debated  <cit> . moreover, the combination of different traits like drought and cold tolerance, bacteria, fungi and nematode resistance, requires different promoter activities not only to avoid transgene silencing, but also to target the expression to different tissues or developmental stages. up to date, around  <dig> different promoters have been used and evaluated in gm cotton varieties, usually chimeric products from viral and/or agrobacterium promoters, with  <dig> being derived from maize or arabidopsis promoters  <cit> . therefore, the discovery and characterization of additional plant promoters is essential to a better understanding of transgene expression in gm plant development with predictable high level, temporal and tissue-specific expression patterns  <cit> .

the ubiquitination-related genes have been reported to display high levels of expression across several plant tissues  <cit> , provided that ubiquitination is a major posttranslational protein modification, which is based on the addition of one or multiple ubiquitin molecules to the lysine residues of substrate proteins  <cit> . ubiquitination plays important roles in the regulation of lipidation, protein activity, protein-protein interactions, subcellular protein localization  <cit> , transcriptional regulation , translational regulation, dna repair, endocytosis and protein turnover and trafficking  <cit> .

ubiquitination-related gene promoters isolated from arabidopsis  <cit> , sunflower  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and several other crops can drive the expression of reporter genes in transformed cells or plants. previous studies have reported that the expression pattern of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes  is differentially regulated across tissues and developmental stages  <cit> .

therefore, the main goal of this study is the evaluation of the expression pattern of a non-characterized cotton ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme -related gene in order to isolate a novel promoter with different properties. in this study, we report the identification of the gland development related protein  <dig>  ghgdrp <dig> gene, a member of the e <dig> family that presents a high level of transcript accumulation in several cotton tissues. the ghgdrp <dig> regulatory region, hereby named ucea <dig>   and promoter named uceapro <dig>  was isolated and its gus expression pattern characterized in transgenic arabidopsis. the data generated in this study indicate that ucea <dig>  has potential to be a reliable alternative to the camv35s promoter and its variations to be applied in gm crop generation programs.

RESULTS
root preferential expression of an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme related gene in cotton plants
aiming the identification and the isolation of a novel cotton promoter, a search was performed in the genbank for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  family members. the search resulted in seven e <dig> sequences, retrieved from four different cotton species. a multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed that six of the identified sequences are closely related with high scores  and low e-values . however, one sequence deposited as 'gossypium hirsutum gland development related protein 85-like mrna'  showed a slightly lower score and a higher e-value than all the analyzed e <dig> sequences. no reports were found in regards to ghgdrp <dig> protein. due to its relatively high identity with the cotton e2s , we selected it as a good candidate and carried out further analysis.

multiple nucleotide sequence alignment showed a 247-bp insertion in ghgdrp <dig> gene . the nucleotides flanking the insertion are similar to exon-exon junctions in all six other analyzed e <dig> sequences, which strongly suggests that an intron in ghgdrp <dig> is not removed during rna splicing. furthermore, the putative not processed intron includes a stop codon rendering a truncated e <dig> homologue, missing the active cysteine residue site , which may block ubiquitin transfer. this observation prompted us to investigate the expression pattern of the ghgdrp <dig> gene.

specific primers for qpcr were designed, in which the reverse primer annealed to the putative not processed intron , allowing us to analyze the possibility of its retention and to assay the expression pattern of ghgdrp <dig> gene without interference from the other homologue mrnas that share high sequence identity.

the qpcr analysis  employed ghubq <dig> and ghpp2a <dig> as reference genes  because of their high stability  <cit> . ghgdrp <dig> transcripts are at least  <dig> times more abundant than reference genes in all analyzed tissues. in roots, ghgdrp <dig> transcripts accumulated approximately 200-fold more than the reference genes.

due to the fact that cotton flowers are targets of severe cotton pests, such as the cotton boll weevil , it was necessary to gain information in regards to the expression patterns in floral organs. the four floral verticils , as well as the pedicel of 6-mm flower buds, were harvested and dissected. in this case, the data were normalized to the ghact <dig> and ghfbx <dig> reference genes due to its higher stability in flower tissues  <cit> . the analysis revealed similar ghgdrp <dig> transcript levels in all flower verticils, indicating its regulatory region as a potential alternative to the camv35s to direct strong gene expression to floral tissues .

isolation of the uceapro <dig> promoter and its 5'utr from cotton plants
because of the ghgdrp <dig> interesting expression pattern, we proceeded with the isolation of its regulatory region as a potential candidate for biotechnological use. the regulatory sequence upstream to ghgdrp <dig> was amplified by tail-pcr  <cit> , using alternating rounds of high and low stringency to amplify specific products preferentially over non-specific products. an  <dig> -kb fragment named ucea <dig>   was cloned  and sequenced. alignment of this cloned sequence showed an overlap of the 3' end of the isolated sequence with the 5' end of the ghgdrp <dig> mrna. the 5' end of the cloned sequence contained no open reading frames and no significant identity to any previously described promoters.

the sequence of the isolated regulatory region was analyzed to predict the core promoter and cis-elements using the plantcare software . plantcare predicted four caat-boxes and  <dig> tata-boxes. the most probable combination of caat-box and tata-box was selected according to the common promoter pattern, also considering predicted transcription start site , following the y patch and yr rules  <cit> . using this strategy, the region of the core promoter was therefore predicted  as one functional group. based on these predictions, the core promoter plus its upstream 325-bp region was isolated and named uceapro <dig> . the rationale behind the isolation of these two sequences was the assessment of the 5'utr influence in the expression pattern of the uceapro <dig> promoter, provided that 5'utrs have been reported to enhance the expression levels of reporter genes in previous studies  <cit> . in addition, ucea <dig>  contains several putative functional cis-regulatory elements, boxed in figure  <dig> and briefly described in table  <dig>

the sequence alignment between ucea <dig>  and the ghgdrp <dig> mrna reveals the existence of an intron in the 5'utr . this intron is flanked by nucleotides that match with junction motifs, and the intronic sequence is spliced  <dig> bp upstream of the translation initiation codon. the presence of an intron in the ghgdrp <dig> 5'utr provides an indication that it may contain important cis-elements involved on intron-mediated enhancement  of gene expression  <cit> .

functional characterization of ucea <dig> 
to analyze the tissue expression pattern directed by the ucea <dig>  regulatory sequence in a heterologous system, gm arabidopsis plants harboring three different promoter:reporter gene constructs were generated. the duplicated camv35s with the alfalfa mosaic virus enhancer   <cit> , ucea <dig>  and uceapro <dig> were individually inserted into pcambia <dig> upstream of the uida gene coding region followed by the tnos terminator . a quantitative assessment of Î²-glucuronidase  activity was measured using a fluorometric assay with protein extracts from leaf, stem, floral bud and root tissues. all three sequences drove gus expression in all four tissues examined .

the levels of gus activity directed by ucea <dig>  and 35sdamv were quite similar in leaf  and stem  tissues. however, ucea <dig>  drove a 2-fold higher level of gus expression in roots and about 7-fold higher level in floral buds compared to the widely used 35sdamv . moreover, ucea <dig>  drove around  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 7-fold higher expression levels in leaves, stems, floral buds and roots, respectively, compared to uceapro <dig>  the uceapro <dig> promoter directed basal gus expression mainly in vascular tissues, such as the vascular cambia and leaf veins , whereas ucea <dig>  showed strong and well-distributed expression in all tissues and organs.

discussion
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes  are known to show both spatial and temporal regulated expression, because their role in ubiquitination process, which can be associated to different molecular, cellular and physiological processes. with the goal of identifying a promoter and/or a regulatory region in cotton with new properties, we first analyzed gossypium spp e <dig> family in genbank. among the seven members found, one of them  seems to be a truncated version of the e <dig> homologues due to a premature stop codon. the stop codon is present in an uncommon region that seems to be an unspliced intron. indeed, the ghgdrp <dig> mrna possesses an internal 274-bp sequence that is spliced as an intron in an alternative gossypium e <dig> transcript. this data was confirmed by qpcr using a reverse primer annealing in this region. the premature termination of ghgdrp <dig> protein prevents the conserved cysteine residue  of the active site responsible for ubiquitin transfer to be encoded  <cit> . the truncated e <dig> protein may act as a competitive inhibitor of the functional e <dig>  and thereby down-regulate the ubiquitination pathway. therefore, it seems that ghgdrp <dig> protein has evolved from e <dig> family, but as a result of alternative splicing that ultimately encodes a truncated e2-related protein. we observed intron junctions that could alternatively spliced over this 274-bp intron from the ghgdrp <dig> primary transcript under specific conditions, developmental stages and/or in certain tissue types. the alternative mrna encodes the cys <dig> along an e <dig> protein that shares very high sequence identity  with e <dig> family members, including ubc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

thus, the ghgdrp <dig> transcript abundance in cotton tissues was evaluated to verify its regulatory sequence activity and its biotechnology usefulness. the ghgdrp <dig> transcript abundance was approximately 10-fold greater than the reference genes ghpp2a <dig> and ghubq <dig> in four analyzed tissues . these results showed that the ghgdrp <dig> transcript is highly abundant in most cotton tissues, especially in roots, which the mrna levels are 200-fold higher than the reference genes .

to obtain further detail about the expression activity of the ghgdrp <dig> regulatory region, we isolated the corresponding upstream promoter  within the ghgdrp <dig> regulatory region . the activity and the spatial gene expression driven by the constructs ucea <dig> , uceapro <dig> and 35sdamv nucleotide sequences fused to the gus reporter were evaluated in the respective transgenic arabidopsis plants.

transgenic plants harboring uceapro2::gus present basal levels of gus activity in leaf, stem, flower bud and root, although gus activity in root was approximately 4-fold higher when compared to other tissues . the plantcare software did not identify any cis-acting element that would explain such high levels of expression in roots . therefore, further analyses are still needed to locate root-specific cis-acting elements.

the remarkable difference in expression levels  driven by the ucea <dig>  and uceapro <dig> constructs can be directly associated to the presence of the ghgdrp <dig> 5'utr. the presence of this region triggers an important quantitative effect, increasing from  <dig> to 15-fold expression in leaf, stem and flower bud tissues. in root the presence the 5'utr result in an increase of only 7-folds, however it is also possible that the detection sensitivity of the gus assay has reached its saturation point in the root tissues. on the other hand, some putative light-responsive cis-acting elements observed in 5'utr could be responsible for the higher gus expression in light-exposed tissues  and  in figure  <dig> and table 1).

in addition to the numerous regulatory elements present along the 5'utr to regulate the transcription process, this sequence may also possess other elements that increase favorable effects on mrna stability, processing, nucleus-cytoplasm translocation and translational apparatus assembly  <cit> , such as an intron just before the first exon that could characterize intron-mediated enhancement   <cit> . taken together, these findings suggest that the presence of the 5'utr downstream of the uceapro <dig> promoter likely accounts for the observed increase in expression levels driven by ucea <dig> . this phenomenon has already been described in previous reports of gene expression analyses in pea and conifers  <cit> .

the ucea <dig>  sequence drives gus expression to leaves and stems in comparable levels to the strong constitutive enhanced plant promoter camv35s. however, ucea <dig>  drives higher gus expression in roots  and flowers . 35sdamv:gus plants present a 10-fold decrease of gus expression in flower bud, relative to leaf. it is noteworthy that gus staining in leaf  driven by ucea <dig>  seems to be higher than that driven by camv35s. however this observation does not match to the quantitative fluorometric data presented on figure  <dig>  this kind of variance is commonly observed with gus staining assays. furthermore, the camv35s promoter, which has been widely used for plant expression systems, induces low and variable expression in floral organs  <cit> , rendering the production of plants expressing foreign genes on floral organs unpredictable. due to the reported reduced gene expression driven by camv35s promoter in different plants upon nematode infection  <cit> , we intend to perform the analyses of ucea <dig>  driven expression at nematode feeding sites.

the ghgdrp <dig> expression patterns in cotton plants are comparable to the gus expression assays in transgenic a. thaliana plants. despite of the similarity of expression levels measured in leaf, stem and flower tissues, the levels of ghgdrp <dig> transcript abundance in roots were much higher than the levels of gus measured in the fluorometric assays. if there is no gus detection limit threshold, we suggest that this difference might be due to the absence of cotton-specific trans-acting factors in arabidopsis. alternatively, the cloned ucea <dig>  sequence might not contain cis-acting enhancer elements that are located far up- or downstream and present in the native ghgdrp <dig> gene regulatory region.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the ucea <dig>  regulatory sequence isolated in this study drives high and constitutive expression in arabidopsis plants and displays great potential to be applied as biotechnological tool for the generation of gm crops, especially cotton. this sequence is particularly promising for those traits requiring high expression levels in root and flower tissues.
