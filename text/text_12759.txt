BACKGROUND
phaseolus vulgaris or common bean is the most important edible food legume in the world. it provides 15% of the protein and 30% of the caloric requirement to the world's population, and represents 50% of the grain legumes consumed worldwide  <cit> . common bean has several market classes, which include dry beans, canned beans, and green beans. the related legume soybean , which is one of the most important sources of seed protein and oil content belongs to the same group of papilionoid legumes as common bean. common bean and soybean diverged nearly  <dig> million years ago around the time of the major duplication event in soybean  <cit> . synteny analysis indicates that most segments of any one common bean linkage group are highly similar to two soybean chromosomes  <cit> . since p. vulgaris is a true diploid with a genome size estimated to be between  <dig> and  <dig> mega base pairs   <cit> , it will serve as a model for understanding the ~ <dig>  million base pairs  soybean genome  <cit> . common bean is also related to other members of the papilionid legumes including cowpea  and pigeon pea . therefore, better knowledge of the common bean genome will facilitate better understanding of other important legumes as well as the development of comparative genomics resources.

the common bean genome is currently being sequenced  <cit> . when the sequencing of the genome is complete, this will require the prediction, annotation and validation of the expressed genes in common bean. the availability of large sets of annotated sequences as derived by identification, sequencing, and validation of genes expressed in the common bean will help in the development of an accurate and complete structural annotation of the common bean genome, a valid transcriptome map, and the identification of the genetic basis of agriculturally important traits in common bean. the transcriptome sequences will also help in the identification of transcription factors and small rnas in common bean, understanding of gene families, and very importantly the development of molecular markers for common bean.

to date there are several relevant and important publications in common bean transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. ramirez et al.  <cit>  sequenced  <dig>  ests from various cdna libraries  derived from the meso-american common bean genotype negro jamapa  <dig>  and leaves from the andean genotype g <dig>  approximately  <dig>  of these identified ests were classified into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons.

melotto et al.  <cit>  constructed three cdna libraries from the common bean breeding line sel <dig>  these libraries were comprised of 19-day old trifoliate leaves, 10-day old shoots, and 13-day old shoots . of the  <dig>  single-pass sequences obtained from this work, trimming and clustering helped identify  <dig>  unigenes, and of these only  <dig> unigenes showed similarity to sequences from the existing database.

tian et al.  <cit>  constructed a suppression substractive cdna library to identify genes involved in response to phosphorous starvation. six-day old seedlings from the genotype g <dig> were exposed to high and low phosphorus  respectively and the poly  rna derived from total shoot and root rna from plants in these conditions was used for construction of the libraries. after dot-blot hybridization and identification of differentially expressed clones, full-length cdnas were identified from cdna libraries constructed from the low and high p exposure experiments. differentially expressed genes were characterized into five functional groups, and these authors were able to further classify  <dig> genes by comparison to the genbank non-redundant database using blastx values less than  <dig>  × 1e-2).

thibivilliers et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig>   <dig> new common bean ests  by using a substractive cdna library constructed from the common bean rust resistant-cultivar early gallatin. this cultivar was inoculated with races  <dig>  and  <dig> . in order to identify genes which are differentially expressed, suppression substractive expression experiments were carried out to identify sequences which were up-regulated in response to susceptible and resistant host-pathogen interactions.

despite these studies in common bean, there is still a paucity in the number of common bean ests and genes that have been deposited in genbank  compared to other legume and plant models. therefore, there is a need for deeper coverage and est sequences from diverse common bean tissues and genotypes.

there has been an evolution in sequencing technologies starting with the traditional dideoxynucleotide sequencing to capillary-based sequencing to current "next-generation" sequencing  <cit> . the emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies has substantially helped advance plant genome research, particularly for non-model plant species  <cit> . next generation sequencing strategies typically have the ability to generate millions of reads of sequences at a time, without the need for cloning of the fragment libraries; these are faster than traditional capillary-based methods which may be limited to  <dig> samples in a run and require the nucleic acid material  to be cloned into a plasmid and amplified by escherichia coli . therefore, cloning bias that is typically present in genome sequencing projects can be avoided, although depending on the specific platform used for next generation sequencing, there may be other specific biases involved. an advantage of some next generation sequencing technologies is that information on genome organization and layout may not be necessary a priori. the roche  <dig> method uses the pyrophosphate molecule released when nucleotides are incorporated by dna polymerase into the growing dna chain to fuel reactions that result in the detection of light resulting from cleavage of oxyluciferin by luciferase  <cit> . using an emulsion pcr approach, it has the ability to sequence  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides of paired ends and produces approximately 400- <dig> mbp per run. this method has been applied to genome  <cit>  and transcriptome  <cit>  sequencing due to its high throughput, coverage, and savings in cost.

in a. thaliana, pyrosequencing has been tested successfully to verify whether this technology is able to provide an unbiased representation of transcripts as compared to the sequenced genome. using messenger rna  derived from arabidopsis seedlings, weber and colleagues  <cit>  identified  <dig>  ests which accounted for nearly  <dig>  gene loci and thus provided very deep coverage of the transcriptome. the analysis also revealed that all regions of the mrna transcript were equally represented therefore removing issues of bias, and very importantly, over  <dig>  of the ests identified in this research were novel and did not exist in the existing est database. therefore, these researchers concluded that the pyrosequencing platform has the ability to aid in gene discovery and expression analysis for non-model plants, and could be used for both genomic and transcriptomic analysis.

in the legume medicago truncatula, the  <dig> technology has been used to generate  <dig>  reads with average  read length of  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> , with a total of  <dig>  unique sequences generated after clustering and assembly. gene ontology  assignments from matches to the completed arabidopsis sequence showed a broad coverage of the go categories. cheung and colleagues  <cit>  were also able to map  <dig>  reads generated in this research to  <dig> medicago bac sequences. in their analysis of the maize shoot apical meristem, emrich and colleagues  <cit>  discovered  <dig>  ests, annotated more than  <dig>  maize genomic sequences, and identified ~ <dig> maize transcripts for which homologs have not been identified in any other species. the value of this approach in novel gene/est discovery is underlined by the fact that nearly 30% of the ests identified in this study did not match the ~ <dig>  maize ests in the databases. velasco and colleagues  <cit>  generated a draft genome of grape, vitis vinifera pinot noir by using a combination of sanger sequencing and  <dig> sequencing. they identified approximately  <dig>  predicted genes of which  <dig> % could be assigned to genetic linkage groups . many of the genes identified have potential implications on grapevine cultivation including those that influence wine quality, and response to pathogens. detailed analysis was also carried out to identify sequences related to disease resistance, phenolic and terpenoid pathways, transcription factors, repetitive elements, and non-coding rnas .

sequences obtained in common bean by deep sequencing can be mapped onto common bean maps by using syntenic relationships between common bean and soybean; these two species diverged over  <dig> mya. mcclean et al.  <cit>  determined syntenic relationships between common bean and soybean by taking genetically positioned transcript loci and mapping to the soybean  <dig>  pseudochromosome assembly. since prior evidence has shown that almost every common bean locus maps to two soybean locations , and a genome assembly is not yet available in common bean, this synteny can be effectively utilized. therefore, by referencing common bean loci with unknown physical map positions  to syntenic regions in soybean, and then referencing back to the common bean genetic map, approximate locations of common bean transcript loci were determined. using this method, the authors  <cit>  were able to determine median physical-to-genetic distance ratio in common bean to be ~ <dig> kb/cm . this allowed the placing of ~ <dig>  est contigs and singletons on the common bean map, and this strategy will allow for the discovery and chromosomal locations of genes controlling important traits in both common bean and soybean. therefore, until the common bean genome is completed, we can now use synteny with soybean to determine more accurate locations of common bean transcripts.

RESULTS
generation of ests from phaseolus vulgaris
since the combined total number of common bean ests that have been deposited in genbank  is ~ <dig> , we sought to increase the diversity and number of these sequences to be useful for functional genomics and molecular breeding studies. we generated cdna libraries from four plant tissues: leaves, flowers, roots derived from the common bean cultivar "sierra", and pods derived from the common bean breeding line "bat <dig> " even though the genotype that was chosen for the common bean genome sequencing project is g <dig>  there is considerable value in generating transcriptomic sequences from these additional genotypes. sierra is a common bean cultivar released by michigan state university with improved disease resistance, competitive yield, and upright growth habit. additionally, disease resistance in sierra includes rust resistance, field tolerance to white mold, and resistance to fusarium wilt  <cit> . the breeding line bat <dig> is one of the parents of the core common bean mapping populations, and therefore, understanding and identification of sequences expressed in the developing pod is very useful. bat <dig> also carries resistances to multiple diseases. the sequence data obtained from this work will also be very useful in identifying single nucleotide polymorphism  loci when compared to sequences derived from other genotypes in the work by ramirez et al.  <cit> , melotto et al.  <cit>  and thibivilliers et al.  <cit> .

the use of next-generation sequencing for transcriptome and genome studies has been well documented . given the paucity of available common bean sequences and our interest in generating sequence reads long enough to be useful for the design of primers for mapping onto the common bean map, we chose the roche  <dig> sequencing method . cdnas derived from the rna of the four tissues were tagged with sequence tags that would help identify tissue of origin after sequencing and assembly of data. after normalization, library construction and sequencing, sequences were assembled and annotated  resulting in the generation of ~ <dig>  million reads, with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides  and a total length of  <dig> mbp derived from three bulk  <dig> runs. these reads were assembled using gsassembler , into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. of these singletons,  <dig>  were determined to be less than  <dig> nucleotides . therefore, sequences derived from this study serve as an important first step to deriving a larger transcriptomic set of sequences in common bean and additionally demonstrate the value of next-generation sequencing. further, these common bean sequences will be important for discovery of orthologous genes in other so-called "orphan legumes"  <cit> . assembly statistics for the  <dig> reads are shown in table  <dig>  of the  <dig>  million reads, we were able to assemble 75% of the reads. the average length of contigs was  <dig> nt and for singletons  <dig> nt . for the purposes of this work, we consider the  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons which are longer than  <dig> nt collectively as unigenes . the number of contigs and singletons with respective sizes are shown in table  <dig>  the largest number of contigs  was in the 200- <dig> nt range, followed by  <dig>  contigs in the 100- <dig> nt range. there were  <dig>  contigs which were >  <dig>  nt. the longest contig length was  <dig>  nt.

in order to determine the number of reads which make up any particular contig in the assembly, we determined the number of reads versus number of contigs . in our unigenes sequences,  <dig>  contigs were comprised of 2- <dig> reads .

comparative analysis with existing phaseolus vulgaris ests
most of the common bean ests available in genbank are derived from genotypes such as early gallatin, bat  <dig>  negro jamapa  <dig>  and g <dig>  <cit> . in order to identify new p. vulgaris sequences among the  <dig> unigene set that we generated, a blastn search  against the common bean ests in genbank was carried out and revealed that  <dig>   of the  <dig> unigenes matched known ests. thus  <dig>  unigenes  can be considered as new p. vulgaris unigenes.

the  <dig>  common bean est sequences  can be assembled into about  <dig>  unique sequences. these new sequences significantly enrich by approximately 150% the number of transcripts of this important legume and provide a significant resource for discovering new genes, developing molecular markers for future genetic linkage and qtl analysis, and comparative studies with other legumes, and will help in the discovery and understanding of genes underlying agriculturally important traits in common bean.

comparison with common bean bac-end sequences
recently, a bac library for common bean genotype g <dig> was constructed  <cit> , and a draft fingerprinted contig  physical map has been released using the bac-end sequences from this work . this data set contains  <dig>  bac-end sequences. the fpc physical map makes it possible to map some  <dig> unigenes into the bean physical map. all the  <dig> unigenes were compared to the bac-end sequences by blastn  according to mcclean et al  <cit> . as a result, a total of  <dig>  unigenes including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons , were mapped to the available  <dig>  bac-end sequences.

functional annotation of the p. vulgaris unigenes-comparison to arabidopsis
the common bean unigene set was compared to predicted arabidopsis protein sequences by using blastx. a total of  <dig>   of the unigenes had a significant match with the annotated arabidopsis proteins, and were assigned putative functions . however,  <dig> %  of the common bean unigenes had no significant match and therefore could not be classified into gene ontology  categories. the comparison of the distribution of p. vulgaris unigenes among go molecular function groups with that of a. thaliana suggests that this  <dig> unigene set is broadly representative of the p. vulgaris transcriptome. unigenes with positive matches to the arabidopsis proteins were grouped into  <dig> categories . the largest proportion of the functionally assigned unigenes fell into seven categories: unknown , nucleotide metabolism , protein metabolism , plant development and senescence , stress defense , signal transduction  and transport .

functional comparison to soybean
all of the common bean unigenes were used to compare with soybean peptide sequences  by blastx . as a result, a total of  <dig> %  unigenes have a good match to soybean peptide sequences. therefore the number of common bean matches to soybean sequences was significantly higher  compared to arabidopsis and may reflect the larger number of predicted genes in soybean compared to arabidopsis. these sequences can be used for discovery of not only common bean genes but also for validation of predicted soybean genes.

comparison of p. vulgaris unigenes with those in m. truncatula, g. max, l japonicus, a. thaliana and o. sativa
we were also interested in understanding the relationship of common bean unigenes in this study to those that have been identified in other legume models and the model plants arabidopsis and rice with larger sequence collections. we also wanted to determine the unique and shared sequences between common bean, medicago, lotus and soybean, and also those that are shared between common bean, arabidopsis and rice. nearly 54%  of the common bean unigenes have homology to medicago, 44%  have homology to lotus, and 63%  have homology to soybean . approximately 72%  of common bean unigenes are shared between the four legume species . we also determined that 54%  of the common bean unigenes are shared with arabidopsis and 99%  are shared with rice. when compared to medicago, soybean and lotus, 28%  of the unigenes are unique to common bean whereas only  <dig> %  of the unigenes are unique to common bean when compared to arabidopsis and rice .

as seen in the comparison to the arabidopsis transcriptome, the most abundant category was comprised of  <dig> % of the unigenes with unknown functions which was consistent with the previous study by thibivilliers et al.  <cit> , who found that  <dig> % of common bean ests from bean rust-infected plants had an unknown function. they also found that  <dig> % of those ests fell into signal transduction and nucleotide metabolism classes. similarly, our results found that  <dig> % of  <dig> unigenes belonged to signal transduction and nucleotide metabolism. additionally, this analysis showed that  <dig> % of the unigenes belong to the stress defense category. these unigenes provide a new and additional source for mining stress-regulated and defense response genes. interestingly, wong et al.  <cit>  identified a common bean antimicrobial peptide with the ability to inhibit the human immunodeficiency virus - <dig> reverse transcriptase. this 47-amino acid peptide was also found to inhibit fungi such as botrytis cinerea, fusarium oxysporum and mycosphaerella arachidicola. we used the corresponding nucleotide sequence from this peptide to search against the  <dig> sequences in this report, and discovered one unigene represented by contig <dig> with a nucleotide length of  <dig> bases. search of this sequence against the ncbi non-redundant database identified homology to a plant defensin peptide from legumes such as mung bean, soybean, medicago, and yam-bean , and it is possible that this is a gene that is specific to legumes.

validation of common bean reference genes
thibivilliers et al.  <cit>  compared several housekeeping genes for use as a common bean reference for qrt-pcr experiments. they tested three bean genes tc <dig> , tc <dig> , and tc <dig> , and the common bean homologs of the soybean genes cons <dig> , cons <dig> , and cons <dig> . these researchers concluded that cons <dig> was the most stably expressed for their experimental conditions. likewise, libault et al.  <cit>  also identified cons <dig> to be stably expressed and to be useful as a reference gene for quantitative studies in soybean, and with the confirmation in our studies can possibly be used for other legume gene expression experiments. therefore, for our experiments, we used the gmcons <dig> primers and verified expression in the sierra genotype ; this was then used as an endogenous control, and used in leaf tissue as a reference gene for expression analysis of common bean contigs.

quantification of tissue-specific expression of the common bean transcriptome
when the cdna libraries were created, the four tissues were tagged using a molecular barcode, based on their source of either leaves, roots, flowers or pods  so that we could determine possible origin of tissues of the transcripts. the tags can be used to describe the presence or degree of tissue-specific expression of the unigenes. the distribution of these tags among the four tissues is shown in figure  <dig>  about 69%  of the unigenes were present in leaves, 52%  were present in flowers, 42%  were present in roots, and 36%  were present in pods. among all the unigenes, 27%  were observed only in leaves, 8%  only in roots, 11%  only in flowers, and 6%  only in pods.

in our analysis of the  <dig> data, we found that  <dig>  contigs were composed of transcripts that were derived from multiple tissues . the tagging of the cdna libraries will be very useful in order to verify and validate global gene expression patterns and understanding both shared and unique transcripts between and among the tissues in this study. equally significant is the ability to capture rarely expressed transcripts. since normalization was carried out , the large number of transcripts derived from leaves is interesting. the contigs and singletons which contain flower, root, and pod-specific transcripts will be very useful to understand and compare with transcriptomic sequences derived from other temporal and spatial conditions from other studies.

ssr analysis
simple sequence repeats , or microsatellites consist of repeats of short nucleotide motifs with two to six base pairs in length. in the present study, the  <dig>  454-derived sequences from common bean  and  <dig>  common bean genomic sequences  were analyzed for ssr sequences using the software misa http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa. we surveyed these and all other sequences mentioned in this analysis for di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide type of ssrs. we detected a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ssrs in 454-derived and genomic sequences respectively . in order to determine the identification of ssr sequences from other plants with both transcriptome and genomic resources, we analyzed  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig>  mbp of genomic sequences from g. max,  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig>  mbp of genomic sequences from m. truncatula, and  <dig>  unigenes and the whole genome from arabidopsis. in g. max, we found  <dig>  ssrs in the unigenes, and  <dig>  ssrs in genomic sequences. in m. truncatula, we found  <dig>  ssrs in the unigenes, and  <dig>  ssrs in the genomic sequences, and finally we found  <dig>  ssrs in arabidopsis unigenes, and  <dig>  ssrs in arabidopsis genomic sequences .

we then analyzed the average distance between any two ssrs and found that this differed among species. the average distance between two ssrs in unigenes and genomic sequences of p. vulgaris was  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb respectively, higher than that of the other three species. however, the average distance between two ssrs was quite similar between unigenes and genomic sequences for common bean, soybean, medicago, and lotus .

the frequency of ssrs in terms of repeat motif length  was different. of all the ssrs found in common bean unigenes, dinucleotide, trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide and hexanucleotide repeats account for  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, while repeats account for  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in genomic sequences. in g. max unigenes, dinucleotide, trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide and hexanucleotide repeats account for  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, and was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in genomic sequences. in m. truncatula unigenes, dinucleotide, trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide and hexanucleotide repeats account for  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, and was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in genomic sequences. in arabidopsis unigenes, dinucleotide, trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide and hexanucleotide repeats account for  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, which was different from  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in genomic sequences. the most frequent type of repeat motif between unigenes and genomic sequences was different. trinucleotide ssrs were the most common type in unigenes in all the four species, while dinucleotide ssrs were the most common type in genomic sequences. these est-ssrs will help to develop ssr markers with high polymorphism for common bean.

tri-nucleotides were found to be the most abundant repeats and aag/ctt repeats were the most frequent motifs in the tri-nucleotides. the prevalence of tri-nucleotide over di-nucleotide or other ssrs was also observed in the unigenes of g. max, m. truncatula and a. thaliana, and also may be characteristic of est-ssrs of maize, wheat, rice, sorghum, barley  <cit>  and many other plant species  <cit> . in contrast, di-nucleotides were the most common repeats in the genomic sequences of the four species and at/at was the most dominant repeat. blair et al.  <cit>  and cordoba et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> gene-based ssrs and  <dig> ssrs from common bean ests and bac-end sequences, respectively. they also found that tri-nucleotide ssrs were more common in ests, while di-nucleotide ssrs were more dominant in gsss. the frequency of ssr-containing ests in the common bean unigenes as shown in this study was  <dig> % and much lower than that of rice  <cit> , bread wheat  <cit> , and other plants  <cit> . the ssrs identified in the present study can be used by the common bean community as molecular markers for mapping of important agronomic traits and for integration of common bean genetic and physical maps.

validation of selected bean  <dig> transcripts
we wanted to verify the expression of common bean ests identified in this work, before which we ensured that the procedures that we were following in the laboratory were consistent and that there was no contamination of the cdna with genomic dna. figures 6a and 6b show that the cdna that we have used for our gene expression experiments is contamination free. we wanted to test the accuracy of the contigs assembled by the gsassembler with reverse transcriptase -pcr. we designed pcr primers for  <dig> randomly selected contigs  and analyzed the cdna under standard pcr conditions and electrophoresed the products on a 2% agarose gel .

almost all of the amplifications yielded single products ranging from  <dig> bp- <dig> bp showing that these are real transcripts derived from mrna.

quantitative pcr analysis of  <dig> common bean contigs
of the  <dig> contigs whose amplification is shown in figure  <dig>  we randomly chose  <dig> contigs  for further analysis with quantitative pcr. randomly selected contigs were tested to determine if they were derived from rna sequences and for their expression pattern in common bean plant parts under ambient conditions. relative quantification of contig expression was performed by comparative ΔΔct analysis from leaf, flower, pod and root tissues using leaf as a reference sample.

* data not available 

almost all of the contigs showed expression as illustrated in table  <dig>  we highlight a few contigs here including contig <dig> , contig <dig> , contig <dig>  and contig <dig>  for which the expression levels were lower in flowers, pods and roots compared to leaves. contig <dig> , contig <dig> , contig <dig> , and contig <dig>  showed higher expression levels in flower, pod and roots compared to leaves. expression levels of contig <dig> with homology to a wrky- <dig> transcription factor involved in bacterial wilt resistance  <cit>  and contig <dig> with homology to another wrky <dig> transcription factor were high  in pods compared to leaves. expression levels of contig <dig> , contig <dig>  and contig <dig>  were higher  in flower than leaf, pods, and roots. interestingly pcr primers designed from contig <dig> showed a size difference when amplified from genomic and cdna, and it is possible that the primers were designed from a region flanking an intron .

identification of transcription factors
putative common bean transcription factors  were identified by comparing arabidopsis transcription factors http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v <dig> / against the  <dig> sequencing-derived unigenes in this study  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  unigenes coding for putative transcription factors were identified in common bean, which is similar to the  <dig>  transcription factors discovered in arabidopsis. however, these numbers represent about half of the transcription factors  discovered in soybean. in table  <dig> we show the  <dig> most common transcription factor families found in common bean and corresponding tfs identified from arabidopsis  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> .

the largest share of common bean transcription factors  shows homology to the myb super family similar to soybean  and arabidopsis thaliana  which show the same abundance. this high number of myb transcription factor identification may be due to their abundance in the genome as well as identification and characterization in model organisms. myb genes are involved in regulation of various metabolic pathways and developmental regulation by determining cell fate and identity  <cit> . study of these genes in common bean will help in the identification and analysis of important developmental pathways.

the second largest tf family in common bean  has similarity with the  family as compared to  <dig> in soybean and  <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana as shown in table  <dig>  the nac gene family is reported to be composed of plant-specific transcription factors with a broad role in plant development  and response to external stimuli  <cit> . several nac genes were induced by cold and dehydration in brassica napus  <cit> , by abscisic acid  and salt stress in rice  <cit> , drought and developmental processes in chickpea  <cit> , salinity and osmotic stress  <cit>  and stripe rust in wheat  <cit> .

we found  <dig> set,  <dig> mterf,  <dig> snf <dig> and  <dig> far <dig> unigenes in our study from common bean. there are  <dig> set,  <dig> mterf,  <dig> snf <dig> and  <dig> far <dig> transcription factors from arabidopsis which are not represented in the soybean and medicago transcription factor databases http://bioinfo <dig> noble.org/dmtr/ to date. the set tf family is involved in methylation of lysine residues on histone tails. as of now the set family has been found only in a few species http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v <dig> /. it is important to reveal the structural and functional details of these transcription factors as studies on epigenetics are expanding  <cit> . the snf <dig> family of proteins which are dna-dependent atpases play an important role in chromatin remodelling complexes that are involved in epigenetic gene regulation. the mterf family contains leucine zipper-like heptads that may be involved in mtdna transcription and replication  <cit>  while the far <dig> family is involved in regulation of the circadian clock in arabidopsis  <cit> .

identification and analysis of nodulation-specific contigs in the unigene dataset
the  <dig> soybean nodulation genes discovered by schmutz et al.  <cit>  were compared to the common bean unigenes, using the tblastn algorithm. we considered as orthologs, hits with an e-value of <  <dig> × 10- <dig> as per mcclean et al. . a total of  <dig> hits were identified and the average e-value for these hits was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . sixteen unigenes are seen to be expressed more abundantly in root tissues and this gene family will be investigated in further detail in subsequent studies.

CONCLUSIONS
genomic resources in legume crops are lacking with the exception of soybean and medicago for which whole-genome sequences are now available. since the common bean genome is relatively small compared to other legumes, there is a great potential to utilize and apply the information from common bean to other legume crops such as soybean, cowpea, mung bean, rice bean and lentils. we have partially made up for this lack of genomic information by sequencing a large number of cdnas. in summary, we identified  <dig>  common bean unigenes of which  <dig>  unigenes are newly discovered sequences. combined with existing transcriptomic and genomic sequences available for common bean, this dataset will be very useful for functional genomics research in common bean.

comparison of the number of common bean unigene matches to other legumes shows that there may be many more legume unigenes that are yet to be discovered. therefore, high throughput transcriptome sequencing will continue to help in identifying genes associated with biotic and abiotic stress, development of high resolution genetic maps, and automated phenotyping which will lead to crop improvement.
