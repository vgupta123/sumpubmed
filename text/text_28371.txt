BACKGROUND
alfalfa  is the most widely cultivated forage legume in the world  <cit>  and the fourth most widely grown crop in the united states  <cit> . in  <dig>  over  <dig> million metric tons of alfalfa dry hay with a value of over $ <dig> billion were harvested from over  <dig>  million hectares in the us  <cit> . in addition to being a valuable forage crop for livestock, alfalfa has considerable potential as a sustainable, cellulosic feedstock for ethanol production  <cit> . alfalfa is a relatively high biomass crop that also provides environmental benefits  <cit> . for example, alfalfa improves soil and water quality, promotes wildlife diversity and provides its own nitrogen fertilizer through symbiotic nitrogen fixation  <cit> .

a promising strategy for developing alfalfa as a cellulosic ethanol crop involves separating leaves and stems following harvest  <cit> . the leaves would be used as a protein supplement for livestock while the stems would be used to produce ethanol. our research has focused on selecting for large stem, non-lodging, biomass-type alfalfa germplasm and developing management strategies to optimize biomass yield. to date, these efforts have resulted in a 40% increase in total biomass and a doubling of theoretical ethanol yield  <cit> . we have also initiated research to modify the composition of alfalfa stem cell walls via a transgenic approach. the efficiency of ethanol production from cellulosic biomass is positively correlated with cellulose content but negatively correlated with lignin content  <cit> . thus, the value of alfalfa as a cellulosic feedstock would be enhanced by developing new alfalfa varieties that have increased cellulose and decreased lignin in stem cell walls  <cit> . to facilitate the identification of key genes regulating cell wall composition, we selected alfalfa germplasm  that exhibit significant differences in lignin and cellulose concentrations in stem cell walls  <cit> . on a dry matter basis, stem cellulose and klason lignin concentrations of plants at flowering are significantly higher in genotype  <dig> compared to genotype  <dig> .

a high-density oligonucleotide microarray is not yet available for global transcript profiling in alfalfa. however, the genechip® medicago genome array is available. this genechip contains a total of  <dig>  medicago probe sets designed from  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences from m. truncatula and alfalfa, respectively. each probe set in the genechip consists of  <dig> perfect match  and  <dig> mismatch  25-mer probes. an underlying assumption when using microarrays for cross-species hybridization  is that the level of sequence homology among genes of closely-related species is significant enough to enable detection by probes originally designed for their orthologs. previous research indicated that the medicago genechip® is a suitable cross-species platform for transcript profiling in alfalfa  <cit> . in large part, this is because there is a significant level of gene homology. for example, a previous study reported that dna sequence identity was 93% or greater between protein coding regions of selected homologous genes in alfalfa and m. truncatula  <cit> . however, in previous research using the medicago genechip® for transcript profiling in alfalfa tissues, we observed decreased sensitivity  and decreased accuracy in measuring fold-changes in gene expression compared to results obtained with m. truncatula tissues  <cit> .

numerous studies, conducted with both animals and plants, have reported transcript profiling involving csh to dna microarrays of a closely-related species  <cit> . in a number of these studies, electronic masking was used to remove biased probes prior to microarray data analysis. for example, ranz et al.  <cit>  introduced a probe selection method based on genomic dna hybridizations of the target and non-target species to the genechip. this approach has been used for csh studies involving plant species  <cit> . however, a recent csh study involving xenopus species questioned the reliability of this method for selecting unbiased probes  <cit> . transcript profiling in non-human primates using the human genechip for csh was optimized by identifying inter-species conserved probe sets  <cit> . these probe sets were identified by aligning expressed sequence tags  in non-human primate with probe sequences on the affymetrix human genechip® platform. however, this approach is not feasible for species with limited sequence information such as alfalfa. in a study using the human genechip as a cross-species platform to measure gene expression in heart and liver tissues of non-human mammals , ji et al.  <cit>  developed a protocol to selectively mask poorly hybridized probes using the match/mismatch feature of the genechip. to evaluate whether masking improved the accuracy of measuring gene expression, it was hypothesized that different organs  of humans and non-human mammals have similar gene expression patterns. after masking low intensity probes in the microarray data of the cross-species, ji et al.  <cit>  found a linear correlation  for ln values between human and mouse genechip data. these authors concluded that comparisons of gene expression patterns in defined tissues of related species could be used to optimize csh studies involving other mammals or plants.

in earlier research, we examined gene expression at two stages of stem development for alfalfa and medicago truncatula  <cit> . in both species, transcript profiling was conducted in elongating stem internodes  and post-elongation stem internodes . genes associated with primary cell wall development were preferentially expressed in es internodes while genes associated with secondary xylem development were enriched in pes internodes. the objective of this study was to identify genes that are differentially expressed in es and pes internodes of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> using the genechip® medicago genome array as a cross-species platform. to optimize cross-species hybridization analysis, we developed a protocol for masking probes targeting inter-species variable  regions. after masking for isv regions and single-feature polymorphisms  previously detected in genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , we identified numerous genes that were differentially expressed in es and pes internodes of the two genotypes.

RESULTS
masking probes targeting inter-species variable regions
as a preliminary analysis of sequence divergence between orthologous genes of medicago truncatula and medicago sativa , we blasted  <dig>  m. truncatula probe sequences  on the genechip® medicago genome array against the  <dig>  alfalfa expressed sequence tag  sequences that are currently available from the public database . a total of  <dig>  m. truncatula probe sequences had alfalfa est hits and  <dig>  of them  showed at least one base mismatch . these results suggested that masking isv regions would optimize transcript profiling when using the medicago genechip® as a cross-species platform for measuring gene expression in alfalfa.

we developed a protocol to mask probes targeting isv regions of the probe sets expressed in es and pes internodes of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  a work-flow diagram of the protocol used to mask probes targeting isv regions is shown in figure  <dig>  for each tissue sample, three biological replicates were collected producing a total of  <dig> data points per probe . a series of hybridization signal intensity thresholds were used to mask probes with signals below the threshold . for a particular probe , all data points were kept if three or more probes were above the signal intensity threshold. otherwise, all  <dig> probes were masked.

the gene  expression levels were derived from the signal intensities of the retained probes in each probe set by using robust multi-array average  which involves background corrections, multi-chip quantile normalization and multi-chip summarization processes  <cit> . as expected, the number of probes retained decreased rapidly  while the number of probe sets retained decreased gradually  as signal intensity threshold increased .

in previous work, we used the medicago genechip to compare gene expression in es versus pes internodes of m. truncatula genotype a <dig> from which most of the probes on the genechip were designed  <cit> . the masking protocol developed in this study is based on the assumption that the ratio of expression of genes in es and pes internodes  of alfalfa is very similar to that measured in these tissues in m. truncatula . using the m. truncatula dataset, we identified genes  that exhibited at least a 2-fold difference in gene expression between es and pes tissues. next, we identified genes that exhibited at least a 2-fold difference in expression ratio between es and pes internodes of alfalfa genotype  <dig> as probe signal intensity threshold was increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  genes exhibiting at least a 2-fold difference in expression ratio between es and pes internodes of both alfalfa and m. truncatula are referred to as commonly-selected genes. the number of commonly-selected genes increased from ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig>  as the signal intensity threshold increased to a value of  <dig> reflecting increased detection sensitivity . the effect of masking biased probes with low signal intensity on the condensed signal intensity of the corresponding probe set is shown in figure  <dig>  boxplots of the twelve genechip datasets  for alfalfa before and after masking isv regions  show that masking increased mean signal intensity of the genechip dataset by approximately four-fold. the mean signal intensity after masking isv regions is very close to the mean signal intensity of genechip dataset for stem internodes of m. truncatula . overall, masking isv regions increased the signal intensity of the medicago probe sets which in turn increased the sensitivity of detecting alfalfa gene expression on the medicago genechip.


to evaluate the effect of masking for isv regions on the accuracy of measuring fold-changes in gene expression between pes and es internodes of alfalfa, we examined the correlation of the hybridization intensity signal ratio of pes and es internodes for the commonly-selected genes from the two medicago species as signal intensity threshold was increased. the pearson correlation coefficient of the pes/es ratio between m. truncatula and alfalfa increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  as signal intensity threshold increased up to about  <dig> reflecting increased accuracy . the decline in correlation detected at signal intensity thresholds above  <dig> may be due to masking too many informative probes. although the highest correlation of the pes/es ratio between the two medicago species was achieved with a signal intensity threshold of  <dig>  the number of commonly-selected genes was reduced . the data in figure  <dig> show that the effect of masking on accuracy and sensitivity intersect at a signal intensity threshold of  <dig> where over  <dig>  probe sets  were retained . on the basis of these results, we used a signal intensity threshold of  <dig> for masking biased probes due to isv regions. the use of this masking threshold significantly improved sensitivity  while maintaining a high level of accuracy in measuring fold-difference in gene expression.

most csh studies in plants have used a genomic dna-based strategy for probe selection  <cit> . to our knowledge, this study is the first to employ an rna-based probe selection protocol to mask isv regions when using a cross-species platform for transcript profiling in plants. the masking protocol that we developed has some advantages over previously reported masking protocols especially for crops with limited sequence information. for example, neither dna hybridization  <cit>  nor prerequisite sequence information  <cit>  is needed to identify inter-species conserved probe sets. in addition, with careful experimental design including adequate replication, the masking protocol developed in this study is relatively simple to implement . the protocol is based on the assumption that the ratio of gene expression in pes and es internodes of two closely-related medicago species  is similar. in mammals, a similar approach involving comparisons of gene expression between organs has been used successfully in csh studies  <cit> . in our study, the ratio of expression of probe sets in es and pes internodes of m. truncatula was used to optimize both the sensitivity and the accuracy of detecting genes differentially expressed in alfalfa stem internodes. our results suggest that a similar rna-based approach for masking isv regions could be successfully applied to other closely-related plant species where a microarray platform is available for one species.

although the masking protocol used in this study is a useful tool for optimizing csh genechip date, it does not correct for all bias in the data. it is important that candidate genes selected for further study based on masking results be validated by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. in addition, one limitation of a masking protocol based on rna hybridization intensity is bias toward abundant transcripts. low abundance genes  would most likely be masked using this protocol.

masking probes for both isv regions and sfps
single-feature polymorphisms  are polymorphisms detected by single probes in microarrays  <cit> . previously, we identified  <dig>  sfps between alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> using the genechip expression data files for es and pes internodes  <cit> . these allelic variations between the two genotypes can bias transcript profiling by causing both false positives and false negatives  <cit> . the effect of masking for both isv regions and sfps  on the number of probe sets retained was minimal. only about  <dig> additional probe sets were lost after further masking for sfps . by masking for probes targeting both inter- and intra-species variable regions, we improved the quality of the csh genechip data for the two alfalfa genotypes examined. the double-masking strategy employed in this study can be applied to other species when using a cross-species platform for transcript profiling between two genotypes.

effect of masking on detection of differentially expressed genes
we used a t-test  combined with an additional cut-off ratio of 2-fold to identify genes that were differentially expressed in es and pes internodes of genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> . the venn diagrams in figure  <dig> show the number of differentially expressed genes identified before masking, after masking for isv regions, and after double-masking . masking for isv regions using a signal intensity threshold of  <dig> increased the number of differentially-expressed genes identified in es and pes internodes by about  <dig> -fold. after double-masking, the number of differentially expressed genes detected was decreased compared to the number detected after masking for isv regions only . this decrease is probably due to removal of probes associated with sfps that were responsible for generating false positives for differentially expressed genes. after double-masking,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between the two alfalfa genotypes in es and pes internodes, respectively . a total of  <dig> genes were detected in both es and pes internodes. from these results, we can estimate the number of putative false positives and false negatives that might have been caused by sequence variation . for example in figure 5a,  <dig> genes identified as being differentially expressed prior to masking, but not included after double-masking may be putative false positives caused by isv regions and/or sfps;  <dig> genes selected after masking for isv regions but not included after double-masking may be putative false positives caused by sfps; and  <dig> differentially expressed genes detected only after double-masking may be putative false negatives caused by isv regions and/or sfps .

differences in gene expression between stem internodes of genotypes  <dig> and 1283
genes that were differentially expressed in the internodes of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> after double-masking were functionally classified using the mapman gene functional classification system  <cit>  . to obtain an overview of gene functional classes that were differentially expressed in the two alfalfa genotypes, we conducted over-representation analysis using pageman, a software tool for comparative analysis of gene ontology  <cit>  . compared to all probe sets on the medicago genechip, "regulation of transcription" and "signalling" classes were significantly over-represented among genes up-regulated in pes internodes of genotype  <dig> compared to genotype  <dig> .

the transcript profiles of regulatory genes that were differentially expressed in es and pes internodes of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are visually displayed in figures 7a and 7b, respectively. a total of  <dig> putative transcription factor and  <dig> receptor kinase genes were differentially regulated between stems of the two alfalfa genotypes. the number of regulatory genes that were differentially expressed between the two genotypes was greater in pes internodes compared to es internodes. the majority of putative transcription factor and receptor kinase genes that were up-regulated in pes internodes were found in genotype  <dig> .

the role of various transcription factors in regulating cell wall development has been examined primarily in arabidopsis and poplar   <cit> . for example, over-expression of some nac  and myb proteins in arabidopsis led to abnormal ectopic deposition of secondary cell walls and suppression of their functions resulted in a decrease in secondary cell wall thickening  <cit> . some myb family transcription factors also regulate the expression of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . interestingly, a recent study suggested that the nac family transcription factor snd <dig>  acts as a master transcriptional switch for activating secondary cell wall biosynthetic pathways by regulating the expression of  <dig> transcription factors  essential for normal secondary cell wall development  <cit> . in the alfalfa genotypes examined in this study, putative nac genes mtr. <dig> .s1_at and mtr. <dig> .s1_at were up-regulated in both es and pes internodes of genotype  <dig> compared to the same tissues in genotype  <dig>  three myb genes  were up-regulated in  <dig> pes internodes compared to  <dig> pes internodes. among these, mtr. <dig> .s1_at is a putative homolog of atmyb <dig> , a snd- <dig> regulated myb transcription factor that specifically activates lignin biosynthetic genes during secondary cell wall formation in arabidopsis  <cit> . atmyb <dig> was specifically expressed in fibers and vessels undergoing secondary cell wall thickening. over-expression of atmyb <dig> resulted in specific activation of lignin biosynthetic genes causing ectopic deposition of lignin in normally non-lignifying cells. suppression of atmyb <dig> led to a reduction in secondary cell wall thickening and lignin content  <cit> . mtr. <dig> .s1_at also has high sequence homology with two other snd1-regulated atmyb genes  with 73% and 70% identity at the protein level, respectively. over-expression of atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> led to an increase in secondary cell wall thickening in fibers and ectopic deposition of lignin in epidermal and cortical cells in stems  <cit> . dominant repression of atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> resulted in significantly reduced secondary cell wall thickening in fiber cells. we also identified numerous other differentially expressed transcription factor families that have not been previously reported to play a role in cell wall development. for example, zinc finger  and wrky  were the most abundant families among the differentially expressed transcription factors in genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  other significant transcription factor families identified include bhlh, b-zip, and ap2/erebp .

receptor-like kinases  were also significantly over-represented among genes up-regulated in genotype  <dig> pes internodes compared to genotype  <dig> pes internodes . rlks are known to play significant roles in plant growth, development and defence responses  <cit> . there are more than  <dig> rlks in the arabidopsis genome. several recent reports suggested a significant role for rlks in regulating cell wall development. for example, a loss of function mutant of theseus <dig>  a plasma membrane receptor kinase, suppressed the ectopic lignification and growth inhibition phenotype of prc1- <dig>  a recessive cellulose synthase  <dig> arabidopsis mutant, by repressing the induction of stress responses. these results suggested that the theseus <dig> rlk acts as sensor of cell wall integrity  <cit> . mutations in two leucine-rich repeat  rlks  disrupt anisotropic expansion and the synthesis of cell wall polymers including cellulose biosynthesis  <cit> . waks  are tightly bound to the cell wall and are thought to play a significant role in regulating cell wall function as well  <cit> . among the  <dig> putative rlks identified in genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> were up-regulated in  <dig> pes internodes, one was up-regulated in both es and pes internodes of  <dig>  and one was up-regulated in  <dig> es internodes compared to  <dig> es or pes internodes. one of the rlks up-regulated in  <dig> pes internodes  is a homolog of arabidopsis fei <dig>  two putative waks  were up-regulated in  <dig> pes internodes as well.

mapman  <cit>  was also used to provide an overview of metabolism genes that were differentially expressed in es and pes internodes of genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  examples of metabolism-related genes that are differentially expressed between genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> in es and pes internodes are shown in figures 8a and 8b . a number of cell wall-related genes were differentially expressed in the two genotypes with the greatest number detected in pes internodes. for example, seven putative cellulose synthase  or cesa-like genes were differentially regulated between the two alfalfa genotypes. six of these putative cesa or cesa-like genes  were up-regulated in  <dig> pes internodes compared to  <dig> pes internodes. only one cesa gene  was up-regulated in genotype  <dig> es internodes compared to genotype  <dig> es internodes. in arabidopsis, three cesa genes  are known to be involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . mtr. <dig> .s1_at and mtr. <dig> .s1_at probe sets are putative homologs of cesa <dig>  mtr. <dig> .s1_s_at and mtr. <dig> .s1_at are putative homologs of cesa <dig> and cesa <dig>  respectively. mtr. <dig> .s1_at and mtr. <dig> .s1_at are the putative homologs of arabidopsis csld <dig>  and csld <dig>  csdls are thought to be involved in the synthesis of xylan, non-crystalline cellulose, and the galactan side chains of pectin or arabinogalactan proteins  <cit> . other interesting cell wall genes that were up-regulated in genotype  <dig> pes internodes include udp-glucose 6-dehydrogenase  and sucrose synthase . both genes are involved in the metabolism of udp-d-glucose, a precursor for the synthesis of cellulose and cell wall matrix polysaccharides.

we also identified differentially expressed genes involved in lignin biosynthesis in the stems of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> . for example, hydroxycinnamoyltransferase  and caffeoyl-coa 3-o-methyltransferase  were up-regulated in both es and pes internodes of genotype  <dig> compared to  <dig>  however, the degree of up-regulation in  <dig> was greater in pes internodes compared to es internodes. in addition, three putative laccase genes  and a putative 4-coumarate-coa ligase gene  were up-regulated in genotype  <dig> pes compared to genotype  <dig>  interestingly, some genes involved in lignin biosynthesis were down-regulated in genotype  <dig> compared to genotype  <dig>  for example, two putative ccoaomt genes  and cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase  were down-regulated in genotype  <dig> compared to genotype  <dig> 

differences in gene expression between stem internodes of genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are consistent with differences in cell wall composition
overall, our results show significant up-regulation of a number of regulatory and cell wall-related genes in pes internodes of genotype  <dig> compared to genotype  <dig>  many of the regulatory genes that were up-regulated are putative transcription factors and receptor kinases. several of these up-regulated genes are known to play a role in the development of secondary xylem in arabidopsis . in addition, putative cesa genes that play a role in secondary cell wall development and putative genes involved in lignin synthesis were up-regulated in  <dig> pes internodes compared to  <dig> pes internodes. the up-regulation of these regulatory and cell wall-related genes may play a role in the greater cell wall concentration and modified composition of pes internodes of genotype  <dig>  on a dry matter basis, cellulose and lignin concentrations of stems of flowering plants  are significantly higher in genotype  <dig> compared to genotype  <dig>   <cit> . the greater cellulose and lignin concentrations in stems of genotype  <dig> compared to genotype <dig> are associated with an 11% increase in total cell wall dry matter and a reduction in concentration of pectin sugar residues in the cell wall. the genotypic differences in cell wall concentration and composition of pes internodes are consistent with greater deposition of secondary xylem in internodes of genotype  <dig> compared to genotype  <dig>  previous research has shown that increased development of secondary xylem increases cell wall concentration in alfalfa stems expressed on a dry weight basis  <cit> . furthermore, the thick secondary walls of this tissue are rich in cellulose, xylan and lignin, but contain little if any pectin compared to primary cell walls  <cit> . the candidate genes identified in this study, especially transcription factor genes and genes involved in secondary cell wall synthesis, may play important roles in the development of secondary xylem in pes internodes of alfalfa. future research involving transgenic approaches will be used to evaluate the role of these genes in the deposition of secondary xylem in alfalfa stems. modifying the amount and composition of secondary xylem in stems of alfalfa will improve the value of alfalfa as a cellulosic feedstock.

validation of selected candidate genes
a subset of  <dig> differentially expressed candidate genes from three functional categories  was initially selected for real-time quantitative rt-pcr validation. however, only  <dig> of these genes produced a single amplicon based on dissociation curves . most primers for real-time quantitative rt-pcr were designed using m. truncatula sequences because most probe sets selected for validation were designed from m. truncatula sequences. sequence variation between the two medicago species and among multi-gene families within species may explain the lower than expected rt-pcr success rate.

a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> candidate genes from cell wall, transcription factor, and signal transduction categories, respectively, were used for real-time quantitative rt-pcr validation . the genechip data with no masking indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate gene examined were differentially expressed between the two alfalfa genotypes. the quantitative rt-pcr validation data  revealed that of the  <dig> probes sets detected with no masking,  <dig>  were true positives . two probe sets  were identified as false positives. after double-masking the genechip data, an additional  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed . the quantitative rt-pcr validation data for the  <dig> genes that were identified only after double-masking indicated that  <dig>  were true positives. three probe sets  were identified as false positives. overall, these results indicate a significant increase in detection power after double-masking  with little change in the false positive rate.

3ΔΔct =  —  from real-time quantitative rt-pcr data. ct18s rrna values were stable in the tissues examined and were used to normalize data. *,** indicates probe sets that were detected as differentially expressed after a t-test  respectively, the t-test of the real-time quantitative rt-pcr data for pes internodes of genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> was performed with Δct values .

next, we examined the effect of double-masking on the accuracy of measuring fold-differences in gene expression by plotted ΔΔct values obtained from the real-time quantitative rt-pcr data against log <dig> values from the genechip data before and after masking . the results show a linear relationship between the ΔΔct value from real-time quantitative rt-pcr and the log ratio both before and after masking. masking increased the pearson correlation coefficient  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the stronger positive correlation between the two data sets after double-masking indicates increased accuracy.

physical mapping of differentially expressed genes
alfalfa and m. truncatula share the same eight orthologous basic chromosome sets but with different ploidy levels; 2n = 4x =  <dig> for alfalfa and 2n = 2x =  <dig> for m. truncatula. in addition, previous studies reported a significant level of colinearity in gene content and order between diploid and tetraploid alfalfa  <cit>  and also between diploid alfalfa and m. truncatula  <cit> . the medicago genome sequencing project has released genome sequence version  <dig>   which contains about  <dig> mbp of the total estimated  <dig> mbp of m. truncatula euchromatin. a total of  <dig>  non-overlapping coding sequences have been annotated to some extent with locus information to the corresponding chromosomes. to examine trends in the chromosomal distribution of genes that were differentially expressed between alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  we mapped  <dig> differentially expressed genes  onto their corresponding orthologous loci on m. truncatula chromosomes . of these mapped genes,  <dig> and  <dig> were differentially expressed in es and pes internodes, respectively . a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in both es and pes internodes of the two genotypes.

although differentially expressed genes between alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> were distributed over all chromosomes, regions of high frequency were evident . the frequency of differentially expressed genes in es and pes internodes was analyzed in a  <dig> kb sliding window along chromosomes. the results indicated possible chromosomal clustering of genes with the same expression pattern . for example, in several chromosomal segments, we observed possible clustering of genes that were up-regulated in  <dig> pes internodes compared to  <dig> pes internodes . these results suggested possible co-regulation of differentially expressed genes found in localized chromosomal regions . we used the simulation method described by grant et al.  <cit>  to statistically analyze whether the clustering patterns observed for differentially expressed genes with similar expression patterns  were non-random . the difference between experimental data  and simulated data  was considered statistically significant if the absolute value of / was ≥  <dig> . the results indicated statistically significant clustering of two to four differentially expressed genes with a similar expression pattern within both  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb windows in the genome .

¶/. value of  <dig> or greater indicates statistically significant clustering of genes.

to some degree, the clustering of co-expressed genes detected in this study may represent tandem repeats of duplicated genes. during the physical mapping process, some probe sets were targeted to closely linked multiple loci on the m. truncatula genome. if multiple loci hits per probe set were detected, we mapped only the top hit locus for each differentially expressed probe set onto the m. truncatula genome. by doing so, we reduced the chances that clusters detected in our cluster simulation analysis were due to tandem repeats of duplicated genes. thus, the majority of co-expressed gene loci used for clustering simulation analysis are sequence unrelated. previous studies conducted in other model systems reported chromosomal clustering of co-expressed genes even after removing duplicated genes  <cit> .

numerous studies have reported co-expression of neighbouring genes in eukaryotes  <cit>  including arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . co-regulated gene clusters often share the same biological functions and/or are in the same pathway  <cit> . these co-expressed genes could be regulated by the same transcription factor  <cit>  or share the same promoter elements  <cit>  for co-regulation. natural selection may promote the clustering of co-expressed genes as well  <cit> . however, the mechanism behind the clustering of co-expressed genes is still unclear.

chromosomal segments with clusters of co-expressed candidate genes will be useful for alfalfa breeding, especially for wide-crosses involving introgression of foreign chromosomal segments from alien species into elite alfalfa cultivars. in addition, the genomic dna sequence of multiple candidate genes can be obtained by sequencing a bac containing the candidate gene cluster.

CONCLUSIONS
masking biased probes due to inter-species variable  regions and sfps increased the sensitivity and accuracy of the transcript profiling data for alfalfa when using the medicago genechip as a cross-species platform. the masking protocol developed in this study can be applied to other csh studies involving the use of genechips for transcript profiling. the transcript profiling data, indicating up-regulation of putative cellulose and lignin genes involved in secondary cell wall thickening in  <dig> pes internodes compared to  <dig> pes internodes, is consistent with difference in cell wall concentration and composition between the two genotypes. numerous cell wall and regulatory genes that may contribute to differences in cell wall composition and concentration of the two alfalfa genotypes were identified. these candidate genes will be useful for improving alfalfa as a cellulosic feedstock via a transgenic approach. physical mapping and clustering simulation analysis of the differentially expressed alfalfa genes on orthologous loci of m. truncatula suggested chromosomal regions where statistically significant co-expression of neighbouring genes occurred.
