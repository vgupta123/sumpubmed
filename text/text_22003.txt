BACKGROUND
pasture legumes are used in crop rotations with cereals and oilseeds and bring the benefit of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil organic matter, soil structure and functioning as a break crop for diseases
 <cit> . neutral to alkaline soils are widespread in the southern cropping regions of australia and annual medics  are widely grown on these soils with medicago littoralis and m. truncatula  as the predominant annual medics
 <cit> . these conditions appear favourable to the root lesion nematode  pratylenchus neglectus that is widely distributed in south australian cropping soils
 <cit>  and affects all major legumes and cereal crops
 <cit> . pratylenchus spp. are migratory endoparasitic nematodes that feed and migrate within root cortical tissue causing necrosis and reduced lateral branching of roots upon infection
 <cit> . damaging the root system, rln has the potential to reduce water use efficiency, particularly in low rainfall environments
 <cit>  and can exacerbate infections by other soil pathogens. due to its wide host range, resistance and tolerance to rln has become a breeding priority in wheat and legume breeding as yield losses can be severe. in wheat, losses between 10-30% are attributed to p. neglectus, costing the wheat industry in south and western australia over $190 m each year
 <cit> . although being moderately resistant to rln
 <cit> , annual medics are intolerant, which means that they are able to inhibit multiplication of nematode numbers but suffer considerable production losses  in fields with high nematode numbers
 <cit> . in 2003– <dig>  the analysis of  <dig> soil samples from south australia suggested that over 90% of the soil samples were infested with p. neglectus and 27% of the samples contained more than  <dig> nematodes per gram of soil
 <cit> . experience based on field assays suggests that each nematode per gram soil translates into one percent of loss in yield in annual medics and severe damage to wheat, especially under low rainfall conditions where nematode-affected root systems are unable to use the sparsely available water
 <cit> .

the control of rln through use of nematicides is not a viable option as agrochemicals increase production costs and due to their non-specific side effects represent risks to human health and the wider environment. chemicals such as dibromochloropropane , a common soil fumigant for nematode control, was widely used until the mid 1980s when it was banned after being linked to causing sterility among male workers. soil steaming is another method to control nematodes but is not practical in broad acre agriculture. thus, the use of new cultivars that carry genetic resistance and tolerance are the most favoured option to reduce the impact on crop yield due to rln.

a previous germplasm screen of  <dig> strand medic lines led to the identification of the p. neglectus tolerant strand medic, rh-1
 <cit> . in order to understand the genetics of the strong nematode tolerance observed in rh- <dig>  we have established a single seed descent  population of  <dig> lines segregating for the tolerance trait. closely linked molecular markers were identified by a dual approach,  genetic map construction and  qtl analysis and fine mapping using gene-based snps. here, we report on the results of both analyses and the alignment of the genetic information to the fully sequenced m. truncatula genome encompassing a physical interval of about fifty genes.

RESULTS
phenotypic analysis of tolerance to pratylenchus neglectus
plants that were not inoculated with nematodes had negligible root damage  indicating that root damage symptoms observed in inoculated treatments was caused by the nematode. all  <dig> ssd lines were scored for root damage caused by p. neglectus with a broad range of damage observed using a rating scale of  <dig>  to  <dig>  as shown in figure 
 <dig>  highly significant differences  in root damage occurred between the ssd lines. the tolerant  and intolerant  parents responded as expected.

tolerant parent rh- <dig>  along with three ssd lines had root disease scores less than  <dig> . most commonly, the ssd lines  had root damage scores between  <dig> and  <dig>  the average damage score of the ssd population was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the most intolerant ssd line had a root damage score of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and was statistically similar to the intolerant parent herald with score  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the visual rds was highly correlated to the shoot dry weight  . the highly significant phenotypic variation between ssd lines, combined with the disparate performance of the parents made the population well suited for use in the subsequent genetic studies. the observed phenotypic distribution in the population follows a bimodal profile describing a quantitative trait controlled by a major and some minor qtl effects.

by definition, tolerance reactions enable a plant to reduce or prevent damage by nematodes while resistance hinders nematodes to multiply
 <cit> , which would be noticeable as reduced numbers of nematodes in healthy roots with a low rds value. to prove that the range of observed root damage in the parents and population lines was due to different levels of tolerance rather than resistance, p. neglectus dna was quantified in the roots of previously scored lines. the quantification of nematode dna in roots of inoculated plants showed very similar values for both parents, herald and rh- <dig>  . nematode numbers in the roots of tested ssd lines all exceeded  <dig>  regardless of rds score , supporting that the different root damage levels were caused by a tolerance mechanism of m. littoralis to p. neglectus.

genetic map construction and qtl identification
the here developed genetic map of rh- <dig> x herald contained  <dig> markers with 112 m. truncatula ssrs and  <dig> indel and caps markers. the indel and caps markers were derived from polymorphisms identified when sequencing pcr products from rh- <dig> and herald using primers that we had designed on published m. truncatula bac sequences at the tolerance locus. a highly significant qtl with a lod score of  <dig>  was identified on a linkage group that contained  <dig> ssrs and gene-derived markers that, apart from ssr , were all based on sequence information of m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> . the qtl was called qpntolml. <dig>  for tolerance to pratylenchus neglectus in m. littoralis and explained 49% of the phenotypic variation in the rh- <dig> x herald ssd population and the tolerance allele was donated by the tolerant parent rh- <dig>  information on the genetic linkage and physical position of markers that are closely linked to the qtl is summarised in table 
 <dig>  the most closely linked marker was the gene-derived caps marker stkin1bsri. the genetic distance between the most closely qtl-flanking gene-derived caps markers stkin1bsri and satnlaiii was  <dig>  cm in the m. littoralis population rh- <dig> x herald corresponding to a physical interval of ca. 36 kb. the order of all gene-derived markers on this linkage group reflected the gene order in the sequenced genome of m. truncatula . the physical distance between the genes medtr1g <dig> and medtr1g <dig> from which stkinbsri and xylnhincii were derived, respectively, spanned 412 kb harbouring  <dig> genes according to the most recent release .

marker validation in advanced breeding lines
the four qtl-flanking markers stkin1bsri, satnlaiii, xylnhincii and stkin2hinfi  were validated in  <dig> advanced breeding lines that resulted from phenotypic selection from f <dig> to f <dig> for p. neglectus tolerance and other agronomical important traits. the lines carry two different p.n. tolerance sources, from rh- <dig>  or rh- <dig> .

parent rh- <dig> showed the same tolerance allele as rh- <dig> for the four tested markers as did all available tolerant breeding lines, 5 m. littoralis lines derived from rh- <dig> x herald and 4 m. truncatula lines originating from rh- <dig>  the matching genotypes between the tolerant m. littoralis and tolerant m. truncatula ssp. tricycla breeding lines suggest that the same tolerance locus to p. neglectus, qpntolml. <dig>  is present in both related species.

comparative analysis of qtl qpntolml. <dig> in medicago and grain legumes
the genomic region of qpntolml. <dig> in m. littoralis had all gene-based markers derived from chromosome  <dig> of m. truncatula. when this region was aligned to the genomes of other legumes using the legume information system , continuous synteny blocks were identified in phaseolus vulgaris  chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  lotus japonicus chromosome  <dig>  cicer arietinum  chromosome  <dig> and glycine max  chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  transcripts of the interval-flanking genes  and the discussed five candidate genes within the physical interval of the tolerance qtl in medicago were also present in the grain legumes chickpea
 <cit>  and soybean, and to a lesser degree in common bean  .

discussion
the wide distribution and host range of pratylenchus neglectus that includes wheat, canola, chickpea and pasture legumes has made tolerance and resistance target traits in crop breeding programs
 <cit> . to date, genetic analysis has lead to the identification of five resistance qtl in wheat
 <cit>  and also in barley
 <cit>  but no resistance or tolerance qtl to this pathogen has been described in legumes. to our knowledge, this is the first report on a genetic locus linked to p. neglectus tolerance in a legume species. we refer to the observed host response as a tolerance reaction since plants with low root damage scores do not restrict or prevent nematode multiplication, which would be the case for resistance
 <cit> .

the distribution of the tolerance phenotypes  in the ssd population showed neither positive nor negative transgressive segregation with both parents as the extreme tolerant or intolerant lines. a single ssd line had a mean rds of  <dig> , which exceeded that of the intolerant parent herald but the difference was not significant. the genetic analysis of the population revealed the very strong qtl, qpntolml. <dig>  explaining 49% of the genetic variation. thanks to the m. truncatula genome sequencing efforts  and user-friendly presentation and access to the genome information, a link between genetic and physical map was straight forward.

at the tolerance qtl, the order of the m. truncatula ssrs, originally derived from bac clones, as well as the gene-based markers developed from primers designed on m. truncatula gene sequences, matched the marker order in m. littoralis. the conserved synteny between these two species of the same genus is expected as it has previously been suggested that m. littoralis is a subspecies of m. truncatula <cit>  though now accepted as separate species
 <cit> . m. littoralis and m. truncatula can be hybridised
 <cit>  and fertile hybrids have been generated to introgress desirable traits from one to the other species and cultivars have been released
 <cit> . a sequence comparison of the genomic tolerance region between m. truncatula and other legumes suggested that macrosynteny is conserved between medics, lotus japonicus and the grain legumes chickpea, common bean and soybean. in soybean, comparative analysis revealed synteny blocks to four chromosomes due to the two genome duplication events  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago
 <cit> .

assuming that each gene in the qtl interval flanked by stkinbsri and xylnhincii is also present in strand medic, the annotated gene functions  can be used to screen for candidates that might be responsible for the observed tolerance phenotype. to date, no resistance gene to p. neglectus has been cloned in any plant species but a few resistance genes to sedentary nematode species have been isolated. examples of cloned nematode resistance genes are the mi- <dig>  gene from tomato conferring resistance to three species of root knot nematodes meloidogyne incognita, m. arenaria and m. javanica <cit> ; the gpa <dig> gene in potato mediating resistance to the cyst nematode globodera pallida <cit>  and the hero gene from tomato conferring resistance to two potato cyst nematodes globodera rostochiensis and g. pallida <cit> . the structure of the mentioned nematode resistance genes is comparable to those described for viral, fungal or bacterial resistance genes, encoding nucleotide-binding sites  and leucine-rich-repeat  domains
 <cit> . notable is that the reported resistance loci contain clusters of homologous genes that can confer resistance to diseases other than nematodes, e.g. the homologous gene rx <dig> at the gpa <dig> locus mediates resistance to potato virus x
 <cit> . clusters of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> homologous genes within a 52 kb, 115 kb and a 118 kb region were observed for the mi, gpa <dig> and hero locus, respectively
 <cit> . in this study, the physical qtl interval with its predicted  <dig> genes showed no cluster of genes resembling the aforementioned resistance genes or other known resistance gene classes
 <cit> . given that the observed phenotype is tolerance and not resistance, different types of genes can be expected. the absence of typical r genes might be due to the different mode of action between resistance and tolerance. gene products that lead to tolerance might have a more direct activity on the invading nematode, e.g. by inhibiting nematode penetration or movement through the root. tolerance genes do not have to mobilize a defence mechanism that affects reproduction of the nematode in contrast to resistance, as recently observed in the resistance response of wheat to pratylenchus thornei <cit> . tolerance is simply an ability to reduce damage to the plant likely by genes encoding for proteins that can activate or are directly involved in plant defence to pathogens. whereas no typical r genes were present within the tolerance qtl, candidate genes and gene clusters that could play a role in the reduction of damage caused by invading p. neglectus were present in the interval. based on reported characterizations of homologues, the relatively small number of five genes remained to be discussed as candidate tolerance genes. two genes involved in defence-related signalling were the patatin-like phospholipase gene medtr1g <dig> and the rho gtpase gene . patatin-like phospholipases have been shown to play an active role in establishing successful defence responses against bacterial attacks. for example, silencing the plp <dig> gene in capsicum enhanced susceptibility while overexpression of caplp <dig> in arabidopsis improved the plant’s resistance to bacteria
 <cit> . rho gtpases have been linked to plant defence responses, susceptibility and cytoskeleton organization. examples of pathosystems where a role for rho gtpases has been discussed are the rice and the blast fungus magnaporthe grisea <cit>  and barley against the powdery mildew fungus blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei <cit> . the three other candidate genes for the improvement of nematode tolerance are the two qtl flanking genes sat- <dig> and xyloglucanase-specific endoglucanase inhibitor, as well as lipid transfer protein genes. the sulfate/bicarbonate/oxalate exchanger and transporter sat- <dig> could be involved in delivering a higher level of the poisonous oxalate to the site of infection or maintain a higher level in the tolerant roots constitutively. an effective defence against chewing insects due to high levels of calcium oxalate crystals has been described in medicago truncatula where mutant plants deficient in oxalate crystal formation showed clear preference and subsequent severe damage by caterpillar larvae
 <cit> . both, xyloglucanase-specific endoglucanase inhibitor and lipid transfer protein genes appeared in small clusters at the tolerance qtl interval. ltps are secreted proteins and have been proposed to support the transport of hydrophobic monomers like cutin into the cell wall to form protective layers against pathogens
 <cit> . a slightly larger gene cluster of three members was found for the gene encoding a xyloglucanase-specific endoglucanase inhibitor, referred to as xegip. this protein family and its inhibiting activity on fungal endoglucanases that target xyloglucans in plants had only fairly recently been described
 <cit>  and a large cluster has been detected in the potato genome
 <cit> .

the most closely qtl-linked marker in the ssd population was derived from the gene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase nek <dig> but nek <dig> and related kinases have only ever been reported in the context of cell cycle regulation
 <cit>  excluding it as a primary candidate for tolerance to nematodes.

the in silico screening for candidate genes conferring tolerance to p. neglectus using an advanced genome sequence draft with excellent embedded information has provided a basis for future functional analysis. candidate re-sequencing in m. littoralis, gene expression analysis, transgenesis and a detailed analysis of the infection mechanism, similar to the one described for resistance to pratylenchus thornei in wheat
 <cit>  are to follow.

at this stage, practical outputs of this research are four gene-based molecular markers that are available to track the two tolerance sources, rh- <dig> and rh- <dig>  in medicago breeding programs. the two closely linked markers flanking the p. neglectus tolerance qtl can be added to the list of breeder markers previously reported for sulfonylurea tolerance
 <cit>  and boron tolerance
 <cit>  and help to ensure that the rotation crop medicago is a competitive option in environmentally challenged low rainfall zones. moreover, with p. neglectus causing severe losses in grain legumes like chickpea
 <cit>  the identified qtl in m. littoralis represents a candidate locus for current genetics research in chickpea.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a genetic mapping approach led to the identification of a major qtl for tolerance to the root lesion nematode pratylenchus neglectus in medicago littoralis. ssr and gene-based caps markers at the qtl interval mapped physically to chromosome  <dig> in m. truncatula and comparative genome analysis suggested that the region also exists as synteny blocks in other sequenced legume genomes. thus, the identified qtl is a candidate locus for rln tolerance in pasture and grain legume species. supportive of this idea is that the linked gene-based markers derived from m. littoralis can also be used to select rln tolerance derived from m. truncatula ssp. tricycla. moreover, five genes that are predicted in the corresponding m. truncatula genome interval are likely candidates involved in reducing the root damage caused by nematodes.
