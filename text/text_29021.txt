BACKGROUND
bacteriophages , natural viral predators of bacteria, are engaged in a constant evolutionary arms race with their hosts  <cit> , playing major roles in the ecological balance of microbial life and in microbial diversity.

most double-stranded dna  phages share the same gene pool  <cit> ; however, sequence comparisons reveal a widespread horizontal exchange of sequences among genomes, mediated by both non-homologous and homologous recombination. high frequency exchange among phages occupying similar ecological niches results in a high rate of mosaic diversity in local populations  <cit> . studies confirm that phage genomes are mosaics and represent a large common genetic pool due to horizontal exchange  <cit> .

the screening of microbial natural products continues to constitute an important route to the discovery of chemicals for developing new therapeutic agents and evaluating the therapeutic potential of bacterial taxa . in this respect, actinomycetes are a group of microorganisms mostly used in biotechnology for handling bioactive compounds.  <cit> . moreover, bacteriophages can be used to detect antiviral compound production by actinomycetes. finally, actinophages are isolated and investigated because they can influence antibiotic production in bacterial strains, causing problems in the pharmaceutical industry. the vast majority of actinophages were isolated from sediments, but direct isolation from soil generally yields extremely low titers  <cit> . however, although it is difficult to grow bacteriophages from soil without enrichment, a wide range of counts has been reported  <cit> .

recently, there has been expanding interest in bacteriophages that infect streptomyces species, since the phages can support the development of cloning vectors  <cit> . such vectors could open the way for genetic manipulation as an important tool for streptomyces improvement. moreover, the mechanisms of the system for phage infection and multiplication could be useful in the fermentation industry and lead to the development of phage cloning vectors  <cit> . to date, no studies on phages isolated from s. flavovirens, an important source for several pharmaceutical drugs, such as actinomycin complex, mureidomycin and pravastatin  <cit> , have been carried out.

the development of high-throughput ngs  technologies  <cit>  and the possibility to sequence entire genomes or transcriptomes more efficiently and economically than with first generation sequencing strategies permitted the collection of large amounts of information and the analysis of sequences from hundreds of thousands of species. therefore, the dawn of next generation sequencing technologies has opened up exciting possibilities for whole genome sequencing in a wide range of organisms and the bacterial viruses have not been excluded from this revolution, despite the fact that their genomes are orders of magnitude smaller in size compared with bacteria and other organisms.

the actinophage sequence databases  currently include  <dig> genomes from putative actinophages,  <dig> of which infect streptomyces species and sixty-five of which are sequenced, but no genomes of phages isolated form s. flavovirens are currently available. the ncbi genome database contains around  <dig> caudovirales genomes to date but the number of complete bacteriophage genomes published is growing slowly  <cit> .

until now, no phages belonging to s. flavovirens have been sequenced and relatively little is known about s. flavovirens phage genomics. in the present work, we report the first whole genome sequencing study and annotation of two s. flavovirens virulent phages. the results will provide an important genomic resource for future investigations in the bacteriophages related to s. flavovirens and for phage evolution studies.

methods
source of lytic actinophages
two isolates of streptomyces flavovirens phages, named sf <dig> and sf <dig>  were obtained from the virology lab, agric. microbiology department, faculty of agriculture, ain shams university, cairo, egypt. phages were isolated from soil and the morphological properties were analyzed by standard methodology and reported in marei and elbaz   <cit> .

purification of lytic actinophages
the high titer phage suspension of each isolated phage was prepared using a liquid culture enrichment technique. the high titer phage suspension of each phage was ultra-centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. at  <dig> °c in a beckman l7- <dig> ultracentrifuge. the pellet was gently resuspended in  <dig>  ml of  <dig>  m phosphate buffer ph  <dig>   <cit> .

adsorption rate and one-step growth experiments
the adsorption experiments were carried out with two isolated phage suspensions added to spores of their indicator host . suspensions of each phage were incubated at  <dig> °c with gentle shaking. samples were withdrawn at regular intervals after inoculation.

the mycelial fragments of the indicator strain were removed by centrifugation and the concentration of phage remaining in the supernatant was counted. the adsorption rates of the two phages were determined by measuring residual plaque-forming ability in membrane-filtered samples of an attachment mixture  <cit>  and the adsorption rate constant k  was calculated  <cit> . the one-step growth experiment was performed as described by dowding   <cit> .

physiochemical stability
to evaluate the phages’ stability three different chemicals , were used. five concentrations  for each salt were employed  <cit> . to test the effect of different treatments phage solutions for both tested strains with final concentrations of  <dig> pfu/ml were utilized. the mixture was incubated for  <dig> min at room temperature . the number of plaques was determined using the double layer method   <cit> . a control test was prepared by mixing bacterial suspension with phage without the tested chemicals.

dna isolation, library preparation and whole genome sequencing
genomic dna was isolated from the propagated phages according to the procedure described by kieser et al.  <cit> . dna quality was assessed using a nanodrop bioanalyzer nd <dig> . sequencing libraries were prepared by shearing  <dig> μg of dna in blunt-ended fragments by linking the ion adapters using an ion xpresstm plus fragment library kit  according to the manufacturer’s specifications. the sized and ligated fragments were amplified by emulsion-pcr using the ion onetouch  <dig> template kit . quality and insert size distribution were assessed using an agilent bioanalyzer dna  <dig> chip. libraries were sequenced on an ion torrent pgm semiconductor sequencer  using the  <dig> bp protocol and an ion torrent  <dig> chip following the manufacturer instructions .

assembly and bioinformatics analyses
raw reads resulting from sf <dig> and sf <dig> sequencing were trimmed using trimmomatic with single end mode  and assembled separately using the gsassembler ; the graphical user interface  version was used with the default parameters. the collected contigs were visualized and validated using hawkeye  <cit> . resulting contigs for each phage showed approximately 60-fold sequence read coverage. the expected sequence accuracy was 95% with a statistical error of less than  <dig> in  <dig>  bp. sequence homologies were determined by using blastn against the actinophage database to assign the phages to a cluster  <cit> .

open reading frame  analysis and gene prediction
open reading frames  were identified and the genome sequences of each phage were annotated as described previously in dobbins et al.,  <dig> by using dna master   software and visual inspection  <cit> . for a genome-wide viewpoint an association with the annotation refinement, functional analysis and other explorations was developed using phamerator. protein sequence relationships and conserved domains within genes were also studied. gene products were grouped into “phamilies” generally referred to as “phams”, or groups of proteins with a high degree of similarity to one another. the pairwise alignment scores and significant rate were determined using blastp and clustalw  <cit> .

genomic comparisons between the sequenced and the close related phages
sequence comparisons were performed by using the blast algorithm available at ncbi  <cit>  and mauve software  <cit> . a comparison map among sf <dig> and sf <dig> streptomyces phages and closely related phages  with available genomes in the national center for biotechnology information  nucleotide database  was generated by circoletto   <cit> . for pictogram construction, bit-score values were used to describe the quality of the alignment at a given point. the bit-score is a normalized version of the score value returned by the blast searches, expressed in bits  <cit> .

the phylogenetic tree of major capsid protein  genes from two new isolated phages  and  <dig> related streptomyces phages available in the ncbi database was constructed with geneious software version    <cit>  based on the neighbor-joining  algorithm.

RESULTS
adsorption rate constant and growth characteristics of isolated phages
adsorption of sf <dig> and sf <dig> was determined using s. flavovirens cells grown in phage medium to the early exponential phase of growth . about  <dig> and 85% of all infective sf <dig> and sf <dig> particles, respectively, were adsorbed within  <dig> min of contact. the adsorption reached a maximum after  <dig> min. for both phages. the adsorption constant k was  <dig>  pl/min for sf <dig> and  <dig>  pl/min for sf <dig>  determined by the adams’s formula  <cit> . the phages adsorption rates were higher than other actinophages  <cit> , which was probably due to the strong specificity of the sf <dig> and sf <dig> phages to their host.

the production of sf <dig> and sf <dig> phages were determined in a one-step growth experiment at  <dig> °c. results revealed that the latent periods of sf <dig> and sf <dig> were approximately  <dig> and  <dig> mins, respectively. after  <dig> and  <dig> mins the maximum rise period was shown and the burst sizes were  <dig>  and  <dig>  pfu/ml for sf <dig> and sf <dig>  respectively . the present results are in agreement with the data obtained from a study on  <dig> actinophages  <cit> , underlining that under controlled cultural conditions the infection of isolated streptomycetes cells by phages was varied.fig.  <dig> one-step growth experiment for sf <dig> and sf <dig> phages development on s. flavovirens at  <dig> °c




physiochemical stability of isolated actinophages
sodium and magnesium chloride treatments yielded a significant increase in both phages’ activity for all concentrations used compared with the control, while zinc chloride application with concentrations >  <dig>  mm caused a significant decrease of activity for sf <dig> and sf <dig> . similar results were reported in previous studies . absence of calcium and magnesium ions prevents adsorption and the lysis cycle, while their presence stimulates a significant increase in phage activity, probably due to the increase of adsorption and penetration rates. on the contrary, zinc and aluminum chloride showed significant loss of infectivity in both phages. this is in accordance with the experiments performed by robert and charles, which suggested that aluminum caused viral inactivation related to the dissociation of viral capsid proteins  <cit> .fig.  <dig> effect of three different chemicals on the sf <dig> and sf <dig> infectivity




genome organization of phages sf <dig> and sf3
genome sequencing generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads for each phage with around 60-fold coverage and  <dig>  bp, and  <dig>  bp assembled sequences for sf <dig> and sf <dig>  respectively. the pair-wise alignment  <cit>  revealed that the genomes of sf <dig> and sf <dig> shared an overall high level of similarity, with conserved regions of high identity  interspersed between regions with high variability  . a similar mosaic genome structure has been observed in most other phage genomes, indicating extensive horizontal genetic exchange among phages . no close relatives  from modeling of both genome construction were revealed .fig.  <dig> genomic organization of sf <dig> and sf <dig> phages. phages were mapped using phamerator; the purple lines between phages underline the regions with high similarity, while the ruler corresponds to genome base pairs. the predicted genes are shown as boxes either above or below the genome , depending on whether are rightwards or leftwards transcribed, respectively. gene numbers are shown within each box; pink boxes refereed to the genes with high similarity between two phages while the blue boxes refereed to the genes that show low similarity. a the phages maps showed by cluster conservation. b the phages maps showed by phams; genes are colored according to their function categories “phams”




annotation of sf <dig> and sf <dig> genomes revealed  <dig> and  <dig> putative orfs, respectively. according to their homology,  <dig> out of  <dig> orfs  from sf <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig>  from the sf <dig> genome have been assigned functions compared to known conserved domains  <cit>  . isolated genes were mainly involved in dna replication and repair, nucleotide metabolism, lysis, phage structural proteins and other enzymes. the results obtained are in agreement with other bacteriophage studies . phage sf <dig> showed  <dig> orfs , named gp <dig> - gp <dig>  while  <dig> orf were identified from phage sf <dig>  from gp <dig> to gp <dig> . the majority of members of identified families are bacteriophage proteins, while others  have unknown function  <cit> .table  <dig> overview of sf <dig> phage orfs, summary of homology searches and annotations





phage structure and assembly genes
several genes code for terminase subunit proteins, such as gp <dig> and  <dig> which code for terminase_ <dig>  and terminase_ <dig>  super-families, respectively. the gp <dig> and gp <dig> genes encode for the phage portal protein , an important protein involved in dna transport during its packaging and ejection. another relevant gene is gp <dig> which, together with gp <dig> codes for the major capsid protein   <cit>  and the major capsid protein e domain   <cit> , respectively, involved in the stabilization of the condensed form of dna in phage heads. some genes involved in tail development, gp <dig>  and gp <dig> , were also identified.

in sf3we found a gene  encoding phage portal protein , crucial for dna migration and building the junction between head and tail proteins  <cit> , and others, such as gp <dig> and gb <dig>  that encode for the major capsid protein e domain   <cit>  or for lyase , like pectate lyase_ <dig> superfamily protein . a phage putative head morphogenesis protein  of  <dig> amino acids found exclusively in phage-related proteins, was encoded by gp <dig>  putaive head morphogenesis proteins such as gp <dig>  which encodesthe transcriptional activator rhar , and gp <dig>  involved in the phage terminase_ <dig>  synthesis, are activated during the beginning of double-stranded viral dna packaging  <cit> .

dna replication and metabolic genes
the gp <dig> gene encodes yaba , a protein that interacts with the dnaa initiator and the dnan sliding clamp and drives the control of dna replication initiation  <cit> . gp <dig> and gp <dig> encode for helix-turn-helix xre-family like proteins   <cit>  and histidine kinase-like atpases   <cit> , respectively, two important binding proteins with roles in the replication, repair, storage and modification of dna. gp <dig> encodes a protein belonging to the mate family , which functions as a translocase for lipopolysaccharides  <cit> , while gp <dig> codes for the golgin subfamily protein a <dig>  a protein responsible for maintaining golgi structure in intra-golgi retrograde transport  <cit> .

orfs with the same biological roles were also identified in sf <dig> phage. indeed gp <dig> encodes for a hhh-gpd superfamily base excision dna repair protein . this group includes endonuclease iii, 8-oxoguanine dna glycosylases and dna-3-methyladenine glycosylase ii  <cit> . other members include different types of dna and rna exonucleases such as rnase t, oligoribonuclease, and rna exonuclease   <cit> ; holliday junction resolvases  , endonucleases structurally similar to rnase h and hsp <dig>  which specifically resolve holliday junction dna intermediates during homologous recombination was encoded by gp <dig>  <cit> . gp <dig> encodes for hnh nucleases , an endonuclease signature which is found in viral, prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins  <cit> .

cell lysis genes
crucial genes implicated in lysis activities, such as the cell wall degradation process in bacteria during host infection, were identified in the sf <dig> genome. indeed, gp <dig> encodes for the lytic transglycosylase   that catalyzes the cleavage of the beta- <dig> -glycosidic bond between n-acetylmuramic acid and n-acetyl-d-glucoseamine, similar to “goose-type” lysozymes. gp <dig> encodespeptidoglycan recognition proteins  , namely receptors that bind and hydrolyze peptidoglycans of bacterial cell walls, and contains two conserved histidines and a cysteine, typical residues of zinc binding sites  <cit> .

while gp <dig> is included in the pectate lyase superfamily , proteins with a beta helical structure like pectate lyase and most closely related to glycosyl hydrolase family and gp <dig> encodes to peptidoglycan recognition proteins    <cit> , were identified in sf <dig> genome.

both phage genomes show up to bring a modular organization, with genes of related function clustered together . dna sequences of the first  <dig> kb in sf <dig> are highly similar to the last dna sequences in sf <dig> and encode for dna packaging structural proteins .

on the basis of the amino acid sequence similarity between the gene products, the conserved pfam <dig> motif and the gene locations, orf <dig> is predicted to encode a portal protein in both phages. no small terminase-encoding gene could be identified in either genome. the largest gene in sf <dig> genome is located in orf <dig>  encoding the lytic transglycosylase , while the largest one in sf <dig> genome with the same length is orf <dig>  encoding the major capsid protein e domain.  <cit> . a possible lyase gene is positioned distinctively in both phage genomes . those genes located downstream in both phage genomes encode proteins involved in dna synthesis, metabolism and repair .

evolutionary relationship of sf <dig> and sf3
sf <dig> and sf <dig> phages show  <dig> phams, where  <dig> out of  <dig> phams contain two members , while three members belong to pham number  <dig>  ten phams  were assigned with known functionality; the others are unknown. therefore, some of these phams are informative and can be used in evolutionary studies. indeed, as reported for mycobacteriophages  <cit> , single, ubiquitous, semi-conserved genes can be utilized for cluster prediction, useful when the whole genome sequence is unavailable. the  <dig> identified phams, which include important genes , underline a close phylogenetic relationship between the two isolated phages and provide important information that can be used in future evolutionary relationship studies by comparing the genes identified in the streptomyces flavovirens phages and homologous genes in other bacteriophages.table  <dig> related conserved domains  to the detected phamilies using phamerator




orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  as members of pham n. <dig> were assigned as phage major capsid protein  e domains; this important class of genes was also used as a single gene prediction system for the mycobacteriophage clusters analysis  <cit> . orf <dig>  and orf <dig> , members of pham n.  <dig>  were classified as phage portal proteins. these proteins were used in some previous investigations as a marker of diversity indicating, in some cases, the connections between habitat properties, microbial community structure and phage community composition  <cit> . orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  are the members of pham n. <dig>  were assigned to phage protein gp <dig>  an important tail component. most of the proteins forming the phage tail components as well as other needle-like assemblies  have a common origin from a single protein module  <cit> . this evidence emphasizes the importance of phage protein diversification and specialization in the evolution of different and complex bacterial systems and in bacterial adaptation, developing new functions and providing a distinct selective advantage  <cit> .

as expected, the virulent phages developed phams involved in lysogenic pathways. indeed, orf <dig>  and orf <dig> , grouped in pham n. <dig>  showed high homology to the pectate lyase superfamily protein that can modify the properties of polysaccharides. since the pectinolytic protein family is commonly represented in prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms and, in plants, is involved in remodelling cell walls, it is clear that the divergence from the ancestral protein over time has allowed different micro-organisms to target a range of pectin-like substrates while the overall structure has been maintained  <cit> . orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  are members of pham n. <dig> and classified as peptidoglycan recognition proteins , an innate class of immunity molecules present in insects, mollusks, echinoderms, and vertebrates that by interacting with peptidoglycan in the cell wall, rather than permeabilizing bacterial membranes, kills bacteria. these proteins were reported, at least in one carboxy-terminal domain, as homologous in bacteriophage and bacteria  <cit> . orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  are grouped in pham n. <dig> and were identified as helix-turn-helix  xre-family-like proteins, one of the early studied regulatory dna-binding proteins involved in metabolic regulation in bacteria. this class of genes encodes components to process environmental metabolites  and to produce interacting constituents in the development of a lytic or lysogenic pathway in phages. a common ancestor for all dna-binding domains was suggested and, through its duplication and divergence, the diversity of transcription regulators that drive bacterial and phage genes was generated. the hth fold investigations confirmed the significance of this module in dna–protein interactions across a wide phylogenetic spectrum including a wide variety of phages  <cit> .

orf <dig>  and orf <dig> , members of pham n.  <dig>  were classified as bacteriophage lambda head decoration protein d. since the protein allows for the display of many copies of a foreign protein, which is advantageous for displaying weak ligands for affinity selection, a useful platform for phage polypeptide display was recently developed  <cit> . interestingly, orf <dig> in sf <dig> and orf <dig> in sf <dig> were not assigned functions previously, although they belong to the pham n.  <dig> together with orf  <dig>  which is classified as terminase_ <dig> 

a standard nucleotide ncbi blast  search was developed using both sf <dig> and sf <dig> phage whole genome sequences as a query against a non-redundant nucleotide sequences database. starting from a whole phage dataset  the available phage genomes with the best identity percentages  were chosen and a pictogram was developed . seventy-eight percent identity for both s. flavovirens phages compared to the complete genome of bacteriophage vwb, isolated from s. venezuelae strain eth  <dig> , was exhibited , while 75% of identity for both studied phages with s. venezuelae phage sv <dig>  was reported, but with low query coverage , probably due to the phylogenetic distance between the compared phages.fig.  <dig> sequence similarities among sf <dig>  sf <dig>  vwb and sv <dig> phages. the picture shows the results of the blast local alignments using sf <dig> and sf <dig> as a query against the vwb and sv <dig> phages sequences. the different colours  represent the overall quality of the aligned segments along the phage sequences, evaluated on the basis of the bit-score values from the worst to the best score . the bit-score is a normalized version of the score value obtained by blast searches, expressed in bits. the height of the coloured bars in the histogram shows how many times each colour hits a specific fragment of the other phage sequences. a twist in a ribbon indicates that the local alignment is inverted 




the alignment of both sf <dig> and sf <dig> genomes against the sequences of vwb phage, carried out by mauve software, revealed that most hits occurred around a 13kb region . the approximate location of this region were  within the sf <dig> genome,  in the sf <dig> genome and  in the vwb genome. on the contrary, the alignment of both s. flavovirens phage genomes versus the sequences of sv <dig> showed only a short region  with moderate bit score ranging from 9691– <dig> and 10300– <dig> in the genomes of sf <dig> and sf <dig>  respectively, consistent with the low sequence coverage obtained.

the mcps diversity between sf <dig>  sf <dig> and  <dig> related streptomyces phages, due to a combination of illegitimate and homologous recombination  <cit>  and mutational drift, was also evaluated. the current investigation highlighted the hybrid generation between phage genera  <cit>  or phage families  <cit> . twenty-two streptomyces phages were grouped in five main branches . the lannister mcp shared a close evolutionary relationship with the izzy, aaronocolus, and caliburn sequences, demonstrating that phages may undergo genetic exchange by horizontal gene transfer from a large shared pool  <cit>  and that horizontal gene transfer between phages is a component of their evolution. numerous gene exchanges within each major clade and core phage functions do not appear to have co-evolved with specific hosts  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of studied phages and other members  of the streptomyces phages group based on mcps. bootstrap values indicate the number of times a node was supported in  <dig> resampling replications




our phylogenetic analysis is useful for further studies, since both sf <dig> and sf <dig> were recovered in a clade that included phages that infect streptomyces species but most of these phages  were members of the bg phage cluster; this clustering does not represent a phylogenetic or taxonomic grouping but rather provides a framework for reflecting their overall genome relationships and for identifying genes that have been recently exchanged and their genomic context  <cit> . moreover, sf <dig> and sf <dig> grouped in a separate branch, indicating that isolated phages belong to the bg phage cluster but represent a different sub-cluster.

CONCLUSIONS
recently, large advances have occurred in phage genomics; nevertheless,the full extent of phage diversity and evolutionary pathways are yet unknown. with the advent of ngs technologies a much greater volume of transcriptome and genome sequences is available and we can therefore expect an increased flow of new data in upcoming years. current assessment suggests that more than  <dig> phages exist on earth, representing more than ten million phage “species”. of these, less than  <dig> have been observed using electron microscopy and fewer than  <dig> genomes have been sequenced. the available sequences show that the majority of phages analyzed are tailed phages belonging to the family siphoviridae, but less is known about the degree of their genetic diversity. the genomic characterization of phages is necessary to evaluate their important ecological impact. in spite of their ubiquity, phages have not yet been characterized for many bacterial genera. in the present study, biological, physiochemical and genome sequences of two new virulent streptomyces phages are presented, representing the first genomic report of s. flavovirens phages which may represent a new sub-cluster of the bg streptomyces phage cluster.
