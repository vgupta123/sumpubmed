BACKGROUND
symbiotic association between leguminous plants and rhizobia bacteria results in specialized nitrogen-fixing structures called root nodules. the interaction between the symbiotic partners starts with the exchange of chemical signals. legumes release specific flavonoids  as signal molecules into the soil through root exudates. compatible rhizobia bacteria  respond by producing specific lipochitooligosaccharide  bacterial signals which are in turn recognized by plants  <cit>  resulting in the attachment of bacterial cells to plant root hairs. signal transduction leading to the process of nodule development commences upon recognition of compatible bacterial lcos on the root surface by the plants. the immediate responses are ion fluxes  leading to alkanization of the cytoplasm  <cit>  and within hours, the root hairs are deformed and transcription of nodulation-specific genes begins in the root cells. cells within the pericycle and cortical layers of the root initiate processes for cell division by ~ <dig> h after lco perception. by  <dig> h, the root hairs curl tightly to entrap the bacteria and subsequently transport them to deeper cell layers of the root via structures termed infection threads. bacteria colonize nodule cells, differentiate into membrane enclosed bacteroids and a mature nitrogen-fixing nodule forms in 2– <dig> weeks period  <cit> . the physiological and cytological events during nodule development have been well-characterized. in addition, a few receptors, signaling intermediates and transcription factors involved in nodulation as well as transcripts expressed differentially during nodule development have been identified . however, knowledge on the role of micrornas  during nodule development is lacking. mirnas are short ~ <dig> nt molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and have been identified in both animals and plants. in plants, mirnas have been clearly shown to regulate a number of developmental and physiological processes  <cit> .

genes encoding mirnas are complete transcriptional units and yield primary mirnas  of  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length upon transcription by rna polymerase ii. in animals, the pri mirna is integrated in to a multiprotein complex consisting of the rnaseiii-like protein drosha and its partner protein pasha. cleavage of the pri mirna by this protein complex, results in a ~ <dig> bp long fold back structure termed pre mirna which is subsequently exported to the cytoplasm. there, it is cleaved by another rnase iii-like enzyme called dicer to yield a double-stranded mirna duplex with typical  <dig> nt long 3' overhangs. in plants, the dicer homolog is thought to possess both of these cleavage activities. the mirna duplex consists of the mature mirna and its near complementary mirna* strand. this duplex associates with an argonaute  protein leading to simultaneous unwinding after which the mature mirna guides ago to complementary target mrnas resulting in silencing of the target mrna. the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the abundance of their target also differs between animals and plants. in animals, the complementarity between mirnas and their mrna targets is not very high and the repression of gene expression is caused primarily by the blockage of translation. in contrast, there is very high complementarity between mirnas and their target mrnas in plants and the repression of gene expression occurs primarily through the cleavage of mrna targets .

computational prediction of pri mirnas within the genome sequences can successfully identify mirnas. the major advantage of the method is the ability to identify mirnas independent of their abundance or spatial and temporal expression patterns  <cit> . however, it depends on the availability of extensive and assembled genome sequence data and is subject to false-discovery. an equally effective complementary approach in identifying mirnas is cloning and analysis of small rna sequences  <cit> . while this method still depends on the availability of genome sequence data for authentication, it has better accuracy. combined with the deep coverage achieved by new high through put sequencing methods, this approach may allow comparison of mirna abundance between different samples in addition to identification of novel mirnas  <cit> .

we cloned and analyzed small rna sequences from soybean roots inoculated with b. japonicum to identify conserved as well as novel mirnas that may function in symbiotic nodule development. we used soybean roots  <dig> h post rhizobia inoculation in an attempt to identify mirnas that may be early regulators of nodulation. small rna libraries were constructed from mock-inoculated and b. japonicum-inoculated soybean roots. cloning, sequencing and analysis of small rna libraries identified  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> novel candidate mirna families. of these,  <dig> families were verified to be genuine mirnas by northern expression analysis. potential mrna targets regulated by a subset of these mirnas were also verified by 5' race analysis. importantly, we identified and verified a number of mirnas differentially regulated in response to b. japonicum inoculation in soybean roots. these mirnas are likely involved in rhizobial symbiosis; so, their identification might help advance our understanding of this process.

RESULTS
cloning and sequencing of small rnas from soybean
we cloned and sequenced small rnas from mock-inoculated  and b. japonicum-inoculated  soybean roots . we obtained a total of  <dig> sequence reads from the control library and  <dig> sequence reads from the bj library using deep pyrosequencing . for computational analysis and filtering of potentially non mirna reads, we combined reads from both the libraries. for abundance calculations, reads from control and bj libraries were differentiated based on id tags. only reads with a recognizable adapter  sequence were retained for further analysis . since  <dig> sequencing is not directional, we used the 5' adapter sequence to determine the direction of each sequence read. where necessary, the sequences were converted to their corresponding reverse complements to facilitate computational analysis. adapter sequences were removed and the sequences were cleaned of low quality reads . all sequences  <dig> nt or longer in length were retained .

assessment of library quality
ideally, the length range of mirnas in the library would be 20– <dig> nt while the majority of the mirnas would be  <dig> nt in length  <cit> . however, cloning and sequencing artifacts may result in a large number of genuine mirna sequences that deviate from this expected range. we searched the sequences from both the libraries against mirbase  <cit>  to identify conserved mirnas  and used the length of conserved mirna sequences in the library as a measure of quality. the assumption is that a higher quality small rna library will be enriched in 20– <dig> nt long conserved mirnas. if a major part of the library was affected by inefficient cloning, sequencing or trimming errors, majority of the conserved mirnas will be outside the 20– <dig> nt range.

a total of  <dig> sequences in our library matched previously identified mirnas listed in mirbase . about 68% of these reads were 20– <dig> nt in length representing possibly full length mature mirnas . about 28% of the reads were 17– <dig> nt in length. these are very likely to be genuine mirnas shortened due to cloning, trimming and/or sequencing artifacts. majority of the conserved mirnas in our libraries ranged from 20– <dig> nt in length  suggesting that we had high quality small rna libraries.

identifying library sequences with perfect sequence match to known soybean sequences
the best method to differentiate candidate mirnas from other rna sequences in the library is to identify potential hairpin forming pri mirna precursor sequences in the genome that encompass the mature mirna sequence  <cit> . hence, we searched all reads in our libraries against all public soybean, genomic and expressed sequence tag  sequences available  to identify reads with perfect sequence matches to known soybean or other legume sequences. any read that did not match a known sequence in these databases cannot be used to predict precursors and these were excluded from this stage of processing. after searching for perfect match with known soybean sequences, we retained ~43% of the reads . it is expected that this would exclude some genuine mirna sequences; therefore, we determined the number of conserved mirna sequences excluded to estimate the loss of genuine mirna sequences. of the  <dig> conserved mirnas,  <dig>  remained in the analysis set  indicating that ~21% of genuine mirnas were lost due to unavailability of comprehensive genome sequence information for soybean.

removal of non regulatory small rna sequences and "orphan" sequences
small rna libraries often contain non-regulatory small rnas including trnas, rrnas, snrnas and degradation products of protein-coding rnas. we searched our library against several non-regulatory rna databases  which identified  <dig> sequences from both the libraries and all of these were excluded from further analyses . this excluded just one conserved mirna  from the library  even though it removed close to 30% of the total sequences.

to further enhance the identification of genuine mirna sequences, we eliminated all 'orphans'  and retained only 'non-orphan' sequences. differences in read length were taken into account during this process . this clean-up process removed only ~2% of genuine mirna sequences . we also excluded library sequences that hit more than  <dig> individual soybean whole genome shotgun  reads since these are unlikely to be genuine mirnas  <cit> . consistently, this step did not exclude a single conserved mirna . the above described clean-up processes resulted in  <dig> unique sequences  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt in length which were used for computational identification of mirnas.

computational identification of mirna sequences with potential hairpin forming precursors
candidate mirnas can be identified from genomic and/or est sequences by searching for the presence of potential hairpin forming precursors encompassing the mature mirna sequence present in the library. using this criterium, candidate mirnas can also be differentiated from other regulatory rnas such as sirnas  <cit> . for each candidate mirna sequence that had a perfect match in the soybean genome, we determined the ability of sequences in the surrounding region  to form a hairpin structure encompassing the mirna sequence. we identified a total of  <dig> unique sequences  that had the ability to form a potential hairpin structure of which  <dig> were novel.

the  <dig> novel precursors were subjected to folding  and these hairpin structures were manually examined if they fit the criteria  used by  <cit> . we selected  <dig> sequences that fit the criteria as candidate mirna genes. the folded secondary structures of three of our candidates are shown in figure  <dig> as examples. finally, we clustered these sequences into  <dig> different families representing novel candidate mirnas . of the  <dig> candidates,  <dig> had mirna* sequences in our library , and all three paired to their corresponding mirnas with  <dig> nt 3' overhangs . this is strong evidence that the mirna/mirna* pair originated from a dicer1-like  processing indicating that these are genuine mirnas  <cit> . of the remaining  <dig> candidates, all of the  <dig> tested were validated by northern expression analysis  suggesting that most of the novel mirnas identified in the study could be genuine mirnas.

a the most abundant read representing the family. sequences with mismatches other than overhangs were marked as additional loci.

cthe precursors of these mirnas seems to be evolutionarily related, but the mature mirnas are different from each other and we classified them as belonging to different families.

for about 55% of the conserved mirna sequences in the set used to search for hairpin-forming precursors, we identified potential precursor sequences. all of these formed hairpin structures that fit the criteria for pri mirnas . the rest of the conserved mirnas either lacked full-length cdnas or corresponding precursors in the est or wgs databases. of the conserved mirnas that we identified,  <dig> were from novel loci  previously unidentified in soybean . over all, we identified  <dig> conserved mirna families using the above approach. of these, two families also had mirna* sequences present in the library. as expected, we were able to validate several of the conserved mirna families by northern expression analysis . thus, in addition to novel mirnas, the study also revealed novel loci for conserved mirnas from the soybean genome.

identification of mirna sequences based on homology to known mirnas identified in other plant species
as mentioned previously, we searched our library against sequences in mirbase to identify conserved mirnas. we identified  <dig> different families of conserved mirna sequences in our library based on homology  comprising a total of  <dig> loci. ten of these families  had been identified in soybean earlier by screening est libraries for similarity to conserved mirnas  <cit> . by constructing a small rna library, we identified  <dig> additional families and  <dig> new loci representing conserved mirnas in soybean .

using both of these methods above, we identified  <dig> families of mirnas in soybean and of these  <dig> were novel. we also identified novel precursors and loci for conserved mirnas. the identified mirna sequences constituted about 3% of the total number of reads . this number is low compared to other recent large-scale analyses of small rna libraries  <cit> . the lower abundance in our library could be due to the fact that our library was constructed only from root tissue whereas the others were from whole plants or a combination of libraries from different tissues. in addition, our analysis excluded a large number of genuine mirnas due to the lack of comprehensive genome sequence data.

a frequency is calculated as the percentage of rnas in each class divided by the total number of rnas that matched a known soybean sequence.

b one conserved mirna  was also identified in the search for other small rnas

expression analysis and identification of b. japonicum-responsive mirnas
we examined sequences in both libraries to identify differential abundance if any of the identified candidate mirnas. candidate mirna sequences with at least  <dig> reads in both libraries combined were analyzed for abundance. as indicated in table  <dig>  there were several mirna sequences that were up- or down-regulated in response to b. japonicum treatment in soybean roots. these included novel and conserved mirnas.

a only reads with a total abundance of ≥  <dig> in both libraries combined are presented.

b frequency is calculated as the number of reads representing the family per thousand reads in the corresponding library that matched known soybean sequences. number of reads in control and bj libraries that matched known soybean sequences were  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

cthe difference in read counts is statistically significant  based on poisson's distribution analysis.

d the precursors of these mirnas seems to be evolutionarily related, but the mature mirnas are different from each other and we classified them as a novel mirna.

we performed northern analysis of selected mirna candidates with two goals.  <dig>  to experimentally validate these mirnas and  <dig>  to study the abundance of these mirna during the early phases of nodulation. all of the  <dig> novel mirnas tested were detectable by northern expression analysis . of the  <dig> conserved mirnas tested,  <dig> were detectable by northern expression analysis except mir <dig> . thus, we were able to validate a majority of the identified mirnas.

we performed a time course analysis of mirna expression from  <dig> to  <dig> h after inoculation with b. japonicum cells. interesting patterns of expression were observed for various mirnas . a set of mirnas tested were transiently up-regulated at  <dig> or  <dig> h after b. japonicum inoculation and were gradually down-regulated back to basal levels by  <dig> h . significant up-regulation at  <dig> h post inoculation and sustained induction was observed for another set of mirnas . down-regulation of a set of mirnas was also observed in response to b. japonicum . as expected, we also observed a number of mirnas that remained unaffected by b. japonicum inoculation . interestingly, we observed coordinated expression of certain mirnas implicated in signal transduction of the plant hormone auxin .

identification and verification of potential mirna targets
we sought to identify potential targets silenced by the identified mirnas in soybean. criteria and methods developed by bartel, carrington and weigel labs  <cit>  have enabled well-defined identification of potential targets for plant mirnas with very few false-positives. we used the miru online search utility  <cit>  to identify predicted targets of candidate mirnas and then examined the results manually to narrow down potential targets that fit the recently developed criteria  <cit> . the potential targets of both known and novel mirnas were identified with varying levels of confidence. the results of the analysis are presented as supplementary data . some mirna families had multiple targets, often functionally divergent with homologous sequences. in these targets, the putative mirna binding-sites were often located in highly conserved regions.

for a subset of mirnas, we experimentally verified the cleavage of selected targets by 5'-race analysis. we isolated polya rna from mock-inoculated and b. japonicum-inoculated  soybean roots and subjected the rna to a 5'-race reaction . we examined the presence of mirna-directed cleavage products by pcr using primers specific to the target of interest. we were able to verify the cleavage of target mirna for four of the identified mirna families . the targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig> are well-conserved in other species. consistently, we also observed cleavage of transcripts encoding a homeodomain protein  and a tir1-like protein  by these mirnas respectively. the identified targets of mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  in soybean seem to be non-conserved. these targets encode a putative protein kinase and a cysteine protease respectively. in all these cases, the site of cleavage corresponded to the position between the 10th and 11th nt of the mirna.

discussion
we identified  <dig> candidate mirna families from soybean roots. of these  <dig> are conserved in other plant species and  <dig> are novel and some of these novel ones might be unique to soybean or legumes. we have also experimentally verified the expression of a selected set of known and novel mirnas. the target mrnas potentially regulated by these putative mirnas were also identified using a bioinformatics approach and a subset of them experimentally validated by 5'-race analysis.

challenges in identifying mirnas from species with little genome sequence information
construction and high throughput sequencing of small rna libraries seems to be the most efficient method for mirna identification especially in species for which complete genome sequence information is not available. however, effective authentication of mirnas is still best achieved by analyzing potential hairpin forming precursors identified from genomic or est sequences. this approach identified the most number of novel mirna sequences in our analysis  and all  <dig> novel mirnas tested were validated by northern analysis . based on our estimates using conserved mirnas as internal control, this approach  identified about 49% of the conserved mirnas in our library . failure to identify the rest of the conserved mirnas was primarily due to non availability of either genome sequence data  or assembled genome shotgun sequences . analysis of our library using additional sequence data that might be available in the future  <cit>  will lead to the identification of additional novel mirnas. another approach to the identification of mirnas  is based on similarity to previously known mirnas in other species  <cit> . obviously, this approach has the limitation of not being able to identify new or species-specific mirna families. this approach has successfully identified  <dig> mirnas from soybean ests. another bioinformatics approach to identify novel mirnas from species with little or no genome sequence information is to search for est sequences with potential ability to form hairpin structures which has not been attempted in soybean to our knowledge.

we also identified conserved mirnas in our library based on homology to known mirnas listed in mirbase and this method is completely independent of the availability of genome sequence. this approach identified  <dig> families of mirnas  largely due to previous identification and characterization of mirnas from other plant species that have their complete genome sequenced  <cit> . as expected, a number of conserved mirnas were independently identified by the presence of potential hairpin forming precursor as well .

another approach to identify mirnas in the absence of a genome sequence is to identify mirna:mirna* pairs in the small rna sequence libraries themselves. we identified several conserved mirnas using this approach and at least one novel mirna which was validated by northern expression analysis . this approach may be promising for identifying regulatory rnas in species with little or no genome sequence information. the most efficient method in identifying novel mirnas seems to be the identification of potential hairpin forming precursors encompassing the mature mirna sequence of interest  in either genomic or est sequences. combined use of these approaches might be the key to unravel novel mirna loci and families in species with little or no genome sequence data.

mirna regulation during nodulation
in addition to the identification of mirna sequences, we also examined the regulation of several known and novel mirnas in response to b. japonicum inoculation in soybean roots. thus far, only one mirna has been shown to affect nodule development. the target of mir <dig>  a ccaat-binding transcription factor mthap2- <dig> has been shown to be critical for nodule development in medicago truncatula  <cit> . since mirnas largely act as 'early' regulators of signal transduction by modulating the levels of transcription factors, we chose to construct the library from soybean roots  <dig> h post rhizobial inoculation. a number of gene expression changes have been observed at this time point in soybean roots  <cit> . we observed differential regulation of mirnas that target a wide variety of target genes encoding transcription factors, receptor kinases, proteases, water channels and metabolic enzymes among others in response to b. japonicum inoculation . the differential regulation of a subset of these mirnas were also verified independently and in more detail by northern analysis . in general, for about half of the mirnas tested, the expression patterns observed by northern analysis were consistent with the abundance of mirna reads in the libraries. discrepancies could be due to differences in cloning efficiency of certain mirnas  <cit> . in addition, our analysis excluded a portion of the library due to unavailability of genome sequence data. this would also affect the abundance calculations due to missing family members/loci. in general, large-scale sequencing of small rna libraries seems to be a valid method to study mirna abundance.

our study has provided several candidate mirnas to test for their role in nodulation. for example, transient up regulation of mir <dig>  which regulates a putative apetala2-like transcription factor, down-regulation of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  targeting an hd-zipiii-like transcription factor and a cysteine protease respectively are potentially novel regulatory elements during nodulation. we also identified down-regulation of mir <dig>  shown to play a role in nodulation earlier  <cit> . at least two putative mir <dig> targets predicted in soybean are highly identical  to the m. truncatula hap2- <dig> functionally shown to play a role in nodulation. functional analyses of these novel target genes in nodulation will yield interesting and useful information on their role in nodule signaling and development.

mirna regulation of auxin homeostasis/signaling
the plant hormone auxin regulates a number of developmental and physiological processes including nodulation. several mirna loci have been suggested to play a role in auxin homeostasis/signaling. for example, mir <dig> regulates the transcript levels of auxin response activator arf <dig>  <cit>  and mir <dig> regulates the transcript levels of auxin response repressors arf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . arf <dig> and arf <dig> regulate the transcription of gh3-like genes which encode auxin-amino acid conjugating enzymes that might regulate free auxin levels in the plant. arf <dig> negatively regulates free auxin levels by upregulating these conjugating enzymes  <cit>  whereas arf <dig> downregulates them presumably increasing free auxin levels  <cit> . we observed down-regulation of an mir <dig> family member in response to b. japonicum suggesting that arf <dig> levels increase and perhaps free auxin levels as well. arf <dig> levels have also been shown to be regulated by argonaute <dig> , a core component of the risc complex  <cit> . increased levels of arf <dig> transcripts were observed in ago <dig> mutants of arabidopsis  <cit> . we also observed increasing levels of an mir <dig> family member  in response to b. japonicum. the opposite regulation of ago <dig> and arf <dig> levels in soybean roots is consistent with previous observations that ago <dig> might negatively regulate arf <dig> levels.

other mirnas suggested to play a role in auxin signaling include mir <dig> that regulates the auxin receptor tir <dig> and mir <dig> that regulates the levels of a nac <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . these mirnas were up- and down-regulated respectively in response to b. japonicum inoculation in soybean roots. these observations suggest that endogenous regulatory rnas might modulate auxin signaling and/or homeostasis during nodulation. while it still needs to be confirmed if the corresponding targets are silenced and what role they play in nodule signaling and development, these data provide an entry point for the study of mirna regulation of early auxin signaling during nodulation.

CONCLUSIONS
cloning and sequencing of ~ <dig> small rnas from b. japonicum-inoculated soybean roots and further bioinformatics analyses identified  <dig> families of mirnas of which  <dig> were novel. we estimated that our study identified ~50% of the mirnas in soybean genome. the availability of complete soybean genome sequence and its assembly would enable the identification of most of the remaining mirnas. we also identified a number of mirnas differentially regulated by b. japonicum inoculation. results from the study might help advance our understanding of legume-rhizobia symbiosis.
