BACKGROUND
haemophilus influenzae is a frequently isolated member of the commensal microbiota of the human nasopharynx that also causes a variety of diseases including invasive infections  as well as diseases resulting from contiguous spread within the respiratory tract, such as otitis media, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, epiglottitis, and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . an important question is the extent to which genotypic variation within the species, especially that which affects surface expressed structures such as capsule, lipopolysaccharide  and outer membrane proteins , influences pathogenesis.

within naturally occurring populations of transformable bacteria, it has been proposed that each strain in a population contributes to and can acquire genes from the pan-genome 
 <cit> . this hypothesis suggests that genetic exchange, especially through transformation-mediated homologous recombination, plays a major role in shaping the diversity of h. influenzae, and that these variations affect commensal and virulence behaviour. if so, investigations that detail the extent of the genomic diversity of the species and the mechanisms by which this diversity is transferred between strains are important for understanding both the population dynamics and characterising the genetic basis of the differences in severity and spectrum of disease associated with particular strains.

h. influenzae was the first free-living organism to have its genome sequenced
 <cit> . this breakthrough marked the beginning of the “genome age” and offered the potential to gain more detailed information on the population structure of the species than current methods, including multi-locus sequence typing 
 <cit> . however, the availability of complete genome sequences for only a few strains is insufficient to interrogate the extent of the genetic diversity of h. influenzae and its close species relatives. in this study, a detailed analysis of  <dig> h. influenzae type b  strains compared to a common reference identified regions of high snp density or sequence mismatches consistent with inter-strain exchange of dna most plausibly derived from other h. influenzae strains through transformation, rather than phage or conjugative transfer. further evidence for the role of transformation in the import of novel sequence flanked by regions of dna found in both the donor and recipient was obtained through sequencing dna obtained from a pool of strains each transformed with dna from a heterologous donor hib strain.

RESULTS
whole genome sequencing of  <dig> strains of haemophilus spp
the genomes of  <dig> strains of haemophilus spp.  were sequenced using the illumina gaii platform. for  <dig> of these strains where sufficient coverage had been attained, genome sequences of between  <dig>  mbp to  <dig>  mbp in length were assembled by velvet
 <cit>  . the sequencing and assembly resulted in between  <dig> and  <dig> contigs per strain with a median of  <dig> contigs per assembled genome. the genome sequences were partial and the %g+c content of these  was higher than expected based on data from other completed h. influenzae genomes . dna similarity searches and mapping of the sequence reads using maq
 <cit>  confirmed that the higher %g+c regions of the genomes had been preferentially sequenced, a known issue with early versions of the illumina sequencing chemistry. we estimated the average genome coverage to be 83%, based on comparison with extant complete h. influenzae genome sequences; this data represents a ten-fold increase in the amount of genome sequence information available for h. influenzae.

the  <dig> strains selected for genome sequencing are listed along with respective information on serotype, isolation, and associated disease. the total length of the genome sequence following assembly is listed  for each strain. the  <dig> strains below the horizontal line are those for which the quality of the assembled genome sequence was insufficient for the sequence data to be included in subsequent analyses.

* strains were originally designated as nt.

the genome assemblies were aligned in a pair-wise fashion using mauve
 <cit> . the length of the aligned portion of genomes achieved between any pair of strains, expressed as a percentage of the genome sequence length, was used as a measure of the relatedness of the strains. these pair-wise relationships were displayed as a heatmap using the r statistical package included within the analysis software . this method of ordering of strains is dependent on each having a similar degree of sequence coverage, and hence assembly length, thus the analysis was confined to data for the  <dig> genomes of h. influenzae and h. haemolyticus sequenced in the same flow cell . a tree obtained following a simpler snp-based analysis of the genome sequences  gave an overall similar grouping of strains, validating the output from the mauve analysis.

whole genome alignment reveals details of the genetic relationships of h. influenzae type b strains
although this approach cannot give information on detailed phylogenetic relationships, it did allow the identification of some major groups and many sub-groups of strains  that were plausible and consistent with previously published analyses. strains expressing a capsule fell into two groups  distinct from other h. influenzae strains. hib strains were found only in two closely positioned sub-groups  which, interestingly, also included four strains that had originally been designated as non-typeable by serological tests . blast analysis of these four genome sequences revealed a type b capsule locus in each case and all four strains were recorded as being isolated from csf, or were associated with meningitis. we suppose that loss, or reduction, of type b capsule expression in these strains may have occurred during isolation and/or culture in the laboratory.

based on the output from mauve analysis, we selected hib strains to analyse, in more depth, the differences in genome content that shape this level of diversity within the species. we used read-mapping by maq to investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms  between  <dig> hib strains included in our genome sequence database and a common reference . strain rm <dig>  originally designated non-typeable was excluded as it was not a member of this hib group based on mauve analysis . conversely, we included strain plmiog2822h-l, a type b strain that had been wrongly classified as h. haemolyticus. sequence reads were mapped onto a complete reference hib genome sequence  and used to identify snps for all hib strains. the hib groupings observed  were essentially the same as those observed by mauve analysis . based on the location and number of snps, the β <dig> strains can be sub-grouped into β1a-β1e, and strain rm <dig> contains sufficient differences to constitute a separate group  from the β <dig> strains . genome sequence data provides greater resolution in characterising divergence of strains that share identical or similar mlst profiles. for example, when we compared the patterns of snps of the sub-grouped β1a-β1e strains to their respective mlsts, we found that strains rm <dig> and dc <dig> shared similar blocks of snps when compared to strain  <dig>  in a pattern indicative of a common vertical inheritance. strains rm <dig> and dc <dig> had differed by two mlst alleles . strains rm <dig> and eagan also differed by two mlst alleles but differed by  <dig>  snps in comparison to strain  <dig> 
 <dig> are labelled on the right hand side. regions marked at the bottom of the figure represent genome segments which are present in the reference strain  <dig> but that may not be found in all other strains. the brackets on the left hand side of the figure indicate the number of mlst alleles shared between the pairs of genomes indicated; the sequence type  of each strain is indicated to the right of its name.

distribution of snps in hib strains indicates putative transformation events and evidence of loss and gain of genes between hib strains
the snps in the genomes representative of the three lineages of hib strains  were compared in more detail to the hib strain  <dig>  reference genome . with respect to the reference genome, β <dig> strains had between  <dig> and  <dig>  snps and β <dig> strains had between  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps . in the β <dig> strains the number of snp-dense regions was low, whereas there were many more snps in the β <dig> strains due to their greater phylogenetic difference from the reference. the single ψ strain had  <dig>  snps . although the β <dig> strains and the ψ strain had a broadly similar number of snps, they were clustered in patterns that were distinct between the groups, a finding consistent with regions of high snp density likely representing distinct recombination events.

we hypothesised that “blocks” of dna sequence with a high frequency of snps, separated by regions of the genome with low snp density, could each represent an individual transformation event . to investigate this, we analysed two strains  that have the same multi-locus sequence type. rm <dig>  the strain most closely related to the reference strain  <dig>  has five blocks of snps. for this analysis, blocks were defined as contiguous regions containing at least  <dig> snps, with each snp separated by no more than  <dig> bp. 91% of  <dig> snps between strains rm <dig> and  <dig> were found within these five blocks, amounting in total to  <dig>  kbp of dna, or  <dig> % of the genome. strain rm <dig> had  <dig> blocks of snps when compared to strain  <dig>  equivalent to  <dig> % of the genome. in the β <dig> strains, the size of these blocks ranged from less than  <dig>  to more than  <dig> kbp, with a median size of  <dig>  kbp , findings within the range recently reported experimentally for h. influenzae strains
 <cit> . we concluded that the blocks of snps identified between the closely related hib strains represented recombination events, resulting in allelic exchanges that could delete or insert novel dna, including whole genes.

inserted or deleted regions of dna in hib strains, relative to the genome sequence of reference strain  <dig>  were identified by blastn searches and the act genome browser. for a closely related strain, dc <dig>  an example of insertion of a novel block of snps, mediated through transfer of dna from an unknown donor, was identified. this inserted dna included a putative gene flanked by regions of significant similarity. as a further example, comparison between two more divergent genomes  revealed at least  <dig> regions of dna, each over  <dig> bp in length, that were present in one strain but not the other . these regions constitute over  <dig>  kbp or approximately 1% of the genome sequence length. similarity searches using blastx revealed that eleven of the  <dig> regions contained sequences associated with phage proteins found in h. influenzae and related species. the remaining five regions encoded a putative trna-dihydrouridine synthase c, a predicted transcriptional regulator , a transport protein, and hia and hap proteins.

experimental assessment of h. influenzae transformation
high throughput sequencing provides a useful experimental tool to examine in detail the recombination events associated with the transfer and exchange of dna between h. influenzae strains through transformation. to this end, we investigated the transformation of dna from a hib strain donor into a high efficiency recipient strain. to ensure that each transformant was the result of a recombination event we used a spontaneous, high level streptomycin resistant  derivative of strain eagan , possessing a point mutation in rpob. spontaneous strr mutants were infrequent . compared to strain rd, the donor strain eagan genome sequence had  <dig>  snps relatively uniformly distributed throughout the genome  including the region around rpob, the location of the strr mutation. following transformation and selection on streptomycin,  <dig> independent rd+eaganstrr colonies were pooled, the genomic dna sequenced and mapped to the rd reference genome sequence using the maq programme to identify snps. the number of rd+eaganstrr transformants carrying each snp was estimated from the pooled sequence using the snpseeker script
 <cit>  and is plotted in figure 
 <dig>   <dig>  snps consistent with transfer from eagan  were found in the rd+eaganstrr transformants. we identified  <dig> snps that were common to all respective sequence reads, were not linked closely to other snps and were found in both rd+eaganstrr and rd+eagan transformants obtained in control experiments using non-strr eagan dna as donor. we conclude that these snps were consistent with, and most likely explained by, errors within the reported rd genome sequence published in  <dig>  another possibility, not mutually exclusive with sequencing errors, could be sequence drift in our laboratory strain  when compared to the sequenced isolate . this level of error is similar to the several hundred snps reported upon re-sequencing of strain rd by other investigators
 <cit>  and comparable with the  <dig> discrepancies found between the original  <dig> e. coli strain mg <dig> genome sequence
 <cit>  and the  <dig> re-sequencing
 <cit>  of the same strain.

in the rd+eaganstrr transformants, a large peak in snp density centred on the site of the point mutation in rpob conferring strr . moving outwards from this central snp peak, the eagan-specific snps decrease at a relatively constant rate such that within  <dig> kbp of the strr mutation the frequency of strains containing eagan-specific snps decreases at approximately  <dig> strain/ <dig> bp. across the  <dig> transformants, the region of the genome involved in recombination events centred on the strr locus would appear to span an arc of the genome over  <dig> kbp in size . given that the strr locus can be at any location in the recombined block of dna, this indicates a maximum size for the recombined block of at least  <dig> kbp.

in addition to the intense peak centred on the strr conferring snp, secondary small peaks of snps can be observed at other locations in the genome. these secondary peaks contain eagan strain-specific snps at a frequency of approximately  <dig> % , a finding consistent with the occurrence of secondary transformation events in individual strains. these data serve to emphasize the significant impact of transformation in promoting changes in genome sequence between strains through the frequent uptake and recombination of one or more fragments of chromosomal dna.

discussion
the sequencing of whole genomes from multiple strains provides a powerful means by which to examine the diversity within a bacterial species. we sequenced the genomes of  <dig> selected strains of h. influenzae and closely related haemophilus spp. the approximately  <dig> times depth of coverage for the genomes provides a substantial increase in the existing sequence information that can expand our understanding of the gene content and organisation of h. influenzae. the potential role of horizontal transfer of dna through transformation in shaping the diversity of h. influenzae is illustrated by our detailed analysis of snps in the genome sequences obtained for  <dig> h. influenzae type b  strains. through pair-wise alignment of genome sequences, we identified regions of high snp density , or sequence mismatches, that were consistent with inter-strain exchange of dna. further, in the six strains most closely related to the reference genome of strain  <dig>  we identified the beginnings and ends of these “blocks” that were up to  <dig> kbp in size with a median size of  <dig>  kbp . strains of identical mlst type display allelic variation, insertions and deletions that can include complete genes most plausibly derived from other h. influenzae strains through transformation. these variations may be associated with important biological differences since they can involve sequences within genes such as hap and hif that are determinants of microbial-host interaction.

in a recent publication , mell and colleagues allude to the natural variation within h. influenzae but do not characterise it. here we document both the details and pattern of such sequence variation in several hib strains, variations that are consistent with recombination, most plausibly achieved through dna transformation. to provide further independent evidence for the role of transformation, we analysed  <dig> laboratory transformants that were made using donor and recipient strains of known genotypes.

each transformant contained clusters of donor-specific snps that represent recombinational events through transformation. the sizes of the respective chromosomal segments involved are evidently up to  <dig> kbp in some transformants, somewhat larger than those reported recently  for other transformations carried out in h. influenzae <cit> . both the extent of the region of the chromosome involved in recombination events, and the possibility of secondary transformation events targeting other positions in the genome, provide good evidence indicating the potential for transformation to substantially impact on genome evolution in this bacterium. our findings provide evidence that transformation-mediated homologous recombination plays a major role in shaping the diversity of natural h. influenzae populations and that individual strains contribute to and can acquire genes from the superset of all genes of the species
 <cit>  as has been shown also in other bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> . the “pan genome” is a resource from which specific strains can draw to allow the effective trialling of new alleles and genes in different genome backgrounds and which, through natural selection, promote survival and adaptation of h. influenzae within its obligate host, humans. the significant genetic divergence of genomic sequence, documented here for type b strains, but doubtless characteristic of the species as a whole, can provide information about the biological differences between strains that may determine in part the variations in commensal and pathogenic behaviour of the species.

the availability of whole genome sequencing raises the question of how best to determine the relatedness of strains of bacteria, especially in species where there is known to be substantial recombination. for h. influenzae, the relationships between strains inferred by the number of shared genes and the sequence similarity in house-keeping genes yield different tree topologies
 <cit> , indicating that the assumptions which underlie these methods do not reconcile phylogenetic relationships. transformation and other mechanisms of recombination in h. influenzae are strong forces which can distort the perceived phylogenetic relationships between strains based on sequence similarity. it is evident from the strains examined in detail in this study that despite the genetic variation identified, there is considerable conservation of the genome between most strains. however, there are genetic elements in h. influenzae genomes which mediate genetic variation at a rate greater than ‘natural’ transformation. mobile genetic elements such as phage and integrative and conjugative elements  promote more rapid genome evolution in response to strong selection pressure, such as the use of antibiotics in the human host. the ice in h. influenzae is responsible for significant spread of antibiotic resistance in the bacterium and is able to cross the barrier to other species, such as h. parainfluenzae <cit> , at a rate which is greater than that predicted to be achievable through transformation.

CONCLUSIONS
the pair-wise alignment of whole genomes, using mauve, provided us a useful means to inform on relationships between strains that are influenced by frequent recombination. our findings provide evidence that transformation-mediated homologous recombination plays a major role in shaping the diversity of natural h. influenzae populations and that individual strains contribute to and can acquire genes from the superset of all genes of the species.
