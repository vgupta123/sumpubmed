BACKGROUND
entamoeba histolytica, the etiological agent of amoebiasis, is a protistan parasite that lives in the human intestine. amoebiasis is the third leading cause of death due to parasitic disease  <cit> . according to the who, about 40– <dig> million people are infected annually causing approximately  <dig>  deaths worldwide. about 90% of the infections with this parasite remain asymptomatic  <cit> .what leads to the varied outcome of infection is not known, but it is possible that the genotype of the strain influences the outcome  <cit> . the suggestion has been made that inherently avirulent strains exist that may be associated with unique genotypes  <cit> . the e. histolytica strain rahman is considered to be avirulent in axenic culture since it shows reduced cytopathic activity on epithelial cells and does not form liver abscesses in animal models  <cit> . data are, however, insufficient to assign virulence properties to specific genotypes of e. histolytica.

retrotransposons without long terminal repeats are generally called long interspersed nuclear elements  and their short non autonomous partners are called sines  <cit> . lines are generally ~5 kb in length and encode the functions required for retrotransposition, while sines are short and do not code for proteins. they utilize the line-encoded proteins for their own retrotransposition. both lines and sines are efficient genome invaders and are widespread in eukaryotes  <cit> . in e. histolytica the ehlines  and ehsines  constitute  <dig> % of the genome  <cit> . they belong to three closely related families, of which ehline1/ehsine <dig> are the most abundant. these elements are present mostly in the intergenic regions  <cit> , with a t- rich sequence within 50 bp upstream of the site of insertion  <cit> . due to their mobile nature they can occupy different genomic locations and may influence the phenotype of the organism by activating or silencing the genes in their vicinity. previous work has shown that a number of sine <dig> occupied sites in e. histolytica are unoccupied in the non pathogenic species entamoeba dispar and vice versa  <cit>  which may have important consequences for the pathogenicity of the parasite.

a number of studies in different organisms have utilized sines as useful markers for phylogeny  <cit> . it has been argued that sine insertion analysis is one of the best methods for determining relationships of closely related species since sines are widely dispersed in the genome and, unlike dna transposons, there is no evidence of any process that removes sines from the genome once they are inserted. nonspecific sine deletions due to unequal crossing over are relatively rare. thus the absence of a sine at a particular locus signifies the ancestral state. the probability of independent insertions at the same locus is exceedingly low, which links sine-containing loci as related by descent  <cit> . for these reasons population genetic analysis can be performed more accurately with sines than with rflps and microsatellite loci . here we have explored the possibility of using ehsine insertions as strain-specific markers.

several methods have been developed for the genotyping of this parasite  <cit> , which have their individual limitations. polymorphisms are observed in short tandem repeat numbers, and repeat sequences present in the genes encoding chitinase and the surface antigen srehp, as well as in the arrays of trna genes of e. histolytica. these have been utilized successfully for strain identification  <cit> . however the size variation in most of these loci is small, sometimes making it difficult to detect polymorphism by agarose gel electrophoresis, so dna sequencing is normally used for confirmation. a transposon display technique was also devised for strain identification based on the genomic distribution of ehsine <dig>  <cit> . however, this method is not suitable for use with clinical isolates.

here we analysed  <dig> ehsine <dig> and  <dig> ehsine <dig> loci present in the hm-1:imss strain of e. histolytica for insertion polymorphism in other sequenced strains   <cit> . seventeen loci were found  that showed insertion polymorphism. of these, six loci were validated experimentally in strain rahman. three of these loci were tested in  <dig> other axenically grown strains and  <dig> clinical isolates. each of the loci gave a single specific amplicon with the primer sets used, making this a suitable method for genotyping. we also report a bioinformatic analysis of ehsine <dig> elements.

methods
analysis of polymorphic loci
the e. histolytica hm-1:imss genome sequence is available in  <dig> scaffolds as the full genome could not be assembled into chromosomes. the sequences were downloaded from ncbi . different strains of e. histolytica, namely hm1:ca, ds4- <dig>  ku <dig>  ku <dig>  ku <dig>  ms96- <dig> and rahman were downloaded from amoebadb   <cit> . these are partially assembled sequences obtained using next generation sequencing technologies.

table  <dig> shows statistics of the genome sequences used in the study. a database of ehsine <dig> elements was built based on the results generated by huntley et al. <cit> . a total of  <dig> ehsine <dig> elements were included. elements that were less than 450 bp were omitted. flanking sequences of 1000 bp from both 5′- and 3′-ends of all ehsine <dig> elements were extracted using a perl code. the flanking sequences were mapped separately to the contigs of the various strains of e. histolytica using blast  <cit>  and only when both flanking sequences of a specific sine element mapped to a single contig was it used for further analysis. presence of ehsine <dig> was scored when the distance between the flanking sequences in the target strain was found to be greater than or equal to 450 bp. on the other hand, if the distance between the flanking pairs was less than or equal to 100 bp then the sine was considered to be missing. all results were validated by manual inspection. similarly all the ehsine <dig> copies having a length greater than 400 bp and similarity of more than 70% with the ehsine <dig> consensus sequence  <cit>  were extracted from the e. histolytica hm-1:imss genome. this resulted in  <dig> ehsine <dig> copies, which were analysed for their locus occupancy in the various sequenced strains.

axenic and xenic cultivation of e. histolytica- axenic strains hm-1:imss and rahman were maintained by continuous subculturing in tyi-s- <dig> medium  <cit> , and the rest of the axenic strains were maintained in lyi-s- <dig> medium  <cit> . xenic strains were maintained by continuous subculturing in robinson′s medium  <cit> .

genomic dna isolation- genomic dna of axenic and xenic e. histolytica strains was isolated using a genomic dna isolation kit  and the qiaamp® dna mini kit , respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

polymerase chain reaction  - primers were designed from the flanking sequences of different ehsine <dig> copies obtained from the e. histolytica hm-1:imss database . all pcr reactions were performed with biotools dna polymerase ; the pcr programme consisted of initial denaturation for 5 min at 94°c followed by 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°c, annealing for 30 sec at a temperature dependent on the tm of the primers used, and an extension time at 72°c dependent on the size of amplicon. products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel  containing  <dig>  μg/ ml of ethidium bromide using  <dig> x tbe  buffer.

southern blotting and hybridization- dna was transferred to hybond™-n + nylon membrane  using standard methods  <cit> . labeled probes were prepared using α-32p–datp by the random priming method using the neblot kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. blots were hybridized overnight with probe at 65°c in a solution of 1% sds, 1 m nacl and 100 μg/ml of salmon sperm dna, washed to remove nonspecific probe, exposed  and scanned by phosphorimager.

dna sequencing- amplicons were extracted from agarose gels using a gel extraction kit  and cloned into the pgem-t vector . sequences were generated commercially  and compared using clustalw software .

analysis of target site duplication  and internal repeats  using meme- the online tool meme  <cit>  was used for the analysis of tsds and irs of sine <dig>  50 bp of sequence upstream and downstream of the ehsine <dig> were extracted from the e. histolytica hm-1:imss genome and these were analysed for tsd. since the longest tsds found were in the range of 16–20 bp, and some of the shorter tsds may result from accumulation of mutations in older sine insertions, tsds having size < 8 bp were excluded. the input consisted of  <dig> fasta formatted sequences of tsds with the default settings of width  and the search was optimized for identifying zero or one motif per sequence. for ir analysis  <dig> sequences were subjected to meme analysis in a similar way.

RESULTS
identification of genomic loci with differential ehsine1/ehsine <dig> occupancy in the sequenced e. histolytica strains
the availability of genome sequences of a number of e. histolytica strains is likely to help define the level of polymorphism in sine distribution in e. histolytica. ehsine <dig>  and ehsine <dig>  constitute the majority of the sine population of e. histolytica. there are only  <dig> copies of ehsine <dig>  <cit> , therefore we focused only on ehsine <dig> and ehsine <dig> for this study. out of  <dig> copies of ehsine <dig>   <dig> are full-length   <cit> , and only full length copies were used for analysis. we performed a similar analysis with ehsine <dig> and found  <dig> full length copies  in strain hm-1:imss.

insertion polymorphism of ehsines  <dig> and  <dig> was detected by comparing the genomic location of all full length copies in strain hm-1:imss with the same loci in strain rahman . flanking sequences surrounding each sine  were taken into consideration in identifying the sine-containing loci. an element was considered to be present when along with sine the flanking sequences were the same in the two strains. the results of this analysis are presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  out of  <dig> full length ehsine <dig> copies it was possible to do this analysis for only  <dig> due to an inability to extract one of the flanking sequences for the rest, because either the sine was present at the end of the scaffold or was flanked by repetitive sequences . further, out of these  <dig> copies, full length ehsine <dig> copies could be clearly mapped in rahman in only  <dig> cases; in others this was not possible as the upstream and downstream sequences were in different scaffolds of rahman. additionally, we did not consider  <dig> ehsine <dig> loci as there were undefined nucleotides at many positions. finally, we found  <dig> loci where the flanking sequences in strains hm-1:imss and rahman were conserved but the ehsine <dig> sequences were completely missing in rahman, as against  <dig> loci where ehsine <dig> was present in both strains.

similarly, out of the  <dig> full-length copies of ehsine <dig> it was possible to use only  <dig> copies for our analysis , and only  <dig> unoccupied sites were identified in rahman following the criteria described for ehsine <dig>  since the total number of unoccupied sites obtained was rather small , we checked to see if we were missing some polymorphic loci in the copies that could not be computationally analyzed. pcr primers were designed using the genes flanking a number of ehsine <dig> loci in hm-1:imss and were used to amplify the same loci from genomic dna of strain rahman. a total of  <dig> loci were tested from the various categories listed in figure  <dig>  of these, the amplicon size in rahman was identical with hm-1:imss at  <dig> loci, showing that these loci were all occupied, while at the remaining two loci  the ehsine <dig> was absent from rahman. locus  <dig> was missed in the computational analysis because the sequence of the sine, and some sequence upstream of it, contained undefined nucleotides in rahman. in the case of locus  <dig> the corresponding sequence was located in three different contigs in rahman. therefore the combined experimental and computational analysis allowed us to identify  <dig> ehsine <dig> loci that are polymorphic between strains hm-1:imss and rahman.

a number of e. histolytica strains , for which next generation sequencing  data are currently available, were analyzed using the approach described above. since ngs output is in the form of short sequence reads which are assembled into a large number of scaffolds, it is likely that a number of polymorphic sites were missed in this analysis. a total of  <dig> polymorphic loci  were found . out of the  <dig>   <dig> loci were polymorphic in more than one strain. the results suggest that sine insertion polymorphism is widespread among strains and isolates of e. histolytica. analysis of sequence in the database at sites where the sines were scored absent showed that in some cases a small fragment of the sine sequence was still present, and in some others a part of the flanking sequence was missing . we cross-checked this by sequencing some of these loci in rahman and present evidence below that there was actually no sine sequence left at these loci, and the reported sequence in the database was erroneous. such assembly errors may be expected when dealing with highly repetitive sequences. we have not cross-checked all the loci and cannot comment on the status of these.

ehku50_3346
 <dig> ehsine <dig> and  <dig> ehsine <dig> loci of hm-1:imss were unoccupied in the various sequenced strains . identical unoccupied loci in different strains have been indicated by identical shapes.

*these loci have been tested in the respective strains and found completely unoccupied, in conflict with the sequence data available in amoebadb.

of the eight predicted polymorphic loci in strain rahman we validated experimentally six using pcr  with primers designed from the flanking sequences of ehsine1/ehsine <dig> in hm-1:imss . the absence of sine sequences was inferred from the size of the amplicon  and by southern hybridization using a sine sequence as a probe. the amplicon sizes in rahman from three ehsine <dig> polymorphic loci  were smaller by about 550 bp suggesting that indeed these sites lacked ehsine <dig>  this was also confirmed by southern hybridization . in contrast, the amplicon size of another polymorphic ehsine <dig> locus  was actually larger by  <dig>  kb in rahman. probing a southern blot of the amplicon using ehsine1-flanking sequences from locus  <dig> confirmed that the amplified region in rahman indeed belonged to the same locus . however, two different sets of primers designed using the hm-1:imss sequence at this locus failed to produce an amplicon in rahman. therefore it appears that this locus may have undergone multiple changes and is not a simple case of sine absence. we did not analyse this locus further. the two predicted ehsine <dig> polymorphic loci  were also validated using pcr and southern hybridization . at both loci the amplicons from rahman were 700 bp shorter .

these loci were also found to be polymorphic among different strains and isolates of e. histolytica as deduced from analysis of ngs data . in some strains, although the sine was present at the locus, the sequence showed some truncations or short deletions. if these changes are not due to assembly errors in the database one could envision various factors that may contribute to this. most of the truncations were at the 5′-end of the sine, which could result from the well known phenomenon of incomplete reverse transcription of the sine rna template during retrotransposition  <cit> . short deletions may appear due to recombination between genomic sine copies, or due to replication slippage at the short internal repeats in the ehsines . however, some of these changes are, indeed, due to sequence assembly errors in the database, which we document below for locus  <dig> in strains rahman and ms96- <dig> 

sequence analysis of some of the polymorphic loci in strains hm-1:imss and rahman
sequence data available for the two genomes in amoebadb shows that the assembled genome data of rahman has many more undefined regions and gaps. there are  <dig> scaffolds defining the hm-1:imss genome  compared to  <dig> of rahman  and  <dig> unassembled contigs. we examined the sequences at loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> more closely and found that the locus  <dig> sequence was located in a single scaffold in both strains and the sequence was identical except for the loss of ehsine <dig> in rahman. however, the sequences at the other loci were either found in multiple scaffolds/contigs in rahman, or contained undefined regions, as described below.

locus  <dig> was present in scaffold ds <dig>  and ehrmscaffold_ <dig> . closer examination showed that although most of the ehsine <dig> sequence was missing at this locus in rahman, a stretch of 84 bp still remained at the 5′ end . this was followed by a large region of undefined sequence , and if this is an accurate estimate of its size we should obtain amplicons of similar size in both strains. however our data clearly showed that the amplicon in strain rahman was shorter by  <dig>  kb and it did not hybridize with a probe from ehsine <dig> sequence . to further verify our results we cloned and sequenced these amplicons from both the strains. sequence comparison showed that the entire stretch of ehsine <dig> was missing in rahman . ehsine <dig> insertion is typically accompanied by target site duplication  and the rahman sequence had only one copy of the tsd seen in hm-1:imss. the rest of the flanking sequence was identical in the two strains. the 84 bp piece of ehsine <dig> shown in the database at this locus was not found in our sequence; rather the entire ehsine <dig> was missing. we believe this discrepancy could have arisen due to assembly errors in the database.

locus  <dig> was present in the scaffolds ds <dig>  and ehrmscaffold_ <dig> . the sequence upstream of the ehsine <dig> location in hm-1:imss was undefined in rahman. however we found three unassembled contigs  in the rahman database that matched the hm-1:imss sequence . an amplicon from rahman generated by pcr amplification using a primer each designed from ehrmcontig_ <dig> and ehrcontig_ <dig> displayed the expected size , showing that these contigs likely belong to this locus. sequence analysis of the amplicon confirmed that the two strains were identical except for the loss of ehsine <dig> in rahman .

locus  <dig> in hm-1:imss was in one scaffold , while in rahman the syntenic sequence was present across three different scaffolds/contigs . one contig spanned the downstream gene sequence with which primer  <dig>  r was an exact match. however, in primer  <dig>  f  the 3′ nucleotide was a mismatch. sequence comparison of this region revealed single nucleotide differences at several positions, which may explain our failure to amplify this locus from rahman using hm-1:imss primers.

these results suggest that some of the sequence data currently available in the database needs reanalysis and the predictions need to be validated by experimentation. our analysis has helped to correctly assemble the sequences at loci  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in rahman.

genotyping using sine sequences
we explored the possibility of using some of the polymorphic loci as markers for genotyping. for this we focused on loci  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and tested them using  <dig> axenic and xenic strains of e. histolytica. a genotyping method would need to be used for patient samples, where large amplicons may be difficult to obtain reproducibly due to impurities in dna preparation and low e. histolytica dna concentrations. we therefore designed primers as close to the ehsine <dig> insertion site as possible to minimize amplicon size . for each locus two primer sets were used; one set was designed from flanking sequences and the other set comprised one of the flanking primers combined with a primer from the ehsine <dig> sequence . although care was taken to design primers for each locus that did not match the entamoeba dispar genome, this was not possible in all cases due to extensive sequence conservation between the two species. however one primer from each pair for all three loci had no match in e. dispar . the amplicons obtained with each of the primer pairs for a given locus were combined and electrophoresed together in the same gel lane . the identities of the bands were confirmed by southern hybridization with a flanking region probe  or an ehsine <dig> probe . dna from strains hm-1:imss and rahman gave the expected amplicon with each primer pair, except for the  <dig>  kb band with primers  <dig>  f and  <dig>  r expected from hm-1:imss, which could not be amplified efficiently. hence hm-1:imss locus  <dig> was identified by the  <dig>  kb  <dig>  f/sine r product. results with the seven axenic strains showed that ehsine <dig> was present at all three loci in strains ms84- <dig> and ms27- <dig>  in this respect they behaved like hm-1:imss. however, primer set  <dig>  f- <dig> . <dig> r could not amplify ms <dig> and primer set  <dig>  r-sine r could not amplify ms <dig>  indicating that they were not identical to hm-1:imss at locus  <dig>  single nucleotide mutations in the flanking sequences could lead to sequence polymorphisms in these regions and give the observed result due to loss of primer recognition. since the sequence of this region is not known in these other strains, an explanation for this result would have to await further sequence data. similarly, strain hk- <dig> resembled rahman at all three loci in terms of ehsine <dig> occupancy but belonged to a third category since at locus  <dig> it repeatedly failed to give the expected amplicon size with primer pair  <dig>  f- <dig> r although the expected amplicon was obtained with primer pair  <dig>  f- <dig> r . strains pvbm08b and pvbm08f were like rahman at locus  <dig> and like hm-1:imss at loci  <dig> and  <dig>  strain ms96- <dig> was like rahman at loci  <dig> and  <dig>  however, genome sequence analysis  showed the presence of a 397 bp sine sequence  at locus  <dig> in this strain. since the pcr and southern data for this locus were unambiguous we are inclined to believe that, as mentioned earlier , the discrepancy between our data and amoebadb may be due to sequence assembly problems. strain 200:nih was like rahman at loci  <dig> and  <dig>  thus, based on the presence and absence of sine <dig>  and the amplicons obtained with each primer pair at these three loci, the axenic strains could be divided into five genotypes .

axenic strains  and xenic cultures  of e. histolytica were categorized into hm-1:imss /rahman /neither  type based on amplification patterns at loci  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  abbreviation used for axenic strains pvbm08b, ms96- <dig>  ms84- <dig>  ms27- <dig>  pvbm08f, 200:nih in the figures as pvb, ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  pvf and nih respectively.

the same primer pairs were used for analysis of  <dig> clinical isolates of e. histolytica . the results are summarized in table  <dig>  the amplicons were clearly visible only after southern hybridization for most clinical isolates. the results clearly show mosaic patterns in the three loci, displaying characters of both hm-1:imss and rahman in many strains.

to sum up the above data, a total of  <dig> e. histolytica strains were used in this study, of which hm-1:imss contains ehsine <dig> at all three loci , while rahman lacks the element at all three loci . in the remaining  <dig> e. histolytica strains , ehsine <dig> was absent at loci  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains respectively. based on the presence/absence of ehsine <dig>  and amplicons obtained with the primer pairs at these three loci, the  <dig> strains were categorized into eleven genotypes . based on sine occupancy there can only be eight combinations at the three loci . additional variations  have come about due to alterations in flanking sequences leading to loss of primer recognition sites. in the  <dig> strains tested the most frequent combination was hhh  followed by hrr and hrh  and hnh, nrr, hnr and nnh . the use of multiple loci for strain identification is preferred  <cit>  as a single locus cannot differentiate all the strains. the results obtained by our method corroborated with the data from trna-strs. both methods distinguished the strains hm-1:imss, rahman, 200:nih and hk- <dig> from one another  <cit>  and gave the same pattern for strains pvb and pvf . thus our results suggest that in principle genomic distribution of sines can be used as a valid method for typing of e. histolytica strains.

although sines are mobile genetic elements, their mobilization in present-day e. histolytica is probably a very infrequent event. this can be inferred from the fact that most genomic copies of the ehline <dig> retrotransposon  are inactive. we have shown experimentally that the retrotransposition activity in these cells is very low or absent  <cit> . therefore the genomic location of sines in a given strain is stable enough to be used as a strain-specific signature.

bioinformatic analysis of ehsine <dig> copies
although a detailed bioinformatic analysis of ehsine <dig> has been published  <cit> , a similar analysis of ehsine <dig> has not been reported. therefore we decided to carry out an analysis of ehsine <dig> using the approach that has been described for ehsine <dig>  all sequences that displayed similarity of more than 70% with the consensus sequence and a length of more than 400 bp were extracted from the genome sequence of e. histolytica available at ncbi . these were analysed for internal repeats  by using tandem repeat finder  <cit> . some of the ehsine <dig> sequences also contained irs, as reported in ehsine <dig> . ehsine <dig> copies could be categorized into distinct classes based on number of irs . the class with three irs was the most common, followed by those with two, one and four irs, respectively . a single copy each of  <dig> and  <dig> ir-containing ehsine2s was also found. about half the ehsine <dig> copies either lacked an ir or contained only a fragment of one. we also found one copy each of ehsine2s that matched the length expected of copies with  <dig> ir and  <dig> ir, but in fact contained no ir at all. these observations are similar to ehsine <dig> where it was reported that 60% of the copies had either no ir or had the appropriate length for  <dig> ir but only one out of three irs was recognizable  <cit> .we analyzed the ir sequences of all ehsine <dig> copies and extracted  <dig> ir sequences; the majority were 20 bp in length except four, in which the ir was 13–14 bp. a common motif present in these ir sequences was identified by the online motif search tool, meme to be aatgaataacaatacacg/ctt/c.

as already mentioned, retrotransposition is accompanied by generation of tsds. newly retrotransposed copies are expected to be flanked by identical tsds, while over time these accumulate mutations, become shorter in length and are finally unrecognizable. therefore length of tsds may be a marker of age of sines  <cit> . we analyzed the tsds of all  <dig> ehsine <dig> copies, and could find tsd in  <dig> cases. the longest tsds  were found in elements with irs, while copies lacking intact irs displayed smaller tsds, in the range of 8–9 bp . this suggests that copies lacking ir may be older and may have suffered loss of ir sequences subsequent to retrotransposition. in the case of ehsine <dig>  the  <dig> ir-containing copies were reported to be the most recently transposed elements as they had longer tsds than the other copies  <cit> . the tsds of  <dig> ehsine <dig> sites  were analyzed by meme. all  <dig> tsds showed the consensus motif tttnt, suggesting a high percentage of pyrimidines is needed at the insertion point.

CONCLUSIONS
sine elements are useful genomic markers due to their wide occurrence and property of irreversible re-integration in the host genome  <cit> . the loss of sines from genomic loci is a rare event and is generally accompanied by changes in flanking sequences as well  <cit> . therefore, as stated earlier, sines are better suited to establish genealogies below the species level with minimal assumptions compared with other standard markers, such as microsatellites, rflps, and snps, which can result from independent mutations at different times that are not inherited from a common ancestor  <cit> . for this reason the analysis of sine occupancy in e. histolytica strains reported here will be significant to establish intraspecific relationships.

retrotransposons are known to influence the expression of genes in their vicinity by various mechanisms, including silencing by heterochromatinization, up-regulation by providing alternate promoters, and novel expression patterns through alternative splicing and polyadenylation  <cit> . thus the gain or loss of ehsine <dig> element from a genomic locus could potentially influence the phenotype of the organism in a profound manner. for this reason the strain typing method used here has a potential to reveal loci that may be associated with different phenotypes, including the virulence properties of the parasite. however more samples need to be tested to provide a correlation between virulence and genotype. a combination of rapid genome sequencing and expression analysis from a variety of clinical isolates of e. histolytica by ngs will reveal whether retrotransposons in e. histolytica have the ability to influence neighboring gene expression. this method of strain typing based on retrotransposon occupancy could then have physiological relevance.
