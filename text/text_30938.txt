BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most dangerous human bacterial pathogens, causing a potentially deadly disease that has been around for a long time.  <cit> . despite of an optimistic report that tuberculosis and aids death rates are steadily declining around the world over recent several years  <cit> , they remain the main killers. moreover, hiv patients are much more vulnerable to tuberculosis and often become carriers for other non-tuberculous mycobacterial pathogens, such as m. avium  <cit> , m. kansasii  <cit> , m. abscessus  <cit> , m. timonense  <cit>  and m. genavense  <cit> . in the future these new pathogens may undergo the same evolutionary process of pathogenicity formation that was assumed for m. tuberculosis  <cit> . according to this hypothesis the evolution has started with an expansion phase involving active horizontal acquisition of virulence factors and gene duplication.

in the work by reva & bezuidt  <cit>  a new channel of transfer of virulence genes from pathogenic enterobacteria to brucella, mycobacterium and nocardia was reported, which may pose a serious impact on emergence of new pathogens. genomic islands found in mycobacterium were most likely originated from alpha-proteobacteria  <cit>  and gamma-proteobacteria  <cit> . an unexpectedly high frequency of mercury-resistant strains showing also an increased tolerance to gentamicin, streptomycin and d-cycloserine has been reported among the clinical non-tuberculous mycobacteria isolates of species m. avium, m. intracellulare and m. scrofulaceum  <cit> . the genome of a fish pathogen m. marinum, which sometimes causes opportunistic infections in humans, comprises a  <dig> kb mercury-resistance plasmid pmm <dig>  blastn and oligonucleotide composition comparison showed that this plasmid comprising a mercury resistance operon had originated from either nocardia or pseudonocardia  <cit> . it looked like that this plasmid has been acquired by m. marinum quite recently as it still shows a strong sequence and oligonucleotide pattern similarities to nocardia. these newly acquired genes may be behind the increased drug resistance reported for m. marinu isolates  <cit> . mercury resistance plasmid similar to that of m. marinum together with multiple gis of pseudomonas and actinobacteria origin were identified in m. abscessus, a pseudotuberculous lung disease causing microbe  <cit> ; and in a frog pathogen m. ulcerans, which sometimes cause skin ulcers in human  <cit> .

in this work we analysed acquired genes and patterns of distribution of genomic islands in available genomes of mycobacteria by comparing complete genome sequences and sequences of genomic islands previously identified in these organisms. the aim was to study the possibility of emergence of new mycobacterial pathogens in result of acquiring of virulence genomic islands.

RESULTS
comparison of  <dig> mycobacterial genomes  revealed  <dig>  clusters of orthologous genes  shared by all these organisms. concatenated alignment of these proteins was  <dig>  amino acid residues long. a species tree inferred from the concatenated alignment is shown in figure  <dig> 

* these genomic islands were excluded from this study.

 <dig> genomic islands identified in  <dig> genomes  comprised  <dig>  genes, which formed  <dig>  cogs. a binary data table representing the presence and absence of orthologous accessory genes associated with different genomic islands was created for inferring a parsimony tree shown in figure  <dig> 

in the tree in figure  <dig> the clusters represent groups of organisms, which share the same pool of interchangeable mobile genetic elements. species of the m. tuberculosis group were clustered separately from other mycobacteria in both trees in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  finding of genomic islands in these micro-organisms contributed to the hypothesis by veyrier et al.  <cit>  that the pathogen evolution might be triggered out by the acquisition of horizontally transferred genes. however, all genomic islands in m. tuberculosis most likely are ancient acquisitions. the identification of relative time of insertion is grounded in the assumption that the process of amelioration alters the island nucleotide composition from the time of insertion to reconcile with that of the host in which it occurs  <cit> . in an interactive web-based network of genomic islands prepared for our previous publication  <cit>  the relative age of acquisition is depicted by grey gradient where the darker colour means recent acquisitions and lighter colours indicates ancient islands.

in total  <dig> genes were found which were associated exclusively with these genomic islands of the mtb cluster and which were not present in genomic islands of other mycobacteria. among them there were argfghr arginine biosynthesis operon; pe-pgrs family genes; lpqd lipoprotein; idsb and grcc <dig> genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis; mscl osmotic pressure regulator; moab <dig> stress response regulator and several hypotheticals.

another group of micro-organisms clustered around m. marinum comprised phylogenetically related m. ulcerans and more distant m. abscessus and m. smegmatis. hypothesis of sharing of common mobile genetic elements by these bacteria is supported by the fact that m. marinum, m. ulcerans and m. abscessus genomes contained almost identical plasmids with several virulence genes  <cit> . there were  <dig> hypothetical genes , which were unique for the genomic islands of this group of micro-organisms. the third group clustered around m. vanbaalenii consisted of multiple environmental mycobacteria. they shared  <dig> hypothetical genes unique for this group.

the strain m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was located apart from other groups  and far away on the tree from its closest relative m. avium  <dig> . presence of multiple genomic islands in m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was confirmed by alternative genomic island prediction methods, as it was shown in pre_gi database. genetic content of the genomic islands and their ontological links to genomic islands from other micro-organisms were summarized in additional file  <dig> supplementary table s <dig> 

from additional file  <dig> table s <dig> it was seen that the genomic islands of m. avium k- <dig> shared sequences with those from m. avium  <dig>  but according to figure  <dig> the genetic content is rather different. several genomic islands showed sequence similarity to rather distant genomic islands from mycobacterium canettii and alicycliphilus denitrificans. m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis is a causative agent of johne's disease in cattle and other ruminants  <cit> . the non-paratuberculosis strain m. avium  <dig> also was isolated from an adult aids patient, but this micro-organism was considered as an opportunist rather than an established pathogen  <cit> . it looks that the horizontal gene transfer was the driving force of evolution of the paratuberculosis lineage of m. avium, as regarding to other proteins both these subspecies are very much similar .

an interesting finding was that all these mycobacterial genomes possessed several common genes present in all species, which nevertheless were associated with horizontally transferred mobile genetic elements. these genes were fadd22-fade, which are important for virulence and mycobactin synthesis  <cit> , and also the o-succinylbenzoic acid-coa ligase mene involved in menaquinone biosynthesis and considered as a potential target for antibiotics  <cit> . to ensure that these genes were associated with the horizontal gene transfer and were not falsely predicted due to some peculiarities in their sequences, a tree was constructed based on an alignment of the fadd <dig> proteins .

a combination of high level variability of fadd <dig> across mycobacteria with its conservation within taxonomic units indicates crucial importance of this protein for bacteria. fadd <dig> proteins showed much higher conservation in m. tuberculosis and m. leprae than that observed for other orthologous proteins  implying an indispensability of this protein for the pathogenesis. fadd <dig> of m. marinum also belonged to the mtb group despite that this organism phylogenetically is quite distant from m. tuberculosis. two strains of m. avium k- <dig> and  <dig> were separated in the fadd <dig> tree the same like in the genomic island gene tree . in m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis k- <dig> this protein was similar to that from the pathogenic strain m. abscessus, while in m. avium  <dig> the protein fadd <dig> was similar to orthologs in environmental strains. in general the topology of the fadd <dig> tree was not exactly congruent to either the species tree  or the accessory gene tree . it implies existing of a complex network of gene exchange between mycobacteria. two reticulate networks were designed by using the program splitstree: the first was based on incongruences of  <dig>  individual core cog alignments ; and the second was based on the matrix of shared  <dig>  cogs of horizontally transferred genes .

the network of core genes  showed that the species of mycobacterium were quite isolated from each other and the individual gene trees in most cases were congruent to the species tree shown in figure  <dig>  exceptions were m. marinum clustered with m. ulcerans in one case, and m. vanbaalenii clustered with mycobacterium sp. spyr <dig> in another case, which apparently have exchanged the core genes frequently. the turnover of genomic islands, which usually is associated with sharing the same pool of mobile genetic vectors such as conjugative plasmids and phages, was more intensive than the core gene exchange, especially between environmental m. vanbaalenii and mycobacterium sp. surprisingly, another common pool of mobile genes was shared by conditionally pathogenic m. abscessus and m. ulcerans with saprophytic soil m. smegmatis and mycobacterium sp. jdm <dig>  although bacteria of the m. tuberculosis group were believed to be resistant to horizontal gene transfer and comprised only ancient genomic islands  <cit> , it was still possible to root them to the common pool of mycobacterial horizontally transferred genes. contrary, m. avium and m. marinum genomes were placed apart in the reticulate network. the reason for this might be that they acquired genes from different sources including those which were not common to other mycobacteria .

CONCLUSIONS
veyrier et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that m. tuberculosis had undergone a biphasic evolutionary process involving genome expansion  and reductive evolution . nowadays the evolution of this pathogen including the development of drug resistance fully relies on selective mutations, genome recombination and gene duplication  <cit> , but the evolution towards pathogenicity initially might be triggered by an acquisition of several virulence factors  <cit> . over the recent decades the humankind has witnessed a drastic emergence of outbreaks of new pathogens. a question of an acute medicinal importance is where, when and which pathogens may cause new outbreaks in the near future? drawing the strongest attention to control on m. tuberculosis, we have not to forget that other non-tuberculosis mycobacteria have a potential to put humankind under risk of new invasions. this is why it is very important to study in detail the development of pathogenicity of m. tuberculosis so that an emergence of new mycobacterial pathogens will not catch us unaware.

genomic islands found in mycobacteria share dna composition and sequence similarities with a big group of genomic islands originated from actinobacteria, alpha-, beta- and gamma-proteobacteria, deinococcus/thermus and some other bacteria  <cit>  . in the same paper it was shown that the genomic islands of m. tuberculosis most likely have originated from alpha-proteobacterial intracellular parasites and symbionts of agrobacterium, rhizobium and brucella genera. an activation of genetic vectors of this group was reported and it was hypothesized that it might be resulted from up-growing ocean water pollution with heavy metal ions and other industrial pollutants  <cit> . according to bezuidt et al.  <cit> , the recent outbreak of the enterohemorrhagic e. coli o104:h <dig> in  <dig> was associated with an activation of this pool of mobile virulence genes. the same virulence vectors may affect in future the environmental and conditionally pathogenic mycobacteria. potentially the most risky species in this regard are m. marinum  and m. avium ssp. paratuberculosis  as i) they were promiscuous in acquiring mobile genetic elements from different sources including taxonomically distant organisms; and ii) m. marinum might actively exchange genes with other environmental and conditionally pathogenic species of mycobacterium. the latter capability is potentially dangerous as the exchange of readily available virulence genes between compatible potentially pathogenic bacteria may lead to spontaneous stochastic outbreaks of new diseases.
