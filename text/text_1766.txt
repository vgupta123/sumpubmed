BACKGROUND
adherence to host tissues is an essential and complex stage of bacterial colonization preceding the establishment of a bacterial infection. therefore analysis of surface exposed proteins is a very important step in providing more information about the mechanisms of adhesion, colonization and invasion of host tissues as well as of the ability of the organism to evade the host immune system.

a large number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria use fimbriae and pili for bacterial attachment  <cit> . in mycoplasmas, which belong to the class of mollicutes characterized by the lack of a cell wall, fimbrial structures are missing. hence, mycoplasmal membrane proteins exposed to the external environment mediate direct binding of the bacteria to host cells. surface exposed structures like lipids  <cit> , membrane proteins  <cit>  and lipoproteins  <cit>  must be considered as potential cytoadherence factors.

mycoplasma hominis is a facultative pathogen of the human urogenital tract. in silico analysis of the m. hominis genome led to an annotation of  <dig> proteins. the minimal set of  <dig> proteins postulated to be essential for survival of this mycoplasma species  <cit>  includes the cytoadhesive lipoproteins p <dig>  also known as variable adherence associated antigen  <cit> , p <dig>  a domain of a membrane complex  <cit> , and oppa, the substrate-binding domain of the oligopeptide permease  <cit> . over the past years oppa of m. hominis has been characterized as a multifunctional protein, the functions of which include:  <dig>  the substrate-binding domain of the oligopeptide permease  <cit> ;  <dig>  it acts as an immunogenic cytoadhesin, whose binding to hela cells is inhibited in the presence of the monoclonal antibody bg <dig>  <cit> ; and  <dig>  it represents the main mg2+-dependent ecto-atpase which is a unique feature of m. hominis in contrast to oppa proteins of other mollicutes  <cit> . using in vitro infection assays the pathophysiological role of oppa has become obvious as its ecto-atpase activity was shown to induce atp release from hela cells and their subsequent death  <cit> .

based on the sequence characteristics of this atpase domain, oppa belongs to the class of p-loop ntpases whose nucleotide binding fold is composed of a conserved walker a motif  and a less conserved walker b motif. these are both generally found in the cytoplasmic atp-hydrolyzing domains of abc-transporters as motors for transport  <cit> . the atpase domain of oppa is remarkable in that the order of walker a and b on the polypeptide chain is inverted to walker b and a. to date this orientation has only been found in the atpase binding fold of myosin in rabbits and nematodes  <cit> . with regard to other p-loop ntpases, oppa of m. hominis is the only one localized on the surface  <cit> . in other pro- and eukaryotic ecto-ntpases, the p-loop structure is missing and in these instances nucleotide binding is mediated by a different structure characterized by conserved acr-regions first described in apyrase  <cit> . despite structural differences in the catalytic domains, common features with oppa include their extracellular localization, the ability to hydrolyze atp with a high turnover , and their dependence on divalent cations.

to date mammalian ecto-atpases have been shown to be involved in several cell functions:  <dig>  protection from the cytolytic effect of extra-cellular atp  <cit> ,  <dig>  regulation of ecto-kinases by modulation of atp-content as a substrate  <cit> ,  <dig>  involvement in signal transduction  <cit> , and  <dig>  cellular adhesion  <cit> . in parasites like trypanosoma cruzi it has been shown that an enhanced expression in ecto-atpase activity leads to a concomitant increase in adhesion to macrophages whereas its inhibition abrogates adhesion and internalisation by these host cells  <cit> .

in the present work the relationship of the two oppa-functions, atpase activity and cytoadherence, was analyzed. we show that the cytoadhesion of m. hominis is dependent on the ecto-atpase activity of oppa and that this could be assigned to distinct regions of the protein.

RESULTS
generation of recombinant oppa mutants modified in putative functional sites
to dissect which regions of the oppa polypeptide chain might determine adhesion and its atpase activity, recombinant oppa mutants were constructed .

in the search for conserved sequence motifs in oppa proteins of different species, three regions with high homologies were detected: the region of aa <dig> - aa <dig>  which is conserved in bacterial oppa proteins, thus named cs <dig> , and regions cs <dig>  and cs <dig> , which are conserved in mycoplasmal oppa proteins. to determine the functions of these regions, oppa mutants, oppaΔcs <dig>  oppaΔcs <dig> and oppaΔcs <dig> were constructed .

with regard to the atpase activity of oppa we analyzed five mutants. in  <dig> two oppa mutants, oppak875r  and oppaΔp-loop  had already been characterized. they were modified to different extent within the walker a region  leading to a decreased atpase activity to 15%  and 6%  in relation to the wild type  <cit> . as computer analysis revealed a putative walker a motif  in the oppa protein of m. pulmonis , we constructed a third walker a mutant  by replacing the original walker a region of m. hominis with the putative walker a sequence. interestingly this putative walker a motif of m. pulmonis oppa is located within the cs <dig> region. in the fourth oppa mutant, oppaΔwb the less conserved walker b motif plus a downstream region of several hydrophobic amino acids was deleted . in the oppan mutant the c-terminal half of oppa  was deleted thus missing the cs <dig>  walker b and walker a motif. all oppa mutants were expressed in e. coli with an n-terminal histidine-tag instead of the  <dig> aa signal peptide; including the cysteine residue where signal peptidase ii cleavage and lipid modification would normally take place in m. hominis. after purification the quality of the oppa mutants and wild type membrane proteins used in the following analyses was documented by sds- page. dephosphorylation of oppa was demonstrated by proq staining .

atpase activity of the oppa mutants
first the kinetics of atp hydrolysis of the different oppa mutants was analyzed by measuring the release of free phosphate . the addition of mgatp to the oppa mutants led to an increase in atpase activity in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. the data of atp hydrolysis were fed into michaelis-menten equation. in nonlinear regression analysis the michaelis constant, km for the recombinant oppar was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm atp, whereas km for the wild type oppawt was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm. as the michaelis constant behaves reciprocally to the enzyme affinity this exhibits a higher affinity of oppawt for atp than oppar. this may be due to a partial misfolding of the recombinant variant. however, the maximum reaction rate  was similar for both proteins.

as shown in figure 2a. <dig> dephosphorylation of oppa had no influence on its atpase activity  whereas mutations within either the walker a or walker b motifs led to a dramatic decrease in atp-hydrolysis. as previously shown in  <dig>  <cit>  a single point mutation in the walker a motif  led to a decreased atp-hydrolysis by oppawa <dig> to 15% whereas atp-binding still occurred. mutation of the whole walker a motif in oppawa <dig> resulted in the complete inhibition of both atp-binding and hydrolysis. exchanging the walker a motif of m. hominis with the putative walker a sequence of m. pulmonis in oppawa <dig> also led to inhibition of the atp-hydrolysis indicating that the walker a motif of m. pulmonis in this context is non-functional. as expected both the oppa-mutant lacking the walker b motif  as well as the oppan -mutant with a complete deletion of the c- terminal half of oppa, including the atp-binding domain, did not show any atpase activity .

next we examined the contribution of the other conserved regions on the catalytic function of oppa. deletion of the cs <dig> region  led to an increased km in the oppaΔcs2mutant  . with regard to the oppaΔcs <dig> and oppaΔcs <dig> mutants the lowest affinity for atp was observed for the oppaΔcs <dig> mutant , demonstrating a significant participation of the cs <dig> region in conformation of the neighbored walker ba region.

these data provide evidence that in addition to the walker a and b motif the conserved regions cs <dig>  cs <dig>  and cs <dig> affect atpase activity  and suggest that these regions are involved in stabilizing the catalytic atpase domain of oppa.

atpase domain of oppa mediates cytoadherence
participation of the well characterized membrane proteins p <dig>  p60/p <dig> and oppa  in cytoadherence of mycoplasma hominis had previously been demonstrated by comparing the binding capacity of the purified proteins to immobilized hela cells with cytoadherence of m. hominis cells  <cit> . the cell elisa was used to scrutinize the oppa binding more closely in which the membrane proteins p <dig>  p60/p <dig> and oppa served as positive controls. as shown in figure 2a. <dig>  the membrane proteins attached to hela cells in a dose-dependent manner. nonlinear regression and one-site binding analyses were performed to estimate the apparent dissociation constants for p <dig> , p60/p <dig> , oppa  and dephosphorylated oppaΔpi-variant . deletion of the cs <dig> region  reduced adhesion of the oppar to 70%  whereas deletion of either the cs <dig> region  or the c-terminal half of oppa  led to a decrease in adherence to 35% and 25%, respectively, suggesting a high impact of the walker ba region on cytoadhesion. this was affirmed by analysis of the other walker ba mutants of oppa . as mutations of the walker a motif in oppawa <dig> and oppawa <dig> inhibited binding of oppa to 9% and 8%, respectively, the p-loop structure was demonstrated as an essential part for oppa-adhesion . these findings are summarized in figure  <dig> depicting the atpase activity and the adhesive regions of the respective oppa mutant in relation to oppa and suggest that the presence and interaction of the n-terminal localized cs <dig> region with the catalytic site of the atpase domain  take part in oppa's attachment of hela cells.

oppa adherence depends mainly on atp-hydrolysis
to ascertain whether binding of oppa depends not only on a conserved atpase domain architecture but in fact on atp hydrolysis, oppa binding to hela cells was characterized in the presence of dids , an inhibitor of ecto- atpases; suramin, an inhibitor of ca2+-atpases; oligomycin, an inhibitor of f1-atpases; and ouabain, an inhibitor of na+/k+-dependent atpases.

oppa was neither able to hydrolyze atp  nor to attach to hela cells in the presence of dids and suramin . this is in accordance with the findings that even cytoadherence of m. hominis to living hela cells was abolished by dids and suramin  <cit> . as expected oligomycin, an inhibitor of f1-atpases, and ouabain, an inhibitor of atpases dependant on monovalent cations, had neither an effect on atpase activity of oppa nor on its adhesion to hela cells. predictably, adherence of the m. hominis p60/p <dig> membrane protein complex lacking an atpase activity remained unaffected by these inhibitors .

to test the hypothesis that attachment of oppa is an energy-consuming step provided by atpase hydrolysis we added fsba , a non-hydrolyzing adenosine, to the adhesion assay. atp hydrolysis as well as adhesion of oppa to hela cells were competitively reduced in a dose-dependent manner to approximately 30% showing that atp hydrolysis is essential for adhesion of oppa . moreover, oppa adherence to vital hela-cells decreased in the presence of atp in concentrations of  <dig> - <dig>  mm whereas concentrations up to  <dig> mm mgatp inhibited adherence of oppa to hela.

discussion
with the observation that in the cell-wall less, facultative human-pathogen mycoplasma hominis, oppa is a multifunctional lipoprotein involved in cytoadhesion, nutrition uptake and ecto-atpase-mediated damage of the host cell, we started to map the cytoadhesive regions in relation to the atpase domain on the polypeptide chain. utilizing recombinant oppa mutants we observed that ecto-atpase activity and adherence to hela cells are inter-dependent functions of oppa. both functions are mainly influenced by the walker a motif, supported by the walker b motif and the upstream cs <dig> region for maximal atpase activity, and maintained by the cs <dig> and cs <dig> regions in terms of adherence. these findings suggest an interaction or juxtaposition of these regions in the three-dimensional structure of the molecule, important for atpase activity and attachment to the host, and clearly demonstrate that the oppa-mediated cytoadherence depends on autologous atp-hydrolysis.

bacterial oppa proteins usually function solely as substrate-binding domains of oligopeptide permeases. oligopeptide importers  belong to the class of atp-binding-cassette-  transporters with two pore-forming domains  and two cytoplasmic atpases   <cit> . the cytoplasmic atpase domains function as motors for substrate transport across the membrane using atp as fuel. it seems to be a freak of nature that in m. hominis, oppa has gained an additional atpase activity which raises the question as to its function. to date ecto-atpase activity of oppa is unique to m. hominis among substrate-binding proteins of abc-transporters of all three kingdoms. thus it seems illogical that the ecto-atpase is required for optimized peptide import. the findings of this study clearly demonstrate that the oppa ecto-atpase is essential for maximal cytoadhesion of m. hominis. in studying bacterial adhesion to polymer surfaces stollenwerk and coworkers found that under conditions of starvation - by incubation in nutrient-poor buffer - the atp content of adherent bacteria decreased after  <dig> h to  <dig> h whereas that of planktonic bacteria remained stable for up to  <dig> days  <cit> . this suggests that cytoadhesion is an energy-consuming process. similar to our results presented here an ecto-atpase-dependent cytoadherence has already been suggested for trypanosoma cruzi whose atpase activity was strongly inhibited by using dids or suramin attended by a reduced adhesion to mouse resident macrophages  <cit> . early work of bredt and coworkers in the 1980's demonstrated that cytoadhesion of the cell wall-less mollicutes is modulated by atp. by monitoring the atp content in the supernatant attachment of m. pneumoniae to glass surfaces was shown to depend on an intact energy metabolism  <cit> . in using a glucose-inhibitor, the atp content declined and attachment was abrogated. in using an atpase inhibitor, atp content accumulates leading to a decreased cytoadherence. bredt and coworkers hypothesized that the first step of colonization is energy dependent either to energize the membrane thus increasing some binding sites on the surface, or to modulate the contractile cytoskeleton  <cit> . the free energy of atp hydrolysis by p-loop ntpases is typically utilized to introduce conformational changes in other molecules  <cit> .

as adhesion of mycoplasmal cytoadhesins does not depend on atp-hydrolysis at all, as demonstrated in this study for the p60/p <dig> membrane complex of m. hominis, atpase dependent adhesion of oppa is predicted to play a special role in m. hominis. in  <dig> oppa was shown to mediate apoptosis, to induce atp-efflux and a concomitant atp-depletion of the m. hominis-colonized host cell  <cit> . this is in accordance to the recent findings that the cytoadherence of m. pneumoniae induces an atp-efflux from the colonized host  <cit> . atp- efflux was considered as a stress-associated danger signal as it stimulates p2x7-receptors of the host leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. it is well known that extracellular atp signals through p <dig> receptors to modulate the immune and inflammatory response in a variety of host cells, including immune and non-immune cells, sometimes leading to apoptosis or necrosis of the cells  <cit> . zhang and lo demonstrated in  <dig> that the principally invasive pathogens m. fermentans and m. penetrans prevent apoptosis and stimulate host cell growth of infected cells whereas the predominantly surface-colonizing species m. hominis and m. salivarium promote apoptosis  <cit> . inhibition of p2x7-signaling appears to be more important for intracellular pathogens as shown by the treatment of m. tuberculosis infected macrophages with atp, which results in killing of both the intracellular mycobacteria and the host, whereas conditions such as complement-mediated cytolysis, fas ligation, and cd <dig> activation induced only lysis of the macrophages while preserving the bacterial vitality  <cit> .

with regard to the findings that m. hominis, a well known colonizer of epithelial surfaces, has also been found in the intracellular compartment in cultured hela cells  <cit> , trichomonas vaginalis  <cit>  and human spermatozoa  <cit> , oppa-mediated cytoadhesion of m. hominis may play a key role in invasion. in case of infection the extracellular atp-level is increased. thus, an oppa-mediated decrease of this danger signal, thus preventing p2x <dig> - mediated signaling, with concomitant cytoadhesion are proposed mechanisms for mycoplasma survival to circumvent host immune defense mechanisms and facilitate invasion.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that the enzymatic function of oppa as main ecto-atpase of m. hominis is essential for adhesion and suggests that the unique feature of this mycoplasma has an impact on patho-physiological important processes in host-pathogen interactions.
