BACKGROUND
abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and extreme temperature negatively impact the growth and productivity of crop plants  <cit> . among these various stresses, drought is the primary factor causing crops to lose productivity  <cit> . the impacts of drought are likely to become even more pronounced as desertification and global climate change progress around the world. plants have evolved a diverse set of morphological, biochemical, physiological and molecular adaptations to both survive and sustain growth in harsh environments  <cit> . understanding drought response mechanisms is essential to improving drought tolerance and reducing the influence of drought on plant growth and crop yield.

stress-associated genes and proteins for each of the steps downstream of the drought response can be grouped into two major categories: single functional genes and transcription factors   <cit> . tfs are critical regulators of the changes in gene expression used to respond to environmental stress  <cit> . a single tf can control the expression of many downstream genes by binding to the cis-acting element in the promoters of the target genes  <cit> . current efforts to improve plant stress tolerances by the genetic transformation of tf genes have resulted in several important achievements. the dreb  gene family broadly participates in plant stress response pathways  <cit> . the dreb <dig> gene family is particularly important in the responses to dehydration and heat stress  <cit> .

dreb homologs have been identified in a wide variety of plants, including grasses  <cit> , fruits  <cit> , vegetables  <cit> , crops  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . over the past decade, many reports, both in the laboratory and the field, have demonstrated that drebs hold great potential for improving the stress tolerance of plants in response to drought, salt, cold, and heat  <cit> . consequently, dreb genes are promising candidates for genetic engineering and have been extensively investigated in recent years. characterization of dreb/erf genes from wild species  may provide novel homologues for breeding stress resistance into crops  <cit> . although primarily cloned from herbaceous plants, dreb homologues have been characterized in woody, desert plants such as populus euphratica <cit>  and caragana korshinskii <cit> . analysis of naturally stress-tolerant plants proffers novel stress-associated gene resources and may enhance our knowledge of dreb expression and function.

eremosparton songoricum  vass. is a leafless perennial dwarf shrub endemic to central asia  <cit> . e. songoricum is adapted to a harsh desert environment and is a wild pioneer species used to protect the local ecosystem from desertification in the gurbantunggut desert of xinjiang. this extremely drought-tolerant leguminous shrub is being developed as a model organism for investigating the morphological, biochemical, physiological and molecular adaptations to a desert environment  <cit> . we report here the cloning of a drought-induced dreb gene from e. songoricum . we have characterized esdreb2b gene expression, subcellular localization, and transactivation activity. in addition, we have investigated the function of esdreb2b in transgenic yeast and tobacco and evaluated transgenic plant tolerance to a suite of abiotic stresses.

RESULTS
characterization of esdreb2b from e. songoricum
a cdna clone encoding a dreb <dig> protein was isolated from two-week-old e. songoricum seedlings exposed to 20%  peg for 12 h. for clarity and in keeping with the nomenclature established for this gene family in other plants, we have designated the gene esdreb2b and the encoded protein esdreb2b. esdreb2b  was 757 bp in length and contained a single, continuous open reading frame . the orf encoded a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 22 kda and a predicted pi of  <dig> . the deduced e. songoricum polypeptide has significant sequence identity to the conserved ap2/erf dna-binding domain  <cit>  and is more than 80% identical to cap <dig> from chickpea  <cit>  . significant amino acid sequence similarity is also seen with dreb2b deduced polypeptides from soybean , rice  and arabidopsis . alignment of the ap2/erf dna-binding domain demonstrates that esdreb2b contains the conserved valine  and glutamic acid  residues observed in other dreb predicted polypeptides   <cit> . comparison of the pairwise alignments was conducted using clustalx  <dig> . to determine the architecture of the esdreb2b gene, e. songoricum g dna was amplified using cdna-specific primers. esdreb2b is an intron-less gene similar to dreb genes reported for salicornia brachiate   <cit> , chickpea   <cit>  and soybean   <cit> .

esdreb2b is a member of the ap2/erf protein family and belongs to the “group iv, a-2” sub-group  <cit> . other members of this sub-group include cap <dig>  <cit> , gmdreb2b  <cit> , osdreb2b  <cit>  and atdreb2a  <cit> . deduced polypeptides of this sub-group each contain single copy of the motifs cmiv- <dig>  cmiv- <dig> and ap <dig>  and may contain a single copy of cmiv- <dig> . cmiv- <dig> is  <dig> amino acid residues and defined by the conserved amino acid motif gkggpxn. cmiv- <dig> is  <dig> amino acids residues, and cmiv- <dig> is  <dig> amino acids residues. cmiv- <dig> and cmiv- <dig> are predicted to contain a nuclear localization sequence   <cit> . esdreb2b contains a newly identified motif cmiv- <dig> . the entire predicted polypeptide esdreb2b was aligned and compared to  <dig> dreb <dig> sequences including atdreb2a and osdreb2a . phylogenetic analysis shows a well-supported group of dreb <dig> sequences derived from leguminous plants  including esdreb2b, cap <dig> and gmdreb2b. additionally, the fabaceae group contains two well-supported subgroups designated “legume 2b” and “legume 2c”. similar gene tree architectures were obtained using only the ap <dig> domain, and alternate analytical models for tree construction .

these legume-specific deduced polypeptide sequences contain canonical dreb <dig> motifs including the ap <dig> domain and the cmiv- <dig> and cmiv- <dig> motifs  <cit> ; however, the legume-specific orfs are truncated  relative to sequences derived from soybean  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , lack cmiv- <dig> and contain a novel motif cmiv- <dig> . cmiv- <dig> is  <dig> amino acid residues and defined by the conserved amino acid motif nsgdaxdmxxslslv. cmiv- <dig> is present in each of the truncated dreb <dig> sequences from legumes, and no other deduced polypeptide sequences in the databases share significant homology with this motif. esdreb2b and related sequences do not contain a negative regulatory domain   <cit> . the nrd is present in atdreb2a, atdreb2b and atdreb2c and gmdreb2a; <dig>  <cit> , and is located immediately downstream of the ap <dig> domain. deletion of the nrd in atdreb2a transforms the protein to a constitutively active form  <cit> .

analysis of esdreb2b expression by qrt-pcr in e. songoricum seedlings
quantitative rt-pcr  was employed to analyze the steady-state transcript accumulation of esdreb2b in e. songoricum seedlings . esdreb2b transcript was detectable in roots, stem and leaves of unstressed  seedlings, and was most abundant in leaves . esdreb2b transcript abundance was measured in plants exposed to osmotic stress , salinity , low temperature , exogenous aba , elevated temperature , oxidative stress  and heavy metal  . in response to each treatment, esdreb2b steady-state transcript amounts increased, reached a peak at either 6 h or 12 h and subsequently declined at 24 h . with the exception of exogenous aba exposure and cold stress, esdreb2b transcript was more abundant at 24 h relative to the control . esdreb2b steady-state transcript amounts increased more than 20-fold in response to elevated temperature . these results suggest that esdreb2b is widely involved in multiple stress responses, and may function in the aba-mediated stress tolerance pathway.

subcellular localization and transactivation analysis of esdreb2b protein
the ap2/erf family members function as transcription factors in plants and have been documented to localize to the nucleus of arabidopsis protoplasts  <cit>  and onion epidermal cells  <cit> . the subcellular location of the esdreb2b protein was analyzed by the transient expression of a gfp fusion protein introduced into onion epidermal cells . the control protein  was distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the onion cells, while the esdreb2b fusion protein  was only detectable in the nucleus . the transcriptional activation ability of esdreb2b was examined using the yeast one-hybrid assay. yeast cells transfected with the pbridge-bd vector acted as the negative control and were unable to grow on the sd medium without his and trp  . however, the cells harboring pbridge-bd-esdreb2b or pbridge-bd-gal <dig>  grew well on the sd/-his-trp medium , and these cells turned blue using the β-galactosidase activity assay . these results indicate that esdreb2b was targeted to the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity of a gal4-containing reporter gene. similar results have been obtained for cap <dig>  <cit>  and lcdreb  <cit> .

esdreb2b protein expression in transgenic yeast enhances tolerance to multiple stresses
dreb <dig> transcriptional factors have not been extensively studied in yeast . cap <dig> has been demonstrated to provide enhanced tolerance to elevated temperature  in yeast  <cit> . the esdreb2b cdna, driven by a galactose-inducible promoter , was introduced into s. cerevisiae  in order to investigate the ability of esdreb2b to enhance abiotic stress tolerance . semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis confirmed that esdreb2b was expressed in yeast with a peak expression level occurring at 36 h . subsequently, all yeast cells were evaluated after 36 h exposure to stress. the growth rate of esdreb2b-transformed s. cerevisiae  was similar to the growth rate of empty vector controls  under non-stress conditions . s. cerevisiae was able to grow in the presence of 30%  peg , 5 m nacl , at low temperature  or elevated temperature , or in the presence of 20 mm h2o <dig> . esdreb2b-transformed s. cerevisiae had dramatically enhanced growth relative to the control yeast in the presence of peg , nacl  and heat . these results indicated that esdreb2b was functional in yeast cells and improved the tolerance to peg-, salinity- and heat-stress.

evaluation of esdreb2b in transgenic tobacco in response to drought, salt, cold and heat
since esdreb2b transcript accumulation was up-regulated by a number of abiotic stresses  and enhanced the stress tolerance of yeast , transgenic nicotiana tobacco plants containing the esdreb2b cdna were generated to evaluate whether overexpression of the orf could enhance stress tolerance. hygromycin-resistant transgenic lines were confirmed by pcr and rt-pcr amplification using gene specific primers . l <dig> and l <dig> were two, randomly selected, independent transgenic lines that overexpressed esdreb2b. for osmotic- and salinity-stress, two-week-old seedlings were grown on ms medium and transplanted to ms medium supplemented with 200 mm mannitol or 200 mm nacl for  <dig> d. for low and elevated temperature-stress, two-week-old seedlings grown in ms medium, transplanted to ms medium and incubated for  <dig> d at 4°c or  <dig> d at 42°c, respectively. esdreb2b transgenic tobacco grew normally when un-stressed, and the non-transformed and transgenic lines showed no difference in the fresh weight under non-stress growth conditions . the fresh weight of wt plants was significantly lower in response to all four treatments . transgenic plants maintained significantly higher fresh weight in all four treatments. and with the exception of elevated temperature, the salt and cold-stress l <dig> transgenic fresh weight values were more similar to unstressed values. only the osmotic stressed l <dig> transgenic fresh weight was similar to the unstressed samples. after  <dig> d of mannitol treatment, dark green leaves with curled edges were observed in both the transgenic and wt plants . after  <dig> d of salt treatment, yellow leaves were observed on all of the plants. after  <dig> d of cold exposure, both wt and transgenic seedlings were slightly wilted. seedling growth was most affected by elevated temperature. after  <dig> d of heat exposure, both wt and transgenic lines had pale green cotyledons. only 17%  of the wt plants survived exposure to elevated temperature, while 92%  of the transgenic plants  survived exposure to elevated temperature.

improved root branching in esdreb2b transgenic plants in response to stress
dreb <dig> proteins such as cap <dig> and pgdreb2b have been found to enhanced stress tolerance through regulating root architecture   <cit> . we analyzed the root length and lateral root number , and leaf number  of wt and transgenic plants overexpressing esdreb2b under stress under non-stress  condition, there were no differences between wt and transgenic plants regarding root length and root number . root length in l <dig> transgenic plants was significantly higher in response to osmotic-stress . with the exception of l <dig> exposed to elevated temperature, all transgenic plants had significant more lateral roots in response to each of the four treatments , while leaf number was unchanged . these results indicated that overexpression of esdreb2b can enhance tolerance to osmotic-, salt- and temperature-stress.

esdreb2b transgenic plants were less damaged and accumulated higher levels of proline under stress
we monitored several plant stress responses at the physiological level . the mda, proline and chlorophyll contents did not significantly differ among the wt, l <dig> and l <dig> plant lines after  <dig> d of non-stress  growth . in response to all four treatments, l <dig> transgenic plants had significantly less damage as measured by mda content when compared with wt plants . with the exception of salinity-stress, l <dig> transgenic plants had the same response as l <dig> transgenic plants. transgenic plants also accumulated significantly more proline as compared to wt lines under all the stress conditions . these results indicated that overexpression of esdreb2b increases the amount of proline in response to osmotic-, salt- and temperature-stress. for chlorophyll content, significant differences between transgenic and wt plants were observed only in response to elevated temperature .

discussion
dre-binding  proteins are key components of abiotic stress tolerance in plants  <cit> . dreb2-type transcription factors respond to an array of stressors  and are documented to induce the expression of numerous, downstream, abiotic-stress related genes. due to their importance, dreb <dig> genes have been identified in a large number of plant species including soybean  <cit> , rice  <cit> , corn  <cit> , barley  <cit> , chickpea  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . we hypothesize that the identification and characterization of dreb2b homologues from plants adapted dry environments, such as e. songoricum, will provide unique insights to dreb function and gene control.

with few notable exceptions , dreb <dig> genes are induced by both dehydration and heat shock  <cit> . steady state transcript amounts of esdreb2b do not respond to environmental factors as a typical dreb2b gene. esdreb2b steady state transcript amounts are induced in response to all experimental treatments used in this study: osmotic stress, salinity, low temperature, exogenous aba, elevated temperature, oxidative stress, heavy metal and wounding. strong induction in response to dehydration, salinity and elevated temperature coupled with a lack of induction by low temperature is characteristic of atdreb2a, atdreb2b, osdreb2a and cap <dig> <cit> . esdreb2b, like gmdreb2a <cit> , zmdreb2a <cit>  and osdreb2b <cit> , exhibited strong induction in response to dehydration, salinity, elevated temperature and low temperature. interestingly, steady state transcript amounts of the legume-specific, truncated sequences esdreb2b, cap <dig> and gmdreb2b/c are induced by exogenous aba treatment  <cit> .

the esdreb2b deduced polypeptide sequence is a member of the ap2/erf protein family and most similar to deduced polypeptide sequences from chickpea   <cit>  and soybean   <cit> . the cmiv- <dig>  cmiv- <dig> and ap <dig> domains are found in all previously characterized dreb <dig>  deduced polypeptides suggesting conserved function of these domains. cmiv- <dig> and cmiv- <dig> have been characterized as nls motifs and ap <dig> has been determined to act as a dna-binding domain  <cit> . the most intensely studied dreb <dig> genes  contain a cmiv- <dig> domain in the carboxy-terminal region and the domain has been demonstrated to function as a strong transactivation domain  <cit> . the legume-specific, truncated dreb <dig> group  contains the cmiv- <dig> domain. in cap <dig>  the cmiv- <dig> domain has been shown to be required for heat tolerance in yeast and may play a critical role in the transactivation of these truncated proteins  <cit> . shorter dreb <dig> deduced polypeptides, such as atdreb2e, atdreb2h and osdreb2a lack both the cmiv- <dig> and cmiv- <dig> domains and are reported to either be non-responsive to stress or respond to stress without transactivation activity  <cit> .

based upon shared motifs and structural features, we have classified dreb2-type  deduced polypeptides proteins into three groups: 1) non-truncated deduced polypeptides that possess a cmiv- <dig> domain, 2) deduced polypeptides that lack both the cmiv- <dig> and cmiv- <dig> domains and 3) truncated  deduced polypeptides that share a unique cmiv- <dig> motif. group  <dig> dreb <dig> genes are reported to be significant stress response genes  <cit>  while group  <dig> dreb <dig> genes are not considered to play a key role in stress response  <cit> . these results suggest the possibility that the different groups of dreb2-type proteins with group-specific motifs may have different transactivation mechanisms, and may play different roles in plant stress response.

the ability of dreb <dig> homologues to enhance osmotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants has been extensively studied  <cit> . overexpression of atdreb2a-ca in transgenic arabidopsis results in greatly enhanced drought- and heat-stress tolerance, slightly enhanced freezing tolerance and no salt-tolerance  <cit> . similar results have been observed with transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing osdreb2b; <dig>  <cit> , zmdreb2a  <cit>  and gmdreb2a  <cit> . overexpression of cap <dig> in transgenic tobacco resulted in enhanced osmotic, salt- and heat-tolerance  <cit> ; with the exception of heat-stress tolerance, similar results have been observed with transgenic tobacco overexpressing pgdreb2a <cit>  and lcdreb <cit> . overexpression of esdreb2b in transgenic tobacco was demonstrated to enhance osmotic- and heat-stress tolerance and also enhance cold- and salt-stress tolerance.

unique among dreb2-type homologues, only esdreb2b and osdreb2b transcript amounts are strongly induced by dehydration, salt, low temperature, elevated temperature and exogenous aba. however, transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing osdreb2b have enhanced tolerance to drought- and heat-stress only. the legume-specific, truncated esdreb2b transcript is unique among dreb <dig> homologues in the breadth of transcriptional response and overexpression of the sequence in transgenic tobacco provides enhanced tolerance to osmotic-, salt-, cold- and heat-stress. further experiments are needed to characterize the mechanisms controlling the accumulation of esdreb2b transcript and to establish the downstream target promoters potentially regulated by this protein in response to a suite of abiotic stresses.

in dreb2b overexpressing transgenic plants , a common observation is reduced foliar growth as compared to control plants  <cit> . in sharp contrast, esdreb2b overexpressing transgenic tobacco demonstrated enhanced growth relative to non-transformed controls under stress conditions. esdreb2b transgenic plants also exhibited no morphological differences as compared to the non-transformed controls. root architecture and morphology is an important feature of plant growth and development  <cit> . esdreb2b transgenic tobacco plants had significantly increased numbers of lateral roots. it has been hypothesized that increasing primary root length  and/or increasing lateral root number  represent important adaptations to water-limiting environments  <cit> .

the ability to modify essential metabolic processes is key to adapting to adverse environmental conditions. the accumulation of proline is a common response to both biotic and abiotic stress in plants  <cit>  and is postulated to be an adaptive response to declining water potential  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis and rice plants overexpressing dreb1/cbf have been shown to accumulate proline under control conditions  <cit> . several subsequent studies have demonstrated that transgenic plants overexpressing dreb genes will accumulate proline under control conditions and in response to salt-stress  <cit> , osmotic-stress  <cit> , and cuso4-stress  <cit> . overexpression of esdreb2b can influence the physiological and biochemical responses of transgenic tobacco and mediate the accumulation of proline in response to osmotic-, salt-, cold- and heat-stress.

CONCLUSIONS
the cdna esdreb2b was isolated from the desert plant e. songoricum. esdreb2b encodes a truncated dreb <dig> deduced polypeptide is a novel truncated dreb2-type protein apparently unique to the fabaceae. in e. songoricum, esdreb2b steady state transcript was detectable under non-stress conditions and accumulated in response to a variety of abiotic stresses. esdreb2b was targeted to the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity of a gal4-containing reporter gene. esdreb2b was shown to be a functional dreb protein able to: 1) impart abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic yeast and 2) impart abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco. in our study, the heterologous expression of esdreb2b enhanced the tolerance of transgenic tobacco to osmotic-, salt-, cold- and heat-stress. we conclude that esdreb2b is a promising candidate gene for the development of crops with multiple stress tolerances.
