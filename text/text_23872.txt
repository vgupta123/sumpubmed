BACKGROUND
perennial ryegrass  is the most widely cultivated forage, turf and amenity grass species of global temperate grazing zones. favourable agronomic qualities include high dry matter yield, nutritive content, digestibility, palatability and the ability to recover from heavy defoliation by herbivores  <cit> . perennial ryegrass is, however, susceptible to a number of different foliar diseases. crown rust  is the most widespread and damaging disease affecting ryegrasses  <cit> . stem rust  infections are especially serious for producers of ryegrass seed  <cit> , while grey leaf spot , dollar spot  and brown patch  reduce turf quality  <cit> . the development of cultivars resistant to each of these diseases is currently recognised as an important mode of infection control.

the obligate outbreeding reproductive habit of perennial ryegrass  <cit>  leads to high levels of genetic variation within, and to a lesser extent, between cultivars  <cit> . conventional breeding for disease resistance is hence anticipated to be relatively slow for outcrossing forage species as compared to allogamous species such as cereals, because of a requirement for extensive progeny screening and phenotyping. nonetheless, major genes and quantitative trait loci  for disease resistance have been detected in lolium species for resistance to crown rust  <cit> , stem rust  <cit> , bacterial wilt  <cit> , powdery mildew  <cit>  and grey leaf spot  <cit> . the extent of genetic variation within temperate australasian crown rust pathogen populations  <cit>  is consistent with the presence of different virulence races  <cit> . identification of the molecular basis of major resistance determinants to different pathotypes will improve selection of favourable alleles during cultivar development.

both genetic and physiological analysis has determined that hypersensitive reactions in response to fungal, viral and bacterial pathogen infections are caused by the action of genes encoding receptor proteins  <cit> . the major class of resistance  genes contain a highly conserved nucleotide binding site  domain adjacent to the n-terminus and a leucine-rich repeat  domain involved in the host recognition of pathogen-derived elicitors. nbs-lrrs constitute one of the largest plant gene families, accounting for c. 1% of all open reading frames  in both rice and arabidopsis thaliana, and are distributed non-randomly throughout the genome  <cit> . clustering of r genes is known to facilitate tandem duplication of paralogous sequences and generation of new resistance specificities to counter novel avirulence determinants in evolving pathogen populations  <cit> .

nbs domain-containing sequences have been isolated using degenerate pcr from many agronomically-important poaceae species including cereals  <cit>  and forage grasses  <cit> . in a comparison with the fully-sequenced rice genome  <cit> , only a small proportion of the total nbs domain sequences are so far likely to have been isolated from lolium species. multiple strategies are hence required to isolate a larger r gene sample, allowing for structural characterisation, marker development for genetic mapping, and the potential for correlation with the locations of known disease resistance loci.

disease resistance loci of cereal species are conserved at the chromosomal and molecular level  <cit> , and provide valuable template genes for a translational genomic approach to molecular marker development  <cit> . for example, the talrk <dig> receptor kinase gene  has been found to confer resistance to leaf rust in specific cultivars, and putative lrk <dig> ortholoci are structurally conserved between poaceae species  <cit> . the lrk <dig> orthologue of cultivated oat  exhibits 76% nucleotide similarity to the wheat gene and maps in a region of conserved synteny between the two genomes, co-locating with a large cluster of nbs-lrr genes conferring resistance to the oat form of crown rust   <cit> . the poaceae sub-family pooideae includes perennial ryegrass, along with cereals of the aveneae and triticeae tribes  <cit> , suggesting that template genes from these species are highly suitable for ortholocus isolation.

based on studies of cereal-pathogen interactions, similar qualitative and quantitative genetic mechanisms are likely to contribute to disease resistance in perennial ryegrass. in order to test this hypothesis, a broad survey based on empirical and computational approaches was conducted to recover an enhanced proportion of perennial ryegrass nbs domain-containing sequences, as well as specific r gene ortholoci. candidate r gene sequences  were characterised by functional annotation, motif structure classification and phylogenetic analysis. single nucleotide polymorphisms  were discovered through re-sequencing of haplotypes from the parents of a two-way pseudo-testcross mapping population and validated snps were assigned to genetic maps. co-location with disease resistance qtls was demonstrated within lolium taxa and by comparative analysis with related poaceae species.

methods
bioinformatic approach to template gene selection
a proprietary resource of c.  <dig>  perennial ryegrass expressed sequence tags   <cit>  was integrated into the bioinformatic advanced scientific computing  system  <cit> . each est was functionally annotated using data from microarray-based transcriptomics experiments, the rice ensembl browser, pfam and gene ontology databases. basc was used to search for the presence of nbs-lrr sequences. a text search with the query terms 'disease' and 'resistance' was used to identify candidates based on a wublastx threshold of e = 10- <dig> through known gene ontology within the genomes of closely-related cereal species , rice and arabidopsis.

primer design for candidate lolium r genes
locus amplification primers  for multiple target genes were designed using standard parameters as previously described  <cit> . laps were designed from perennial ryegrass est templates, and sequence tagged site  primers derived from italian ryegrass  nbs sequences located in genbank  <cit> .

primer design based on pooideae r gene templates
laps were designed based on the sequence of four oat lgb-located pca cluster r genes  <cit> , five barley rust resistance genes   <cit> ; and the third exon and 3'-terminus of the talrk <dig> extracellular domain  <cit> .

degenerate primer design
degenerate primers  were designed to the conserved regions  of cloned oat r genes  <cit>  and were used in conjunction with published r gene-specific degenerate primers  <cit>  . based on interpretation of initial amplicon complexity, specific primers were subsequently designed for snp discovery.

amplicon cloning and sequencing
for specific homologous and heterologous r gene-derived primers, pcr amplicons were generated using template genomic dna from the parental genotypes of the f <dig> mapping population  <cit> . for degenerate primers, genomic dna from the crown rust resistant vedette <dig> genotype  <cit>  was used as an primary template, and re-designed primer pairs were used with the f <dig> parents. amplicons were cloned and sequenced essentially as previously described  <cit> , except that a total of  <dig> vedette <dig> clones and  <dig> clones from each of na <dig> and au <dig> were analysed. trace sequence files were used as input materials into the basc module estdb  <cit> .

classification of derived sequences
all candidate nbs-lrr  nucleotide sequences were subjected to two-way blastx and wublastx analysis against the genbank and the uniprot databases, respectively. genomic dna sequences were translated to amino acid sequences using transeq software. each peptide sequence was scanned against the pfam database  <cit>  for the presence of known domains, the type, size and position of nbs domains and the number of lrr repeats. multiple expectation maximisation for motif elicitation   <cit>  was used to detect conserved motifs between sequences containing nbs domains  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of r gene sequences
preliminary alignments of predicted protein sequences was performed manually using bioedit . the alignments were split into two separate datasets , and were realigned for phylogenetic analysis using clustalx  <cit>  with default options. clustering of related sequences based on amino acid homology was conducted using a neighbour joining  algorithm and bootstrap analysis was calculated on an unrooted nj cladogram based on  <dig> iterations using clustalx  <cit> .

plant materials
perennial ryegrass genomic dna was extracted from parents and progeny of the f <dig>  vedette <dig> and p150/ <dig>  <cit>  mapping families using the ctab method  <cit> . a genotypic panel for genetic map assignment was constructed of  <dig> f <dig> and  <dig> p150/ <dig> f <dig> genotypes as previously described  <cit> .

in vitro discovery, validation and mapping of gene-associated snps
pcr-amplified genomic amplicons were cloned and sequenced and dna sequences were aligned essentially as previously described  <cit> . predicted snps were initially validated using  <dig> f <dig> individuals, and those showing mendelian segregation were then genotyped across the full mapping panel through the single nucleotide primer extension  assay  <cit> . integration of snp loci into the existing f <dig> parental genetic maps was performed as previously described  <cit> .

comparative genetic mapping
comparison of chromosomal regions controlling crown rust resistance between perennial ryegrass trait-specific mapping populations was performed using data from qtl analysis of the f <dig> mapping population  <cit> . the f <dig> parental maps contained heterologous rflp and genomic dna-derived ssr  markers shared with the p150/ <dig> and f <dig> genetic maps, respectively  <cit> . comparison of marker locus order between the p150/ <dig> and f <dig> genetic maps was performed through the presence of common lpssr loci  <cit> . this common marker set also allowed interpolation of the position of the lppc <dig> crown rust resistance locus on p150/ <dig> lg <dig>  <cit> . chromosomal locations of lrk <dig> ortholoci were compared between lolium and avena species using common heterologous rflp loci  <cit> . further comparative genomic analysis was conducted using published genetic maps from cereal species including barley, wheat, rye and oat  <cit> .

RESULTS
strategies for specific r gene isolation
three strategies  resulted in the identification of  <dig> primary r gene templates for host genetic analysis . initial pcr amplification and resequencing using the parental genotypes of the f <dig> mapping population allowed identification of a further  <dig> secondary r gene template sequences . a total of  <dig> primer pairs amplified paralogous sequences, at a mean of  <dig>  per primary template sequence, with a range from 1– <dig>  a total of  <dig> distinct putative r gene sequences  were annotated  and subjected to further characterisation. representative genomic sequence haplotypes were deposited as accessions for unrestricted access in genbank . a schematic summary of the candidate gene discovery process and further applications is depicted in figure  <dig> 

lpest = perennial ryegrass est; rg = resistance gene.

in the empirical approach category, translational genomics between perennial ryegrass and closely related cereal species  which are susceptible to other puccinia rust pathogens  was used to identify r genes. perennial ryegrass amplicons derived from oat r gene template primer pairs demonstrated high blastx similarity matches to their corresponding template sequences . primer pairs designed to the talrk <dig> template generated two  <dig>  kb fragments, one of which  displayed very high similarity scores to the putative oat ortholocus .

the specificity of amplification using degenerate primers designed to amplify nbs domains was dependent on the proportion of deoxyinosine -containing nucleotides. those based on oat r gene templates contained a high frequency of inosines  and predominantly amplified retrotransposon-like sequences . in contrast, combinations of largely non-degenerate primer pairs based on sequence information from multiple poaceae species  , successfully generated nbs domain-containing amplicons of the correct size . a total of  <dig> distinct nbs domain-containing sequences  were generated, several primer pairs generating multiple products  .

the text search-based computational approach identified  <dig> distinct perennial ryegrass ests with high sequence similarity to known resistance genes from closely-related species . amplification based on candidate est primary templates was efficient, with only 13% of lap pairs failing to generate amplicons. additional sequences were amplified from several ests, all were putative paralogues showing significant blastx similarity  to known r genes .

database searches for previously-characterised ryegrass nbs sequences identified  <dig> accessions from italian ryegrass-derived clones and a further  <dig> from an interspecific l. perenne × l. multiflorum hybrid . all  <dig> previously-described sts primer pairs successfully generated single amplicons of the expected size .

molecular characterisation of perennial ryegrass r genes
from the total of  <dig> analysed sequences,  <dig>  exhibited blastx matches at e < 10- <dig> to known nbs domain-containing sequences from closely-related cereal species in both the genbank and uniprot databases . in most cases , the highest matching sequence was the same for both databases. sequence translation and subsequent pfam analysis revealed that a substantial proportion of partial protein sequences were similar to the nbs domain . a large proportion of the nbs-category sequences  were within the nbs domain, while the remaining sequences either overlapped the nbs region at the n- or c- terminus, contained the lrr domain, or were located solely within the n- or c- terminal domain. a range of different r gene sub-classes containing nbs, cc-nbs, nbs-lrr, nbs-nbs-lrr, cc-nbs-lrr, cc-cc-nbs-lrr and nbs-nbs domains were detected, but no tir-nbs containing sequences were observed. of the different sub-classes of nbs sequences,  <dig> contained 1– <dig> lrrs ,  <dig> contained  <dig> or more cc domains, and five sequences contained the nbs-nbs domain . a further three receptor kinase and nbs-lrr genes contained trans-membrane domains.

consensuses were determined for the seven major nbs domain motifs   and were compared to those from closely related poaceae species  and to a. thaliana. the p-loop, kin-2a and glpl motifs were most highly conserved between all species examined, while the rnbs-i and rnbs-ii motifs were conserved within the poaceae, and the kin-2a and rnbs-ii motifs were the most conserved among the cc-nbs sequences. the rnbs-iii and rnbs-v motifs were highly divergent between all species.

a total of  <dig> different motif signatures were identified by meme analysis with  <dig> nbs domain-containing sequences at an average of  <dig> residues in length. the most commonly occurring signatures were components of the conserved regions such as the p-loop, kin-2a and glpl motifs . all the distinct sub-classes of nbs sequences present either completely lacked, or contained highly variable rnbs regions. structural analysis revealed substantial diversity in motif content within the nbs domain and grouping of specific motifs into sub-classes based on shared sequence origin.

phylogenetic analysis of perennial ryegrass r genes
phylogenetic analysis was performed based on two selected nbs domain regions . unrelated nbs domain sequences from a. thaliana, lettuce , flax , tomato  oat, rice and barley were included for both regions, as were genbank-derived lolium nbs sequences. a total of  <dig> p-loop-glpl sequences and  <dig> kin-2a-glpl sequences were analysed. amino acid alignment of nbs regions permitted classification into sub-families or classes. a total of seven major clusters were identified for the p-loop-glpl region . candidate sequences were clustered on the basis of similarity to putative orthologues identified from preliminary blastx analysis. the majority were most closely related to those from other ryegrass species, although some showed highest sequence similarity to template genes from other species. sequences similar to rice r genes were also grouped with flax, lettuce and a. thaliana accessions , and a sub-set of ryegrass sequences formed two separate clusters  and may hence be similar to generic r gene variants previously identified in other species, which were not included within the alignment.

eight major clusters were identified for the kin-2a-glpl region . ryegrass-derived sequences were preferentially clustered with those from other poaceae species . sequences from a number of dicotyledonous plant species were separately clustered for the p-loop-glpl , but co-located in several distinct clusters  with ryegrass-derived sequences for the kin-2a-glpl region.

in vitro snp discovery and genetic mapping of perennial ryegrass r genes
sixty-five distinct r gene templates were subjected to in vitro snp discovery through resequencing from parental genotypes of the f <dig> mapping population. genomic dna of a cumulative length of c.  <dig> kb was analysed and a total of  <dig> r gene snps were predicted, at an overall frequency of  <dig> per  <dig> bp. a total of  <dig>  template biparental contigs contained no snps, while  <dig>  of the remaining templates contained under  <dig> snps . all monomorphic r gene contigs were derived from the nbs domain, apart from two encoding receptor kinase-like enzymes. snp incidence was low within introns, due to limited representation in the sample set. snp frequencies within parental genotypes was higher for na <dig>  than for au <dig> . a further  <dig> snps with biparental  segregation structures and  <dig> snps with aa × bb structures were identified.

information on snp frequencies within f <dig> biparental contigs, preliminary validation and positions on the parental maps of the f <dig> and p150/ <dig> population are provided as applicable. the key for conversion of nomenclature from r gene identifier to snp locus identifier  is also provided.

multiple r gene snps from  <dig>  of  <dig> snp-containing r gene contigs were validated . a total of  <dig> r genes were assigned to loci on the parental maps of the f <dig>  mapping population . snps in four r gene loci showed biparental segregation structures, mapping to the equivalent lg position in each parental map, and hence provide bridging markers. five loci were also mapped to equivalent positions on three p150/ <dig> lgs. a single snp locus derived from the template sequence lphvestclone <dig>   was mapped in p150/ <dig> but not in f <dig> 

r gene locus clusters were identified on a number of lgs, often in close proximity to mapped dr gene loci . major clusters were identified in the lower regions of lgs  <dig> and  <dig> and the upper region of lg <dig> of both f <dig>  parental maps .

comparative genetic mapping based on r gene loci
genetic mapping facilitated map integration between trait-specific ryegrass genetic maps, and also comparative relationships with other lolium and poaceae taxa. coincidences between snp loci assigned to the f <dig> parental maps and crown rust resistance qtls detected in other studies were observed for lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  two r gene loci co-located with the crown rust resistance qtls lppc <dig> and lppc <dig> in the lower region of lg <dig> . a further two loci were assigned to the centromeric region of p150/ <dig> lg <dig>   <dig> cm distant from the genomic dna-derived ssr locus xlpssrk02e <dig> which is closely associated with lppc <dig>  this marker locus group also co-locates with lppc <dig> in the f <dig> lg <dig> map, and through comparative alignment, with the hexaploid oat pca cluster on lgb based on the position of the heterologous rflp locus xcdo <dig>  . the r gene snp locus xlprg60-216gt mapped adjacent to a previously-identified crown rust resistance qtl on au <dig> lg <dig>  and in putative alignment with a corresponding qtl on lg <dig> of the lolium interspecific hybrid ψ-f <dig> population map, but a limited number of common markers precluded further interpretation .

comparative genomic analysis detected conserved relationships between perennial ryegrass lrk <dig> r gene snp locus  and the corresponding cereal lrk <dig> template genes. a macrosyntenic region was identified on lg <dig>  although low numbers of common genetic markers again limited the accuracy of extrapolation . the perennial ryegrass r gene loci xlprg24-460at and xlprg54-688ag are derived from putative orthologues of the barley r genes hvs- <dig> and hvs-l <dig>  respectively. alignment of genetic maps revealed conserved syntenic locations, as well as coincidence with qtls for leaf rust and powdery mildew resistance on barley 2h and 3h, respectively .

discussion
large-scale survey of perennial ryegrass nbs domain-containing sequences
this study describes the most comprehensive study to date of ryegrass nbs domain-containing sequences. the largest comparable surveys were of r genes from italian ryegrass  and from both annual and perennial ryegrass and the corresponding interspecific hybrid  by the genome-wide survey of rice  <cit> . it is possible, however, that major rounds of genome duplication or divergence events between species may have occurred, based on different selection pressures of surrounding pathogen populations. such factors may influence the relative number of nbs-containing sequences in ryegrass species.

structural classification of perennial ryegrass nbs sequences
results from the current study suggest that only non-tir nbs sequences are present within the lolium genome, consistent with previous results from monocotyledonous species  <cit> . only degenerate primers specific to non-tir sequences were able to amplify pcr products from perennial ryegrass genomic dna, as observed in similar studies of sorghum  <cit> .

substantial variation was observed within coding regions of non-tir nbs-lrrs, which exhibit greater sequence diversity than the tir-nbs sub-family  <cit> . in this study, many r genes lacked the p-loop region, while others contained nbs-nbs domains, duplicated cc regions or lacked cc and/or lrr domains. p-loop, kin-2a and glpl motifs were conserved and similar in sequence to those of closely related poaceae species such as wheat and rice  <cit>  and the model dicotyledonous species a. thaliana  <cit> . further evidence for structural gene diversity was observed within particular nbs sub-families. nbs sub-classes contained specific signature motifs between conserved regions, and in some instances, rnbs motifs were missing or duplicated. this suggests that the rnbs-i and rnbs-ii motifs may either play a role in pathogen-specific recognition, or be less functionally significant than other, more highly conserved domains mediating resistance in plant species  <cit> . alternatively, the presence of cc-nbs-specific motifs may suggest divergence to perform specialised functions. variability was also observed within lrr domains, suggesting that nbs-lrrs in ryegrass are diverse in function  <cit> .

phylogenetics of lolium nbs domain-containing sequences and relationship to genomic location and evolution
amino acid diversity in the p-loop-kin-2a region may account for the major differences between tir-nbs and cc-nbs domains. the results from this study demonstrate that tir-nbs sequences from flax and a. thaliana group in a separate cluster, as observed in a previous phylogenetic analysis of lolium nbs domains  <cit> . further sequence analysis of a larger number of lolium sequences in the kin-2a-glpl motif interval demonstrated increased sequence similarity with known tir-nbs regions from dicotyledonous plant species, suggesting that this region may be more conserved across taxa. consensus motif order and sequence composition indicates that the lolium rnbs-i region may have diverged from that of dicotyledonous plants. similar results were observed in other poaceae species such as sorghum, for which rnbs-i consensus sequences showed significantly higher similarity to those of rice than to those of a. thaliana tir-nbs genes  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of the p-loop-glpl and the kin-2a-glpl domains detected at least  <dig> nbs sub-classes, as compared to  <dig> separate clusters identified in a previous study  <cit> . analysis of the larger number of kin-2a-glpl interval sequences obtained only one more cluster than for the p-loop-glpl interval, indicative of domain conservation. inclusion of nbs sequences from other closely, and more distantly related, species permitted grouping of r genes and inference of possible common origins for r gene sub-families. sequences amplified from oat templates clustered together with ryegrass template-derived r genes, suggestive of a common origin. based on known mechanisms of r gene evolution, gene duplication and divergence prior to speciation within the pooideae sub-tribe is likely to account for the sequence similarity between ryegrass and oat genes, corresponding to putative orthologues  <cit> .

candidate r gene snp discovery and genetic mapping
the snp frequency observed within this study was marginally lower than that detected within a sub-set of  <dig> perennial ryegrass r genes across  <dig> diverse genotypes  <cit> , but similar to that observed within dr genes  <cit>  and a broad range of functionally-annotated candidate genes  <cit>  in the f <dig> mapping population. eight r gene templates contained up to  <dig> snps per contig, possibly due to paralogous sequence alignment. large numbers of haplotypes have been reported for other perennial ryegrass nbs-lrr genes, especially within variable lrr regions  <cit> . the data from this study suggests that allelic diversity within nbs domain is low compared to the highly variable lrr domain.

previous studies identified significantly non-random chromosomal distributions of nbs-containing sequences  <cit> :  <dig> gene clusters were detected in the japonica sub-species of rice. five major clusters containing two or more closely linked nbs-lrr genes, which frequently showed low mutual sequence similarity, were identified from only a small sub-set  of mapped perennial ryegrass r genes. this suggests that the gene location pattern in perennial ryegrass may be similar to that observed in other plant species. unrelated r genes also mapped in close association with dr gene snp and rflp loci  <cit> . qtl based analysis and genetic mapping in wheat identified co-location of dr and r genes at qualitative disease resistance loci  <cit> . co-location of r genes with dr genes was also observed in similar chromosomal regions  as disease resistance qtls which were mapped both in f <dig> and other trait-specific mapping populations  <cit> .

co-location of r gene snp markers with disease resistance qtls
snp mapping of two candidate r genes in both the f <dig> and p150/ <dig> mapping populations has provided possible candidates for the major gene crown rust resistance qtl  on lg <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether r gene snp variants are of functional significance, further experiments involving transgenic approaches, association genetic analysis or map-based cloning are required  <cit> .

nbs-lrr genes loci mapping to the distal region of lg <dig> in the f <dig> parental genetic maps  are potential candidates for resistance effects to crown rust pathotypes which are yet to be identified within australasia. major qtls for crown rust resistance  have been mapped to the lower part of lg <dig> in  <dig> different perennial ryegrass trait-specific mapping populations  <cit>  but the limited number of common markers limits accurate extrapolation between genetic maps. two qtls of large magnitude were identified in each of the three populations, which were screened using european crown rust isolates however, so far no resistance qtls have been detected within this chromosomal region using isolates from the southern hemisphere. as both f <dig> mapping population parental genotypes are derived from eurasia  <cit> , lg1-located r gene polymorphisms may confer resistance to crown rust isolates of european provenance.

comparative genomics analysis of perennial ryegrass r genes
comparative analysis of r gene snp loci and corresponding ortholoci confirmed previously reported macrosyntenic relationships between perennial ryegrass and other poaceae species  <cit>  in nearly all instances. the sole exception was the xlprg8-271ct locus, which was assigned to lg <dig> despite being derived from  an oat pca template gene predicted to map to lg <dig>  genetic mapping of the lplrk <dig> locus to lg <dig> suggested that the structure and chromosomal location of this gene are highly conserved throughout the pooideae  <cit> . the equivalent analysis for barley r gene ortholoci provides the basis for testing r gene functionality in response to a broader range of plant diseases, requiring significant improvements of pathogen phenotyping  <cit>  and corresponding genetic analysis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated that multiple approaches to r gene discovery, including the use of homologous and heterologous templates, can generate significant numbers of candidate genes for major disease resistance loci. an enhanced resource of r gene templates from perennial ryegrass has permitted evaluation of gene structural diversity and putative evolutionary origins. efficient in vitro discovery methods allowed assignment of r gene-derived snps to genomic locations, revealing coincidence with pathogen resistance qtls in ryegrasses, as well as comparative relationships with other grass and cereal species. r gene-associated markers are suitable for further evaluation and implementation in forage grass improvement programs.
