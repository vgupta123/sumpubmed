BACKGROUND
the bone morphogenic proteins  are a subset of the transforming growth factor β  superfamily and function through the dimerization of the bmpr-1a and bmpr-2a serine threonine kinase receptors. the canonical bmp pathway regulates gene expression via smad <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit>  while the non-canonical bmp pathway regulates nf-κb via the xiap-tak1-tab <dig> complex  <cit> . both pathways help direct proper proliferation and differentiation, embryogenesis and adulthood.

the nf-κb pathway is activated at sites of injury and controls the expression of inflammatory and immune regulating cytokines and chemokines as well as regulating apoptosis and cell cycle. the nf-κb pathway consists of several transcription factors which are bound as homodimers or heterodimers; p <dig> , p <dig> , p <dig> , relb, and c-rel  <cit> . these transcription factors reside in an inactive state in the cytoplasm bound to the iκb family of proteins. activation with various stimuli including but not limited to lps, flagellin, lipid a, ssrna, dsrna and cytokines causes them to be translocated to the nucleus  <cit> . the canonical nf-κb pathway requires ikkαβγ phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of ikbα. previous research has linked the canonical nf-κb pathway to the non-canonical bmp pathway via the formation of the xiap-tab1-tak <dig> complex  <cit> .

adapter proteins play a pivotal role in the regulation and function of signal transduction pathways. activation of nf-κb pathways through the stimulation of toll-like receptors  or interleukin pathways require myd <dig>  irak proteins, and traf proteins to propagate the signal from the extracellular matrix to the tak1-tab <dig> complex which is responsible for the phosphorylation of ikk-α/β. the non-canonical bmp pathway also uses the tak1-tab <dig> complex to drive phosphorylation of ikk-α/β, but uses the ring finger protein xiap instead of traf <dig>  <cit> . the similarity of these two pathways suggested that an additional adapter protein could be present linking xiap-tak1-tab <dig> to the bmpr1a receptor.

a member of the melanoma antigen family, the neurotrophin receptor-interacting mage protein  is ubiquitously expressed in tissue and contains a unique wqxpxx hexapeptide repeat domain, suggesting that nrage has a unique function which differs from the other mage family of proteins. previous studies linked nrage to xiap using a yeast two hybrid screen  <cit>  while we have previously identified nrage as a critical component in the activation of p <dig> and subsequent downstream proapoptotic signals via the non-canonical bmp pathway  <cit> . using a similar approach to kendall et al. in which the expression of nrage was modulated through a series of loss of function and gain of function experiments, we have found that nrage is also a required component in driving nf-κb activation through the bmpr1a-xiap-tak1-tab <dig> complex in 293hek cells.

RESULTS
nrage is required for nf-κb activation in the non-canonical bmp-4
previous reports linked nrage to the xiap-tab1-tak <dig> complex and phosphorylation of p <dig>  <cit> . we wanted to determine if nrage was also required for the activation of nf-κb through the non-canonical bmp pathway. overexpression of full length nrage in 293hek cells resulted in the constitutive phosphorylation of ikk-α and ikk-β  while disruption of nrage expression through sirna resulted in the inhibition of ikk-α/β phosphorylation . when compared to cells transfected with control sirna, the nrage sirna transfected cells showed an ablation in transcriptional activation of the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb after treatment with bmp- <dig> . stimulation with bmp- <dig> or transfection with nrage resulted in translocation of p <dig> to the nucleus as verified by immunofluorescence . transfection of 293hek cells with nrage sirna prior to stimulation with bmp- <dig> abrogated this effect as p <dig> was still found sequestered in the cytoplasm .

to ensure that the activity of nrage on the nf-κb pathway was specific to the non-canonical bmp pathway, the inhibitor ikk-vii was used to eliminate the phosphorylation of ikk-α and ikk-β and ikk-γ and subsequent ubiquitination of iκbα. ikk-vii is a concentration dependent specific atp competitive inhibitor of ikk proteins. inhibition of the ikk proteins resulted in a decrease in p <dig> transcriptional activity in the nrage transfected cells . stimulation of gfp transfected with bmp- <dig> served as an internal control .

previous work has shown that a tak <dig> or tab <dig> morpholino is sufficient for ablation of p <dig> activity in cells overexpressing nrage  <cit> . similar to this, we found that nf-κb transcriptional activation  and ikk-α/β phosphorylation  were ablated in 293hek cells overexpressing nrage when treated with tak <dig> or tab <dig> morpholinos for  <dig> hours. figure 2c depicts endogenous phospho-ikk-α and phospho-ikk-β after stimulation with bmp- <dig> and after incubation with tak <dig> or tab <dig> morpholinos for  <dig> hours.

immunoprecipitation studies using rabbit anti gfp to purify protein complexes involving nrage revealed that phospho-ikk-α and phospho-ikk-β are bound upon overexpression of nrage:gfp fusion protein . incubation of nrage:gfp transfected cells with either tak <dig> or tab <dig> morpholinos for  <dig> hours prevented the formation of the phospho-ikk-α/β and nrage complex . the efficiency of tak <dig> and tab <dig> morpholinos are shown in figure 2e.

overexpression of nrage results in the expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor
although a primary result of non-canonical bmp signaling is apoptosis, we surmise that there is an anti-apoptotic component to this pathway since there is a niche of neural stem cells in the adult brain despite bmp induced apoptosis of neural stem cells during development  <cit> . analysis of 293hek cells stably transfected with either gfp or the adapter protein nrage:gfp using the human cytokine protein array , revealed that macrophage migration inhibitory factor  was highly expressed . analysis of the 293hek egfp stable line stimulated with and without bmp- <dig> was used to determine endogenous expression of mif . mif expression of the 293hek nrage:egfp stable line is shown in lane  <dig> of figure 3b. ablation of mif expression occurred when tak <dig> morpholino was added, prior to bmp stimulation  and when nf-κb inhibitor was added prior to bmp- <dig> stimulation .

overexpression of nrage in the mouse kidney
next, we used mice overexpressing a nrage:cherry fusion protein in the kidney under the control of the hoxb <dig> promoter, to determine if nf-κb would be constitutively active in vivo. histological analysis revealed that there was constitutive phosphorylation of ikk-α/β  and translocation p <dig> to the nucleus  in the nrage:cherry transgenic mouse. there was no detected phosphorylation of either ikk-α/β in the wild type kidneys  or nuclear translocation of the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb . histological analysis of the kidney from the overexpressing nrage:cherry transgenic mouse revealed that there was a dramatic increase in mif expression detected by alexa flour  <dig> , as compared to the wild-type kidney . in vivo overexpression of nrage does not result in the influx of inflammatory cells  as seen by hematoxylin and eosin staining.

nrage induces nf-κb activation and mif expression in p <dig> cells
experiments were conducted in p <dig> cells to demonstrate that the results obtained using  <dig> cells are physiologically relevant. overexpression of full length nrage in p <dig> cells resulted in the constitutive phosphorylation of ikk-α/β while disruption of nrage expression through sirna resulted in the inhibition of ikk-α/β phosphorylation . transfection of p <dig> cells with nrage, renilla and a nf-κb-luciferase reporter vector showed transcriptional activation of the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb . ablation of nrage expression with the nrage sirna disrupted nf-κb transcriptional activity . ikk-α/β phosphorylation and luciferase expression were ablated when nrage sirna was transfected prior to bmp- <dig> stimulation. as was seen in figure 3b, bmp- <dig> stimulation or nrage transfection resulted in an increase in mif expression .

discussion
stimulation of cells with bmp- <dig> activates the canonical and non-canonical bmp pathways. signal transduction through the canonical pathway utilizes smad proteins, while the non-canonical pathway utilizes xiap-tab1-tak <dig>  ultimately using the kinase activity of tak <dig> to activate the p <dig>  jnk, and nf-κb pathway. signal transduction of nf-κb through the non-canonical bmp pathway is similar to the toll-like receptor pathways and interleukin- <dig> pathway which require the formation of traf6-tab1-tak <dig>  both traf <dig> and xiap are ring finger proteins which dimerize and consist of three baculovirus iap repeat domains required for proper orientation of the tab1-tak <dig> complex. the difference is that the tlr and il- <dig> pathways also utilize several adapter molecules linking the traf6-tab1-tak <dig> complex to their membrane bound receptors such as, tram, tirap, myd <dig>  and irak  <cit> . because nrage has already been identified as an adapter protein for p <dig> signaling through the non-canonical bmp pathway, we thought it feasible that nrage also plays a role in nf-κb signaling.

experiments in which cells were transfected with a full length nrage expression vector illustrated that ikkαβ became phosphorylated , induced luciferase expression  and p <dig> translocated to the nucleus . experiments in which the expression of nrage, tab <dig>  or tak <dig> were reduced, either by sirna or morpholino showed that all three proteins were required for nf-κb pathway activation . it was also found that despite overexpression of nrage, silencing of tab <dig> or tak <dig> inhibited nf-κb activation , showing that a reduction in downstream kinase protein concentration is able to overcome an increase in upstream protein concentration. immunoprecipitation of the activated non-canonical bmp complex revealed that nrage and phosphorylated ikkα/β but not ikkα are indirectly bound through tab <dig> and tak <dig> .

taken together, these observations support a mandatory role for nrage in nf-κb signalling through the non-canonical bmp pathway.

tak <dig> is the functional kinase in the non-canonical bmp pathway as well as in interleukin, toll-like receptor and tgf-β signaling pathways; responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of p <dig>  nf-κb, and jnk, and is found complexed together in the cytoplasm with tab <dig>  figure 2c shows that sirna knockdown of tak <dig> but not tab <dig> results in complete inhibition of ikkα/β phosphorylation. this observation is similar to experiments by shim et al., which show that nf-κb activation in embryonic fibroblasts from tak <dig> -/- mice but not tab <dig> -/- and tab <dig> -/- mice is perturbed. it is known that tab <dig> and tab <dig> also associate with tak <dig> and tab <dig> to regulate the classical nf-κb pathway. redundancy in function or protein:protein interactions may compensate for the loss or inactivation of one or more of the tab proteins.

it is interesting to note that nrage influences both apoptosis and nf-κb signaling through two distinct mechanisms in two different pathways. in the non-canonical bmp pathway, nrage binds xiap, sequestering it to the cell membrane resulting in the activation of mapk and nf-κb. while in response to dna damage, nrage prevents the expression of xiap via nf-κb by sequestering che- <dig> in the cytoplasm where it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation  <cit> . does this constitute an intrinsic link between nrage/xiap/nf-κb and apoptosis? and if so will nrage be found to regulate other nf-κb pathways such as the toll-like receptors where xiap is upregulated upon tlr- <dig> stimulation  <cit> ?

protein array analysis of secreted cytokines from the nrage:egfp stable line revealed that macrophage migration inhibitory factor  was highly expressed  and western blot of protein lysates confirmed mif expression in the cytoplasm. stimulation of the egfp stable line with bmp- <dig> for  <dig> hours revealed that mif expression is specific to the bmp pathway, while ablation of tak <dig> detail that mif is being induced through the non-canonical bmp pathway . the mif promoter contains two nf-κb binding sites, located at positions -2538/- <dig> bp and -1389/- <dig> bp  <cit> , inhibition of ikk prior to bmp- <dig> stimulation prevented the expression of mif .

classical research into mif has focused on its regulatory role of immune system  <cit> . recent findings though indicate that mif can control the cell cycle through interactions with jab <dig> and p27kip <dig>  <cit> , control proliferation  <cit> , and inhibit apoptosis through the stabilization of p <dig> and mdm <dig>  <cit> . constitutive activation of the bmp pathway  <cit>  and the expression of mif  <cit>  have been linked to a variety of cancers.

the bmp pathway is required for proper kidney development and function and injury repair  <cit> . mif is constitutively expressed in the kidney  <cit>  and is upregulated in chronic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, and oxidative stress  <cit> . nikopoulos et al. used transgenic mice in which a nrage:cherry fusion protein is under control of the hoxb <dig> promoter and results in constitutive phosphorylation of p38mapk in the kidney through the non-canonical bmp signaling pathway  <cit> . our immunohistological analysis of these transgenic kidneys revealed that there was also constitutive activation of the nf-κb pathway  and an increase in mif expression . it would be interesting to determine if bmp induces mif expression in response to both renal development and injury, counteracting bmp induced renal apoptosis.

bmp expression is present in neural stem cell migratory pathways and the neural crest during embryogenesis, controlling neural crest differentiation and apoptosis in the hindbrain. on mouse embryonic day  <dig>  when corticogenesis begins, bmp- <dig> and  <dig> expression are dramatically increased, affecting neural stem cells in the ventricular zone, inhibiting their proliferation through apoptosis  <cit> . eventually, two neural stem cell niches are established having escaped bmp induced apoptosis; one in the subventricular zone  and one in the subgranular zone . we used the mouse embryonic carcinoma p <dig> cell line a model for bmp induced apoptosis in neural stem cells  <cit> , to illustrate that the bmp nrage nf-κb link is not just restricted to 293hek cells . with the novel finding that mif expression can be linked to bmp signaling and that mif is expressed during embryogenesis  <cit> , it is imperative that the correlation between the anti-apoptotic cytokine mif and bmp driven apoptosis be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
the finding that nrage regulates nf-κb signaling in the non-canonical bmp pathway adds an extra level of control to an already highly regulated developmental pathway. the observation that stimulation of the non-canonical bmp pathway results in mif expression, represents novel crosstalk between a classical immune cytokine and a developmental pathway which requires future consideration.
