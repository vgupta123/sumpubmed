BACKGROUND
the activities of riboflavin  phosphorylation and fmn adenylylation are present among all kingdoms of living organisms. however, whereas eukaryotes use two different enzymes for fmn  and fad  production  <cit> , prokaryotic organisms depend on an enzyme of ~ <dig> kda, fad synthetase , that exhibits both activities  <cit> . thus, fads constitutes a bifunctional prokaryotic protein family of enzymes with both, atp:rf 5'-phosphotransferase  and atp:fmn-adenylyltransferase  activities  <cit>  that catalyses the 5'-phosphorylation of rf to fmn and, subsequently, the adenylylation of fmn to fad.

 rf phosphorylation      rf + atp → fmn + adp 

 fmn adenylylation      fmn + atp → fad + ppi 

the fmn adenylylation reaction of fads is a reversible process, while phosphorylation of rf appears to be irreversible  <cit> . additionally, fads has been shown to function with a broad variety of rf isoesters, and it is, therefore, widely used in the preparation of fmn and fad analogues  <cit> . a kinetic mechanism for the steady-state reaction of the fads from corynebacterium ammoniagenes  has been proposed  <cit> , suggesting an order in substrate binding and product release. the fmn intermediate produced by the first reaction appears to be released by the enzyme to later rebind the enzyme as a substrate for fad production. both enzyme activities present important differences in their substrate requirements, including concentration dependence, specificity for divalent cations and optimal ph or temperature  <cit> .

the c-terminal region of fads  shares considerably sequence similarity with eukaryotic monofunctional rfks. likewise, the n-terminal region has been proposed to present remote similarity to nucleotydyltransferases , suggesting its involvement in the adenylylation process  <cit> . the structure of bifunctional fads has only been reported for the thermotoga maritima enzyme , both free and in complex with some substrates  <cit> . this structure shows that the enzyme is folded in two domains and it also confirms the presence of one atp-binding site in each of the domains and a single flavin-binding site  <cit> . so far, neither functional studies of the tmfads nor fads structures from any other species have been reported.

a sequence analysis of the bifunctional fads family and an in silico structural model for the cafads are here presented. based on these data, a preliminary functional analysis of the cafads has been performed. several residues are shown to be exclusively involved in either the first or second catalytic event. additionally, the c- and n-terminal domains have been independently produced and assayed for their activities. the structural information here provided might help to envisage the rational design of selective antimicrobial drugs with the function of inhibiting fmn or fad production and therefore, the availability in the cell of enzymes depending on these cofactors.

methods
sequence searches and alignments
the primary structure of cafads  was obtained from the uniprotkb/swissprot database  <cit> . a sib-blast search of the complete cafads amino acid sequence was performed at  <cit>  against the eukaryota and bacteria+archaea subsections of the non-redundant data base uniprot knowledgebase . multiple sequence alignment was generated using the clustal w algorithm  with default parameters  <cit> . graphical representation of the multiple sequence alignment was visualised using the weblogo server    <cit> . the sequence numbering used throughout the paper corresponds to cafads.

prediction of a three-dimensional model for the structure of fad synthetase from c. ammoniagenes
the structural model for cafads was constructed using homology modelling procedures based on multiple structure-base sequence alignments  as implemented in the geno3d web server  <cit> . this program uses distance geometry, simulated annealing and energy minimisation algorithms to build the protein models. the structural quality of the models was checked using the procheck validation program  <cit> . the structures of tmfads   <cit>  and those of rfks from h. sapiens   <cit>  and s. pombe   <cit>  were suitable as templates. six different combinations of templates were used and three models were generated by each combination.

prediction of substrate binding sites
predictions of putative atp, mg2+ and fmn binding sites of cafads for fmn adenylylation at the n-terminal domain were carried out by comparing our models with the structures of the nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases  in complex with their substrates . similarly, to model atp, mg2+ and rf binding to the c-terminal domain of cafads, the structures of two rfks in complex with their substrates , as well as the different structures reported for tmfads bound to its different substrates , were used. o  <cit> , spdb-viewer  <dig>   <cit>  and pymol  <dig>  softwares  <cit>  were used for complex modelling, structural analysis and figures production.

cloning and production of c. ammoniagenes wild-type and mutated fad synthetase forms in e. coli
following the ethical rules established at the universidad de zaragoza, strain dsm  <dig>  from c. ammoniagenes was grown at 30°c in a culture medium containing  <dig> % glucose,  <dig> % nacl, 1% tryptone and  <dig> % yeast extract, ph  <dig> – <dig> . genomic dna was isolated from the cells as previously described  <cit> . the cafads encoding sequence was then amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the forward 5'-gtaagccatggatatttggtacggaacag-3' and reverse 5'-ccatcgatagcggatccggcatatac-3' primers, synthesised on the basis of the published nucleotide sequence of the enzyme  <cit> . the primers incorporate the ncoi and bamhi sites respectively, and have the transcription start codon gtg replaced with atg. the amplified  <dig> bp dna fragment was then cloned in the ncoi/bamhi sites of the pet-28a expression vector. the resulting recombinant plasmid, pet28a-fads, was used to transform e. coli bl <dig> competent cells. the transformants were selected on solid lb/agar medium containing  <dig> μg/ml kanamicin. the fragment was sequenced to confirm the accuracy of the amplification. mutations were introduced into the cloned structural gene encoding the wt cafads by site-directed mutagenesis. the h28a, h28d, h31a, h31d, r161a, r161d, s164a, s164d, t165a, t165d, t208a, t208d, n210a, n210d, e268a and e268d fads mutants were generated using the quikchange mutagenesis kit  in combination with the adequate synthetic oligonucleotides. the gene codifying for the individual n-terminal domain fads) was obtained replacing the codon codifying for leu <dig> in pet28a-fads with a stop codon, following the methodology above mentioned for production of site-directed mutants. the c-terminal domain was individually cloned fads) using the protocol described for wt cafads with the forward primer 5'-ccaactgggccatggggcggcac-3' and the reverse primer above used for the full length protein cloning. the forward primer used to clone the c-terminal domain incorporates the start codon atg in a ncoi site substituting for leu <dig>  mutations were verified by dna sequence analysis. wt and mutant fads proteins were over-expressed in e. coli.

purification of recombinant fads from c. ammoniagenes
e. coli cells containing the recombinant pet28a-fads plasmid  were grown in lb. during the exponential e. coli growing phase, fads was induced by overnight incubation at 37°c with iptg . cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -20°c. in a typical purification, around  <dig> g of cells  were thawed, resuspended in  <dig> ml of cell disruption buffer  and broken by ultrasonic treatment at 4°c using  <dig> cycles of  <dig> min in a drh up <dig> dr hielsher sonicator. the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at  <dig> g during  <dig> min. the resulting yellow fads-containing supernatant was fractioned with 45% ammonium sulphate. the mixture was again centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> g and the supernatant was loaded onto a phenyl-sepharose high performance  column equilibrated with  <dig> mm tris/hcl, ph  <dig> , 45% ammonium sulphate. the column was washed with the same buffer containing only 17% ammonium sulphate until most of the yellow colour washed out of the column. the enzyme was eluted using a 17→0% ammonium sulphate reversed-gradient in the same buffer. fractions of 6– <dig> ml were collected while the absorbance at  <dig> nm was recorded. fractions presenting absorbance at  <dig> nm were analysed by sds-page and, those containing the over-expressed fads were pooled and dialysed against  <dig> mm tris/hcl, ph  <dig> . after dialysis the protein was loaded onto a deae-cellulose  column equilibrated with  <dig> mm tris/hcl, ph  <dig> . the column was washed with the equilibration buffer containing  <dig>  m nacl and subsequently eluted using a  <dig> → <dig>  m nacl gradient. fractions of  <dig> ml were collected while recording the absorbance at  <dig> nm and, subsequently analysed by sds-page. the enzyme was considered pure when a single band of the expected size was observed in sds-page. pure fads fractions were pooled together, dialysed against  <dig> mm tris/hcl, ph  <dig>  and stored at -20°c.

measurement of riboflavin kinase and adenylyltransferase activities of fad synthetase
conversion of rf into fmn and, of fmn into fad were qualitatively assayed by addition of the different fads variants  to a solution  containing  <dig> μm flavin ,  <dig>  mm atp and either  <dig>  mm or  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  in  <dig> mm tris/hcl, ph  <dig> . all these chemicals were obtained from sigma and were from the highest purity available. after  <dig> minutes of incubation at 37°c, the reaction was stopped by boiling the preparations for  <dig> minutes. transformation of rf into fmn and fad, or fmn into fad, was visualised by resolving the products of the reaction at room temperature and in the dark by tlc on silica gel sil-g- <dig>  plates  <cit> . the moving phase was a solution of butanol:acetic acid:water . flavin tlc spots were visually examined and scanned by determining their fluorescence under an ultraviolet light. the different flavins move up the plate at different rates due to differences in their partioning behaviour between the mobile liquid phase and the stationary phase. the weaker intensity of the fad fluorescence with regard to equivalent amounts of rf or fmn relates with its flavin fluorescence quenching upon stacking of the adenine portion  <cit> . an additional band, running slightly faster than fmn, is observed in some experiments. the nature of this band is not known, but it is only present in the experiments containing simultaneously fmn and fad.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of the fad synthetase family
no matches for bifunctional fads sequences were obtained when performing the sib-blast search of the cafads sequence on the uniprot knowledgebase eukaryota subsection. when searching the bacteria+archaea database subsection , the  <dig> sequences displaying e-values ≤  <dig>  were chosen for further analysis. redundant sequences from the same species presenting sequence identity over 80% were eliminated. the remaining sequences included some proteins noticeably shorter as well as proteins lacking the typical consensus sequences found in fadss. these sequences , most of them displaying the lowest e-values of the selected sequences, were removed and separately analysed. they could be sorted out into several groups: i) proteins that present only the n-terminal region of fads, ii) proteins that present only the c-terminal region of fads, iii) proteins that lack the first conserved motif in the n-terminal region, iv) proteins with a conserved n-terminal region and a c-terminal region that shares no similarity with the bifunctional fads family, and v) proteins with a conserved c-terminal region and a n-terminal region that shares no similarity with the bifunctional fads family . some of these divergent proteins belong to organisms that also possess a typical prokaryotic fads sequence.

after the manual refinement, a multiple sequence alignment over the remaining  <dig> fads-like sequences, displaying e-values ≤ 2xe- <dig> with cafads, was carried out. only fadss from the genus corynebacterium displayed sequence identities over 50% with the cafads . however, the multiple alignment pointed out several highly conserved residues and motifs . motifs 21-Φ-g-Ω-f-d-g-Φ-h-Ω-g-h-Ω- <dig> and 162-Φ-s-s--Ω--r-Ω-Ω-Φ-Ω-Ψ-g- <dig>   corresponded to two consensus sequences in the fads family that are also conserved in nts remotely related to fads . two additional consensus sequences in between the above mentioned motifs were also observed. they included residues 50-Ω-Φ-Φ-Ω-f-Ψ-p--p-Ω- <dig> and 120-Φ-Φ-Φ-g-Ω---Ω--g-Ω- <dig>  and, apparently, only the motif 123-g-Ω-Ψ- <dig> presents an equivalent in nt sequences . multiple sequence alignment also showed a number of residues highly conserved, or conservatively substituted, between residues  <dig> and 186: i <dig>  r <dig>  g <dig>  i <dig>  d <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  y <dig>  v <dig>  a <dig>  l <dig> and g <dig> . these residues are mainly included in region n <dig> and at the end of n <dig> in figure  <dig> and, can be considered as forming additional consensus sequences. noticeably, only r <dig> and a <dig> are conserved in nts.

the c-terminal region of the bifunctional fads sequences  also included several consensus sequences, 191-g-Ω-v-Φ-Ψ-g-Ω-Ω-Ω-g-Ω-Ψ-Φ- <dig>  205-g--p-t--n- <dig>  223-p-Ω-Ω-g--- <dig>  253-Ψ-Φ-g-Ω-Ψ-p-t-- <dig>  267--e-Ω--Φ----Ψ-Φ---y-- <dig> and 291--r-Ω--Ω--- <dig>  and the highly conserved residues l <dig> and d <dig> , being all of them also conserved in the sequences of rfks .

structural model of the fad synthetase from c. ammoniagenes
a 3d structural model for the cafads has been produced based on the structure of the tmfads   <cit> . the low sequence similarity of the n-terminal domain of fadss with nts prevented these enzymes to be used as templates   <cit> , but the sequence similarity found at the c-terminal domain of the fads family with rfks from h. sapiens  <cit>  and s. pombe   <cit>  allowed them to be used as templates. these rfks were used for the construction of the model in those loops were the x-ray structure of tmfads did not show experimental information  <cit> . models for the cafads c-terminal domain generated using as templates only the structures of rfks were consistent with the c-terminal structure reported for tmfads, indicating that rfks are a good choice as templates for this fads family domain. stereochemistry and energy analysis of the produced models suggested that the model constructed using the fads and rfk templates reported in table  <dig>  was adequate to describe the 3d structure of cafads until structures are provided by experimental methods.

according to the model, the protein folds in two domains. the n-terminal domain  lacks the first  <dig> residues of the sequence , while the c-terminal domain  lacks the last  <dig> residues  . the main structural arrangements predicted for the cafads are present in the structure reported for the tmfads  <cit> , but our model also showed the disposition of some loops and a 310-helix at the c-terminal domain that are missed in the tmfads structure. additionally, the c-terminal domain of cafads showed an insertion around residue  <dig> with regard to tmfads and many members of the fads family.

the kinase domain: the c-terminal domain of c. ammoniagenes fad synthetase
the c-terminal domain of the cafads model  folds in a central six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel stabilised between the single final α-helix , the two small α <dig> and α <dig> of the n-terminal domain and several loops . a short 310-helix is also predicted in our model between residues g201-l <dig>  this c-terminal domain showed a high sequence identity in the 3d space with the structures of the templates  and, there is no doubt that it must contribute to atp, mg2+ and rf binding to produce fmn. comparison of this model with the reported tmfads and rfks structures in complex with their substrates will provide information about cafads residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis . therefore, it is expected that the adp-mg2+, or atp-mg2+, will be nested at one edge of the β-barrel, between two loops . the first loop  contains the short 310-helix and the 207-ptΦn- <dig> consensus sequence conserved in rfks  and, it is proposed to stabilise the p groups . the structures of rfks in complex with adp-mg2+ also suggest that t <dig> and n <dig> might contribute to metal binding  <cit> . the second loop  starts with the e <dig> residue, invariant in fads and rfk families and proposed to link the terminal oh group of the rf ribityl chain, acting as a catalytic base  <cit> . this loop also includes the d <dig> and y <dig> conserved positions, proposed to stabilise the atp adenine ring, while v <dig>  k <dig> and d <dig> might contribute to stabilise the ribose  by similarity with rfks  <cit> . comparison of models with tmfads and rfks complexed with rf or fmn suggests that the isoalloxazine ring must be bound in a pocket formed by the outer surface of the β-barrel  and the long terminal α <dig> helix. the flavin ring might result stabilised by the hydrophobic environment provided by the consensus region 223-g-v-y- <dig> and the conserved f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  l <dig> and m <dig> residues, while its hydrophilic portion may be pointing towards the opening of the pocket and stabilised by e <dig> or k <dig>  <cit> . other residues apparently not directly involved in flavin binding but contributing to the formation of the bottom and top of the pocket include the consensus region 254-g-Ω-Ψ-p-t-- <dig> and the highly conserved residues r <dig> and d <dig>  respectively. these two later residues apparently form a salt bridge that contributes to fix the terminal α-helix close to the top of the flavin ring cavity . the ribityl chain would extend towards β <dig>  interacting as above mentioned with e <dig> .

the models for cafads suggest flexibility in the loops connecting β6–β <dig> and β9–β <dig> . both of these regions are not solved in the structures reported for the tmfads  <cit> . flexibility is also observed in regions involved in substrate binding , in agreement with conformational changes observed in rfks upon substrate interaction  <cit> . these conformational changes provide additional interactions, for both the ribityl tail and the isoalloxazine ring and, help to anchor the reactive substrates and the catalytic residues in the most adequate disposition for catalysis  <cit> . this analysis also suggests that despite rfks and fadss surely share a similar mechanism in the rf phosphorylation reaction, variations in the structural details for substrate binding and catalysis can be expected.

the adenylyltransferase domain: the n-terminal domain of c. ammoniagenes fad synthetase
the cafads n-terminal domain consists of a classical α/β dinucleotide binding domain. its core is formed by a twisted five-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by two long and two short α-helices and the corresponding connecting loops . the end of this domain forms a small subdomain made up of two small α-helices , which are in contact with the c-terminal domain. the cafads model was compared with the structures reported for several enzymes of the nt α/β phosphodiesterase superfamily , either free or in complex with their substrates  <cit> . members of this family catalyse the transfer of a nucleotide monophosphate moiety, from a nucleotide triphosphate , onto different substrates. our cafads n-terminal model presents an overall folding conserved in nts  that allowed improvement of the sequence alignments and production of putative models for the interaction between this cafads domain and its substrates . the consensus regions 19– <dig> and 162– <dig>  highly conserved in the fads and nt families , are proposed to be involved in ntp stabilisation in the active site. in our model these motifs include the α <dig> helix , placed between β <dig> and β <dig>  the e158-s <dig> loop and some portions of the two terminal antiparallel α-helices,  and α <dig> ) . residues of these consensus regions show a high conservation in primary and 3d structures when comparing the fads and nt families. thus, in cafads: i) main-chain atoms of g <dig>  f <dig> and d <dig> might h-bond the α-p of atp, ii) h <dig>  g <dig> and h <dig>  might contribute to stabilise the p groups and adenine moiety of atp, iii) the atp p groups might interact with l <dig>  t <dig>  i <dig>  g <dig> and the 104– <dig> and 153– <dig> regions, iv) the consensus region 162– <dig>  must be involved in stabilisation of the adenine, β-p and γ-p of atp and, v) the 123– <dig> consensus motif accommodates the ribose portion of the nucleotide , as proposed for the equivalent residues in tmfads, glycerol- <dig> phosphate cytidylyltransferase , phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase  and nmnat   <cit> . the loop formed by residues 156– <dig> , although conserved in sequence and structure, shows different orientations and lengths in the different nts, which probably determines the enzyme specificity for the ntp   <cit> . the cafads model also showed several positively charged side-chains highly conserved in the fads family and structurally situated in positions also occupied by positively charged side-chains in nt structures. these include r <dig> and r <dig> . their positions suggest that these side-chains might contribute to stabilise the adenine and p groups of atp when bound to the active site. it is also worth noting that an important number positions occupied by conserved glycines in the fads family are also conserved in sequence and structure in nts and, in many cases, their main-chain atoms directly provide h-bonding to the nucleotide .

flexible regions can be predicted by comparison of the cafads models . these, including 55– <dig>  85– <dig>  111– <dig> and 127– <dig>  correspond to low similarity regions between nt and fads families . structures of nmnat in complex with nad+  <cit> , and ppat in complex with dpcoa  <cit>  or ppant  <cit> , indicate that the binding of the adenylylation substrate, nmn+ or ppant moieties, is allocated in the pocket formed by the above mentioned regions. superposition of these complexes on our cafads model, followed by fitting and sculpting the fmn molecule along the nicotinamide nucleotide moiety of nad+ in the nmnat structure, allowed production of putative models for the interaction of the fads n-terminal domain with its fmn substrate . in this model, the fmn isoalloxazine ring would be placed in a cavity surrounded by the above mentioned flexible regions. the entrance of this cavity would be flanked by the f <dig>  f <dig> and d <dig> hydrophobic side-chains, the consensus region 54-fphp- <dig> would fix the position of the ribityl of fmn, while the flavin ring environment would be contributed by hydrophobic interactions with v <dig>  l <dig>  y <dig> and f <dig> . all these positions are highly conserved in the fads family, but do not have equivalence in nts . the model suggests that the hydrophobic isoalloxazine portion of the flavin ring might be embedded inside the cavity, while the hydrophilic edge would be partially exposed to the solvent. the size of the cavity makes it difficult to predict the precise location of the isoalloxazine ring. various possibilities are allowed  and, final disposition of loops and side-chains would depend on the flavin binding event and conformational changes not predicted in our model. this flavin binding mode could represent a novel flavin binding motif so far not described. additionally, while sequence motifs n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> are also conserved in the sequences of eukaryotic fmn adenylyltransferases, residues and regions proposed for flavin binding in the fads family do not present homologous in the sequences of the monofunctional enzymes .

this is the first structural model where a putative binding site for the flavin is suggested at the adenylylation site of fads, indicating the presence of two independent flavin binding sites in the fads family. an early hypothetical model for the active site of fads proposed a single flavin binding site for both activities and two independent atp binding sites  <cit> . no structural information of this family of enzymes was reported at that time, but that model accounted for the kinetic mechanism experimentally derived  <cit> . the 3d structures and models today available for fads indicate that the phosphorylation and adenylylation sites are far away . this fact is in agreement with experimental observations indicating that the fmn produced in the phosphorylation process was released from the protein, to subsequently rebind to initiate the adenylylation process  <cit> . superposition of our cafads model in complex with all its substrates with the dimer reported in the tmfads crystallographic asymmetric unit also indicates that phosphorylation and adenylylation active sites from different monomers are far away to share the fmn molecule. however, this dimeric model suggests that the 229– <dig> loop and the terminal α <dig> of the c-terminal domain might contribute to the formation of the atp and the flavin binding pockets in the adenylylation domain .

production of c. ammoniagenes fad synthetase forms
e. coli bl <dig> cells transformed with the recombinant pet28a-fads vector produced a high level expression of active cafads. this cafads was purified in complex with one of the products of its reaction, fad, as confirmed by hplc . to remove the fad a hydrophobic chromatography was required. the sequence and structural analysis suggested the presence of several residues and motifs in cafads highly conserved in this family of enzymes and potentially involved in the catalytic sites of the rfk and nt activities. some of these residues were mutated, namely h <dig>  h <dig>  r <dig>  s <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  n <dig> and e <dig> to ala and asp. these cafads variants were expressed in e. coli, with yields similar to the wt fads, and were purified to homogeneity following the same protocol. additionally, plasmids individually expressing the n-terminal and c-terminal cafads domains were also produced, pet28a-Δfads and pet28a-Δfads, respectively, and transformed in e. coli, showing a level of expression similar to the full length protein.

c. ammoniagenes fad synthetase residues involved in fmn and fad production
the ability of the different individual cafads mutants to catalyse conversion of rf into fmn and of fmn into fad was analysed by incubating the same amount of each mutant with the substrates of both enzyme activities. reactions were carried out under two different mg2+ concentrations; one favouring the rfk activity  and the other favouring the nt activity   <cit> . however, both concentrations produced similar qualitative results under the assayed conditions. the products of the reactions were analysed by tlc .

replacement of h <dig> with either ala or asp and h <dig> with ala prevented conversion of fmn into fad, confirming their implication in the cafads nt activity. both of these his residues belong to a consensus region 27-Φ-h-Ω-g-h-Ω- <dig> found both in fads and nt families . therefore, h <dig> and h <dig> will surely be major determinants in the stabilisation of the p groups and the adenine moiety of atp in the reaction transition state in cafads, in agreement with previous observations in nts  <cit> . replacement of h <dig> with ala also prevented the conversion of rf into fmn, pointing to a possible influence of the n-terminal domain in the rfk activity. his <dig> appears situated at the n-terminal of α <dig>  in contact with α <dig> and α <dig>  which, according to our model, will interact with the c-terminal domain from the same polypeptide chain, but also might influence the c-terminal of the second monomer in a putative dimeric structure . however, it is difficult to envisage how the h28a mutation might affect the phosphorylation reaction with the available information. this will need further structural and biochemical characterisation. replacement of h <dig> with asp produced an enzyme still able to produce fmn and fad, suggesting that an asp at this position somewhat replaces the function of the his. replacements were also introduced in the second major consensus sequence shared by the fads and the nt families, 162-Φsst- <dig>  replacement of s <dig> or t <dig> with ala produced enzyme forms able to transform rf into fmn and fmn into fad, while the introduction of a asp residue at such positions clearly prevented fad formation. this latter observation was consistent with these residues being involved in the stabilisation at the nt catalytic site of the negatively charged β-p and γ-p of atp or the ribityl end, as suggested by the above structural analysis . finally, the putative role of the structural disposition of the positive charge of r <dig> in the stabilisation of the adenine and α-p and β-p of atp in the active site was studied by replacement of r <dig> with either ala or asp. the produced fads mutants were still able to produce fmn and fad under the assayed conditions, suggesting the positive charge at position of r <dig> is not playing a critical role in cafads catalysis.

taking into account the fact that t <dig>  n <dig>  and e <dig> are conserved in sequence and structural position in the close environment of the atp, not only in the fads family but also in rfks, and that the terminal oxygen of the ribityl of rf binding sites , a catalytic role for them in the rf phosphorylation process can be envisaged. these cafads residues were replaced with ala or asp to prove such a role. all these mutations prevented fmn production, but allowed transformation of fmn into fad, confirming their implication in the rfk activity of fads. these data are, therefore, in agreement with the proposed structural-based role for t <dig> and n <dig> in accommodating the active portion of the atp molecule, the p groups, and the metal in the catalytic centre . the lack of fmn and fad production when replacing e <dig> with ala confirms it is a key residue in the cafads rfk activity. analysis of the interaction of the cafads model with fmn  also indicated that in cafads e <dig> side-chain might h-bond to the terminal oh of the ribityl chain of rf . this glu is invariant in the fadss and rfks families . in this later family this residue has been proposed to act as a catalytic base  <cit> . moreover, the fact that incubation of e268d with rf did not produce any accumulation of fmn, while traces of fad were detected, is consistent with the rfk activity taking place at a very slow rate in this mutant, thus avoiding fmn accumulation. this suggests that although the introduced mutation is conservative and the asp side-chain might still act as a base, its shorter side-chain prevents the optimal organisation of the transition state in the active centre and, therefore, reduces the catalytic efficiency of the rfk activity. again, this is consistent with this residue not presenting substitutions, even conservative ones, in the analysed proteins. nevertheless, other explanations might be also possible, as higher catalytic efficiency of nt activity than that of rfk or sensitivity of the tlc analysis. further work should be done by the analysis of the kinetic parameters for both activities, as well as of the interaction parameters for the different substrates, for all these cafads mutants to provide additional insights in their specific role in the enzyme catalytic mechanisms.

activity of the independently produced c. ammoniagenes fad synthetase n- and c- terminal domains
crude extracts of the e. coli cells expressing the individually cloned n-terminal and c-terminal domains of cafads, Δfads and Δfads, respectively, were prepared and assayed for nt and rfk activities . analysis of the products of the reaction by tlc concluded that the c-terminal domain, Δfads, was able to qualitatively catalyse the phosphorylation process. however, crude extracts over-expressing the n-terminal domain, Δfads, were not able to catalyse the conversion of fmn into fad. extracts containing both domains were mixed and assayed for both reactions. conversion of rf into fmn was produced in these samples, but they were not able to mimic cafads in the adenylylation process. this is in agreement with a possible c-terminal domain role in contributing to the stabilisation of the flavin and atp substrates in the corresponding n-terminal domain pockets .

CONCLUSIONS
a sequence analysis has been carried out in the bifunctional fads family. an important number of consensus regions and conserved residues have been determined, despite the low sequence identity among members of this family. sequence divergences found among pathogenic organisms, such as mycobacterium or corynebacterium, and monofunctional eukaryotic enzymes will probably be reflected in structural divergences that might affect the catalytic mechanism, making possible the design of specific antimicrobial drugs. models have been proposed, not only for the cafads structure, but also for the complexes formed with all its substrates. this includes de interaction with the fmn substrate at the adenylylation site, in a region not previously reported as involved in the enzyme activity and, in a pocket that might constitute a novel flavin binding motif. as expected, these models supported that the n-terminal presents similar folding to nts and is involved in the adenylylation of fmn, whereas the c-terminal is similar to rfks and responsible for the phosphorylation. models of cafads allowed identification of several residues putatively involved in the catalysis. site-directed mutagenesis on some of these residues confirmed their participation in substrate stabilisation and/or the catalytic mechanism. the particular behaviour of some of these mutants and of the independently expressed nt and rfk domains suggests one of the domains might influence the activity in the other one. this study sheds important and new information on the structural mechanism of substrate recognition and catalysis while waiting for the experimental structure of the cafads and provides a platform for future investigations into the mechanism of enzymes of the bifunctional fads family.
