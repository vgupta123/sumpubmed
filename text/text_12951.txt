BACKGROUND
severe acute respiratory syndrome  is an emerging infectious disease  <cit> . in contrast to most other coronaviruses, which cause mild infection, the new sars-cov has a high mortality rate. because the re-emergence of sars is possible due to existence of sars-cov like strains in animal reservoir, development of safe and effective vaccines is highly desired. the sars-cov genome is composed of single positive stranded rna and encodes four main structural proteins including spike protein , membrane protein , envelope protein  and nucleocapsid protein   <cit> . the s protein is involved in not only receptor recognition but also in virus attachment and its entry into target cells  <cit> .

in attempts to develop vaccines against various pathogens, research on dna vaccine has been widely carried out. using dna vaccines, both humoral and cellular immune responses are induced  <cit> . a few studies demonstrated that dna-based vaccines can induce protective immune response against several viruses  <cit> . however, one of the problems with dna-based vaccines is that they are incapable of inducing immune response in mice when injected through the intranasal  route  <cit> . in light of the fact that the entry of most respiratory diseases is through the mucosal surface, it is obvious and ideal that a vaccine should induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses. secretory iga plays a major role in mediating mucosal immunity  <cit> . mucosal immune responses take an important role as a first line of immune defense system against influenza virus infection although parenteral immunization is not enough to provoke protective immunity  <cit> .

polyethylenimine  has been widely used as the non-viral vector in vitro and in vivo due to high transfection efficiency and buffering capacity  <cit> . it has been shown that mucosal administration with pei could function as a potent mucosal immunostimulator  <cit> . it has been revealed that pei is a very effective gene delivery vehicle for lung transfection producing high antibody titers against the encoded protein  <cit> . in the present study, the immune responses in balb/c mice immunized with sars dna vaccine via i.n. route have been examined.

RESULTS
characterization of pei/pci-s complexes
it is well known that transfection efficiency of gene carrier depends upon its ability to condense dna into nano-sized particles  <cit> . as expected, pei condensed dna into nano-sized particles, suggesting their endocytosis potential .

the formation of pei/pci-s nanoparticles was further confirmed by morphology observation. representative energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy  images of the pei/pci-s nanoparticles at n/p ratio  <dig> are shown in figure 1b. the nanoparticles were observed as spherical shape with around  <dig> nm size, which are similar to those measured by dynamic light scattering. it is notable that cytotoxicity of pei was measured in raw  <dig>  cells after transfection with pei/pci-s complexes by using mtt assay. the cell viabilities decreased slightly when the n/p ratios of pei/pci-s complexes increased. when the n/p ratio was  <dig>  the cell viability was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . in order to confirm pei/pci-s uptaken by raw <dig>  cells, rhodamine labeled pci-s dna was used to form the nanoparticles with the pei and the complex was visualized by confocal microscopy. as shown in figure 1c, the labeled nanoparticles can be seen in the cells, near to the nucleus. rt-pcr analysis showed both pci-s dna and pei/pci-s nanoparticles can transfect the cells. in fact, the pei/pci-s nanoparticles induced much stronger s mrna expression than that of naked dna . western blot analysis further confirmed that the cells treated with pei/pci-s nanoparticles can induce the expression of detectable s protein whereas no protein was detected when pci-s was used alone .

sars-cov s-specific antibody responses and b cell proliferation capacity
to evaluate the influence of pei on adaptive immunity to sars-cov s protein, specific antibody responses were examined in mice immunized i.n. with sars-cov dna vaccine. immunization with pei/pci-s complexes elicited high level of sars-cov s-specific-serum igg antibody but not in mice immunized with sars-cov s dna alone . to access the balance of th1/th <dig> response, sars s-specific igg <dig> and igg <dig> were evaluated in immunized mice. sars s-specific igg <dig> antibody was significantly  increased in mice immunized with sars-cov s dna vaccine plus pei whereas little increase was observed on sars-specific igg2a antibody production , indicating th <dig> dominant response. to examine mucosal antibody production, lung wash, nasal wash, fecal extracts, saliva and vaginal wash of immunized mice were collected. the result showed that sars s-specific iga antibody response was significantly  increased in lung wash from mice immunized with pei/pci-s complexes .

to assess b lymphocyte proliferation against sars-cov spike protein, the notion that antibody responses enhanced was further confirmed by proliferation ability of b220+ cells at  <dig> week after the last vaccination. b220+ cells from mice immunized with pei/pci-s complexes were highly proliferated after in vitro re-stimulation with sars-cov s protein .

expression of cell surface molecules and maturation of dendritic cells  from the mice stimulated with pei/pci-s complexes
the maturation of dcs is accompanied with enhanced expression of surface markers, including co-stimulatory and mhc class molecules. to examine the effect of dna vaccination on dc maturation in vivo, mice were immunized i.n. with pei/pci-s complexes. the surface expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> co-stimulatory molecules were significantly  higher on dcs from mice treated with pei/pci-s complexes than those from sars-cov dna s vaccine alone . mhc class ii, i-ad, expression was also up-regulated significantly  in pei/pci-s complexes group as compared with that of sars-cov dna alone .

improvement of sars-cov s-specific t cell responses by pei/pci-s complexes
to examine t cell immunity to sars-cov s dna vaccine, cytokine profiles were examined by using intracellular cytokine assays. the cells were harvested from the lung at  <dig> days after the immunization. it has been suggested that t cells producing ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α are especially effective in protective immunity  <cit> . amount of ifn-γ-producing cells were increased in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from mice immunized with pei/pci-s whereas il-17-producing cells were increased only in cd4+, not cd8+ t cells. it is notable that ifn-γ+, il-2+ and il-17+ cells were not detected in cd8+ t cells from the mice immunized with pei/pci-s complexes . re-stimulation with sars-cov s peptide induced the activation of cytokine-producing cd4+ and cd8+ t cells with a predominant production of tnf-α as well as tnf-α and il- <dig> double cytokine-producing t cells in mice immunized with pei/pci-s complexes . furthermore, ifn-γ and il- <dig> double cytokine-producing cells were found more in the pei/pci-s complexes group while it was not detectable in pci-s group. it is to note that il-4-producing cells were detectable neither in the lung nor spleen .

discussion
in the twenty first century, sars was the first emerging infectious disease that has seriously threatened public health and the economy throughout the world  <cit> . over  <dig>  people from  <dig> countries were infected with sars-coronavirus, resulting  <dig> deaths  <cit> . it has been shown that sars-cov spike protein  plays an important role in receptor recognition, virus attachment and its entry  <cit> . it represented one of the most important targets for the development of sars vaccine  <cit> . to prevent and control sars outbreaks, several vaccine studies based on the spike protein of sars have been done including s protein vaccine, fragment dna vaccine, full-length dna vaccines and receptor binding domain  <cit> . dna vaccine encoding full-length s protein has shown to induce humoral, cellular and protective immune responses against sars-cov  <cit> . in the current study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a pei/pci-s in mice through intranasal immunization.

there have been several reports that pei/dna complexes enhance transfection efficiency in mammalian cells and augment immunogenicity  <cit> . in the present study, we have adapted this pei/pci-s complex for mucosal dna vaccination. the size of pei/pci-s complexes appeared to be about  <dig> nm. the effect of pei/dna complexes on transfection, and gene and protein expression in raw  <dig>  cells were evaluated by measuring the expression of the mrna and protein, respectively. this result, thus, let us move ahead to in vivo studies for mouse immunization via intranasal route using pei/pci-s complexes.

a number of studies attempted to develop sars dna vaccines, exclusively via systemic routes including intramuscular injection  <cit> . as sars is a respiratory pathogen, among the sars vaccine candidates, targeting intranasal immunization was likely to be more effective to induce protective immune responses against infection when compared with other delivery routes. intranasal immunization of pei/pci-s complexes induced higher antigen-specific serum igg responses than pci-s alone. coincidently, antigen-specific igg <dig> was also dramatically increased when compared to igg2a, suggesting th <dig> dominant response. also the immunization enhanced antigen-specific iga response in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and b cell proliferation after in vitro re-stimulation with the spike protein. in garzon's study, antigen-specific antibody and t cell responses have been dose-dependently increased in mice immunized with dna vaccine up to  <dig> μg  <cit> . however, in our study each mouse was immunized with only  <dig> μg of dna. despite the small amount of dna, it has induced not only systemic but also mucosal immune responses.

dcs play a pivotal role for the effective induction of antigen-specific immune responses. dcs are found throughout the body and are considered as one of the first-line sentinel cells  <cit> . when dcs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns from microorganisms, dcs became mature and acquired capacity for the antigen presentation, concomitantly augmented the expression of mhc proteins  <cit> , cytokines  <cit>  and number of co-stimulatory molecules including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  <cit> . thus, the maturation of dcs is essential for appropriate initiation of the subsequent adaptive immune responses  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrated that the pei/pci-s complexes increase the co-stimulatory and mhc class ii molecules on dcs from cervical lymph nodes after intranasal immunization.

the cellular immune responses are mediated by both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells. functional study indicated that antigen-specific t cells produce cytokines including ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> after in vitro re-stimulation with sars spike peptides. ifn-γ is an effector cytokine, critical for activating macrophages and dcs and inhibiting viral infection  <cit> . tnf-α is a cytokine that probably regulates immune cells and inhibits viral replication  <cit> . il- <dig> mediates the expansion of t cells and maintains memory t cells  <cit> . il- <dig> mediates the production of antimicrobial peptide and immunoglobulin for neutralizing viral infection  <cit> . in the current study, we have shown that antigen-specific cd4+ and cd8+ t cells secreted ifn-γ, tnf-α, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> in non-lymphoid tissues such as lung. furthermore multiple-cytokine producing cells are increased in mice immunized i.n. with pei/pci-s. it is probable that these cells are likely responsible for the protection when host is infected with sars-cov after the vaccination. in fact, it has been suggested that multi-cytokine producing antigen-specific cd4+ t cells are functionally superior on protection to single-cytokine producing cells  <cit> . there are several reports that multi-cytokine producing t cells have shown to correlate with protection against leishmania major infection  <cit> . in the current study, the pei/pci-s complexes induced a high frequency of tnf-α+ il-2+ cd4+ t cells and ifn-γ+ il17+ cd4+ t cells, and tnf-α+ il-2+ cd8+ t cells when assessed by sars peptide recall responses. taken together, our results support the hypothesis that intranasal immunization with pei/pci-s complexes induces ideal cellular responses for the protection.

CONCLUSIONS
pei is effective in delivering dna onto the mucosal surface, in maturation of dendritic cells and in improving the immunogenicity of the dna vaccine. our results indicated that pei can be used as a vector for the mucosal delivery of dna vaccine and play an important role in b cell and t cell immunities.
