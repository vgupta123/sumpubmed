BACKGROUND
hair follicle morphogenesis requires signaling interactions between epithelial cells and adjacent dermal cells that form the specialized mesenchyme called the dermal papilla. during these processes, sonic hedgehog  signaling is required in both the epithelial and dermal compartments. inappropriate epithelial shh target gene induction is sufficient to cause basal cell carcinoma , one of the most common tumors in caucasians, with an incidence of over a million cases per year in the u.s. bccs also have a striking reliance on adjacent stroma for continued growth and invasion, implying that non-cell autonomous factors influence the extent of shh target gene induction in tumors  <cit> . despite extensive study, factors that regulate epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during normal or neoplastic epithelial growth remain poorly understood.

the primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle crucial for the regulation of shh signalling and growth . receptors positioned within the cilium transduce signals through transcription factors that are activated directly in the cilium or in the cell body. mutations giving rise to defective primary cilia or improper placement of signaling molecules within the cilium result in a plethora of clinical manifestations  <cit> . in particular, mutations in genes encoding intraflagellar transport proteins impair shh signaling and result in limb bud and neural tube defects similar to those seen with inactivating mutations of the shh pathway  <cit> . two recent reports describe requirements for ift <dig>  an intraflagellar transport component, and missing in metastasis, an actin regulatory protein, for shh signalling in the dermal papilla and depict a necessary role for the primary cilia in hair follicle development  <cit> . moreover, a requirement for the primary cilia in bcc formation has been demonstrated, which reinforces the importance of the primary cilia in shh signaling and epithelial downgrowth  <cit> .

laminin- <dig>  a basement membrane zone protein, is also required for hair follicle downgrowth. laminin- <dig>  and laminin- <dig>  are the most abundant laminins in developing and adult skin. both are secreted from keratinocytes and incorporate into the basement membrane zone of hair follicles and interfollicular epithelia, but lm <dig> is particularly abundant in the basement membrane zone surrounding hair follicles . laminins also signal intracellularly through transmembrane receptors, including the integrin family of heterodimers. in the skin epithelium, the most abundant lm <dig> receptor pair is integrin alpha- <dig>  beta- <dig>  lm <dig>  on the other hand, predominantly associates with integrin alpha- <dig>  beta- <dig> in hemidesmosomes  <cit> . these interactions have only been described, however, for integrin receptors within epithelial cells, not dermal papilla cells.

mice null for the alpha  <dig> subunit of lm <dig>  show arrest of hair follicles during the hair germ stage of hair follicle morphogenesis. arrested follicles resemble shh-null follicles, indicate reduced expression of shh and gli <dig> in hair follicle epithelia and have a reduction in epithelial proliferation  <cit> . furthermore, previous results indicated that primary cilia are absent in the dermal papilla of lamα5-/- mice at e <dig>   <cit> . these and additional observations suggested that epithelial derived lm <dig>  through binding integrin beta- <dig> , maintains the primary cilia in dermal papilla cells and is therefore required for shh ligand reception in those cells.

in contrast, epithelial-derived laminins are also known to act directly on the epithelium to promote invasion. developmental studies with conditional mutants of epithelial itβ <dig> demonstrate its role in epidermal/dermal attachment and proper hair follicle development  <cit> . in human graft models of scc, epithelial downgrowth depends on both itβ <dig> and lm <dig>  which indicates a need for both adheshion and signaling for continued epithelial growth  <cit> .

here we use a human bcc model system and a conditional mouse mutant lacking itβ <dig> in dermal mesenchyme to re-evaluate the role of lm <dig> in epithelial downgrowth. we provide evidence that lm <dig> interaction with integrin β <dig> in epithelium, rather than with dermal papilla, is required for hair follicle invagination.

RESULTS
lm <dig> and lm <dig> blockade inhibits bcc invasion but not shh signaling
human skin xenografts overexpressing shh ligand provide an excellent model to study in vivo bcc lesion formation  <cit> . we used antibody blocking reagents in conjunction with this model to determine whether laminin function is required for bcc formation in these grafts. the 4c <dig> antibody binds the lm <dig> globular domain and thereby inhibits integrin binding  <cit> . the bm <dig> antibody was raised against the α <dig> subunit of lm <dig> <cit> . for experiments receiving a single antibody  animals received intraperitoneal injections carrying  <dig>  mg of antibody starting in the first week of growth and then every week thereafter. in a preliminary experiment, we determined that blocking grafts with both lm <dig> and lm <dig> antibodies in the first week of growth results in severe blistering, so in this case we began injections in the second week of growth. some grafts, especially those treated with bm <dig> to block lm <dig> function , were lost due to the formation of scar tissue in the graft site  <cit> .

shh/igg grafts form bcc-like lesions as expected  and contain thickened epidermis and invaginations with hallmark bcc features including pallisading basal cells and the strong presence of dermal cells at the epidermal/dermal boundary . this contrasts sharply with the thin, orderly skin present in gfp/igg control grafts . we confirmed that all grafts analyzed contain human skin, and not murine host skin, using species-specific human involucrin antibodies . we also determined that graft tissues incorporate both human lm <dig> and human lm <dig> into the basement membrane zone, exclude mouse lm <dig> and are targeted by injected blocking antibodies . severe invaginations similar in appearance to those in shh/igg grafts are also evident in all shh/4c <dig> grafts , indicating that lm <dig> blockade does not reduce shh-mediated bcc formation . on the other hand, blocking both lm <dig> and lm <dig> function  inhibits the bcc epithelial invagination seen in shh/igg grafts. in each of the double-blocked grafts, stratified epithelium was present with little if any epithelium progressing past the dermal/epidermal boundary.

lack of bcc epithelial invasion could be caused by lack of shh responsiveness or shh-dependent invasiveness, so we next assessed the shh target gene induction in double-blocked grafts. as expected, gfp expressing tissues display only a single layer of keratin 10-negative  cells  whereas those of shh/igg and shh/4c <dig> grafts demonstrate extensive basal layer proliferation and invagination. notably, the epithelium of shh/4c <dig>  bm <dig> grafts exhibit 2- <dig> layers of keratin- <dig> negative cells similar to the keratin- <dig> expression profile of non-invasive regions of shh/igg and shh/4c <dig> grafts. these grafts show additional basal layer proliferation and indicate persistent shh response in lm511/lm <dig> blocked tissues.

to probe this issue further, we determined the expression of shh target genes as well as indicators of epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. to determine the extent of shh target gene induction in the grafts, we performed rna in-situ hybridization with dig-labeled rna probes for ptch <dig>  a direct target of shh pathway activation. anti-sense probes for ptch <dig> show the presence of shh target gene expression, concentrated in basal cells at the leading edge of epithelial invaginations, in shh/igg and shh/4c <dig> grafts . despite the reduced appearance of invaginations in shh/4c <dig>  bm <dig> grafts, these grafts contain ptch <dig> transcript concentrated in the basal half of the epidermis. the expression of these genes is specific, as gfp-expressing xenografts do not show detectable levels of these transcripts. in addition, control sense probes corresponding to the ptch <dig> transcript do not provide signal in all grafts . we conclude, then, that the lack of epithelial invagination in shh/4c <dig>  bm <dig> grafts is not due to an inability of the shh pathway to activate target genes.

shh signaling has a variety of effects on responding cells in a tumorigenic context, but its most notable effects are an increase in proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis in responsive cells. if laminin blockade reduces shh target gene induction, it may affect the proliferation or apoptotic index of responsive tissues. therefore, we determined the extent of proliferation and apoptosis in xenograft lesions. we assessed the extent of proliferation in xenografts with immunofluoresence for ki <dig>  a marker of cellular proliferation. gfp/igg grafts contain a limited number of proliferating basal cells, restricted to a single cell layer, in the epidermis . gfp/4c <dig>  bm <dig> grafts likewise contain few proliferating basal cells. as expected. shh/igg and shh/4c <dig> grafts contain an abundance of proliferating cells within tumor invaginations. concordant with the histological phenotype, shh/4c <dig>  bm <dig> grafts contain fewer proliferating cells than shh/igg or shh/4c <dig> grafts. however, these tissues contain more proliferating cells than the control gfp/4c <dig>  bm <dig> grafts and even contain proliferating cells in suprabasal layers of the epidermis, which mirrors the proliferation profile of non-invasive regions of shh/igg and shh/4c <dig> tissues . this indicates that blockade of lm <dig> and lm <dig> in shh-expressing grafts does not affect the increased proliferation of cells experiencing excess shh ligand.

in order to determine the apoptotic index in graft tissues, we utilized a fluorescent tunel assay. if laminin blockade affects shh survival signals, we would expect to see an increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei in antibody-treated grafts. this is not the case, as all grafts only show apoptotic nuclei within the stratified layers of the epidermis, not in the relevant basal layer . we conclude, then, that blockade of lm <dig> and lm <dig> in human skin xenografts also does not abolish any anti-apoptotic effects mediated by shh signalling in epithelial cells.

our results regarding shh target gene expression, proliferation and apoptosis in xenograft tissues indicate that antibody blockade of lm <dig> and lm <dig> does not drastically reduce shh response of relevant cells in a tumorigenic context. since lm <dig> has been suggested to affect shh target gene induction in the developing hair follicle via maintenance of the structure of the primary cilium, we also investigated the presence of this structure in our graft experiments.

human skin xenografts contain epithelial and dermal primary cilia
using antibodies to adenyl cyclase iii for cilia shaft and rootletin for the basal body, we were able to visualize primary cilia in epithelial cells of all human skin xenografts . furthermore, in shh-expressing grafts, we can also visualize primary cilia in dermal cells adjacent to the basement membrane zone . combinatorial staining for keratin  <dig>  which localizes to all suprabasal cells, indicates that the presence of the primary cilia in a cell negatively correlates with keratin  <dig> expression. invasions within shh/igg or shh/4c <dig> grafts have a greater ratio of keratin 10-negative  epithelial cells to all epithelial cells , and likewise indicate a large number of cells with primary cilia. grafts expressing control virus contain only a single layer of keratin 10-negative/cilia-positive cells and exhibit primary cilia only in these cells. accordingly, non-invasive regions of shh/igg and shh/4c <dig> and all regions of shh/4c <dig>  bm <dig> grafts have 2- <dig> layers of primary cilia-containing basal cells . so, we can conclude that blocking lm <dig> alone or blocking both lm <dig> and lm <dig> does not ablate primary cilia in epithelial cells or dermal cells adjacent to the basement membrane zone in our xenograft model. we, therefore, also conclude that any negative effect that lm <dig> and lm <dig> inhibition has on tumor invasiveness is primary cilia-independent.

dermal papilla in hair follicles of lamα5-/- mice appear normal at e <dig> 
the absence of effects of laminin blockade on primary cilia formation and shh responsiveness in human skin xenografts lead us to revisit the previously established relationship between lm <dig>  primary cilia and shh responsiveness in developing murine hair follicles. in particular, we examined whether lamα5-/- mice have discernible differences in known early dermal papilla markers compared to wild type mice. we first confirmed that lamα5-/- mice lack lm <dig> incorporation in the basement membrane zone. the antigen is apparent around hair follicles of control and absent from those in null mice . we next compared the expression of several markers of developing dermal papilla in e <dig>  mice  <cit> . for the early dermal papilla markers cd <dig>  p <dig> and syndecan- <dig>  we find similar expression in dermal condensates associated with stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> hair follicles in control and lamα5-/- animals . in addition, we also quantified the number of p75-positive dermal cells per hair follicle in these mice and obtain similar results for stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> follicles in control and null animals. our analysis, then, fails to show any abnormalities in the dermal papilla of lamα5-/- mice at e <dig> .

similarly, we examined the presence of primary cilia in dermal papilla of e <dig>  lamα5-/- mutants. we find that mutant mice do contain primary cilia in dermal condensates of developing hair follicles . at e <dig> , we observe primary cilia in dermal cells adjacent to presumptive placodes, identified as areas of epidermal thickening . at e <dig> , we identify the dermal papilla in stage  <dig> follicles with cd <dig> and observe primary cilia in these cells . the number of dermal papilla cells containing primary cilia was quantified in wild type and lamα5-/- mice at e <dig>  and no significant difference was detected . in addition, both wild type and null animals display cilia at  <dig> - <dig>  μm in length . we conclude that in the absence of lm <dig> protein, dermal papilla differentiation and primary cilia formation proceed normally up to e <dig> .

epithelial, but not dermal, itβ <dig> is required for hair follicle epithelial invasion
a drawback of studies with lamα5-/- mutants is that lm <dig> is a secreted molecule that can associate with both epithelial and dermal cells, preventing definite conclusions as to the cell type in which it is required. consequently we investigated the cell-autonomous requirement for the lm <dig> receptor, itβ <dig>  in dermal cells using both blocking antibodies and mouse mutants. initially, we confirmed the effectiveness of the itβ <dig> blocking antibody, ha2/ <dig>  <cit> . we soaked e <dig>  wild type skin with control igm and ha2/ <dig> antibody overnight and then grafted the treated skin onto the back of immuno-compromised  mice for continued growth. grafted skin treated with control antibody formed stable stratified epithelia and regions of dense hair . on the other hand, grafted skin first treated with ha2/ <dig> antibody to itβ <dig> formed only a minimal patch of graft-derived hair  and some attached stratified epithelia. in large part, these treated grafts resulted in blistered graft skin, indicating that blocking itβ <dig> function in the epithelial cells reduced the ability of the epidermis to remain associated with the basement membrane and form hair, which is in line with previous reports of epithelial itβ <dig> function in skin   <cit> .

with this antibody capable of blocking itβ <dig> function in murine skin, we treated wild type e <dig>  whole backskin with itβ <dig> blocking antibodies overnight, an experiment previously reported to eliminate primary cilia in dermal papilla cells  <cit> . here, treated skin still contains primary cilia in both epidermal and dermal components of developing hair follicles . in these tissues, both control treated and ha2/ <dig> antibody treated skin displayed approximately 65% of dermal papilla cells with primary cilia . this result was consistent when a range of concentrations of blocking antibody was used, from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml . this indicates that the ha2/ <dig> antibody is effective in blocking itβ <dig> function, but does not reduce primary cilia in wild type skin. this corroborates our observation of the presence of primary cilia in the dermal papilla of lamα5-/- mice and argues against a role for lm511/itβ <dig> in ciliogenesis.

to confirm our results with blocking antibodies, we examined skin function in a mouse lacking itβ <dig> in the mesenchyme cells of the ventral and lateral skin. mice expressing prx- <dig> driven cre-recombinase have been previously used to demonstrate a requirement for primary cilia components in hair follicle  <cit> . thus, we reason that if lm <dig> association with itβ <dig> is required in dermal cells for primary cilia formation/maintenance or proper shh signaling, conditional deletion of itβ <dig> in this cell population should also negatively affect hair follicle morphogenesis.

indirect immunofluorescence for itβ <dig> in ventral/lateral skin of p <dig> prx1-cre; itβ1flox/flox mice indicates that these late stage hair follicles do not express itβ <dig> in dermal papilla cells . in control mice, immunofluorescence for itβ <dig> shows cell surface expression of itβ <dig> on basal keratinocytes, hair follicle epithelial cells and dermal papilla cells . this expression pattern partially overlaps with that of p <dig> which is found on the cell surface of dermal papilla, suprabasal keratinocytes and in hair follicle epithelial cells in these late-stage follicles. on the other hand, ventral hair follicles in conditional knockouts contain p75-positive dermal papilla cells void of itβ <dig> expression . in skin of these mice, itβ <dig> expression still overlaps with p <dig> expression in hair follicle epithelial cells . we also demonstrate that conditional deletion of dermal itβ <dig> does not disrupt localization of lm <dig>  as in control skin, lm <dig> is observed in dermal itβ <dig> knockouts incorporated into the basement membrane zone of interfollicular epidermis and hair follicles and is especially pronounced in the basement membrane zone surrounding follicles . this indicates that conditional deletion of dermal itβ <dig> does not disrupt the localization of lm <dig> in developing hair follicles and that the formation of the basement membrane zone is not driven by dermal itβ <dig> but by epidermal itβ <dig> only  <cit> . we additionally confirmed that deleting itβ <dig> from dermal cells does not disrupt additional components of the basement membrane zone or extracellular matrix around endothelial structures. immunolocalization of tenascin c, fibronectin, perlecan, collagen i and collagen iv are all comparable in p <dig> skin of control and conditional knockouts .

at post-natal day  <dig> , prx1-cre; itβ1flox/flox mice look relatively normal except for reddened skin in the areas of expected prx1-cre expression . we currently do not know the cause of this reddened appearance, as histology does not indicate inflammation in the skin of these mice . histological examination of ventral skin above the sternum in conditional knockouts reveals hair follicles in stages varying from placode to stage  <dig> peg . analogously, p <dig> mice maintain the reddened appearance and small size of p <dig> mice. like control mice, the ventral skin of conditional knockout mice at p <dig> contains abundant fully developed hair follicles. quantification of the stages of hair follicles in p <dig> and p <dig>  control and knockout mice indicates comparable developmental patterns . post-natal hair cycling is also normal in knockout mice, as adult mutants have normal hair coats in knockout regions .

in order to confirm that deletion of dermal itβ <dig> does not have discernable effects on skin development, we determined the expression of epithelial differentiation markers loricrin and keratin- <dig> in skin of conditional knockouts. loricrin expression is found in the stratum granulosum of properly differentiated epidermis. this expression pattern is evident in control and prx1-cre; itβ1flox/flox skin . similarly, conditional knock-outs display a normal expression pattern of keratin- <dig>  which localizes to the stratum spinosum and granulosum of the epidermis . deletion of epithelial itβ <dig> causes reduced presence of integrin alpha- <dig> and integrin beta- <dig> in associated basement membrane zone  <cit> . this is not the case in prx1-cre; itβ1flox/flox mice as the expression of these integrins is not altered in basolateral membranes of basal keratinocytes . as in lamα5-/- mice, dermal papilla markers appear normal in hair follicles of prx1-cre; itβ1flox/flox mice. we tested expression of p <dig> and syndecan- <dig> in conditional knockouts and find expression domains and levels similar to those in control mice . we also determine that the number of p75-positive dermal papilla cells per hair follicle in dermal itβ <dig> knockouts is comparable to that in control mice at p <dig> in both stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> hair follicles . in addition, we confirmed the presence of primary cilia in dermal papilla of hair follicles in prx1-cre; itβ1flox/flox skin . we quantified the presence of primary cilia in stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> hair follicles at this time point and find no difference in the presence of cilia in control versus conditional knockout animals . this indicates that dermal itβ <dig> is not required for the formation of primary cilia in dermal cells or the condensation of dermal cells into dermal papilla. therefore, unlike deletion of itβ <dig> in epithelial cells, which has been shown to be necessary for proper skin and hair formation, deletion of itβ <dig> from dermal cells does not impact this tissue.

discussion
in developing skin, laminins have been reported to act via their integrin receptors on both the epithelium as well as the underlying dermal organizer. using a human model of skin epithelium, we have shown that inhibition of laminin- <dig> and  <dig> function prevents epithelial invagination, but leaves the primary cilia and shh target gene induction apparently intact. consistent with a primary effect on the epithelium, few abnormalities derive from removing the laminin receptor itβ <dig> in dermal cells, thus clarifying how laminin- <dig> functions in the skin.

lm <dig> and lm <dig> in primary cilium and shh signaling
the primary cilium has quickly garnered attention as a sensory organelle required for correct processing of shh signal reception during hair follicle development and tumorigenesis. a previous model suggested that the structure of the primary cilia in the dermal papilla dependended on extracellular cues from the basement membrane zone through lm <dig> binding to dermal itβ <dig>  <cit> . our current work, however, argues against a direct role for laminins  <dig> or  <dig> in ciliogenesis or shh target gene induction. these differences may be, in part, due to a previous lack of precise aging of embryonic mice, which may have resulted in the inadvertent study of degenerating hair follicles and skin after the mutant animals began to be reabsorbed in utero. in addition, the use of mouse anti-human acetylated tubulin antibody to detect cilia, which is sub-optimal in mouse skin due to extensive background staining of anti-mouse secondary antibodies, may have exacerbated these problems. these are difficulties we believe we have overcome through careful mouse breeding and the optimization of primary cilia staining protocols. we believe our conclusions regarding the lack of a role for lm <dig> and itβ <dig> in the dermal papilla are accurate because of the technique optimization, and the corroboration of our results from analysis of the dermal itβ <dig> mutants. recent studies from our lab and others have shown the important role of actin and the microtubule cytoskeleton in maintaining cilium structure  <cit> . however, our current results reiterate the paucity of information known about ciliogenesis and the extracellular cues that regulate cilium function.

in our human bcc xenograft model, blocking both lm <dig> and lm <dig> is required to inhibit tumor invasion, while blocking of lm <dig> alone has no discernable effect. these results sharply contrast with the inhibition of lm <dig> in human hair follicle xenografts, which dramatically inhibits hair follicle epithelial invasion using comparable doses of blocking antibody in a similar experimental setting  <cit> . we have thus uncovered a potentially important difference between hair follicle and bcc epithelial growth. in invaginating hair follicle epithelium, lm <dig> is the predominant laminin supporting hair follicle growth, while in bccs lm <dig> appears to be sufficient to compensate for loss of lm <dig>  interestingly, recent functional studies reinforce the differences between hair follicle and bcc epithelium. forced activation of the shh pathway in interfollicular epithelium, but not hair follicle epithelium induces bcc, suggesting that coexpression of lm <dig> and lm <dig> seen in the interfollicular epithelium may offer a selective advantage for invading tumors  <cit> .

lm <dig> and itβ <dig> in hair follicle morphogenesis
the presence of normal late stage hair follicles in prx1-cre; itβ1flox/flox mice indicates that dermal itβ <dig> signaling is not required for proper hair follicle morphogenesis. conditional knockout of epithelial itβ <dig>  on the other hand, clearly constitutes a requirement for epithelial itβ <dig> in skin and hair development  <cit> . this may be partially due to the role of itβ <dig> in the formation of a stable basement membrane zone. lm <dig> is also important for basement membrane zone stability, as lamα5-/- null mice contain a discontinuous lamina densa specifically in association with hair follicles  <cit> . the importance of the basement membrane zone for epithelial downgrowth is also indicated by the lack of invagination after lm511and lm <dig> inhibition in our human xenograft model of bcc.

previous studies of lamα5-/- mice also noted the reduced expression of shh and gli <dig> transcripts by rna in-situ in epithelia of e <dig>  hair follicles  <cit> . this indicates that lm <dig> may have an indirect effect on the expression of shh ligand, and that this effect may represent one aspect of the more extensive skin phenotype in epithelial itβ <dig> mutants. given the requirement of reciprocal signaling during morphogenesis, we speculate that reduced shh signaling in the hair follicles of lamα5-/- mice may be a result of failed association of epithelial cells with the basement membrane zone and/or reduced expression of shh ligand in hair follicle epithelia, which eventually results in degeneration of both follicle and dermal papilla. therefore, our results and previously published data lead us to assert a primary effect of lm <dig> function on epithelial cells. we cannot yet exclude the possibility that lm <dig> may function via an unidentified dermal papilla receptor, but current available data does not support this alternative.

CONCLUSIONS
• lm <dig> and lm <dig> are required for tumor invagination in a xenograft model of human bcc, but are not required for shh target gene induction or primary cilia formation.

• lamα5-/- mice exhibit a stage-specific defect in hair follicle morphogenesis. stalled hair follicles contain dermal papilla with normal cell numbers, early marker expression and cilia.

• deletion of dermal itβ <dig> does not affect hair follicle morphogenesis or post-natal hair cycling. itβ1-null follicles contain dermal papilla with normal cell numbers, early marker expression and primary cilia

• these results suggest that lm <dig> may participate in hair follicle morphogenesis by acting on the hair follicle epithelium, perhaps in part by facilitating epithelial cell invagination or regulating shh ligand expression.
