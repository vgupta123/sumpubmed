BACKGROUND
one of the main objectives of cereal breeding is to expand genetic variability within cultivated species. wild species, related to cultivated crops, are an important source of variability. inter-specific hybridization can be used to introgress genetic variability from wild species into crops and to produce new species with valuable agronomic traits. an example of this is the hexaploid tritordeum, an amphiploid obtained by crossing triticum turgidum l.   with hordeum chilense  . primary tritordeums exhibit enormous genetic variability for many valuable agronomic and quality traits. for example, the grain and flour from tritordeum has similar functional properties to bread wheat  <cit> , but with higher pigment content  <cit> . most of this genetic variability can be attributed to h. chilense, a wild relative of cultivated barley  that occurs exclusively in chile and argentina which is highly polymorphic both morphologically and biochemically. the variability for important agronomic traits, such as endosperm storage proteins  <cit> , carotenoid content  <cit>  and resistance to biotic stresses  <cit> , linked to its high crossability, makes h. chilense a suitable candidate as a source of genetic variability for the transfer of useful genes to wheat by wide crossing. however, in the process of hybridization, undesirable traits such as rachis brittleness and non-free threshing characters, present in wild barley, are also transferred to the hybrid, limiting its use as an alternative cereal crop.

many genetic systems have been proposed as responsible for the free-threshing character in hexaploid wheat. mackey  <cit>  proposed a polygenic system distributed throughout the three genomes that counteracts glume tenacity and rachis brittleness. a second system is related to the major gene or gene complex q  <cit>  located in the long arm of the chromosome 5a which governs the free-threshing character and square spike phenotype. in addition, the q gene pleiotropically influences many other characters determinant for domestication such as rachis fragility  <cit> , glume shape and tenacity  <cit> , spike length  <cit> , plant height  <cit>  and spike emergence time  <cit> . other genes which influence the free-threshing habit include the tg locus, located on chromosome 2d  <cit>  that codes for tenacious glumes and is thought to inhibit the expression of the q gene.

simons et al.  <cit>  have cloned and characterized the q gene in wheat and showed that it has a high homology to members of the apetala <dig>  family of transcription factors. this gene family is characterized by two plant-specific dna binding motifs referred to as ap <dig> domains. the ap <dig> genes form a large multigene family, and play multiple roles during the plant life cycle being key regulators of many developmental processes such as floral organ identity determination or control of leaf epidermal cell identity  <cit> . many studies in arabidopsis have revealed that the ap <dig> gene is implicated in the establishment of floral meristem identity  <cit> , floral organ identity  <cit>  and the temporal and spatial regulation of flower homeotic gene expression  <cit> .

in the present work, we have cloned and characterised an ap2-like gene from accessions of h. chilense and h. vulgare, wild and domesticated barley respectively, and compared these with other homoeologous genes, including the q gene from wheat. the pattern of expression of the ap2-like gene in floral organs and other tissues in barley, wheat and amphiploid tritordeum was also studied. the results are relevant to understanding the role of the ap2-like gene in the spike morphology of barley and wheat and in hybrids obtained from their crossing and for modification of the expression of ap2-like genes to modify the spike characteristics of cereals for breeding purposes. in addition, the results provide insight into how important agronomic genes such as ap <dig> are regulated in cereal hybrids.

RESULTS
structure of the ap2-like genes from h. vulgare and h. chilense and their predicted proteins
genomic dna and complete cdna sequences obtained in this work from h. vulgare cv betzes  and h. chilense , and their predicted proteins were searched using blastn and blastp algorithms. results showed a high homology to many floral homeotic genes and their corresponding proteins such as the t. aestivum floral homeotic  mrna , the h. vulgare ap2-like mrna , the zea mays indeterminate spikelet  <dig>  mrna , the oryza sativa transcription factor ap2d <dig> mrna  and the a. thaliana apetala <dig> . all these genes belong to an ap <dig> subfamily of putative transcription factors which are characterized by the presence of two dna binding motifs, referred to as ap <dig> domains, which consist of  <dig> and  <dig> conserved amino acids, respectively . predicted proteins for h. vulgare cv betzes and h. chilense lines reported here, also revealed the presence of these ap <dig> domains in the deduced amino acid sequences. the structure of the ap2-like genes of the hordeum genotypes is similar to that of other ap2-like genes . they all presented  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns, and the  <dig> nt microrna binding site , which is highly conserved in all ap2-like genes with only a single nucleotide change in the t. aestivum cv chinese spring ap2-like sequence .

 the percentage of identity was estimated by a comparative alignment of all sequences with that of h. vulgare cv. betzes 

the orfs from h. vulgare cv betzes  and h. chilense  ap2-like genes were aligned and compared. table  <dig> shows all the nucleotide changes , insertions and deletions) and their positions with respect to h. vulgare cv betzes . fifty-two polymorphisms were observed among the three genotypes, three of them were insertions/deletions  and the rest were snps. only sixteen of the polymorphisms  caused changes in the amino acid sequence.

all the nucleotide changes  and their positions with respect to the sequence of h. vulgare cv betzes  are shown. polymorphisms causing changes in the amino acid sequence are indicated in bold and with asterisks.

comparison of the ap <dig> predicted proteins from h. vulgare cv. betzes  and h. chilense lines h <dig> and h <dig>  with other ap2-like proteins is showed in figure  <dig>  all the ap2-like proteins compared had similar structural organizations: motif  <dig>  motif  <dig>  the nuclear localizing signal, the first ap2-domain , the second ap2-domain , and motif  <dig>  the two ap <dig> domains were strongly conserved among the different species. hence, the two ap <dig> domains were almost identical in the three triticeae species compared  with only a single amino acid change in the h. vulgare sequences  and another in the t. aestivum sequence . the three motifs and the nuclear localizing signal were also highly conserved in all the species aligned in figure  <dig>  the relationships among the ap2-like proteins was confirmed by constructing a phylogenetic tree based on the the neighbor-joining method . the resulting tree showed that the hordeum genotypes clustered together and very close to t. aestivum while the rest of the genotypes were distant.

chromosomal location of the ap2-like gene in h. chilense
the chromosomal location of the ap2-like gene in h. chilense was demonstrated by using a 5hch addition line of wheat, a 5d/5hch substitution line of tritordeum , and a 1d/1hch and 2d/2hch double substitution line of tritordeum . figure  <dig> shows the result of the amplification by pcr of a sequence of the genomic barley ap2-like gene using the pair of primers ap2*f2/ap2hch*r <dig> and the dna isolated from the above genotypes. amplification of the barley ap <dig> was obtained in genotypes carrying the 5hch chromosome, these are h. chilense h <dig>  the 5hch addition line of t. aestivum cv. chinese spring, and the tritordeum lines ht <dig>  and ht <dig>  in contrast, the wheat cv. chinese spring and the tritordeum line ht <dig>  did not show amplification . this result shows that the ap2-like gene in h. chilense is located in the chromosome 5hch and tritordeum line ht <dig>  lacks the 5hch chromosome and therefore the ap2-like gene.

quantitative real-time pcr of ap2-like genes
the expression level of the ap2-like genes were determined in different tissues by qrt-pcr in wild  and domesticated  barley, durum wheat , bread wheat , and tritordeum . we designed two sets of primers to specifically amplify a fragment of the ap2-like cdna corresponding to wheat genome  and hordeum genome  respectively . therefore, primer pair ap2*f2/ap2ta*r <dig> was used to quantify the expression of the wheat ap2-like gene in durum and bread wheat  as well as in tritordeum genotypes ht <dig>  ht <dig> and ht <dig>  on the other hand, ap2*f2/ap2hch*r <dig> primers were used to quantify the expression barley ap2-like gene in h. chilense , h. vulgare , and in the above tritordeum genotypes. the amplification result of each pair of primers is shown in figure  <dig>  the qrt-pcr product of each reaction had a unique melting temperature peak, indicating that specific amplification occurred. figure 4a shows the dissociation curves and agarose gel electrophoresis of genotypes h <dig>  h <dig>  t <dig> and bw <dig>  the two peaks corresponding to triticum genotypes  had the same melting temperature , while the wild barley  peak had a lower melting temperature . the cultivated barley dissociation curve  presented a melting temperature of  <dig> °c. the expected product size was  <dig> bp for triticum genotypes and  <dig> bp for both wild and cultivated barley. this fragment of  <dig> bp contains  <dig> snp differences between wild  and cultivated barley  and is identical in h <dig> and h <dig>  consequently, differences in melting temperature of pcr products between wild and cultivated barley can be explained by those  <dig> snps found between the two sequences. figure 4b shows the dissociation curves and agarose gel electrophoresis of the specific amplification of the wheat and barley ap2-like genes using the three tritordeum lines ht <dig>  ht <dig> and ht <dig>  as above, the predicted product size was  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for wheat and barley ap2-like genes, respectively. although this  <dig> nucleotide difference could not be observed in the agarose gel, different melting temperatures were detected for each pcr product, indicating that specific amplification occurred in tritordeum background. in addition, melting temperatures of pcr products in tritordeum lines of both wheat ap2-like gene and barley ap2-like gene were similar to that in wheat genotypes and wild barley respectively, as described above .

the expression of wheat and barley ap2-like genes was determined in roots, stems, young leaves, and spikes at various developmental stages, and normalized with the expression of the actin gene as a reference. figure 5a and 5b compare the relative expression of the ap2-like gene in wild  and cultivated  barley, and in durum  and bread  wheat. expression of the ap2-like gene was detected in all the tissues and genotypes. in roots and stems, wild barley  had higher transcription levels than cultivated barley . in turn, durum wheat had higher expression levels in roots but lower in stems than that of bread wheat. all four genotypes showed similar expression levels in young leaves. in the case of spikes, expression levels of the ap2-like gene decreased in all genotypes over the course of development and emergence of the spike . figures 5c and 5d compare the level of transcription of the corresponding wheat and barley ap2-like genes in the three tritordeum lines tested. line ht <dig> has the 5d/5hch substitution whereas line ht <dig> has the double substitution 1d/1hch and 2d/2hch. finally, line ht <dig> is a tritordeum amphiploid with no chromosome substitution. line ht <dig> showed higher expression of the barley ap2-like gene in roots but lower than that of wheat in stems and young leaves. line ht <dig> lacks the 5hch chromosome and therefore the expression of the barley ap2-like gene was not detected in this genotype in roots, stems and young leaves . although line ht <dig> contains the 5hch chromosome, and therefore the barley ap2-like gene , its expression was strongly reduced in roots, stems and young leaves . finally, in developing spikes, the expression levels of the wheat ap2-like gene in tritordeum ht <dig> was higher than that of barley . in line ht <dig> the expression of the ap2-like gene was not detected whereas in line ht <dig> its remains at a low level during spike development ,

the ratio between the expression levels of wheat and barley ap2-like genes  in different tissues of the amphiploid tritordeum ht <dig> was calculated and compared with transcription levels in the corresponding h <dig>  and t <dig>  parentals . in all the tissues studied, the level of transcription of the wheat ap2-like gene in durum wheat  was lower than the transcription level of the barley ap2-like gene in wild barley  and therefore, the wheat/barley ap <dig> ratio was below  <dig>  in contrast, in the amphiploid tritordeum , the wheat ap2-like gene was transcribed at higher levels in all tissues, except in roots. consequently the wheat/barley ap <dig> ratio was higher in the amphiploid ht <dig> than in its corresponding h <dig> and t <dig> parentals. the wheat/barley ap <dig> ratio in the amphiploid was higher in young leaves and developing spikes than that of roots and stems .

discussion
alignments of the sequenced cdna and dna of the h. chilense lines h <dig> and h <dig>  and h. vulgare line h <dig> have shown that the internal structure of exons and introns of the ap2-like gene described in this work  is the same as that reported for the q gene in wheat   <cit> , with  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns. blast searches revealed that the sequenced genes belong to the ap <dig> family of transcription factors which includes the floral homeotic gene ap <dig>  <cit>  and aintegumenta   <cit>  involved in lateral organ development by controlling cell number and growth  <cit> . ap2-like genes are distinguished by having two plant-specific dna binding motifs called ap <dig> domains and function as key developmental regulators in reproductive and vegetative organs  <cit> . additionally, the ap2-like genes possess one microrna <dig> binding site in the 3' region . the microrna mir <dig> with 21-nucleotide non-coding rna was reported to down-regulate several arabidopsis genes in the ap <dig> subfamily  <cit> . this mir <dig> and its target sequence are highly conserved in all the genotypes aligned in figure  <dig>  with only a single change in the sequence of the t. aestivum cv chinese spring .

the conserved dna binding motifs, referred to as ap <dig> domains r <dig> and r <dig>  consist of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids respectively and the alignment with other ap2-like proteins confirmed that these domains are highly conserved, even between non-related species such as h. chilense and a. thaliana . jofuku et al.  <cit>  isolated and characterized the ap <dig> gene from a. thaliana  and reported a 53% of identity between the two ap <dig> domains r <dig> and r <dig> in the central core of the ap <dig> polypeptide. they also described the presence of an 18-amino acids conserved core region in the two ap <dig> domains with a  <dig> % of identity between them. this region is theoretically capable of forming amphipathic α-helical structures that may participate in protein-protein interactions. this α-helical structure could also participate in dna binding, perhaps through the interaction of its hydrophobic face with the major groove of the dna, as described for other proteins with similar α-helical structure  <cit> . in the study reported here, the ap <dig> r <dig> domain from h. chilense line h <dig> has 95% of identity with the corresponding amino acid sequence of that from a. thaliana described by jofuku et al. <cit> , while the conserved core region is identical. on the other hand, when comparing the ap <dig> r <dig> domain of the two species we found  <dig> % of identity in the full domain and  <dig> % in the core region. jofuku et al.  <cit>  also reported the presence of a highly basic 10-amino acids domain adjacent to the ap <dig> r <dig> domain that included a putative nuclear localization sequence kksr  <cit>  which suggested that the ap <dig> may function in the nucleus. the same domain of  <dig> amino acids is present in the sequences reported here with only a change in the second position of the nuclear localization sequence  which is conserved in all the triticeae sequences of the ap2-like proteins aligned in figure  <dig>  tang et al.  <cit>  described the amino acid sequences of the three motifs found in the ap2-like protein in rice and compared it with other ap2-like proteins from different species. we have found similar structures in the predicted ap2-like proteins of wild  and cultivated  barley .

previous experiments involving the cytogenetic analysis of aneuploids have located the q gene in the long arm of chromosome 5a of the wheat genome  <cit> . the h. chilense genome has been demonstrated to be collinear to other triticeae genomes including those of bread wheat and h. vulgare  <cit>  so that the ap2-like gene was predicted to be on chromosome 5hch of h. chilense. to confirm this, the ap2-like gene from h. chilense was amplified by pcr in h. chilense , t. aestivum cv. chinese spring, a 5hch addition line of t. aestivum cv. chinese spring, an amphiploid tritordeum , and two tritordeum lines ht <dig> and ht <dig> carrying chromosome substitutions . the results confirmed that the barley ap2-like gene is located on chromosome 5hch and that the ht <dig> substitution line  effectively lacks this chromosome.

expression of the ap2-like gene was detected in all tissues studied. the transcription level peaked in the early stages of spike development and gradually decreased with spike maturation, being very similar in all the genotypes tested when the spike was fully emerged. these results are similar to those reported by simons et al.  <cit>  who observed higher expression of the q gene in developing spikes, with a peak at the first stages of spike growth in wheat genotypes. simons et al.  <cit>  also reported lower expression in non-floral organs such as leaves and roots. jofuku et al.  <cit>  studied the transcription of ap <dig> in a. thaliana obtaining expression in floral organs  and also in non-floral organs .

we characterised the expression of the ap2-like gene in wild  and cultivated barley   and found a higher level of transcription in wild barley in roots, stems and developing spikes. simons et al.  <cit>  reported that the transcription level of the q allele, contained in bread and durum wheat cultivars, was consistently higher than that of q allele, contained in wild wheats, and this was related with differences in spike morphology. they also described that the single amino acid difference found in their predicted proteins could provide higher efficiency in homodimer formation in the q allele with respect to that of the q allele. they suggested that the q protein homodimer complex recognizes a region on its own promoter, enhancing the expression of the q allele and leading to higher levels of the q protein, and this was related to phenotypic differences in spike morphology between cultivated and wild wheats. despite this, differences between q and q can be compensated by a gene dosage effect, with  <dig>  doses of q being equal to  <dig> dose of q  <cit> .

our results with wild and cultivated barley showed that h. chilense  had higher ap2-like gene expression levels than h. vulgare . according to the model proposed by simons et al.,  <cit> , in the case of barley, the homodimer formation should be higher in h. chilense than that of h. vulgare, resulting in higher transcript levels of the ap2-like gene in h. chilense. as for wheat, differences in expression levels for the ap2-like gene in wild and cultivated barley could be responsible for phenotypic differences in spike morphology. however, in barley, the line showing higher expression levels of the ap2-like gene is h. chilense which is not the cultivated phenotype. hence, the wheat model does not entirely fit to barley, either because the mechanism in barley is different or because the mechanism is more complex than that reported by simons et al.  <cit> . in the case of wheat, the q and q alleles differ only by one amino acid while the ap2-like genes from wild and cultivated barley differ by  <dig> amino acids. therefore, differences in the spike morphology between wild and cultivated barley may not only be due to ap2-like gene expression level, but additional elements must be added to the model to explain better the contribution of the ap2-like gene to spike morphology in barley.

we have also characterised the expression of the ap2-like genes corresponding to wheat and barley genomes in tritordeum amphiploids . the comparison of the expression as wheat/barley ap <dig> ratio when both genes are expressed together in the tritordeum amphiploid  and when they are expressed separately in their parental lines, h. chilense  and t. durum , showed that the relative expression of the wheat ap2-like gene in different tissues was very constant in the amphiploid and in its durum wheat parental . however, the level of transcription of the barley ap2-like gene was  <dig>  times lower in the amphiploid than in its barley parental . this could be explained by the presence of a mechanism of regulation for the barley ap2-like gene that makes it differently expressed in the amphiploid and in barley. one of the consequences of this down-regulation of the barley ap2-like gene may be the aspect of the spike in the tritordeum amphiploid, which is more similar to that of durum wheat than that of wild barley. however, many important agronomic features of the spike in tritordeum, such as fragile rachis and non-free threshing habit are similar to h. chilense.

two tritordeum substitution lines  with free-threshing habit  <cit>  showed only expression of the wheat ap2-like gene. this was predictable for line ht <dig>  which has a 5d/5hch chromosome substitution and consequently lacks the barley ap2-like gene, but not for line ht <dig>  which carries the 5hch chromosome and therefore the barley ap2-like gene. thus in this case, expression of the barley ap2-like gene was affected also by substitution of chromosomes 1hch and/or 2hch. atienza et al.  <cit>  proposed that the presence of a homoeologous q locus on chromosome 5hch would be responsible for the non-free-threshing habit in tritordeum, and consequently the substitution of 5d/5hch in the line ht <dig> was responsible of the free-threshing habit. it was also suggested that the absence of chromosome 2hch conferred the free-threshing habit in tritordeum ht <dig>  because of the absence of a homoeologous tg locus from h. chilense that codes for tenacious glumes, in spite of the presence of q hch locus on chromosome 5hch  <cit> . kerber et al.  <cit>  and jantasuriyarat et al.  <cit>  have proposed that the action of tg during flower development directly or indirectly interferes with the q gene. the results reported from our work support this hypothesis as it appears that the absence of chromosome 2hch in tritordeum ht <dig> affects on the expression of the barley ap2-like gene, reducing its transcription to low levels.

CONCLUSIONS
the ap2-like gene from wild and cultivated barley has been characterised in this work. the ap2-like genes contain two plant-specific dna binding motifs called ap <dig> domains as does the q gene of wheat. the results confirmed that the barley ap2-like gene is located on chromosome 5hch. the expression of the ap2-like genes were studied in wheat, barley and tritordeum amphiploids showing that the level of transcription of the barley ap2-like gene in tritordeum was lower than in its barley parental. the chromosome substitutions 1d/1hch and 2d/2hch influence the expression of the barley ap <dig> in tritordeum. the results are of interest in understanding the role of the ap2-like gene in the spike morphology of cereals and in understanding the regulation of this gene in barley × wheat amphiploids. in addition, this information may be used in breeding programs for regulating the expression of ap2-like genes to modify spike characteristics and to obtain free-threshing plants.
