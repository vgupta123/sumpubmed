BACKGROUND
weaning stress can destroy the balance of intestinal microbiota in young mammals. such periods of stress may allow opportunistic pathogens to multiply and cause gastrointestinal  disorders
 <cit> . to promote growth and reduce the incidence of diarrhea, sub-therapeutic antibiotics have been widely used in pig diets
 <cit> . however, this procedure has public health consequences because of the high risk of the development of antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic bacteria, which may be then transferred to humans
 <cit> . it is therefore necessary to find ways to replace antibiotics in pig feeding strategies.

several members of lactobacillus, which is part of the normal mucosal microbiota of pigs, have been found to be good probiotics
 <cit> . lactobacillus and similar bacteria, as well as their metabolites, can control pathogens, such as escherichia coli <cit> , salmonella typhimurium <cit> , and others. selected strains of l. plantarum possess properties that make them promising candidates for probiotics in feed additives
 <cit> . however, experiments reporting the use of l. plantarum as a probiotic are limited. pieper et al. determined whether a single administration of l. plantarum dsmz 8862/ <dig> either before or at the time of weaning can affect the intestinal microbiota of pigs. the results showed that l. plantarum dsmz 8862/ <dig> has positive results on gi health
 <cit> . the effects were found to be better when the probiotics were administered at the time of weaning than when they were administered before weaning.

due to the high mortality of pigs after removing antibiotics at weaning , most farmers are reluctant to accept this option
 <cit> . in this study, we determined whether l. plantarum could replace commonly used antibiotics. we also investigated the effects of l. plantarum zj <dig> on pig growth, pork quality, gut morphology and gut microbiota.

RESULTS
inhibitory effects of l. plantarum zj <dig> culture supernatants
as shown in table
 <dig>  the culture supernatants of l. plantarum zj <dig> had strong inhibitory effects on some pathogenic bacteria, such as salmonella, escherichia coli, and listeria monocytogenes. however, probiotics such as l. fermentum, lactococcus lactis and saccharomyces cerevisiae were not inhibited by the culture supernatants of l. plantarum zj <dig>  these results showed that the strain l. plantarum zj <dig> may be a good probiotic. as shown in additional file
 <dig> figure s <dig>  the supernatants still exhibited an inhibitory effect on escherichia coli and salmonella after the ph was adjusted to  <dig> . this observation indicates that the inhibitory effect was not only due to the low ph. we also investigated the effects of two main short-chain fatty acids on bacterial inhibition. the results showed that at ph  <dig> , acetic acid and lactic acid cannot inhibit the growth of indicator bacteria .

effects of l. plantarum zj <dig> on pig growth
as shown in table
 <dig>  different treatments affected pig growth. compared to group  <dig> , other groups treated with lactobacillus or treated with both showed better pig growth. the average daily gain and food conversion ratio was higher improved in the lactobacillus-treated groups than in group  <dig>  group  <dig> showed significantly better growth performance than group  <dig>  diarrhea ratios were significantly lower in lactobacillus-treated groups than in group  <dig>  the effect of lactobacillus on pig growth varied according to dosage. the effects in group  <dig>  were more pronounced than in group  <dig>  or group  <dig> . in general, mequindox was found to improve the probiotic effects of high dosages of lactobacillus. in groups  <dig> and  <dig>  pigs were given the same dose of lactobacillus  orally. mequindox was added to the diet fed to pigs in group  <dig>  the results showed that mequindox affected the probiotic effects on pig growth, but these effects were not significant.

the effects of l. plantarum zj <dig> on growth was more pronounced in group  <dig> than in groups  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  only pigs in groups  <dig> and  <dig> were selected for further analysis.

effects of l. plantarum zj <dig> on pork quality
three pigs selected randomly from group  <dig>  and six pigs selected randomly from group  <dig> were killed for evaluation of pork quality. in group  <dig>  three pigs were killed after cessation of addition of lactobacillus to their diet. these pigs are here referred to as group 2- <dig>  the remaining three pigs in group  <dig> were killed one week after cessation of the addition of lactobacillus, and are here referred to as group 2- <dig>  as shown in table
 <dig>  the pork quality was different between antibiotic- and lactobacillus-treated pigs. the ph  and several meat texture evaluation parameters, such as hardness, stickiness, chewiness, gumminess and restoring force were significantly improved by lactobacillus  compared with antibiotic-treated pigs. more interesting is the fact that the pork quality had some changes one week after stopping lactobacillus treatment. the lightness, ∇e, drop loss , hardness, stickiness, chewiness, gumminess and restoring force of longissimus were significantly changed one week after cessation of the inclusion of lactobacillus.

histologic alterations of intestinal ileal mucosa
no features suggesting histopathology in the ilea, jejuna and duodena of antibiotic- and lactobacillus-treated pigs were observed at any time during this study. the intestinal mucosa was regularly organized in intestinal villi and crypts in both groups. the height and thickness of the villi differed across treatment groups. in the lactobacillus-treated group, the height of the villi was greater and the density was thicker than in the antibiotic-treated group. after microscopic observation, villus height and crypt depth were quantified using a leica mz16a . the ratio of villus height to crypt depth was calculated and the results are listed in table
 <dig>  the results showed that the villus height in the ilea, jejuna and duodena of lactobacillus-treated pigs  was significantly greater than that of antibiotic-treated pigs . in group 2- <dig>  the villus height in the duodena and the crypt depth in the jejuna were significantly greater one week after cessation of lactobacillus exposure.

changes in the gut bacterial community due to different treatments
dgge profiles of pcr products of the 16 s rrna gene v <dig> region from pig fecal, ileal mucosa and cecal contents revealed that the overall bacterial community was not significantly changed by lactobacillus treatment  compared to antibiotic-treated . before starting this experiment, the bacterial community of pig fecal samples were randomly distributed and varied due to individual animal differences . the patterns of dgge bands in fecal, cecal and ileal samples were similar between antibiotic- and lactobacillus-treated groups . to obtain an objective interpretation of the electrophoretic patterns of the different treatment groups, the samples were subjected to a numerical analysis based on the dice similarity coefficient, then used for cluster analysis. as shown in figure
 <dig>  the cluster analysis results indicated that the bacterial community in fecal, cecal and ileal samples did not show major changes between antibiotic and lactobacillus treatment. samples taken from different treatment groups were distributed randomly in the cluster tree.

to determine whether the l. plantarum zj <dig> colonized in pigs’ guts, most of the single dgge bands were excised for cloning and sequencing. three clones were selected randomly from each band for sequencing. the sequences were then identified using a blast search. the bacteria with highest value for each band are listed in table
 <dig>  no bands showing significant similarity to lactobacillus appeared before the start of treatment. at the end of this study, we observed two bands from fecal samples, two bands from cecal contents and  <dig> band from ileum mucosa that showed pronounced similarity to lactobacillus. no band showed pronounced similarity to l. plantarum.

the inhibitory effects of mequindox on l. plantarum zj316
as shown in figure
 <dig>  the growth of l. plantarum zj <dig> was affected by adding 50 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml, 250 μg/ml, 500 μg/ml and 750 μg/ml of mequindox, and the inhibitory effects were found to be dose-dependent. the high concentration of mequindox had strong inhibitory effect on the growth of l. plantarum zj <dig> 

discussion
results of this study showed that l. plantarum zj <dig>  isolated from infant fecal samples, had a good inhibitory effect on some pathogenic bacteria in vitro. and l. plantarum zj <dig> can significantly improve pig growth at a dose of 1 × 109 cfu/d . the probiotic effects of l. plantarum zj <dig> are consistent with those observed in previous studies. foo et al. reported that the effects of feeding lactobacillus species i-ul <dig> and their metabolites to weaned rats can improve growth
 <cit> . thanh et al. showed that metabolites produced by l. plantarum rs <dig>  ri <dig>  rg <dig> and rg <dig> strains can improve chicken growth
 <cit> .

although the effects of probiotics usage in pigs are not always consistent, beneficial effects have been documented
 <cit> . the mode of action of a given probiotic may include modulation of host microflora
 <cit> , modifications of the morphology of the intestinal epithelium
 <cit> , regulation of the host immunity system
 <cit> , and the concentration of gut scfas, such as acetate
 <cit> . in this study, we investigated the change in gut bacterial community, morphology of ileal mucosa, and the concentration of gut scfas due to treatment with l. plantarum zj <dig> 

as shown in figure
 <dig>  the bacterial communities in antibiotic- and lactobacillus-treated groups  were very similar. these results showed that the community of gut bacteria was not significantly altered by treatment with l. plantarum zj <dig>  some previous researches have shown similar results. ohashi et al. showed only a slight change in bacterial communities attributable to orally administered lactobacillus casei strain shirota 
 <cit> . su et al. also reported no remarkable changes in the overall microbial community in the hind gut after orally administrated l. sobrius s1
 <cit> . in this study, there are three possible explanations for explain this phenomenon. the first is that the pigs may have developed a stable microbiota after weaning, and this microbiota may be hard to change. although the porcine gi tract harbors a highly diverse microbial ecosystem
 <cit> , konstantinov et al. reported that once the gut microbiota has matured, it can remain stable for a long time
 <cit> . second, probiotics, known widely as beneficial bacteria and yeasts, assist in the restoration of normal levels of beneficial microorganisms without destroying the bacterial communities of the gi tract. third, the ability of this lactobacillus to colonize the gut epithelium may be low, because the bacterial species used in this experiment was isolated from infant fecal samples. dgge sequencing results verified this.  <dig> prominent dgge bands were extracted for sequencing and the results are listed in table
 <dig>  we can see that, although five bands maybe related to lactobacillus species, no l. plantarum was found in any of them. dunne et al. reported that permanent persistence of an allochthonous strain in the host gi microbiota was virtually impossible
 <cit> . l. plantarum is not the predominant lactobacillus in pigs. l. sobrius was found to be the most dominant species of lactobacillus in pigs in both pre- and post-weaning
 <cit> . previous results have also demonstrated that ingested probiotic strains do not become established members of the normal microbiota but persist only for a short time
 <cit> . there is also evidence that common probiotic strains differ in their degree of persistence
 <cit> .

villi are important components of the digestive tract. they are involved in the absorption of nutrients from the small intestine. the condition of intestinal villi and epithelial cells on the apical surface of the villi is known to be a reliable indicator of the enteral nutrient absorption of feed ingredients in chickens
 <cit>  and pigs
 <cit> . however, during post weaning, pigs commonly suffered morphologic atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, which can limit the absorption of voluntary feed intake and weight gain after weaning
 <cit> . one characteristic of an effective probiotic is to increase the villus height. scfas were considered to be the main factors for stimulating the development of intestinal mucosa
 <cit> . although the concentration of scfas was not significantly different between antibiotic- and lactobacillus-treated groups  in this study , the villus height and crypt depth both improved after treatment with l. plantarum zj <dig>  there may be other mechanisms by which probiotics can improve intestinal epithelial and villi. it has been established that the effects of probiotic bacteria may also result from soluble factors that can alter epithelial permeability
 <cit> . two soluble proteins, p <dig> and p <dig>  were purified from the culture supernatant of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg , can prevented tnf-induced apoptosis and intestinal barrier disruption in colonic epithelial cells
 <cit> . the same group also reported that the probiotic lgg can prevent cytokine-induced apoptosis in colon cells through activation the pathways of anti-apoptotic akt and protein kinase b, and inactivation of the pathway of pro-aptoptic p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase
 <cit> .

the effect of l. plantarum zj <dig> on pig growth was found to be dose-dependent. the effects of a dose of 1 × 109 cfu/d were more pronounced than those of doses of 5 × 109 cfu/d and 1 × 1010 cfu/d. this may be related to cross-talk between the probiotics and the host’s immune system. besides these anti-infective properties, probiotics also act upon the immune and inflammatory response. probiotic supplementation can enhance siga production in both rodents and humans
 <cit> . this appears to be a paradox. probiotics and nonpathogenic commensals can boost the overall siga antibody response, while siga can trigger intestinal exclusion and subsequent elimination
 <cit> . a high dose of probiotics may induce a strong immune and stress response. rodrigues et al. reported that germ-free mice colonized with s. boulardii displayed more pronounced anti-s. boulardii iga expression than un-colonized mice
 <cit> . this dose-dependent effect of probiotics has also been observed by other researchers. a change in levels of low-density lipoprotein  and high-density lipoprotein  in the blood due can be attributed to the administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis  and lactobacillus paracasei subsp paracasei  was dependent on a specific dose of  <dig> for ldl and  <dig> for hdl
 <cit> . a daily dose of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr- <dig> plus lactobacillus fermentum rc- <dig> at  <dig>  ×  <dig> has a better success of restoring and maintaining a normal vaginal flora than doses of 8 ×  <dig> and 6 ×  <dig> <cit> . there may be some other mechanisms that may explain this phenomenon. in another study, they found that low bacteria/dc  ratio better regulates the effects on dcs in vitro, suggesting that different intracellular signaling pathways become activated when bacteria are present at high doses
 <cit> . considering the dose-dependent nature of the effects of l. plantarum zj <dig>  this may be the reason why mixed treatment group  experienced a better probiotic effect than the same dose of antibiotic and probiotic administered alone . as shown in table
 <dig>  although the differences between groups  <dig> and  <dig> were not significant, the parameters used for evaluating growth performance had better values for group  <dig> than for groups  <dig> and  <dig>  these values were similar to those of the lower dose group . as shown in figure
 <dig>  mequindox inhibited the growth of l. plantarum zj <dig>  this shows that mixtures of mequindox and l. plantarum zj <dig> may affect the effective dose of l. plantarum zj <dig>  this may be why the effects of mixture group more similar to lower dose group . other researches also showed that antibiotics can affect the effects of bacteria-derived probiotics, and should be separated from antibiotics by at least two hours
 <cit> .

here, treatment with l. plantarum also improved pork quality. significant improvements were observed in group  <dig> with regards to hardness, stickiness, chewiness, gumminess, and restoring force. this may meet the nutritional needs of human consumers. until now, reports on the effects of probioitcs on pork quality have been rare; however, further study is needed.

CONCLUSIONS
the mechanism whereby l. plantarum zj <dig> improved pig growth and pork quality may not be through l. plantarum colonization and alteration of the gut bacterial community. the promotion of pig growth and pork quality may rather be related to the metabolites inhibiting the growth of opportunistic pathogens and increasing the villus height.
