BACKGROUND
the direct ex-vivo visualization and quantification of antigen-specific t cells is key to the characterisation of complex immune responses. the antigen specificity of t cells is determined by the highly specific interaction between their tcr and the cognate mhc-peptide complex. the low affinity and fast off-rate of this interaction, however, precludes its exploitation to identify specific t cells  <cit> . tetramer technology allows to circumvent this limitation, since the overall increased avidity of the mhc multimers compensates for the low affinity of the tcr-peptide/mhc interaction  <cit> . mhc class i tetramers are now indeed largely used to characterise cd8+ t cells in many basic or clinical settings  <cit> . by contrast, the generation of functional soluble peptide/mhc class ii multimers, to characterise cd4+ t cell responses, seems somewhat less straightforward. structural differences between mhc class i and class ii molecules might account for the greater difficulties to standardise the generation and production of mhc class ii tetramers. in mhc class i molecules, the α chain alone contains the complete peptide-binding groove and it is stable in the soluble form when associated with the β2-microglobulin chain  <cit> . in contrast, both the α and β chain of the mhc class ii molecules contributes to the formation of the peptide-binding site, and molecular "zippers" are necessary to guide the correct inter-chain dimerisation to stabilize the soluble recombinant αβ heterodimers. moreover, owing to the different structure of the peptide-binding groove, mhc class i and ii molecules bind peptides stably and in an homogeneous frame or unstably and in heterogeneous frames, respectively  <cit> . a variety of approaches have been used to overcome these hurdles and, in general, it appears that there does not exist a universal way to produce soluble mhc class ii molecules. most of the adopted strategies, however, generate mhc-class ii molecules endowed with little or no flexibility in terms of peptide loading. for instance, hla-dr <dig> and h2-iek have been successfully produced in bacteria  <cit> . in analogy with the production of soluble mhc class i molecules, their α and β chains are separately produced in e. coli as denatured proteins, which are allowed to refold correctly as αβ heterodimer in the presence of a single peptide. once refolded, however, the mhc class ii heterodimer cannot exchange the peptide any longer. another way to produce functional class ii tetramers relies on the generation of soluble mhc class ii αβ heterodimers engineered with a covalently linked peptide at the n-terminus of either chain, via a flexible amino acid linker of various lengths. this approach results in a homogeneous binding of the target peptides to the soluble mhc class ii heterodimer  <cit> . this strategy has been successfully applied to both human and mouse mhc class ii molecules produced in the prokaryotic as well as the eukaryotic expression system. the latter system is generally based on insect or mammalian cells, which offer the advantage over bacteria of producing proteins in native conformation and in glycosylated form. although the presence of a covalently linked peptide improves the yield of functional soluble mhc class ii tetramers, it negatively impacts on their flexibility of use, forcing the separate production of a soluble mhc ii molecule for each peptide of interest.

the generation of soluble recombinant mhc class ii molecules without covalently linked peptide has been successfully used with hla-dr* <dig> and hla-dr0* <dig> molecules  <cit> . this approach permits an increased flexibility in the usage of recombinant hla-dr monomers, which are loaded with the desired synthetic peptides by in vitro incubation.

moreover, no univocal strategy to multimerise soluble recombinant mhc class ii monomers has been yet devised. for this purpose, in fact, two main modifications are currently introduced at the c-terminus of the mhc class ii monomer. in the first approach, the extracellular domains of either mhc class ii α or β chain are linked to the ig constant region. chimeric mhc-class ii-ig molecules are generally multimerised by using protein a, which is bivalent, thus generating a tetrameric  peptide/mhc complex  <cit> . alternatively, the extracellular domains of mhc class ii α or β chain are linked to an enzymatic biotinylation site   <cit> . after labelling with biotin, tetramerisation of mhc class ii-bir monomers is accomplished by coupling with fluorochrome-conjugate streptavidin  <cit> .

we were interested in generating hla-dr* <dig> tetramers to characterise cd4+ t cell responses to several peptide epitopes derived from either environmental or tumour-associated antigens. this molecule represents one of the most frequent hla-dr allele in caucasians, being expressed in up to 20% of the population, we therefore decided to attempt the production of hla-dr* <dig> heterodimers without covalently linked built-in peptide, receptive for loading the desired peptide by incubation. since no information is currently available on functional empty tetramers made of this hla-dr allele, and given the premises outlined above, we compared two strategies for the production of soluble hla-dr* <dig> molecules in insect cells: the first generating soluble chimeric hla-dr*1101-ig molecules, the second hla-dr*1101-bir ones. we show here that it is indeed possible to produce functional hla-dr* <dig> tetramers, which can be loaded with the desired peptide after the purification of the protein. for this purpose, hla-dr*1101-bir molecules resulted superior to the hla-dr*1101-ig chimeric constructs.

RESULTS
production and biochemical characterisation of soluble hla-dr* <dig> molecules
to produce hla-dr*1101-ig and hla-dr*1101-bir molecules, the cdnas coding the extracellular domains of the hla-dr α and the hla-dr* <dig> β chain were fused in frame at the 5' end with the sequence encoding for the drosophila leader peptide bip, and at the 3' end with the acidic  and basic  leucin zipper sequences, respectively . a sequence coding a hexahistidine tag  was subsequently added at the 3' end of the hla-dr* <dig> β chain cdna .

to generate a chimeric hla-dr*1101-ig molecules, the dr α chain was linked at the 3' end with a cdna encoding for the hinge and fc fragment of human igg <dig> . to allow targeted biotin-labelling, the hla-drα-az chain was fused at the 3' end to a sequence coding a peptide recognized by the bira enzyme .

each construct was stably transfected into s <dig> drosophila melanogaster cells, that were initially grown in selective medium as bulk culture. to stabilise and optimise the production of both recombinant soluble hla-dr* <dig> molecules, bulk cultures of transfected s <dig> cells were cloned by limiting dilution, and clones producing highest quantity of soluble molecules were selected and expanded.

the hla-dr*1101-ig recombinant molecule was secreted in the culture supernatant as dimers of αβ heterodimers, owing to the presence of an inter-chain disulfide bond between two ig hinge regions, and was purified using an affinity chromatography with protein a-sepharose . the formation of the disulfide bond between two chimeric hla-drα-ig molecules was confirmed by sds-page of the purified molecules under reducing and non-reducing condition, followed by western blot analysis using anti-his tag and anti-ig antisera .

the hla-dr*1101-bir recombinant molecule was secreted as αβ heterodimer by s <dig> cells and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with the human hla-drα chain-specific mab l <dig> . noteworthy, the l <dig> mab binds a conformational epitope on hla-drα which depends on the correct folding of the αβ heterodimer  <cit> .

the immunoprecipitation of hla-dr*1101-ig and hla-dr*1101-bir molecules with the mab l <dig> shows that only a little fraction of hla-dr*1101-ig molecule can be bound by the mab, and most of the protein remains in the culture supernatant, suggesting that the secreted hla-dr*1101-ig molecules have lost the native conformation recognised by l <dig> . a second immunoprecipitation of hla-dr*1101-ig molecules from the same supernatant with fresh l243-conjugated beads did not precipitated additional soluble molecule, ruling out that the little protein precipitated was the result of insufficient amounts of mab-conjugated beads . by contrast, as shown in figure 2a, almost all the hla-dr*1101-bir molecule contained in the culture supernatant was immuno-precipitated by the l243-conjugated beads, suggesting that this type of soluble recombinant protein exhibit a correct conformation for mab binding. based on the densitometric analysis of the immunoprecipitated molecules, we assumed that only 30% of the hla-dr*1101-ig molecule present in the supernatant displayed a correct conformation, in contrast with nearly 100% of correct conformation displayed by the hla-dr*1101-bir molecule . considering that we have selected transfected s <dig> cell clones that secreted similar amounts of either soluble recombinant hla-dr* <dig> molecule , we would need to produce three times more supernatant of hla-dr*1101-ig than hla-dr*1101-bir to purify the same amount of correctly folded molecule.

to further verify the biochemical properties and stability of the two types hla-dr* <dig> molecules, we performed analytical size-exclusion chromatography on the purified proteins. figure 2c–d shows the elution profile of hla-dr*1101-ig and of hla-dr*1101-bir molecules, respectively. the hla-dr*1101-ig molecule was eluted in two peaks at elution volume of  <dig>  ml, corresponding to the void volume of the column, and  <dig>  ml, corresponding to > <dig> and  <dig> kda respectively. since the expected molecular weight for the hla-dr*1101-ig molecule is about  <dig> kda, this result suggested a high propensity of the molecule towards aggregation. moreover, a dot blot analysis could detect the dr <dig> protein in the two main elution peaks only when an anti his-tag antibody, but not when the l <dig> antibody, was utilised. these results further indicated that the hla-dr*1101-ig molecule was unstable and tended to progressively aggregate after purification. on the contrary, the elution profile of hla-dr*1101-bir  showed a single symmetric peak at an elution volume of  <dig>  ml, corresponding to the expected molecular weight of  <dig> kda of the hla-dr*1101-bir αβ heterodimer. in this case, the molecule could be detected in a dot-blot with both the anti his-tag mab and the l <dig> antibody, indicating that the molecule was correctly folded.

altogether these data indicate that the hla-dr*1101-bir exhibited superior biochemical quality to hla-dr*1101-ig molecule both in terms of tertiary/quaternary structure and stability.

peptide loading of soluble hla-dr <dig> molecules
the relative disadvantage in the production of hla-dr*1101-ig molecules could be compensated by possible peculiar physical properties displayed by this molecule in comparison with hla-dr*1101-bir molecules. we speculated in fact that, once pulsed with peptide and tetramerised, the presence of the flexible ig hinge region in the hla-dr*1101-ig construct could represent an advantage and facilitate the binding of cognate tcrs, in comparison with the more rigid hla-dr*1101-bir molecules. for this reason, we investigated the functional properties of both hla-dr*1101-ig and hla-dr*1101-bir molecules. the purified soluble hla-dr* <dig> molecules were loaded with the tetanus toxoid-derived peptide tt830– <dig> , a very well characterized promiscuous peptide binding with high affinity to different hla-dr alleles  <cit> . both purified hla-dr*1101-ig and hla-dr*1101-bir molecules were incubated for  <dig> hours at 37°c in a mild acidic buffer  in the presence of a  <dig> fold molar excess of p <dig> peptide. the efficacy of peptide loading was then evaluated by a sds-resistance assay  <cit> . the high affinity binding of a peptide to the hla-dr groove stabilize in fact the association between the hla-dr α and β chains, making in some cases the αβ heterodimer resistant to the denaturing action of sds at r.t.  <cit> . as shown in figure 3a, the "empty"  hla-dr*1101-bir molecules were denatured upon incubation in sds-containing buffer at r.t., and the drα and β chains migrated as separated chains in both boiled  and not boiled  samples. on the contrary, the binding of p <dig> substantially stabilised the hla-dr αβ heterodimer, leading to the appearance of an  <dig> kda band in the gel, corresponding to the peptide-mhc complex. unlike hla-dr*1101-bir molecules, the incubation in sds at r.t. did not induce dissociation of hla-dr*1101-ig α and β chains even when the p <dig> peptide was not added . these results indicated that the hla-dr*1101-ig molecule displayed a stronger interaction between the α and β chains, as compared to hla-dr*1101-bir molecules, precluding the quantification of peptide loading by this method.

to characterise further the loading of both soluble recombinant hla-dr* <dig> molecules with the exogenous peptides, we relied on an indirect functional assay, in which p2-loaded hla-dr* <dig> molecules were utilised in vitro to activate p2-specific cd4+ t cells. since the assay was performed in the absence of antigen presenting cells, a sub-optimal dose of phorbol myristate acetate  was added as costimulatory signal for t cells. as shown in figure 3c, both tt830–845-loaded hla-dr*1101-ig and hla-dr*1101-bir molecules were able to induce ifn-γ production by p2-specific cd4+ t cells, but not by cd4+ t cells specific for an irrelevant peptide or restricted for another hla-dr allele. these results indicated that both hla-dr*1101-ig and hla-dr*1101-bir molecules could be loaded in vitro with a peptide of interest.

staining of specific cd4+ t cells with peptide-loaded hla-dr* <dig> tetramers
we finally compared the staining capacity of both soluble hla-dr* <dig> molecules, loaded with different cd <dig> peptide epitopes. we selected for the staining experiment two p2-specific cd4+ t cell clones displaying low and high affinity for the peptide respectively, as shown in figure 4a. hla-dr*1101-ig or hla-dr*1101-bir were loaded with p <dig> peptide, multimerized and used for the staining at 4°c or 37°c, according to previous data suggesting a significant temperature effect on the interaction between the tcr and the peptide-pulsed mhc-class ii tetramers  <cit> .

as shown in figure 4b, hla-dr*1101-ig tetramers did never stain either p2-specific t cell clones at any temperature. by contrast, hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers stained both low and high affinity p2-specific t cells, although the low affinity t cells clone could only be stained at 37°c, while the high affinity one could be stained at both temperature, though with a much higher fluorescence intensity at 37°c. collectively these results indicated that hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers stain peptide-specific cd4+ t cells, and required an optimal temperature of staining of 37°c. by contrast, hla-dr*1101-ig could not stain peptide-specific t cells, despite their capacity to be loaded with peptides.

staining with hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers depends on the activation state of cd4+ t cells
in an independent series of experiments, we noticed that the staining level of cd4+ t cells by peptide-pulsed hla-dr*1101-bir molecules was consistently higher when t cells had been recently restimulated with either cognate peptide or polyclonal stimuli in the presence of pbmcs as apcs. this observation prompted a more systematic investigation of the phenomenon. this is in fact a relevant issue when considering the use of hla-dr* <dig> tetramers for ex vivo staining, since primary cd4+ t cells might display a whole range of different activation states, which in turn could affect the "detectability" of the whole peptide-specific t cell repertoire by the hla-dr* <dig> tetramers. we therefore compared the capacity of hla-dr*1101-bir tetramer to stain the high affinity p2-specific cd4+ t cell clone  <dig> at different time points from restimulation. as shown in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> t cell clone could be stained progressively less by p2-hladr <dig> tetramers moving from day  <dig> to day  <dig> post-restimulation, even though the mean fluorescence value of the cell-surface cd3-tcr complex was not substantially modified in the three conditions. this finding confirmed that the activation state of the target cd4+ t cells influences the binding of hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers to the tcr.

hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers stain polyclonal cd4+ t cells specific for p <dig> or influenza hemagglutinin ha peptides
we next verified the capacity of hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers to detect polyclonal antigen-specific cd4+ t cells. two different helper epitopes from proteins expressed by environmental pathogens were selected: tt-p <dig> and influenza hemagglutinin ha306– <dig>   <cit> , another well characterised and commonly utilised promiscuous cd <dig> epitope. pbmcs from healthy donors were stained with p2-pulsed or ha-pulsed hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers either ex vivo or at different time points after in vitro stimulation with the corresponding peptide. in line with published data  <cit> , p2- or ha-specific cd4+ t cells could be hardly detected ex vivo by hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers pulsed with either peptides , with frequencies of tetramer positive cells in the range of those obtained with peptide-unloaded  hla-dr* <dig> tetramer . after  <dig> days of stimulation in vitro with the specific peptide, however, a sizeable fraction of cd4+ t cells could be clearly detected with either peptide-pulsed-hla-dr*1101-bir tetramer , with a background staining with peptide-unloaded tetramers in the order of  <dig> – <dig> % in the two t cell cultures . the percentage of cd4+ t cells stained with the tetramers paralleled fairly accurately the percentage of cells that were able to produced ifn-γ upon in vitro stimulation with the corresponding peptide at the same time point . again, the percentage of cd4+ t cells stainable with peptide-hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers declined with time following the in vitro stimulation with the peptide, confirming at the polyclonal level what observed with t cell clones specific for p <dig>  although the decline of staining of ha-specific cd4+ t cells was more rapid than that of p2-specific ones.

hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers stain cd4+ t cells specific for the mage- <dig> tumour antigen derived m3191– <dig>  peptide
we were also interested in determining whether hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers could stain cd4+ t cells specific for the naturally processed, promiscuous p <dig> peptide derived from the mage- <dig> taa  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the p39-specific cd4+ t cell clone 2c <dig>  could be stained with p39-pulsed hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers. the affinity of this cd4+ t cell clone for the p <dig> peptide, as shown in a dose response experiment of ifn-γ production , was even lower to that of the low affinity t cell clone  <dig> for p <dig> peptide, explaining the low mfi value obtained by staining the 2c <dig>  t cell clone with p39-hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers. thus, hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers could be pulsed also with a naturally processed promiscuous tumour-derived peptide, and might prove useful in characterising naturally arising or therapeutically induced cd4+ t cells responses in hla-dr* <dig> patients with tumours expressing mage- <dig> 

discussion
we have shown the generation of a versatile hla-dr* <dig> tetramer. a single soluble recombinant protein backbone can bind at least three different promiscuous peptide epitopes, derived from environmental pathogens or tumour associated antigens, by a simple incubation step. this feature will greatly facilitate the use of this reagent for the study of cd4+ t cells responses specific for disparate antigens. the usefulness of this approach is evident also from the studies performed with hla-dr* <dig> and hla-dr* <dig> tetramers  <cit> , in which the same protein backbone was loaded with either viral or self-derived peptide. the only hla-dr* <dig> tetramers described so far are produced in e coli with a covalently linked hcv-derived peptide  <cit>  and, although functional, are limited in their use to the single peptide specificity. therefore, the production of versatile hla-dr* <dig> tetramers is extremely valuable considering the frequency of expression of this allele in the caucasian population.

it is interesting to note that the same extracellular portion of the hla-dr allele behaves differently in terms of stability when engineered with different c-terminal moieties. the presence of an ig constant domain at the c-terminus seems in fact to destabilise the "empty" hla-dr* <dig> soluble recombinant molecule significantly more than the presence of the bir sequence. the most straightforward explanation for this phenomenon holds that the extended intermolecular interactions introduced by the pairing of two ig fcs may disturb the native conformation of the chimeric hla molecules. in fact our results show that the addition of a short bir sequence at the c-terminus does not impact on the overall molecular architecture of this human hla-dr allele. evidence for a conformational alteration in the hla-dr*1101-ig molecule stems from the immuno-precipitation experiments with the anti-hla-drα chain-specific monoclonal antibody l <dig>  which recognizes a conformational epitope that is present only when the hla-drα and β chain are correctly paired  <cit> . l <dig> immunoprecipitates very inefficiently hla-dr*1101-ig molecules, whereas it efficiently binds hla-dr*1101-bir, suggesting differences in the structures of the two proteins or a masked epitope in the former. several mouse mhc class ii alleles have nevertheless been successfully produced as chimeric mhc-ig fusion proteins, with or without a linked peptide, and it is possible that hla-dr alleles other than dr <dig> might be produced in this chimeric form.

it is clear from our study that the affinity of the tcr expressed by the cd4+ t cells for the cognate peptide-hla-dr* <dig> complex will dictate the success of detection of specific primary lymphocyte population by the fluorescent tetramer. moreover, we document that the activation state of the target cd4+ t cells affects the binding of peptide-hla-dr tetramers to the cognate tcr, suggesting that biochemical pathways linked to cd4+ t cell activation modify the avidity of the tcr for the hla-dr tetramer. the fact that the binding of the tcr by the cognate peptide-hla-dr* <dig> tetramers requires an active metabolism and intact membrane trafficking is suggested further by the 37°c temperature requirement for optimal cd4+ t cell staining. collectively, these observations might help to explain why the detection ex-vivo of primary cd4+ t cells by mhc class ii tetramers seems more difficult than the detection of specific cd8+ t cells by mhc class i tetramers. further study are needed to determine whether modifying rationally the structure of the helper peptide epitope to increase its affinity for the mhc class ii allele and/or the cognate tcr, and manipulating the t cell activation pathways to increase the avidity of the tcr for hla-dr tetramers, my lead to improved ex-vivo detection of specific cd4+ t cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we report here the successful engineering of stable empty hla-dr*1101-bir tetramers. these molecules are novel powerful reagents for the study of cd4+ t cell responses towards diverse peptide antigens. our comparative study on the production of two different "empty" hla-dr* <dig> constructs, together with the evidences present in the literature, suggests that every mhc class ii isotype, and even allele, might display distinct biochemical characteristics, requiring the empiric definition of the optimal strategy for the production as functional soluble recombinant molecules.
