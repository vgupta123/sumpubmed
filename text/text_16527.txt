BACKGROUND
resistance  genes play a central role in recognising effectors from pathogens and in triggering downstream signalling during plant disease resistance  <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> r genes and  <dig>  putative r-genes present in a wide variety of plants species and conferring resistance to  <dig> pathogens  <cit> . the known r proteins can be grouped into several super-families based on the presence of a few structural motifs, including nucleotide-binding sites , leucine-rich repeat  domains, toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  domains, coiled-coil  domains and transmembrane  regions  <cit> . generally, the most prevalent r genes in plants are of the nbs-lrr type, which are divided into two sub-classes based on the presence of an n-terminal cc or tir domain  <cit> . for example,  <dig> nbs-lrr proteins are encoded by the rice genome  <cit> .

previous studies demonstrated that many r genes are clustered in plant genomes  <cit> . to date, clusters of r genes have been reported in several plant genomes, including arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , lotus japonicus  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit>  and phaseolus vulgaris  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the genome was found to encode  <dig> nbs-lrr genes, and  <dig> of these genes occurred in  <dig> clusters  <cit> . a similar phenomenon was also found in the rice genome, in which 76 % of the rice nbs-lrr genes was arranged in  <dig> gene clusters, with the others occurring as singletons  <cit> . the lengths of rga gene clusters varied from dozens of kilobases  to several megabases . for example, rga genes were tightly linked to the rpp <dig> cluster in arabidopsis, which covers less than 100 kb  <cit> , while the rga genes were distributed over several mb of the rgc <dig> locus in lettuce  <cit> . different r genes from the same cluster can confer resistance to different pathogens or to different variants of a single pathogen  <cit> . for example, the cf- <dig> gene cluster contains two cf- <dig> and cf-9b homologues that recognise the avr <dig> and avr9b effectors, respectively, in cladosporium fulvum, and contribute to the resistance against tomato leaf mould disease. other homologous genes in the cluster may serve as a reservoir of variation for the generation of r genes with new specificities .

previous research suggested that the evolution of rga clusters is usually mediated by sequence exchange, tandem duplication, segmental duplication, or gene conversion  <cit> . frequent sequence exchanges tend to homogenize the members of a gene family, like the rgc <dig> genes in lettuce  <cit> , the r <dig> cluster in solanum demissum, and the cf- <dig> cluster in tomato  <cit> . tandem and segmental genomic duplications are also important in the evolution of rga genes  <cit> , which frequently occur in nbs-lrr genes clusters, and led to the formation of the phylogenetic lineage of nbs-lrr genes in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . the evolution of the hcrvf cluster in apple was primarily dependent on gene duplication, with four hcrvf genes originating from a single progenitor gene by two sequential duplication events  <cit> . rga’s evolution by gene conversion resulted in high levels of sequence similarity, close physical clustering, and the local recombination rate  <cit> . in conclusion, the plants employed a complicated mechanism on the rga genes evolution to response the variations of pathogens.

cotton is an important crop worldwide because of its natural fibres and oil seeds. the cotton acreage in china has reached  <dig>  million hectares, which produced  <dig>  million tons of cotton in  <dig> . at present, verticillium wilt caused by verticillium dahliae is the most destructive disease of cotton, and the survival structures produced by pathogens may remain viable in the soil, persistently threatening crops, for more than 20 years  <cit> . in some years, more than 50 % of the cotton acreage is affected by verticillium wilt, significantly reducing the fibre quality and resulting in yield losses . because of its unique ecological niche in the plant’s vascular, verticillium wilt is difficult to control using fungicides, chemicals and cultivation measures  <cit> . improving genetic resistance is considered the best method to overcome verticillium wilt, and at least  <dig> different verticillium wilt resistance quantitative trait loci  have been reported in cotton . however, gossypium hirsutum appears to lack genetic resistance against v. dahliae  <cit> .

gossypium barbadense, which is a cultivated tetraploid cotton species, showed resistance or tolerance to verticillium wilt  <cit> . to date, the transcriptomes and proteomes of this verticillium wilt-resistant cotton’s responses to v. dahliae have been analysed, and phytoalexin biosynthesis and hormone signalling were found to have important roles in pathogen defense . moreover, several genes that contribute to the defence response against verticillium wilt have been reported, including gbcad <dig>  gbssi <dig>  <cit> , gbrlk  <cit> , gbstk  <cit> , gbtlp <dig>  <cit>  and gbve/gbve <dig>  <cit> .

recently, the genome sequence of a diploid cotton, gossypium raimondii, which is a verticillium wilt-resistant wild relative of cotton, was completed  <cit> . it is commonly thought that the tetraploid cotton species g. hirsutum and g. barbadense were derived from a cross between a d-genome species as the pollen-providing parent and an a-genome species as the maternal parent, and that g. raimondii is the putative d-genome parent  <cit> . previous research showed that the cotton genome encodes numerous nbs domains and that some of these genes formed gene clusters  <cit> . a transcriptome analysis showed that some rgas are involved in the defence response against v. dahliae  <cit> . however, there are no systematic studies of rga genes in the cotton genome, and the genetic resistance to verticillium wilt is unclear.

in this study, a global analysis, including sequence features, gene distribution and the evolution of rga genes in the g. raimondii genome was performed. high-throughput rna-seq was used to identify the rga genes’ transcriptome in a v. dahlia-resistant cultivar of g. barbadense and to screen for potential verticillium dahliae response loci  in the gene clusters. moreover, the association between the vdrls and verticillium wilt resistance qtls were analysed to screen the verticillium wilt-response loci in cotton.

RESULTS
analysis of rga genes in the g. raimondii genome
in this study, we focused on the rga genes in the g. ramondii genome that probably participate in the disease resistance response. in total,  <dig> rga genes were classified into  <dig> families  based on the integrated annotation of conserved motifs or domains in the g. ramondii genome  <cit> . the genome included  <dig> cc-nbs-lrr genes,  <dig> cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase  genes,  <dig> genes encoding disease resistance family proteins/lrr family proteins,  <dig> genes encoding leucine-rich receptor-like protein kinase family proteins,  <dig> genes encoding lrr protein kinase family proteins,  <dig> genes encoding lrr receptor-like protein kinase family proteins,  <dig> genes encoding lrr transmembrane protein kinases,  <dig> genes encoding lrr and nb-arc  domain-containing disease resistance proteins,  <dig> genes encoding nb-arc domain-containing disease resistance proteins,  <dig> receptor-like proteins  genes and  <dig> tir-nbs-lrr genes . a statistical analysis showed that more than half of the rga genes were located on three chromosomes, with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig>  respectively . these results indicated that the cotton genome contains many rga genes and numerous of them trend to enrich in several chromosome in cotton genome.

generally, rga genes contain conserved domains or motifs, such as nbss and lrrs. in a comparative analysis, most of the rga genes, and their encoded proteins, showed a high identity with one another , particularly rga genes on chr <dig> and chr <dig>  which shared high identities  with one another . to investigate the correlation among all rga genes, the similarity among rga genes were compared according to the chimeric sequence which connected the rga gene sequences from chr <dig> to chr <dig> in a series. interestingly, the comparison of the chimeric sequence with itself showed a high similarity apart from small similarity blocks  and self-match , indicating that many rga genes are similar in the cotton genome. moreover, the chimeric sequence segments from the same chromosome were more similar than sequence segments from different chromosomes , indicating that rga genes on the same chromosome were more closely related than genes on different chromosomes.fig.  <dig> similarity analysis of rga genes in the g. raimondii genome.  the identity matrix of all rga genes versus all rga genes. the rga genes were arranged in a series from chr <dig> to chr <dig>  “un” represents the rga genes that cannot presently be mapped to chromosomes. the identity level between each two genes was determined by blastn .  the identity matrix of all rgas encoding proteins versus all rgas encoding proteins. the identity level between each two proteins was determined using the blastp program .  homology analysis between two chimeric sequences of rga genes. the chimeric sequence was constructed by ligating the rga sequences in a series from chr <dig> to chr <dig>  the similarity blocks were determined using the blastn program  with chimeric sequences, ignoring self-matches and filtering out the similarity blocks based on the length of the smallest rga gene 



the homology clustering of rga genes also indicated that rga genes are conserved in cotton. of the  <dig> rga genes,  <dig> could be divided into  <dig> homology groups , with at least two genes in each hg, under the clustering conditions of match rate and identity being more than 33 % and 30 %, respectively. of these,  <dig> were classified into  <dig> hgs, with hg <dig> containing the minimum  <dig> genes and hg <dig> containing the maximum  <dig> genes . not surprisingly, most rga genes in the same family could be clustered into a single hg based on a conserved feature. for example, five-sixths of the rga genes in the r-ii family were clustered into hg <dig>  however, the genes of five rga gene families were clustered into multiple groups, including r-i, r-v, r-viii and r-ix. the rga genes of the r-v family were clustered into two major hgs, hg <dig> and hg <dig> , indicating that the rga gene families were not always clustered in one hg but could be clustered into different hgs. moreover, the rga genes could also be clustered into hgs using highly rigorous conditions. the  <dig> rga genes were divided into  <dig> hgs when the match rate and identity were more than 80 % for each gene . the rga genes in the same hgs are physically linked, such as  <dig> genes in the sub-hg of hg <dig>  that are closely linked in a small region that encodes  <dig> genes  . these results suggested that many rga genes, which are probably multi-copy genes in cotton, are closely linked in the cotton genome.

the phylogenetic relationship analysis of rga genes showed that most rga genes could be arranged in clades in accordance with rga gene families, such as r-ii, r-iii and r-iv . these results also corresponded to the homology clustering, showing that the major hgs in an rga gene family were arranged in a clade. for example, most r-ii family genes were clustered into hg <dig>  which was arranged in a single clade . although most of the r-v family genes could be arranged together in the phylogenetic tree, the r-v clade was split into three parts , which indicated that variation occurred in the r-v family. more persuasive evidence showed four rga gene families  which mainly contain the nbss and lrrs domain were arranged in a mixed clade . together, these results indicated that the variation in rga genes is as important as the conservation during the cotton genome’s evolution.fig.  <dig> phylogeny analyses of rga genes in the g. raimondii genome. the phylogenetic tree of rga genes was constructed using the protein sequences by the neighbour-joining method, with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. the branches of the mixed clade included four rga gene families, which are marked in purple. other conserved clades of rga gene families are rendered in different colours



many rga genes are deposited in gene clusters
in the g. ramondii genome, nearly half of the rga genes were allocated to  <dig> rgrcs . the total length of these rgrcs is ~ <dig>  mb, and there were  <dig> genes, including  <dig> rga genes. the average proportion of rga genes in rgrcs is significantly higher than in the whole genome,  <dig>  % compared with  <dig>  %. the average whole gene density was higher in rgrcs  than in the whole genome  . among these rgrcs, rgrc <dig> and rgrc <dig> are the two largest clusters, which cover ~ <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, respectively, and contained  <dig> and  <dig> rga genes, respectively . most of the rgrcs were located on chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig> . moreover, more than half of the rga genes in the eight gene families occurred in these clusters, except those of rga families r-iv, r-v and r-vii. only  <dig>  % of rga genes in the r-v family occurred in rgrc clusters . these results suggested that many rga genes occur in gene clusters in the cotton genome.fig.  <dig> the distribution of rgrcs in the g. raimondii genome. all genes encoded by the g. raimondii genome were arranged in a series from chr <dig> to chr <dig>  the ratio of rga genes was calculated in the moving window . rga gene frequencies greater than 10 % were considered rgrcs and clusters only containing  <dig> rga genes in a window, but distributed evenly, were removed. the x-axis represents the number of genes in the cotton genome and the y-axis represents the rga gene ratio in the moving window



to investigate how rgrcs are related, all of the proteins encoded by rgrcs were analysed using homology clustering. clearly, most rga genes are homologous to those clustered in the same hgs within the rgrcs. this is also true for other genes in the rgrcs that do not encode rga genes, such as rgrc <dig>  rgrc <dig> and rgrc <dig>  . the homology of most genes within rgrcs probably indicates that rgrcs undergo tandem duplications or sequence exchanges during their evolution. moreover, most proteins encoded in different rgrcs also clustered into same hgs . thus, the genes in different rgrcs are homologous, indicating that some rgrcs were probably generated from other rgrcs by segmental duplications in cotton.fig.  <dig> homology clustering of proteins encoded by genes in the rgrcs of the g. raimondii genome. the homologous relationships were determined among proteins encoded by genes in the rgrcs. the same homology groups of rga genes are linked with red lines, while other genes in the same homology groups are linked with green lines. the outer ring represents the homology groups inside in rgrcs, and the inner ring represents homology groups in different rgrcs



homology analysis of the chimeric sequence, all the rgrcs sequences connected in series from chr <dig> to chr <dig>  showed that the rgrcs was highly similar after apart from the small  and self-matching similarity blocks . in total,  <dig> high similarity blocks in the chimeric sequence were matched to each other , except for the sequences of rgrc <dig> and rgrc <dig>  and the identities of almost all the similarity blocks were close to 80 % . of the similarity blocks,  <dig> belonged to “rgrc-self-similarity”, including  <dig> blocks within rgrc <dig>  and  <dig> blocks inside in rgrc <dig> , indicating that the rgrc sequences are similar by themselves, which could be the result of tandem duplication or sequence exchange. however, parts of the similarity blocks were also found among different rgrcs, such as  <dig> matching blocks between rgrc <dig> and rgrc <dig>  and  <dig> matching blocks between rgrc <dig> and rgrc <dig>  , suggesting that some rgrcs originated by segmental duplication in cotton.

rga gene expression responses to v. dahliae infection
analysis of rna-seq data
in this study, g. barbadense cv.  <dig>  which is considered to be v. dahliae-resistant , was inoculated with the highly aggressive defoliating v. dahliae strain vd <dig>  the inoculated root samples  were collected to identify differentially expressed genes  of rgas using high-throughput rna-seq. for extremely deep sequencing, ~ <dig> million clean reads for each sample were generated, with quality control  . of these reads, ~76 % matched the reference genome of g. raimondii, including ~ <dig> million unique matched reads and ~ <dig> million multi-position matched reads .

for deg detection, the reads per exon kb per million mapped sequence reads  was calculated for each gene and filtered using the false discovery rate  and with the p-value. in total,  <dig>  degs were detected in the cotton genome at six inoculated time points, with  <dig>  genes in common at different time points ,  <dig>  degs in all inoculated time points and  <dig> genes in common ,  <dig> degs in all inoculated time points and  <dig> genes in common  . the number of up-regulated degs peaked at 48 h after inoculation, and the number of down-regulated degs gradually decreased from  <dig> to 72 h , which corresponded to the important infection time point of 48 h in v. dahliae, for the penetration of hyphae into the roots was evident about two days .

degs of rga genes
in the degs set,  <dig> rga genes were induced in cotton inoculated with v. dahliae, with  <dig> rga genes in common at six time points  . real-time quantitative rt-pcr  showed that the fold-change of degs is reliable . as with the degs in the whole genome, the degs of rga genes were also obviously induced at 48 h after inoculation . the statistical analysis of degs showed that all  <dig> rga families could respond to the v. dahliae inoculation at all of the time points, although the proportion of degs in the rlp family was relatively small . these results suggested that rga genes are involved in the cotton response to v. dahliae. the expression pattern analysis showed that rga gene families that responded to v. dahliae could be classified into the early response stage  and later response stage . in the later response stage, the number of rga genes and their expression levels were induced more obvious than in the early response stage . these results indicated that activating the later response stage is important to the resistant cotton plant’s response to v. dahliae.

many genes in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway are rga genes, which play an important role in disease resistance. in this study,  <dig> differentially expressed rga genes were induced in cotton inoculated with v. dahliae, and mapped to the plant-pathogen interaction pathway based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  annotation , including eight types of homologous genes, such as bak <dig>  fls <dig> and efr . moreover, some genes homologous to signal factors in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway, which are not rga genes, were also activated, such as protein kinases and transcription factors . in addition, genes in the phytoalexin biosynthesis pathways, including those for phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and diterpenoids, were also induced in cotton in response to v. dahliae . overall, the transcriptome results indicated that many rga genes, which probably participated in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway and regulated the defence response, were induced in cotton.fig.  <dig> degs homologous to the genes of the plant-pathogen interaction pathway. the deg genes were screened using fdr <  <dig> , p <  <dig> , and log2ratio ≥ | <dig> | at all six inoculation time points. the red box represents the differentially expressed rga genes that map to the plant-pathogen interaction pathway, the pink box represents the other degs that map to the plant-pathogen interaction pathway, and the blue and white box represents the reference kegg pathway 



degs in rgrcs
the expression pattern analysis of degs in rgrcs indicated that the rga genes were up-regulated more often than other genes in rgrcs , which suggested that rga genes were more sensitive to v. dahliae inoculation than the other genes in rgrcs. to investigate the potential rga gene responses to v. dahliae infection, highly rigorous conditions  were used for screening in this study. in total,  <dig> differentially expressed rga genes were identified as potential verticillium wilt response genes. of these genes, the proportion of potential verticillium wilt resistance genes in r-ii, r-iii and r-iv families was higher than in other families . notably,  <dig> degs occurred in  <dig> rgrcs, and  <dig> of them were distributed in the  <dig> small regions defined vdrl <dig> to vdrl <dig> . the total length of the vdrls is ~ <dig>  mb, and a minimum of  <dig> vdrls contain at least two significantly differentially expressed rga genes . a total of  <dig> differentially expressed rga genes in the vdrls belonged to the r-ii, r-vii and r-ix families , indicating that these rga genes were important to the cotton response to verticillium wilt. moreover, most vdrls were primarily distributed in the small regions of a few chromosomes, particularly chr <dig> and chr <dig>  which included seven and six vdrls respectively . a further analysis showed that the rga genes of nearly half of the vdrls encoded nb-arc domain-containing disease resistance proteins, and the rga genes of the other vdrls primarily encoded cysteine-rich rlks, leucine-rich repeat protein kinase family proteins and rlps . these results indicated that some rga genes in the rgrcs were strongly induced and a portion of them formed the vdrls that participated in verticillium wilt response in cotton.fig.  <dig> analysis of rga gene expression patterns and the screening of potential vdrls. the rga genes were arranged in a series from chr <dig> to chr <dig>  rga genes belonging to the  <dig> rgrcs are shown in red. the fold-change of log2ratio ≥ | <dig> | is marked in dotted lines. the potential vdrls were screened from rgrcs using a log2ratio ≥ | <dig> |, and having more than one infection time point up-regulated. the potential vdrls were marked with asterisks. the numbers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the boxes represent the time points  of the cotton inoculation with v. dahliae




vdrls adjacent to verticillium wilt resistance qtls
to detect the co-localization of vdrls and qtls, which had been identified to be associated with the verticillium wilt resistance in cotton , the locations of these qtls in the diploid cotton genome were analysed based on the information provided by their corresponding markers. among the  <dig> markers for these qtls,  <dig> could be located on the diploid cotton genome , and  <dig> markers were adjacent to the vdrls . in total,  <dig> vdrls were located on  <dig> chromosomes  with a physical distance of less than 3 mb to the closest qtl marker, and  <dig> of them  were less than 1 mb from the closest marker , suggesting that these vdrls were positively correlated with the verticillium wilt response. moreover, the rga genes in five vdrls  encoded nb-arc domain-containing disease resistance proteins, of which three  were close to verticillium wilt resistance qtls .fig.  <dig> correlation analysis between vdrls and verticillium wilt resistance qtls in cotton. the physical location of the vdrls and disease resistance qtls were determined by their positions in the diploid cotton genome of g. raimondii. the vdrls are marked in red and the qtls markers are labelled in blue



interestingly, six vdrls  located on chr <dig> were found close to three verticillium wilt resistance qtl markers , mucs <dig>  nau <dig> and cir <dig> . this region, in fact, extends about 10 mb, which includes rgrc <dig> and rgrc <dig>  and contains seven vdrls . the physical distance betweenvdrl <dig> and the closest marker is ~ <dig>  mb . of these seven vdrls on chr <dig>  five were enriched for the nb-arc domain-containing disease resistance genes, and two  were close to the verticillium wilt resistance qtls  . overall, these results suggested that the vdrls located on chr <dig>  which mainly encoded nb-arc domain-containing disease resistance proteins, were closely associated with verticillium wilt resistance in cotton.

discussion
plants have evolved a complicated and effective innate immune system to recognise, or respond to, many pathogenic organisms using r genes  <cit> . at present, many r genes have been cloned from plants, and they can be divided into at least five classes based on conserved structural motifs, such as nbss, lrrs and tirs  <cit> . in recent years, more than  <dig> plant genomes have been sequenced, and ~ <dig>  rga genes were predicted based on conserved structural motifs  <cit> . clearly, an analysis of the rga genes in the genome will be useful for speculating on r gene evolution and for applying rgas in cotton breeding. recently, the genome of a diploid, g. raimondii, which is a verticillium wilt-resistant wild relative of cotton, was sequenced  <cit> . in this study, all probable rga genes encoded by the g. raimondii genome were systematically analysed, and potential verticillium wilt resistance loci/genes were identified using the bioinformatics analysis of transcriptome and qtl data.

in the g. raimondii genome, at least  <dig> genes encode nbs domains and most of these genes are of the cc-nbs or cc-nbs-lrr type  <cit> . in this research,  <dig> rga genes were found in the g. raimondii genome based on an integrated annotation, and they were primarily distributed in chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig> . as expected, the rga genes showed a high similarity amongst themselves based on their conserved structural motifs, particularly when they occurred in small genomic regions of the same chromosome . in contrast, some rga genes in different families also showed similarities and were of the same phylogenetic lineage . these results may indicate that the evolution of rga genes in cotton had the dual characteristics of conservation and genetic variation, as did rgc <dig> genes in lettuce  <cit> . rga genes residing in clusters has been observed in many plant genomes . in arabidopsis thaliana, more that 71 % of the nbs-lrr genes are arranged in  <dig> clusters  <cit> , and the same characteristic is true of nbs-lrr genes in the rice genome  <cit> . as in other plants, the rga genes in the g. raimondii genome reside in clusters . previous studies have shown that the clustering of rga genes is usually caused by tandem duplications  or sequence exchanges  <cit> , which have been detected in many rga gene clusters . similar results were found in the g. raimondii genome, where most of the rga genes are homologous and linked together to form the rgrcs , indicating that tandem duplication or sequence exchanges could have occurred frequently in the evolution of rga genes or rgrcs. segmental duplication is another evolutionary mechanism in rga genes that could randomly translocate the genes in chromosomes, giving rise to a substantial number of rga genes  <cit> . this was also found in our analysis , probably suggesting that the segmental duplication could happen in the rga genes evolution. together, these results probably indicated that tandem duplication, sequence exchange, and segmental duplication are important to the evolution of rga genes and rgrcs.

verticillium wilt is the most destructive disease in cotton, and there are no effective methods to prevent this disease at present. although improving genetic resistance is the direct method to combat verticillium wilt, it has not been successful in g. hirsutum, which accounts for more than 90 % of the total cotton acreage in the world, because of the lack of genetic resistance  <cit> . g. barbadense is considered to be a resistant species, and many studies regarding verticillium wilt resistance have been reported . recently, a transcriptome analysis showed that some rga genes were induced in g. barbadense inoculated with v. dahliae  <cit> , indicating that the rga genes contribute to the defence response in g. barbadense. in this study, the rga genes in the cotton response to v. dahliae were analysed using rna-seq. to overcome problems caused by the complicated genome and high identities between rgas, an extremely deep rna-seq strategy was applied in this study to produce reliable deg screening . the results showed that more degs were identified in this study compared with previous studies on g. barbadense infected with v. dahliae   <cit> , which suggests that deep sequencing is useful for the transcriptome analysis of cotton and particularly for the analysis of homologous genes. however, it must point out that the degs also possibility reflect diurnal or developmental regulation for various times inoculated samples compared with a single mock-inoculated sample in our experiment. qrt-pcr validation between the inoculated samples and their corresponding mock-inoculated controls is necessary for screening the verticillium wilt response genes.

plant genomes encode many rga genes, and some of these genes are transcriptionally activated in the plant’s defence against pathogens . investigating the degs revealed that several hundred rga genes, which belonged to different gene families, were induced in our experiment , and many of them were homologous to genes in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway , which suggests that these rga genes could participate in the defence response against verticillium wilt. moreover, the rga genes strongly responded from  <dig> to 72 h , which is an important infection stage in v. dahliae . these results suggest that the expression of rga genes is important to the defence response of verticillium wilt resistance.

rga genes that are distributed in gene clusters usually act as genetic resistance sources in plants  <cit> . in the g. raimondii genome, the rga genes in the rgrcs were also induced, which most likely indicated that the rga genes formed clusters that were involved in verticillium wilt resistance , similar to the resistance clusters in many other plants . in this study, at least  <dig> potential vdrls, which included  <dig> rga genes, were found to be strongly induced in g. barbadense, and half of these loci were on chr <dig> and chr <dig> , which is consistent with a previous finding that vdrls were mainly distributed on chr <dig> and chr <dig> in upland cotton  <cit> . among these vdrls, half were enriched for nb-arc domain-encoding rgas , which are involved in a variety of processes, including apoptosis, transcriptional regulation and effector-triggered immunity  <cit> . moreover, some rgas that clustered in several vdrls are homologous to pattern recognition receptors , which suggests that the vdrls, like cysteine-rich rlks and receptor-like proteins, participate in pamp-triggered immunity  <cit> . these results suggested that the mechanisms of cotton resistance to v. dahliae are complicated and require the participation of multiple rgas or loci for cotton verticillium wilt resistance.

to date, at least  <dig> different verticillium wilt resistance qtls have been reported in cotton . with the bioinformatics analysis of the rga’s distribution and expression after v. dahliae inoculation, at least  <dig> vdrls were regarded as potential verticillium wilt-response loci . interestingly, a correlation analysis showed that  <dig> vdrls were less than 3 mb  from the closest verticillium wilt resistance qtl, and  <dig> were of the nb-arc gene cluster type . an association analysis between disease resistance qtls and nbs genes found that at least  <dig> nbs-encoding genes were adjacent to disease resistance qtls in cotton  <cit> , and there were similar results in other crops . six of the vdrls adjacent to verticillium wilt resistance qtls were located on the short region of chr <dig> , which again indicated that verticillium wilt resistance qtls clustered on chromosome d <dig> in cotton  <cit> . these results will be beneficial for understanding the vdrls in cotton and cloning the verticillium wilt resistance gene.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, the characteristics of rga genes encoded in the g. raimondii genome were analysed, including the sequence structure, gene distribution and evolution. the g. raimondii genome encodes  <dig> rga genes, of which most are highly similar and could be clustered in hgs. nearly half of the rga genes occurred in  <dig> rgrcs. interestingly, many rga genes are homologous, which results in most rgrc sequences having a high similarity, indicating that sequence exchanges and tandem duplications frequently occurred in the evolution of rga genes or rgrcs. moreover, the similarity among different rgrcs suggests that some clusters may have evolved by segmental duplication. the rna-seq analysis of the resistant cultivar g. barbadense showed that approximately half of the rga genes were significantly induced by v. dahliae infection, and the portion of the rga genes that formed  <dig> vdrls in the rgrcs were most likely involved in the verticillium wilt response. a correlation analysis found that  <dig> vdrls were adjacent to verticillium wilt resistance qtls, which strongly suggested that these loci respond during verticillium wilt resistance in cotton.
