BACKGROUND
the isoprenoid  pathway is one of the most important and well-studied biosynthetic pathways in plants. it involves cross-talk between the cytosolic mevalonate  and plastidial 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  pathways, to give rise to isopentenyl-diphosphate , the c <dig> building block required for the synthesis of a diverse group of natural products that perform numerous biochemical functions in plants. the main branch of the isoprenoid pathway leads to the synthesis and accumulation of carotenoids, c <dig> terpenoid compounds formed by the condensation of eight isoprene units, within plastids  <cit> . carotenoids are important natural pigments found in all plants and algae, in many bacteria and fungi, as well as in some animals. in photosynthetic organisms, carotenoids are always present within chloroplasts associated with the light-harvesting complexes of photosystems, where they gather light energy and transfer it to the chlorophylls, in addition to contributing to protection of the photosynthetic apparatus from photooxidation  <cit> . chromoplast synthesized carotenoids accumulate during fruit ripening resulting in dramatic changes in tissue pigmentation. carotenoids also play an essential role in attracting insects and herbivores that act as floral pollinators and seed dispersion vehicles, including the consumption of plant organs such as ripe fruits as food by humans. when carotenoid-rich foods are ingested, carotenoids are assimilated, metabolized, transported in the plasma by lipoproteins, and stored in various tissues  <cit>  where they display biological activities including acting as antioxidants and free-radical scavengers, reducing the risk of certain types of cancers, and promoting immune responses. in addition, some carotenoids  are precursors of vitamin a, an essential nutrient for humans  <cit> . carotenoids can undergo multiple structural modifications, namely, cyclization, hydroxylation, and epoxidation, yielding the great variety of carotenoids found in nature comprising more than  <dig> compounds  <cit> .

increasing interest is devoted to carotenoid content and composition of food crops because of their important roles in human health  <cit> . cultivated watermelon  is important in the diets of people throughout the world. more than 6% of the world's total area devoted to vegetable production is used for watermelon production  <cit> . throughout the mediterranean basin, watermelon is considered an extremely important agricultural crop, with over  <dig> tons produced in  <dig> at a production value of approximately $ <dig> billion us  <cit> . the ripening of watermelon fruit is a highly regulated process because color, flavor, aroma, and texture change in a coordinated manner. one of the most noticeable characteristics of watermelon ripening is the dramatic increase in carotenoids. the change in pigmentation is caused by synthesis and accumulation of lycopene within the chromoplasts in watermelon fruit resulting in their characteristic red coloration.

to maximize the health-promoting benefits of carotenoids through increased consumption, characterization of carotenoid synthesis and accumulation in important food crops such as watermelon is essential. understanding the molecular and genetic components controlling the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is fundamental for targeted breeding aimed at improving carotenoid-producing watermelon cultivars  <cit> .

in the past decade, most carotenoid biosynthesis genes in plants have been identified  <cit> . identification of the cauliflower or  gene further indicates the importance of providing a sink for newly synthesized carotenoids in determining net accumulation  <cit> . progress in elucidating the mechanisms that control carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation in plants have been recently achieved using climacteric  and non-climateric  fruits as models  <cit> , though limited information is available for other species including watermelon.

different strategies to control carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation in plant tissues have been reported  <cit> . during flower color development and fruit ripening, transcriptional regulation of carotenoid gene expression has been shown to be a major mechanism by which the biosynthesis and accumulation of specific carotenoids are regulated. classic examples are found in tomato and pepper , where the synthesis and accumulation of specific carotenoids parallel increased expression of precursor  carotenogenic genes and reduced expression of downstream  genes of the accumulating carotenoids  <cit> . the mechanisms of these transcriptional control systems remain poorly understood. post-transcriptional regulation at the enzymatic level also plays a role in controlling carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation  <cit> . metabolic turnover of carotenoids by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases  not only produces important signalling and accessory apocarotenoid molecules, but also helps to maintain the steady-state level of carotenoids in plant tissues. expression of ccds has been found to negatively regulate carotenoid accumulation  <cit> . a body of evidence has shown that oxidative cleavage of carotenoids is induced under environmental stresses  <cit> . light and circadian rhythm have been shown to alter the expression of nearly all mep genes and several carotenoid synthesis genes  <cit>  as well as carotenoid catabolism genes  <cit> . developmental cues also play important roles in conferring metabolic turnover of carotenoids  <cit> . in addition, altered plastid biogenesis leading to increased plastid compartment size was associated with elevated chlorophyll and carotenoid levels in hp  mutants  <cit> .

a system analysis approach for transcriptome and metabolic data is presented here to identify putative transcription factors that may impact carotenoid accumulation during watermelon fruit ripening. the pattern of synthesis and accumulation of carotenoids and the expression of carotenoid- and isoprenoid-related genes  has been analyzed in fresh watermelon during fruit development and ripening in order to clarify the factors influencing accumulation of these bioactive molecules and to identify key regulators and molecular targets for crop improvement.

RESULTS
an integrative study combining carotenoid profiles and whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed to gain insight into novel genes associated with and possibly regulating the synthesis and accumulation of carotenoids in watermelon plastids during fruit development and ripening. analysis of carotenoids in the flesh of watermelon fruits at four successive stages of fruit development and ripening corresponding to the white, white-pink, pink and red-ripe color of the fruit flesh , are shown in table  <dig>  phytoene, phytofluene  <dig>  phytofluene  <dig>  ζ-carotene  <dig>  cis-lycopene, trans-lycopene, β-carotene, γ-carotene and lutein were identified. other carotenoids such as ζ-carotene, cis-neurosporene, α- and δ-carotene, zeaxanthin and violaxanthin were not detected [lod  =  <dig>  μg g- <dig> fresh weight ; loq  at any of the four stages analyzed.

carotenoid μg g
- <dig> 
the amount of carotenoids was measured at four stages of fruit ripening: white; white-pink; pink and red-ripe stages. values are expressed as μg g- <dig> fw. each value represents the mean result from triplicate ± sd. data were submitted to one-way analysis of variance , values marked with different capital letters indicate statistically significant difference between ripening stages for a given carotenoid .

fw, fresh weight; sd, standard deviation; car, carotenoid; acy, acyclic; cy, cyclic; nd, not detectable. italic formatting identifies dimentionless ratios.

the amount of each identified carotenoid varied significantly during fruit ripening , with the exception of phytofluene  <dig> and lutein that remained low in all ripening stages. as expected, the total amount of carotenoids  progressively increased during fruit ripening from  <dig>  μg g- <dig> fw to  <dig>  μg g- <dig> fw at the white and red-ripe stages, respectively. trans-lycopene contributed most to this increase, while the cis isomer, although increasing in proportion similar to trans, represented only  <dig> % of the total carotenoid content from the white-pink  to the red-ripe stage. in terms of color, at the white stage, there is no difference between the inner peel  and the placenta  , while, at the white-pink stage, the flesh tissue started to turn red  due to lycopene accumulation. trans-lycopene was, in fact, detected at a very low concentration  at the white stage and predominated  at the white-pink stage of ripening. the highest rate of change in accumulation of trans-lycopene was observed in the transitional phase between the white-pink and the pink stage where it reached  <dig>  μg g- <dig> fw, ~ <dig>  times higher than that of the previous stage. trans-lycopene increased less than two-fold  by the next  stage. these results confirm our earlier studies, in which lycopene content of the same cultivar ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  μg g- <dig> fw from the white to the red-ripe stages of ripening  <cit> . in addition, the amount of lycopene measured at the red-ripe stage concurs and falls within the range  reported for ripe red-fleshed commercial cultivars by perkins-veazie et al.  <cit> .

at the white stage, lutein, even if present in a very low amount , was the most abundant carotenoid in the watermelon flesh, contributing to 40% of total carotenoids. phytofluene  <dig> and  <dig> were the only acyclic carotenoids detectable at this stage although in amounts close to the loq. starting from the white-pink ripening stage the acyclic carotenoids phytoene and phytofluene  <dig> increased gradually reaching their maximum  in red-ripe fruit. ζ-carotene  <dig> showed its highest concentration  in fully ripe watermelons but it was detectable only from the pink stage. phytofluene  <dig>  ζ-carotene  <dig>  cis-lycopene and lutein remained at very low levels throughout watermelon fruit development and ripening. in photosynthetic tissues lutein plays a critical role in light-harvesting complex assembly and function, and in photoprotection of photosystems  <cit> . it is the most abundant carotenoid in the chloroplasts and often accounts for >50% of the total carotenoid pool. the small amounts of lutein found in the non-photosynthetic tissues of the flesh of the young, not yet fully developed, watermelon fruit, could have a role in the protection of the plastid membranes from oxidative stress.

the content of β-carotene was at low levels until the red-ripe stage when β-carotene content was four times higher than the previous stage, representing  <dig> % of total carotenoids. at the white-pink ripening stage the amount of γ-carotene was at least  <dig> times higher than that of β-carotene, but in subsequent stages their contents became similar. tadmor et al.  <cit>  reported that red watermelons generally have any of the three following carotenoid profiles: 1) high levels of lycopene and small amounts  of β-carotene; 2) accumulation of mostly lycopene and significant  β-carotene and 3) lycopene exclusively, with no detectable β-carotene. the first carotenoid pattern seems to best characterize the dumara cultivar at the red-ripe stage suggesting that mature fruit of this cultivar retain at least some lycopene β-cyclase activity.

the expression profiles of  <dig>  genes, among the  <dig>  predicted in the watermelon genome assembly  <cit> , were generated from trascriptome characterization of watermelon ripening fruits of the dumara cultivar by illumina rna sequencing. searching the resulting transcriptomics data for genes involved in the pathways related to carotenoid metabolism  , we identified  <dig> sequences coding for putative proteins with an e-value lower than 1e- <dig> and a minimal reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads  value of  <dig> in at least one of the four ripening stages. this threshold was arbitrarily chosen to filter the sequences with very low counts which may represent estimates of transcript abundance that are too unreliable for inclusion in differential gene expression analysis . among the identified sequences,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in the flesh tissue during fruit development and ripening  .

of the  <dig> sequences thought to be involved in the upstream mva pathway leading to isopentenyl-diphosphate  and dimethylallyl diphosphate  biosynthesis, only one  coding for a putative acetyl-coa acetyltransferase  <dig>  was differentially expressed during watermelon ripening. changes in its expression levels in rpkm, are reported in figure  <dig> 

acat <dig> catalyses the condensation of two acetyl-coa subunits to form acetoacetyl-coa thus directing this central metabolite to the mva pathway. interestingly acat <dig> mrna expression was up-regulated approximately three-fold during watermelon ripening suggesting that this enzyme may divert the metabolic flux of acetyl-coa from the biosynthesis of fatty acids and amino acids toward the synthesis of isoprenoids. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase  is a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway and catalyses the formation of mva from 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coa . it is a highly regulated enzyme, being subjected to transcriptional, translational, and post-translational control  <cit> . although a sequence  coding for a putative hmgr <dig> is differentially expressed in ripening watermelon fruits  , it was not taken into account in this study having rpkm far below our defined minimal value of  <dig>  however, the very low expression of hmgr <dig>  in ripening watermelon fruits supports the assertion that the conversion of hmg-coa to mva is the rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of sterols and other isoprenoids  <cit> .

two different genes  encoding putative isopentenyl-diphosphate δ-isomerases  were identified. these enzymes convert the relatively un-reactive ipp to the more-reactive electrophile dmapp. both genes were stably expressed during watermelon ripening but idi <dig> expression was considerably higher than that of idi <dig> . in arabidopsis thaliana  heynh. idi <dig> and idi <dig> are expressed in all organs, with idi <dig> less abundant than idi <dig>  examination of green fluorescent protein fusions established that idi <dig> is mainly located in the plastids, whereas idi <dig> is in the mitochondria. both proteins are also present in the cytosol as a result of their translation from naturally occurring shorter transcripts lacking transit peptides  <cit> .

three sequences were found to be associated with putative enzymes involved in the ipp down-stream mva pathway . of these, two  were differentially expressed during watermelon ripening . the expression of cla <dig>  coding for a putative geranyl-diphosphate synthase , was strongly inhibited as soon as the ripening process started. this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of dmapp in the presence of ipp into geranyl-diphosphate  which is further converted into farnesyl diphosphate  in the presence of another molecule of ipp by farnesyl diphosphate synthase . it is well established that cytosolic ipp, which is then isomerized to dmapp by the activity of idis, contributes to the formation of functional plastidic isoprenoids  <cit> . down-regulation of cla <dig> could determine a shift of the mva produced ipp towards carotenoid biosynthesis. squalene synthase  catalyses the head-to-head condensation of two fpp molecules to form squalene, the first committed step in sterol biosynthesis, and as such was not considered further here.

in plants, ipp and dmapp entering in the biosynthesis of carotenoids are mainly synthesized by the mep pathway in the plastids  <cit> . in this work  <dig> sequences were found that are likely to be involved in the up-stream pathway leading to ipp and dmapp biosynthesis, and  <dig> were differentially expressed during watermelon fruit development and ripening . 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase  has been shown to catalyze one of the rate-limiting steps of the mep pathway  <cit> . it generates 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate  by the transketolase-type condensation of pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and is also involved in the biosynthesis of thiamine and pyridoxal  in bacteria and higher plants  <cit> . therefore dxs appears to play a key role linking isoprenoid and vitamin biosynthesis. four genes  were found to encode for putative dxs isoforms. most enzymes of the mep pathway are encoded by single-copy genes in flowering plants, whereas dxs is typically encoded by a small gene family  <cit> . the genes of the dxs family display differential expression during plant development and in specific organs, suggesting a non-redundant function and possibly a role in production of particular isoprenoids  <cit> . with the exception of cla <dig>  whose expression did not vary during ripening , the other three sequences were differentially expressed  and induced during watermelon fruit ripening . this is in agreement with what was found in tomato and pepper fruits  <cit> . in tomato, the highest level of dxs transcripts was detected at the breaker stage, and then decreased during later ripening  <cit> . dxs mrna was found to be most abundant in young arabidopsis chs <dig> mutant, maize  and peppermint  leaves suggesting that its activity is of critical importance at the early stages of leaf and chloroplast development and confirming its organ and tissue specificity  <cit> . the fact that multiple watermelon dxs genes are induced during ripening suggests a predominant role of members of this family in driving fruit carotenoid accumulation.

dxp is converted to mep by the enzyme dxp reductoisomerase  encoded in watermelon by the gene sequence cla <dig> whose mrna expression profile remained stable during fruit ripening . mep is subsequently converted into ipp and dmapp by the consecutive action of five independent enzymes: 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidyltransferase , 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase , 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol  <dig> -cyclodiphosphate synthase , 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase , and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase . isomerization of ipp and dmapp is catalyzed by the two isomerases idi <dig> and idi <dig> . the sequences cla <dig>  cla <dig>  cla <dig> and both cla <dig> and cla <dig> coding, respectively, for the putative enzymes mct, mds, hds and hdr all showed a significant increase in expression levels during ripening at least up to the pink stage . cla <dig> encoding for a putative cmk, was stably expressed throughout watermelon fruit ripening .

geranylgeranyl diphosphate , the precursor in the synthesis of all plastid isoprenoids, is generated by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase  that catalyses the condensation of three ipp and one dmapp units. the expression of cla <dig>  encoding for a putative ggps, increased  in the transition between the white and the white-pink stage of ripening, in agreement with the higher rate of synthesis of lycopene between these transitional phases, then progressively decreased at the pink and the ripe-red stages. in other fruits such as mango , ggps levels were stable throughout the fruit life  <cit> .

since ggpp is a common precursor for the synthesis of phyllochinones, tocopherols, plastoquinones, chlorophylls, gibberellins and carotenoids the expression profiles of genes which may affect carotenoid biosynthesis through competition with phytoene synthase  for ggpp were also analyzed . in watermelon, two sequences  were found to encode putative geranylgeranyl diphosphate reductases  that convert ggpp to phytyl diphosphate in the tocopherol and chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways. both were differentially regulated during watermelon ripening . while, the expression of cla <dig> and cla <dig>  coding for ent-kaur-16-ene synthase  and prenyl transferase , diverting the ggpp flux towards the synthesis of gibberellins and plastoquinones, respectively, were stably maintained low during watermelon fruit ripening  presumably to guarantee the synthesis of these fundamental metabolites.

of the  <dig> sequences associated with putative enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway,  <dig> were differentially expressed during watermelon ripening . as in tomato, two members of the psy gene family were identified and with different expression patterns. cla <dig> expression level was very low at the white stage but increased sharply as the fruit matured, peaking at the pink and then decreasing at the red-ripe stage. a similar expression profile of a putative psy- <dig>  was described by guo et al.  <cit>  in watermelons of the inbred line  <dig>  in contrast, cla <dig> maintained low expression throughout fruit development and ripening, decreasing further in the later stages. the expression profiles are similar to those of tomato psy- <dig> and psy- <dig>  respectively. psy- <dig> is induced in ripening tomato fruit in association with elevated lycopene accumulation. psy- <dig>  on the other hand, is low in fruit and highly expressed in leaf  <cit> . therefore it appears that the psy encoded by cla <dig> has a function similar to tomato psy- <dig> whereas the product of cla <dig> is similar to psy- <dig> 

the expression level of phytoene desaturase , carotene cis-trans isomerase  and ζ-carotene desaturase  genes increased during fruit development and ripening up to the pink stage and then remained constant . it is well known that pds catalyzes the desaturation steps, sequentially producing phytofluene and ζ-carotene  <cit>  from phytoene. zds with crtiso are both involved in the steps which sequentially convert  <dig> '-di-cis-ζ-carotene to pro-lycopene  and to all-trans-lycopene. isaacson et al.  <cit>  found that the function of crtiso paralleled that of the  <dig> '-di-cis-ζ-carotene desaturase  to convert  <dig> ,9'-tri-cis-neurosporene to 9'-cis-neurosporene and  <dig> ,7',9'-tetra-cis-lycopene to all-trans-lycopene. in tomato, isaacson et al.  <cit>  reported that deletions in the promoter region and coding region of crtiso resulted in two different color mutants of tangerine accumulating pro-lycopene and ζ-carotene instead of all-trans-lycopene. this strongly suggests that watermelon crtiso mutations might also cause the salmon yellow or orange mutation that accumulates pro-lycopene and ζ-carotene as major fruit carotenoids  <cit> .

lycopene β-cyclase  and lycopene ϵ-cyclase  expression levels were low at the white stage and did not change during watermelon ripening . lcyb is one of the crucial enzymes for carotenoid biosynthesis. lcyb along with lcye bring about the cyclization of lycopene. activities of both of these enzymes make α-carotene via δ-carotene, while activity of lcyb alone leads to formation of β-carotene via γ-carotene  <cit> . in tomato, the down-regulation of this gene may generate a blockade downstream, leading to the accumulation of lycopene in red-ripe fruits  <cit> . the low expression level of lycb mrna that we found in the dumara cultivar, may permanently maintain low metabolic flux toward cyclic carotenes and xanthophylls during ripening. in contrast to tomato, during watermelon ripening no chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition occurs, rather chromoplasts originate from the differentiation of proplastids. therefore constant synthesis of β-carotene and lutein, which are present in significant quantities in the purified chloroplasts of unripe tomatoes  <cit> , is not required in watermelon fruits. however, a dramatic reduction in the expression of lcyb and β-carotene hydroxylase gene , although with differences in the amount of transcript level variation, was recently reported in red-fleshed “zaohua” and pink-fleshed “96b41” watermelon varieties 20–30 days after pollination and related to lycopene accumulation during ripening  <cit> , suggesting that the regulation of lcyb is influenced by watermelon genotype. a gradual decrease of lcyb, which resulted undetectable at the over-ripe stage, was also reported by guo et al.  <cit>  during watermelon inbred line  <dig> ripening.

two sequences  coding for putative chyb isoforms were identified with a similar but quantitatively different expression pattern . the high expression levels of downstream genes chyb and zeaxanthin epoxidase , whose expression increased early during watermelon fruit ripening and remained stable over time, may help maintain the amounts of γ- and β-carotene at low levels as intermediate metabolites for other compounds. similarly the lack of either zeaxanthin and violaxanthin, products of chyb and zep activities, in the watermelon carotenoid profiles at any stage of ripening may be due to their rapid catabolism by dioxygenases   <cit> .

two members of 9-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenase family, nced1s , involved in the cleavage of 9-cis-violaxanthin or 9-cis-neoxanthin to form c <dig> epoxy-apocarotenal and xanthoxin , a precursor of aba  <cit> , increased during watermelon ripening with a different expression profile. the transcript cla <dig> reached the peak of expression at the pink stage whereas the transcript cla <dig> peaked at the white-pink stage and then slightly declined at the pink and red-ripe stages . in addition, one member of ccd family , preferentially involved in volatile compound production from different carotenoid substrates  <cit> , was found to increase, reaching the highest values in the pink and red-ripe fruit ripening stages . now these data suggest that a complex balance between up-regulation and down-regulation of genes belonging to different central pathways of plant cell metabolism generate a flux of metabolic precursors towards lycopene synthesis during watermelon fruit development and ripening. concurrently, a constitutive low expression level of lycopene cyclase genes creates a blockade downstream, leading to the accumulation of lycopene and demonstrates differential and coordinate regulation of such genes.

in tomato, many regulatory factors operating in the fine control of the isoprenoid pathway have been elucidated  <cit> . many genes  have been shown to encode transcriptional regulators affecting the expression of other genes responsible for ripening phenotype, including isoprenoid biosynthesis and accumulation  <cit> . we screened the transcript set of watermelon for similarity against the known mrna sequences of the above-mentioned tomato transcription factors by blast using an e-value threshold of ≤1e −  <dig>  nineteen sequences encoding putative transcription factors with a rpkm value ≥ <dig> in at least one of the four watermelon ripening stages assayed were identified. among these, only  <dig> were differentially expressed in the flesh tissue during fruit development and ripening  .

genes were identified through illumina sequencing technology in watermelon fruit using two biological replicas. in bold are indicated the genes differentially expressed during watermelon ripening with a fdr  ≤  <dig> .

*according to swiss-prot database.

two genes  were related to the solanum lycopersicum mads-box transcription factor ripening inhibitor , a member of the sepallata  subfamily. both sequences were constitutively expressed at high levels during watermelon ripening, with average rpkm values of 339 ±  <dig>  and 299 ±  <dig> , respectively. mads-box genes are normally associated with floral development, but rin-mads is an essential regulator of tomato fruit ripening. rin-mads controls tomato softening and ethylene production by the direct transcriptional regulation of cell-wall-modifying genes and acs  genes, respectively. in addition, recently, it has been demonstrated to interact with promoters of many genes involved in the major pathways associated with ripening, including carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation, to both initiate and maintain their expression throughout the ripening process  <cit> . rin-mads protein and mrna are first detected slightly before the breaker stage and maintained throughout ripening  <cit> . in ailsa craig tomato fruits, expression of lerin-mads increased 16-fold during ripening  <cit> . similarly, expression of a strawberry  lerin-mads homologous gene, identified by screening of a strawberry fruit cdna library with a tomato lerin-mads cdna, was enhanced during ripening, suggesting that transcriptional control of ripening is conserved among climacteric and non-climacteric species  <cit> . the identification of watermelon lerin-mads homolog genes, expressed at high levels throughout the process of fruit ripening, further supports this hypothesis.

similarly, neither of the two sequences  homologous to mads-box transcription factor tomato agamous-like  <dig> , was differentially expressed during watermelon fruit ripening  . the expression of both had average values of 88 ±  <dig> rpkm and 65 ±  <dig> rpkm, respectively. in tomato tagl <dig> is induced in the early stages of carpel development and later at the onset of ripening, suggesting it is involved in both processes. its expression increases during ripening, peaking at the orange stage of fruit development, possibly in relation to ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . part of the tagl <dig> activity in tomato fruit ripening is, in fact, exerted through regulation of the acs <dig> gene coding for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis  <cit> . ethylene biosynthesis is not essential for watermelon fruit ripening, although varying patterns of ethylene production have been reported in non-climacteric fruits, including watermelons  <cit>  and may explain in part the difference in tagl <dig> expression profiles between tomato and watermelon. the early tagl <dig> activity in tomato was shown to be related to expansion of the carpel  <cit> . the large size of watermelon and the constitutive expression of the homologous genes may reflect activity related to the exceptional size of the mature watermelon fruit. in tomato, tagl <dig> requires rin-mads activity for the induction of lycopene accumulation in ripe fruit. in watermelon, both rin and tagl <dig> are expressed at a substantial level during ripening supporting the idea they have a role in carotenoid synthesis and accumulation.

tdr <dig> is another member of the mads box transcription family, belonging to the squamosa  subfamily, whose expression pattern suggests a possible role during tomato fruit ripening  <cit>  in an ethylene-independent manner  <cit> . although three sequences were identified in watermelon with a high similarity to tdr <dig> , all were expressed at a very low level  and, for this reason, were not considered further. tdr <dig>  hence, seems not involved in isoprenoid accumulation during watermelon fruit ripening, but it may influence different biosynthetic pathways in other non-climacteric fruits. a tdr <dig> ortholog was, in fact, recently shown to influence anthocyanin biosynthesis during bilberry ripening  <cit> .

colorless non ripening  encodes a transcription factor of the squamosa promoter-binding protein family . it likely controls expression of squa mads box genes  by interacting with their promoters. tomato mutants in this gene show pleiotropic non-ripening phenotypes, including a mealy and pale pericarp  <cit> . five related sequences were identified in watermelon . two  exhibited a low and stable expression pattern with average rpkm values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , respectively. the other three sequences  were differentially expressed during watermelon fruit ripening showing a sharp reduction already in early ripening . in liberto and ailsa craig wild-type tomato fruits cnr was transiently expressed at the breaker stage of ripening  <cit> . cnr is necessary to induce ripening-associated increases in respiration and ethylene synthesis in tomato and other climacteric fruits, in non-climacteric fruits its role remain unclear. the down regulation of the putative cnr genes during watermelon ripening suggests it may act as a regulator of isoprenoid accumulation, but with mechanisms different by those operating in climacteric fruits.

another ripening regulator that pleiotropically controls many aspects of tomato ripening is non-ripening . cla <dig> showed a high similitude with nac-nor. in watermelon the expression level of cla <dig> did not significantly change during fruit ripening  suggesting that nac-nor protein is not limiting in watermelon fruit ripening as it is in tomato  <cit> .

in tomato apetala2a  transcription factor, a member of the apetala2/ethylene response factor  superfamily, influences fruit ripening via regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling  <cit> . in tomato, rin-mads, nac-nor and cnr positively regulate siap2a expression which is, in turn, a negative regulator of ripening and ethylene production. siap2a is expressed at a relatively low level in flowers and early fruit stages but it is strongly up-regulated between the mature green and breaker stages and is highly expressed to the red-ripe stage  <cit> . three homologs  of siap2a were identified in the watermelon transcriptome. cla <dig> was expressed at a relatively low level and down-regulated during ripening . on the contrary, cla <dig> and cla <dig> expression was almost constant during ripening although with differences in their relative expression levels. cla <dig> was in fact expressed at a relatively low level  whereas cla <dig> was highly expressed throughout ripening  suggesting cla <dig> is the most likely functional ortholog of slap2a in watermelon, though its role in non-climacteric ripening may be in a different context than through regulation of ethylene response.

an additional member of the ap2/erf superfamily, slerf <dig>  has been recently identified to play an important role in tomato fruit ripening and carotenoid accumulation acting as a negative regulator of two of the predominant nutritional compounds of tomato, lycopene and β-carotene  <cit> . ethylene response factors  are plant transcriptional regulators mediating ethylene-dependent gene expression via binding to the gcc motif found in the promoter region of ethylene-regulated genes. two watermelon genes  have high similarity with slerf <dig>  while cla <dig> was constitutively expressed during ripening with no significant changes over time , cla <dig> expression was up regulated during the late stages of watermelon ripening, peaking at the pink stage . it has been suggested that slerf <dig> may integrate ethylene-dependent and independent regulatory activities to allow for the fine-tuning of signal outputs.

putative homologs of tomato components of the light signal transduction pathway, such as de-etiolated <dig> , uv-damaged dna binding protein <dig>  and cullin- <dig>  were identified in watermelon . all three genes were expressed at a low level during watermelon fruit ripening with no significant variation  suggesting they are probably not rate limiting in isoprenoid biosynthesis and associated fruit pigmentation.

glk <dig>  transcription factor  determines chlorophyll accumulation and distribution in developing tomato fruits by controlling chloroplast formation. in tomato it is expressed in fruits where it accumulates at the mature-green stage  <cit> . in watermelon fruits the sequence cla <dig> was identified as putative homolog of glk <dig>  but no transcript reads were generated by the illumina rna sequencing technology suggesting it is not expressed during ripening. this is in accordance with the evidences that watermelon flesh chromoplasts do not de-differentiate from chloroplasts as occurs in tomatoes but, mainly, from undifferentiated proplastids  <cit> .

another transcription factor, the homeobox protein lehb- <dig>  was reported to regulate fruit ripening through transcriptional control of 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid oxidase  <dig>  expression  <cit> . lehb- <dig> is highly expressed in tomato flower buds, senescing flowers, and developing immature and mature green fruits, but its mrna declined during ripening and is maintained at a stable but relatively low level in red-ripe fruits  <cit> . cla <dig> the putative watermelon homolog of lehb- <dig> was expressed in developing watermelon fruits at the white stage, down regulated at the beginning of carotenoid accumulation  and up-regulated at the pink and red-ripe stages of ripening . ethylene is not essential for non-climacteric fruits, however, recent studies indicate that ethylene and/or a modulated sensitivity to ethylene might participate in physiological changes during non-climacteric fruit development  <cit> . indeed, many non-climacteric fruits, including watermelon, are highly sensitive to exogenous ethylene  <cit> . in addition cla <dig> may regulate isoprenoid accumulation in an ethylene independent way by controlling other regulative factors. putative lehb- <dig> sites have been, in fact, found in the promoters of a number of ripening related genes, including lerin-mads and nac-nor.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these results suggest maintenance of many regulators in the watermelon genome in common with tomato, yet suggest a complex and, for many aspects, different regulatory system for isoprenoid biosynthesis between these fruits. while a common set of metabolic and regulatory genes influences carotenoid accumulation during development and ripening, specific regulatory systems may also differ possibly related to the different ripening physiologies of climacteric and non-climacteric fruits. as such, these data represent the starting point for characterizing conserved and distinct regulatory functions of isoprenoid biosynthesis in climacteric and non-climacteric species. they also provide information and targets for plant researchers and breeders to test as potential tools for watermelon crop improvement. since this study was done only at the transcriptional level, subsequent experimentation is required to see if other changes arise at other levels of cellular regulation.
