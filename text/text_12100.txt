BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  remains a major global health concern. its causative agent, mycobacterium tuberculosis, has been estimated to infect approximately one-third of the world's population  <cit> , and approximately  <dig> million people have died from the disease in the past decade  <cit> . the world health organization estimated a total of  <dig> million new cases of tb and approximately  <dig> million deaths from this disease in  <dig>  second only to aids among infectious diseases  <cit> . the emergence of drug resistant isolates of m. tuberculosis, particularly of multi drug-resistant tb , defined as resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin  <cit> , imposes a great challenge to public health  <cit> . treatment of mdr-tb requires the administration of second-line drugs that are more toxic and less effective  <cit> . more recently, it was reported cases of extensively drug-resistant  tb, which are defined as cases in persons with tb whose isolates were resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin and at least three of the six main classes of second-line drugs   <cit> . xdr-tb has a wide geographic distribution and it raises the bleak prospect of a future epidemic of virtually untreatable tb. new antimycobacterial agents are thus needed to improve the treatment of mdr- and xdr-tb, to shorten the treatment course and increase patient compliance, and to provide more effective treatment of latent tb infection.

a valuable approach to the development of selective antimicrobial chemotherapy is to exploit the inhibition of targets unique and vital to the pathogen  <cit> . the enzymes of the shikimate pathway are attractive examples of these targets because this route is essential in higher plants, fungi, bacteria and algae and is absent in mammals  <cit> . in m. tuberculosis, the shikimate pathway leads to the biosynthesis of a wide range of primary and secondary metabolites, including aromatic amino acids, folate, naphthoquinones, menaquinones and mycobactins  <cit> . disruption of arok-encoding shikimate kinase gene has recently shown that the shikimate pathway is essential for m. tuberculosis viability  <cit> , which establishes the enzymes of this pathway as potential targets for the development of new antimycobacterial agents.

homologues to the shikimate pathway enzymes were identified in the complete genome sequence of m. tuberculosis h37rv  <cit> . among them, chorismate synthase -3-phosphoshikimate phosphate lyase) encoding gene  was proposed to be present by sequence homology. cs catalyzes an unusual  <dig> -anti-elimination of the 3-phosphate group and the c- hydrogen from 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate  forming chorismate and phosphate  <cit> . although there is no overall change in its redox state, there is an absolute requirement for a reduced flavin mononucleotide   <cit> . another interesting feature of css from different organisms is how reduced fmnred is obtained, which divides these enzymes into two classes: monofunctional and bifunctional  <cit> . the css from fungi are bifunctional as they display a second enzymatic activity , an nadh-dependent  flavin reductase , which confers them an intrinsic ability to reduce flavin using nadh  <cit> . the css from plants and escherichia coli are monofunctional as they do not possess this activity and are active only in anaerobic conditions in the presence of either chemically or enzymatically reduced flavin  <cit> . however, there has been no report on both confirmation of the correct assignment of rv2540c  as the m. tuberculosis chorismate synthase  coding sequence and functional characterization of its protein product. moreover, there has been no report on whether mtcs is bifunctional or monofunctional.

here we report the amplification and cloning of rv2540c dna sequence  from m. tuberculosis, and heterologous overexpression of the mtcs protein. the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity using a three-step purification protocol and its identity was confirmed by n-terminal sequencing, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry . the oligomeric state of mtcs was determined by gel filtration. we also show that cs from m. tuberculosis is bifunctional, as in fungi, based on activity measurements of both chorismate synthase and nadh-dependent flavin reductase activities. moreover, fmn appears to be bound to mtcs based on ionic exchange chromatography, and fmnox  and nadh binding to mtcs were assessed by spectroscopic measurements at equilibrium. the apparent kinetic constants for the holoenzyme mtcs-fmnox for nadh were determined. the nadh-dependent flavin reductase activity was characterized by isotope effects. measurements of primary deuterium and solvent kinetic isotope effects were carried out to probe the nature of the rate-limiting step of the redox reaction. multiple isotope effects were also determined showing that a stepwise mechanism is involved in this reaction. proton inventory on the maximal velocity allowed us to address the number of kinetically important transferred protons. the results presented here are important to understand the reaction mechanism of this enzyme, which should pave the way for the rational-based design of mtcs inhibitors with potential antitubercular activity and low toxicity.

RESULTS
molecular cloning, expression, and purification of mtcs
pcr amplification of rv2540c dna sequence  from genomic m. tuberculosis dna yielded a fragment with the expected length . the fragment was cloned into pet23a expression vector, and the arof gene was sequenced, which confirmed its identity and the absence of pcr -introduced mutations. a number of e. coli host strains were employed to express mtcs, including bl <dig>  origami, and bl21trxb, but no expression could be obtained. different cultivating temperatures  and presence or absence of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside  were also employed to no avail . mtcs overexpression could only be achieved in e. coli rosetta host cells, which provide trnas for codons that are rarely used by e. coli. in agreement, ten rare codons were identified on m. tuberculosis arof sequence . sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis revealed a cell extract containing a significant amount of a soluble protein with an apparent molecular weight in agreement with the predicted value based on amino acid sequence for mtcs  .

interestingly, recombinant protein expression was achieved in e. coli rosetta host cells grown for  <dig> h at 37°c in the absence of iptg induction. it has been previously shown that the lac-controlled systems, including the pet system, could have a high-level protein expression, in the absence of inducer. this phenomenon occurs in the cell stationary phase, when there is the presence of a complex medium, cyclic amp, acetate and low ph  <cit> . recently, another shikimate pathway enzyme from m. tuberculosis, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate  synthase, was reported to be expressed only in the absence of iptg  <cit> . the three-step purification protocol yielded approximately  <dig> mg of mtcs from  <dig> liters of cell culture. no other protein can be observed on sds-page, which indicates the high level of mtcs purity . the mtcs activity before the purification can hardly be measured, probably due to interfering compounds, and thus only the amount of total recombinant protein could be assessed. the ammonium sulfate precipitation of purified mtcs resulted in total inactivation of the enzyme . homogeneous recombinant protein was thus instantaneously frozen in liquid nitrogen in the absence of ammonium sulfate, which proved to be a convenient protocol for active homogeneous recombinant mtcs protein storage.

analysis of purified mtcs
the esi-ms of homogeneous mtcs revealed a subunit molecular mass of  <dig>  da, consistent with the theoretical molecular mass . the first  <dig> n-terminal amino acid residues were identified as mlrwitageshgralv, which confirmed the identity of homogeneous mtcs and presence of n-terminal methionine residue. analytical gel filtration chromatography revealed a single peak of approximately  <dig> kda, suggesting that mtcs is a dimer in solution, which is in agreement with the hydrodynamic properties of the recombinant protein assessed by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium  <cit> .

the cs activity of mtcs
the synthesis of epsp was carried out in a vial containing the enzymes mtsk and mtepsps, which convert shikimate, atp and phosphoenolpyruvate  to 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate , adp and pi. the equilibrium of the forward reaction was displaced using purine nucleoside phosphorylase , which consumes pi, increasing the final concentration of epsp in the reaction mixture. the enzymes were removed by ultrafiltration to avoid any residual mtepsps enzyme activity that could release pi in solution, which would thus interfere with specific measurements of mtcs enzyme activity. conversion of epsp to chorismate and pi catalyzed by mtcs enzyme activity  was determined by measuring the release of pi using pnp, which converts 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside  and pi to ribose-1-phosphate and 7-methyl-6-thio-guanine base, monitoring absorbance of the latter at  <dig> nm. the enzymatic activity of homogenous mtcs was dependent on enzyme volume added to the reaction mixture , showing that the initial velocity is proportional to total enzyme concentration and that true initial velocities are being measured. the conversion of epsp to chorismate in aerobic conditions by the addition of fmnox and nadh is the first solid evidence that mtcs is bifunctional, since the monofunctional css can only be assayed under strictly anaerobic conditions in the presence of chemically or enzymatically reduced flavin  <cit> . the specific activity of bifunctional mtcs  is approximately 175-fold lower than the specific activity of bifunctional neurospora crassa cs   <cit> . in the presence of oxygen the cs activity is limited by the reoxidation of fmnred cofactor; but in bifunctional css, nadh is used in consecutive cycles to maintain the fmn in its reduced form . moreover, the structures of cs complexed with fmn from helicobacter pylori  <cit>  and streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit>  have shown that there are a number of positively charged amino acids in the fmn binding pocket, which could increase the reduction potential of fmnox/fmnred couple, likely permitting the decrease of the rate of reoxidation. indeed, in bifunctional nccs the redox potential of the couple fmnred/fmnox was determined to be - <dig> mv, i.e.  <dig> mv more positive than that of the free couple in solution   <cit> .

the nadh:fmn-oxidoreductase activity of mtcs
the nadh-dependent reduction of fmnox was measured in the forward reaction monitoring the decrease in nadh concentration. the nadh:fmn-oxidoreductase activity of homogenous mtcs is dependent on the enzyme volume added to the reaction mixture; therefore the initial velocity is proportional to total enzyme concentration, and true initial velocities are being measured. to verify the stability of the mtcs-fmnox complex, mtcs was incubated with excess fmnox and loaded on an anion exchange column. two peaks were observed and collected into separated fractions measuring absorbance at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, and pooled . to roughly estimate the presence of protein in the two pools, coomassie-blue was added to them and only the second pool was shown to contain protein , while the first was not stained . the uv-vis spectrum for the second pool containing recombinant mtcs protein showed that all the characteristic absorbance peaks of fmnox  could be observed . these results suggest that mtcs and fmnox form a stable binary complex.

although the fmnox usually appears as a prosthetic group in nadh:fmn oxidoreductases from other organisms  <cit> , it was not clear whether in mtcs the fmn is covalently bound. css from other organisms, such as that from e. coli, showed low affinity for fmnox; but the value of kd for fmnox depends strongly on epsp binding, decreasing ca. 1000-fold in the presence of this substrate   <cit> . on the other hand, epsp has a much smaller effect on the affinity of bifunctional nccs to fmnox  <cit> . interestingly, the purified mtcs is fmn-free, which could be an effect of the insufficient intracellular concentration of fmn, probably due to mtcs overexpression into the host cell. as described below, fmn appears to have a value lower than  <dig> μm for the overall dissociation constant for mtcs-fmn binary complex formation at equilibrium. accordingly, it appears to be more likely that fmn is lost during the protein purification protocol because of a rather weak affinity of mtcs for fmn. accordingly, the kinetic data were collected considering the holoenzyme as the mtcs-fmnox complex brought about by incubating mtcs and near-saturating fmnox concentration.

the oxidoreductase activity is functionally independent of cs activity, since the consumption of nadh occurs in the absence of epsp. considering the low specific activity of nadh:fmn-oxidoreductase in mtcs, all measurements were made in triplicate, including the controls. accordingly, the apparent kinetic parameters for the oxidoreductase activity were determined in the absence of epsp in steady-state kinetic experiments. no activity was observed when nadph was used at concentrations ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μm . kinetics of reduction of the mtcs-bound fmnox by nadh was determined using fixed amount of holoenzyme and varying levels of nadh . the data were fitted to equation  <dig>  and yielded the following values: knadh =  <dig> ±  <dig> μm, kcat =  <dig>   × 10- <dig> s- <dig> and kcat/knadh =  <dig> m- <dig> s- <dig>  the knadh observed for mtcs is similar to the knadph determined for nccs  <cit>  and sccs  <cit>  . in other nadh:fmn oxidoreductases , which are present in various organisms, the apparent kinetic constants show significant variation. for instance, the knadh can vary from  <dig> μm in rhodococcus erythropolis  <cit>  to  <dig>  μm in bacillus subtilis  <cit> .

equilibrium measurements of fmnox and nadh binding to mtcs
the binding of fmnox to mtcs was assessed by uv-visible difference spectra as described by kitzing et al.  <cit> . the observed spectral changes are characterized by hypochromic effects on the flavin absorbance at both  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm up to  <dig> μm fmnox . at fmnox concentrations larger than  <dig> μm there is a hyperchromic effect that is probably due to free oxidized fmn in solution . the spectral changes at low fmnox concentrations yielded low values for the difference spectra and thus no reliable data could be obtained at concentrations lower than  <dig> μm. accordingly, the data presented here allow only to estimate an upper limit value of  <dig> μm for the fmnox equilibrium dissociation constant. we have also tried to determine the dissociation constant of fmnox from protein fluorescence titration as recently described by broco et al  <cit> , which could allow reliable measurement of oxidized fmn binding to mtcs at low concentrations of fmnox. however, there was no quench/enhancement in protein fluorescence upon fmnox binding to mtcs . at any rate, the uv-visible difference spectra show mtcs-fmnox binary complex formation.

the equilibrium binding of nadh to mtcs was assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy. there is a quench in protein fluorescence upon nadh binding to mtcs . a titration curve showing the quench in protein fluorescence upon the binding of nadh to mtcs is given in figure  <dig>  the data were fitted to a hyperbolic equation yielding a dissociation constant value of  <dig> ±  <dig> μm. even though the nadh-binding site remains unknown, the results presented here clearly indicate that there is indeed an nadh binding site on mtcs enzyme.

primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects
to probe for rate-limiting steps and determine the stereospecificity of hydride transfer, primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects were determined. initial velocity data were collected using either nadh or nadh , and values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  were determined for, respectively, dv and dv/k. the magnitude of the primary isotope effects when the nadh substrate is used indicates that c4-pros hydrogen is being transferred during the reduction of fmnox catalyzed by mtcs. isotope effects on v are related to events following the formation of the complex capable of undergoing catalysis , including chemical steps, possible enzyme conformational changes, and product release. isotope effects on v/k report on steps in the reaction mechanism from the binding of the labeled substrate to the first irreversible step, usually product release  <cit> . the values for primary deuterium isotope effects of biochemical interest usually range from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> , and steps such as conformational changes accompanying hydride transfer and product release may account for the lower values. in particular, primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects typically range from  <dig> to  <dig> for enzyme reactions involving nadh oxidation  <cit> . the dv value obtained for mtcs-fmnox  suggests that the hydride transfer contributes significantly to the rate-limiting step of the fmn reduction reaction. the value of  <dig>  for the dv/k indicates that nadh is not sticky, since dv/k values for sticky substrates are around unity  <cit> . it should be remembered that a substrate is sticky if it reacts to give products as fast as, or faster than, it dissociates from the enzyme. the stickiness of a substrate depends on the external part of its commitment: the larger the external commitment, the sticker the substrate  <cit> .

solvent isotope effects and proton inventory
solvent isotope effects were employed to assess the contribution of solvent proton transfer to the rate of flavin reduction. initial velocity data were collected in either h2o or  <dig> atom % d2o , and values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  were obtained for d2ov and d2ov/k, respectively. the magnitude of the solvent isotope effects indicate that proton transfer partially limit the rate of fmn reduction reaction. in order to determine the number of kinetically important protons transferred during the reaction, a proton inventory on v was carried out. the mole fraction of d2o was varied from  <dig> to 80%, and a linear relationship between v and the mole fraction of d2o was observed . this result indicates that a single proton transfer gives rise to the observed solvent isotope effect  <cit> .

multiple isotope effects
significantly different magnitudes between primary and solvent kinetic isotope effects may indicate that they are reporting on distinct steps of a reaction, as reported for the nadph-dependent ketoacyl-acp reductase from s. pneumoniae  <cit> . the primary isotope effect values  are larger than those for solvent isotope effects , suggesting that proton and hydride transfer may take place in two distinct transition-states, with the latter being more rate-limiting for the mtcs-catalyzed reaction. multiple isotope effects studies are able to distinguish whether two different isotopic substitutions affect the same or different chemical steps. theory predicts that if protonation and hydride transfer occur in the same transition state, the primary isotope effects will be larger or unchanged with d2o as compared to h2o. on the other hand, if hydride transfer and protonation occur in distinct steps, the primary isotope effects will be smaller with d2o as solvent, as proton transfer will become more rate limiting  <cit> . multiple isotope effects were thus evaluated to distinguish whether two different isotopic substitutions affect the same or different chemical steps, i.e., if the reduction of fmnox catalyzed by mtcs occurs, respectively, in a concerted or in a stepwise mechanism. initial velocity data were collected and values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  were obtained for d2ovnadh and d2ov/knadh, respectively . the values for the primary kinetic isotope effects on v and v/k in d2o were smaller than the effects in h2o, thereby suggesting a stepwise mechanism for the reduction of fmnox. a mechanism for bifunctional nccs has been proposed and involves an electron transfer from fmnred to c <dig> epsp and c-o bond cleavage, protonation of the leaving phosphate group by his <dig>  tautomerization of the resulting c4-neutral flavin semiquinone to a radical species with concomitant abstraction of the c- hydrogen of the dephosphorylated substrate intermediate, and reduced flavin deprotonation restores the initial state of the cofactor  <cit> . more recently, it has been shown for nccs that the carboxylate group of asp <dig> participates in the water-mediated deprotonation of the n atom of the isoalloxazine ring system of fmnred that is involved in abstraction of c- hydrogen of epsp  <cit> . a comparison of the primary sequences of css from different sources has shown that these residues  are conserved  <cit> . interestingly, his <dig> and asp <dig> are present in monofunctinal and bifunctional css and across all known species  <cit> , and these residues are part of the characteristic cs signature sequence  <cit> . the role of his <dig> and asp <dig> in the mode of action of bifunctional mtcs should await site-directed mutagenesis studies that are currently underway in our laboratory.

CONCLUSIONS
it has recently been pointed out that we are currently unable to predict bifuncionality based on sequence information and three-dimensional structures available at present because of difficulties in identifying the nadh-binding site of bifunctional css  <cit> . incidentally, the three-dimensional structural model  <cit>  and x-ray diffraction structure  <cit>  of mtcs employed the crystal structure of cs from streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit>  as template, which is a monofunctional cs. it is thus necessary to measure cs enzyme activity to show whether it depends on a source of free reduced fmn  or can directly reduce fmn cofactor at the expense of nadh . here we present experimental evidence that recombinant mtcs is bifunctional. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a bacterial cs is bifunctional. we also show that fmn and nadh bind to free mtcs. primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects of the nadh-dependent flavin reductase activity of mtcs showed that c4-pros hydrogen is transferred during the reduction of fmnox, and that hydride transfer contributes significantly to the rate-limiting step of fmn reduction. solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects suggest that proton transfer from solvent partially limits the rate of fmn reduction and that a single proton is transferred from solvent. multiple isotope effects indicate that a stepwise mechanism for the reduction of fmnox. expression of functional proteins in soluble form has been identified as an important bottleneck in efforts to determine biological activity and crystal structure of m. tuberculosis proteins  <cit> . moreover, protein purification has become an important asset in any structural genomic effort as there has been increasing demand for homogeneous proteins  <cit> . accordingly, the work presented here should contribute to overcome these obstacles for, at least, mtcs and allow functional and structural efforts to be pursued. we provide experimental evidence for the correct assignment of the rv2540c dna sequence as a cs-coding arof gene in m. tuberculosis, which is a pivotal step for the rational design of inhibitors of mtcs enzyme activity with potential antitubercular action. the availability of mtcs and the experimental evidence given here for an nadh-binding site warrant further efforts to obtain the crystal structure of the binary complex to try to elucidate the structural features of this interaction and the mechanism of action for bifunctional css. the results reported here should thus pave the way for further functional and structural studies to guide the rational design of antitubercular agents.
