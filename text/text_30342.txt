BACKGROUND
on a taxonomic and phylogenetic scale, ciona intestinalis is a protochordate belonging to the ascidian class of urochordates that diverged from a lineage leading to the vertebrates approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this extant ascidian occupies a crucial place in the "tree of life" as an out-group to the vertebrates and hence studies addressing evolutionary aspects of ciona have the potential to offer insight into some of the most intriguing questions about the origin of the vertebrates from a chordate lineage. recent genomic analysis has shown that the urochordates, and not cephalochordates, are the closest extant relatives of vertebrates  <cit> . as an added advantage, this ascidan is also amenable to experimentation and even has a century old history of being used for embryological studies  <cit> . a translucent morphology, availability of developmental mutants, established transgenic experimental procedures, est databases and quickly spawning embryos are just a few advantages that make ciona a favourite model system for developmental biologists. ciona has a compact genome size of about  <dig> million base pairs and contains approximately  <dig>  protein-coding genes  <cit> .

gpcr based signal transduction is ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes and forms the basis of detection of diverse environmental cues such as odorant molecules, amines, peptides, lipids, nucleotides and photons. a common structural feature of gpcrs is the presence of a highly conserved architecture of seven stretches of transmembrane spanning residues linked by alternate extracellular and intracellular loops. the diversity among gpcrs primarily stem from the presence of characteristic n-terminal extracellular domains and c-terminal intracellular domains and to a relatively lesser extent from the connecting loops which share limited sequence similarity. a number of fully sequenced genomes have been mined for their repertoire of gpcrs and comparative phylogenetic studies described for homo sapiens  <cit> , tetraodon nigrovirdis  <cit> , anopheles gambiae  <cit> , gallus gallus  <cit> , rattus rattus  <cit> , mus musculus  <cit> , drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and branchiostoma floridae  <cit> .

on the basis of a large scale phylogenetic analysis, gpcrs in human and subsequently in many other genomes have been classified into five major families ;glutamate , rhodopsin , adhesion , frizzled/smoothened , and secretin   <cit> . we denote the family names in italic with an initial capital letter to avoid possible confusion with for example, the rhodopsin receptor. hmms  derived from the grafs classification system, along with the hmms of other non-grafs families of gpcrs have been used to tract putative gpcrs from  <dig> completely sequenced genomes  into specific families and subfamilies. the analysis revealed that grafs families can be found in all bilateral species suggesting that they arose before the split of nematodes from the chordate lineage  <cit> . a recent review details progress in mining the gene repertoire and expressed sequence tags  for gpcrs in several completed genomes  <cit> .

the ciona genome provides scope for identification of gpcrs that are analogous in function to its vertebrate counterparts. this provides a resource for comparative analysis aimed at assigning function to putative gene products  <cit> . furthermore, comparative protein domain analysis as implemented in evolutionary trace methods can identify functional interface residues essential for ligand binding and subsequent signalling events  <cit> . identification of conserved domains and/or novel gpcrs and their ligands are of major interest in light of the well-recognized roles of gpcrs in clinical medicine  <cit> . furthermore, the repertoire of gpcrs in ciona could provide insights into some of the intriguing questions in evolutionary biology about the origins and evolution of the gpcr signalling system in a protochordate and its further diversification into the vertebrate lineage. ciona possesses organ systems are homologous to vertebrate heart, thyroid, notochord and pineal systems  <cit> . our comparative genomic analysis could now serve as a basis for carrying out molecular genetic studies in ciona to address many functional and regulatory aspects of gpcr associated vertebrate organ development and physiology. finally, it is also important to note that such genome-wide comparisons may provide some wrong conclusions about orthologous relationships in individual cases and results from such analysis are best used as complementary tools for carrying out specific experimental studies.

here, we describe the repertoire of gpcrs in the ciona intestinalis genome and provide a comparative perspective to the grafs families, including a detailed analysis of the ldlrr-gpcr  family in ciona.

RESULTS
our aim was to generate an independent data set of the repertoire of ciona gpcrs and thereupon, using phylogenetic approaches provide a comparative genomic perspective of the salient features observed in the repertoire. in order to generate the complete set of putative gpcrs, we adopted a comprehensive strategy wherein predicted 6/7/ <dig> transmembrane receptor sequences identified from the jgi  ciona proteome was subjected to an array of similarity and pattern search analysis for gpcr specific features. the hits from these search methods were further subjected to phylogenetic analyses . such a process identified  <dig> putative gpcrs that represent ~ <dig>  % of the total number of gene products predicted from the ciona genome. the proportion of gpcrs to the genome size is therefore comparable to those predicted in vertebrate and insect genomes  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, manual searches revealed only  <dig> unique ciona gpcr sequences to be present in the current updated public sequence repositories. the ciona gpcrs identified are summarized in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  the complete list of ciona gpcr sequences identified through this study is available as additional data file  <dig>

hmm based genome-wide gpcr surveys have been previously carried out in  <dig> genomes, including that of ciona  <cit> . while this hmm based study provided a broad overview of the repertoire of gpcrs in the ciona genome, an independent large-scale molecular phylogenetic treatment with respect to the tunicate gpcrs has not emerged and awaits investigation. gpcr features reflecting highly specialized ascidian specific biology are usually evident from such phylogenetic analysis. of particular interest are whole-genome orthology and paralogy comparisons that are not evident from the previous hmm based search approach  <cit> . a table describing orthology and paralogy observations identified in ciona gpcrs through our comparative genomic studies is provided . our phylogenetic study also provides the first ever insight into ciona specific protochordate gpcr repertoire apart from vindicating the presence of the five major grafs families . homologs of the chemosensory gpcrs from nematodes, plant gpcrs, yeast pheromone receptors, gustatory and olfactory receptors from insects were not identified.  <dig> clear orthologs of human gpcrs could be identified in ciona based on phylogenetic analysis.

since est evidence covers three quarters of the predicted ciona genes, we also identified est matches for the  <dig> putative gpcrs using tblastn with a stringent cut off e-value of 1e- <dig>  except for  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences, the rest of the gpcrs had at least one est match. est matches for these receptors were sorted as being derived from different developmental stages including fertilized egg, tailbud embryo, larval, embryo, gastrula and neurula, cleavage/cleaving stage, stage  <dig>  directional larva, young adult, juvenile and mature adult stage as well as adult tissues like heart, neural complex, gonad, digestive, blood/haemocytes, endostyle and testis . a preliminary observation from the est table also showed that as many as  <dig> receptors had at least one match that could be recovered in the ten different developmental stages of ciona at the cut off e-value of 10- <dig>  suggestive of a role for these gpcrs in developmental processes.

the rhodopsin family 
the rhodopsin family in ciona includes  <dig> receptors that constitute about 68% of the entire gpcr repertoire. the rhodopsin family has analogous subfamily level representatives among the four main groups, termed α-, β-, γ-, and δ-group, which in turn are subdivided into  <dig> major subfamilies in humans  <cit> . at the individual gene level,  <dig> out of the  <dig> rhodopsin receptors display a clear human ortholog. however, unlike in the human rhodopsin family, distinct clustering into the four major groups was not observed in ciona. this is only expected since it is known that such grouping or relatedness is very restricted as regards species content.

our large-scale phylogenetic analysis of ciona rhodopsin family with annotated receptors from other genomes revealed the presence of  <dig> of the  <dig> subfamilies described for the human rhodopsin family . one noteworthy finding in the ciona rhodopsin repertoire is the identification of an innovative low-density lipoprotein receptor repeat containing gpcr cluster . the ldlrr-gpcrs, the ciona lgr-like sequences  and the glhrs  clustered into one main branch with a high bootstrap support  . for the sake of clarity in discussions, the rhodopsin phylogenetic representation is split into two subsets, one comprising the ldlrr-gpcr/lgr-like set of receptors and the other consisting of the non- cluster. among the non- set of sequences, the melanocortin receptors of the α-group, the classical chemokine receptors , melanocyte-concentrating hormone  subfamilies of the γ-group and the purine , mas-related receptor  and olfactory subfamilies of the δ-group are conspicuously absent. as many as  <dig> receptors could not be included in any subfamily with significant phylogenetic support. these sequences were thus designated as "other rhodopsins". rhodopsin subfamily members that could not be annotated at the individual gene level due to lack of support via cross-genome phylogenetic clustering were deemed as "unclassified rhodopsins". the "unclassified rhodopsins" are different from the "other rhodopsins" in that most of these "unclassified rhodopsins" could be included into individual rhodopsin subfamilies when analyzed with limited number of sequences, but in a larger data set do not give stable or consistent topology. since several of these "unclassified rhodopsins" and "other rhodopsins" appear to be ciona specific and were divergent from the rhodopsin subfamilies in other genomes, they were excluded from the final phylogenetic representation to avoid tree artefacts.

the ldlrr/lgr-like/glhr cluster 
ciona shows a novel lineage specific expansion and innovation in the ldlrr-gpcr/lgr-like/glhr rhodopsin cluster with  <dig> receptors,  <dig> of which are similar to the human insl3/relaxin binding gpcrs in their tm regions. of the  <dig> receptors in this cluster, two sequences were found to be lgr-like , with leucine-rich repeat domains  observable in their n-termini. the sequence ci <dig> possesses five lrr domains and was identified as a candidate inls3/relaxin gpcr-like based on conserved domain database searches. the sequence ci <dig> is an n-terminal lrr containing gpcr that does not bear any significant similarity to insl3/relaxin binding gpcrs in its tm region. one glycoprotein hormone receptor could be recovered  and was identified as an ortholog of lhcgr .

it is noteworthy that as many as  <dig> out of the  <dig> receptors apart from bearing sequence similarity to insl3/relaxin binding gpcrs in their tm region, comprise of a low density lipoprotein receptor class a domain  represented either singly or in 2– <dig> multiple tandem repeats at the n-termini . in contrast to other vertebrate lgrs  where a single ldl-a module at the n terminus of the ectodomain is followed by multiple lrrs and  <dig> tm helices, the  <dig> ciona ldlrr-gpcr family members lack lrrs  <cit>  . also notable is the fact that this unique domain organisation of ldl-a domain tandem repeats in ciona has been reported only in snail lgr that contains tandem repeats of ldl-a domains in addition to multiple lrr domains  <cit>  .  <dig> additional sequences belonging to this subfamily possess shorter n-terminal regions that do not contain any explicitly recognizable domains while bearing insl3/relaxin binding gpcr-like tm regions . these sequences are therefore not authentic n-terminal associated "leucine rich repeat containing gpcrs" and hence been designated as "unclassified lgr-like". it is possible that the  <dig> "unclassified lgr-like" sequences are fragmentary or incompletely modelled at the n-termini. at least one instance of an incorrectly aligned domain architecture in a ldl-a domain bearing gpcr was revealed  after a blat of the sequence was performed against the ciona genome. a proposed correct model is provided in the additional data file  <dig> 

a phylogenetic analysis was carried out to resolve the relationship between the human lgrs , the snail lgr, the  <dig> ciona ldlrr-gpcr family members  and the one candidate insl3/relaxin binding gpcr-like sequence . the unifying theme among all these receptors is their insl3/relaxin binding gpcr-like tm region. this phylogenetic tree was rooted using a human lhcgr and a ciona orphan lgr-like  that are distantly related to these sequences . the receptors in this data set were truncated to include only the sequence of the intervening tm 1- tm 6/ <dig> region. this truncation was carried out to eliminate the variabilities in the number of ldl-a and lrr tandem repeats.

phylogenetic analysis shows that the human lgrs, the snail lgr, the  <dig> ciona ldlrr-gpcrs and the one ciona insl3/relaxin gpcr-like  clustered into one group separately from the distantly related human lhcgr and the ciona lgr-like outgroup suggestive of a common evolutionary origin to the insl3/relaxin gpcr-like  <dig> tm region. furthermore, the domain analysis also suggests that the  <dig> ciona ldlrr-gpcrs and the one candidate ciona insl3/relaxin gpcr-like seem to have evolved independently of the human lgrs and the snail lgr in the non-tm n-terminal regions.

the glutamate family 
many glutamate  receptors are crucial modulators involved in neurotransmission. most of these receptors have long n-termini that serve to bind a cognate ligand  <cit> . the ciona glutamate family clustered with a strong bootstrap support  separating the cluster from its closest neighbours . phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ciona genome contains  <dig> members of the glutamate family. these receptors represent all of the glr subfamilies with the exception of taste  receptors. human orthologs for calcium-sensing receptor , retinoic acid inducible gpcr , metabotropic glutamate receptor  and gaba receptors could be identified in ciona with significant sequence similarity. among the ciona glrs, the casr  homolog displayed the highest identity to the human counterpart casr . ests for the metabotropic gabab related receptor  could be retrieved from the neural-complex tissues in ciona, suggesting similar roles for this receptor in synaptic function as proposed in vertebrates .

the secretin family 
the secretin family includes receptors for calcitonin , vasoactive intestinal peptide , glucagon-like peptide , pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide , the parathyroid hormone receptor  and several other related peptides as well as hormones  <cit> . the ciona secretin family received very high bootstrap support  .  <dig> gpcrs could be identified in ciona and are related to the vertebrate secretin family with which they shared high sequence similarity. the phylogenetic clustering also supports possible specific gene duplication events for three pairs of sequences, evident from the high bootstrap support  for the tree nodes for the pairs , , and . this is consistent with the recent report on the evolution of secretin family receptors in ciona  <cit> . the gene pair  clusters with the pthr subfamily of receptors, while the pair  clusters with glpr group. the remaining pair  clusters with the crhr group, whereas ci <dig> and ci <dig> appear to be orthologs of glpr and calcr/calcrl respectively . among secretin receptors, the ciona pthr homologs  showed the highest sequence identity  to their human counterparts .

the frizzled/smoothened family 
the ciona proteome data set contains  <dig> members of the frizzled/smoothened gpcr family each of which have at least  <dig> tm regions. the ciona frizzled receptor cluster branched out with a very high bootstrap support  in nj trees . frizzled receptors have been shown to couple with g-proteins after activation by wnt, a glycoprotein ligand and are known to play a key role in tissue-polarity and cell signalling  <cit> . the frizzled family is a recently identified group among the gpcrs, although its origin can be traced back to the arthropods. ciona possesses a clear one-to-one ortholog each for human fzd <dig>  fzd <dig> and fzd <dig> apart from a smoothened-like  ortholog. the conserved  motif required for wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway can be observed two amino acids after the seventh transmembrane helix in all the recovered ciona frizzled receptors  <cit> . an alignment of the tm regions of the frizzled ortholog pairs  of humans and ciona revealed that they are very well conserved with identities in range of ~48– <dig> %. the smoh receptor shares ~ <dig> % identity with its ciona ortholog  in the tm region. however, the taste <dig>  receptors seem to be absent in ciona.

in a separate analysis, we identified four more ciona frizzled family members  that were fragmentary models with less than  <dig> tm regions. these fragmentary sequences were not included in the final ciona gpcr dataset for better handling of the msa  data for subsequent phylogenetic studies.

the adhesion family 
the ciona genome includes  <dig> adhesion family members and is the second largest group of gpcrs after the rhodopsin family. this family is characterized by long n-termini that contain multiple functional domains with adhesion-like motifs that are often sites of glycosylation events  <cit> . it is noteworthy that ciona with a relatively smaller genome possesses as many adhesion members as any of the other larger vertebrate genomes  <cit> . the density  of gpcr adhesion family is  <dig> gene/~ <dig> kb in ciona whereas it is  <dig> gene/~ <dig> kb for human. this denser ciona gpcr group relative to human genome is also accompanied by a lack of clear-cut homology to human adhesion gpcrs. among all the major family clusters in our analysis, the adhesion family received the lowest bootstrap support  . of the  <dig> ciona receptors identified,  <dig> showed unambiguous orthologous relationship with human members in a large scale comparison of the adhesion gpcrs of the two genomes . ciona adhesion members that received complete support from its human counterparts were included in the final representation . the human genome contains  <dig> adhesion receptors that display a phylogenetic clustering into eight main groups   <cit> . ciona orthologs of the human adhesion subfamilies includes one representative  of the he6/gp <dig> cluster , one representative  of the gpr123- <dig> cluster  and one ortholog  of the celsr genes   <cit> . the remaining  <dig> receptors  are orthologous to the lec subfamily of human adhesion group i.

a search for potential orthologs of the remaining  <dig> ciona receptors using pipealign and further phylogenetic analysis with top hits from the search failed to identify unambiguous orthologs when performing both nj and maximum likelihood analysis. adhesion gpcrs that could not be assigned specific subfamilies due to lack of support in cross-genome phylogenetic analysis were deemed as "unclassified adhesion".  <dig> of the 24ciona "unclassified adhesion" models had only the gps proteolytic domain in the n-termini. among the remaining three "unclassified adhesion" receptors, ci <dig> had a lrr domain while ci <dig> and ci <dig> protein models possess egf repeats in the n-termini.

a phylogenetic analysis of the ciona adhesion gpcrs was performed on the region from the tm  <dig> to tm  <dig> of the receptors. the analysis revealed that the ciona adhesion family clustered into five different groups each receiving more than  <dig> % bootstrap support in  nj trees . the five clusters were denoted as group i to group v. this group assignment of the adhesion gpcrs is ciona specific and is independent of the human adhesion groups referred to by bjarnadottir et.al.,  <dig>  <cit> .  <dig> ciona adhesion receptors could be included into these five groups reflecting a probable paralogous relationship between the groups. the remaining adhesion receptors remain as outgroups and do not cluster with sufficient phylogenetic support with other ciona members. the phylogenetic analysis indicates that ciona adhesion repertoire constitutes a very diverse set of receptors sharing relatively poor sequence identity . the three members in group iii share the least identity  while the two members in group v were the most identical . the group v receptors are presumably gene duplication events as evident from the high bootstrap support  of that node. three members belonging to group ii share  <dig> % identity, while the five members of the group i and the three members in group iv share  <dig> % and  <dig> % identities respectively. in all cases, only the identities within the tm regions were considered. group iv constitutes receptors that are orthologous to human lec/etl subfamily of receptors. in addition to the gene pair  in group v, our analysis also lends support to a hypothesis of two more probable gene duplication events for the tree nodes  and  . sequence alignment of the tm regions revealed that the ci0100130776/ci <dig> pair receptors were 57% identical while the ci0100134612/ci <dig> pair shares an identity of  <dig> %.

specialized tunicate gpcrs
our analysis revealed that the ciona genome contains at least two representatives that could not be classified as unambiguous orthologs of the grafs families. these include one receptor  that is similar to the protist dictyostelium camp/crl gpcr family and while the other receptor  is homologous to the insect related methuselah protein. the two ciona receptors cluster with the corresponding camp and methuselah gpcrs in a cross-genome phylogenetic analysis with a strong bootstrap support of  <dig> and  <dig> respectively,  in nj trees . camp receptors in dictyostelium discoideum mediate the coordinated aggregation of individual cells into a multi-cellular organism and regulate the expression levels of a number of developmentally regulated genes  <cit>  while crl receptors are implicated in cell growth regulation and tip formation in developing aggregates  <cit> . the methuselah gpcr in drosophila plays a role in ageing and increased resistance to several forms of stress including heat, starvation and oxidative damage  <cit> . the camp/crl receptors are believed to be represented exclusively in protists, plant and fungal kingdoms while the methuselah gpcr is thought to be present only in insects.

a blastp search for closest homolog of the ciona camp gpcr-like sequence in the non-redundant ncbi database revealed that the ciona sequence is most identical to predicted proteins in sea anemone   and danio rerio  with an overall sequence identity of 42% for both cases. the recovered nematostella sequence was observed to have only  <dig> tm regions. an alignment of the ciona receptor and its sea anemone homolog showed an identity of nearly 37% when only the tm regions were considered. among the dictyostelium camp/crl family members, the ciona sequence ci <dig> shows best identity with carc , while the best identity among the crl members is crla . likewise, a blastp search with the ciona methuselah-like homolog  with other insect genomes revealed that it is ~23% identical in the tm region to a mth 10-like receptor in the apis mellifera genome . however, the ectodomain that characterizes the drosophila methuselah gpcr is absent in the ciona homolog.

discussion
our phylogenetic analysis includes a collection of  <dig> putative ciona gpcr sequences and highlights in detail the remarkable level of orthology between the protochordate and vertebrate gpcrs. our analysis clearly suggests that a majority of the identified ciona gpcrs have a clear vertebrate and in particular, a human homolog at the level of the major grafs subfamilies. our results also show that at the individual gene level there are as many as  <dig> clear orthologs of human gpcrs in ciona . given that ciona possesses ancestral gpcr versions of the higher vertebral counterparts, there are also remarkable instances of lineage specific evolution as seen in the rhodopsin and adhesion families. from a protochordate perspective, the major differences from the human gpcrs in the ciona repertoire can be attributed to the presence of  <dig> "other rhodopsins", the ciona specific gene innovations of the ldlrr-gpcr cluster  and the unusually large adhesion family . the presence of many "unclassified/other" gpcrs for which reliable orthologs could not be identified  in other species, indicate that these are most likely ascidian specific genes. the other possibility is that these genes are evolving at a rapid rate, so much so that reliable orthologs could not be detected. in our final analysis and depiction of phylogenetic trees, we chose not to include these sets of "unclassified/other" sequences to avoid artefacts that can arise out of including sequences that are either evolving at a rapid rate or for which intermediate homologs could not be identified. instances of incomplete/poorly modelled genes can also be a cause for the failure to detect reliable homologs for many of these gpcrs. with further sequencing and analysis of gpcrs in other protochordate genomes, it is likely to become clear if these genes are indeed protochordate related diversifications.

our analysis of the ciona gpcr family suggests that while the number of adhesion receptors are comparable to that in vertebrates, the other gpcr families/subfamilies excepting that of the ldlrr-gpcrs, are represented at nearly  <dig> to  <dig> fold fewer numbers compared to the humans . this observation is only expected for a genome that is  <dig> times smaller than the human genome.

the rhodopsin family
among the rhodopsin receptors, the human α- and β-group subfamilies are analogously represented in ciona while among the seven subfamilies of the human γ- – and δ-groups, orthologs of the pur, classical chem, mchr and mrg receptor subfamilies could not be identified by phylogeny . simple blast searches identified many ciona receptors as being similar to chemokine receptor cluster, but they did not receive sufficient support in the phylogenetic analysis. these were annotated as "unclassifed chemokine receptor cluster-like". it is possible that these are highly divergent homologs of the chemokine receptor cluster genes. the absence of a clear classical chemokine  receptor ortholog in ciona agrees with previous finding that the evolution of chemokine receptors arose after the split of the vertebrates from the protochordate lineage  <cit> .

ciona has two representatives belonging to the prostaglandin receptor cluster. although drosophila has one remote homolog of a prostaglandin receptor, a readily recognizable homolog of a vertebrate-like prostaglandin is first observed only in the protochordate lineage. the sequence identities of ciona prostaglandin receptors with human ptger <dig> range from ~ <dig> – 23%. prostaglandin receptors mediate a wide variety of actions and play important physiological roles in the cardiovascular and immune systems and in pain sensation in peripheral systems  <cit> . reliable ests can be recovered from neural tissues for the ptger homolog  suggesting that these receptor homologs are involved in neural tissue physiology .

among the peptide receptors, ciona has a single copy of an authentic tachykinin receptor which has been proposed to play an important role in feeding and sexual behaviour of the ascidians  <cit> . furthermore, putative receptors for peptides like gnrh, cionin , oxytocin/arginine-vasopressin and hypocretin/orexin were recovered in ciona . among the ciona gpcrs the gnrh receptor remains the best studied and is the only known example of an authentic protochordate gonadotropin receptor to date  <cit> . a gnrhr- like protein in drosophila was later found to be activated by akh, a peptide structurally similar to gnrh, thus making ciona the only available protochordate model to possess authentic gnrhrs  <cit> . so far, three gnrhr-like ciona homologs have been found to be active in assays and are known to stimulate both the camp and ip <dig> signalling pathways. a cannabinoid receptor homolog  and a receptor  that is most closely related to the lysophospholipid receptors were also identified. we could not recover cannabinoid receptor homologs from the genomes of protostomes, while homologs were found in echinoderms suggesting that these receptors have their origins in a common deuterostomal ancestor to echinoderms and chordates. ests for the edg homolog  were recovered from blood cells/haemocytes suggesting that these receptors may have a role in the nervous system similar to that observed for vertebrate edg receptors  <cit> .

structural innovations in the ciona ldlrr/lgr-like/glhr rhodopsin cluster
ciona shows a notable lineage specific gene innovation and gene expansion  of the ldlrr-gpcrs . these receptors have tm regions that are homologous to vertebrate insl3/relaxin binding gpcrs. lineage specific gene expansions have long been observed in several cases including that of the opsin and fish odorant receptor expansions in puffer fish  <cit>  and trace amine receptor expansion in zebrafish  <cit> . the ldlrr-gpcr subfamily in ciona displays an unusual combination of ldl-a domain tandem repeats in the n-termini. although the presence of a single ldl-a domain in gpcrs was first observed in mammals, our unpublished study shows that the ldl-a domain repeats in gpcrs exist in protostomes  and in early deuterostomes like echinoderms  and ciona suggesting that the origin of these receptors can be traced back to a common bilateral ancestor. the presence of ldl-a repeats in mosaic proteins has long been known and is an example that supports the exon shuffling theory  <cit> .

based on phylogeny and domain architecture analysis we propose that while the signatures for the ldl-a domain and lrr domain containing rhodopsin subfamily first arose in a bilateral metazoan ancestor, this subfamily has undergone several lineage specific innovations at the level of the combinations and tandem repeats of these domains. our analysis suggests that the  <dig> ciona ldlrr-gpcrs  have evolved divergently as a group . this divergence is evident in the phylogenetic analysis of the tm regions of this group with those of the snail and human lgrs . it is possible that changes in the tm regions presumably accommodates for the changes that have occurred in the ciona primary ligand binding n-terminal region that contain ldl-a domains but lack lrrs.

in vertebrate insl3/relaxin binding gpcrs, a combination of a single cysteine-rich ldl-a domain and multiple lrrs at the ectodomain site is necessary for ligand binding, receptor activation and further downstream signalling from these receptors  <cit> . receptors that lack the ldl-a domain were found to bind relaxin, but were unable to effect camp accumulation  <cit> . the lrr region in the ectodomain is essential for binding of glycoprotein hormones  <cit> . notwithstanding the incomplete sequence information in the case of the  <dig> "unclassified lgr-like" sequences that do not have any identifiable domains at the n-termini, it is evident that the architecture of the  <dig> confirmed ciona ldlrr-gpcrs that lack lrr domains is very different from vertebrate type c lgrs . these receptors are thus functionally unrelated to vertebrate insl3/relaxin peptide binding receptors.

a typical cysteine-rich ldl-a domain found in human ldl receptor and human ldl receptor related protein  consists of ~ <dig> amino acids containing six cysteine residues at fixed positions with the region between the fifth and sixth cysteines rich in aspartic and glutamic acid residues. these acidic residues in ldl receptors are known to interact with basic amino acids in lipoproteins  <cit> . the human ldl receptor contains at least  <dig> class a repeats  <cit>  while the lrps contain clusters of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> repeats  <cit> . furthermore, in the lrps, these repeats bind to large protein complexes like the α <dig> macroglobulin-protease complexes and urokinase-type plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor   <cit> . a majority of ldl-a-like repeats in the  <dig> ciona ldlrr-gpcrs conform to the classical ldl-a repeat structure. it is thus tempting to speculate that these domains are crucial for the specific function of the receptors and that these receptors likely bind to lipoproteins or large protein complexes as ligands, analogous to the classical human ldl receptor. this hypothesis based on comparative domain analysis may serve as a pointer towards further molecular studies. a similar hypothesis that the snail grl <dig> receptor which contains both ldl-a and lrr repeats might be a member of a putative class of gpcrs that directly transduce signals carried by large extracellular protein s, has been proposed earlier  <cit> . the differences between the snail lgr-like and the ciona ldlrr-gpcrs lie in the possibility that the snail receptor which contains lrrs can potentially offer a different ligand presentation mechanism compared to the ciona receptors that lack lrrs.

although direct evidence of lipoproteins as gpcr signalling agents is not available, previous evidence suggests that ldl molecules at physiological concentrations can activate phosphatidylinositol signalling and mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores in the absence of ldl receptor mediation  <cit> . similarly, hdl stimulation of camp formation has also been demonstrated  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, no authentic gpcr has been demonstrated to bind to lipoproteins as signalling molecules and therefore it should be a crucial step forward to de-orphanize this family of gpcrs in ciona. a search of the ciona est database for matches to the novel ciona ldlrr-gpcr protein models revealed that a majority of the hits are derived from the blood tissue and haemocytes . identification of three putative ciona orthologs of vertebrate insl-relaxin-like genes has recently been reported  <cit> . furthermore, the authors hypothesize that the ciona insl/rln orthologs most likely interacts with a ciona rtk-receptor and not a gpcr and the receptor switch from rtk-receptor to a gpcr occurred after the split of ciona from the common lineage leading to the vertebrates  <cit> . from our own analysis of the  <dig> ciona receptors in the ldlrr-gpcr/lgr-like/glhr cluster, we found two lrr bearing lgr-like sequences . conserved domain searches of these two receptors further narrowed down only one candidate insl3/relaxin receptor-like  sequence. a phylogenetic analysis of ciona sequence  with vertebrate type c insl3/relaxin receptors  revealed that the ciona receptor is not orthologous to vertebrate type c lgrs and is therefore unlikely to bind to vertebrate insl3/relaxin versions. our analysis does not however exclude the possibility that the two lgr-like ciona sequences  can bind to the ciona insl-relaxin orthologs.

the ciona gpcr adhesome
unlike vertebrates which possess multiple functional adhesion n-terminal domains that include lectin, cadherin and laminin domains among others, the ciona gpcr adhesome possesses a less complex domain organisation with a single gps domain in  <dig> out of  <dig> receptors. furthermore, these receptors did not correspond with any clear ortholog in other vertebrates. orthologs for the vertebrate celsr, lec, gp123-gp <dig> and he <dig> class of receptors could be observed but orthologs of other adhesion members previously documented in human are missing.

the ligands and biological functions of adhesion gpcrs are largely unknown. orthologs belonging to the celsr, he <dig> and gp123/124/ <dig> subfamilies have only a single representative in ciona making it an interesting model for studying the roles of these gpcrs. the celsr family of gpcrs in mammals play a possible functional role in the developmental processes of the brain and the peripheral nervous system  <cit> . although a search of the ciona est database did not reveal any analogous distribution of celsr homologs in neural tissues, this does not necessarily exclude its expression in these regions. the ciona celsr model showed maximum  identity with human celsr <dig> while displaying a remarkable level of conservation in the n-terminal domain architecture. the ciona celsr homolog contains  <dig> cadherin domain repeats,  <dig> laminin g-like motifs,  <dig> laminin egf-like motif,  <dig> egf-like calcium binding motifs and the characteristic gps domain identical to that in human celsr <dig> 

among mammalian lec receptors, lec <dig> and lec <dig> expression is abundant in the brain tissue  <cit> . lec <dig> binds to α-latrotoxin and has a role in exocytosis of the synaptic vesicles  <cit> . the other vertebrate lec homologs are unable to function as a-latrotoxin receptors and their physiological roles remain unknown. ciona also has at least three phylogenetically identifiable lec homologs for which reliable ests can be recovered from the gastrula and neurula, cleavage stage embryo and tail-bud embryo developmental stages suggestive of a role for these receptors in developmental processes . it should be interesting to explore the presence of lec homologs in neural tissues of ciona to compare biochemical roles of lec gpcr biology between vertebrates and protochordates. as many as three gene duplication events can be suspected in the ciona gpcr adhesome . ciona can be a very good model where the developmental role of adhesion orthologs can be investigated at the single cell level because the larvae contain approximately  <dig> cells and the lineage of the embryonic cells giving rise to different tissue types has been well determined  <cit> .

the camp gpcr-like and methuselah-like gpcr in ciona
the camp/crl gpcrs belong to an ancient family of gpcrs with homologs observed in the protists, fungi and plants as reported in the pfam database  <cit> . however, authentic camp gpcrs have been characterized only in the protist dictyotelium discoideum  <cit> . the ciona camp gpcr-like sequence shows best identity with predicted hypothetical proteins in danio rerio and nematostella vectensis. the top hit in a search with the ciona camp gpcr-like sequence  in the prints database was the dictyostelium camp receptors  with matches for  <dig> out of  <dig> sequence motifs and an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  <cit> . the next best hit was the gabab gpcr of the glutamate family with matches for  <dig> out of  <dig> sequence motifs and an e-value of  <dig>  a recent study on the gpcr repertoire in the branchiostoma floridae genome reports two camp gpcr-like sequences with limited sequence identities  <cit> . the ests for the methuselah-like sequence  were found only in the adult digestive gland suggesting a possible role for this gpcr in digestive processes. .

although the putative non-grafs ciona gpcrs ci <dig> and ci <dig> cluster with camp and methuselah gpcr families with significant bootstrap support, they share only limited sequence identities  with homologous members of their respective families. evidently, sequence homology at these levels does not imply functional homology. it is possible that these sequences are highly divergent homologs of the camp and methuselah gpcr families. the recovery of ciona ests for both receptors confirmed that these genes are endogenously expressed. .

gpcr orthologs of human disease genes
ciona has representatives of gpcrs that are associated with diseases in humans. among the  <dig> monogenic gpcr disease genes known to date, ciona has orthologs of  <dig> receptors . the motivation for identification of these gpcr orthologs is to facilitate the conception of studies that will have implications for human health. for example, the mammalian casr gene is known to be expressed in parathyroid glands and its loss in parathyroid gland in mice is implicated in hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism and growth retardation  <cit> . similarly, monogenic mutations of the pthr <dig> gene is known to be involved in chondrodysplasia and multi-organ disorders, while monogenic mutants of vasopressin receptor  are implicated in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus  <cit> . est matches for casr, pthr <dig> and avpr <dig> orthologs can be recovered in ciona . the tunicate can thus prove an excellent model to probe the roles of these genes. although physiological roles of these receptors may differ between humans and ciona, studying their roles at the biochemical and genetic level in ciona will potentially pave the way for a better understanding of its vertebrate counterparts.

the list of top hits among ciona genes in a blastp search against human disease related gpcrs. the list is based on an e-value cut-off of ≤1e- <dig> and further verification by phylogenetic analysis. the ciona matches were checked for their alignment with the human proteins over the length of the tm region. swiss-prot identifiers are reported for the human gpcrs.

sequence conservation of ciona pthrs
a particular instance of orthology that will provide clues for the physiological roles of ancestral gpcrs is the pthr orthologs in ciona that share a high sequence identity with both vertebrate pthr- <dig> and pthr- <dig>  pthr-1-ligand interactions and their mechanism of action in vertebrates are well understood. pthr- <dig> is abundantly expressed in bones and kidney and is known to play an important role in mediating pth regulated mineral ion homeostasis and endochondral bone formation  <cit> . mutations in vertebrate pthrs and ligands are linked to a number of genetic diseases affecting skeletal development and calcium homeostasis  <cit> . hence, the discovery of homologs for these receptors in a protochordate system is of special interest. unlike pthr- <dig>  which is ubiquitously expressed, pthr- <dig> is expressed in brain, testis, placenta and cardiac endothelium. the physiological roles of pthr- <dig> however, are not clearly established  <cit> .

a multiple sequence alignment of ciona pthrs with those of vertebrates reveal several conserved motifs . the sequence conservation across many functionally important residues responsible for ligand binding and downstream g-protein coupling makes it likely that the putative ciona pthrs can cross-react specifically with mammalian pth/pth related peptides and can signal downstream by coupling to g-proteins. interestingly, ciona pthr homologs exhibit high sequence conservation across sites known to be associated with blomstrand's  <cit>  and jansen's syndrome in humans  <cit> . the absence of defined n- and c-terminal regions in ciona pthr homologs again seem to be a result of incomplete modelling and a clear picture should emerge with further refinement of the genome or through experimental studies. information from the existing protein models  should prove useful for performing experiments addressing the physiological roles of these receptors in a protochordate and its evolution in subsequent lineages.

CONCLUSIONS
a genome-wide analysis of the repertoire of putative gpcrs in ciona intestinalis was carried out, revealing many intriguing aspects of ascidian gpcr evolution. while as many as 39% of ciona gpcr sequences are orthologous to vertebrate gpcr subfamilies, a substantial number seem to represent invertebrate-chordate related diversification. the observation of orthologs of several gpcrs related to vertebrate heart and neural tissue physiology raises the possibility that genetic studies of ciona gpcrs can be exploited to assess the functions of complementary higher vertebrate genes. the availability of ciona est hits with matches for  <dig> of the  <dig> putative gpcrs will facilitate further studies to elucidate their functional roles. the compact gpcr repertoire in the ciona model also presents fewer complications in terms of functional redundancy and offers an advantage to study the evolution and function of these receptors. in summary, our analysis leads the way towards understanding the invertebrate-chordate gpcr signalling system and helps identify candidate vertebrate gpcr homologs in ciona to be selected for functional studies.
