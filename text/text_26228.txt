BACKGROUND
xenoantibodies represent a subset of natural antibodies that are present in normal humans as a consequence of our natural immune defense to infectious agents. these antibodies are evolutionarily conserved and can be classified into small groups on the basis of binding specificity and canonical structure  <cit> . the majority of xenoantibodies that initiate the rejection of porcine xenografts obtained from wild-type donors are specific for the α-gal epitope   <cit> . in normal humans, non-human primates and galactosyltransferase knockout mice, these antibodies are encoded by a small number of germline genes  <cit> . the availability and design of genetically-engineered donor organs has more recently led to the opportunity to study humoral responses that initiate acute xenograft rejection. xenoantibodies mediating this process in response to placement of hdaf-transgenic organs are encoded by germline progenitors that are identical to those encoding xenoantibodies induced in response to wild-type pig organs, albeit at a delayed tempo  <cit> . in humans and non-human primates, these germline progenitors are alleles of ighv3- <dig>  <cit> . in galactosyltransferase-deficient mice, a clonal expansion of antibodies encoded by the germline progenitor vhj <dig> occurs following graft placement  <cit> . the molecular basis for this restriction is not understood.

genetically-modified donor organs do not induce hyperacute rejection, but acute vascular rejection still occurs  <cit> . the possibility that alternative carbohydrates may be relevant targets of induced antibody responses to genetically-modified xenografts has raised an interest in the structure and functional characteristics of anti-carbohydrate antibodies  <cit> . natural xenoantibodies are encoded by a small number of germline progenitors with affinities for the gal carbohydrate that vary substantially  <cit> . the avidity of these antibodies for the gal carbohydrate does not increase following perfusion through porcine livers  <cit>  but xenoantibodies produced in patients exposed to porcine islets do demonstrate an increase in affinity for the gal carbohydrate over time  <cit> . natural antibodies and induced xenoantibodies in baboons do not differ in affinity for the gal carbohydrate  <cit> , but rodent monoclonal anti-carbohydrate antibodies with mutations and a higher affinity for the gal carbohydrate can reject xenografts at an accelerated tempo  <cit> . the association between xenoantibody structure, somatic mutation and function during the progression of the immune response, in vivo, remains unclear. it has been postulated that the canonical structure of the germline progenitor plays a key role in the specificity of select antibodies for carbohydrates  <cit> . high resolution crystallography has shown that anti-carbohydrate antibodies in germline configuration can recognize a range of structurally-related carbohydrate epitopes  <cit> . antibodies that bind to gal and structurally-related non-gal carbohydrates may therefore be encoded by the same group of germline progenitors. the relevance of this to the xenoantibody response is that accurate structural information defining xenoantibodies may be used to identify small molecular inhibitors that target anti-carbohydrate xenoantibodies and may enhance xenograft survival in multiple settings in which induced antibody-mediated responses prevent long-term graft survival.

our laboratory has defined a select, restricted usage of igvh genes that encode xenoantibodies in multiple settings. these antibodies have a unique canonical structure that is conserved across species  <cit> . by performing a detailed analysis of the sequence of igvh genes encoding xenoantibodies expressed in patients and large animals mounting active immune responses to pig cells, an understanding of the three dimensional configuration of the xenoantibody/gal binding site can now be determined. in addition, sites of recurring mutations in vivo can be placed in context of carbohydrate/xenoantibody binding sites that can be predicted using computer-simulated models. this information provides a novel and important link in the development of reagents that can block anti-carbohydrate xenoantibodies that induce xenograft rejection.

in this manuscript, the structural basis of carbohydrate/xenoantibody interaction has been defined by sequence information comparing germline and mutated xenoantibodies. a computer-simulated model has been generated to define the unique structure of induced xenoantibodies in humans and non-human primates. specific sites relevant for optimal xenoantibody/carbohydrate interaction have been identified and the role of somatic mutation in vivo at these sites during induced antibody responses can now be studied to provide insight on the role of mutations in the progression of the xenoantibody response. our data suggest that the configuration of the xenoantibody binding pocket of the small group of igm antibodies expanded during hyperacute and acute rejection responses is similar. five contact sites within the heavy chain and the cdr <dig> region play a role in optimal xenoantibody/gal carbohydrate binding.

RESULTS
exposure of patients to pig cells stimulates an increase in the expression of antibodies encoded by the vh4- <dig> germline progenitor
we have used an anchor-elisa pcr analysis to demonstrate that xenoantibodies are predominantly encoded by genes in the in the vh <dig> family and a smaller proportion of these antibodies are encoded by genes in the vh <dig> family  <cit> . the production of cdna libraries from the peripheral blood of patients mounting active xenograft responses has allowed us to apply colony filter hybridization and nucleic acid sequencing to identify the germline progenitors encoding these antibodies. we identified the ighv3- <dig> and ighv3- <dig> germline genes as the progenitors of xenoantibodies produced by the vh <dig> family of immunoglobulin genes, however the progenitors encoding xenoantibodies in the vh <dig> family were not previously identified. to complete the structural analysis of immunoglobulin genes encoding xenoantibodies, we produced five vh <dig> cdna libraries from peripheral blood samples obtained from patients mounting active xenoantibody responses to pig cells. the cdna libraries were used to determine whether an increase in gene expression associated with any of the germline progenitors in the vh <dig> family could be identified when comparing ig gene usage in patients prior to and following exposure to pig cells. on the basis of immunoglobulin gene sequencing of  <dig> genes in each library, the relative expression of the vh4- <dig> germline gene was increased from 5–8% at day  <dig> to 43–44% at day  <dig> post-xenoantigen exposure. the nucleotide and animo acid sequence of six of these genes is shown in figure  <dig>  the genes encoding igm xenoantibodies in the vh <dig> family, similar to those encoding vh <dig> xenoantibodies, are expressed in germline configuration. we have previously reported that xenoantibodies encoded by the vh <dig> family are structurally-related and can be placed in one of seven structural classes of immunoglobulin genes  <cit> . xenoantibodies in the vh <dig> family are characterized by a 1- <dig> canonical structure. this data indicates that the shape of the binding pocket of this small group of antibodies differs from that encoded by the ighv3- <dig> germline genes.

the dpk <dig> and hsigkv <dig> germline genes are used to encode the light chain of xenoantibodies
in humans and non-human primates, a restricted group of genes encodes the heavy chain of xenoantibodies, but information on light chain genes is very limited. due to insufficient sequence information, the determination as to whether a similar restriction in light chain gene usage occurs cannot be made, nor can accurate molecular models of xenoantibodies be generated. we have previously shown that xenoantibodies encoded by the ighv3- <dig> igvh germline progenitor can bind to the gal carbohydrate when paired with the dpk <dig> light chain gene  <cit> . in non-human primates, the light chain genes encoding xenoantibodies have not been defined. we therefore prepared cdna libraries from peripheral blood samples of non-human primates mounting active xenoantibody responses following exposure to porcine hepatocytes or heart xenografts. our earlier studies showed that the ighv3- <dig> germline progenitor encodes xenoantibodies in these non-human primates  <cit> , and the same samples were now used to identify the light chain genes expressed at this time. serum samples were initially used to verify that an induced xenoantibody response could be documented by elisa and cells were used to produce a series of cdna libraries  <cit> . we prepared  <dig> cdna libraries from rhesus monkeys prior to and at day  <dig> following exposure to pig cells to identify the germline progenitors encoding light chains. the relative frequency of ig gene usage by individual germline progenitors was determined by sequencing  <dig> random clones from each library. the results indicate that xenoantibodies expressed at day  <dig> were encoded by a restricted number of germline progenitors. the closest matching human germline genes were dpk <dig> and hsigkv <dig> in the vk i family . the closest matching germline sequences in the rhesus monkey were igkv1f and igkv1z which showed 95% and 93% nucleic acid sequence homology with the day  <dig> post-transplant rhesus monkey genes encoding xenoantibodies  <cit> . to date, little information is available on vh and vl germline genes in non-human primates. the rhesus germline light chain genes are members of the v kappa  <dig> subgroup and are of the same canonical structural class as human light chain genes encoding single chain antibodies that bind to the gal carbohydrate. the same germline progenitors were used to encode light chains in xenoantibodies induced following immunization with porcine hepatocytes or transplantation with porcine heart xenografts. this information was used in the computer-simulated model to complete our analysis of the binding site configuration in xenoantibodies selected for expansion in primates.

computer-simulated modeling of the xenoantibody/gal binding pocket
the structure of the binding site was addressed using computer-simulated molecular models generated by homology modeling . computer-assisted homology-based modeling provides a reliable method of defining the three-dimensional structure of the binding pocket of xenoantibodies. using this methodology, antibodies whose structure has been defined by crystallography can be used as a template for structural studies on an antibody of interest. three-dimensional structural data obtained by modeling with homology-based techniques agrees well when compared with data determined by x-ray crystallographic techniques  <cit> . we used the autodock and dock programs for our model to identify contact sites relevant for xenoantibody binding to the gal carbohydrate ,  <cit> . key contact sites relevant for optimal xenoantibody/gal carbohydrate interaction were identified by docking the gal carbohydrate in trisaccharide and pentasaccharide forms into the computer-simulated model of the ighv3- <dig> xenoantibody. energy scores were computed and the model selected on the basis of the lowest energy conformation. the results of the computer-assisted model indicate that the light chain, heavy chain and cdr <dig> region each contribute to gal saccharide binding. key contact sites include positions 31and  <dig> of the cdr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the cdr <dig>  and 99– <dig> of the cdr <dig>  positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the light chain also contribute to optimal binding to gal tri and pentasaccharide. induced xenoantibodies and antibodies that demonstrate the ability to bind to carbohydrates have a structurally-similar binding pocket . interestingly, mutations identified in vivo in igg xenoantibodies expressed in patients undergoing active xenoantibody responses occur at several predicted contact sites . mutations located in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the heavy chain of igg xenoantibodies were identified in both humans and non-human primates mounting active xenoantibody responses .

the affinity of xenoantibodies for the gal carbohydrate can be altered by site-directed mutations
the cdr <dig> region, identified as important for xenoantibody/gal carbohydrate interaction in the molecular model, is identical in xenoantibodies induced in patients and non-human primates  <cit> . interestingly, the cdr <dig> sequence of the anti-gal monoclonal antibody  <dig>  that identifies the residual gal carbohydrate encoded by the igb3s gene following knockout of the galactosyltransferase gene also utilizes this cdr <dig> region  <cit> . we selected this site for site-directed mutagenesis to create a mutation in position  <dig>  in the xenoantibody encoded by ighv3- <dig> to address whether the affinity of antigen/antibody interaction would be altered by this modification. the replacement of an aspartic acid with a serine residue was accomplished by overlap extension pcr. the gene was sequenced to confirm that the correct mutation was introduced in the desired location. site-specific mutations were also introduced at sites  <dig> and  <dig> within the cdr <dig>  site  <dig> is frequently mutated in igg xenoantibodies expressed in patients and in non-human primates . the ability of the mutated antibodies to bind to gal and block human natural antibody binding to purified gal pentasaccharide was measured using an elisa assay. the results show that the introduction of a mutation in position  <dig> improved the ability of the single chain antibodies to block human natural antibody binding to purified gal, whereas mutations at other sites were less effective .

binding affinity is not altered by somatic mutations in igg genes encoding xenoantibodies in patients following bal treatment
igm xenoantibodies directed at the gal carbohydrate in human patients treated with a bioartificial liver hepatic support device  containing pig cells are initially expressed in the absence of somatic mutation  <cit> . igg xenoantibodies that are detected by day  <dig> demonstrate mutations in approximately 67% of the clones sequenced. these mutations were not localized to the cdr regions of the antibodies  <cit> . sites at which mutations were identified in vivo in libraries of igg clones encoding xenoantibodies at day  <dig> after xenoantigen exposure included positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the amino acid substitutions resulting from these mutations included the substitution of a serine with an asparagine residue at position  <dig> , a tyrosine for an alanine or a phenylalanine at position  <dig>  and changes at position  <dig> and  <dig> for neutral amino acids which were either polar or non-polar. in order to study the biological role of the occurrence of mutations that were identified in antibodies produced in patients mounting active anti-gal xenoantibody responses to pig cells, the igvh gene  in germline and somatically-mutated forms was cloned from the peripheral blood of patient samples and expressed as single chain xenoantibodies using the vector  . the light chain gene used in these constructs was the dpκ <dig> germline progenitor . single chain antibodies encoded by ighv3- <dig> bind to the gal carbohydrate in vitro when expressed in germline configuration, indicating that specificity for this carbohydrate is inherent in the binding pocket formed by the ighv3- <dig> heavy chain and dpk <dig> light chain. soluble single chain xenoantibodies expressed in germline and somatically mutated forms were compared for their ability to bind to pig cells and block human natural antibody binding to cells of xenogeneic origin . preincubation with soluble antibodies results in inhibition of human natural igm and igg antibody binding to pig endothelial cells, ranging from 56–71%, as measured by flow cytometry. germline and somatically-mutated antibodies demonstrated no significant differences in the ability of equivalent concentrations of soluble single chain antibodies to block human xenoantibody binding to pig cells . the relative affinity of the germline form of the antibody for the purified gal carbohydrate in pentasaccharide form was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m, compared with 2– <dig> × 10- <dig> m when  <dig> amino acid substitutions were introduced during the evolution of the immune response of antibodies encoded by the ighv3- <dig> germline progenitor . the affinity for the gal carbohydrate remained in the 10- <dig> m range despite the presence of mutations in genes encoding igg xenoantibodies in these patients.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
xenoantibodies that initiate the rejection of porcine xenografts are included under the broad classification of "natural antibodies" in humans  <cit> . natural antibodies are believed to play a primary role in defense against pathogens before specific antibodies are produced by the immune system. for many years, natural antibodies were defined as polyreactive antibodies that bind to multiple target antigens such as nucleic acids, proteins and polysaccharides with low-to-moderate affinity  <cit> . more recently, high-affinity, monospecific natural antibodies have been identified that bind to a single target with kinetic constants similar to those observed for immune antibodies. monospecific natural antibodies may be expressed in germline configuration  <cit> , raising the intriguing possibility that the specificity of groups of natural antibodies is inherent in the structural configuration of the binding site  <cit> .

our laboratory has been studying the structure, sequence, and germline origin of xenoantibodies in several models of xenograft rejection. a small number of closely-related ig genes that are evolutionarily conserved in structure encode xenoantibodies when expressed in germline configuration in all species studied to date  <cit> . the repertoire of pre-existing anti-gal antibodies that is present in normal individuals in the absence of immune stimulation, has been demonstrated in several experimental settings to include antibodies encoded by a relatively small number of germline progenitors. knockout mice and patients mounting active immune responses to porcine xenografts demonstrate a selective expansion of anti-gal antibodies encoded by one or two germline progenitors from the available repertoire  <cit> . the molecular basis for the expansion of xenoantibodies encoded by selected germline progenitors from a larger repertoire of pre-existing natural xenoantibodies with the ability to bind to the gal carbohydrate is not understood. clarification of the structural requirements for optimal xenoantibody gal/carbohydrate interaction may provide insight into the process by which xenoantibodies that mediate the rejection of porcine xenografts are recruited. furthermore, this information may be directly used to develop new strategies or optimize existing strategies for preventing xenoantibody/carbohydrate interaction  <cit> .

in humans, anti-gal xenoantibodies are predominantly encoded by a small group of vh <dig> genes  <cit> . antibodies selected for expansion in patients mounting anti-gal responses can be classified into one of the seven canonical structural groups for igvh genes  <cit> , and display a well-defined structural conformation of the binding pocket. the evolutionary conservation of antibodies with this structure suggests they play a role in host defense  <cit> . the presence of the gal carbohydrate on certain types of enteric bacteria provides a basis for the selection, retention, and redundance in the ability of the immune system to initiate an antibody response with this defined specificity  <cit> . we have established that somatic mutation is not required for xenoantibody binding to the gal carbohydrate  <cit> . igg xenoantibodies induced in humans at day  <dig> post-bal display mutations that are neither localized in the cdr regions of the xenoantibodies nor do they significantly enhance the binding of xenoantibodies to purified gal pentasaccharide  <cit> . mutations do not appear in key sites that determine the canonical structure of anti-gal antibodies, or if they do occur, are not selected for in xenoantibodies expanded in response to pig cells  <cit> . this data is consistent with the findings of dehoux et al. who demonstrate that no significant difference in the affinity of natural antibodies that mediate hyperacute rejection and those that initiate acute vascular rejection of porcine kidney xenografts could be demonstrated  <cit> . in these baboons, an isotype switch occurs that is associated with an increase in all igg subclasses, especially igg <dig> but no increase in the affinity of igg xenoantibodies for the gal carbohydrate. similarly, cotterell et al have reported that the avidity of human igm xenoantibodies before and after perfusion through porcine livers remains unchanged  <cit> . the affinity of xenoantibodies that bind to the gal carbohydrate in baboons and humans is generally between 1– <dig> × 10- <dig> for igm and igg xenoantibodies, but may vary within the range of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> m as reported by several groups  <cit> . antibodies produced in humans transplanted with porcine islet cells demonstrate an increase in affinity for the gal carbohydrate from  <dig> × 10- <dig> m to  <dig> × 10- <dig> m, suggesting that an affinity maturation response occurred in these patients over several months time  <cit> . affinity maturation may therefore not be evident in several settings until sometime later than  <dig> weeks post-transplantation  <cit> , however in the interim, acute vascular rejection can occur. since affinity of natural anti-gal xenoantibodies selected for expansion in human patients post-transplantation is relatively high when expressed in germline configuration in naïve individuals, our data suggests that polyreactive xenoantibodies with binding affinities within the order of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> are not relevant for xenograft reactions.

on the basis of this information, and sequence data obtained from multiple models of xenograft rejection that have been studied in our laboratory, we have formulated the hypothesis that a unique structural configuration  defines igm and igg xenoantibodies directed at pig cells and/or xenografts in the presence or absence of somatic mutation  <cit> . the concept that the shape of an antigen binding site is specialized to conform to specific types of antigen/antibody interactions, in general, was originally proposed by lara-ochoa et al.  <cit> . interestingly, recent studies have indicated that although a potentially large combination of canonical structures is possible, only a few are selected and utilized in the human antibody repertoire  <cit> . specifically, out of  <dig> possible canonical structural combinations, only ten are preferentially used. the process of molecular recognition, therefore, may begin with a basic recognition of an antigen with a defined shape by small numbers of germline progenitors with a specific main chain structural conformation. this first stage of antigen/antibody recognition, proposed to be the basis for the evolutionary selection of small groups of structurally-related antibodies, may provide an explanation for the well-documented restriction in immunoglobulin genes encoding xenoantibodies. antigen/antibody interaction initiated by binding to antibodies with a select main-chain conformation, followed by a second stage of selection for antibodies with specific amino acids in key contact sites within the hypervariable region sequence that are relevant for optimal for xenoantibody/gal interaction is a concept consistent with our data. in humans, anti-gal antibodies in unimmunized individuals are encoded by a group of 6– <dig> well-defined and structurally-related germline progenitors  <cit> . exposure to pig cells in humans, monkeys or mice results in the selective expansion of xenoantibodies encoded by one or two of these germline genes  <cit> . the basis for this second stage of selection may be clarified by a detailed analysis of the structure of the xenoantibody/gal binding site  <cit> . amino acids in specific contact sites defined by computer-simulated models may play a role in the selection of antibodies for expansion. in other types of natural antibody/antigen interactions, such as binding to single-stranded dna and insulin, single amino acid mutations have the ability to significantly increase the affinity and/or alter the specificity of the antibody  <cit> . seemingly minor changes in amino acids located in key contact sites relevant for xenoantibody/gal carbohydrate interaction may dramatically modify natural antibody responses. the identification of key contact sites and the application of this information to understanding the role of mutations in xenoantibodies that mediate the rejection of porcine xenografts would provide a solution to the controversy regarding the functional role of mutations in delayed xenograft rejection.

although contact sites are best defined by crystallography, computer-simulated modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis has been used successfully to define the sites critical for antibody/antigen interaction  <cit> . the construction of engineered antibodies and three-dimensional models representing antigen/antibody interaction defines the binding site of each unique antigen/antibody interaction in a way that cannot be done using sequence information alone. at the three-dimensional level, the unique folding of cdr and framework segments mutually influence each other's conformation. the structural repertoire of the cdr is characterized by a finite number of main chain conformations, yet the differences in key amino acids within the cdr contribute to the generation of a large number of antibodies with varied topologies. the wide diversity in antigen binding specificities is attributed largely, but not exclusively, to variation in surface features of the cdr  <cit> . antigen binding involves multiple non-covalent interactions between atoms in the antigen and the cdr surface, although only about one third to one fifth of the cdr surface participates directly in antigen contact  <cit> . the generation of computer-simulated models provides a method to identify specific contact sites unique to each antibody/antigen interaction. the information gathered from these models is broadly applicable in antibody engineering, antigen docking and in structure-based drug design.

we have applied computer-simulated techniques to create a model of xenoantibody/gal carbohydrate interaction. the model has identified xenoantibody/gal pentasaccharide binding sites at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the light chain,  <dig> and  <dig> of the cdr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the cdr <dig> and 99– <dig> within the cdr <dig> region of the heavy chain. site-directed mutagenesis at a single site was demonstrated to alter the affinity of xenoantibody binding to the gal carbohydrate, as suggested by the model, however, the affinity of the xenoantibodies remain in the 10- <dig> m range in the presence or absence of mutations in vivo. functional analysis of anti-gal xenoantibodies cloned from cdna libraries prepared from the peripheral blood of patients mounting active xenoantibody responses indicates that high affinity xenoantibodies are not produced in vivo in patients at day  <dig> following at least two exposures to pig cells in the bioartificial liver hepatic support device. although this could be attributable to the method and/or length of exposure of these patients to porcine cells, it is equally possible that somatic mutation does not contribute to any appreciable increase in binding affinity for antibodies that mediate the xenograft rejection response. precedent for the latter possibility has been shown to occur in other types of antibodies that play a key role in rapid defense responses, such as protective antibodies produced in response to viruses and antibodies that mediate human immune responses to haemophilus influenzae b capsular polysaccharide  <cit> . antibodies directed at pathogenic agents with repetitive antigenic determinants demonstrate high affinity binding determined exclusively by specific germline vh and vl combinations in the absence of mutations and have similar binding affinities when expressed in germline and somatically-mutated configurations  <cit> . ongoing pressure therefore exists to conserve the germline configuration of the variable region of these antibodies  <cit> . our studies indicate that xenoantibodies respond in a manner that is very similar to other evolutionarily-selected antibodies that play a role in innate defense.

contact sites for carbohydrate/xenoantibody interaction predicted by molecular models include amino acids within the third complementarity determining region of the heavy chain. the cdr <dig> is characterized by a large diversity in amino acid composition and length. classification of these loops into canonical forms has been difficult due to this large variation in composition  <cit> . to date, thirteen canonical forms have been defined for the cdr <dig> region of immunoglobulin heavy chains. these forms represent a combination of a specific take-off geometry and specific apex, and are classified according to sequence motif, intra-loop interaction and/or main chain geometry. although the loop take-off angle and specific apex geometry are important for defining the structure of the cdr <dig> segment, the plasticity of the antibody response ensures that select conformational structures may be achieved by multiple mechanisms. our sequence information and molecular modeling data suggests that the cdr <dig> of xenoantibodies induced in response to exposure to pig cells is restricted in structure and contributes to antibody specificity. molecular modeling of the ighv3- <dig> antibody docked to the gal carbohydrate indicates that amino acids in positions 99– <dig>  are important for xenoantibody/gal interaction. consistent with most antigen-antibody interactions, contacts at the end of the loop closer to the center of the combining site contribute to the specificity of xenoantibody/gal interactions. in humans and non-human primates mounting active xenoantibody responses, this cdr <dig> is selectively utilized in xenoantibodies that are expanded in response to porcine hepatocyte, heart and islet transplantation  <cit> . in patients, vh and vl germline genes encoding antibodies with a specific light chain, heavy chain and cdr <dig> are recruited in response to pig cell exposure. although this pattern of antibody selection may be driven by a specific type of xenoantigen presentation and/or the time of exposure to porcine xenoantigens, a similar pattern of selection has been defined in knockout mice exposed to solid organ xenografts  <cit> . this restriction suggests that antibodies binding to carbohydrates are further selected on the basis of usage of specific cdr <dig> and j regions.

the significance of the xenoantibodies encoded by the vh4- <dig> germline progenitor has yet to be determined. although xenoantibodies encoded by the ighv3- <dig> germline progenitor encode most of the induced xenoantibodies in humans and non-human primates mounting active xenoantibody responses to xenografts from wild-type pigs, the minor population of xenoantibodies encoded by the vh <dig> family could bind to non-gal xenoantigens. the determination as to whether these igvh genes are induced during delayed rejection of gal knockout organs would provide insight as to whether xenoantibodies directed at structurally-similar carbohydrates may play a role in delayed rejection. the role of this group of antibodies and the contribution of the complex cdr <dig> topography to binding affinity and specificity are the subject of ongoing studies in our laboratory.
