BACKGROUND
observations of discordance between paleontological and molecular age estimates, or between ages estimated from different molecular datasets, are fairly common and have been observed in angiosperms  <cit> - <cit> , mammals  <cit> - <cit> , ray-finned fishes  <cit> - <cit> , and various other lineages across the tree of life  <cit> , <cit> . multiple factors are invoked to explain conflicting molecular age estimates, including modeling of paleontological calibrations  <cit> - <cit> , nucleotide substitution rate heterogeneity  <cit> , <cit> , and the appropriateness of the molecular clock model used  <cit> , <cit> . however, the impact of the phylogenetic informativeness of gene sequences on molecular divergence time estimates has received considerably less attention.

sequences whose sites have experienced large numbers of substitutions, either as a function of a rapid rate of molecular evolution or the passage of long periods of evolutionary time, will likely exhibit a high frequency of homoplasious character states. this homoplasy is problematic because a high frequency of convergent nucleotide states can bias branch length estimation in phylogenetic analyses, as the rate of hidden substitutions will often be under- or overestimated  <cit> - <cit> . however, distinguishing between homoplasy and other sources of discordance is challenging in empirical datasets. this is largely because commonly used metrics that address the influence of nucleotide saturation on phylogenetic branch length estimates, such as saturation plots  <cit> - <cit> , are often difficult to interpret in terms of where in a given clade’s history the branch length estimates or inferences of phylogenetic tree topology may be compromised  <cit> .

phylogenetic informativeness  methods offer a strategy to directly relate nucleotide saturation in data sets to molecular divergence time studies  <cit> . using the ratio of a rate of evolution to the optimal rate of evolution for phylogenetic inference at a particular time, pi profiles quantify informativeness. briefly, this approach takes an inferred vector of site-specific rates and generates a normalized, asymptotic likelihood density for a true synapomorphy occurring at a historical time t under a given model of character evolution. it should be noted that this is a predictive likelihood based entirely on the site-rates inferred, not an assessment of the validity of any empirical result. analysis of the full site-rate distribution provides a profile of phylogenetic informativeness that spans the entire temporal span of the focal phylogeny, illuminating the scope of phylogenetic signal attributable to the data through evolutionary time  <cit> . although phylogenetic informativeness profiles make no direct statement regarding the degree of saturation present in a dataset, the decline of the informativeness profile that follows the peak has been dubbed a “rain shadow of noise,” where the likely quantity of homoplasy influencing a node is comparable to the drop from the peak of the pi profile to its height aligned to the node  <cit> . this decline at depth from the peak of the pi profile should not only provide insights into where in the temporal span of the phylogeny to expect an increase in phylogenetic noise for topological inference, but also should provide a predictive tool for assessing the potential for data sets to provide strongly supported yet discordant age estimates.

determining whether estimated ages are the result of estimation biases, or substantial gaps in the fossil record, is especially critical in reconstructing the history of vertebrate diversification. many analyses of mitogenomic datasets sampled from lineages that span deep evolutionary time scales have resulted in age estimates that are far older than the expectations from the fossil record  <cit> , <cit> - <cit>  and the rapid rate of nucleotide substitution that characterizes the vertebrate mitochondrial genome has prompted multiple investigators to question whether molecular age estimates obtained using mitogenomic data are the result of such biases  <cit> , <cit> .

the discordance between molecular age estimates is striking within ray-finned fishes . while actinopterygians have a fossil record dating to the devonian  <cit> , limited paleobiological surveys of richness through time  <cit>  and striking disagreement between competing molecular age estimates have impeded our understanding of the timescale underlying their diversification. estimates made for actinopterygians on the basis of mitogenomic and nuclear datasets often indicate very different evolutionary timelines. for example, the origin of acanthomorphs , which include nearly one third of all living vertebrates  <cit> , is placed in the triassic  based on mitogenomic age estimates  <cit> , <cit> . this suggests that the majority of living fish diversity originated during a period of recovery following the permian-triassic mass extinction event , with major acanthomorph lineages beginning to radiate throughout the triassic and jurassic . by contrast, recent molecular clock analyses using ndna place the origin of acanthomorphs in the early cretaceous, followed by extensive diversification in the late cretaceous and early paleocene  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . a comparable timescale has also been estimated by some mitogenomic analyses  <cit> , and is more consistent with patterns in the fossil record  <cit> , <cit> - <cit>  than the early mesozoic acanthomorph radiation implied by other studies. as actinopterygians comprise half of all living backboned animals, including several model organisms and species of great economic importance, understanding the timing of their diversification provides critical insight into the evolutionary history of vertebrates.

disagreement between mtdna and ndna estimates is not directionally consistent, i.e., many mtdna estimates are older than ndna counterparts, but there are examples of the opposite pattern  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , and discordant timescales might also arise from other factors that differ between analyses: the selection and placement of calibrations, the clock models applied, and the taxa sampled. however, this study seeks to fix, as completely as possible, these other variables, and explore the impact that different sequence data have on estimation of evolutionary timescales. we evaluate phylogenetic informativeness  profiles  <cit>  for gene sequences sampled among major actinopterygian lineages and demonstrate that is not necessary to attribute divergent molecular age estimates to issues in modeling of paleontological data as calibration age priors as previsouly suggested  <cit> . instead, the divergent estimates can be attributed to levels of homoplasy in the mtdna and nuclear gene datasets that distort inferences at different time scales. by removing data partitions that are saturated, we reconcile divergent molecular age estimates for actinopterygians, bringing these more in line with ages implied by the fossil record. these results demonstrate that selection of sequence data appropriate for the time scale of inferences is as important as the selection of calibrations and molecular clock models for divergence time estimation.

RESULTS
information-theoretic based searches of partitioning strategies found  <dig> and  <dig> partitions as the best fit for the mtdna  and nuclear dna  datasets respectively. molecular age estimates between sets of analyses with differing calibration schemes were very similar  and substantially outside of the prior expectations . as manipulation of the calibration age priors to reflect potential uncertainties in the fossil record had a minimal influence on trends in the resulting molecular age estimates, we restrict discussion to the most calibration-rich analysis here. regardless of calibration strategy, molecular dating analyses of the mtdna and ndna datasets including all data partitions resulted in very different posterior age estimates, with the mtdna posterior age estimates generally being much older and exclusive of the 95% highest posterior density interval  for many ndna estimates . estimated ages were most consistent towards the root of the tree, with higher uncertainty in the mtdna estimates. the hpd of the estimated age from the mtdna analysis for the most recent common ancestor  of actinopterygians ranged between  <dig> and 416 ma  similar to the hpd of ages for this node in the ndna analysis, which ranged between  <dig> and 399 ma . in contrast, instances of discordance between the mtdna and ndna age estimates were more extreme within acanthomorphs. for example, the hpd for the mrca of tetraodontidae and diodontidae  ranged between  <dig> and 57 ma  in the ndna analyses, whereas the hpd ranged between  <dig> to 179 ma  in the mtdna analyses . similarly, the hpd for the mrca of fundulus and gambusia ranged between  <dig> and 160 ma  in the mtdna analyses, compared to an hpd between  <dig> and 46 ma in the ndna analyses .

the phylogenetic informativeness profile of several mtdna partitions peaked prior to the majority of nodes present in the tree , and the shapes of the pi profiles for each individual codon position were similar within partitions . higher profiles of pi indicate greater utility for phylogenetic inference. however, a decline of pi profile following the peak is indicative of a “rainshadow of noise”, reflecting an increased probability that numerous hidden substitutions have accumulated that can mislead phylogenetic inference  <cit> . while the informativeness profiles of the nuclear gene partitions also exhibited a signature of homoplasy  and conservation of pi profile shape within partitions , these declines were much less severe than those observed for the mtdna partitions . removal of nucleotide data partitions with pi profiles that exhibit greater than a five percent decay of informativeness from the pi profile peak prior to the cretaceous-jurassic boundary  from the subsequent relaxed molecular clock analyses removed  <dig> individual sites  and resulted in substantial changes to the posterior age estimates using mtdna . indeed, almost all estimated ages from the mtdna dataset after pruning of saturated data partitions shifted between  <dig> and  <dig> million years towards the present . in contrast, removal of the saturated ndna data partitions resulted in a removal of  <dig> individual sites  that had less effect on divergence time estimates . this global shift in node age estimates undermines support for a more ancient timescale of ray-finned fish evolution, instead reconciling the divergence time estimates generated by the two datasets. while analysis of the complete mtdna dataset estimated the bulk of extant ray-finned fish lineages to have originated in the jurassic , analysis of datasets pruned of saturated partitions shifted the majority of these estimates into the cretaceous , and paleogene . for example the hpd estimated from the pruned mtdna analysis for the mrca of acanthomorphs shifted to a range between  <dig> and 179 ma . this result is congruent with the hpd of 108–135 ma based on ndna , but substantially deviates from the hpd of 223–254 ma estimated using the full mtdna dataset . this shift in estimated ages was also observed in younger clades. for instance, the hpd of 34–89 ma , estimated from the pruned mtdna analysis for the mrca of sticklebacks and eelpouts undermines the credibility for the original estimated hpd of 109–149 ma  obtained from the full mtdna dataset. instead this result now largely overlaps with the ndna-based age hpd of 33–58 ma .

discussion
the timescale of ray-finned fish evolution
discordance between the older mtdna age estimates and the more recent ndna based estimates have been attributed to a lack of shared calibrations between mtdna and ndna based studies  <cit> . however, despite using identical calibrations between datasets, our mtdna based estimates still support an origin of most major lineages in the jurassic . these results are similar to some previous mtdna based studies  <cit> , and are in direct opposition with patterns of fossil richness that depict a radiation of living actinopterygian, particularly species-rich acanthomorph, lineages in the cretaceous  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . these ages are also at odds with our ndna based age estimates, which more closely match paleontological expectations within acanthomorphs . we therefore find little support that calibration choice is the primary driver of discordant age estimates between these datasets.

instead, pi profiles show that for deep divergences more than half of the identified mtdna protein-coding gene partitions predict potentially misleading saturation . saturation of mitogenomic data has been suggested to bias topological inferences in ray-finned fishes  <cit> . removal of partitions exhibiting predicted saturation resulted in a topological rearrangement that greatly diminished support for relationships that differed from the ndna based topology globally. even when taking uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships into account, removal of saturated partitions resulted in a consistent shift in age estimates by as much as  <dig> my towards the present for almost all nodes in the tree , with 95% hpd intervals overlapping between ndna and mtdna based estimates . in contrast, removal of noisy partitions from the ndna analysis had a neglible affect on the resulting divergence times, as would be predicted by the shallow decline in the pi profiles .

this reconciliation of the ray-finned fish evolutionary timeline contributes to a strengthened historical framework that promises new insights into the evolutionary processes that generate and maintain aquatic biodiversity. our finding suggests that at least some of the discordance surrounding actinopterygian divergence time estimates  <cit> - <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit>  can be explained by branch length estimation biases. however, this finding should not be viewed as a problem restricted to mtdna or as a general phenomenon in which saturation always results in older age estimates. the latter is certainly not true, as phillips  <cit>  demonstrated that depending on the calibration placement and the character state patterns of saturated sites, nucleotide saturation can result in either tree extension or compression.

deep time mitogenomic studies of fishes also do not always conflict with ndna based studies. for example, in a mitogenomic study by miya et al.  <cit> , a large range of sampled acanthomorph lineages have divergence time estimates that overlap between ndna based  <cit> - <cit>  and reject previous mtdna based analyses  <cit> . this reversal of conflict is partially explained for two reasons. first, our informativeness profiles show partitions of the fish mitochondrial genome to be more informative at recent timescales , and miya et al.  <cit>  limited their taxon sampling to only 30% of the timescale sampled by miya et al.  <cit> . second, this study excluded the gene nd <dig>  from which we also exclude two thirds of codon positions in this study , and recoded transitional changes  to a single state in an effort to exclude saturated sites  <cit> . although miya et al.  <cit>  also attempted to mitigate the influence of saturation by excluding third codon positions, our results highlight rates of molecular evolution do not always conform to codon positions and that informativeness for some first and second positions also declines over deep timescales .

our reconciliation of the timeline of ray-finned fish diversification adds support for the growing consensus that the patterns of species richness observed in living fishes are largely the product of diversification during the late mesozoic and cenozoic  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . much of the diversity of living fishes can be attributed to the success of acanthomorphs, which comprise roughly one in every three vertebrate species. understanding the timeline underlying this group is therefore not only critical to investigations of the evolution of fish biodiversity, but also to investigations of vertebrate evolution in general. although there is still conflict between divergence times estimated for acanthomorph clades such as tetraodontiforms  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> , cichlids  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , and notothenioids  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , uncertainties surrounding competing mean age estimates typically show broad overlap between the majority of studies. this is encouraging and suggests convergence on a robust temporal framework from which to unlock the mode and tempo of diversification in this spectacular group of vertebrates.

profiling phylogenetic informativeness
recognition that convergence in nucleotide character states, or saturation, diminishes the utility of gene sequences for phylogenetic inference at deeper evolutionary time scales is not new  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> , and multiple approaches exist to assess when homoplasy has or will critically influence phylogenetic inferences. these include saturation plots  <cit> , <cit> , ry coding variable characters  <cit> , <cit> , down weighting characters  <cit> , <cit> , and site removal  <cit> , <cit> . however, the development of a predictive framework that facilitates careful scrutiny of the power of diverse datasets to resolve phylogenetic problems has only recently begun  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . our finding that pi profiles predict the temporal optimality of markers for providing branch length estimates identifies a useful heuristic framework for assessing the credibility of existing age estimates.

while discordance in molecular age estimates is frequently attributed to factors such as differential application of fossil-based age constraints  <cit> - <cit> , suitable modeling of paleontological calibration data  <cit> - <cit> , nucleotide substitution rate heterogeneity  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , or differences between molecular clock models  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> , our results demonstrate that the choice of molecular markers can also drive discordance when identical analysis conditions are employed. although our study focuses on largely on mitochondrial genes because these have been found to have a nucleotide substitution rate much higher than nuclear exons commonly used in phylogenetic studies of many vertebrate clades  <cit> - <cit> , this is not a universal pattern across the tree of life  <cit> - <cit> . nucleotide saturation is a feature often observed in next-generation phylogenomic datasets  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> .

by utilizing phylogenetic informativeness approaches to identify data partitions characterized by saturation and homoplasy, much of the discordance between mtdna and ndna datasets is reconciled . it should be noted that this reconciliation does not always guarantee a one-to-one mapping of divergence time estimates between analyses nor does it predict how changes in the analytical conditions will influence posterior age estimates. for example, our exclusion of a prior age calibration for the mrca of african and new world cichlids or stem tetraodontiformes resulted in a shift to slightly older ages when using the pruned mtdna dataset while not having a pronounced affect on the distribution of the global node ages inferred in ndna based analyses . however, in this case differences between age estimates were minor, with the removal of saturated data partitions having a far greater impact on resulting age estimates.

phylogenetic informativeness approaches facilitate a diagnosis of when to expect a rise in homoplasious site patterns, offering an objective criterion for screening data by its utility for molecular divergence time estimation. as phylogenetic datasets become “phylogenomic” in scale  <cit> , development of these approaches becomes essential for the selection of loci that will not be misleading from potentially hundreds of markers  <cit> . our results demonstrate that for age-estimation just as for phylogenetic inference  <cit> , more data alone is not enough. while adding more data can provide novel insights into the evolutionary patterns that underlie the tree of life  <cit> , more data alone does not render an analysis immune from methodological artifacts such as homoplasy  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . as divergence time estimates rely on calibrated substitution rate estimates our results underscore that it is necessary to diagnose the effects of saturation and homoplasy at different time scales, even as hundreds, if not thousands, of loci become applied to dating the genomic tree of life.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that even with identical calibration regimes and molecular clock methods, the influence of homoplasy has a pronounced affect on divergence time estimates. we also demonstrate the utility of pi profiles for providing a much-needed non-arbitrary criterion for data exclusion. by extending the utility of pi profiles to this task, we highlight the ability of these methods to assess the robustness of age estimates relative to the frequency of homoplasious character states in the data. applying this approach to the timescale of ray-finned fish evolution, we reconcile two fundamentally different views on the timescale of aquatic vertebrate diversification by removing partitions deemed saturated. the results obtained by pruning the saturated positions in this manner are more in line with paleontological expectations, suggesting that most major lineages of extant fishes today are cretaceous in origin rather than emerging subsequent to the permian-triassic mass extinction event or the remnants of an ancient jurassic radiation. our results suggest that in addition to care in the selection of calibrations and molecular clock models, careful scrutiny of the potentially misleading impact of homoplasious data to be a fundamental component of divergence time estimation.
