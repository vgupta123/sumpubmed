BACKGROUND
g proteins constitute a large superfamily of regulatory proteins that show a high similarity in primary structure and organization of the functional center  <cit> . they all share a common gtpase cycle, being turned on by binding gtp and off by hydrolyzing gtp to gdp. additional regulatory proteins are often required to induce the conformational changes that occur during this cycle: guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which catalyze release of bound gdp and promote its replacement by gtp, and gtpase-activating proteins, which accelerate gtp hydrolysis. such transition between active and inactive forms allows for them to serve as molecular switches and to make g proteins suitable for the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes such as signal transduction, cytoskeletal reorganizations, vesicular transport and protein synthesis  <cit> . the superfamily of g proteins includes three main classes: ras-like gtpases, gα subunits of heterotrimeric g proteins, and the translation elongation factors.

the eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig> alpha, currently termed eef1a, is a member of the g protein family, and one of the four subunits that compose the eukaryotic elongation factor  <dig>  <cit> . it is the second-most abundant protein after actin, comprising 1–3% of the total protein content in normal growing cells  <cit> . in its gtp-liganded form, eef1a catalyzes the first step of the elongation cycle during peptide synthesis, interacting with aminoacyl-trna to bring it to the acceptor site of the ribosome  <cit> . following hydrolysis of the gtp, the complex eef1a·gdp is released from the ribosome and further converted to the active gtp-bound form by elongation factor  <dig> beta, which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eef1a. apart from its key role in protein translation, other functions have been reported as well. eef1a has been characterized as an actin binding protein with the ability to bundle f actin  <cit>  displaying microtubule severing  <cit>  and stabilizing  <cit>  activities, although the biological significance of these interactions is still unclear. in addition, eef1a is thought to play a role in mediating signal transduction, as it has been shown to interact with plcγ  <cit> , and to be an activator of phosphoinositol 4-kinase  <cit> , an enzyme belonging to the signal transduction cascade activated by growth factors. furthermore, an altered expression of eef1a has been found in several kinds of tumors  <cit> . it has been also demonstrated that eef1a is required for the degradation of nα-acetylated proteins probably acting as a ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase, thus rendering the substrate more easily degraded by the proteasome or by reducing the correct folding of the protein/ubiquitins complex for the subsequent proteolytic degradation  <cit> . finally, upregulation of eef1a mediated either by p <dig>  <cit>  or in response to oxidative stress  <cit>  seems to be involved in apoptosis. it is likely that this broad diversity of functions may explain why eef1a is such a well-conserved protein in eukaryotic organisms.

eukaryotes possess a variable number of eef1a genes. in plants from  <dig> to  <dig> eef1a genes have been described in maize  <cit> , and nine in cotton  <cit> . in fungi, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two eef1a genes  <cit> , and mucor racemosus has three  <cit> . in animals, the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster contains two genes, one of which is found to be expressed only in certain stages of development  <cit> . three eef1a genes in xenopus laevis are expressed at different developmental stages: the oocyte form , present in male and female germ cells, the somatic form , hardly detectable in oocytes but present in embryos and adult cells, and the 42sp <dig> form, detected only in oocytes  <cit> . in the mammalian genome many eef1a-like loci exist, most of which appear to be pseudogenes  <cit> . in fact, only two of these sequences are currently known to be actively expressed in human  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , and rabbit  <cit> . the two eef1a protein isoforms encoded by these genes are currently termed eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig>  and display a quite different expression pattern in tissues. whereas eef1a <dig> is expressed in all tissues, eef1a <dig> is only present in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, which are tissues composed of cells locked in a state of nonproliferation  <cit> . in teleosts, only one actively transcribed eef1a gene has been reported in danio rerio  <cit> , sparus aurata  <cit> , oreochromis niloticus  <cit> , and oryzias latipes  <cit> . in flatfish, partial sequences of one expressed eef1a gene have been described in scophthalmus maximus  <cit> , paralichthys olivaceus  <cit> , and paralichthys lethostigma  <cit> .

senegalese sole, solea senegalensis , is a commercially important flatfish. this species undergoes metamorphosis from  <dig> to  <dig> days post hatch  during larval development. the process involves jaw and head restructuring, eye migration from the left to the right side, and a change from a symmetrical to an asymmetrical body shape  <cit> . these drastic morphological changes have been shown to be regulated by thyroid hormones  in flatfish  <cit> . nevertheless, few data are available about the biological role of eef1a in flatfish metamorphosis. in fact, only in scophthalmus maximus this question has been somehow addressed. in this species, coincident t <dig> and eef1a expression peaks are detected at the climax of metamorphosis  <cit> . nevertheless, the gene expression pattern of senegalese sole eef1a during larval development and in tissues, and its dependence on ths, remains to be elucidated.

large-scale genomics of senegalese sole has allowed for the availability of a high number of est sequences. in this study, we have identified and characterized five different eef1a genes, referred to as sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  and sse42sp <dig>  the main sequence features are described hereinafter. a phylogenetic analysis was carried out to identify putative ortholog sequences. gene expression profiles during larval development and in tissues from juvenile soles were explored using real-time pcr. additionally, thiourea  and t <dig> treatments were carried out in order to reveal the possible dependence of all sseef1a expressions on ths.

RESULTS
molecular characterization of senegalese sole eef1a genes
five senegalese sole eef1a genes, referred to as sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  and sse42sp <dig>  were identified after est analysis of a normalized cdna library constructed from different larval stages , undifferentiated gonads, and six adult tissues . a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clones were identified as sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig> and sse42sp <dig>  respectively . sequencing of specific pcr products amplified from a pre-metamorphic library using senegalese sole eef1a-specific and the universal t <dig> and t <dig> primers confirmed sequences for all sseef1a loci.

main features of the cdnas are summarized in table  <dig>  the cdna lengths ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  nucleotides  for sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig>  respectively. all of them contained a short 5'-untranslated region  followed by an open reading frame of  <dig>  nt ,  <dig>  nt , and  <dig>  nt . the 3'-untranslated region varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  nt long and included one  or two  canonical polyadenylation signals , and a short oligo-a tail. the nucleotide sequences surrounding the atg initiator codon fit well to the consensus sequence of kozak  <cit> , including a  or g  at position - <dig> and g at position + <dig> . the predicted molecular weights and  isoelectric points of the translated amino acid sequences of senegalese sole  eef1a genes ranged between  <dig> - <dig>  kda and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively.

all sseef1as possessed the characteristic regions g <dig> to g <dig> critical in gdp/gtp exchange, gtp-induced conformational change and gtp hydrolysis   <cit> . the three consensus elements gxxxxgk , dxxg  and nkxd   <cit>  were identified in the gtp-binding domain of the senegalese sole polypeptides. in addition, the predicted amino acid sequences were scanned against the prosite database of sequence motifs. the conserved motif dklkaerergitidi was identified at positions  <dig> to  <dig> in each of sseef1as as the gtp-binding elongation factor signature .

sseef1a genes shared high sequence homology at nucleotide level in the coding region  and at amino acid level . a multiple alignment was performed with the dna  and amino acid sequences  of eef1a from other vertebrates . as observed for senegalese sole sequences, the identities obtained in all the pairwise comparisons were lower at dna than at amino acid level, indicating that the highest sequence variation was at the third codon positions. identities of sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> amino acid sequences were higher than those determined for sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> with regard to eef1a from the other species. by the other side, 42sp <dig> sequences exhibited high identities, with values above 87% in the comparisons performed.

the phylogenetic relationships of the five sseef1as as well as the predicted protein sequence of other vertebrate eef1a genes were determined using the maximum likelihood  and neighbor-joining  methods. the prottest analysis  <cit>  determined the jtt + g model as being the bestfit model of amino acid sequence evolution  with a gamma shape value  of  <dig> . these settings were also employed for the nj analysis. the topology of the trees obtained with these parameters are depicted in figure  <dig>  and figure  <dig> , with drosophila melanogaster  eef1a proteins used as outgroups. complex evolutionary relatedness was obtained. sseef1a <dig> was linked together with other teleost eef1as in a consistent clade . sseef1a <dig> was clustered in a highly supported branch  with turbot eef1a as well as with two other teleost sequences from oryzias latipes and gasterosteus aculeatus. in addition, all 42sp <dig> proteins were grouped together in a highly consistent ramification . interestingly, both sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> appeared in a more basal position of both trees, and no consistent clustering with any of the sequences added was observed.

expression levels of sseef1a genes in tissues
steady-state levels of the five sseef1a transcripts were quantitated in liver, spleen, intestine, stomach, head-kidney, gills, skeletal muscle, brain, heart, and skin from juvenile soles . relative gene expression levels were normalized by measuring ubiquitin gene and expressed relative to liver. all sseef1a genes were found in detectable amounts in the tissues examined. sseef1a <dig> transcripts were quite similar in all tissues examined except in muscle . sseef1a <dig> reached the highest expression levels in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain . sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> showed very similar expression patterns, as they were strongly expressed in gills  and skin . finally, sse42sp <dig> was expressed at a relatively high level in brain .

although they exhibited differential expression profiles, we calculated the relative amount of the five sseef1a mrna levels in the  <dig> tissues examined . as a whole, sseef1a <dig> transcripts were the most abundant with  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> -fold higher overall mean expression ratios than sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  and sse42sp <dig>  respectively. nevertheless, sseef1a <dig> showed the highest values in muscle , and it was only  <dig> and 3-fold lower expressed than sseef1a <dig> in brain and heart, respectively. sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> reached relatively important expression levels in gills  and skin . finally, sse42sp <dig> was expressed at very low amounts in all tissues.

expression levels and regulation during larval development
expression patterns of sseef1a genes during larval development  were also determined. data were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase   <cit> , and further expressed relative to  <dig> dph. all transcripts were detected very early at  <dig> dph . nevertheless, they displayed different expression profiles during development. sseef1a <dig> transcripts remained relatively constant with no significant changes between pre-metamorphosis and metamorphosis. a similar expression pattern was observed for sseef1a <dig>  although a significant peak in mrna levels was observed at first feeding . the expression profile of sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> was quite similar. both transcripts were constant until  <dig> dph, when they increased significantly , and thereafter they rose progressively until the end of metamorphosis. in relation to sse42sp <dig>  the highest expression levels were detected at first developmental stages with no significant changes from  <dig> to  <dig> dph. as observed in tissues, sseef1a <dig> was the most abundantly expressed of all genes during larval development .

to study the involvement of ths on the expression of sseef1a genes,  <dig> dph larvae were exposed to the goitrogen tu. as a consequence of the tu treatment, the metamorphic process was blocked at s1-s <dig> stages as determined by the degree of eye migration. no differences in survivability were observed with respect to the untreated control . mrna levels for sseef1a genes were quantified in whole larvae pools collected at  <dig> hours, and  <dig> days,  <dig> days, and  <dig> days after treatment . untreated control larvae exhibited expression profiles similar to those described above in all cases . no significant differences in gene expression were observed for sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig> and sse42sp <dig> between untreated control and tu-treated larvae. however, tu-treated larvae showed  <dig> and 4-fold lower  sseef1a <dig> mrna levels than untreated controls at both  <dig> and  <dig> dat, respectively.

at the sight of these results, we carried out a rescue assay to determine the ability of t <dig> to revert the tu effect on the expression of sseef1a <dig>  for this purpose,  <dig> dph larvae were exposed to tu to ensure the lack of endogenously synthesized t <dig> at day  <dig>  when the exogenous t <dig>  was supplied. mrna levels of sseef1a <dig> gene were determined in larvae sampled at  <dig> and  <dig> days after t <dig> treatment . the metamorphosis blocking induced by tu was not observed in tu+t <dig> treated larvae. the expression patterns of untreated and tu-treated larvae were similar to those described above . interestingly, tu+t <dig> treated larvae exhibited significantly higher sseef1a <dig> transcript levels than untreated  and tu-treated  larvae both at  <dig> and  <dig> datt, respectively .

discussion
three rounds of large-scale gene duplications, referred to as 1r, 2r, and 3r or fish-specific genome duplication, have been proposed to take place in the fish evolutionary lineage  <cit> . as a result, several gene copies have been described in teleosts for some group of genes including glycolytic enzymes  <cit> , hox genes  <cit> , hormones and their receptors  <cit> , and keratins  <cit> . the majority of gene duplicates have been lost or silenced during evolution but in some instances paralogue genes have picked up new functions , or divided the ancestral function between paralogs   <cit> . such a selective advantage would have avoided loss of functionally active duplicates. in this study, we have obtained the complete cdna sequence of five distinct senegalese sole eef1a genes, referred to as sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  and sse42sp <dig>  all of them share high identity at both  nucleotide  and amino acid  levels. amino acid sequence analysis of the predicted polypeptides revealed the presence of the consensus amino acid sequence that identifies a gtp-binding protein  <cit>  in all of them with spacing between the characteristic sequence elements gxxxxgk , dxxg  and nkxd  that fell into the expected size . furthermore, the five senegalese sole proteins possessed the characteristic motif that provides a signature for gtp-binding elongation factor. altogether, these results indicate that sseef1a genes actually encode for functional eef1a proteins.

phylogenetic analyses were carried out using a wide range of vertebrate eef1a predicted proteins. a number of sequences found in the complete genome of several teleosts and mammals belonging to eef1a family were also included, although it is not known if such sequences are actively transcribed or represent pseudogenes. phylogeny gives strong support to the classification of sseef1a <dig> as the senegalese sole ortholog of teleost eef1a. furthermore, we can consider that teleost eef1a, including sseef1a <dig>  is the fish counterpart of tetrapod eef1a <dig>  such a conclusion is based on two main observations. firstly, the high sequence identities of teleost with tetrapod eef1a proteins as obtained with the sequences employed in this study, ranging between  <dig> – <dig> % . and secondly, gene expression analyses indicate that teleost eef1a  <cit>  as well as sseef1a is a highly abundant mrna transcript that exhibits a relatively uniform distribution across many tissues, as observed in mammalian eef1a <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, strikingly enough, turbot smaef1a as well as the predicted polypeptides of one o. latipes and g. aculeatus sequences appeared closely linked to sseef1a <dig> in a different clade to teleost eef1a, being even more closely related to mammalian  eef1a isoforms. according to the expression pattern in tissues of sseef1a <dig>  we suggest that this fish paralog represents the counterpart to mammalian eef1a <dig>  in this sense, northern blot and immunoblotting analyses have revealed that expression of mammalian eef1a <dig> is limited to the terminally differentiated cells of the skeletal muscle, brain, and heart  <cit> , the same tissues where sseef1a <dig> reached the highest expression levels. if this gene is only expressed in the species analyzed here or in a wide range of flatfish or teleosts is a problem that needs to be resolved in future studies. in any case, the presence of these two genes in fish and mammals suggests that such gene duplication was an early evolutionary event. an interesting issue is that, in contrast to teleost, a close phylogenetic relatedness between mammalian eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig> isoforms was observed. one possible explanation for this important difference is the increased evolutionary rate that is known to occur in fish genes  <cit>  making sequence divergence between mammalian and fish counterparts comparable to a pair of fish paralogous genes.

the biological roles of mammalian eef1a isoforms have been widely studied  <cit> . at present, it is unclear why there are two isoforms of eef1a. in vitro, the translational elongation activity is similar but there is a difference in the off-rate for gdp as eef1a <dig> binds gdp more strongly than gtp, whereas the opposite is true for eef1a <dig>  <cit> . given that eef1a <dig> is expressed specifically in cells that have permanently withdrawn from the cell cycle such as neurons, cardiomyocites and myocites  <cit> , it has been suggested that eef1a <dig> may be involved in pathways of protein synthesis specifically for nonproliferating cells or in the non-translational roles suggested for eef1a. it seems that eef1a <dig> is anti-apoptotic  <cit> , which is closely related with its possible role in tumourigenesis  <cit> . if we consider the high degree of structural and functional relatedness existing between eef1a from different organisms, it is highly probable that fish orthologous genes carry out the same functions as mammalian isoforms.

all 42sp <dig> proteins grouped together in a highly consistent cluster both in ml and nj trees. although orthologous genes have been described in other teleosts, we could no identify a mammalian counterpart in any of the complete genomes available in databases. thus, it seems that this gene was lost early in the evolution of tetrapods. little information is found concerning its possible function. in x. laevis, 42sp <dig> transcripts have only been detected in oocytes, and the protein interacts with other components of the 42s rnp particle, which serves as storage of 5s rrna and various trnas  <cit> . senegalese sole sse42sp <dig> was expressed in all tissues examined, but at a highly significant lesser amount than sseef1a <dig>  phylogeny of sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> is more difficult to interpret because it was poorly resolved, mainly due to the fact that no teleost  sequence significantly clustered with them. furthermore, we have failed to identify possible counterparts in the complete genome of other teleosts and mammals available in databases. nevertheless, we argue that both sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> are probably the result of recent gene duplications. both genes expressed mainly in gills and skin, two tissues involved in respiratory and osmoregulatory processes  <cit> . it is tempting to assume that they could be involved in the translational regulation of factors playing a role in such important biological activities in the senegalese sole. and in the case of sseef1a <dig>  an additional role in metamorphosis will be discussed below.

metamorphosis in flatfish is characterized by the change from a symmetrical, pelagic larva to an asymmetric, benthic juvenile, and by the eye migration from one side of the head to the other. ths have shown to play a key role in flatfish metamorphosis. important physiological and molecular switches in erythropoiesis, myosin light chains, troponin t, and gill mitochondria-rich cells as well as differentiation of gastric glands and epidermal adult cells, and re-organization of the neural retina skin have been reported to occur during this dramatic process in a ths dependent manner  <cit> . more recently, it has also been reported that ths down-regulate gapdh <dig> transcripts after metamorphosis climax  <cit>  demonstrating the dependence of the glycolytic pathway on ths. with regard to eef1a an expression peak at the climax of metamorphosis, coincident with a t <dig> peak, has been detected in turbot  <cit> . interestingly, regulation by ths of the germ cell specific ef-1αo gene has been demonstrated during metamorphosis in x. laevis  <cit> . the start of metamorphosis has been associated to a surge of ths that increase their levels until the metamorphic climax, and reduce towards post-climax  <cit> . in this study, the possible regulation of sseef1a genes by ths was analyzed using tu and combined tu+t <dig> treatments. tu is a blocking agent of ths synthesis that can reduce t <dig> levels by about 95%  <cit> . exogenous treatments with tu as well as other types of thyroid inhibitors have proved useful to study the involvement of ths on metamorphosis in flatfish  <cit>  and the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the pituitary-thyroid axis  <cit> . tu-treated larvae exhibited significantly lower sseef1a <dig> transcripts levels than untreated larvae at late metamorphosis, whereas mrna levels of the other four genes remained relatively unchanged. in contrast, addition of t <dig> increased the amount of sseef1a <dig> transcripts to significantly higher levels than those detected in untreated and tu-treated larvae. these results demonstrate that ths up-regulate either directly or indirectly sseef1a <dig> expression, and constitute the first report of the dependence on ths of an elongation factor gene during flatfish metamorphosis. although further research will be required to elucidate the precise role of sseef1a <dig> in the drastic changes that occur during metamorphosis, it can be hypothesized that sseef1a <dig> is involved in the translational regulation of the factors that promote an appropriate transition from larval to juvenile stage in response to ths. in fact, elongation factors are directly involved in the regulation of peptide synthesis  <cit> . yet, other non-translational functions during metamorphosis cannot be ruled out.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, in this work we describe the sequence and main features of five eef1a genes in the senegalese sole, referred to as sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  sseef1a <dig>  and sse42sp <dig>  combined phylogenetic and tissue expression analyses revealed sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> as the putative counterparts of mammalian eef1a <dig> and eef1a <dig>  respectively, and sse42sp <dig> as the ortholog of x. laevis and teleost 42sp <dig>  in contrast, sseef1a <dig> and sseef1a <dig> represent novel genes, as orthologous genes have not been identified neither in fish nor mammals. the five genes exhibited different expression patterns during larval development. tu and t <dig> treatments demonstrated that sseef1a <dig> was up-regulated by ths, suggesting a role in the translational regulation of the factors involved in the dramatic changes that occur during senegalese sole metamorphosis. the regulation and interaction of senegalese sole elongation factors with other genes are questions that need to be clarified in the future and will help to improve the aquaculture conditions for this species. wih regard to this, present work constitutes undoubtly a useful framework for further studies.
