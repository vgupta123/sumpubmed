BACKGROUND
the oomycete phytophthora infestans, the cause of potato  late blight disease, is one of the most confounding plant pathogens. despite over a century of resistance breeding, fungicide use, and other control measures, it is still a major threat to sustainable food production worldwide. p. infestans is responsible for global annual costs of at least € <dig>  billion in control measures and crop losses and is especially a threat to farmers’ income and food security in developing countries  <cit> . in addition, new regulations designed to reduce threats to the environment will limit the availability of fungicides, and conditions favoring overwintering spores due to the effects of global warming, are expected to increase problems with this disease  <cit> .

p. infestans has a hemibiotrophic life cycle  <cit>  and bi-phasic growth, with an initial biotrophic phase and subsequent necrotrophic phase of infection  <cit> . the successful suppression of plant defense by effector molecules leads to a compatible interaction between plant and pathogen, which is referred to as effector-triggered susceptibility   <cit> . a large number of extracellular and cytoplasmic effectors in the p. infestans genome have been identified  <cit>  and increasing evidence for their role in establishing ets exists. however, knowledge about their targets in the plant host is scarce, mainly because of the limited availability of hemibiotrophic pathogens with susceptible interactions with the model species arabidopsis
 <cit> . some of the p. infestans extracellular effectors are inhibitors that target defense-related proteins such as proteases and glucanases, and processes such as programmed cell death in plants. for example, kazal-like extracellular serine protease inhibitors epi <dig> and epi <dig> inhibit the p69b subtilisin-like serine protease in tomato  <cit> , while others such as the cystatin-like protein target cysteine-proteases  <cit>  and epic <dig> and epic2b inhibit papain-like cysteine protease rcr <dig>  in the same plant  <cit> . these latter two inhibitors also target cysteine protease c <dig> by direct binding in the extracellular compartment  <cit> . in addition to extracellular inhibition of c <dig> by epic <dig> and epic <dig>  an intracellular rxlr effector, avrblb <dig>  can prevent c <dig> secretion to the apoplast  <cit> . on the other hand, p. infestans has several xyloglucan-specific endoglucanases while the potato genome includes ten clustered genes for xyloglucans-specific endoglucanase inhibitor proteins   <cit> .

apart from pamp  recognition, plants have evolved a second mechanism of pathogen recognition through resistance genes, via direct or indirect interaction with effectors. through this mechanism plants can avoid ets, leading instead to an incompatible interaction between plant and pathogen, referred to as effector-triggered immunity . this is often accompanied by a hypersensitive response   <cit> . pamp and effector recognition leads to induction of biotic stress signaling involving map kinase cascades and induction of defense-related genes through phosphorylation of wrky  <cit>  and myb transcription factors  <cit> . wrky <dig> is involved in plant basal defense in tobacco, and is phosphorylated by mapks  <cit> . in addition, both jasmonic acid and salicylic acid are required for activation of pamp-induced defense responses in potato  <cit> .

genome-wide transcript profiling has revealed many similarities between incompatible and compatible interactions, but higher numbers of differentially expressed genes were found during an incompatible hyaloperonospora–arabidopsis interaction  <cit> . however, genes with altered expression exclusively in compatible interactions have also been identified . microarrays based on cdna clones , and more recently deepsage transcriptome sequencing analysis,  <cit>  have developed an understanding of compatible and incompatible interactions between p. infestans and potato, but none of these studies were based on the sequenced potato genome.

here, we present a genome-wide expression profiling of compatible and incompatible potato–p. infestans interactions in combination with quantitative apoplastic secretome analyses. although apoplastic profiling to find representative protein families has been performed in rice, chickpea, alfalfa and arabidopsis unaffected by plant pathogens  <cit> , and in response to pathogens to a limited extent  <cit> , quantitative analysis of apoplast proteins during the progress of any compatible and incompatible interactions has not been presented previously. the recent release of the potato genome  <cit> , combined with clone-specific sequence information determined by rna-seq, increased sensitivity of current mass spectrometers, and new methods for label-free quantitative proteomic analysis enabled our study. these technological advances present new possibilities to help understand mechanisms in plant-pathogen interactions as well as to identify candidates for resistance against pathogens.

the nordic countries have high p. infestans diversity, with both of the p. infestans mating types required for sexual reproduction and a suitable environment for sexual recombination  <cit> . since these conditions provide an excellent environment to evaluate sustainable resistance against p. infestans, we have chosen the two most resistant clones based on several years of field trials in sweden  <cit> . in addition, we monitor one compatible interaction, allowing us to find putative effector targets, many of which are single proteins from large gene families.

RESULTS
overview of differentially expressed genes and changes in protein abundance
in order to study stress responses in plant–oomycete interactions, we performed time series analyses of two incompatible interactions  and one compatible interaction  with p. infestans . this was performed at a global level using genome-wide microarrays to determine gene expression changes and short 1d-gel separation followed by ms/ms analysis on a lc-coupled orbitrap mass spectrometer to determine quantitative changes in apoplastic protein levels. sarpo mira and sw93- <dig> have similar hr initiation, but later sarpo mira has a more typical r gene-mediated expansion in hr lesions  <cit> . for the compatible interaction, desiree was chosen because it is the most used potato cultivar in molecular and physiological studies.

in our genome-wide array,  <dig> transcripts were significantly differentially expressed relative to uninoculated control in at least one time point in one or more clones during the course of p. infestans challenge . this demonstrates that this biotic stress condition has a profound effect on transcriptional responses in potato.table  <dig>

in order to improve the peptide identification by mass spectrometry, we generated about  <dig> million clean pair-end reads from rna-seq data for each of the three potato clones. contigs were constructed by de novo transcriptome assembly and subsequently ab initio gene prediction algorithms were used to predict orfs, which were then combined in a customized database for peptide identification. we found more than  <dig> transcripts  for each potato clone that lacked blast hits in the s. tuberosum predicted proteome  and an overall 17% increase in peptide identification was observed. from the apoplast of the three potato clones a total of  <dig> peptides were identified. peptides that appeared in at least two replicates per time point were kept, resulting in  <dig> peptides corresponding to  <dig> proteins, which were used for quantitative analysis. of the  <dig> identified proteins,  <dig> were found to be differentially abundant in at least one time point during the infection, and of these  <dig> had potato genome sequencing consortium  annotations. in total,  <dig> of the identified proteins could be classified into  <dig> different protein families by interproscan analysis  <cit> . based on targetp  <cit>  analysis for secretory signals,  <dig> of these proteins were predicted to have a secretory signal, which is in line with other apoplastic secretome studies  <cit> . among the most prominent protein families were subtilase family proteins, peroxidases, protease inhibitors, gdsl-lipases, and pectin esterases . several proteins that are classified as pathogenesis-related  proteins were identified both in infected and un-infected samples in all three potato clones, including thaumatin, glucanases, glucosidases, p <dig> proteins, peroxidases, serine proteases, cysteine proteases, prp <dig> protein, subtilases, chitinases, osmotins and lipid transfer proteins. many pr protein family members are thus present in the apoplast already prior to infection and could be putative effector targets very early in plant–pathogen interactions.figure  <dig>

at 6 hours post infection  and  <dig> hpi, similar total peptide intensity was observed in both compatible and incompatible interactions, suggesting similar amounts of protein at these time points. however, at  <dig> hpi we observed significantly higher total peptide intensity in the compatible interaction  compared with the two resistant potato clones  although fewer proteins with higher abundance were observed in desiree . at  <dig> hpi in desiree, glucanases and glucosidases comprised a major part of the total apoplast protein intensity, whereas total peptide intensity for all identified proteases and peptidases increased in all three clones . this indicates a more complex response of the protein composition in the incompatible interactions. for proteins that showed a change in abundance in the apoplast during infection only  <dig>  or 50%, of the corresponding transcripts showed differential expression .

a large number of transcripts were found to be differentially expressed at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi in both compatible and incompatible interactions . different sets of transcripts were differentially expressed between earlier time points  and later time point  , indicating a biphasic response to pathogen inoculation in both incompatible and compatible interactions.figure  <dig>

similar numbers of induced transcripts were observed in all three clones at 6 hpi . however in sarpo mira fewer differentially expressed transcripts were observed compared with the other two potato clones at later time-points . uninfected sw93- <dig> had around  <dig> transcripts that were differentially expressed compared to un-infected desiree controls. these included sa induced defense marker pr <dig> gene family members , and ja induced defense marker  <cit> 
myc <dig> . this supports our earlier conclusion that this clone has a paranoia trait, a weak constitutively active defense  <cit> . furthermore, go terms related to plant cell death and defense such as programmed cell death, methyl salicylate esterase activity, apoptotic process, and innate immune response were enriched in sw93- <dig> control samples compared to desiree control . sw93- <dig> generally had more differentially expressed transcripts than sarpo mira at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi , most of which were specific to sw93- <dig> . however, a large number of transcripts with altered expression in sw93- <dig> were also differentially expressed in desiree , indicating that sw93- <dig> might recognize more cues from p. infestans than sarpo mira.

similar to the transcriptome patterns, several proteins that differed in abundance overlapped between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi within clones, as seen in the volcano plots . at  <dig> hpi, however, several more proteins differentially accumulated compared with earlier time-points . in addition, a larger number of proteins decreased in abundance in desiree compared with sarpo mira and sw93- <dig> . a corresponding difference in down-regulated transcripts was not observed. instead, a much larger number of up-regulated transcripts was seen in desiree at  <dig> hpi compared with the incompatible interactions, as mentioned above. a large number of proteins that increased in abundance were common in all three potato clones . in addition, a higher percentage of proteins with increased abundance were observed during incompatible interactions in the apoplastic secretome data  compared with transcript data where larger number of differentially expressed transcripts were observed in the compatible interaction .figure  <dig>

responses during incompatible interactions
a hallmark for plant resistance towards pathogens is the initiation of the hr reaction, but in crops relatively little is known about the genes involved. among the differentially expressed transcripts we found  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> transcripts at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi, respectively, that were up-regulated in both resistant potato clones but not in susceptible desiree . some of these genes such as the myb transcription factors, glutaredoxins, ring zinc finger proteins and u-box proteins, have members that have previously been associated with resistance . there were  <dig> different go terms uniquely enriched for the early  incompatible interaction . similarly we found  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> secreted proteins at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi, respectively, with increased abundance in the two incompatible interactions but not in the compatible interaction . these include a subtilisin-like protease, kunitz-like protease inhibitors, lipid transfer proteins, defensins and strictosidine synthase. these genes and proteins can be regarded as candidate involved in initiation of hr and resistance against p. infestans.figure  <dig> 
number of enriched go terms based on the gene expression analyses of the three potato clones desiree, sarpo mira and sw93- <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi.




mapman pathway analyses reveal that a majority of the represented myb transcription factors are down-regulated at  <dig> hpi in desiree, whereas the opposite is true for sarpo mira and sw93- <dig> . in contrast, several wrky transcription factors are down-regulated in all three clones at  <dig> hpi.

in order to identify testable hr initiation candidates, we took a conservative approach and identified genes that were 4-fold up-regulated only in the resistant cultivars at  <dig> or 24 h, at the rna  and protein  level. only four of the  <dig> transcripts were differentially regulated in the apoplast . the  <dig> secreted proteins which accumulated early in resistant clones indicate that this compartment is active in hr initiation or other early resistance mechanisms . notable proteins from the apoplast are the rcr3-like phytophthora-inhibited protease  <dig> , the aspartic protease nepenthesin- <dig> and a kunitz-like protease inhibitor. these findings show that the proteolytic machinery of potato plays an important role in defense against pathogens. in line with these findings, tomato plants with mutated rcr <dig>  which is related to pip <dig>  have enhanced susceptibility to p. infestans
 <cit> . several hydrolytic enzymes are also identified and these might exhibit novel catalytic specificities evolved to assist in eti.table  <dig>

proteins with increased abundance in the secretome for the two incompatible clones sarpo mira and sw93- <dig>  but not for compatible desirée. proteins with a minimum 4-fold increase in both sarpo mira and sw93- <dig> at  <dig> or  <dig> hpi and stable or decreased abundance in desirée at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi were selected. up-regulation is indicated with an asterisk. the symbol † indicates proteins that were not identified using at least one peptide specific for the listed gene. symbol  indicates the time point in which the change was observed.



general defense and the susceptible interaction
there was a clear overlap between differentially expressed transcripts in both the incompatible and compatible interactions  demonstrating that there are common sets of genes differentially expressed independently of the type of interaction. at  <dig> hpi there is a large overlap between all three clones in enriched go terms  with many go terms linked to primary metabolism, but also general signaling mechanisms such as protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activity. a change in primary metabolism and brassinosteroid-related processes is then seen throughout the time course in all three clones . between the three clones at  <dig> hpi, the mapman pathway analysis shows a striking similarity for c2h2-co-like and c2h2-dof zinc finger containing transcription factors indicating that these might be involved in general defense . there are a large number of go terms only enriched in the compatible interaction . in hormone-related processes, auxin transport and stimulus go terms are unique to the compatible interaction, and this is also true for gibberellin biosynthesis and stimulus. at  <dig> hpi a large number of go terms are significantly enriched in desiree. it is the only time point where functional groups associated with jasmonic acid and systemic acquired resistance are present, and is in line with the start of the necrotrophic phase of the pathogen. also, several histone-related genes can be seen to be up-regulated in desiree, whereas this is the case for only a few members in sw93- <dig> and none in sarpo mira.

screen for putative effector targets in the apoplast
although the use of effector targets in resistance breeding is desirable  <cit> , very few of such proteins have been identified in oomycete–plant interactions. we detected many secreted proteins that decreased in abundances during the compatible interaction. this is in line with a suppression of some secreted proteins by pathogen effectors or a faster degradation due to protein-complex formation. p. infestans effector can suppress secretion of a defense protein is exemplified by the cysteine protease c <dig>  <cit> . we found that the c <dig> protease decreased sharply at  <dig> hpi in the desiree apoplast even though it increased at transcript level at this time point validating bozkurt et al’s findings in tomato . this inspired two strategies to screen for putative effector targets in our quantitative apoplastic secretome data.figure  <dig> 
gene expression and protein abundance in the apoplast of known effector target cysteine protease c <dig>  transcript and protein levels of the effector target cysteine protease c <dig> decreased at  <dig> hpi in the desiree apoplast and at the same time was transitionally up regulated.



firstly, we selected proteins with a minimum of 8-fold decreased in abundance in the susceptible clone at  <dig> and 24 h after infection. this selection produced  <dig> candidates, many of which are single proteins from large gene families . these proteins may also be putative targets in the incompatible interactions because at early time points secreted effectors are expected to be present in all interactions.

secondly, we performed clustering by stem, in order to find protein abundance patterns that occur during compatible and incompatible interactions in the apoplast. among  <dig> profiles with significant numbers of associated proteins in desiree, we found five profiles  containing in total  <dig> proteins with lower abundance in the apoplast. in contrast, only one significant profile in sarpo mira  and none in sw93- <dig>  represented proteins with lower abundance . in addition, one of the profiles representing proteins with higher abundance , was only significant for sw93- <dig> and sarpo mira, and represented a large number of proteins for these clones,  <dig> and  <dig> proteins respectively .table  <dig>

in order to find putative effector-targeted proteins that are differentially regulated in compatible and incompatible interactions, we selected candidates from profiles containing proteins with increased levels in the two incompatible interactions  and compared them with the proteins associated with profiles representing decreased levels in the compatible interaction  . we found  <dig> proteins from both incompatible interaction profiles with increased abundance that showed decreased accumulation in the compatible interaction . these included a lyase, a pectinesterase, a kunitz trypsin inhibitor and a dehydratase. in addition, we found  <dig> proteins with decreased abundance profiles in desiree  but with increased abundance profiles in sw93- <dig> . eight proteins with decreased abundance profiles in desiree were found in the increased abundance profiles of sarpo mira .

discussion
we have carried out time course studies of one compatible and two incompatible interactions between p. infestans and potato by global transcriptomics and apoplastic proteomics using potato clones desiree, sarpo mira, and sw93- <dig>  in response to p. infestans infection, there was a large overlap of transcripts and proteins with changed abundance irrespective of compatibility, which can be seen as a common signature for challenge with phytophthora . among the differentially abundant proteins found in the apoplast, 50% were also differentially expressed at the transcript level . this is in line with previously reported data from yeast that showed that regulation of mrna explains around 40% of the protein concentration changes  <cit> , and demonstrates the value of measuring both transcript and protein levels.

we identified more than  <dig> proteins in the apoplast; almost half of these are associated with  <dig> conserved functional domains . the wide range of functional categories among apoplastic secretome suggests a high complexity in this protein fraction. among the identified proteins 30% had a secretory signal predicted by targetp, which is consistent with other apoplastic proteomics studies and suggests that a large proportion of the secreted proteins are secreted through unconventional secretory pathways  <cit> .

at  <dig> hpi, a higher number of apoplast proteins increased in both incompatible interactions than in the compatible interaction, demonstrating a quicker response during the incompatible interaction . this difference is even clearer at  <dig> hpi, when the number of proteins with increased abundance in the incompatible interactions is almost twice that of the compatible interaction. another notable difference in the apoplast at this stage is that more proteins decreased in abundance in the compatible interaction compared to the incompatible interactions. interestingly, we did not observe this difference in the transcriptome, indicating a more pronounced suppression by effectors on secreted proteins than on transcription. at  <dig> hpi, substantially more genes were induced in the compatible interaction than in the incompatible interactions. most of these genes may have a role in metabolic and structural re-modeling due to infection.

although the total protein content is greater in the compatible interaction , fewer proteins show increased abundance. this suggests that the composition of the apoplastic secretome is important in the incompatible interaction and that certain apoplastic proteins are suppressed by the pathogen during the compatible interaction . major proteins that accumulated in the susceptible interaction were glucanases and glucosidases  that might be involved in symptom development, as many more cells were visibly affected in the compatible interaction than in the incompatible interactions  <cit> . evidence that the apoplastic secretome is altered during pathogen attack has previously been found in cell cultures  <cit> , but such a large-scale perturbation of the host apoplastic secretome in planta is unprecedented.

little is known about the genes involved in development of hr in potato. there were few genes that were uniquely induced in both resistant potato clones; notably glutaredoxins, myb transcription factors and a zinc finger protein . plants with impaired glutaredoxin activity are resistant to the necrotroph botrytis
 <cit>  and sa-inducible glutaredoxin is involved in suppression of the jasmonic acid-responsive genes in arabidopsis
 <cit> , suggesting a role in hormone crosstalk during the defense response. plant u-box proteins, also unique to incompatible interactions, is a gene family with diverse functions linked to salicylic acid and pad <dig> mediated pathways  <cit> . wrky transcription factors did not show this pattern and many were initially down-regulated, although wrky <dig> has been implicated in defense-related mapk signaling and p. infestans resistance in nicotiana benthamiana
 <cit> .

sarpo mira, which carries five different resistance genes  <cit> , showed relatively few changes after challenge with p. infestans. this might be due to specific r gene recognition and responses to p. infestans. although the difference between specific responses in the two resistant genotypes was large, both still display full resistance against the pathogen and initiate similar macroscopic hr in detached leaf assays  <cit> . our analysis suggests the possibility that pathogen recognition occurs differently in sarpo mira and sw93- <dig>  sarpo mira might mainly depend on effector recognition by resistance proteins, while sw93- <dig> may have additional recognition and response mechanisms. at  <dig> hpi in sw93- <dig> two lrr receptor-like kinases are induced, perhaps leading to defense responses unique to sw93- <dig> 

the fact that certain proteins in the apoplast might be selectively suppressed during the compatible interaction but not the incompatible interactions allows us to screen for putative effector targets. in this unique type of screening described here, we found several candidates that were single proteins from large gene families. in addition to the well characterized cysteine protease  <dig> , we found another cysteine protease  as well as a cystatin homologue . two other proteins of interest were a kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor  and a subtilase family protein  that also was identified in this screen. with the exact identity of these genes it is now possible to investigate these functionally.

CONCLUSIONS
we carried out a time course study of potato transcriptomic and proteomic responses after p. infestans inoculation, both in compatible and incompatible interactions. studying samples from the same time course for both gene expression and protein abundance lead to identification of potential targets for plant proteins directly manipulated by the pathogen. by using two phenotypically different resistant potato clones we identify several transcripts and proteins that only show increased expression or abundance in both incompatible potato clones that are potentially involved in resistance. in summary, we provide ample number of transcripts and proteins that could be used in targeted studies on one of the most agriculturally important plant-pathogen interactions.
