BACKGROUND
diacylglycerol kinase  phosphorylates diacylglycerol  to generate phosphatidic acid   <cit> . dg, which is liberated from phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphste and phosphatidylcholine upon cell stimulation, regulates a wide range of cellular functions. for instance, dg is an allosteric activator of conventional and novel protein kinase cs , unc- <dig> and ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein  <cit> . therefore, dgk consumes dg and is thus responsible for attenuating dg-mediated signals. pa, the reaction product of dgk, has also been reported to regulate a number of signaling proteins such as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, ras gtpase-activating protein, c-raf, mammalian target of rapamycin and atypical pkc  <cit> . therefore, dgk is thought to play roles not only in the downregulation of dg signaling but also in the production of another lipid mediator, pa.

it is well known that dgk represents a large enzyme family. ten mammalian dgk isozymes, namely α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, and κ, which contain two or three characteristic cysteine-rich, zinc finger-like c <dig> domains and the catalytic region in common, are subdivided into five groups according to their structural features  <cit> . the type ii dgk  <cit>  comprises the δ  <cit> , η  <cit>  and κ  <cit>  isozymes. the occurrence of alternative splicing was reported for dgkδ   <cit>  and dgkη   <cit> . all of the type ii dgk isoforms possess a pleckstrin homology domain at their n termini and a separated catalytic domain, and dgks δ <dig>  δ <dig> and η <dig> but not dgks η <dig> and κ contain a sterile α-motif domain at their c termini. it has been reported that dgks δ <dig>  δ <dig> and η <dig> formed oligomers through interactions among their sterile α-motif domains and that this oligomer formation regulates the activities and subcellular localizations of these dgk isoforms  <cit> . dgks δ <dig> and κ contain the pro-rich  <dig> residues  <cit>  and the  <dig> tandem repeats of glu-pro-ala-pro  <cit>  extending from the n terminus, respectively.

based on the analysis of dgkδ-knockout mice, it was recently reported that dgkδ regulates the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in epithelial cells of the lung and skin  <cit>  and insulin receptor signaling in skeletal muscle  <cit>  by modulating pkc activity. we recently reported that dgkη is expressed in stomach cancer and hela cervical cancer cells and that it is required for the ras/b-raf/c-raf/mek/erk signaling cascade, which is activated by the epidermal growth factor  <cit> . type ii dgks have been implicated in several diseases  <cit> . for example, dgkδ is a key enzyme that prevents insulin resistance and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . a female patient with a disrupted dgkδ gene who exhibits seizures and a psychiatric disorder was found  <cit> . dgkη was reported to be involved in lung cancer  <cit> . a genome-wide association study implicated the dgkη gene in the etiology of bipolar disorder  <cit> . a genome-wide association study also indicated a potential relationship between dgkκ and hypospadias  <cit> .

several reports have revealed that dgkδ, η and κ are abundantly expressed in the reproductive organs, testis and ovary  <cit> . however, the functions of dgks δ, η and κ in the reproductive organs remain unclear, and not even their detailed distribution patterns in the organs have been revealed. therefore, in this study, we examined the expression and spatial distribution of the dgks δ <dig>  η <dig> and κ proteins and mrnas in the mouse reproductive organs. the results indicate distinct expression patterns, which were obviously different from each other. moreover, we found a new splice variant of dgkη, dgkη <dig>  which was specifically expressed in the testis.

RESULTS
expression of dgkδ, η and κ in the mouse reproductive organs
we first confirmed the expression of dgkδ mrna and protein in the mouse reproductive organs: the testis, ovary and uterus. the 999-bp cdna fragment amplified from dgkδ mrna was strongly detected in the testis and ovary and was clearly observed in the uterus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  . the western blot analysis showed that the dgkδ <dig> protein  was substantially expressed in the testis and ovary and, to a lesser extent, in the uterus . the dgkδ <dig> protein  was not detectable in the reproductive organs .figure  <dig> 
expression of type ii dgk mrnas  and proteins  in the reproductive organs: testis, ovary and uterus.  rt-pcr analysis of the mrna from the reproductive organs was performed: testes from 12-week-old male mice and ovaries and uteruses from 12-week-old female mice. the panels show that 999-bp cdna fragments were amplified for dgkδ , 826-bp cdna fragments were amplified for dgkη , 842-bp cdna fragments were amplified for dgkκ  and 978-bp cdna fragments were amplified for mouse glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase , as determined through agarose gel electrophoresis. the asterisk indicates a ~730-bp band that was amplified from the testis mrna. representatives of five independent experiments with five male and five female mice are shown.  the protein samples  from the indicated tissues of 10-week-old male and female mice were detected by western blotting using anti-dgkδ and dgkη antibodies. representatives of five independent experiments with five male and five female mice are shown.



the rt-pcr results demonstrated that dgkη mrna was expressed strongly in the testis and ovary and moderately expressed in the uterus . the rt-pcr product using dgkη mrna from the testis  was shorter than those obtained from the ovary and uterus  . therefore, the shorter product  is specifically generated in the testis. the western blot analysis showed that the dgkη <dig> protein  was strongly detected in the ovary and uterus . the dgkη <dig> protein was detected at a slightly higher position  in the sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results than that corresponding to the calculated molecular mass . the dgkη <dig> protein   <cit> ) was not detected in the reproductive organs.

the sequence analysis of the rt-pcr product amplified from the testis mrna revealed that the shorter mrna  is an alternative splicing product of the dgkη gene in which exon  <dig> is skipped . therefore, we designate this product dgkη <dig>  exon  <dig> of the dgkη gene contains 93 bp and encodes  <dig> amino acid residues. therefore, no frame shift occurs due to alternative splicing. the exon/intron boundaries between exons  <dig> and  <dig> fulfill the gt/ag rule . in addition to the ovary and uterus, the 733-bp band failed to be detected in the epididymis, sperm, vesicula seminalis, prostate gland, brain and neuro 2a neuroblastoma cells . these results further strongly suggest that dgkη <dig> is specifically expressed in the testis. the alternative splicing product is anticipated to produce a shorter dgkη protein with an expected molecular mass of 125 kda . we detected a 129-kda band that reacted with anti-dgkη antibody in the testis . however, we found that this band was also detected  in the extracts from the testis of a recently created dgkη-knockout mouse . therefore, although dgkη <dig> mrna was strongly expressed in the testis , its protein band has not yet been identified . the dgkη <dig> protein may be unstable and quickly degraded.figure  <dig>

dgkκ mrna was modestly expressed in the testis, ovary and uterus . dgkκ protein was not detected in these mouse reproductive organs by western blotting using anti-human dgkκ antibody . anti-dgkκ antibody against human dgkκ  <cit>  may not effectively recognize the murine dgkκ protein.

distribution of dgkδ, η and κ mrnas in the testis
we then performed in situ hybridization using the anti-sense probe to examine the spatial distribution of dgkδ <dig> mrna in the mouse testis . although the testis sections were also hybridized with the sense probe as a control, no distinct staining was detected . as shown in figure  <dig>  dgkδ mrna was mainly expressed in primary spermatocytes. the mrna was moderately detected in the spermatogonia and, to a lesser extent, in the secondary spermatocytes. however, no obvious staining of dgkδ mrna was detected in the round and elongated spermatids and the leydig cells. the expression intensities of dgkδ in these testicular cells are summarized in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
this study provides the first detailed demonstration of the expression and distribution of the type ii dgk isozymes dgkδ, η and κ in the mouse reproductive organs. dgkδ, η and κ were expressed in the mouse reproductive organs, namely the testis, ovary and uterus. however, their expression patterns were obviously different from each other.

exon  <dig>  which encodes  <dig> amino acid residues, is skipped in the new alternative splicing product of the dgkη gene, which is denoted dgkη <dig> . dgkη <dig> was strongly expressed in the secondary spermatocytes and the round spermatids and was not detected in other tissues, such as the ovary, uterus, epididymis, sperm, vesicula seminalis, prostate gland, brain and neuro 2a neuroblastoma cells , implying that dgkη <dig> is specifically expressed in the testis, particularly in the secondary spermatocytes and the round spermatids. therefore, this isoform plays a specialized role in these testicular cells. it is interesting to investigate the functional difference that is generated by the absence of exon  <dig>  although a motif search was carried out, no obvious functional motifs were not found in the 31-amino acid sequence encoded by exon  <dig>  a protein database search indicated that the 31-amino acid sequence showed high similarity  in 29-aa overlap) with the c-terminal region  of promyelocytic leukemia protein isoform  <dig>  which is a tumor suppressor of acute promyelocytic leukemia  <cit> . however, the function of the region of promyelocytic leukemia protein isoform  <dig> has not been revealed. therefore, the function of the 31-amino acid sequence lacking in dgkη <dig> remains unclear at present.

in the testis, different expression patterns of type ii dgks were observed. during the process of spermatogenesis, the primary spermatocytes are developed from the spermatogonia through mitosis  <cit> . the secondary spermatocytes are then derived from the primary spermatocytes via the first meiotic division. moreover, the round spermatids are generated from the secondary spermatocytes through the second meiotic division. dgkδ <dig> mrna was mainly expressed in the spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes . strong staining of dgkκ was detected in the primary and secondary spermatocytes . dgkη <dig> mrna was strongly expressed in the secondary spermatocytes and the round spermatids . these results imply that dgks δ <dig>  η <dig> and κ are involved in mitosis and the first and second meiotic divisions, respectively. the sperm fertilization-related protein equatorin, which is involved in fusion with the oolemma, was reported to be strongly expressed in secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids and was weakly detected in the primary spermatocytes  <cit> . this expression pattern of equatorin is very similar to that of dgkη <dig> . therefore, equatorin and dgkη <dig> may be functionally linked to each other.

a genome-wide association study indicated that dgkκ is involved in hypospadias  <cit> . hypospadias is thought to relate to androgen production  <cit> . androgen is mainly produced in leydig cells  <cit> . however, dgkκ was not detected in leydig cells. moreover, the expression pattern of dgkκ was not similar to that of androgen receptor, which was mainly expressed in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes  <cit> . therefore, a relationship between the distribution pattern of dgkκ and hypospadias was not found in this study.

in the ovary, dgkη <dig> mrna was strongly expressed in the granulosa cells  of the primary and secondary follicles and modestly detected in the mature follicles and corpus luteum . because granulosa cells are vigorously proliferated in the primary and secondary follicles during the maturation of ovarian follicles  <cit> , it is possible that dgkη <dig> is involved in the proliferation of granulosa cells. we reported that dgkη <dig> enhances cell proliferation through the activation of c-raf  <cit> . mcphillips, f. et al. reported that c-raf , which is expressed in granulosa cells, mediates growth factor-stimulated growth in ovarian cancer  <cit> . therefore, these results allow us to speculate that dgkη <dig> is involved in ovarian carcinogenesis through the activation of c-raf . dgkδ <dig> mrna was also expressed in the granulosa cells  of the primary and secondary follicles and modestly detected in the mature follicles and corpus luteum . however, its expression levels were not changed during the follicle development. therefore, the function of dgkδ <dig> is likely different from that of dgkη <dig> 

dgkη <dig> mrna was strongly expressed in the luminal epithelium of the uterus , and dgkδ <dig> and κ mrnas were weakly detected in these cells. similar to the granulosa cells in the ovary, the luminal epithelium proliferates during the estrus cycle  <cit> . epidermal growth factor receptor is known to be highly expressed in the luminal epithelium  <cit> . among type ii dgks, dgkη <dig> enhances cell proliferation downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor  <cit> , and dgkδ <dig> activates epidermal growth factor receptor through inactivation of protein kinase c  <cit> . therefore, these dgk isoforms may positively regulate proliferation through the receptor in the luminal epithelium.

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that the spatial expression patterns of dgks δ <dig>  η <dig>  η <dig> and κ in the murine reproductive organs are different from each other. these results support the hypothesis that dgks δ <dig>  η <dig>  η <dig> and κ can play specific roles in distinct compartments and developmental stages of the reproductive organs, especially in the processes of spermatogenesis and oocyte maturation. in addition, we revealed the existence of a new alternative splicing product of dgkη, which we denoted dgkη <dig>  we recently established dgkη-knockout mice . to analyze the reproductive organ-related phenotypes of the knockout mice, it is important to understand the expression patterns of dgkη in the reproductive organs. studies are underway to examine the physiological functions of dgkη <dig> and η <dig> in the reproductive organs using the newly established dgkη-knockout mice.
