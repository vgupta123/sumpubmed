BACKGROUND
the zebrafish iguana gene, also referred to as dzip <dig> , has three protein isoforms, each with a single c2h <dig> zinc finger domain but no other defined domain  <cit> . the biological role of dzip <dig> is still not clearly defined and it has been reported to be involved in the regulation of various molecular processes. the dzip <dig> protein is a component of the hedgehog  signaling pathway and has a putative regulatory role in hh signaling and ciliogenesis  <cit> . the hh signaling pathway is involved in many processes during embryonic development and remains active in adults, where it controls cell growth, survival and fate  <cit> . the principal mediators of the transcriptional response to hh are members of the zinc finger-containing gli protein family  <cit> . in vertebrates, gli processing requires an intact primary cilium, which is a microtubule-based organelle on the cell surface. the integrity of the primary cilium is essential for mammalian hh signaling  <cit> . dzip <dig> regulates gli turnover through stabilizing speckle-type poz protein  independent of its role in ciliogenesis  <cit> . dzip <dig> is located at the basal body of the primary cilium  <cit> . kim et al.  suggested that dzip <dig> may be an essential component of a protein complex involved in the biogenesis of the primary cilium.

human dzip <dig> associates with the rna-binding protein daz in embryonic stem cells and germ cells, which led to the suggestion that it is involved in mrna regulation  <cit> . the proteins of the daz family  activate the translation of particular mrnas in metazoan germ cells  <cit>  by interacting with the poly-binding protein   <cit> . it has also been suggested that proteins of the daz family transport target transcripts to rna granules  <cit> . moreover, dazl is an essential component of stress granules, which prevent male germ cells from undergoing apoptosis in conditions of heat stress  <cit> . thus, dzip <dig> may be a component of ribonucleoprotein  complexes.

we show here that dzip <dig> is located predominantly in granules in the cytoplasm and that it is a component of ribonucleoprotein complexes in hela cells. we also found that dzip <dig> is associated with polysomes and colocalizes with tia- <dig> in stress granules, but not with p-bodies, suggesting a role in the localization of mrnas within the body of the cell. ribonomic analysis of associated mrnas identified networks of genes involved principally in cell cycle regulation and gene expression. our results suggest that dzip <dig> is part of an rna localization complex involved in regulating the cellular trafficking of a defined subpopulation of mrnas.

RESULTS
dzip <dig> is present predominantly in the cytoplasm of hela cells
we used indirect immunofluorescence with an anti-dzip <dig> antibody and amino-gfp or carboxy-yfp-tagged hdzip <dig> proteins to investigate the subcellular distribution of dzip <dig> in hela cells. dzip <dig> labeling showed a granular pattern in the cytoplasm, with a slightly stronger signal in the perinuclear region . furthermore, we observed some nuclear staining with the anti-dzip <dig> antibody. we sought to confirm these results and transfected cells with a vector encoding a carboxy-gfp-tagged dzip <dig> and observed after 24Â hours. the tagged-dzip <dig> protein was also present mostly in the cytoplasm . we observed a similar pattern when hek <dig> cells were transfected with this construct, although the granular distribution was less evident than in hela cells . we also obtained similar results when we transfected cells with an amino-yfp-tagged dzip <dig> construct . we used the pgfp or pyfp plasmid as a control .

zebrafish iguana proteins  are located at the basal body of primary cilia  <cit> . the human dzip <dig> protein has also been reported to be present in the basal body of htert-rpe <dig> cells   <cit> . we therefore investigated the distribution of gfp-tagged dzip <dig> in htert-rpe <dig> cells, using an anti-acetylated tubulin antibody to visualize the primary cilium  <cit>  . although the vast majority of dzip <dig> signal is restricted to foci distributed throughout the cytoplasm , we cannot discard that at least a small fraction of the protein might localize to the base of the cilium . we obtained similar results with the yfp construct, but the signal was less intense . the combination of diffuse and granular patterns of dzip <dig> staining in the cytoplasm suggests that at least some of the protein is present in high molecular weight protein complexes. we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  assays to determine the mobile/immobile fraction of gfp-tagged dzip <dig>  the mean mobile fraction was  <dig>   and the immobile fraction was  <dig>   . the immobile fraction was larger than this mean value if photobleaching was carried out close to the nucleus . these findings indicate that the dzip <dig> protein is partitioned between soluble and insoluble forms.

dzip <dig> is recruited to stress granules in cells subjected to oxidative stress
dazl colocalizes with tia <dig>  a stress granule marker, in hela cells under oxidative stress conditions  <cit> . dzip <dig> interacts with the daz and dazl proteins in embryonic stem cells and germ cells  <cit> . thus, dzip <dig> may be a component of regulatory rna granules. we used live cell imaging to observe dzip1-gfp-expressing cells subjected to cold-shock treatment. within a few minutes, dzip <dig> was concentrated in cytoplasmic granules, the number and intensity of which increased over time . we performed immunofluorescence assays with anti-dzip <dig> and anti-tia <dig> antibodies in transfected hela cells subjected to normal or oxidative stress conditions to investigate whether these granules corresponded to extensively studied stress granules . in normal conditions , dzip <dig> colocalized with tia- <dig> in the nucleus . arsenite treatment induced the formation of stress granules at concentrations of  <dig>  mm -  <dig> mm, as demonstrated by labeling for tia- <dig>  dzip <dig> mostly colocalized with tia-1-containing granules . interestingly, some dzip1-containing granules were not stress granules, although the colocalization of dzip <dig> with these granules was less robust than with stress granules. we verified that the tia- <dig> signal was not leaking back into the fitc channel . we investigated whether dzip <dig> was present in other rna granules, such as p-bodies, by labeling the cells for dcp <dig> which is a p-body marker. dzip <dig> did not colocalize with this marker in hela cells either in normal conditions  or under oxidative stress . these results suggest that dzip <dig> participates in ribonucleoprotein complexes under normal and stress conditions.

dzip <dig> is a component of ribonucleoprotein complexes and is associated with a particular subpopulation of mrnas
dzip protein interacts with daz  in embryonic stem cells and germ cells  <cit> . the genes of the daz family encode rna-binding proteins  <cit> . we therefore carried out immunoprecipitation assays with anti-dzip <dig> antibodies to determine whether dzip <dig> was present in ribonucleoprotein complexes in hela cells in normal conditions and to identify the mrnas with which it was associated. we confirmed the presence of dzip <dig> in the immunoprecipitates by western blotting  and we identified the mrnas present in the immunoprecipitates by microarray hybridization, with a genechip affymetrix human genome u <dig> plus  <dig>  array . as a control, we used a rabbit isotype igg antibody . all signals that were two-fold higher than the control were considered as positive. in total,  <dig> genes displayed four-fold enrichment, and  <dig> displayed two-fold enrichment in the dzip <dig> elutes . we tested twelve microarray-positive candidates by quantitative rt-pcr to validate our microarray results . we chose to analyze genes associated with the hedgehog signaling pathway , genes associated with cilia or intraflagellar transport , motor proteins and their associated proteins  and randomly selected genes with different levels of fold change . ten of them showed statistically significant enrichment in the dzip1-ip fractions.

we also transfected hela cells with a plasmid encoding gfp-tagged dzip <dig>  and carried out immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-gfp antibody. we used cells transfected with pgfp alone as a negative control. we reverse transcribed the mrnas associated with the immunoprecipitated gfp-tagged dzip <dig> and analyzed the same  <dig> microarray-positive candidate genes by quantitative pcr all of them being enriched in this fraction .

we analyzed the functional relationships between dzip1-associated mrnas by assigning biological functions on the basis of gene ontology terms, and we used ipa to identify the gene networks formed by the transcripts. go analysis showed enrichment in regulatory proteins. ipa identified gene networks involved in the control of cell growth, gene expression and cellular compromise .

bingenuity pathway analysis networks: functions associated with the networks regulated by dzip <dig> 

dzip <dig> contains a single c2h <dig> zinc finger domain. zinc finger proteins are generally thought of as dna-binding transcription factors. however, some classes of zinc finger proteins, including the common c2h <dig> zinc fingers, function as rna-binding proteins  <cit> . we used emsa to investigate the ability of dzip <dig> to interact directly with rnas. we produced a myc-tagged protein in 293t cells and purified this protein by affinity chromatography . we subsequently used this recombinant protein in emsa with four homoribopolymer probes. under the conditions used, dzip <dig> did not interact robustly with the rna probes, even in the most permissive condition tested . these results suggest that dzip <dig> is associated with an rna binding protein which is associated directly with the mrna population.

the expression of dzip <dig> and its mrnas targets is affected by inhibition of the hh pathway
dzip <dig> has been described as a component of the hh signaling cascade. cyclopamine is a specific hh inhibitor that blocks the activation of the hh pathway by binding directly to smo  <cit> . we first incubated hela cells with various concentrations of cyclopamine and determined the shortest time and the minimum concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation . we evaluated proliferation by the incorporation of brdu. the rate of cell proliferation was lower in cells incubated for  <dig> hours with  <dig> nm or  <dig> nm cyclopamine than in control cells. we assessed the abundance of gli <dig> mrna, a positive effector of hh signaling, to evaluate the molecular effect of cyclopamine treatment   <cit> . the abundance of gli <dig> mrna was considerably lower in cells incubated with  <dig> nm cyclopamine than in control cells. we examined cell cycle progression and apoptosis to determine the optimal concentration of cyclosporine to block the hh pathway without modifying the cell cycle or viability. cell cycle progression and the percentage of apoptotic cells were similar in cells treated with  <dig> nm cyclopamine for  <dig> hours and in untreated control cells . we therefore incubated cells with  <dig> nm cyclopamine for  <dig> hours in subsequent experiments.we investigated the effect of blocking the hh pathway on the subcellular distribution of dzip <dig>  we treated hela cells with cyclopamine and carried out immunolocalization assays with an anti-dzip <dig> antibody. fewer granules were present in the cytoplasm in cells in which the hh pathway was blocked with cyclopamine than in untreated control cells . moreover, the nuclear signal was completely absent after treatment. the low number of granules and absence of nuclear signal may be connected with inhibition of the hh signaling pathway.

we investigated the abundance of dzip <dig> and gli <dig> transcripts and that of two dzip1-associated mrnas  after treatment with cyclopamine for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours. blockade of the hh pathway prevented the accumulation of the dzip <dig> and gli <dig> transcripts . this treatment also promoted the accumulation of ptch <dig> and brd <dig> transcripts . the high abundance of ptch <dig> and brd <dig> mrna may be a direct effect of blocking the hh pathway or may be due to an impairment in dzip <dig> expression.

knockdown of dzip <dig> expression affects cell proliferation
we used dzip1-specific sirna molecules to investigate the role of dzip <dig> and its effect on its associated mrnas and determined whether the silencing of dzip <dig> resulted in phenotypic changes or altered the abundance of associated mrnas. we transfected hela cells with a mixture of dzip <dig> sirnas at a concentration of  <dig> nm and examined dzip <dig> expression at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h after transfection . western blotting showed that the abundance of dzip <dig> in protein extracts from transfected cells at  <dig> h was half that in cells transfected with a scrambled control , thus confirming the knockdown of dzip <dig> expression . dzip <dig> knockdown had no significant effect on cell morphology. we carried out annexin v assays to evaluate the survival rate of dzip1-knockdown cells  <dig> hours after transfection by determining the percentage of living, apoptotic and dead cells. we found no significant differences between dzip1-knockdown cells and control cells . propidium iodide staining also showed no differences in the percentages of the cells in the g <dig>  s and g <dig> phases of the cell cycle .

kikuyama et al.  recently described dzip <dig> as a putative tumor suppressor gene. indeed, dzip1-knockdown in breast cancer cell lines promotes cell growth. we assessed the putative role for dzip <dig> in the control of cell proliferation by evaluating the effect of dzip <dig> knockdown on the proliferation of hela cells. growth curves showed that the knockdown population contained a higher number of dividing cells than the control population, as previously reported for tumor cells .

dzip <dig> knockdown and overexpression do not affect the accumulation or stability of mrnas associated with dzip1-containing complexes but modify the quantity of stress granules per cell
rnp complexes control the fate of bound mrnas by regulating their stability, translation or subcellular localization  <cit> . we evaluated the abundance of ift <dig>  snx <dig>  brd <dig> and patch <dig> mrna in dzip1-knockdown cells. we used gli <dig> mrna as a non-target control. there was no statistical difference in the abundance of any of these mrna  between knockdown and control cells, although knockdown cells tended to have higher levels of these transcripts than control cells .

we next examined the relationship between the amount of dzip <dig> and the accumulation of associated mrnas in dzip1-containing complexes in cells overexpressing dzip1-gfp. we found that the abundance of the dzip1-associated mrnas ift <dig>  snx <dig>  brd <dig>  and ptch <dig> and the control mrna gli <dig> were unaffected by the strong overexpression of dzip <dig> .

we sought to investigate the potential role of dzip <dig> in the regulation of the stability of the mrna targets of rnp complexes; therefore, we used quantitative rt-pcr to determine the half-lives of mrnas associated with dzip <dig> in cells treated with actinomycin d. we transfected cells with sidzip <dig> or sinc <dig> and treated them with the transcriptional inhibitor  for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours at  <dig> hours after transfection. we used quantitative rt-pcr to determine the mean relative mrna levels at each time point after the addition of act d, and plotted these values to calculate the half-life of brd <dig>  ift <dig>  snx <dig> and ptch <dig> mrna. there was no significant difference in the half-lives of these four dzip1-associated mrnas between dzip1-knockdown cells and control cells . we counted the number of stress granules per cell after  <dig> hours of transfection in dzip1-knockdown cells grown in oxidative stress conditions, using tia <dig> as a stress granule marker. the number of stress granules per cell was significantly lower in the dzip1-knockdown cells than in the control  cells . these results indicate that dzip <dig> participates in the formation of stress granules upon oxidative stress.

dzip <dig> is associated with polysomes
we evaluated the presence of dzip <dig> in the polysomal fraction to analyze the association of dzip <dig> with macromolecules involved in translation. we treated cells transfected with pdzip1-gfp with cycloheximide to stabilize ribosome-mrna complexes or with puromycin to disassemble ribosomes, and we separated cytoplasmic extracts by sucrose gradient sedimentation to isolate distinct ribosome populations . we carried out western blotting to examine the distribution of dzip1-gfp in both conditions using an antibody against gfp. western blots shown in figureÂ 6a and b were used for quantification . dzip1-gfp was present in fractions 1â <dig> comprising 40s, 60s, 80s or monosomes and in polysome fractions. when cells were treated with puromycin, gfp-dzip <dig> was only detected in the ribosome-free fractions , demonstrating that dzip1-gfp is associated with translationally active ribosomes.dzip <dig> protein complexes may regulate the translation of the associated mrnas. we tested this hypothesis by carrying out western blots with extracts of cells transfected with gfp-tagged pdzip <dig>  pgfp, sidzip <dig> or sinc <dig>  using anti-snx <dig>  anti-gfp and/or anti-gapdh antibodies. the amount of snx <dig> protein was similar in all conditions . although we analyzed only one target of dzip, these results nonetheless indicate that dzip <dig> does not influence the abundance proteins encoded by the associated mrnas.our results suggest that dzip <dig> is a component of ribonucleoprotein complexes. dzip <dig> does not regulate the expression of its associated mrnas but is probably responsible for the subcellular localization of these transcripts to various types of ribonucleoprotein complexes . thus, dzip <dig> may be involved in the trafficking of its target mrnas within the cell, i.e. between the nucleus, cytoplasm, stress granules and polysomes.

discussion
in this study, we found that dzip <dig> was present mostly in the cytoplasm of hela cells and that this subcellular distribution was modified by external stimuli. ribonomic analysis showed that dzip <dig> was present in rnp complexes and was associated with a population of mrnas involved principally in cell cycle regulation and the response to hedgehog signaling.

human dzip <dig> and dzipl are required for the formation of primary cilia  <cit> . dzip <dig> is located at the basal body of cilia and its knockdown impairs ciliogenesis  <cit> . cilia are necessary for hh signaling in vertebrates  <cit> . several hedgehog signaling components are located at cilia in vertebrates, including the patched and smoothened transmembrane proteins  <cit>  and gli transcription factors  <cit> . these observations led to the suggestion that dzip <dig> is involved in regulating the biogenesis of primary cilia and that its role in hh signaling is related to its specific location in this cellular structure. our data do not exclude the possibility that dzip <dig> is present in the basal body of primary cilia, but we found that dzip <dig> was present throughout the cytoplasm and, to a certain extent, in the nuclear compartment. moreover, half of the protein appeared to be immobilized in granular structures, suggesting that this protein is a component of macromolecular complexes. this observation is consistent with the original report by moore et al. , who also observed dzip <dig> in the cytoplasm of germ cells and reported that its translocation to the nucleus was dependent on its pka-regulated phosphorylation  <cit> .

in situ hybridization has shown that the abundance of patched is low in zebrafish dzip <dig> mutants  <cit> . here, qrt-pcr revealed that dzip <dig> knockdown did not affect patched mrna levels in hela cells. this can be explained by the different technique used to reduce the expression of dzip <dig> , because some residual expression will be present after gene knockdown. alternatively, this discrepancy may be due to the different techniques used for the detection of mrnas. wang et al.  showed that cep <dig> protein fails to localize to ciliary appendages in dzip <dig> mutant cells. interestingly, we found that cep <dig> mrna  is regulated by a complex containing dzip <dig> . dzip <dig> regulates both ciliogenesis and the sequestration of gli <dig> in the cytoplasm. these dual functions appear to be independent of each other and unique to dzip <dig>  <cit> . here we propose a third function of dzip <dig> and show that dzip <dig> is present in protein complexes involved in the regulation of mrnas. many aspects of the rna regulon model  <cit>  are reflected in the results presented here. posttranscriptional regulation involves multifunctional proteins, which form ribonucleoprotein complexes that are assembled in a combinatorial manner. a single protein or mrna may, therefore, be involved in several rna regulons. our ribonomic analysis showed that dzip <dig> was associated with a vast subpopulation of mrnas. these transcripts mostly encoded proteins involved in the control of the cell cycle and gene expression. dzip <dig> has recently been identified as a putative tumor suppressor involved in controlling cell proliferation  <cit> . dzip <dig> is also involved in the regulation of hedgehog signaling, a pathway activated in several types of human cancers  <cit> . thus, the stimulation of cell growth that we observed following dzip <dig> knockdown may reflect the derepression of the mrna targets of dzip1-containing regulatory rnp complexes. interestingly, we found that several transcripts involved in the hh response and in the biogenesis of primary cilia were associated with dzip <dig>  various authors have suggested that dzip <dig> plays an essential role in regulating ciliogenesis and is a structural component of the primary cilium  <cit> . we demonstrated that the activation state of the hh signaling pathway determines the abundance of dzip <dig> and its cellular distribution. thus, dzip <dig> may be indirectly involved in the formation of cilia and in hh signaling, by influencing the fate of transcripts encoding various components of the two pathways.

the stability and translation of the identified transcripts also seemed to be unaffected by changes in the abundance of dzip <dig>  however, dzip <dig> was clearly associated with polysomes. rnp complexes can also regulate the fate of target mrnas by determining their distribution in specific foci in the cytoplasm, enhancing their translation or controlling their degradation  <cit> . the granular pattern of dzip <dig> labeling was abolished by blockade of the hh pathway. moreover, dzip <dig> was mobilized to rna stress granules in response to heat or oxidative stress. daz family proteins  have also been reported to be associated with rna granules during the stress response  <cit> . knockdown of dzip <dig> reduced the number of stress granules after oxidative stress. this suggests that dzip <dig> is needed for the assembly of these rna granules though it may be not a core component of them.

according to the rna regulon model, the protein and mrna contents of rnps are dynamic, and vary in response to changing cellular conditions. it would therefore be of interest to determine the protein composition of these rnps and to investigate how the stability, distribution and translation of dzip1-target mrnas change in response to cell stress. in addition, it is still unclear whether dzip <dig> is essential for the formation of stress granules and the proteins that interact with dzip <dig> in various conditions  remain to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that dzip <dig> is part of an rnp complex that occupies various subcellular locations. we propose a model in which dzip <dig> interacts with various rna-binding proteins, and moves from the nucleus through the cytoplasm where it binds to polysomes or storage/degradation complexes. dzip appears to be important for the formation of stress granules during the stress response. the diversity of the mrnas associated with dzip <dig> suggests that this protein is a component of different rnps associated with translating polysomes and with rna granules.
