BACKGROUND
of age-related dementia, the most common form, alzheimer disease  a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, presents a severe economic and social burden worldwide  <cit> . in the rare, familial form of ad   <cit> , genetic mutations in specific proteins, app, ps <dig>  and ps <dig>  cause insoluble amyloid-β peptide  aggregation and elevated levels of neurotoxic, soluble aβ1– <dig> . in sporadic, late-onset ad, the appearance of aβ neuropathology has supported the theory of aβ deposition as the primary causative factor leading to neuronal death  <cit> . this hypothesis has resulted in the dominance in ad in drug discovery of transgenic mouse models that overexpress the mutant human genes linked to familial ad; however, to date, all therapeutics directly targeting aβ production, aggregation, or clearance have failed primary endpoints in phase  <dig> clinical trials .

approximatively, half of the patients diagnosed with dementia, have additional pathologies associated to the hallmarks of aβ and tau, including vascular dementia, and dementia with lewy bodies  <cit> . it is also increasingly recognized that ad and dementia are multifactorial diseases, with contributions to onset and progression including early synaptic failure  <cit> , inflammation  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> , cerebrovascular impairment  <cit> , depletion of neurotrophins  <cit> , and excitotoxicity  <cit> . it is argued that effective treatment should target two or more factors in disease pathogenesis  <cit> . in this context, drug repositioning is also an attractive approach  <cit> . the clinical agent, chlomethiazole , is neuroprotective in animal models  <cit> , with reported amelioration of inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and excitotoxicity . therefore, cmz was proposed as a candidate for combination therapies treating neuronal injury  <cit> . in line with this postulate, we have reported that cmz is neuroprotective in primary neurons treated with neurotoxic, oligomeric aβ1– <dig>   <cit> .

based on the strong a rationale for targeting synaptic dysfunction in ad  <cit> , we sought to modify cmz to incorporate this activity without loss of other attributes. phosphorylation of camp-response element binding protein  is necessary for memory formation and synaptic strengthening and the work of kandel has highlighted a role for nitric oxide induced release of cyclic guanosine  <dig> -monophosphate  in creb activation in the hippocampus . more recently decreased activity of pcreb has been demonstrated in homogenates taken from post-mortem ad patients  <cit> . moreover, dysfunctional creb signaling has been placed at the center of ad-related gene networks  <cit> . accordingly, an analogue of cmz, 4-methyl-5- ethyl) thiazol-3-ium chloride , was engineered to activate no/cgmp/creb signaling and to retain the beneficial activity of cmz.

cmz possesses anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative properties that derive, at least in part, from potentiation of gaba signaling, which has been confirmed by direct study of the actions of cmz on gaba receptors  <cit> . we successfully confirmed the retention of nmz of these proprieties precisely, via potentiation of the α1β2γ <dig> gabaa receptor and through study of sedative actions in vivo. restoration of ltp was designed into the structure of nmz and therefore comparison of nmz and cmz in hippocampal slices from the transgenic app/ps <dig> mouse was used to confirm that the design of nmz did add function over cmz. several agents have been reliably used to induce amnesia in wild type mice, which can be tested using the step-through passive avoidance  task. no/cgmp signaling regulates the strength of synaptic transmission in an activity-dependent manner in the hippocampus and functions in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons  <cit> , therefore nmz was tested using agents that induce amnesia by blockade of cholinergic, glutamatergic, and nitrergic signaling. correlation of pharmacokinetic measurements of brain and plasma concentrations of nmz with pharmacodynamic analysis of cognitive function in the face of scopolamine-induced amnesia were used to define pk/pd relationships.

re-engineering of a neuroprotective agent that addresses multiple mechanisms contributing to neurodegeneration to provide a brain bioavailable small molecule that restores ltp and memory is a novel approach towards treatment of age-related and mixed pathology dementia, including the most common form, ad.

RESULTS
nmz is a gabaa potentiator and shows a sedative effect at higher doses than cmz
the core anticonvulsant, sedative, and anxiolytic properties of cmz derive, at least in part, from gaba potentiation. measurements using the xenopus oocyte model expressing α1β2γ <dig> gabaa receptors confirmed that nmz retained gabaa potentiating activity in vitro . as a measure of sedation, motor impairment was assessed using latency to fall on a rotating rod for c57bl/ <dig> mice . preliminary experiments showed a significant effect of cmz , therefore, this and an equimolar dose of nmz were selected. all animals were trained in the task for 3–5 days prior to experiment, until latency to fall reached 100 ± 10 s. at 10 min post injection, cmz and nmz groups had a latency to fall of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s respectively , showing motor impairment over vehicle treated animals . at 30 min, only cmz showed a significant deficit , versus vehicle , and at 60 min, cmz retained significant sedative actions . to test more profound sedation, loss of righting reflex  was assessed in male c57bl/ <dig> mice . the duration of lorr, defined as failure to place four paws on the ground within 30 s after placing the mouse on its back, was measured every 2 min for 2 h post drug administration. all animals recovered fully after treatment. cmz significantly induced lorr at doses lower than nmz. at the 125 mg/kg dose, nmz induced lorr for  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min, which was not statistically significant; whereas cmz at a molar equivalent dose induced a significant lorr . only at the highest dose  did lorr reach significance for nmz . it is important to note that the dose of nmz needed to induce a transient sedative effect, reflected by lorr, was almost 200-fold higher than the procognitive dose reported below.fig.  <dig> retention of gabaa potentiating, and attenuated sedative activity in nmz relative to cmz. a oocytes expressing the α1β2γ <dig> gabaa receptor  showed a dose response to increasing concentrations of nmz in the presence of gaba . addition of picrotoxin  caused 96 ± 2 % inhibition of the potentiated gaba response  . data show mean ± sd normalized to the saturated 200 µm gaba response. b male c57bl/ <dig> mice  were injected i.p. with cmz  or an equimolar dose of nmz before testing for their latency to fall on a rotating rod . nmz showed less sedation than cmz at various time points. data show mean ± sem. statistical significance relative to vehicle is indicated by *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , using one-way anova with dunnett’s post hoc test. c male c57bl/ <dig> mice  were injected with escalating doses of cmz and nmz and loss of righting reflex  was measured over 2 h. nmz showed less sedation than cmz, and no lorr was observed for nmz until 125 mg/kg. data show mean ± sem. non-zero statistical significance by one-sample t test is indicated by *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 



nmz reverses memory deficits in wt animals by consolidating memory
nmz was designed to add procognitive activity to the neuroprotective actions of cmz, therefore, nmz  was tested in male c57bl/ <dig> mice using the step-through passive avoidance  behavioral task, in which mice learn to associate a mild electric shock  with the dark side of a light–dark box and latency to enter is assessed  <dig> and 48 h after training. a variety of amnestic agents, administered i.p. 30 min before training, have been shown to cause loss of memory without hindering the ability of animals to learn the task. the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine   <cit> , the nmda receptor antagonist mk- <dig> , the benzodiazepine diazepam   <cit> , and the nitric oxide synthase  inhibitor l-name , were able significantly to inhibit memory as reflected by decreased latency in stpa . vehicle treated animals reliably show a latency in testing at or close to the cutoff threshold of 300 s, which was reduced after treatment with amnestic agents. administration of nmz  20 min prior to training restored memory as shown by significantly increased latency . to test the effects of oral drug delivery, animals were treated with nmz  in drinking water for 24 h prior to training, again resulting in reversal of a scopolamine-induced deficit, tested at 24 h , or 48 h post training .fig.  <dig> reversal of induced amnestic deficits by multiple agents in stpa. a male c57bl/ <dig> mice  treated with vehicle or nmz  after being administered with diverse amnestic agents were tested for their latency to enter the dark side of the stpa apparatus at 24 h after training. nmz reversed memory deficits induced by scopolamine , mk- <dig> , diazepam , and l-name . b male c57bl/ <dig> mice with scopolamine-induced deficits treated with nmz showed reversal of latency to enter the dark side of the chamber  <dig> and 48 h after training. statistical significance is indicated by ***p <  <dig>  compared with the respective saline control for each time point, using unpaired t test. c in scopolamine induced deficits, nmz demonstrated reversal of cognitive deficits when administered i.p. between 40 min prior to training  and 90 min after training ; but no significant effect was observed when administered  <dig> or  <dig> prior to training. data show mean ± sem. statistical significance is indicated by *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  compared with the respective saline control for each treatment, using one-way anova with dunnett’s post hoc test



in the stpa task, animals are tested at least 24 h after drug administration, therefore, confounding locomotor drug effects are highly improbable. the task is also suited to correlate pharmacokinetics with pharmacodynamics . using scopolamine-induced amnesia, the time of administration of nmz  was varied from 120 min prior to 90 min post training . nmz was procognitive when administered within 40 min prior to the start of training, while not effective when given earlier . when administered after training, the procognitive effect was significant at least up to 90 min . task acquisition during training did not differ significantly between vehicle and nmz treated animals .

nmz is orally bioavailable in the brain
the loss of procognitive activity when nmz is administered >60 min before training is indicative of drug clearance and a t1/2 < 60 min in mice. the plasma and brain concentrations of nmz and its denitrated metabolite, 5--4-methylthiazole , were measured by lc–ms/ms , since hmz is itself known to have bioactivity in vivo  <cit> . at early time points after bolus injections of nmz at sedating  or procognitive doses , nmz brain concentrations of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  nm were measured, respectively. in stpa, nmz is procognitive when administered 20 min prior to training, but loses activity administered 60 min prior to training: corresponding to brain levels of nmz of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm respectively. however, we also observed that nmz administration prior to training is not required to restore memory, but that nmz functions by consolidating memory when administered after training. the brain concentrations of nmz and hmz 5 h after injection were only  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively. in place of drug delivery in drinking water, drug was delivered in hydrogel that mice readily consume for hydration when drinking water is made unavailable. this delivery method achieves a relatively constant drug concentration throughout the awake-period, simulating an extended release clinical formulation  <cit> . oral administration of nmz  over 24 h, representing a procognitive dose in stpa, resulted in brain concentrations of nmz and hmz of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively. under these conditions, brain and plasma concentrations were not significantly different. taken together, these measurements indicate that the brain concentration of nmz required for memory consolidation after amnestic insult is approximately  <dig> – <dig>  nm. the measured concentration of hmz could be used as a surrogate for the maximum theoretical concentration of no released from nmz, which would be 3–10 nm.fig.  <dig> pharmacokinetics study on male c57bl/ <dig> mice treated with nmz, single dose  or supplied in hydrogel , showing bioavailability in brain and plasma at various time points after initiation of treatment. the estimated t½ for i.p. administration is 10 min



nmz, but not cmz, restores ltp in hippocampal slices from app/ps <dig> mice
in hippocampal slices from 3-month-old male mice, the effect of nmz and cmz on long-term potentiation  was measured in the ca3-ca <dig> pathway. after 15 min of baseline collection, drug  was added to the bath solution for 5 min prior to induction of ltp using three trains of ten theta bursts, and the resulting fepsp were recorded in the ca <dig> area for 120 min. cmz had no significant effect, whereas nmz induced a significant increase in fepsp slope after ltp induction compared to the untreated transgenic, to levels indistinguishable from wt control . nmz perfusion of wt hippocampal slices had no significant effect . it is important to note that nmz treatment had no effect on ltp induced in hippocampal slices from wt mice, but restored ltp in slices from app/ps <dig> mice. this observation is compatible with the ability of nmz to activate no/cgmp/pcreb signaling, when signaling is impaired.fig.  <dig> beneficial effects seen in ltp from nmz treatment in app/ps <dig> mice. a, b ltp was measured in the ca <dig> region of hippocampal sections in 4 month old male app/ps <dig> mice or littermate controls  treated with cmz  or nmz . nmz showed restoration of ltp in app/ps <dig> mice to wt levels, whereas the effects of cmz were not significant. statistical significance was analyzed by two-way anova with repeated measures: wt veh  vs. wt nmz : f =  <dig>  p >  <dig>  no sig.; wt veh vs. app/ps <dig> veh: f =  <dig>  p <  <dig>  sig; app/ps <dig> veh  vs. app/ps <dig> nmz : f =  <dig>  p <  <dig>  sig; wt nmz vs. app/ps <dig> nmz: f =  <dig>  p >  <dig>  no sig



discussion
the amyloid hypothesis, derived from convergence of genetic, cell biological, and pathological studies  <cit> , states that a primary effect of genetic alterations that cause familial ad is alteration of aβ production or clearance in a way that promotes its aggregation and accumulation in the brain. however, it remains unclear precisely what role aβ plays in disease pathogenesis, since aβ accumulation does not correlate well with the extent of neuronal loss or cognitive dysfunction  <cit> . lowering brain aβ levels has remained the primary target for therapeutic intervention in ad; however, the failure of multiple such therapeutic agents to reach primary endpoints in phase  <dig> clinical trials  <cit> , emphasizes the urgent need for new approaches. in a substantial population of dementia patients with ad pathology, the correlation of aβ histopathology with cognitive decline is poor  <cit> , and aβ-specific therapeutics would be expected to fail in this clinical population. other aging-associated diseases, such as vascular lesions and diabetes, are also linked to ad pathogenesis  <cit> . in addition, ad is a multifactorial disease, many contributors to which are common to other dementias and comorbid diseases, for example, glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation  <cit> . neuroprotective agents have been targeted at these and other contributors to neuronal loss and we reasoned that one of these, cmz, would provide a starting point for modest redesign. an anticonvulsant and anxiolytic, cmz was repurposed in phase  <dig> clinical trials as a neuroprotective drug for use in spinal cord injury and ischemic stroke  <cit> , and is prescribed for anxiety and agitation in the elderly  <cit> .

in this context, our redesigned molecule, nmz, was intended to retain the beneficial therapeutic properties of cmz, a positive allosteric modulator of gabaa function, which potentiates the function of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba in the brain  <cit>  and therefore attenuates the glutamate-induced excitotoxic cascade leading to mitochondrial damage and neuronal loss . cmz potentiates gaba and muscimol agonism at the gabaa receptor without evidence for modulation of levels of gaba itself; opens neuronal ca-dependent cl¯ channels enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission; is a direct gabaa receptor agonist at concentrations 100-fold than those required to potentiate gaba function ; is not a ligand for the gabab nor benzodiazepine receptors and; potentiates the actions of glycine on inhibitory neurotransmission  <cit> . nmz was shown to potentiate the actions of gaba at the α1β2γ <dig> gabaa receptor without having direct actions on ion current gated by this receptor. loss and recovery of righting reflex provides a measure of profound, reversible sedation; whereas latency to fall from the accelerating rotarod provides a measure of transient sedation. these tests clearly demonstrated that cmz and nmz both cause transient sedation, but that cmz is significantly more potent. the sedative actions of nmz further support the conclusion that nmz retains the activity of cmz at the gabaa receptor. sedation itself is not directly relevant to the proposed beneficial actions of nmz in dementia and was observed at a dose 200-fold higher than that required to counter memory loss.

selective pharmacological activation of gabaa receptors has been shown to provide neuroprotection against aβ mediated toxicity , and the gaba-potentiating  <cit>  and anti-tnf-α  <cit>  properties of cmz are of clinical utility in ad; nevertheless, we hypothesized that it was essential also to address synaptic dysfunction  <cit> . several studies indicate that restoration of synaptic failure can be achieved through creb activation  <cit> . the coupling of creb activation to no/cgmp signaling in the hippocampus  <cit> , inspired the design of nmz  <cit> . we and others have demonstrated that agents activating no/cgmp/creb can significantly improve ltp and cognitive function in mice and rats  <cit> , including in studies of scopolamine-induced amnesia  <cit> . nmz treatment was able to reverse deficits in working memory in the stpa task induced by blockade of muscarinic and nmda receptors, in addition to deficits induced by diazepam and inhibition of nitric oxide synthase . more importantly, by varying the time of drug administration, we demonstrated that nmz reverses cholinergic deficits administered 90 min after training, functioning via memory consolidation. the cholinergic hypothesis remains relevant to age-related dementia and ad  <cit> .

pk/pd relationships were also obtained for nmz actions on working memory by varying the time of drug administration. administration of nmz i.p. at 1 mg/kg and p.o. at 20 mg/kg/day gave approximate peak and trough brain concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig>  nm, respectively. the loss of procognitive activity corresponded to brain concentrations of nmz falling below 1 nm during training. oral delivery of nmz at 20 mg/kg/day was procognitive and yielded a mean brain concentration of  <dig>  nm. the measured brain/plasma ratio approached unity and the observed sedative activity required concentrations of nmz in brain tissues reaching 10 µm. the high potency of nmz, in vivo, for cognition enhancement  and the large separation of sedative and procognitive actions  is encouraging for clinical efficacy and safety. in accord with predictions for improvement of the function of cmz by incorporating no/cgmp/creb signaling in nmz, perfusion of hippocampal slices from transgenic app/ps <dig> mouse with nmz, but not cmz, rescued ltp in this model of ad.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, nmz, an orally active, brain-bioavailable small molecule represents a novel therapeutic approach to dementia and ad. the re-engineering of a clinical neuroprotective agent, cmz, to address synaptic dysfunction by incorporating the capacity to activate no/cgmp/creb signaling was achieved without loss of the gabaa potentiating actions of the parent drug. the increasing recognition that ad and age-related dementia may have underlying mixed pathology, supports a small molecule systems pharmacology approach to neurodegeneration and dementia.
