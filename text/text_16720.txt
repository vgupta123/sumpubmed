BACKGROUND
the human parasite entamoeba histolytica  is a unicellular protozoal parasite that phylogenetically is placed on one of the lowermost branches of the eukaryotic tree, closest to dictyostelium discoideum  <cit> . it is an unusual organism, having  <dig>  predicted genes, with slightly less than one third  of its predicted proteins having no homologues in genbank  <cit> . humans are its only natural hosts, and e. histolytica is spread by ingestion of contaminated food or water via the fecal-oral route and thus tends to endemically infect people under circumstances where hygiene is poor  <cit> . it has a simple life cycle, alternating between infective quadrinucleate cysts and invasive motile trophozoites  <cit> . 80% of people infected with e. histolytica are colonized asymptomatically; in the remaining 20%, trophozoites invade into the intestinal epithelium, resulting in clinical disease  <cit> . it is estimated that there are  <dig> million symptomatic cases of amebic colitis and  <dig>  deaths per year worldwide due to e. histolytica  <cit> .

the discovery that double-stranded rna  can initiate post-transcriptional sequence-specific gene silencing of cellular genes  <cit>  via translational repression or degradation of mrna in most eukaryotic cells has become an important tool in assessing and manipulating gene function. this mechanism of rna interference  may have evolved as a defense against viruses and transposable elements with dsrna intermediates  <cit> . the small rna intermediates in this process, short interfering rnas , result from dsrna being cleaved at 21- to 23- nucleotide intervals  <cit>  by an rnase iii-type protein, dicer  <cit> , and are then incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex , which includes argonaute "slicer" protein  <cit> . the antisense strand of the sirna is used to guide the risc to its target mrna, which is then cleaved by argonaute  <cit> . rnai effects can be amplified by the action of rna-dependent rna polymerases . sirnas act as primers for rdrps, which form new dsrnas using the target mrna as a template, which are subsequently cleaved into sirnas with sequences corresponding to target mrnas but differing from the original dsrnas  <cit> . genes encoding rdrps have been identified in many organisms, but not in flies or mammals  <cit> .

e. histolytica possesses the molecular machinery for rnai. it has a gene   <cit>  encoding a protein which has a single rnase iii domain and possesses rnase iii activity, and could perform the dicer role as a dimer. it also has two argonaute homologs   <cit>  and an rdrp   <cit> . exploitation of rnai for knockdown of gene expression is an attractive approach for e. histolytica, as there is no evidence for meiotic division or detectable homologous recombination of genes  <cit> , thus it has not been possible to generate gene knockouts  <cit> . multiple copies of the genome, and even nuclei, occur in the parasite due to an apparent lack of the normal cell cycle regulatory checkpoints  <cit> . homologous entamoeba cell-cycle regulation genes are divergent from typical eukaryotic versions and may not have equivalent function  <cit> . this presents difficulties in studying gene function or in isolating recessive mutations  <cit> . the study of the function of individual genes in the past has been limited to other techniques, such as the over-expression of wild-type or mutant genes, and other methods of gene inactivation such as antisense  <cit> . methods of rnai used in e. histolytica have included the use of long dsrna expressed by an e. histolytica rna polymerase ii promoter, which was successfully used to knock down expression of the e. histolytica proteins diaphanous, klp <dig> and ehstirp  <cit> , and the soaking of trophozoites in artificial sirnas to knock down γ-tubulin expression  <cit> . these reports of rnai use in e. histolytica showed knockdown of a single gene or of a gene family. here, we report in this study the success of the method of expression of short hairpin rnas driven by the e. histolytica u <dig> promoter to knock down protein expression in e. histolytica of three unrelated genes.

short hairpin rnas  have a similar structure to sirnas except the sense and antisense strands are connected at one end by a short loop, and function like sirnas to knock down gene expression  <cit> . shrnas can be produced from an expression vector as a single transcript from a rna polymerase iii promoter. the eukaryotic u <dig> promoter offers two advantages over other rna polymerase iii promoters: the promoter region immediately upstream of the transcribed sequence for the u <dig> small nuclear rna gene includes all the required regulatory elements  <cit> , and the termination sequence consists of  <dig> to  <dig> thymidine residues rather than a poly-a tail  <cit> . a variety of shrna loop and stem lengths have been tested, with the loop uucaagaga  <cit>  used in a number of mammalian shrna constructs, including gou et al   <cit> , and is also used in the constructs in this study. longer hairpins with 29-base pair stems appear to be better inhibitors of gene expression than ones with shorter 19– <dig> bp stems  <cit> . increased effectiveness has also been seen for similarly-sized longer artificial sirnas, with only one sirna apparently generated per longer shrna or sirna  <cit> .

genes selected for knockdown: the three genes selected for knockdown in this study, igl, ure3-bp, and ehc2a, are genes involved in amebic virulence under study in our laboratory; they were selected since we wanted to create an additional tool for studying the function and role of these genes in amebic virulence.

igl, the intermediate subunit of the galactose- and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine-  inhibitable lectin  <cit> , is a  <dig> kda protein. the gal/galnac lectin, the major defined amebic adhesin, is a virulence factor mediating adherence to target cells in the first step of contact-dependent cell killing  <cit> . the lectin binds to terminal galactose or galnac residues in glycoproteins on the surfaces of target cells, and is composed of three subunits: the heavy subunit hgl , the intermediate subunit igl, and the light subunit lgl  <cit> . the integral-membrane hgl is disulfide-bonded to the gpi -anchored lgl. igl is also gpi-anchored to the membrane  <cit> . evidence that igl is associated non-covalently with the hgl-lgl heterodimer includes that igl and the hgl-lgl heterodimer co-migrate in native gel electrophoresis, and affinity-purification of igl with monoclonal antibodies results in the co-purification of the hgl-lgl heterodimer  <cit> . igl is encoded by two unlinked gene copies, igl <dig>   <cit>  and igl <dig>   <cit> ;   <cit> , producing ~ <dig> aa proteins that are 81% identical and contain  <dig> cxxc repeats. cxxc repeats are also found in a family of transmembrane kinases of e. histolytica and the giardia lamblia variant-specific surface proteins  <cit> .

ure3-bp, upstream regulatory element 3-binding protein   <cit> , is a  <dig>  kda calcium-regulated transcription factor encoding two ef-hand motifs, which are associated with calcium-binding activity  <cit> . ure3-bp binds to the ure <dig>  consensus motif, tattctatt, found in the promoter of hgl <dig>  which is one of the genes encoding the gal/galnac lectin heavy subunit, and is also present in the ferredoxin  <dig>  promoter, thereby regulating the expression of these genes  <cit> . the human neuronal protein dream  is the only other known example of a calcium-responsive transcription factor with ef hands  <cit> .

ehc2a   <cit>  is a  <dig> kda calcium-binding membrane protein containing a conserved c <dig> domain, is associated with the ability to bind phospholipids, and has a proline-rich c-terminal tail. this protein was found to be associated to the amebic phagosome  <cit> . a c <dig> domain, identified originally in protein kinase c, is a ca2+-binding motif that allows calcium-dependent protein anchoring to or interaction with membranes; these domains are found in a number of signaling proteins in eukaryotes  <cit> .

a gene for which we have previously shown knockdown is patmk, phagosome-associated transmembrane kinase  <dig>   <cit> . patmk is a transmembrane kinase family member found in the early phagosome and is involved in the phagocytosis of human erythrocytes  <cit> . it contains an intracellular putative kinase domain, a short membrane-spanning region, and an ectodomain containing cxxc-repeats like igl  <cit> .

we report here the effectiveness of shrnas in silencing genes in entamoeba histolytica. expression of 29-bp shrnas driven by the e. histolytica u <dig> promoter was successful in knocking down protein expression of the three different and unrelated genes in e. histolytica reported in this study, and we previously showed knockdown for a fourth gene  <cit> . this method of gene knockdown appears to function well for a variety of gene types, and should be a useful tool for studying gene function in this organism.

RESULTS
construction of shrna constructs
the rna polymerase iii promoter of the e. histolytica u <dig> gene   <cit>  was amplified beginning at - <dig> from the transcription start site of the u <dig> small nuclear rna gene, and the shrna-encoding dna was added by pcr at the transcription start site  <cit>  . the resulting u <dig> promoter-shrna constructs were cloned into pgir <dig> modified to contain a short polylinker . the shrnas were designed to have a 29-nucleotide complementary stem with a 9-nucleotide loop . the sense strand sequences of the shrna constructs transfected into hm1:imss trophozoites, the oligonucleotide  sequences used to create them by pcr, and the oligo sequences used in quantitative reverse-transcription real-time pcr  amplification to assess mrna knockdown are shown in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

the ambion sirna finder  <cit>  was used to select  <dig> mers from the entire coding sequence of ure3-bp, the poly-proline region of ehc2a, or the identical or divergent regions of igl <dig> and igl <dig>  which were then checked for sufficient gc content, lengthened to  <dig> nucleotides, and tested for sufficient sequence uniqueness by blasting each  <dig> mer using the e. histolytica genome project database  <cit> . a scrambled sequence was created as a control for ehc2a. a sequence directed against gfp  <cit>  was included as a control for the igl and ure3-bp selections. the constructs are named such that the numbers in parentheses following the gene name indicated the location of the shrna sense strand within that gene sequence.

the sequences shown in table  <dig> were used to design primers for two-step pcr, based on the method used by gou et al   <cit>  and diagrammed in figure 1a. the final pcr product contained the e. histolytica u <dig> promoter with a hindiii site on the 5' end, an apai site at the 3' end of the u <dig> promoter, the 29-nt sense strand of the hairpin, the  <dig> bp loop ttcaagaga, the antisense strand of the hairpin, and the u <dig> terminator sequence followed by a noti restriction site. the forward primer, "u <dig> hindiii forward", contained the hindiii recognition site and the 5' end of the u <dig> promoter, the first reverse primer  contained the sequence of the sense strand of the shrna and the future loop, and the second reverse primer  contained the loop sequence, the antisense strand sequence, and the u <dig> termination sequence. a control gfp sequence  <cit>  was used to design oligos for creating a shrna construct as a transfection control.

oligo pairs were designed to amplify short sections of igl or ure3-bp. for igl, four pairs of oligos were used: one amplifying the 5' end  and one the 3' end  of igl <dig> and igl <dig> simultaneously; and a pair each to amplify a short section unique to igl <dig> or igl <dig>  near the 5' end of the mrna. three oligo pairs were used to amplify short sections of ure3-bp: one pair the 5' end, one pair the middle, and one pair the 3' end. the actin and jacob primers were designed to amplify all family members or alleles  <cit> .

shrna transfectants
transfectants were maintained at  <dig> μg/ml hygromycin. for knockdown studies, the hygromycin concentration was increased every  <dig> hours until the final level of selection was achieved, and was maintained for  <dig> hours, in order to increase the copy number of the episomal shrna vector  <cit> . the level of hygromycin selection was increased until the desired knockdown was attained, up to  <dig> μg/ml. transfected trophozoites selected with  <dig> μg/ml hygromycin continued to grow and divide for at least two weeks under continuous selection. a shrna directed against green fluorescent protein   <cit> , with a sequence matching nothing in the e. histolytica genome, was utilized as a control for transfection and hygromycin selection for the igl and ure3-bp transfectants. gfp shrna transfectants were selected with the same level of hygromycin as other shrna transfectants. for ehc2a, a scrambled control matching nothing in the e. histolytica genome was created, containing the same nucleotides as the ehc2a  shrna, but in a different order. sequences of the shrna sense strands are shown in table  <dig>  non-transfected hm1-imss amebae were also included, with the results for western blotting and qrt-pcr being statistically the same as the gfp controls. three biological replicates were grown per shrna transfectant, and one for the nontransfected hm1:imss amebae. all sample trophozoites were grown in  <dig> cm <dig> tissue culture flasks, and were harvested for crude lysate and for rna isolation on the same day from the same flask. for protein and mrna comparison, actin was used as the "housekeeping" control gene, as a loading and normalization control.

knockdown of igl protein
four igl shrna constructs targeted igl. one construct, igl <dig> , specifically targeted igl <dig>  three constructs, igl , igl , and igl , were targeted to sequences conserved in both igl <dig> and  <dig> . the gfp shrna transfectants were used as controls. transfected trophozoites were selected with  <dig> μg/ml hygromycin for  <dig> hours before harvesting. blots were probed with anti-igl <dig> antibody, and with anti-actin antibody as a loading and normalization control. the level of igl <dig> in the gfp shrna transfectants was defined to be 100% . the igl1-specific  shrna transfectant had a decreased amount of igl <dig> protein,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, as compared to the gfp shrna control . igl  had  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and igl  had  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the gfp control igl <dig> level. the igl  shrna construct had no effect on igl <dig> levels  . hm1:imss nontransfected amebae were not statistically different from the gfp shrna control . the igl  and igl  transfectants, when selected with  <dig> μg/ml hygromycin rather than  <dig> μg/ml, yielded less knockdown, having ~70% and ~65% of the control level of igl <dig> .

the average level of igl <dig> protein in the gfp control shrna transfectants was defined as 100% expression of igl <dig> protein for computational purposes. protein levels of igl <dig>  using actin as a standard for comparison, were quantified from western blotting. values are expressed as the percentage of the gfp level ± se, with the p-value following each, calculated using student's t test. for western blotting, there were three biological replicates, each run in triplicate sets of serial dilutions , with the exception of the hm1:imss nontransfected samples having one biological replicate rather than three. protein levels were not statistically different between the igl <dig> , igl , and igl  samples  or the gfp, hm1:imss, and igl  samples . a representative western blot is shown in figure  <dig> 

knockdown of igl mrna
short sections of igl were amplified via qrt-pcr using template cdnas synthesized from the igl and control gfp shrna transfectant mrnas. four oligo pairs were used to amplify igl. two sets of oligos targeted both igl <dig> and igl <dig> simultaneously, with one pair amplifying a 5' section and the other a 3' section conserved in both igl <dig> and igl <dig>  the two others were specific for igl <dig> or igl <dig>  targeting a non-conserved region. the oligo sequences and regions of igl transcript amplification are shown in table  <dig>  and summarized qrt-pcr data for igl is shown in table  <dig>  all samples were compared to the gfp control shrna transfectants. three of the four igl shrna transfectants showed knockdown of igl transcripts for all sets of oligo pairs, ranging between ~ <dig> and ~80% of the igl level in the gfp shrna control . igl  shrna transfectants did not show any knockdown, and the hm1:imss nontransfected trophozoites were not statistically different from the gfp shrna control .

for qrt-pcr, samples were amplified with the actin oligo pair as a control, or with four pairs of igl oligos: igl 5', amplifying the 5' end of both igl <dig> and igl <dig>  igl 3', amplifying both igl <dig> and igl <dig> at the 3' end, and oligos specific for igl <dig> and igl <dig> individually, amplifying igl1- or igl2-specific sequences near the 5' end. oligo sequences are shown in table  <dig>  three biological replicates were each assayed in quadruplicate sets with each oligo pair, with the exception of the hm1:imss samples, which had one biological replicate. igl and actin levels were calculated by using both the relative standard curve and the ΔΔc method  <cit>  and actin was used as the normalization control. the average level of igl in the gfp control shrna transfectants was defined as 100% expression of igl mrna for computational purposes. igl levels in the igl transfectant samples and nontransfected hm1:imss were compared to the gfp control, and are shown as the percentage of igl mrna relative to the gfp control . statistical analysis was performed using student's t test , groups were compared using anova, and the graphpad quickcalcs p-value calculator  <cit>  was used to calculate p-values.

knockdown of ure3-bp protein
two shrna constructs were used to target ure3-bp: ure3-bp  and ure3-bp . transfected trophozoites were selected with  <dig> μg/ml hygromycin  shrna) or  <dig> μg/ml hygromycin  shrna) for  <dig> hours before harvesting. actin was used as a normalization and loading control. there was significant reduction of ure3-bp protein in both ure3-bp shrna transfectants: for ure3-bp  it was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for ure3-bp  as compared to the gfp shrna control . hm1:imss samples were also included, but were not statistically different from the gfp shrna control .

the average level of ure3-bp protein was defined as being 100% in the gfp shrna control transfectants. the levels of ure3-bp and the actin standard were quantified from western blotting. values are expressed as the percentage of ure3-bp protein or mrna of the gfp control shrna transfectant level ± se, with the p-value following each. there were three biological replicates for all samples, each run in triplicate plus serial dilutions , except for hm1:imss nontransfectants, which had one biological replicate run in triplicate plus serial dilutions. all samples were normalized to actin, and compared to the gfp control using student's t test. ure3-bp protein levels are not statistically different between the ure3-bp  and  samples  or between the gfp and hm1:imss nontransfected samples . a representative western blot is shown in figure  <dig> 

knockdown of ure3-bp mrna
three different oligo pairs, one amplifying the 5' end of ure3-bp, one the 3' end, and one a section in the middle, were used in qrt-pcr to amplify ure3-bp in cdna from gfp shrna control transfectants, ure3-bp  and ure3-bp  shrna transfectants, and hm1:imss nontransfected trophozoites. oligo sequences are shown in table  <dig>  actin was used as the normalization control. the ure3-bp  shrna transfectant had an average of about 69% of the gfp control ure3-bp transcript level, and the ure3-bp  shrna transfectant had about 13% of the of the gfp shrna control ure3-bp level .

the average ure3-bp transcript level as measured by qrt-pcr and normalized to actin was defined as being 100% in the gfp shrna control transfectants. hm1:imss nontransfected amebae were also included. three different oligo pairs amplifying the 5', middle, and 3' sections of ure3-bp were used . student's t test was used for statistical analysis. three biological replicates were each assayed in quadruplicate with each oligo pair, with the exception of the hm1:imss samples, which had one biological replicate. values are expressed as the percentage of ure3-bp mrna of the gfp control shrna transfectant level ± se, with the p-value following each.

knockdown of ehc2a protein
two shrna constructs targeted ehc2a, ehc2a  and ehc2a . transfectants were selected with  <dig> μg/ml hygromycin for  <dig> hours before harvesting. the scrambled control ehc2a  shrna transfectant was used as a control for ehc2a protein levels. hm1:imss nontransfected amebae were not included. the level of ehc2a protein in the ehc2a  control shrna transfectant was defined as  <dig> ±  <dig> % . the ehc2a  shrna transfectant yielded a knockdown of ehc2a protein to a level of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . the ehc2a  shrna transfectant had no knockdown effect on ehc2a levels  and was statistically the same  as the ehc2a  shrna control transfectant . student's t test was used for statistical analysis. qrt-pcr was not performed for these samples.

northern blots of small rnas
since the e. histolytica u <dig> promoter had never been characterized, we tested if shrnas or other small rnas were being produced by the u <dig> promoter. the patmk samples were included because they had been shown to have significant knockdown of patmk protein levels as compared to the scrambled patmk shrna control transfectant  <cit> , and therefore would be good candidates for expressing the shrnas. northern blotting of the patmk  <cit>  and igl shrna transfectant small rnas was performed. transfected trophozoites were selected with  <dig> μg/ml hygromycin for  <dig> hours before harvesting, since we had seen protein knockdown previously at that level of selection  <cit> . non-transfected hm1:imss amebae were included as a negative control. fifty μg of small rnas from patmk shrna transfectants  <cit>  and the igl shrna transfectants were probed with oligo probes targeting the respective sense and antisense strands of the shrnas . the patmk   <cit>  and igl  shrna samples had substantial expression of ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> nucleotide small rnas, the expected sizes for the unprocessed hairpin and the processed sirna respectively. there was not a correlation of the small rna abundance with the degree of protein knockdown, as the small rnas were more abundant in igl  than in igl , yet both had similar degrees of knockdown.

discussion
we have utilized the u <dig> promoter to drive expression of shrnas with a 29-bp stem and a 9-nt loop to knock down protein expression of three unrelated genes: a membrane protein, igl, the intermediate subunit of the gal/galnac lectin; ure3-bp, a calcium-regulated transcription factor, upstream regulatory element 3- binding protein; and ehc2a, a membrane-binding protein. previously we had reported preliminary experience with this system in the near-complete knockdown of phagosome-associated transmembrane kinase  <dig>   <cit> . in the work reported here, the highest level of protein knockdown for igl was 72%, for ure3-bp 89%, and for ehc2a 97%. we concluded that this was a reliable and effective system for gene knockdown in e. histolytica. this method has advantages over other methods used for gene silencing: the u6-shrna expression cassettes are small , appear to be active against different types of genes, yield significant knockdown, and the expression vector, once transfected, allows continuous expression of shrnas, thus avoiding performing multiple transfections, and the shrnas can be easily synthesized via pcr.

not every transfected shrna construct was equally effective in silencing gene expression. for example, neither the ehc2a  nor the igl  shrna construct blocked gene expression. in the case of igl , the run of four thymidines at positions 19– <dig> in the shrna sense strand could possibly cause rna polymerase iii to terminate the transcript prematurely. in the case of the ehc2a  shrna construct, the shrna could bind to two locations in the mrna, both the originally targeted region , but also about  <dig> nt upstream , and perhaps this had an inhibitory effect on the ability of this shrna to allow knockdown.

factors other than the shrna sequence affect the ability of a shrna to down-regulate gene expression. the secondary structure of the transcript affects the ability of the risc to bind to its target site  <cit> , and the relative abundance and stability of an mrna may play a significant role in determining whether a given shrna will effectively lead to the degradation of its target message. in addition, the stability of a protein product may also be a determinant in the detection of a knockdown phenotype. the protein with the least knockdown in these studies, igl, was the most abundant; ehc2a was the least abundant and had the most knockdown  <cit> . the level of hygromycin utilized to select for transfectants was an important determinant of the extent of protein knockdown. igl knockdown was twice as effective with  <dig> μg/ml as with  <dig> μg/ml of hygromycin selection.

the qrt-pcr data was not correlated directly with the level of protein knockdown. for the igl transfectants, the mrna knockdown level was not as high as the protein knockdown level, indicating the possibility that the protein could have a high turnover rate or be somewhat unstable. for ure3-bp, the ure3-bp  and  transfectants had similar levels of protein knockdown; however, the mrna levels in the ure3-bp  transfectants were higher , versus the ure3-bp  transfectants . this difference is probably not due to partial mrna decay, since the qrt-pcr data showed consistent ure3-bp levels among the three oligo pairs amplifying the 5', middle, and 3' sections of the transcript. one possible explanation could be that the secondary structure of the ure3-bp mrna at the location of the ure3-bp  shrna could interfere sufficiently with the risc being able to cleave the mrna but still allow risc binding, allowing for a degree of translational inhibition in addition to some mrna destruction.

the e. histolytica u <dig> promoter appears to be functional and producing shrnas: the northern blots of the small rnas detected two sizes of small rnas when probed with oligos that were complementary to the individual sense and antisense strands of the shrnas. these may represent the unprocessed hairpin and the resulting sirnas after dicer processing. surprisingly, the abundance of the small rna was not proportional to the level of silencing. northern blots may not be sensitive enough to identify low-level small rna production, with low-level production adequate for protein knockdown.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the knockdown of three genes in this study: igl, the intermediate subunit of the gal/galnac lectin; the calcium-responsive transcription factor ure3-bp; the membrane-binding protein ehc2a, by transfecting e. histolytica with expression vectors using the e. histolytica u <dig> promoter to drive expression of shrnas targeting endogenous genes. we have previously reported the knockdown of transmembrane kinase patmk  <cit> . these genes come from different families, with different functions, so this shrna knockdown method appears robust and not specific to only one gene or gene family.
