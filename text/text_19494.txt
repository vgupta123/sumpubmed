BACKGROUND
the inhibitor of dna-binding  proteins, id1- <dig>  are negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factors. they lack the basic domain necessary for dna-binding. by forming dna-binding incompetent heterodimers with bhlh factors they inhibit transcription of target genes. various cellular processes are regulated by individual id-proteins: inhibition of cellular differentiation by interference with differentiation-specific bhlh and non-bhlh transcription factors  <cit> , extension of cellular life span  <cit> , regulation of angiogenesis  <cit>  as well as cardiac development  <cit>  and maintenance of the embryonic stem cell phenotype  <cit> . id expression is deregulated in many tumors, including cervical cancer  <cit> , melanoma  <cit> , pancreatic cancer  <cit> , squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus  <cit>  and in thyroid cancer  <cit> . in some tumors id-expression is associated with poor clinical prognosis, e.g. in ovarian cancer, in cervical cancer, in prostate cancer, and in breast cancer  <cit> . taken together, these data imply an oncogenic role for id proteins.

ectopic expression of id <dig> rapidly leads to the accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes in primary human keratinocytes  <cit> , induction of tetraploidy in telomerase-immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cells  <cit> , and induction of chromosomal instability through deregulation of apc/cdh <dig> in prostate epithelial cells  <cit> . a fraction of id <dig>  but not of the other id proteins, is localized at centrosomal structures. id <dig> is the only id family member that shows a clear association with normal and supernumerary centrosomes throughout the cell cycle  <cit> . no centrosomal localization can be detected for id2- <dig>  irrespective of the cell cycle or centrosome duplication status of the cell . proposed mechanisms of how id <dig> can induce centrosomal changes are deregulation of the centrosomal proteasome  <cit>  and stabilization of aurora kinase a  <cit> . centrosomes are the microtubule organizing centers  of the cell and consist of two centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material containing different coiled-coil proteins, e.g. pericentrin and ninein  <cit> . centrosome duplication is a critical event during mitosis, as it must only happen once to ensure the formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle and equal segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. duplication is initiated at the g1-s-phase transition and is controlled by cdk2-cyclin e/a activity  <cit> . furthermore, phosphorylation of prb seems to be necessary followed by the activity of e2f transcription factors  <cit> . centrosome abnormalities are found in neurodegenerative processes as well as in autoimmune diseases, but most frequently they are observed in human malignancies . in normal cells centrosome defects lead to g <dig> arrest of the cell via p <dig> activation  <cit> . tumor cells with mutated p <dig> lack this mechanism and can still undergo mitosis and thereby accumulate centrosome defects  <cit> . furthermore, various cellular and viral oncogenes can induce centrosome abnormalities independent of p <dig>  <cit> . supernumerary centrosomes lead to the formation of abnormal multipolar mitoses and may ultimately induce aneuploidy  <cit> .

here, we analyzed endogenous id expression levels in various  cell lines. by assessing the number of centrosomes we show here that high endogenous id <dig> expression, but not that of the other id proteins, is associated with a higher rate of abnormal centrosomes. this lends further support to the hypothesis that id <dig> interferes with centrosomal function and can promote a more aggressive tumor phenotype.

RESULTS
ectopic expression of id <dig> in primary human cells results in accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes in these cells  <cit> . high expression levels of the id-proteins have been observed in various proliferating tissue types  <cit> . as there are several, partly contradictory reports about the expression levels of the four id-proteins in primary tumor cells and cell lines, we analyzed  <dig> established  cell lines for endogenous id protein expression levels in proliferating cells.

id proteins are differentially expressed in tumor cell lines
protein expression levels of the four id-proteins were analyzed in proliferating cells using standard western blotting technique. cell cycle analysis confirmed similar cell cycle distribution of the different cell lines . id protein expression was normalized to gapdh-expression. expression of id <dig> was readily detectable in all cervical cancer cell lines, in hacat, in the colon cancer line hct- <dig> as well as in jurkat  . intermediate expression of id <dig> could be detected in the remaining leukemic cell lines and in two breast cancer cell lines, t47-d and mda-mb <dig>  whereas mcf- <dig> and mda-mb <dig> only showed very low id <dig> expression. id <dig> protein expression could be detected in most cell lines . only caski, a cervical cancer cell line, h- <dig> , and the osteosarcoma cell line u2os did not express id <dig> in remarkable levels. in contrast higher id <dig> expression was only detectable in a small number of cells, i.e. in jurkat, hacat, hela, and c33a cells . id <dig> protein was undetectable in all examined cell lines  confirming earlier reports that id <dig> is mainly expressed in neural tissues  <cit> .

id-mrna expression does not correlate with protein expression
to compare mrna expression of the id proteins with protein expression, quantitative real time pcr  was performed on selected cell lines using id-specific primer pairs. we observed different id mrna expression patterns as compared to id protein expression patterns . id <dig> mrna expression could be detected at similar levels in all cell lines . id <dig> mrna expression was readily detectable in all cell lines. here, only jurkat seemed to express lower levels of id <dig> mrna, which is in contrast to the relatively high id <dig> protein expression in these cells . id <dig> mrna expression correlated with the id <dig> protein expression levels in all cell lines but hct- <dig>  where the highest mrna-expression but low protein expression of id <dig> was seen . most cell lines analyzed showed undetectable id <dig> mrna levels, a finding correlating with non-detectable id <dig> protein expression in these cells. surprisingly, hacat cells express high levels of id <dig> mrna, which did not translate into higher id <dig> protein levels .

analysis of centrosome number
to address the question whether endogenous id <dig> can contribute to accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes, as has been reported for ectopic id <dig> expression, the number of centrosomes was determined using immunofluorescence microscopy. a monoclonal antibody against Î³-tubulin, a component of the pericentriolar matrix was used to visualize centrosomes. only cells with one nucleus were analyzed and n >  <dig> centrosomes per cells were counted as having supernumerary centrosomes. we know from previous experiments that the rate of abnormal centrosomes is approximately 2% in human foreskin keratinocytes. therefore we assumed a rate of centrosomal abnormalities of > 2% as aberrant.

analysis of centrosome number in leukemic cells showed the highest percentage of cells with aberrant centrosomes in jurkat, followed by hl- <dig> and u <dig>  kazumi cells had the lowest percentage of supernumerary centrosomes . all cervical cancer cells showed a higher percentage of aberrant centrosomes, ranging from  <dig> %  to 11%  . breast cancer cells showed similar centrosome abnormalities with exception of t47-d . the other tested cell lines showed very heterogeneous centrosome numbers . the highest numbers of abnormal centrosomes  were detected in jurkat, t 47-d, c33a and hela cells . an intermediate frequency could be observed in hacat, caski and hct- <dig> with  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of supernumerary centrosomes. the remaining cell lines showed a lower number of abnormal centrosomes ranging from  <dig> %  in mda-mb <dig> to  <dig> %  in kasumi- <dig> cells . higher id <dig> expression correlated with more pronounced centrosomal colocalization . centrosome number did not influence the rate of mono- or multipolar mitoses . the group of david pellman recently proposed a direct mechanism by which supernumerary centrosome could induce chromosomal instability: using long-term live-cell imaging ganem and colleagues could demonstrate that cells with multiple centrosomes rarely undergo multipolar cell divisions, but routinely undergo bipolar cell divisions. furthermore, the authors could convincingly show that extra centrosomes alone are sufficient to promote chromosome missegregation during bipolar cell division, and propose this to be the mechanism and the common underlying cause of cin in human cancer  <cit> .

cell lines are lined up starting with highest rate of centrosomal abnormalities. +: high expression; : intermediate expression; -: low expression or not detectable.

high id <dig> expression correlates with increased centrosomal abnormalities
we have previously reported accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes in cells ectopically expressing id <dig>  <cit> . no influence of id <dig>  id <dig> or id <dig> was detected then. our findings here were very suggestive that endogenous id <dig> expression might also influence centrosomal homeostasis in various cancer cell lines. comparison of id <dig> expression and the number of centrosomal abnormalities showed a clear and significant correlation of high id1-expression with an increased number of centrosome abnormalities  . surprisingly, not only id <dig> expression but also id <dig> expression correlated with centrosome abnormalities , whereas id <dig> and id <dig> did not. similarly, colocalization of id <dig> with centrosomes  was more obvious in leukemic cells expressing higher levels of endogenous id <dig> .

taken together, elevated endogenous id <dig> expression, as seen in diverse cancer cell lines, is associated with an increased number of centrosome abnormalities. furthermore we have shown here that all id proteins, except id <dig>  are expressed in cancer cell lines and that protein expression does not strictly correlate with mrna expression, most likely due to post-translational modifications and/or id protein stability and dynamics. our findings confirm a role of id proteins in the regulation of centrosome duplication and raise the question of how protein expression of the id-proteins beyond transcription is regulated.

discussion
although it has been reported that ectopic expression of id <dig> but not id2- <dig> leads to rapid induction of cells with supernumerary centrosomes  <cit>  one cannot rule out that this is due to the experimental conditions. we therefore analyzed id expression in different cell types using immunoblot and real time pcr to correlate endogenous id expression with centrosome abnormalities. apart from id <dig>  which showed a uniform expression pattern in breast cancer and leukemic cells, we did not detect a clear tissue specific expression pattern of the ids. id <dig> is induced in the course of normal granulopoesis  <cit> . id <dig> can also be induced by myc through direct promoter activation  <cit> . both leukemic cell lines, hl- <dig> and u <dig>  express myc at high levels, which might explain high id <dig> expression in these cells  <cit> . in addition, id <dig> can be induced by hif- <dig> and hif- <dig> , which might contribute to id <dig> expression in breast cancer cells  <cit> .

id <dig> protein was expressed in a minority of cells, and id <dig> protein expression was undetectable in all cell lines analyzed, confirming earlier results  <cit> . whether id <dig> positively influences tumor growth is still not completely understood. recent studies revealed that the id <dig> gene can be silenced through promoter hypermethylation in various tumors  <cit> , suggesting a tumor suppressive role. on the other hand id <dig> was identified as an upstream regulator of brca <dig> in breast and ovarian cancer, and more aggressive breast cancer types showed higher id <dig> expression  <cit> . additionally, activating translocations of id <dig> have been detected in some patients and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia  <cit> .

id <dig> protein expression was readily detectable in most of the cell lines analyzed. expression was independent of cell cycle distribution or underlying mutations. since cells were cultured simultaneously under the same conditions, differential induction of id <dig> by growth factors from the culture medium is also unlikely. other factors e.g. proteasomal degradation, rna stability, micrornas, posttranscriptional and posttranslational modifications, or gene amplification might regulate id <dig> expression. the observed differences between id protein and mrna expression imply that id mrna or proteins are altered soon after transcription or after translation. id <dig>  id <dig> and id <dig> are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome complex while id <dig> seems to be eliminated through other pathways  <cit> . the half-life of id proteins, namely id <dig> and id <dig> is relatively short, depending on the cell type and cell cycle status. it ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes  <cit> . additionally the biological activity of id <dig> and id <dig> can be altered by phosphorylation, which occurs in late g <dig> and alters the binding specificity and the stability of these id proteins  <cit> . by altering the proteasome activity or by accelerating ubiquitination id protein degradation could be promoted  <cit> . intracellular mirnas or sirnas might trigger id mrna degradation or inhibit translation. thus, to measure biological activity of the ids and to further analyze their role in tumor development, protein expression should be determined rather than mrna expression.

we show here that elevated endogenous id <dig> expression levels correlate with the accumulation of abnormal centrosomes. interestingly, a statistical correlation between id <dig> expression and id <dig> expression and therefore between id <dig> and centrosomal abnormalities was found, which might be due to co-regulation of id <dig> and id <dig>  <cit> . centrosome duplication is orchestrated by cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and their inhibitors  <cit> , and loss of the latter results in centriole over duplication  <cit> . as id proteins influence members of the cyclin-inhibiting cip and kip factors, e.g. p21waf1/cip <dig> and p27kip <dig>  one might assume that id <dig> induces centrosome abnormalities by inhibiting p21waf1/cip <dig>  this seems unlikely, as only ectopic expression of id <dig> leads to centrosomal abnormalities, whereas all id proteins regulate p21waf1/cip <dig> promoter activity  <cit> . other oncogenes such as myc can induce centrosomal abnormalities  <cit> . the high-risk human papilloma virus  e <dig> and e <dig> oncoproteins lead to genomic instability and induce abnormal centrosomes  <cit> . cervical cancer is most often caused by infection with high-risk hpv  <cit> . all cervical cancer cell lines analyzed showed high levels of abnormal centrosomes. interestingly, the highest rate of supernumerary centrosomes was detected in c33a cells, which are hpv negative. therefore, another mechanism must contribute to accumulation of abnormal centrosomes in these cells, e.g. high expression levels of id <dig> 

one mechanism that id <dig> can deregulate centrosome duplication is by regulating the activity of the centrosomal proteasome. this is in part mediated through interaction of id <dig> with s5a, a subunit of the 26s proteasome. id <dig> and s5a are both located at centrosomal structures. ectopic expression of s5a normalizes id1-induced centrosome abnormalities, and depletion of s5a leads to a similar accumulation of supernumerary centrosomes without tetraploidization  <cit> . development of centrosomal alterations and cell aneuploidy has been linked to overexpression of the centrosomal kinase aurora a  <cit> . indeed, it has been shown that id <dig> overexpression may lead to stabilization of aurora a by interaction with the anaphase-promoting complex coactivator cdh <dig>  <cit> . thus, high levels of id <dig> may interact with cdh <dig> to stabilize aurora-a and induce supernumerary centrosomes. the interactions between aurora kinases and id <dig> require further functional in vitro analyses. aurora-a is differentially regulated and expressed in chromosomal and microsatellite instable colorectal carcinomas and the observed high id <dig> expression may contribute to this  <cit> . recent efforts of therapeutic intervention with small molecule inhibitors of aurora kinase are ongoing, and the data presented here may provide additional information about the potential therapeutic mechanisms  <cit> .

we did not observe a correlation between aneuploidy and increased abnormal centrosomes. nearly all cell lines analyzed had aneuploid karyotypes  but not all of them are characterized by high levels of centrosome abnormalities. even the rate of aneuploidy does not seem to influence the frequency of abnormal centrosomes as mcf- <dig> and mda-mb <dig> reveal only slightly elevated levels of abnormal centrosomes accompanying aneuploidy. altered p <dig> function contributes to impaired centrosome function. only four of the cell lines used  have wild type p <dig>  whereas all other cell lines harbor a mutated or inactivated p <dig> gene . we failed to see an influence of p <dig> status on steady state centrosome numbers. as previously shown, id <dig> appears to act independent of p <dig> as it is able to induce centrosomal abnormalities in p <dig> deficient as well as in p <dig> positive cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together we show here that not only ectopic but also endogenous id <dig> expression can deregulate centrosome duplication, further supporting an oncogenic role for this id protein. this is in so far of importance, as most knowledge about the function of id proteins comes from overexpression experiments, in which non-physiologically high expression levels were used to achieve biological effects. furthermore, when evaluating id expression in tumors and cell lines, protein levels should be analyzed and correlated with mrna expression. our results might imply that protein expression of the ids is more complex than previously thought and that protein expression and not mrna-expression should be the main focus of further expression analysis in primary tumors.
