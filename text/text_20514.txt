BACKGROUND
chromatin in the eukaryotic cell nucleus is organized into sub-regions of various transcriptional activities. chromatin insulators, also known as boundary elements, are a unique class of functional elements in eukaryotic genomes. they are thought to separate differently regulated sub-regions along chromatin fibers. deletion of an insulator can cause abnormal expression of local genes resulting in developmental defects. for example, deletion of the fab- <dig> insulator in bithorax complex of drosophila melanogaster results in body segment transformation  <cit> .

chromatin insulators interfere with promoter-enhancer interactions only when they are positioned between a promoter and the enhancer. the gypsy insulator of drosophila melanogaster is one of the best characterized insulators. insertion of a copy of the gypsy insulator sequence in a gene or its regulatory region interferes with interactions between local enhancers and the promoter thus causing mutant phenotypes in many genes  <cit> . the gypsy insulator is a  <dig> to  <dig> base pair sequence containing  <dig> or  <dig> copies of a consensus repeat sequence, some of which bind the suppressor of hairy-wing  zinc finger protein, which is required for insulator activity  <cit> .

su organizes a protein complex on the gypsy insulator. identified proteins in the complex include su, the centrosomal protein  <dig> , modifier of mdg  <dig>  <dig>  , and several other proteins  <cit> . the cp <dig> protein is essential for gypsy insulator function too  <cit>  and is present in other types of chromatin insulator complexes such as the ctcf complex which mediates the insulator activity at the fab- <dig> insulator in the bithorax complex  <cit> , and the beaf <dig> complex  <cit> .

cp <dig> has three conserved protein motifs:  the broad-complex, tramtrack and bric-abrac  homologous domain, also know as the poxvirus and zinc finger  domain;  three copies of c2h <dig> zinc fingers; and  the c-terminal e-rich domain. in addition to these three domains, previous studies identified a centrosomal targeting domain  for localizing the cp <dig> protein to centrosomes during mitosis  <cit> . to understand the roles of these domains in insulator function, we used genetic complementation using p-element transgenes expressing domain-truncated cp <dig> mutants. we identified an additional acidic d-rich region which is involved in the association of cp <dig> with insulator complexes. we found that the btb domain, the d-rich region and an acidic c-terminal e-rich region are essential to the function of cp <dig> in the gypsy insulator. the zinc fingers and the centrosomal targeting domain are dispensable. our results indicate that the three essential domains have distinct roles in insulator binding and function.

RESULTS
cp <dig> domain-truncated mutants
to determine functional domains essential for the function of cp <dig> in the gypsy chromatin insulator, we performed genetic complementation with p-element transgenes carrying cp <dig> mutants, each lacking a predicted functional domain . since cp <dig> is expressed ubiquitously in cells of all examined tissues in all developmental stages and that cp <dig> mutations were rescued by a cp <dig> cdna driven by the ubiquitin ubi63e promoter  <cit> , we expressed cp <dig> proteins using the p-element vectors containing the ubiquitin ubi63e promoter  <cit> . each p-element transgene contains a full-length or a mutated cp <dig> cdna fragment fused to either the green fluorescent protein , the red fluorescent protein  or a 6x-myc tag . the molecular tags allow detection of the transgenic fusion proteins by anti-tag antibodies or by gfp or rfp fluorescence. at least two independent insertions of each p-element were crossed into homozygous cp <dig> mutant backgrounds. these include cp <dig> nucleotide substitution  that causes a translation stop at q <dig> and is homozygous lethal in the pupal stage  <cit> , and cp190h4- <dig>  a viable mutant encoding the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . homozygous cp <dig> larvae do not express detectable amounts of the predicted truncated protein and thus are essentially null mutants. in addition to the transgenes, we also included the cp190en <dig>  which is not a transgene but an ethyl methanesulfonate  generated mutant, in this series of domain-truncation analysis. cp190en <dig> is a point mutation  that causes a stop codon after the amino acid residue  <dig> . the cp190en <dig> mutant expresses a truncated protein marked as cp190dct in figure  <dig>  which lacks the whole c-terminal e-rich region and two of the zinc fingers .

the cp <dig> btb domain, but not the zinc finger or centrosomal targeting  domains, is required for viability and insulator activity
expression of engineered cp <dig> truncations were examined by immunoblots using lysates from homozygous cp <dig> flies carrying the transgenes at larval stages  or pupal stages  using anti-cp <dig>  or anti-gfp immunoblots . similar results were obtained from both larvae and pupae. the expected truncated proteins were expressed at levels similar to, or higher than, the wild-type cp <dig>  smaller degraded fragments were noticeable in cp190Δm, gfp-cp190dznf and mrfp-cp <dig> transgenic lines.

we next determined if the transgenes rescue the lethality of homozygous cp <dig>  expression of mrfp-cp <dig> encoded by p, or gfp-cp190dznf lacking all three zinc fingers encoded by p, fully rescued the lethality of homozygous cp <dig>  the rescued adults were healthy and fertile, showing that the gfp-cp190dznf and the mrfp-cp <dig> proteins support all essential cp <dig> functions. we confirmed the published result that the cp190Δm transgene which lacks the centrosomal-targeting cent region  rescues lethality of the homozygous cp <dig> mutant  <cit> .

the zinc finger and centrosomal targeting domains are also not required for gypsy insulator activity. the insulator function was evaluated using two gypsy insertion mutations that cause adult phenotypes: the cut wing phenotype of the ct <dig> mutation  and the body cuticle pigmentation phenotype of the y <dig> mutation. ct <dig> wing margins lack bristle cells . the ct <dig> margin phenotype is suppressed in a cp190-deficient background. for example, in the homozygous viable cp190h4- <dig> flies, some margin bristles appear between veins l <dig> and l <dig> and wings are rounder in shape , indicating that the gypsy insulator activity is partially reduced. most cp1903/cp190p <dig> flies die as pupae, but a few adult escapers  have wings with wild-type appearance , indicating greatly reduced insulator activity. a copy of mrfp-cp <dig>  gfp-cp190dznf or the cp190Δm transgenes restored the gypsy insulator function in the homozygous cp <dig>  which cause substantial wing margin loss .

in contrast, the btb domain of cp <dig> is required for viability and insulator activity. neither the myc-tagged myc-cp190dbtb encoded by p, nor the gfp-tagged gfp-cp190dbtb encoded by p, rescue the lethality of homozygous cp <dig> although they were expressed at substantial levels . to evaluate if the myc- or gfp-cp190dbtb transgenes rescue the defective gyspy insulator function, the transgenes were crossed into the homozygous viable cp190h4- <dig> background or the cp1903/cp190p <dig> background which gives a few escaper adults. in both the cp190h4- <dig> and cp1903/cp190p <dig> mutants, adults containing the gfp- or myc-tagged cp190dbtb transgenes have the same y <dig> and ct <dig> phenotypes as the mutant without the transgenes , indicating that the btb domain is required for insulator activity.

the btb, but not the zinc finger or cent domains, is essential for association of cp <dig> with the su-mod <dig>  insulator complex
the y locus at the tip of the x chromosome contains a gypsy insertion in y <dig> flies. proteins in the su insulator complex including su, mod <dig>  and cp <dig> can be detected at the y locus in y <dig> flies by immunostaining of salivary gland polytene chromosomes  <cit> . we used immunostaining of y <dig> polytene chromosomes to assay association between the mutated cp <dig> proteins and the su complex. we found that both the gfp-cp190dznf and the cp190Δm proteins bind to the y locus , indicating that the cent domain and the zinc fingers are not required for association of cp <dig> with the gypsy insulator, consistent with the genetic complementation results which show that these domains are not essential for gypsy chromatin insulator activity. in contrast the myc-cp190dbtb protein was no longer present at the gypsy site in the y locus , indicating that the association of the myc-cp190dbtb protein with the su complex at the gypsy insulator is weak or non-existent.

in addition, we noticed that the myc-cp190dbtb protein still associated with many sites on chromosomes although it was absent from the su complex at gypsy, suggesting that other regions in cp <dig> may mediate binding to other types of chromosome-associated complexes. we compared the distribution of the gfp-cp190dbtb and the mrfp-cp <dig> proteins in living cells of salivary glands dissected from 3rd instar larvae. the fully functional mrfp-cp <dig> is associated with polytene chromosomes as multiple bands in the cell nucleus, but is not detectable in extra-chromosomal spaces . although significant amounts of the gfp-cp190dbtb protein were detected on polytene chromosomes and colocalized with the mrfp-cp <dig> , it had a more diffuse pattern and could be detected extra-chromosomally . this result is consistent with the immunostaining result of polytene chromosomes which shows that cp190dbtb still associates with polytene chromosomes at many sites.

the polytene staining results described above indicate that the cp190dbtb protein does not associate with the su-mod <dig>  complex at gypsy, which is supported by immunoprecipitation assays. we showed previously that proteins in the su complex, such as su and mod <dig> , co-precipitated with cp <dig>  <cit> . we precipitated the myc-cp190dbtb protein with anti-myc from extracts of the y <dig> w ct6;p/+; cp1903/tm6b, tb pupae  and detected very weak signals of co-precipitated mod <dig> , in contrast to precipitation of wildtype cp <dig> . the anti-myc and anti-cp <dig> immunoprecipitation reactions were specific since neither cp <dig> nor mod <dig>  were precipitated from the y <dig> w ct <dig> pupae with anti-myc  or with pre-immune serum . the results indicate that association of the myc-cp190dbtb with the mod <dig> -containing complex is significantly weaker than wild-type cp <dig> 

role of btb domain in the association of cp <dig> with multiple types of cp190-containing insulator complexes
cp <dig> associates with diverse insulators including su, ctcf and beaf <dig>  <cit> . to more closely investigate the role of the btb domain in association between cp <dig> and the three types of cp190-containing insulator complexes, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays . we tested su-associated gypsy loci, 1a <dig> and 62d  <cit> , ctcf-associated fab- <dig>  ctcf <dig>  ctcf <dig>  ctcf <dig>  bxc <dig> and bxc <dig> loci  <cit> , and beaf32a- or beaf32b-associated scs', beaf-a <dig>  beaf-a <dig>  beaf-ab <dig>  beaf-b <dig>  beaf-b <dig> and beaf-b <dig> loci  <cit> . we included a site in chromosome locus 1a <dig> as a negative control  <cit> . signals from all loci were normalized to the signal of fab- <dig> to reveal the relative strength of association of cp <dig> with tested sites in comparison with the association of cp <dig> with the fab- <dig> region. the results indicate that cp <dig> associates with su complexes at gypsy, 1a <dig> and 62d, but not with the 1a <dig> negative control region . cp <dig> also associates with ctcf sites at fab- <dig>  ctcf <dig>  bxc <dig>  bxc <dig>  but not at ctcf <dig> and ctcf <dig> . cp <dig> binds to beaf <dig> sites at scs', a <dig>  and b <dig>  but not at a <dig>  ab <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> . association with the tested regions is specific and we did not detect these sites in chip samples precipitated with pre-immune serum .

we next determined the binding of the myc-cp190dbtb at the cp190-positive sites and the negative control 1a <dig> site. the signal of myc-cp190dbtb at fab- <dig> is significantly higher than the 1a <dig> negative control region, suggesting that substantial amounts of the myc-cp190dbtb protein lacking the btb domain still associates with the fab- <dig> region . the signal of fab- <dig> is weaker than those of bxc <dig>  scs', beaf-a <dig> and beaf-b <dig>  since the signal of the wild-type cp <dig> at fab- <dig> is stronger than the signals at bxc <dig>  scs', beaf-a <dig> and beaf-b <dig>  the results indicate that the btb domain contributes partially to the association of cp <dig> with fab- <dig>  although the domain is not critical for the association.

in contrast to the ctcf and beaf <dig> sites, signals of the three tested su sites  are significantly weaker than the signal at fab- <dig>  and are indistinguishable with the negative control region 1a <dig>  suggesting that the btb domain is critical for association of cp <dig> with the su complexes at these loci, consistent with the results of co-ip experiments and the polytene chromosome staining experiments.

the cp190dbtb protein lacking the btb domain does not associate with the su complex. we thus tested if the btb domain is sufficient to associate with insulators. we generated flies carrying the p which encodes the fusion protein containing the gfp and the btb domain of cp <dig> fused to the nuclear localization signal of the drosophila transformer protein  . distribution of this gfp-tagged cp <dig> mutant protein in the cell nucleus is significantly different from that of the mrfp-cp <dig>  first, the gfp-cp190btb-nls protein localizes to extra-chromosomal spaces but the mrfp-cp <dig> does not . second, the gfp-cp190btb-nls is not present at most of the strong mrfp-cp <dig> bands on polytene chromosomes in the cell nucleus . third, we could not detect signals of the gfp-cp190btb-nls protein, stained by the anti-gfp antibody, on the polytene chromosomes spreads . these results suggest that the btb domain alone is not sufficient to associate with the su insulator complexes.

the btb domain and an aspartic acid-rich  region of cp <dig> are sufficient for association with gypsy, ctcf and beaf <dig> sites
the predicted protein of cp190en <dig>  labeled as cp190dct , contains the btb and cent  domains, but lacks two of the three zinc fingers and the c-terminal e-rich domain. genetic tests indicate that the cp190dct protein cannot support insulator activity. loss-of-function cp <dig> mutations dominantly enhance the effects of the homozygous modt <dig> mutation on gypsy-dependent phenotypes  <cit> . the cp190en <dig> allele was obtained in a newly conducted genetic screen of ems-mutagenized flies for dominant enhancers of modt <dig>  the cp190en <dig> mutation dominantly enhances y <dig>  ombp1-d <dig>  and ct <dig> all three gypsy-dependent phenotypes in cp190en15/+; modt <dig> flies, indicating that the gypsy insulator function is reduced . homozygous cp190en <dig> is pupal lethal, but we found four halfway eclosed cp190en15/cp190p <dig> adults that survived for some  <dig> hours without significant locomotion after removal from the pupal case. the cuticle color of these y <dig> w ct6; cp190en15/cp190p <dig> adults was darker than the y <dig> w ct <dig> flies  and the wings had fully developed margins , indicating that the gypsy insulator was non-functional.

although the gypsy insulator is non-functional in cp190en <dig> flies, the cp190dc protein is still present at gypsy insulators. cp190dc binds polytene chromosomes  and colocalizes with the su protein at the y locus in y <dig> mutants . cp190dc also co-localizes with su and mod <dig>  proteins in diploid cells . in contrast, the cp190dc protein is no longer present at the y locus of the y <dig> polytene chromosome in the mod mutant . this result supports the idea that the interaction between the btb domains of cp <dig> and mod <dig>  contributes to the binding of cp <dig> with the su insulator complex. btb domains often mediate dimers with other btb-containing proteins, and thus we posit that the cp <dig> btb domain interacts with the mod <dig>  btb domain and that mod <dig>  recruits cp <dig> lacking the c-terminal e-rich domain.

chip assays with homozygous cp190en <dig> pupae indicate that cp190dc associates with all sites that bind wild-type cp <dig> , because the signals of all tested sites were significantly higher than the 1a <dig> negative control region. the signals at 1a <dig> and 62d were stronger than fab- <dig>  whereas in the wild-type cp <dig> chip results the signals at 1a <dig> and 62d were weaker than fab- <dig> . the result suggests that the c-terminal e-rich domain contributes partially to the association of cp <dig> with the ctcf complexes at fab- <dig> 

the cp190dc protein associates with all cp190-containing insulator complexes but the gfp-cp190btb-nls does not. we thus reasoned that another part of the cp <dig> protein in addition to the btb domain must also be essential for the association. we noticed that there is a d-rich acidic region between the zinc fingers and the btb domain. this d-rich region is in the cp190dc protein, but not in the gfp-cp190btb-nls protein . we generated flies carrying the p which encodes a cp <dig> fragment containing both the btb and the d-rich domain . gfp-cp190btb-d protein localizes to polytene chromosomes as distinct bands and not to extra-chromosomal spaces in living salivary glands . in addition, this gfp-fusion protein co-localized completely with the mrfp-cp <dig> on polytene chromosomes . in diploid larval cells, e.g. brain cells and imaginal disc cells, the gfp-cp190-btb-d protein exists as speckles and co-localizes with mrfp-cp <dig> . these results indicate that this n-terminal cp <dig> fragment is sufficient to associate with most of the cp190-containing insulator complexes in living cells.

although it associates with all cp <dig> sites, gfp-cp190btb-d, like the cp190dc, is not functional in the insulator complexes and lacks essential cp <dig> functions. y <dig> w ct6; p/+; cp190h4- <dig> flies have the same y <dig> body cuticle pigmentation and ct <dig> wing shape phenotypes as the y <dig> w ct6; pcp190h4- <dig> flies . the gfp-cp190-btb-d transgene also does not rescue the lethality of homozygous cp <dig>  from at least  <dig> f <dig> offspring flies of the y <dig> w ct6; p/+; cp1903/tm6b, tb parents, we obtained no cp <dig> homozygous adults.

the mrfp-cp <dig> redistributed to extra-chromosomal spaces during heat-shock whereas the cp190btb-d fragment remained associated
the heat shock response in the drosophila melanogaster has been intensively-studied. when fruit flies are stressed with heat, the transcription of most of the normal genes in cells is shut off and newly synthesized rna species correspond to a small number of heat-induced genes  <cit> . the phenomenon of global changes in transcription is correlated with increased phosphorylation of the histone h <dig> serine  <dig>  at the heat-induced loci and with a sharp decrease of the global level of h3s <dig> phosphorylation at other loci  <cit> . we hypothesized that the global changes of transcription may involve changes in chromatin insulators at a global level. we thus monitored the distribution of mrfp-cp <dig> and gfp-cp190btb-d proteins in cells of the salivary gland after heat-shock. we found that after  <dig> minutes of heat shock at 37°c, significant amounts of mrfp-cp <dig> localized to the extra-chromosomal space , although association of the protein with chromosomes was still obvious. after  <dig> minutes of heat shock, the mrfp-cp <dig> signals were mostly diffused and the protein was clearly present at extra-chromosomal spaces . the result indicates that the heat treatment induced dissociation of the cp <dig> protein from the originally bound insulator sites on chromosomes. on the other hand, we did not detect significant changes of the distribution of the gfp-cp190btb-d protein which remained bound to polytene chromosomes as sharp bands and was not detectable in the extra-chromosomal spaces .

to determine if cp <dig> tightly associates with chromosome without heat-shock treatment, we analyzed the exchange rates of gfp-cp190btb-d and mrfp-cp190mrfp using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  technique. we did not detect significant recovery of both gfp-cp190btb-d and mrfp-cp <dig> signals in the bleached area two minutes after photobleaching, indicating that no significant exchanges of the two cp <dig> proteins within two minutes on chromosomes .

in the cells heat-shocked for  <dig> minutes, we detected signals of extra-chromosomal mrfp-cp <dig> . the signals were significantly weaker in the bleached area right after photobleaching , indicating that the extra-chromosomal signals were not background and were real signals representing the mrfp-cp <dig> molecules which were not associated with chromosomes. the result is consistent with the conclusion above that cp <dig> may dissociate from chromosomes in response to a heat-shock treatment.

in contrast with the non-heat-shocked cells, we detected significant recovery of mrfp-cp <dig> signals in the bleached area within  <dig> minutes , indicating that a fraction of the mrfp-cp <dig> rapidly moved into the bleached area. the result indicates that the heat-shocked cells contained a fraction of fast-moving mrfp-cp <dig> which was not present in cells before the heat treatment.

the redistributed mrfp-cp <dig> molecules in the bleached area were either in extra-chromosomal space where cp <dig> may move more freely or were associated with chromosomes during the recovering period. it is noticeable that the distribution pattern of the recovered signals in the bleached area was different from the pattern before photobleaching . in most of the bleached area, the signals that reappeared lacked distinct bands. these signals might represent mrfp-cp <dig> in extra-chromosomal space. however, a few bands reappeared at locations overlapping with bands that existed before photobleaching , implying that the mrfp-cp <dig> may be exchanged at a higher rate at these locations on chromosomes. all evidence from the heat-shock treatment indicates that a mechanism exists for regulating the association/dissociation of cp <dig> with chromosomes. in contrast with the mrfp-cp <dig>  the gfp-cp190btb-d protein in the heat-shocked gland cells remained bound to chromosomes tightly. we didn't detect significant recovery of the gfp-cp190btb-d signal in the bleach area  <dig> minutes after photobleaching. this result is similar to the non-heat-shocked cells , suggesting that the cp190btb-d lacking the c-terminal e-rich domain of cp <dig> is incapable of responding to the heat-shock treatment and thus remained associating with chromosomes.

discussion
the btb domain of cp <dig> has multiple essential roles for fly development in addition to the association of cp <dig> with the su complex
multiple lines of evidence indicate that the btb domain is required for association of cp <dig> with the su insulator complex:  the cp190dbtb protein which lacks the btb domain does not associate with the gypsy insulator sequence in chip assays and does not localize to the gypsy site on polytene chromosomes;  proteins in the su complex are not co-precipitated with myc-cp190dbtb, but are co-precipitated with wild-type cp <dig>  lack of association between the cp190dbtb protein and the su complex at the gypsy insulators in a cp <dig> mutant may result in defective functionality of the insulator which is also supported by the genetic complementation result that expression of the protein does not rescue the defective gypsy insulator activity in homozygous cp <dig> mutants. it is likely that the btb domain interacts with the btb domain of mod <dig>  because mod <dig>  lacking the btb domain fails to interact with cp <dig> in two-hybrid assays and is not functional in vivo  <cit> .

in addition to the critical role in the association of cp <dig> with the su complex, the btb domain of cp <dig> must have other essential roles for viability of flies. this is because the homozygous su null is female sterile, however cp <dig> flies expressing the gfp-cp190dbtb or myc-cp190dbtb proteins are still inviable, indicating that the cp190dbtb proteins are unable to support at least one function for viability in other cp190-containing complexes. both the polytene staining results and chip assays from myc-cp190dbtb indicate that the btb domain is not essential for association with the ctcf or beaf <dig> complexes, but quantitatively contributes to the association with these complexes. thus either the ctcf or beaf <dig> complexes containing the myc-cp190dbtb are defective in function or the btb domain is involved in an activity essential for fly survival but unrelated to the three types of insulators.

the e-rich domain contributes quantitatively to the association of cp <dig> with all three types of insulator complexes and is essential for cp190's functions
the c-terminal e-rich region is not necessary for the association of cp <dig> with all three types of insulator complexes, because the cp190dct fragment that lacks the whole e-rich region localizes to all the tested cp <dig> wild-type containing su, ctcf and beaf sites in chip assays. this conclusion is well supported by the complete co-localization of the gfp-cp190btb-d fragment with the mrfp-cp <dig> full-length protein on polytene chromosomes in the living salivary gland cell nucleus. the e-rich domain however may still contribute to the association of cp <dig> with the su complex since the cp <dig> wild-type protein still associates with the su complex in the modu <dig> mutant  <cit> , but the cp190dc fragment lacking the e-rich region does not. the interaction between the e-rich region and the su protein may stabilize cp <dig> in the su insulator complex, although the interaction is not essential for association. more importantly, the e-rich domain is required for the essential function of cp <dig> because the homozygous cp190en <dig> fly is lethal and the p transgene does not rescue the lethality of the homozygous cp <dig> mutant. it is likely that the e-rich domain is required by all the cp190-containing insulator complexes.

the dissociation of cp <dig> with chromosomes is a regulated process and requires the function of the e-rich domain
chip-chip results from several groups published recently showed that not all su complexes, ctcf complexes or beaf <dig> complexes contain cp <dig>  <cit> . we also found that some tested chromatic regions containing ctcf complexes or beaf <dig> complexes which were not associated with significant amounts of cp <dig>  this phenomenon argues that the recruitment of cp <dig> to each individual insulator site may be regulated. this view is supported by the dynamic distribution of cp <dig> during heat-shock. significant amounts of mrfp-cp <dig> may dissociate from bound sites and localize to the extra-chromosomal space, implying that a mechanism exists for regulating the association/dissociation of cp <dig> with chromosomes.

cp <dig> binds tightly to chromosomes when flies were cultured in normal temperature. we didn't detect significant exchange of either the full-size cp <dig> protein or the cp190btb-d fragment on chromosomes. in cells treated with heat-shock, the full-size cp <dig> protein dissociated from chromosomes and redistributed into the extra-chromosomal space. this indicates that dissociation of cp <dig> is a regulated process. in the same heat-shocked cells, cp190btb-d which lacks the c-terminal part of cp <dig> was still tightly bound to chromosomes while the full-size cp <dig> dissociated. this phenomenon strongly suggests that the c-terminal part of cp <dig> must be essential for the dissociation. a possible mechanism for this phenomenon is that modifications to the c-terminal part of cp <dig>  for example phosphorylation, would weaken the interaction between cp <dig> and other proteins in insulator complexes. genetic evidence indicates that insulator complexes without cp <dig> are not functional. dissociation of cp <dig> therefore may down-regulate activities of insulators thus affecting the expression of local genes. further characterization of the interactions will be necessary to understand the molecular mechanism through which cp <dig> is recruited differently to the insulator complexes at different genetic locations. however since relatively less information about the composition of the ctcf and the beaf <dig> complexes is known, more detailed analysis of the molecular interactions will require identification of more components in the two types of chromatin insulator complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined sub-regions of the cp <dig> protein required for fly survival, for association with cp190-containing insulators and for the gypsy insulator activity. the n-terminal cp190btb-d fragment of cp <dig> containing the btb domain and the d-rich acidic region is sufficient for association with chromosomes. the fragment however is insufficient for insulator activity and for fly survival during development. the middle portion of the cp <dig> protein, including the cent domain which mediates centrosomal localization and the zinc finger domain, is dispensable for critical insulator functions. the c-terminal e-rich acidic region strengthens association of cp <dig> with most insulator sites and is essential for cp190's insulator function.

we have shown evidence that dissociation of cp <dig> from its bound sites on chromosomes is a regulated process. cp <dig> dissociated from chromosomes when cells were treated with heat-shock. in contrast, the cp190btb-d lacking the e-rich domain did not dissociate from chromosomes during heat-shock, indicating that the e-rich region is required for this dissociation process. previous findings have demonstrated that the function of chromatin insulators requires association of cp <dig> with insulator sites. our results provide a mechanism through which the activities of cp190-containing chromatin insulators may be regulated.
