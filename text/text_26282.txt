BACKGROUND
peanut  is one of the most important crops in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. peanut is used as both human and animal food, being a valuable source of protein and oil  <cit> . the genus arachis  is native to south america and contains  <dig> described species assembled into nine taxonomical sections, according to their morphology, geographic distribution and sexual compatibility  <cit> . the arachis section includes the species that can be crossed to a. hypogaea and encompasses  <dig> diploid species and the tetraploid species a. hypogaea and a. monticola  <cit> .

cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid  with two genome types, a and b, which are found separately in the wild species of the arachis section. the a-genome species are diploids characterized by the presence of a so-called a chromosome pair  <cit> , of reduced size and with a lower level of euchromatin condensation in comparison to the other chromosomes  <cit> . diploid species of the section arachis with 2n =  <dig> and lacking the a chromosome pair are usually considered to share the b-type genome, although they are much more heterogeneous and may present variant forms of this b-genome. one species, a. glandulifera, revealed very poor homologies with all a and b genome taxa, and is considered to have a d genome  <cit> . three other species show 2n =  <dig> chromosomes  <cit>  and their genomic affinities are not clear.

arachis hypogaea was originated via hybridization of two diploid wild species, probably a. duranensis  and a. ipaënsis , followed by a rare spontaneous duplication of chromosomes  <cit> . the resulting tetraploid plant would have been reproductively isolated from its wild diploid relatives. this isolation, coupled with the origin through a probably single hybridization event  <cit> , leads to a limited genetic diversity of peanut, as observed in different studies using molecular markers  <cit> . in contrast, wild diploid arachis species are genetically more diverse  <cit> , providing a rich source of variation for agronomical traits, and dna polymorphisms for genetic and genomic studies  <cit> .

as a consequence, most of the linkage maps developed for arachis included wild species as progenitors, the exception being the a. hypogaea map that has been recently published  <cit> . these maps are based on rflp  <cit> , rapd  <cit> , and more recently, microsatellite markers  <cit> . in this latter study  <cit>  we used a diploid population from a cross between a. duranensis and the closely related a. stenosperma, both having a-type genomes, the former being the most probable a genome donor to cultivated peanut. this map, which essentially provides genetic information for half the genetic component of a. hypogaea, has more recently been updated with new microsatellites, rgas, aflps, and single-copy gene-based markers  .

microsatellite markers are the ideal markers for the development of linkage maps, as they are multiallelic, highly polymorphic, typically co-dominant, and pcr-based markers. additionally, they can often be transferred between different populations and even related species  <cit> . therefore different maps constructed with common microsatellite markers can be aligned, allowing information from the different maps to be accumulated, helping to confirm linkage orders and providing information on the genome evolution of related species.

the aim of this study was to create a linkage map for the arachis b-genome to complement the previously published a-genome map and effectively to provide a linkage map for tetraploid peanut in two separate diploid components. for that, we made an f <dig> population from a cross between the most probable b-genome donor of cultivated peanut, a. ipaënsis  <cit> , and the very closely related a. magna. in order to facilitate map comparisons we used the same set of microsatellite markers used for the construction of the a-genome map, with the addition of some recently published markers,  <dig> newly developed microsatellite,  <dig> est-sts markers and  <dig> strategically chosen anchor markers, which are single copy genic markers that are ideal for the alignment of genomes  <cit> .

RESULTS
interspecific hybridization
several crossings between a. ipaënsis and a. magna were made. seven plants of a. ipaënsis  and six of a. magna  were used as female parents . a total of  <dig> flowers were cross-pollinated, of which  <dig> and  <dig> had a. ipaënsis and a. magna as female parents, respectively. a total of  <dig> viable seeds were obtained, being  <dig>  from a. ipaënsis × a. magna crosses and  <dig>  from a. magna × a. ipaënsis crosses. hybrids were identified using the ssr marker ah- <dig> visualized in 3% agarose gels. the number of seeds obtained from the  <dig> self-pollinated f <dig> individuals was high, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  the f <dig> plant obtained from cross  <dig> , which produced the highest number of seeds  was selected to generate the f <dig> mapping population.

marker development and analysis

a total of  <dig> genomic ssr markers  were tested against a. ipaënsis  and a. magna . of these,  <dig>  were polymorphic ;  <dig>  were monomorphic, and  <dig>  did not amplify any interpretable fragment .

est-ssr markers
out of the  <dig> unique sequences obtained from the two a. hypogaea cdna libraries enriched for expressed genes in response to cercosporidium personatum  <cit> ,  <dig>  presented ssrs with more than five repeats and  <dig> primer pairs could be designed . frequencies of the ssr repeat types are shown in table  <dig>  di- and trinucleotides were the most abundant repeats. out of the  <dig> primer pairs screened against both progenitors, nine  were polymorphic,  <dig>  were monomorphic, six  did not produced any amplification, and five  resulted in low intensity or multiple-band patterns, and were excluded from the analyses . the homologies between the sequences and genes are shown in additional file  <dig> 

of the  <dig> est-ssr markers screened against a. ipaënsis and a. magna , only  <dig>  did not amplify any product. a total of  <dig> est-ssr markers  were polymorphic,  <dig>  were monomorphic, and  <dig>  were excluded due to poor or confusing amplification patterns .

est-sts markers
nineteen primer pairs were designed from ests with homologies to plant genes involved in defense processes against biotic stress . of these, two detected polymorphism against both progenitors, ten were monomorphic, one did not amplify any product, and six resulted in low intensity or multiple band patterns, and were excluded from the analyses .

snp markers
ten anchor markers and one microsatellite distributed in six linkage groups of the aa map  <cit>  were selected for mapping in the bb population. these selected markers were size monomorphic between the mapping parents as judged by electrophoresis in 4% polyacrylamide gel. the pcr products were sequenced and snps were identified for the  <dig> markers. in average, one snp was identified per  <dig> bp, ranging from one snp for every  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. these markers were separated in two multiplex groups of five/six markers each and analyzed in the parents, the f <dig> hybrid and the f <dig> population.

genetic mapping
a total of  <dig> ssr markers were evaluated, of which  <dig>  were polymorphic between the parents. using a minimum lod score of  <dig>  and a maximum recombination fraction of  <dig> ,  <dig> markers mapped into  <dig> linkage groups. these markers included  <dig> genomic ssrs,  <dig> est-ssrs, two est-sts, and nine anchor markers. the map covered a total distance of  <dig> . <dig> cm . groups ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. linkage groups were numbered according to the lg numbers of the aa genome map  <cit>  by the identification of syntenic markers. two ssr primer pairs amplified consistently two loci  and these markers were identified by the numbers _ <dig> and _ <dig> after the marker names . thirty-two markers  out of the  <dig> mapped markers showed deviation from the expected 1:2: <dig> ratio, being  <dig> at p <  <dig>  and eight at p <  <dig> . of these,  <dig> markers were skewed towards a. magna, three markers towards a. ipaënsis, and  <dig> towards the heterozygote. linkage groups b <dig> and b <dig> had all distorted markers with an excess of a. magna alleles, while lgs b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> had all distorted markers skewed towards the heterozygote. the three markers with an excess of a. ipaënsis alleles grouped on lgs b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> that also had markers with an excess of a. magna alleles and towards the heterozygote. distorted markers at p <  <dig>  were identified by # . groups b <dig> and b <dig> had no distorted markers.

synteny analysis
a total of  <dig> common markers mapped in the aa and bb genome diploid maps spanned the  <dig> linkage groups of both maps . seven lgs of the bb map  showed direct correspondences with seven groups of the aa map. of these, five had all common markers mapped in the same order. from two  to  <dig>  collinear loci were identified per linkage group. the groups b <dig> and b <dig> showed common loci to group a <dig>  and two segmental inversions were apparent . group b <dig> was syntenic to the upper region of lg a <dig> with five collinear loci, and the group b <dig> in the lower region. inversions were also detected in the lgs b1/a <dig> and b6/a <dig>  linkage groups b <dig> and b <dig> showed split syntenic relationships, with common markers mapping in two lg of the aa map, b <dig> with a <dig> and a <dig>  and b <dig> with a <dig> and a <dig> 

discussion
this linkage map was obtained using an f <dig> population derived from a cross between a. ipaënsis and a. magna. several lines of evidence indicate that a. ipaënsis is the most probable donor of the b-genome to a. hypogaea  <cit> . arachis magna is also a b-genome species closely related to a. ipaënsis, as indicated by crossability data  <cit> , high rates of pollen viability in hybrids  <cit> , and molecular marker analyses  <cit> . the high fertility of the crosses and low polymorphism levels between the species  observed here support this close relationship, and indeed even suggest that the two names could actually correspond to a single biological species. further studies should be carried out to check this hypothesis, as it might have important implications for the incorporation of new wild alleles in cultivated peanut: so far there are many collected accessions of a. magna and only one available accession of a. ipaënsis. however, regardless the taxonomic status of the species, it is clear that both genomes used to construct the map are similar to the b-genome of a. hypogaea and that the linkage map is probably a good representation of it.

the dna polymorphism within this population is lower than the populations used for the construction of previously published arachis maps: 51% for rflp probes in the a. stenosperma × a. cardenasii derived population  <cit> ; 40% for rflp probes in the arachis hypogaea × synthetic amphidiploid {a. batizocoi × }4× population  <cit> ; and 47% for ssr markers in the a. duranensis × a. stenosperma derived population  <cit> . this low polymorphism has been compensated by the large number of ssr markers developed for arachis over the past few years  <cit> , which has enabled the development of this linkage map. on the other hand, the segregation distortion of  <dig> % is in the same range as the distortion found in many intraspecific maps  <cit> . linkage groups b <dig> and b <dig> had all distorted markers with an excess of a. magna alleles, while lg b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> had all distorted markers skewed towards the heterozygote. these groupings of distorted markers suggest that some regions of the chromosome are more prone to segregation distortion, rather than the distortion being marker-specific.

all markers evaluated in this study were amplified using heterologous primers. most of them were developed for a. hypogaea and a. stenosperma, and  <dig> markers were developed for species from other sections of the arachis genus , confirming the high transferability of ssr markers within the arachis genus. from  <dig> markers tested,  <dig>  allowed the amplification of pcr products in a. ipaënsis and/or a. magna. as expected, the level of transferability varied among the different types of primers tested. microsatellites based on expressed genic regions  showed higher transferability levels  than random genomic microsatellites . this confirms previous findings that markers based on cdna sequences are more transferable among species than random markers, such as genomic ssrs, since they are based on coding regions, which are generally more conserved that non coding regions  <cit> .

the number of repeats found in the genomic microsatellite markers was, in general, higher  than the number in expressed genic microsatellites . this difference was not reflected in the polymorphism levels found for these two sources of primers:  <dig> % of the est-ssrs and  <dig> % of the genomic ssrs. these findings are in agreement with our previous results for wild species and contrasts with cultivated peanut, where longer microsatellites have higher polymorphism  <cit> .

the present map comprised  <dig> linkage groups, with  <dig> loci spanning a total map distance of  <dig> . <dig> cm, which corresponds to the haploid chromosome number of the progenitor species n =  <dig>  <cit> . the total length obtained is similar to the sizes described for the other two co-dominant marker-based linkage maps published for diploid species of arachis:  <dig>  cm for an rflp based map developed using an a. stenosperma × a. cardenasii cross  <cit>  and  <dig> . <dig> cm found for a microsatellite based map developed using an a. duranensis × a. stenosperma cross  <cit> . this size is also comparable to half of the  <dig> . <dig> cm found for a published tetraploid map for arachis spp.  <cit> . however, seventeen  of the  <dig> segregating markers remained unlinked, suggesting that at least parts of the genome have not been covered by this map.

twenty five percent of the mapped markers were developed from cdna libraries . some of them had similarity to genes of known function, including genes involved in the photosynthesis process and in responses to biotic stresses. for instance, marker ahbgsd1002h <dig>  showed similarity to a tissue specific gene coding for a prolin-rich protein of soybean , that has the expression induced by salicylic acid, virus infection, circadian rhythm and salinic and drought stresses, indicating this gene may have an important role in the response to multiple internal and external factors  <cit> . marker ahbgst1002b <dig> showed similarity to dihiydro-isoflavone redutase , that is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of different flavonoids, and some of them, such as flavones and the 3-deoxyanthocyanidina, are involved in the plant defense process  <cit> . linkage maps that contain genic markers can facilitate the finding of genes of interest, as ests mapping in regions with qtls are good candidates to be involved in the trait and being an alternative to positional cloning  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> microsatellite markers in common with the a-genome map  <cit>  were placed on this b-genome map. in order to increase the number of shared markers, nine anchor markers  <cit>  selected from the a-map  <cit>  were placed on the b-map using snps. the comparison of the  <dig> shared markers revealed associations between maps and apparently high levels of synteny, since all but one of the b linkage groups show single main correspondences to the a-map. this seems largely consistent with the observed for homeologous groups in the published tetraploid map of arachis  <cit>  with perhaps the main differences being: in the tetraploid study, one large b linkage group shows no marker correspondences to the a genome, whilst in this study no "orphan" linkage groups are present; and in this study two b linkage groups correspond to one a , a situation not observed in the tetraploid map.

the integration of the a- and b-genome arachis maps effectively increases the information content of both maps. the a-genome map contains candidate genes and qtls for disease resistance, and has been aligned with the genomes of the model legumes lotus and medicago and with the bean genetic map  <cit> . much of this information is likely to be transferable to the b-map. as an example, figure  <dig> shows an alignment of the b-map through the a-map with lotus, whose genome sequence was recently published  <cit> . this type of alignment allows the inference of the position of candidate genes from a whole genome sequence on the b-genome map.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present a microsatellite-based map for the b-genome of arachis and its integration with an a-genome map. the development of these maps, based on markers that are highly transferable and simple to use will facilitate the identification and introgression of useful genes from both a-type and b-type wild genomes into cultivated peanut. these maps will also be used as reference for future cultivated peanut maps and for the development of introgression lines which are underway. both the b-genome population described here and the a-genome population  <cit> , have now been developed into f <dig> ril  populations which will facilitate the even broader use of these map and marker resources.
