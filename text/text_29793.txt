BACKGROUND
the immune system has developed in a stepwise manner by progressive sophistication of basic functions that helped ancestral organisms to survive in their hostile environment. recognition of pathogens in a species-specific way results in the generation of a very robust mode of surveillance system in plants. this form of protection termed resistance  protein-mediated or effector-triggered immunity is induced when a plant encoded r protein "perceives" the presence of a pathogen-derived effector molecule, represented by specific avirulence  gene products  <cit> . following recognition of the pathogen, one or more signal transduction pathways are induced in the host plant and these lead to the prevention of colonization by the pathogen.

the majority of characterized r proteins encode a nucleotide-binding site  and leucine-rich repeats . nb-lrr-encoding genes make up one of the largest and most variable gene families found in plants, with most plant genomes containing several hundred family members  <cit> . the n-terminal ends of r-proteins are predominantly composed of a tir  homologous domain or form a coiled-coil  motif. monocots in particular, have numerous cc-nb-lrr proteins in their genomes. accumulating data suggest furthermore that n termini of r-proteins may interact with a range of pathogen-derived proteins. however, the lrr domain may determine the final outcome of this recognition, leading to downstream signaling and initiation of defense responses  <cit> .

many r-genes are located in clusters that either comprise several copies of homologous sequences arising from a single gene family or co-localized r-gene sequences derived from unrelated gene families  <cit> . this genomic make-up assists multiple proteins to become modified via various genic and intergenic processes enabling rapid evolution and adaptation to changes in a pathogen genome  <cit> . r-genes can also act in pairs  <cit> . the r-gene pairs can differ in genomic location and protein domain structure but also to their interaction with different pathogen isolates.

the heterothallic ascomycete setosphaeria turcica  leonard & suggs  causes turcicum or northern leaf blight disease on maize. this fungal pathogen also attacks sorghum and related grass species, for example johnson grass  <cit> . turcicum leaf blight is one of the most prevalent foliar diseases in most maize-growing regions of the world. the disease causes periodic epidemics associated with significant yield losses, particularly under conditions of moderate temperature and high humidity  <cit> . resistance to s. turcica has mainly been characterized in maize. s. turcica was earlier named helminthosporium turcicum and resistance has hitherto been designated ht and conferred by major race-specific genes  or via partial resistance, reviewed by welz and geiger  <cit> . in our work we designate the new resistance genes as st referring to setosphaeria turcica.

maize and sorghum are the most important staple cereals for sub-saharan africa . while maize is an introduced crop  <cit> , sorghum is believed to have been domesticated in ssa particularly in the nile basin or ethiopia, as recently as  <dig> bc  <cit> . sorghum like many other crop species experience large problems with plant pathogens, particularly fungal diseases. turcicum leaf blight incited by s. turcica is one main problem  <cit> . this disease has been considered as of minor importance in uganda until  <dig> when it caused extensive yield losses on maize  <cit> . by introducing improved resistance in new varieties the threat posed by the disease was subsequently reduced. severe and sporadic outbreaks of turcicum leaf blight have now reappeared in east africa  <cit> . a change in the s. turcica population has been suggested to be the main cause of this shift in disease pattern. in order to detect potential new changes of the s. turcica pathogen and the turcicum leaf blight disease, a survey was undertaken in uganda to examine the sorghum - s. turcica pathosystem in terms of disease severity and incidence, race patterns and new resistant resources  <cit> . it can be concluded from those studies that fungal isolates from sorghum could infect maize. upon cross inoculation on maize differential lines harboring different ht genes, four s. turcica isolates were identified as race  <dig>  two as race  <dig>  and one isolate corresponded to race  <dig> and race  <dig>  respectively, whereas  <dig> isolates were unclassified. highly resistant sorghum accessions originating from a regional collection were also identified.

in this work, we used cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism  on resistant and susceptible maize and sorghum genotypes to identify differentially expressed genes, when challenged with s. turcica. this was followed by functional assessment of selected gene candidates by virus-induced gene silencing  using a brome mosaic virus vector. we found one r-gene cluster, containing six cc-nb-lrr encoding genes residing as three pairs in the sorghum genome, of importance for defense to s. turcica. genome data further showed that the st genes are highly conserved within monocots.

RESULTS
identification of an up-regulated r-gene family in maize and sorghum in response to s. turcica inoculation
in order to identify important defense genes to s. turcica, cdna-aflp analysis was carried out on susceptible  and resistant  sorghum and maize genotypes following fungal infection. in our case, the ugandan sorghum genotypes ga06/ <dig>  and sila  and the maize a619ht <dig>  and a <dig>  lines were used. the sorghum material had earlier been evaluated on various agronomical traits including important fungal diseases. apart from s. turcica responses, ga06/ <dig> was found to be susceptible to cercospora sorghi, and colletotrichum sublineolum, whereas sila was susceptible to c. sorghi and resistant to c. sublineolum.

in total, approximately  <dig> transcript-derived fragments were monitored ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in size using different primer combinations . unique, up- or down-regulated transcripts in the resistant genotypes compared to the susceptible, sampled at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post inoculation  were excised, amplified, sequenced and analyzed for putative function. the final transcript-set comprised of  <dig> sorghum and  <dig> maize gene candidates. among these genes,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were putative stress-related according to closest genes identified in other organisms using blastp.

one cc-nb-lrr encoding putative r-gene , a member of a homologous gene pair with grmzm2g <dig> in the same locus on chromosome  <dig>  and uniquely expressed in the resistant maize genotype, was further studied . genome analysis revealed presence of  <dig> homologous genes in sorghum . these six genes were given the prefix st referring to s. turcica and designated st1a , st1b , st2a , st2b , st3a , and st3b . quantitative real-time pcr confirmed furthermore that five  of the six st genes showed high relative transcript levels when the sorghum resistant ga06/ <dig> plants were challenged with s. turcica . one gene, st1b, was expressed to a much lower extent compared to the other st genes, outside the limit of detection. in sila, only st2b and st3a showed a significant increase  in expressions when challenged with s. turcica .

the st genes are conserved among grasses
the six st genes in sorghum form three gene pairs in a cluster on chromosome  <dig> and share a common ancestor . st gene orthologs were also found in clusters when searching the rice, maize, foxtail millet and brachypodium genome databases. the st gene encoded proteins from the other grass species, grouped with the sorghum st proteins with high edge support  . the rice genome contains orthologs of sorghum st1a, st1b, st2a, st2b and an st <dig> gene . this indicates that the ancestor of rice and sorghum likely had a copy of these genes. sorghum st3a and st3b are likely a result of a more recent genome duplication event after the split between the rice and sorghum species . the rice genome also contains multiple copies of st1a, st2a and st2b orthologs, likely produced from gene duplications after the species split from sorghum. likewise, the setaria italica  genome contains orthologs of st1a, st1b, st2a and st2b, with seven of the nine genes found in a cluster within the same scaffold, as complete chromosome annotation have yet to be determined . an st <dig> homolog was not found in millet. in addition to the maize gene pair identified in our cdna-aflp analysis, blastp and blastn searches revealed a third single gene homolog, grmzm2g <dig>  st2a on maize chromosome  <dig> . the model grass brachypodium genome, on the other hand, has a gene pair orthologous to st1b on chromosome  <dig>  and one to st2b on chromosome  <dig>  but lacks all other gene homologs . the st gene cluster is maintained between sorghum, rice and possibly millet genomes but is smaller in maize and brachypodium with st genes located across or on different chromosomes.

sequence homology was also found between sorghum st proteins and arabidopsis cc-nb-lrr encoding genes . all six st proteins formed a cluster together with the cc rather than tir domain containing r proteins from arabidopsis indicating a closer evolutionary relationship as expected. the nearest related arabidopsis gene is rpm <dig>  a gene mediating resistance to pseudomonas syringae isolates expressing the avrrpml or avrb genes  <cit> .

adapting the vigs system on sorghum
genetic transformation of sorghum and maize is possible but laborious and requires other genotypes than those used in this study to be successful  <cit> . hence, our candidate genes were further studied using virus induced gene silencing  using the brome mosaic virus  system, previously used to silence genes in monocots  <cit> . vigs was followed by fungal inoculation to assess the potential defense function of the st genes. in our hands, the vigs procedure was not successful when applied to the a619ht <dig> maize genotype. because the st genes were up-regulated upon fungal inoculation with s. turcica in our sorghum ga06/ <dig> genotype , we continued the studies on our sorghum materials.

two vigs constructs  with high identity to the  <dig> st genes in sorghum were designed  including examination for their off-target gene silencing capacity. the highest non-st sorghum gene similarity belongs to a related r-gene pair, sb10g <dig> and sb10g <dig>  located in a different subgroup upon phylogenetic analysis , and used as a control for off-target gene silencing. the selected sequences were amplified and ligated into the third plasmid  in the bmv system, and used to infect the sorghum plants.

the vigs procedure was first optimized. sorghum seeds were surface sterilized before sowing to minimize additional stress by other microorganisms. mrna was produced by in vitro transcription, added to inoculation buffer and rubbed directly onto the second leaf of three week old sorghum plants. no intermediate step involving barley as virus host was used. the virus spreads systemically throughout the plant with silencing greatest in the second and third leaves above the inoculation site and complete silencing rarely achieved  <cit> . seven days post infection , light green colored streaks were visible on the third leaf, indicating viral symptoms and successful infection by the virus. in order to confirm onset of silencing quantitative real time-pcr was carried out on leaf samples from the vigs treated plants . there was a significant decrease in the relative transcript levels in relation to control plants inoculated with empty plasmid suggesting a clear down-regulation of five of the six targeted genes, particularly by construct  <dig>  in both sorghum genotypes. relative transcript levels of sb10g <dig> and sb10g <dig> were not influenced in vigs treatments indicating no off-target silencing.

silencing of st genes increases s. turcica infection in the resistant and susceptible sorghum genotypes
fungal colonization and growth on plants inoculated with the different vigs constructs compared with control material was carefully monitored. the different phenotypic observations are summarized in figure 6; and additional file  <dig>  fungal growth was further assessed by detaching infected leaves and placing them in a petri dish containing moist filter paper followed by incubation in the dark at 25°c for two days, as described by levy  <cit> . the development of conidiophores protruding through leaf lesions followed by rapid asexual spore development indicated fungal colonization of the leaf material, and a susceptible phenotype.

a hypersensitive response  occurred at  <dig> dpi on the resistant ga06/ <dig> genotype upon fungal challenge while the plants treated with empty vector produced a somewhat delayed hr phenotype  <dig> dpi. when vigs construct  <dig> was applied to ga06/ <dig> plants prior to fungal inoculation, larger and more numerous lesions with chlorotic halos developed compared to the control plants. disease lesions spread laterally along the leaf and fungal conidiophores and spores were produced under sporulating conditions. similarly, when the effect of construct  <dig> was assayed, the disease lesions were seen  <dig> dpi and spread laterally to form large lesions that produced large numbers of fungal spores. the disease lesions were larger than those induced by construct  <dig>  at  <dig> dpi. on the susceptible sila plants clear disease symptoms, necrotic spots, and chlorotic halos around fungal appressoria were seen  <dig> dpi. large numbers of asexual fungal spores were produced on conidiophores protruding from necrotic lesions. when sila plants were inoculated with the empty vigs vector, prior to fungal inoculation, similar disease symptoms occurred  <dig> dpi. in contrast, on sila plants inoculated with our vigs construct  <dig>  slightly larger and more frequent lesions appeared compared to control plants. the disease symptoms were further amplified when construct  <dig> was used, resulting in larger necrotic lesions, and profuse fungal sporulation. in order to correlate these observed disease phenotypes with fungal growth, fungal dna was quantified in the vigs materials . s. turcica dna increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ng sorghum dna in ga06/ <dig> leaves inoculated with vigs construct  <dig>  and to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ng sorghum dna when using construct  <dig>  from a near zero level in control plants . a significant  increase in fungal dna was also found in samples from sila inoculated with construct  <dig> , and construct  <dig> , compared to control samples with approximately  <dig>  pg/ng sorghum dna.

taken together, as expected the resistant ga06/ <dig> genotype showed a compromised defense response when inoculated with vigs construct  <dig> or  <dig> prior fungal inoculation. interestingly, we observed enhanced disease phenotypes on the susceptible sila genotype upon corresponding vigs treatments.

discussion
sorghum  serves as a major food staple and fodder resource especially in arid and semi-arid regions of the world  <cit> . it is mainly a self-pollinating and diploid grass species , with a genome size of 1c =  <dig> mbp, which is about 25% the size of the maize genome  <cit> . in the sorghum genome,  <dig> nb-lrr encoding r-genes are present, which is approximately half the number found in rice and slightly more compared to arabidopsis  <cit> . the number of nb-lrr encoding genes in the small genome of the wild grass brachypodium is estimated to  <dig>  <cit> . but in the much larger maize genome,  <dig> nb-lrr encoding genes have up to now been identified  <cit> . however, depending on search programs and threshold settings, slightly different r-gene numbers in each grass species are published.

it is postulated that the high numbers of r-genes in plant genomes and their large sequence diversity are essential evolutionary factors in the surveillance machinery to resist pathogen attacks. resistance genes evolve through duplication, unequal crossing over, recombination and diversification leading to clusters of paralogous genes  <cit> . the proliferation of r-genes is also coupled with rapid turnover of gene copies, eventually leading to deletion or expansion and thus dynamic r-gene clusters  <cit> . resistance gene clusters have also been found to be conserved between different species in poaceae  <cit> , although, such clusters are in the minority with  <dig> % being specific to a species  <cit> .

whole genome duplications occurred when the grass subfamilies diverged from each other and genome data suggest further, that paleo-duplicated gene pairs in sorghum and rice remained extant in about 17% of the cases  <cit> . recent duplications of chromosomal segments are particularly found on rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and corresponding regions on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> in sorghum. chromosome  <dig>  in the sequenced btx <dig> sorghum genotype, where the st genes are located showed the highest abundance  of r-genes  <cit> . thirty-six of these nb-lrr encoding genes are affected by recent duplication events based on the bioinformatic analyses presented by wang et al.  <cit> , including st3a and st3b, which is in agreement with our results . interestingly, the rice genome contains orthologs of st1a, st1b, st2a, st2b and a single ortholog of the st <dig> genes, all in one single locus. this indicates that this gene cluster predates the species split of rice and sorghum. in the grass family, sorghum, maize and millets belong to the same sub-family , whereas rice is located in ehrhartoideae  <cit> . it is estimated that these two subfamilies diverged from a common ancestor 50- <dig> million years ago together with pooideae, the subfamily to which brachypodium, wheat, and barley belong.

in a genome-wide comparison of arabidopsis thaliana and a. lyrata, the evolutionary pattern of the r-genes could be divided into two distinct groups, the positively selected  with high sequence divergence between the two species, or the stably selected genes   <cit> . the remaining genes were only found in one genome and absent from the other. the st genes found in this work have experienced few sequence exchanges resulting in low divergence, and hence more resemble the description of stably selected genes, although the copy numbers vary between the five grass genomes compared . that nb-lrr encoded r-genes remain conserved between different grass species is presently believed to be a common phenomenon  <cit> .

sorghum plants, particularly genotypes with red seed color, accumulate a range of phenolic substances in response to pathogen attacks  <cit> . large amounts of red-pigmented flavonoids induced at the site of infection were also seen in our materials, particularly in the resistant genotype. whether flavonoids contribute to the defense response against s. turcica is not elucidated but a genetic link has been found in the sorghum - c. sublineolum interaction, produced via the presence of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins  <cit> . reinforcement of plant cells via callose deposition upon pathogen attacks have been observed in many pathosystems. enhanced callose deposition has also been reported as a resistance response to s. turcica in maize  <cit> . despite extensive staining efforts, no callose accumulation was seen in either of our sorghum genotypes .

furthermore, our gene silencing work resulted in an enhanced susceptible response in sila, our susceptible sorghum cultivar. this observation may suggest that by targeting the st genes in this genomic background, effects on downstream signaling masked in the resistant sorghum genotype are revealed, and could potentially constitute a fraction of the quantitative traits earlier found  <cit> . this hypothesis is speculative and remains to be included in future functional studies of the st genes. future studies do also comprise a search for important effectors in the genome recently released from jgi http://www.jgi.doe.gov. in parallel, the sequence information from the st gene cluster is presently converted into molecular markers and used in germplasm assessments and breeding programs in east africa, an important development to sustain sorghum and maize crop production in this part of the world.

CONCLUSIONS
our cdna-aflp analysis on susceptible and resistance maize and sorghum genotypes challenged by s. turcica resulted in identification of a cc-nb-lrr encoding gene in maize. this gene resides in two loci on maize chromosome  <dig>  in sorghum,  <dig> st orthologous genes are present in a cluster of three pairs, on chromosome  <dig>  upon gene-silencing of the sorghum st genes, the resistance was clearly compromised, an observation that was supported by real-time pcr analysis and fungal dna quantification. database searches and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the st genes have a common ancestor present before the subfamily split, 50- <dig> million years ago, and the genes are highly conserved in sorghum, rice, foxtail millet, maize and brachypodium.
