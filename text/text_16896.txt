BACKGROUND
chemokine receptors are seven-transmembrane g-protein coupled receptors that direct the migration of various immune cells to the sites of inflammation in addition to their pivotal role in maintaining immune cell homeostasis in various lymphoid compartments  <cit> . chemokines , the ligands of chemokine receptors, are broadly classified based on the positioning of the two conserved cysteines into the cc, cxc, c or cx3c family  <cit> . binding of chemokines to their cognate receptors on immune cells triggers a signaling cascade primarily mediated by the gαi family of g proteins leading to a variety of cell effector functions including chemotaxis, degranulation, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf α  <cit> .

the cc family chemokine receptor  <dig>  is primarily expressed in almost all circulating monocytes. ccr <dig> is believed to mediate extravasation of blood monocytes to the sites of inflammation  <cit>  and is implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis  <cit> . mcp subfamily members, namely mcp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  bind to ccr <dig> with high affinity  <cit> . several studies involving genetic deletion of ccr <dig> or mcp- <dig>  and antibody neutralization studies of mcp- <dig> have clearly established the critical role of the ccr2/mcp- <dig> axis in mediating several key pathogenic events in animal models of multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis.

the major challenge in the development of small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists is the lack of cross-species activity to the receptor in the preclinical species. for example, bx- <dig>  a small molecule antagonist for ccr <dig>  exhibits low nano-molar affinity to the human receptor but has sub-micromolar to high micromolar affinity to the rat and mouse ccr <dig> receptors, respectively  <cit> . importantly, bx- <dig> had intermediate affinity to the rabbit ccr <dig> receptor  <cit> . this imposes significant challenges to compound testing in efficacy and toxicology studies in the preclinical models.

in recent years, rabbits have been used to study the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease model. it has been recently shown that the therapeutic potential of thiazolidinediones in rabbit model of balloon injury and re-endothelialization is associated with a decrease in mcp- <dig> expression  <cit> . in addition, the efficacy of a cxcr <dig> antagonist has been successfully demonstrated in a chronic antigen induced arthritis model  <cit> . moreover, ccr <dig> antagonists have therapeutic benefit in a rabbit allograft rejection model  <cit> . in the present study we report the cloning and functional characterization of the rabbit ccr <dig>  we also demonstrate that the recently reported ccr2/ccr <dig> dual antagonist, tak- <dig>  exhibits high level of potency against rabbit ccr <dig> in both binding and chemotaxis assays.

RESULTS
cloning and expression analysis of rabbit ccr2
full-length cdna sequence of rabbit ccr <dig> was cloned from total spleen rna of new zealand white rabbits using a pcr based method. the deduced amino acid sequence of rabbit ccr <dig> encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids  that shared  <dig> % identity to the human ccr2b receptor. the sequence alignment with the mouse, rat and rhesus monkey ccr <dig> is also depicted in fig.  <dig>  rat and mouse ccr <dig> contained additional  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus compared to human, monkey and rabbit ccr <dig>  in addition, one amino acid deletion in rabbit ccr <dig> was observed at position  <dig> . cysteines that were essential for the disulfide bond formation were also conserved in rabbit ccr <dig>  based on the ss and 2ss model  <cit> , cysteine pairs  in rabbit ccr <dig> were highly conserved compared to its counterparts from all known species. expression levels of rabbit ccr <dig> were also determined in various rabbit tissues using taqman analysis. rabbit ccr <dig> was abundantly expressed in lungs and spleen compared to low levels of expression in brain, heart, liver and testis .

radioligand binding studies in rabbit ccr <dig> expressing cells
stable cell lines expressing rabbit ccr <dig> in u- <dig> cells were generated to characterize the binding properties of radiolabeled human mcp- <dig> or mouse je to rabbit ccr <dig>  the binding affinity of radiolabeled human mcp- <dig> or mouse je was measured using a competition binding assay of the respective cold ligands. as shown in figs.  <dig>  125i-mouse je showed high affinity with a calculated kd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and bmax of  <dig> ±  <dig> dpm. in contrast, 125i-human mcp- <dig> has less binding affinity to rabbit ccr <dig> with lack of saturable binding as high as  <dig> nm of hot ligand . detailed examination of the binding characteristics of radiolabeled human mcp- <dig> to rabbit ccr <dig> will be necessary to resolve this discrepancy. to address the point, future studies are necessary to understand rabbit ccr <dig> binding characteristics and pharmacology with 125i-rabbit- mcp- <dig> 

receptor pharmacology of rabbit ccr <dig> was studied using a variety of ligands that belonged to the mcp subfamily and irrelevant ligands such as rantes, mip-1α and mip-1β. as expected, human mcp- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> differentially competed the binding of radiolabeled mouse je with ki values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively. in contrast, cold mcp- <dig> failed to compete je binding to rabbit ccr <dig> when used at concentrations as high as  <dig> nm . in addition, irrelevant ligands that bind with high affinity to ccr <dig> or ccr <dig> were unable to compete binding of radiolabeled mouse je to rabbit ccr <dig>  while cold je competed binding with a ki value of  <dig>  nm . tak- <dig> is a well characterized small molecule antagonist of both ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  and has a  <dig> nm affinity against human ccr2b receptor  <cit> . we tested the activity of tak- <dig> on rabbit ccr <dig> transfected cells using radiolabeled mouse je in a standard competition binding assay. as shown in fig. 5c, tak- <dig> was also highly potent against rabbit ccr <dig> with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  nm.

functional characterization of rabbit ccr <dig> stable cell line
in order to confirm whether rabbit ccr <dig> expressed in u- <dig> cells is functionally coupled to gαi family of g proteins, chemotaxis assays were conducted using both parental u- <dig> and u-937/rabbit ccr <dig> stable transfectants. cells were incubated in the top chamber in the presence of increasing concentrations of ligand in the lower chamber. parental u- <dig> failed to migrate to either human mcp- <dig> or mouse je. in contrast, u-937/rabbit ccr <dig> stable transfectants migrated effectively to either human mcp- <dig> or mouse je . the maximal migration was observed at roughly  <dig> nm of ligand and ranged from 20– <dig> % total input compared to  <dig> – <dig> % of cells migrating in the absence of any ligand. a typical bell-shaped curve was observed in the chemotaxis response with either human mcp- <dig> or mouse je. as expected, both parental and rabbit ccr <dig> stable cell lines migrated well to the cxcr <dig> ligand sdf-1α . the antagonist effect of tak- <dig> was also examined against rabbit ccr <dig> in the presence of defined concentration of either mouse je or hmcp- <dig> . preincubation of rabbit ccr <dig> expressing cells with tak- <dig> effectively blocked migration of either mouse je or hmcp- <dig> with an ic <dig> of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively . as expected, tak- <dig> inhibited mcp- <dig> dependent migration of u-937/hccr2b stable cells with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  nm 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have cloned the full-length rabbit ccr <dig> cdna and proved that the receptor is functional by expressing rabbit ccr <dig> in u- <dig> cells. the sequence of rabbit ccr <dig> will provide additional insight into the molecular evolution of chemokine receptors in different species. more importantly, the data obtained on cross-species activity of the ccr <dig> antagonist will provide valuable tools to perform toxicology and efficacy studies in the rabbit model.
