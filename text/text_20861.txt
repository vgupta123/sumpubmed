BACKGROUND
osteolytic bone disease is a common complication of multiple myeloma, with 70% of patients having bone lesions at diagnosis  <cit> . bone-destroying osteoclasts are more active in myeloma than bone-forming osteoblasts, ultimately leading to bone destruction. these lesions weaken bone, causing pain, spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia, and increased risk of fractures  <cit> . moreover, bone repair appears to be inhibited at sites of osteolytic lesions. the standard method for detecting bone lesions is through a radiographic  skeletal survey, which is relatively insensitive. studies have demonstrated that whole-body computerised tomography  scans are better than x-rays for detecting bone lesions; however, concerns about radiation dose exist  <cit> . while radiological evaluation of the bony skeleton is important for detecting bone disease in mm patients, imaging studies only provide cross-sectional information reflecting bone dynamics. even the most sensitive imaging techniques only detect established cortical bone destruction.

biomolecules, measured in biofluids such as blood or urine provide for longitudinal information concerning bone disease. indeed mm is characterised by repeated relapses, with increasing destruction at relapse  <cit> ; sensitive markers of osteoclast destruction therefore may detect sub-clinical bone destruction and allow for early preventative intervention. specifically, elisa-based bone marker assays would offer a low cost, widely accessible, non-radiation-based method of longitudinally monitoring dynamic changes in osteoclast activity  <cit> . current bone biomolecules can be divided into two categories, collagen fragments released from the bone matrix during resorption ; and enzymes released from either osteoblasts or osteoclasts. biomarkers reflecting osteoclast-mediated degradation of collagen include n-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type- <dig> collagen , c-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type- <dig> collagen , c-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type- <dig> collagen generated by metalloproteinase , and deoxypyridinoline . procollagen type- <dig> n-propeptide  and procollagen type- <dig> c-propeptide  signify new bone formation  <cit> . tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isotype 5b  is an enzyme used as a marker of osteoclast number and activity, while bone-specific alkaline phosphatase  and osteocalcin , produced by osteoblasts, are used as markers of osteoblast number and activity  <cit> . receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa b ligand  and osteoprotegerin  are also important markers of bone turnover. rankl increases osteoclast activity and is regulated by opg, the soluble decoy receptor for rankl, which serves as an inhibitor of rankl activity. the rankl/opg ratio therefore can serve as an index of osteoclastogenic activity  <cit> . although these biochemical markers of bone destruction and formation are useful measurements in assessing the extent of myeloma bone disease, no individual marker has proved to be completely effective at mirroring the dynamics of bone disease activity  <cit> .

in this investigation, we applied a discovery proteomics-based approach to identify novel circulating biomolecules that accurately correlate with degree of bone disease in mm patients.

label-free mass spectrometry
in total  <dig> proteins were positively identified in the proteominer enriched serum samples using progenesis lc-ms to align these runs, of which  <dig> differentially expressed proteins are included in the protein table . label-free mass spectrometry is a powerful and widely-used technique for identifying and quantifying relative changes in complex protein samples, including serum. serum presents a significant challenge in proteomics research, displaying a huge dynamic range which exceeds ten orders of magnitude. to help overcome this problem, proteominer™ pre-fractionation was employed to compress the dynamic range and facilitate the discovery of disease-related biomolecules found in the serum proteome. of the proteins identified during the discovery phase, complement c4-a , apolipoprotein b- <dig>  and serum paraoxonase/arylesterase  were selected for further analysis in a larger cohort of patient samples. previous work by our group has demonstrated that serum levels of c <dig>  b <dig> and pon <dig> are abnormal in patients found to be responders/non-responders to mm therapies, including thalidomide and bortezomib , therefore it would be of interest to see if any correlation existed with bone disease, especially as these proteins appeared in the discovery phase protein list.table  <dig>

discussion
protein analysis, specifically looking at serum proteins found to have differences in abundance levels associated with disease phenotype, in this case pre-malignant mm and mm patients diagnosed with no bone disease or high bone disease, can help delineate the complex mechanisms of bone biology and also provide clinicians with a suite of biomarkers to aid in the management of mm patients. in this investigation, proteominer fractionated patient samples were analysed using a bottom-up  label-free mass spectrometric proteomic strategy for biomarker discovery. a number of proteins found to be statistically significant, correlating with bone disease, were identified including enzymes, extracellular matrix glycoproteins, and members of the complement system. c <dig>  b <dig> and pon <dig> were selected for further analysis in a larger independent cohort of patient samples , with both c <dig> and pon <dig> confirmed to be significantly associated with bone disease.

mm is characterised by repeated relapses ultimately culminating in fatal refractory disease. the rate of mm bone disease increases with progression of disease. while ct and mri scans have improved resolution and sensitivity for detecting bone disease, there is a need for more sensitive biochemical markers that will detect sub-clinical bone disease,  <cit> . protein markers of bone turnover provide clinically useful supportive information on bone homeostasis by measuring enzymes, cytokines and collagen breakdown products released during bone formation and of degradation products produced during bone resorption. a range of biochemical bone markers are available that allow a specific and sensitive evaluation of the rate of bone formation and bone resorption of the skeleton; however, none of the currently known biomarkers are used in clinical practice, and more robust and sensitive biomarkers are needed to both monitor bone turnover and aid in managing patients with bone disease  <cit> . due to expense, access to radiology, and radiation exposure, radiology techniques are used in the setting of rising paraprotein or new symptomatology. the majority of patients will already have new bone lesions and/or fracture  <cit> . moreover, there is a concern that existing bone markers are not interpretable in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy  <cit> . these challenges reinforce the need for non-invasive, informative, and sensitive bone markers that will allow for early detection of bone disease and preventative intervention.

it was observed that complement factor h-related protein  <dig> and complement c1s subcomponent were present at lower concentrations in the patients with high bone disease compared to no bone disease. the complement system is made up of a series of about  <dig> proteins, two-thirds of which circulate in the plasma while the remainder are present on cell and tissue surfaces. a recent review discusses the link between the complement proteins and their role in bone development and homeostasis, specifically investigating their influence on osteoblast and osteoclast activity  <cit> . the complex interplay between these systems is still not fully understood but increasing evidence points to the complement anaphylatoxins influence the migration of bone cells and the controlled interactions between osteoblast and osteoclast. c <dig>  as a major protein of the classical cascade potentially has an important role in these important interactions. this system works to “complement” the activity of antibodies in destroying bacteria, either by facilitating phagocytosis or by puncturing the bacterial cell membrane; however, recent developments have shed some light on the role of the complement system in bone formation and maintenance. we for the first time found complement c4-a to be increased in the high bone disease patient cohort. in the larger validation cohort, increasing levels of complement c <dig> were determined when moving from mgus/smm to no-bone disease to high-bone disease phenotypes. increased c <dig> values have previously been associated with systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, severe bacterial or viral infections, cancer, and myocardial infarction . zheng and co-workers reported increased levels of complement c <dig> in mm patients, suggesting that upregulation of complement components is due to defective activation  <cit> .

both apolipoprotein b <dig> and pon <dig> were selected for further analysis in a larger sample set. b <dig> was not found to be significant in the validation cohort, but pon <dig> did show a stepwise increase in concentration from mgus/smm to high bone disease . serum paraoxonase/arylesterase  <dig>  degrades chemicals including several types of organophosphate pesticides and pharmaceutical drugs in the body. pon <dig> also has antioxidant properties, protecting both high- and low-density lipoproteins from oxidation associated with changing mineral content and decreased formation of bone  <cit> . polymorphisms and abnormal enzymatic activity of pon <dig> have also been implicated in heart disease, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and cancer . moreover, pon <dig> can directly suppress the macrophage pro-inflammatory response  <cit> . the pon <dig> gene is activated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ , a member of the ligand-activated nuclear receptor superfamily  <cit> . redox balance in bone cells is a key modulator of normal functioning, and the increased levels of pon <dig> detected in patient serum samples in this study may therefore represent a protective mechanism against the effects of oxidative stress on bone formation associated with osteoclastic resorption. oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of bone diseases such as osteoporosis, increase in osteoclasts activity and upregulation of osteoclast differentiation. therefore, it could be proposed that the increased levels of pon <dig> are in response to this increased stress, to facilitate the antioxidant bioscavenger of this molecule and try to re-balance bone remodelling.

a number of other proteins were found to be significantly correlated with different levels of bone disease. cells adhere to the extracellular matrix through interaction with adhesive extracellular matrix glycoproteins, including vitronectin  and fibronectin . vtn, also known as s-protein, is a multi-functional plasma and extracellular matrix protein with defined activity in cell adhesion, thrombosis, complement activation, fibrinolysis, inflammation, and platelet adhesion. several groups have shown the important role that vitronectin plays in the development and regulation of bone structure . fn <dig> is a multifunctional, extracellular matrix glycoprotein composed of two disulfidebound polypeptides of molecular weight  <dig> kda exhibiting structural and adhesive properties in cell-associated fibrillar matrices. similar to vtn, fn <dig> is implicated in early stages of bone formation, and continuous presence of fn <dig> is required for maintaining the integrity of the bone matrix . our discovery phase results demonstrate a significant elevation in the concentrations of both vtn and fn <dig> in high bone disease compared to no bone disease patient samples, suggesting that these proteins are released into the circulation due to increased bone resorption related to stimulation of osteoclast formation and activity. these results compare with the distribution of type i collagen fragments after osteoclastic degradation, including ntx and ctx, markers which are used for the early diagnosis of bone lesions  <cit> . finally, bisphosphonate treatment at the time of sample collection was an important consideration with respect to the potential impact that this treatment would have on expression of the candidate biomarkers. statistical analysis showed that bisphosphonate treatment did not significantly impact c <dig> and pon <dig> levels, suggesting their potential utility in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, in combination with existing biochemical tests and mri/ct scanning.

from the information in the supplementary table, both c4a and pon <dig> were found to be elevated in patients responding to treatment, while in this study, both were found to increase in concentration in the high bone disease group compared to both the pre-malignant myeloma and no bone disease cohorts. therefore, a direct link between disease burden and the levels of these candidate biomarkers is not obvious and may indicate a more defined role in measuring bone disease. a limitation of this investigation is the number of groups analysed in the validation phase. pre-malignant myeloma and both no/high bone disease cohorts were examined. ideally this would be expanded out to include multiple myeloma disease stages with associated bone disease information. also, the main utility of these proposed biomarkers would be in tracking individual patients during the course of their disease, investigate how the abundance of these biomarkers changes in relation to disease state and how this information could be useful in patient management.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study identifies novel candidate biomarkers associated with bone disease in mm patients. these novel biomarkers are currently being further evaluated in prospective studies of mm bone disease to assess their clinical utility.
