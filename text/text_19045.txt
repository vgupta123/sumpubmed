BACKGROUND
prolactin  is a lactogenic hormone that is mainly produced by the anterior pituitary gland. prl has multiple functions that regulate reproduction, development and growth, osmosis, metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids and the immune system. each of these functions requires expression of the prl receptor in different extra-pituitary regions  <cit> . in the immune system, interaction between hormones and receptors activates the transcription of genes involved in different cellular functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine production  <cit> . prl has been implicated as a modulator of both cellular and humoral immunity  <cit> .

elevated serum levels of prl have been reported in several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis  <cit>  and systemic lupus erythematosus   <cit> , although this finding has not been reported for other diseases such as autoimmunity during chronic hepatitis c  <cit> . moreover, women with hyperprolactinaemia but without autoimmune disorders have been reported to have circulating autoantibodies  <cit> .

sle is an autoimmune rheumatic disease. serum samples from sle patients characteristically have very strong reactivity to a broad spectrum of nuclear components, including dna, rna, histones, rnp, ro, and la. these antibodies form immune complexes that are deposited in the kidneys and may cause proteinuria and kidney failure. the presence of these autoantibodies indicates abnormalities in the activation and development of b cells  <cit> , and both b and t cells express the prl receptor and produce and secrete prl  <cit> . sle mainly affects women of the reproductive age at a ratio of 9: <dig> compared to men, and this gender bias has been attributed to the immunostimulatory properties of hormones. sle symptoms tend to start or become exacerbated during pregnancy, when serum prl levels are high. high serum concentrations of prl correlate with sle activity  <cit> , and hyperprolactinaemic patients with antiphospholipid syndrome display significantly more serositis and peritonitis compared to healthy individuals.  <cit> . these findings have also been observed in the murine nzb × nzw model of lupus after the induction of hyperprolactinaemia, in which the presence of prl correlates with the early detection of immune complexes, proteinuria, and accelerated death  <cit> .

mrl-mpjfaslpr  mice have a mutation in the fas gene and develop a disease similar to sle, characterised by glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, splenomegaly, hypergammaglobulinemia and the production of anti-dsdna antibodies  <cit> . in this strain of mouse, eliminating b cells using an anti-cd <dig> antibody decreased manifestations of the sle-like disease, demonstrating the importance of b cells in sle physiopathology  <cit> . b cells start their maturation process in the bone marrow, undergoing the prob, preb and immature stages, and finish maturation in the spleen, where the transitional and mature b cell subsets can be found. these populations are distinguished by the expression of different surface molecules. allman et al. classified transitional b cells into three types: transitional- <dig> , transitional- <dig> , and transitional- <dig> , while mature b cells are classified as follicular  or marginal zone   <cit> .

the objective of this study was to determine whether different splenic b cell subsets express the prl receptor and if the presence of prl influences these b cells subsets and correlates with the development of lupus. we found that all b cell subsets expressed the prl receptor but that transitional b cells displayed higher expression levels compared to mature b cells. hyperprolactinaemia in mice susceptible to lupus accelerated the disease and increased the absolute numbers of t <dig> and t <dig> b cells but not mature b cells, suggesting that prl participates in the early stages of splenic b cell development.

RESULTS
expression of the prl receptor varies among the different splenic b cell subsets
the follicular, marginal zone, and transitional splenic b cell subsets were purified from c57bl/ <dig> wild-type mice by flow cytometry with greater than 95% purity  and were assayed for the expression of the prl receptor at the mrna and protein levels. we found that splenic b cells expressed the prl receptor, with transitional b cells showing the highest relative mrna expression . among the mature b cells subsets, mz b cells showed approximately two-fold higher expression  than the fo b cells  . at the protein level, we found that transitional b cells expressed the highest level of the prl receptor , followed by mz b cells  and fo b cells , similar to the pattern observed with prl receptor mrna expression . within the transitional subset, t <dig> b cells showed the highest protein levels of the prl receptor , followed by t <dig>  and t <dig>  b cells .

when the protein level of prl receptor among total splenic b cells from c57bl/ <dig> wild-type mice was compared with that in the lupus-prone mrl and mrl/lpr mice, we found a statistically significant  increase in prl receptor expression in the mrl mice  and in the mrl/lpr mice  than in the c57bl/ <dig> mice . the differences in prl receptor expression between mrl and mrl/lpr mice were also statistically significant  .

when individual b cell subsets were evaluated, we observed a statistically significant increase  in prl receptor protein expression in fo b cells from mrl/lpr mice  compared to that in cells from c57bl/ <dig> mice . prl receptor expression in mrl mice was only slightly elevated compared to that in c57bl/ <dig> mice. in mz b cells, there was not a statistically significant difference in prl receptor protein expression between c57bl/ <dig>  mrl and mrl/lpr mice . a statistically significant difference in receptor expression was observed in transitional b cells, with mfi of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the mrl/lpr strain,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in mrl strain and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the c57bl/ <dig> mice . among the transitional b cell subsets, t <dig> cells displayed the greatest levels of prl receptor protein expression in mrl/lpr  and mrl  mice but not in c57bl/ <dig>  mice. we found similar levels of prl receptor expression in t <dig> cells from mrl/lpr , mrl  and c57bl/ <dig>  mice, while t <dig> cells from the mrl/lpr mice showed the highest level , followed by mrl  and c57bl/ <dig> mice . of all the splenic b cell subsets, t <dig> cells from the mrl/lpr strain displayed the highest expression of the prl receptor .

induction of hyperprolactinaemia results in an early onset of sle in the disease-prone mrl/lpr and mrl mice and correlates with the increased expression of the prl receptor in transitional b cells
nine-week-old mrl/lpr, mrl and c57bl/ <dig> mice were treated with metoclopramide for six weeks to induce high levels of prl in the serum before testing for accelerated sle symptoms. the serum concentration of prl in the c56bl/ <dig> strain was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml before treatment and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml when treated with pbs, while mice treated with metoclopramide showed prl concentrations that were 10-fold higher than those before treatment . in the mrl mice, the serum prl concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml before treatment,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml when treated with pbs, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml after being treated with metoclopramide. in mrl/lpr mice, the serum prl concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml, and this concentration increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml in mice treated with pbs and to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml in mice treated with metoclopramide. although an increase in the prl concentration was observed in the mrl/lpr mice treated with pbs , this increase did not reach the levels observed in animals treated with metoclopramide . the consistent increase in the serum concentration of prl in metoclopramide-treated mice was considered to constitute hyperprolactinaemia and correlated with the premature onset of disease symptoms in lupus-prone mice .

lupus manifestations were compared in all mouse strains before and after metoclopramide and pbs treatments. the mrl/lpr mice treated with pbs developed proteinuria , constituting a significant increase compared to the beginning of the treatment . mrl/lpr mice treated with metoclopramide showed a greater increase in proteinuria . by comparison, mrl mice developed proteinuria after metoclopramide treatment  but not pbs treatment. metoclopramide-treated, pbs-treated and untreated mice were tested for serum concentrations of anti-dsdna antibodies of the igg isotype. a significant increase in anti-dsdna antibodies was observed in hyperprolactinaemic mrl/lpr mice  compared to mice treated with pbs  and the levels found at the beginning of the treatment . at the beginning of treatment in mrl mice, we did not detect the presence of anti-dsdna antibodies. however, we observed low concentrations of anti-dsdna antibodies after pbs treatment , and these concentrations increased significantly in hyperprolactinaemic mice . the c57bl/ <dig> mice did not develop proteinuria after pbs or metoclopramide treatment, and we did not detect anti-dsdna antibodies under any condition studied . the main antibody isotypes found in both lupus-prone strains were igg2a and, to a lesser degree, igg <dig> . no statistically significant differences were found in the production of anti-dsdna antibodies of the igm isotype . taken together, these data indicate that metoclopramide treatment induces hyperprolactinaemia and that this state was associated with early manifestations of sle in the lupus-prone mrl and mrl/lpr mice.

next, we tested prl receptor expression in whole splenic b cell populations from the hyperprolactinaemic and pbs-treated control mice. however, we did not find any differences in prl receptor expression in c57bl/ <dig> mice regardless of age or treatment. in contrast, we found that mrl/lpr mice with hyperprolactinaemia showed a significant increased by more than two-fold in prl receptor expression compared to mice treated with pbs. therefore, hyperprolactinaemia correlated with upregulation of the prl receptor in splenic b cell populations. interestingly, in the mrl/lpr lupus-prone mice, the normal manifestations of sle occur at  <dig> weeks of age. when we compared prl receptor expression in splenic b cells from hyperprolactinaemic mice  and untreated diseased mice , no differences were found. we found no differences in prl receptor expression between the c57bl/ <dig> and mrl/lpr strains at  <dig> weeks of age. in contrast, there was a statistically significant increase in prl receptor expression in mrl/lpr mice at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks of age  .

during hyperprolactinaemia, there was a significant increase in prl receptor expression in mrl/lpr and mrl mice but not in c56bl/ <dig> mice . in addition, correlating with the expression patterns of the prl receptor in non-hyperprolactinaemic conditions , transitional b cells seemed to be the main cells responding to the high levels of prl by further increasing expression of the prl receptor. of the transitional b cells, t <dig> b cells were the population with the highest increase in prl receptor expression levels in mrl/lpr  and mrl mice , although all transitional b cell populations displayed increased prl receptor expression in the hyperprolactinaemic state in mrl/lpr  and mrl  mice . no significant changes were observed in the mature splenic b cell populations. these data suggest a role for prl in b cell development, mainly in splenic transitional b cells, that correlates with premature manifestations of sle.

mz, but not fo, b cells are altered in untreated and hyperprolactinaemic mrl/lpr lupus-prone mice
given that the greatest level of prl receptor expression was found in immature developing splenic b cells, we evaluated whether prl influences the absolute number of these cells. in agreement with a role for prl in developing splenic b cells, we found that hyperprolactinaemic mrl/lpr mice showed an increase in the absolute number of b cells  compared to untreated mice . however, no significant difference was found in mice treated with pbs at  <dig> weeks of age . similarly, hyperprolactinaemic mrl mice showed an increase in the absolute number of b cells  compared to untreated mice  and pbs-treated mice  . due to the different levels of prl receptor expression in the different splenic b cells populations, we analysed each b cell subset individually. figure 7b shows the mature mz and fo b cell pools before and after metoclopramide and pbs treatment in wild type c57bl/ <dig>  mrl and mrl/lpr mice. when these mature b cell subsets were quantified, mz b cells in mrl/lpr mice showed an increase in absolute numbers that correlated with the development of disease  <dig> weeks of age compared to  <dig> week mice , but no further significant increases were found in mz b cells from mice with hyperprolactinaemia . in mrl mice, we did not observe any differences between mice  <dig> weeks and those treated with pbs; however, hyperprolactinaemic mice showed an increase in the absolute number of mz cells . no differences in fo b cell numbers were detected regardless of the mouse strain or treatment tested . similarly, we did not detect any changes in the absolute numbers of fo or mz b cells from c57bl/ <dig> mice .

prolactin preferentially targets transitional- <dig> b cells and increases their absolute numbers in the spleen
the largest difference in the absolute number of splenic b cell was found in t <dig> b cells, correlating with the high level of prl receptor expression observed in this population. figure 8a displays the transitional populations and figure 8b displays the greater than two-fold increase in the absolute number of t <dig> b cells in the hyperprolactinaemic mrl/lpr mice compared to pbs-treated mice . the same phenotype was observed in mrl mice, in which the absolute number of t <dig> b cells only increased in the hyperprolactinaemic mice . in contrast, the absolute number of t <dig> b cells was not affected by hyperprolactinaemia in any of the strains, as shown in figure 8c. moreover, a small but significant increase was found in t <dig> b cells  from hyperprolactinaemic mrl/lpr mice  and mrl mice  compared to that in cells from pbs-treated mice . as expected, there were no differences in the absolute numbers of t <dig>  t <dig> or t <dig> b cells between the different treatment groups in c57bl/ <dig> mice. taken together, these data support a role for prl in b cell development through the regulation of the size of the t <dig> b cell pool in the spleen.

discussion
several studies have demonstrated a role for prolactin  and b cells in the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus   <cit> . in this study, we evaluated how prl affects the course of sle development in mrl/lpr, mrl, and wild-type mice and observed how this finding correlates with changes in the different splenic b cell subsets. the mrl/lpr strain has a mutation in the fas gene and develops a disease similar to sle  <cit> . mrl mice also exhibit autoimmune disorders despite carrying a normal fas gene, but the symptoms manifest much later in life than in mrl/lpr mice  <cit> . to our knowledge, this study is the first to address prl receptor expression in all of the different subsets of splenic b cells.

interestingly, expression of the prl receptor followed a similar pattern in b cells from wild-type c57bl/ <dig>  sle-prone mrl/lpr and mrl mice. expression of the prl receptor varied according to the b cell developmental stage. the highest expression of the prl receptor was observed in the immature, transitional splenic b cells. our findings are consistent with those reported by morales et al.  <cit> , who transfected prob cells with the prl receptor triggered their progression to the preb stage through incubation with prl. taken together, data from morales et al. and our group suggest that prl participates in early b cell differentiation. our results showed that the pattern of prl receptor expression levels in transitional b cells was different in c56bl/ <dig> mice and the lupus-prone mouse strains. t <dig> cells showed higher expression of the prl receptor in c7bl/ <dig>  while in lupus-prone strains the t <dig> cells showed higher expression. these data argue that there is altered expression of the prl receptor in different b cells subsets during the autoimmune process. furthermore, the differential presence of the receptor in transitional populations in c56bl/ <dig> mice suggests a regulatory role for prl in these cells under non-pathological conditions.

transitional b cells are constantly testing their antigen receptors  to identify b cell clones expressing receptors with self-specificity  <cit> . these clones then trigger different intrinsic mechanisms that eliminate this self-specificity. the mrl strains have a genetic background prone to develop a disease similar to sle either earlier in life in the case of mrl/lpr mice or later in the case of mrl mice. we found that the t <dig> b cell subset in both of these strains had the most prl receptor protein expression. therefore, it is possible that increased prl receptor expression at this stage in lupus-prone strains could promote both the rescue of autoreactive clones and b cell developmental progression, thus favouring the development of lupus symptoms. this observation is in agreement with the fact that prl receptor signalling increases the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl- <dig>  <cit>  and that t <dig> b cells from hyperprolactinaemic ovariectomised balb/c mice are more resistant to apoptosis than those from pbs-treated mice  <cit> . future experiments should address the molecular role of prl in this population and better define its contribution in autoimmune disease.

c57bl/ <dig>  mrl and mrl/lpr mice treated with metoclopramide showed a further increase in their serum prl levels that was only accompanied by increased levels of anti-dsdna antibodies and proteinuria in the mrl/lpr and mrl lupus-prone strains. these findings are in agreement with previous reports studying other hyperprolactinaemic and sle models, such as reports by mcmurray et al.  <cit>  who showed hyperprolactinaemia induced by pituitary gland transplantation in nzb × nzw mice, and a report by peeva et al. using recombinant prl to induce hyperprolactinaemia in sle3/ <dig> r4a-γ2b c57bl/ <dig> mice  <cit> . additionally, our data are consistent with several clinical trials showing that a high serum prl level correlated with sle disease activity  <cit> .

in our study, prl receptor mrna expression was increased in metoclopramide-treated 15-week-old mrl/lpr mice to a level similar to that found in untreated 25-week-old mice displaying high disease activity. this correlation between prl receptor levels and the degree of disease suggests that prl plays an important role in the development and exacerbation of sle. these results also support the idea that the prl receptor could be useful as an sle prognostic marker.

although our results showed that the t <dig> subset of b cells express the highest levels of the prl receptor in the spleens of c57bl/ <dig> mice, the absolute number of t <dig> cell and other b cell subsets and overall prl receptor expression were not affected by hyperprolactinaemia, and sle was not induced. this result differs from previous reports by peeva et al. and saha et al. describing decreased t <dig> b cell frequencies and increased t <dig> b cell frequencies after the induction of hyperprolactinaemia, while the mz and fo mature b cell pools were unaffected  <cit> . this finding may be due to the different experimental approaches used, in that different mouse strain was used , balb/c mice were ovariectomised, a procedure that eliminates oestrogen and progesterone and affects immune responses  <cit> . in addition, we treated mice with metoclopramide to induce the hyperprolactinaemic state, whereas peeva and saha used ovine prl.

in our study, hyperprolactinaemia resulted in up-regulation of prl receptor expression and a significant increase in the absolute numbers of t <dig> b cells in the mrl/lpr mice. pbs-treated mice did not show increases in the absolute number of t <dig> cells, despite an increase in prl receptor expression, we believe that this is because the level of prl receptor expression in pbs-treated mice never reached the levels found in either pharmacologically induced or age-related hyperprolactinaemic mice. additionally, in the mrl strain, the absolute number of t <dig> cells only increased in hyperprolactinaemic mice, correlating with the early onset of lupus symptoms and increased prl receptor expression. a similar observation has been noted in nk cell lines, in which high prl receptor expression correlates with an enhanced capacity of the cells to proliferate  <cit> . this finding is also in agreement with the observation that the t <dig> population expresses the highest level of prl receptor expression before treatment and with other studies showing this subset to be more resistant to apoptosis in mice with hyperprolactinemia  <cit> . thus, our data and that of others  <cit>  support the importance of prl in b cell development, in developmental associated processes such as proliferation and resistance to negative selection and in the progression of sle. these findings highlight the idea that this disease originates at different levels, as indicated by its multifaceted nature.

we also found that hyperprolactinaemia increased the expression of the prl receptor and, to a lesser degree, the absolute numbers of t <dig> b cells. t <dig> b cells are considered by merrel to be a subset of anergic b cells produced by the interaction of the bcr and self-antigens and are not a part of the maturation pathway of b cells  <cit> . the t <dig> b cell subset is decreased in mrl/lpr mice, and this decrease has been proposed to be due to self-reactive clones escaping from an anergic state in this mouse strain. this diminished t <dig> population was described in 9-week-old mice; however, this time point is prior to disease onset, and these mice were compared to the genetically unrelated balb/c strain  <cit> . therefore, future work should determine the effect, if any, of prl signalling in this population and may generate interesting results.

the number of mz b cells in mrl/lpr mice increased with age and coincided with the course of the disease, as previously reported  <cit> . higher levels of serum prl induced a further increase in the mz b cell population, although this change was not significant when compared to mice of the same age treated with pbs. however, this increase in the absolute number of mz cells was statistically significant in hyperprolactinaemic-mrl mice. these results are consistent with a model in which prl increases the expression of its receptor mainly in immature transitional b cells, leading to self-reactive cell maturation with a potential bias toward the mz type.

although prl did not affect the absolute number of mature b cells or their prl receptor expression pattern, self-reactive clones were more active in hyperprolactinaemic mrl/lpr and mrl mice as shown by an increased concentration of anti-dsdna antibodies, specifically of the igg isotype. it will be interesting to discern the function of prl in the mz and fo mature populations, as it is clear that they perform different functions. while mz b cells are part of the innate immune system and preferentially respond to t cell-independent antigens, fo b cells perform the classic functions of adaptive immunity. mz b cells have mainly been associated with the expression of igm antibodies  <cit> .

our results show that both mrl/lpr and mrl mice develop an early onset of lupus symptoms after induction of hyperprolactinemia. although the mrl/lpr strain has an additional mutation in fas  <cit> , our results also suggest that this genetic change most likely has little, if any, effect on the accelerated lupus development. it is possible that strong prl signalling in immature t <dig> b cells from both mice strains could potentially trigger rescue from apoptosis induced by recognition of self-antigens and could also shape and promote their differentiation into specific mature b cell populations. the presence of self-reactive clones in mz b cells correlates with autoimmune diseases  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data support a role for prl in b cell development by primarily affecting the size of the t <dig> b cell pool in the spleen. although prl exhibits pleiotropic effects in different organs, our results are consistent with a preferential effect in the regulation of the prl receptor in the t <dig> population that is responsible for the observed altered b cell development and premature onset of sle symptoms. understanding the molecular mechanisms resulting in the development of sle will help to design prevention, treatment and follow-up strategies for this disease.
