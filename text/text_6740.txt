BACKGROUND
phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  is the major polyphosphoinositide species found in the plasma membrane  of all eukaryotic cells. this regulatory lipid has several functions in the pm: first, it was identified as the primary substrate of receptor-mediated phospholipase c  activation, to yield the second messengers, inositol- <dig> ,5-trisphosphate  and diacylglycerol  <cit> . ptdinsp <dig> is also important for endocytosis of pm proteins through its binding to several clathrin adaptors  <cit> . moreover, ptdinsp <dig> is required for the proper functioning of many ion channels and transporters  <cit>  and also contributes to the regulation of actin polymerization  <cit>  and attachment of the pm to the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . although the majority of ptdinsp <dig> is found in the pm, functional data suggest that the lipid may also regulate signaling complexes in other membranes and even within the nucleus  <cit> . the pivotal importance and pleiotropic functions of ptdinsp <dig> have demanded that its distribution and dynamics be followed with subcellular resolution preferentially in living cells. this was finally achieved with the introduction of the plcδ1-ph-domain gfp chimera as a molecular probe to detect ptdinsp <dig> in eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

the plcδ1ph-gfp reporter has since been widely used successfully to monitor ptdinsp <dig> dynamics under a variety of cellular settings  <cit> . this reporter has not shown significant amounts of ptdinsp <dig> in intracellular membranes other than endocytic vesicles in live cells  <cit> , although it detected some of the lipid in internal membranes in an em application  <cit> . this could reflect low abundance of ptdinsp <dig> in internal membranes or a requirement for other components present only in the pm for the ptdinsp2-dependent membrane recruitment of the plcδ1ph-gfp probe. moreover, because of its high-affinity binding to insp <dig>  the interpretation of the data obtained by the use of the plcδ1ph domain has become highly debated  <cit> . several studies have shown that insp <dig> can displace the plcδ1ph-gfp reporter from the membrane without an apparent change in the level of ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> . although, insp <dig> is mostly formed from ptdinsp <dig>  if the affinity of the probe is significantly higher for the soluble insp <dig> than for the membrane-bound ptdinsp <dig>  the translocation of the probe from the membrane to the cytosol will be disproportionally higher than the actual lipid decrease in the membrane  <cit> .

research in the last  <dig> years has clearly demonstrated that phosphoinositides may not be the sole determinants of the cellular distribution of phosphoinositide-binding protein-modules  <cit> . this raises the possibility that functionally distinct inositide pools are differentially reported on by different protein modules even if they recognize the same phosphoinositide species. because of these new developments and the limitations of the plcδ1ph-gfp, there is a need to evaluate other potential ptdinsp <dig> binding ph domains as reporters of the lipid in a true cellular setting. several protein modules have been shown to recognize ptdinsp <dig> based on in vitro binding assays. moreover, a detailed analysis of the ph domains identified in saccharomyces cerevisiae also revealed that many ph domains showing relatively limited phosphoinositide binding specificities could detect specific lipid pools probably because of their interaction with other components of signaling domains where these lipids are formed. therefore, even some of the domains that lack in vitro lipid binding specificity might be useful in reporting on some specific signaling inositol lipid pools within the cells. however, to decide whether a reporter is indeed a good sensor of ptdinsp <dig> one has to investigate the properties of these domains in live cells with controlled manipulation of ptdinsp <dig> 

in the present study we evaluated several yeast ph-domains characterized in  <cit>  as well as the tubby domain of the mammalian tubby protein  <cit>  for their ability to follow ptdinsp2changes in mammalian cells. our analysis shows that many but not all of the examined yeast ph domains can follow ptdinsp <dig> changes, but all have limitations and none is remotely better than the plcδ1ph domain. a more detailed comparison with the tubby domain shows that while the latter is a good ptdinsp <dig> reporter, its high affinity to the lipid and slow dissociation can also pose problems leading to underestimation of the ptdinsp <dig> changes. the similarities yet profound differences in the behavior of these isolated ptdinsp <dig> domains is a perfect example of how ptdinsp <dig> can interact and regulate multiple effector proteins simultaneously and yet differentially.

RESULTS
localization responses of lipid binding domains during manipulation of pm ptdinp2
several yeast ph domains showed pm localization in spite of varying in vitro inositide binding specificity as described in  <cit> . a selected panel of these ph domains was tested for their abilities to respond to changes in pm ptdinsp <dig> levels. in addition, the tubby domain of the tubby protein  <cit> , which has been described as a specific ptdinsp <dig> reporter  <cit> , was analyzed in more detail in comparison to the widely used plcδ1ph-gfp probe. the purpose of these studies was to evaluate the features of these protein domains in a cell line in which the phosphoinositide changes have been well characterized in the same laboratory. two detailed analysis with similar goals have been recently published, one using the full-length tubby protein  <cit>  and the other characterizing a mutant form of the isolated tubby domain  <cit> .

there were several other issues that made some of these domains less than optimal. the num1-ph domain - which has the highest specificity of ptdinsp <dig> binding in vitro  <cit> , - showed very poor expression when fused to the c-terminus of gfp. when the ph domain was placed in front of the gfp, its expression has significantly improved, but many cells expressing the domain showed peculiar structures with intense fluorescence. these appeared as vesicles that had just bud off but are still attached to the outer surface of the pm . the opy <dig> ph domain, on the other hand, showed very high affinity to the nucleus and nucleolus. this was partially overcome by placing a nuclear export signal in front of the gfp fusion protein . these results collectively indicated that the lipid binding characteristics of the yeast ph domains are not identical and in some cases the membrane localization is likely influenced by factors other than phosphoinositides. having tested the yeast ph domains, we decided to subject the mammalian tubby domain for a more detailed comparison with the widely used plcδ1ph-gfp.

comparative analysis of the tubby-domain and the plcδ1-ph domain
 <dig>  the tubby domain binds to the pm with higher affinity
when expressed in hek293-at <dig> cells, a significantly higher fraction of plcδ1-ph was found cytosolic compared to the tubby-domain. fig 2a shows representative images of hek-293-at <dig> cells expressing the two reporters either individually or together, tagged with fluorescent proteins of different colors . to quantify these differences, fluorescent intensity values were recorded along line-intensity histograms taken over the cells  and the pm vs. cytoplasmic intensity ratios were calculated. this ratio was substantially higher  for the tubby-domain than for plcδ1ph-gfp . this observation already indicated that the two probes have different apparent affinities to the pm, presumably to ptdinsp <dig>  based on these results, one would expect to see a competition between the two domains for the plasma membrane ptdinsp <dig> pools. however, no competition was observed between the two probes. this was consistent with our finding that the cytosol to pm ratio of either probe did not show significant differences depending on the expression level . these results suggested that cells can dynamically up-regulate their ptdinsp <dig> pools when such reporters are expressed and keep a fraction of the lipids sequestered. this could explain the lack of saturation of membrane binding of the domains.

to further elucidate the difference in the membrane binding properties, namely, the association/dissociation rates and mobility of the two probes, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  analysis in hek293-at <dig> cells expressing the gfp-tagged versions of the respective reporters. selected areas of the pm were bleached and the recovery of fluorescence was recorded . the mobile fraction- and t1/ <dig> values were calculated as described in the materials and methods. there was a small but statistically significant difference between the mobile fraction values of tubby-gfp  and plcδ1ph-gfp . . in contrast, the t1/ <dig> values showed more then a two fold difference between the two reporters . this difference was highly significant . in fact, the t1/ <dig> value of the tubby domain was close to that measured previously for the membrane anchored gfp-caax domain  <cit>  . these results were consistent with a higher affinity of the tubby-domain-gfp probe to its pm binding partner, most likely reflecting its slower dissociation rate. it is important to note that in a frap analysis the recovery of the fluorescence in the bleached area can occur as a result of both lateral diffusion  and dissociation from the membrane to the cytosol and rapid re-association . this feature was elegantly utilized to determine the diffusion properties of several gfp-fused ph domains in a recent study  <cit> . in the present analysis we selected the central area within a larger bleached region  to minimize the effects of lateral diffusion. yet, the slower recovery of the tubby domain was consistent with a rate similar to that of simple lateral diffusion.

 <dig>  response to agonist-induced plc activation
initial experiments showed that while plcδ1ph-gfp showed a full translocation in > 90% of cells from the membrane to the cytosol after  <dig> nm angii stimulation, the tubby domain-gfp construct had much more variable responses ranging from no detectable change to a full translocation. for a better comparison of the two probes during plc activation, the gfp-tagged tubby-domain and the mrfp-tagged plcδ1-ph domain were co-expressed in hek293-at <dig> cells. the dynamics of the redistribution of the two probes during this process was then followed after stimulation with different concentrations of angii. at high concentrations of angii  both reporters translocated rapidly from the membrane to the cytosol. however, while the translocation of plcδ1ph-gfp was almost always complete, that of the tubby domain was often partial. when the angii concentration was lowered to  <dig> nm, there was a significantly longer delay in the translocation of the tubby-domain compared to that of the plcδ1-ph domain . moreover, while a complete translocation of plcδ1ph-gfp always occurred at this concentration of angii stimulation, the tubby-domain either failed to translocate or did it only partially or with a significant time delay. as shown in fig. 3b, the average time required for half maximal translocation of plcδ1ph-mrfp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sec, while that of the tubby-domain was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sec  .

to determine the extent of maximum translocation of the reporters, high concentration of ionomycin  was added after angii stimulation. the high ca2+ concentration attained with this amount of ionomycin activates endogenous plc enzymes even without g-protein activation, completely eliminating both ptdinsp <dig> and ptdins4p from the cells  <cit> . this ensures displacement of all expressed reporters from the membrane allowing us to determine the fraction of the probe that showed translocation during agonist stimulation. as with the agonist, a significant delay in the translocation of the tubby-domain  compared to that of the plcδ1ph-gfp   was observed upon ionomycin addition . moreover, in the case of the plcδ1ph-gfp the cytoplasmic fluorescent intensity increases after angii and ionomycin were comparable , whereas in the case of the tubby-domain-gfp, the intensity increase after angii was only 30% of that observed after ionomycin. this confirmed the observation that  <dig> nm angii did not displace the tubby-domain completely from the pm. it is worth noting that lower concentration of ionomycin  that releases ca2+ and induces capacitative ca2+ entry evoked only a small or no response in cases of either reporter in naïve cells in agreement with other reports  <cit> .

in a subsequent set of experiments, we examined the response of the reporters to overexpresssion of a constitutively active gq . gq mediated plc activation has been the proposed mechanism by which the transcription factor tubby is released from the pm allowing its diffusion into the nucleus  <cit> . as in the previous experiments, the two reporters tagged with different color fluorescent proteins were co-expressed with the constitutively active α subunit of gq*. in a large number of cells, the decrease of ptdinsp <dig> due to plcβ activation was apparent, shown by a full or partial translocation of the plcδ1ph-gfp. the pm vs. cytoplasm ratio of the probe was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in a selected panel of cells, which is essentially a full translocation. however, in the very same cells, the tubby-domain was only partially translocated to the cytosol. the pm vs cytoplasm ratio was reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  from its control levels . fig.  <dig>  panel a shows representative images: one, where the tubby-domain localization is clearly visible, while the plcδ1ph domain is completely cytosolic , and another, where both reporters are cytosolic . importantly, even a low concentration of angii  rapidly displaced the remaining tubby-domain from the pm indicating that gq* has sensitized the system for a gq-coupled receptor agonist .

 <dig>  response to ptdinsp <dig> dephosphorylation
next, we studied the translocation of the probes when ptdinsp <dig> was eliminated with the help of a polyphosphoinositide 5-phosphatase . for this, we used the rapamycin-induced recruitment of the type iv 5-ptase to the pm that can acutely eliminate ptdinsp <dig>  <cit>  in cos- <dig> cells. we chose cos- <dig> cells because expression of the four constructs required for these studies did not yield high enough levels in hek <dig> cells to see a robust 5-phosphatase response. cells were transfected with the pm targeted frb-cfp, the 5-ptase-domain fused to fkbp12-cerulean, tubby-domain-gfp and plcδ1ph-mrfp. addition of  <dig> nm rapamycin causes rapid heterodimerization of the membrane-anchored frb with the fkbp <dig> protein fused to the cytosolic 5-ptase domain causing rapid translocation of the 5-ptase domain to the pm. . rapamycin led to the prompt and complete loss of both the tubby-domain and plcδ1ph domain pm localization . unlike with agonist or ionomycin stimulation, there was no significant difference between the speed and extent of translocation of the two reporters . the half maximal translocation of tubby-domain occurred at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sec and for the plcδ1ph domain this was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively  .

insp <dig> and ptdinsp <dig> binding properties of the tubby domain
previous reports have suggested that the tubby domain does not bind insp <dig> although no direct binding data have been presented  <cit> . to compare the inositol phosphate and inositol lipid binding characteristics of these reporters, we created the tubby-domain-gfp fusion protein for bacterial expression in a similar manner as described for the plcδ1ph-gfp  <cit> . first, the binding of -insp <dig> to the two recombinant proteins was examined under identical conditions. as shown in fig.  <dig>  panel a, plcδ1ph-gfp showed significant insp <dig> binding that was displaced by increasing amounts of the unlabeled ligand . in contrast, very little  -insp <dig> binding was found to the tubby-domain-gfp protein. however, binding of tubby-domain-gfp and plcδ1ph-gfp to lipid vesicles containing ptdinsp <dig> was very similar suggesting that the lack of insp <dig> binding was not due to misfolding of the tubby-domain. however, while the plcδ1ph domain could be displaced from the ptdinsp <dig> containing vesicles by increasing concentrations of insp <dig>  the tubby-domain showed no such displacement with insp <dig> . these experiments showed that tubby-domain indeed shows no significant insp <dig> binding.

inhibitory effects of the plcδ1ph-gfp and tubby-domain-gfp on ca2+ signaling
expression of protein domains that bind to ptdinsp <dig> and/or insp <dig> can exert an inhibitory effect on ca2+ signaling. binding to ptdinsp <dig> can sequester a fraction of the lipid in the membrane and also hamper its availability to plc enzymes. binding and buffering of insp <dig>  on the other hand, will delay the onset of the ca2+ release and also inhibit coupling between the individual ca2+ release events causing a slower and smaller cytoplasmic ca2+ increase  <cit> . we, therefore, compared the effects of overexpression of the tubby-domain-mrfp p <dig> binder), plcδ1ph-mrfp p <dig> and insp <dig> binder) and the p130ph-mrfp  on the agonist-induced ca2+ signals. red versions of these constructs were used not to interfere with the ca2+ measurements with fura- <dig>  at the end of the experiments high concentration of ionomycin  was used to release the constructs to the cytosol so that their red fluorescence intensities within the individual cells could be comparably determined as a quantitative measure of their expression level. cos- <dig> cells stimulated via their endogenous p2y receptor were used in these studies because atp causes modest plc activation and insp <dig> increases, where interference from the expressed constructs could be better assessed than in the hek293-at <dig> cells, where the robust plc activation can override the inhibitory effects of these molecules.

recorded cells were grouped into four categories based on their expression level of the respective constructs  and their averaged ca2+ responses were calculated. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the largest effects on delaying the ca2+ signal and desynchronizing the response was observed with the p130ph-mrfp construct. it is clear  that this construct delays and inhibits the ca2+ signal very potently. there was very little  difference between the plcδ1ph and tubby domains in their effects on ca2+ signaling; both domains showed inhibition, but only at higher expression levels. the delay in the ca2+ rise was slightly bigger in the case of the plcδ1ph-mrfp construct .

* the lag time of the ca2+ response was defined as the time it takes for a cell to reach half-maximum of its ca2+ peak after addition of  <dig> μm atp.

**values are calculated from cells expressing the mrfp-tagged proteins at the indicated intensities. note the largest effects of the p130-ph-mrfp protein that does not bind to the membranes but binds insp <dig> with comparable affinity to the plcδ1ph-mrfp  <cit> .

effects of insp <dig> buffering on the translocation responses of the two domains
since the plcδ1ph domain has significant insp <dig> affinity, large insp <dig> increases can promote the translocation of the plcδ1ph-gfp fusion protein from the membrane to the cytosol  <cit> . based on our in vitro insp <dig> binding experiments, the tubby domain does not have such an insp <dig> binding property. as shown above and in  <cit> , overexpression of the p <dig> ph domain binds insp <dig> and buffers its agonist-induced increases. to determine whether such insp <dig> buffering has an impact on the translocation of the two studied ptdinsp <dig> reporters, the gfp-tagged versions of either the tubby-domain or the plcδ1ph domain were co-expressed with p130-ph-mrfp in hek293-at <dig> cells and their translocation responses were followed upon the addition of  <dig> nm angii. again, to determine the extent of maximum translocation of the reporters, high concentration of ionomycin  was added after angii stimulation. to decrease the speed and the amplitude of insp <dig> changes, these experiments were performed at room temperature as opposed to 35°c. this condition also ensured that the plcδ1ph domain response is not examined at saturation.

as shown in fig.  <dig>  the translocation responses of the plcδ1ph domain and tubby domain at room temperature showed differences similar to those observed with the  <dig> nm angii at 35°c. the amplitude of the tubby domain translocation was only partial, while that of plcδ1ph was complete relative to the maximal response evoked by high concentration of ionomycin. comparison of the responses of the respective constructs in the presence or absence of the p130ph-mrfp showed that insp <dig> buffering in these cells had only small  effect on the translocation responses. in both cases the amplitude of the angii response was slightly smaller, slower and more prolonged in the p130ph-mrfp expressing cells, which was consistent with a buffered insp <dig> . the fact that both constructs showed the same alteration of the translocation responses suggests that it is the slight distortion of the ca2+ signal rather than the buffered insp <dig> change per se that was responsible for these changes. it is important to note that in contrast to the atp-stimulated cos- <dig> cells in which plc activation is modest , the insp <dig> changes and the translocation responses are a lot more robust in the angii-stimulated hek293-at <dig> cells and, in the latter, p130ph-expression has only a modest effect on the angii induced ca2+ signal . however, while the cos- <dig> cells are ideally suited to determine the effects of insp <dig> binding or impaired substrate access of plc when the cells express the ptdinsp <dig> reporters, the hek293-at <dig> cells are more useful to determine the effects of insp <dig> buffering on reporter translocation because their supramaximal insp <dig> responses can be significantly blunted before affecting their cytoplasmic ca2+ signals. these results together suggested to us that at least in our cellular model, the insp <dig> changes primarily affect the translocation responses of either domain via their effects on cytoplasmic ca2+-plc rather than via direct displacement.

discussion
the present study was designed to widen the repertoire of phosphoinositide binding modules capable of providing information on ptdinsp <dig> changes in mammalian cells. so far most such studies have utilized the plcδ1ph-gfp construct, which does not detect ptdinsp2in cellular location other than the pm and also could suffer from overestimating ptdinsp <dig> decreases, due to a displacing effect of insp <dig>  the extent of this distortion may vary from cell-type to cell-type and also depends on expression levels  <cit>  and, therefore, has been a matter of dispute  <cit> .

in a thorough recent study, several ph domains of s.cerevisiae have been described as capable of phosphoinositide binding, although only one, the num1p ph domain, showed decent ptdinsp <dig> binding specificity based on several in vitro binding assays  <cit> . however, in vivo studies in yeast mutants that allowed specific manipulations of phosphoinositides concluded that pm targeting of several of these ph domains  showed ptdinsp <dig> dependence, while the membrane recruitment of the opy1p-ph domain was found to be independent of phosphoinositides. we extended these studies to mammalian cells and characterized the ptdinsp <dig> dependence of the membrane association of these ph domains using controlled manipulations of ptdinsp <dig>  as described before, all of these ph domains showed pm localization and none was recruited to any intracellular membranes, although some  also showed nuclear or nucleolar localization. the expression of some of these ph domains  was very low and required switching the gfp around to improve expression. adding a nuclear export signal to the gfp-opy1p-ph construct allowed a better assessment of its membrane binding properties. remarkably, the behavior of these constructs did not completely match with that described in yeast cells. for example, the ph domains of cla4p, skm1p, and slm2p showed no detectable decrease during plc activation or after elimination of ptdinsp <dig> via a 5-phosphatase. in contrast, the opy1p ph domain followed the changes in ptdinsp <dig> in spite of its apparent failure to do so in yeast. unfortunately, the num1p ph domain that binds ptdinsp <dig> with the highest specificity in yeast cells did not show any features that would make it a great substitute for plcδ1ph-gfp. first, its expression was modest and in cells showing higher expression, it created bright vesicular structures budding off the plasma membrane. moreover, it showed only a modest translocation from the membrane to the cytosol after plc activation. one of the probes, the slm1p-ph appeared to be a mixed reporter of ptdinsp <dig> and ptdins4p in the membrane. this domain was only partially displaced from the membrane after 5-phosphatase recruitment, suggesting that it may still be binding to the ptdins4p that is generated by the 5-phosphatase.

the discrepancy between the probes behavior in the yeast and mammalian cells is not unprecedented. for example, we did not observe golgi localization of the ptdins4p reporter osh2-ph in mammalian cells  <cit>  while it clearly showed the golgi pool in yeast  <cit> . this is suggestive of a more complex mechanism of membrane recruitment of the ph domains, involving not only phosphoinositides but probably other proteins  as interacting partners. whether a mammalian protein can substitute for the yeast protein in the protein-protein interaction with a yeast ph domain probably varies from one domain to another, making the outcome difficult to predict. nonetheless, these studies have concluded that none of the predicted ptdinsp <dig> recognizing probes from the yeast ph domain collection have detected other pools of this lipid in intracellular compartments and none has shown any obvious advantage over the mammalian ones to be used in imaging studies. this is in contrast to ptdins4p recognizing ph domains of the yeast that have been successfully used in mammalian cells  <cit> .

another ptdinsp <dig> reporter characterized in this study was the tubby domain of the mammalian transcription factor tubby protein. the tubby domain was described as a high affinity ptdinsp <dig> binding module found at the c-terminus of the tubby protein and being responsible for its lipid binding and membrane localization  <cit> . it was also claimed as one that does not bind insp <dig>  although direct experimental evidence for this has not been available in published literature. the tubby domain has already been used as a ptdinsp <dig> reporter  <cit>  and two recent studies have examined the usefulness of the full-length tubby protein  <cit>  or a mutant form of the tubby domain  <cit>  as a ptdinsp <dig> probe in comparative studies similar to ours. our results with the wild-type tubby domain had several similarities, but also notable differences to the results described in those studies.

firstly, both studies found that the tubby protein as well as the tubby domain has higher affinity to the pm than plcδ1ph-gfp. in fact, the wild-type tubby domain was found to have high enough affinity that it did not show agonist-induced responses in many cells prompting the authors to create a mutant  with a reduced affinity that was found useful in their studies  <cit> . interestingly, in the cells used in our studies the same mutation completely eliminated the membrane localization of the tubby domain  making it unsuitable for further studies. we did not have an explanation for this discrepancy other than the different fluorescent proteins used in the two studies and that the placing of the fluorescent protein relative to the tubby domain was different. quinn et al. used eyfp, while we used egfp fusion constructs and we used gfp in front of the tubby domain whereas the quinn study found the mutant tubby construct having yfp at its c-terminus a more suitable one. since the dimerization tendency of yfp is larger than that of gfp  <cit>  it is possible that the higher apparent affinity of the constructs in the quinn study reflects a dimerization of the fusion proteins, which could explain these differences. indeed, when we generated the same tubby domain constructs fused to yfp  we found that the r332h mutant did show some membrane localization, especially in cos- <dig> cells but not as much as shown in the quinn study . although this slight localization does not match those described by quinn et al., the higher dimerization tendency of yfp still may play into the apparent affinity of the mutant tubby construct.

nevertheless, a higher affinity of the full-length tubby protein  to the membrane was also shown in the nelson study and manifested as a rightward shift  in the dose-response curve with muscarinic agonist measuring the translocation of the tubby protein from the membrane to the cytosol. our results are in good agreement with these studies as we also found a significantly higher fraction of the tubby domain at the pm than with plcδ1ph, and documented a substantial difference between the agonist-sensitivities of the tubby domain and plcδ1ph-gfp translocation responses. moreover, our frap analysis showed that the dissociation of the tubby domain from the membrane is significantly slower than that of the plcδ1ph-gfp.

all three studies showed that tubby domain  displayed no sensitivity to insp <dig> in agreement with the original claims  <cit> . the present study also showed it with direct binding assays using recombinant tubby domains. quinn et al. showed that diffusion of insp <dig> into the patch pipette caused no translocation of the tubby domain mutant, while making the plcδ1ph-gfp fully translocate to the cytosol  <cit> . the nelson study, on the other hand, used overexpression of an insp <dig> 3-kinase to limit insp <dig> increases as described in their earlier studies  <cit> . they found that in contrast to plcδ1ph-gfp, the tubby domain translocation after agonist stimulation was insensitive to insp <dig> 3-kinase overexpression  <cit> . however, any reduction in insp <dig> increase  also reduces the ca2+ signal and as a corollary will limit plc activation. this was most likely the case in the quinn study where overexpression of the insp <dig> 5-phosphatase eliminated the translocation responses of both ptdinsp <dig> probes  <cit> . this study also found that the tubby domain translocation was slightly more sensitive to inhibition by ca2+ depletion than that of the plcδ1ph construct. this finding agreed with our observation that the tubby domain had a slower response to the cytoplasmic ca2+ increase than the plcδ1ph-gfp, consistent with an increased "resistance" of the tubby-domain-covered ptdinsp <dig> to plc-mediated hydrolysis. it is worth noting that both the quinn study and ours used hek <dig> cells.

in contrast to these findings, a striking reduction was observed in neuroblastoma cells in the translocation responses of the plcδ1ph domain, but not those of the tubby protein, when insp <dig> 3-kinase was expressed, with a strong reduction in the cytoplasmic ca2+ response  <cit> . this seemingly contradicted the higher ca2+ requirement of the tubby domain translocation also observed in that same study. one possible explanation for this apparent contradiction is, if the magnitudes of insp <dig> increases are much larger in the neuronal cells used in the nelson study than those observed in hek <dig> cells. this is not an unreasonable assumption, since n1e- <dig> neuroblastoma cells require much higher insp <dig> increases to induce ca2+ signaling than other cell types  <cit> . in search of an explanation for this unique feature, watras et al. has identified a protein in neurons that binds the insp <dig> receptor to significantly decrease its insp <dig> sensitivity  <cit> . this could make neuroblastoma cells  less sensitive to insp <dig> increases requiring them to generate a lot more insp <dig> in response to agonists that could significantly displace the plcδ1ph-gfp from the pm. additionally, any change in the relative proportion of ptdinsp <dig> vs. insp <dig> can contribute to a larger insp <dig> sensitivity of the plcd1ph translocation as demonstrated in mathematical modeling studies  <cit> .

the question remains whether the tighter binding of the tubby domain to the membrane is related to its lower affinity to insp <dig>  a significant amount of free insp <dig> present in the cytosol could indeed partially displace the plcδ1ph-gfp from the membrane while not affecting the binding of the tubby domain. however, overexpression of either the insp <dig> kinase  <cit> , the insp <dig> 5-phosphatase  <cit>  or an insp <dig> binding domains had little if any impact on the basal localization of the plcδ1ph-gfp. moreover, the slightest increases in free insp <dig> are immediately detected by the insp3-r in the form of ca2+ release. therefore, we do not favor an explanation that assumes significant free insp <dig> levels in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells. we would rather assume that the tighter binding of the tubby domain to the membrane reflects a genuinely higher affinity either to ptdinsp <dig> itself, or to the lipid together with some additional membrane component. this is consistent with the slower dissociation rate as well as the stronger resistance of the ptdinsp <dig> pool covered with the tubby domain to respond to plc activation. the fact that the 32p-phosphate or -myo-inositol labeled hek293-at <dig> cells  lose about 80-90% of their labeled ptdinsp <dig> within  <dig> sec of stimulation with  <dig> nm angii  <cit> , yet the tubby domain responds only in a fraction of cells stimulated with the same dose of agonist, suggest that the tubby domain probably underestimates the changes in ptdinsp <dig> because of its interference with plc activation p <dig> that is not bound to the tubby domain). therefore, while the plcδ1ph domain may overestimate plc activation because of its insp <dig> sensitivity, the tubby domain may underestimate it because of its higher apparent ptdinsp <dig> affinity. in fact, in the cells used in these studies , the inhibitory effects of the two domains on ca2+ signaling were very comparable: in one case due to the combined effects on insp <dig> quenching and ptdinsp <dig> binding , while in the other case because of a tighter ptdinsp <dig> binding . the slight delay in the onset of ca2+ rise caused by the expression of the plcδ1ph-mrfp but not the mrfp-tubby domain is certainly another indication that the plcδ1ph domain binds insp <dig>  importantly, we did not see a significant difference between the two domains in their sensitivity to expression of insp <dig> buffering constructs, essentially both being affected probably due to interference with the ca2+ signal.

an important observation of the present study was the delayed tubby response relative to that of the plcδ1ph domain during plc activation but not when the 5-phosphatase was recruited to the pm. this finding may simply suggest that the insp <dig> increase does indeed contribute to plcδ1ph translocation. however, it is also possible that the endogenous plc activation mechanism is more sensitive to masking of ptdinsp <dig> by the tubby domain than the catalysis by the recruited 5-phosphatase. the fact that the tubby domain does not bind the soluble headgroup, insp <dig>  even though it binds ptdinsp <dig> with higher affinity, already suggests that the binding force of the tubby domain must receive significant contributions from interactions with the glycerol backbone. if this were indeed the case, the tubby domain would obscure the phosphodiester group more and with that could block the access of plc to this site.

lastly, these studies have shown a perfect example of how the same lipid, ptdinsp <dig> can regulate several effectors in the same cell simultaneously and yet differently. just by having two different apparent affinities of two reporters used in the present study - mimicking two endogenous binding partners - is sufficient to elicit a differential response to the same plc activation. this was also convincingly demonstrated in the experiments where the kir <dig>  katp channel  <cit>  or the kcnq m-channel  <cit>  p <dig> regulated k+ channels) responses were correlated with ptdinsp <dig> changes assessed by the fluorescent reporters.

there are several other conclusions highlighted by these studies. firstly, all probes based on binding to ptdinsp <dig>  show some bias depending on its affinity to the lipid. secondly, the experimental system may also determine the extent to which the probe manifests its limitation. thirdly, even the fluorescent protein used a fusion partner can modify the utility of a bioprobe. these should be all reminders that we need to be cautious of selecting a probe and consider it as "the" gold standard.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study analyzed a set of ptdinsp <dig> reporters some selected from yeast ph domains and one comprising of the tubby domain of the transcription factor, tubby. all of these fluorescent probes confirmed that ptdinsp <dig> shows highest abundance in the pm and that this lipid is undetectable in intracellular membranes. most of the yeast-derived ph domains were found less useful, some expressing at low levels or showing weak membrane localization, others causing membrane blebbing, detailed comparison of the plcδ1ph-gfp and the tubby domain showed that both reporters are suitable to follow ptdinsp <dig> changes in living cells, but the tubby domain is less sensitive because of its higher affinity to ptdinsp <dig>  plcδ1ph domain was found to be the most sensitive reporter but because of its binding to insp <dig> some of its translocation is caused by insp <dig> increases that can become a problem especially in certain cell types. the differential responses of the two domains to ptdinsp <dig> changes helps us understand and envision the principles of inositide regulation of multiple effectors.
