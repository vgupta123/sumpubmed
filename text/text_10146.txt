BACKGROUND
most of the disease resistance genes cloned from plant species encode nucleotide-binding site  and leucine-rich repeat  domains. the nbs-lrr encoding genes are often called disease resistance genes , since their main functions are protecting plants from pathogens with only a few exceptions, such as chs <dig>  a tir-nbs-lrr-lim encoding gene, playing role in cold stress and adr <dig>  a cc-nb-lrr encoding gene, involved in drought tolerance
. the r-genes belong to a large gene family, with dozens or hundreds of copies in a genome
. the r proteins are composed of a variable n terminus, a conserved central nbs domain and a c-terminus with various number of short lrr motifs
 <cit> . the n terminus usually has a toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  motif or a coiled-coil  motif
 <cit> . the nbs domains can bind and hydrolyze atp or gtp, which are involved in signaling leading to pathogen resistance
 <cit> . the lrr domains are most likely to be involved in recognition specificity
 <cit> .

r-genes tend to be clustered in plant genomes
 <cit> . many r-gene sub-families were shown to have been under diversifying selection, particularly at the hyper-variable solvent-exposed residues in the lrr region
 <cit> . consequently, r-genes represent the most divergent gene families in plant genomes
 <cit> . besides diversifying selection, frequent sequence exchanges among homologues have also contributed to the high divergence of r-gene families in plants
 <cit> . however, r-genes vary dramatically in frequency of sequence exchanges. some r-genes, termed type i r-genes, had frequent sequence exchanges with homologues, resulting in extensive chimeric structures
 <cit> . frequent sequence exchanges may completely abolished allelic relationship of type i r-genes from different genotypes. different genotypes of the same species may harbor a various set of chimeric r-genes , leading to enormous distinct r-gene sequences in a population
 <cit> . in contrast to the type i r-genes, some r-genes  do not recombine with paralogues and are highly conserved in different genotypes of a species or closely related species. however, some type ii r-genes were found to be frequently lost in some genotypes, exhibiting presence/absence polymorphism
 <cit> . the mechanism underlying the differentiation of above two distinct evolutionary patterns for r-genes remains unknown.

the resistance gene i <dig> in tomato  encodes resistance against race  <dig> of the fusarium wilt pathogen fusarium oxysporum f sp lycopersici
 <cit> . the i <dig> gene is a member of a gene cluster located on chromosome  <dig> of tomato. the i <dig> protein is a typical cc-type r protein. a resistance trait against tomato yellow leaf curve virus  was also mapped in the vicinity of the i <dig> locus though it remains unclear whether the trait is encoded by a i <dig> homologue
 <cit> . i <dig> homologues are found in the syntenic region of potato ; two resistance genes  against potato late blight have been cloned from this region of potato
 <cit> ; and at least nine additional r-genes against potato late blight were mapped to this locus, which harbors dozens of i <dig> homologues
 <cit> . the r3a and r3b from potato exhibit 88% and 80% nucleotide identity with the i <dig> gene from tomato,respectively. i <dig> homologues were also found at the corresponding region in pepper , and this locus may represent the most important r-gene locus in solanaceae
 <cit> . previous studies of the i <dig> locus mainly focused on the cloning of functional r-genes, but the structure, evolution and gene content of the entire cluster remain unclear.

r-genes are believed to be physiologically toxic to plant cells and their expression is usually kept at low level when no pathogens exist
 <cit> . some r-genes are up-regulated when challenged by pathogens
 <cit> . one mechanism to keep r-gene at low level in absence of pathogen is through mirna mediated gene silencing
 <cit> . some r-genes could be cleaved by 22-nt mirnas and successfully produce secondary small interfering rnas  in a phased fashion . the resistance gene r3a from potato was shown to be cleaved by 22-nt mir <dig> family and produce phasirna
 <cit> . whether the i <dig> family from tomato is regulated by mir <dig> or other mirnas remains unknown.

in this study, we analyzed the structure and evolution of the i <dig> locus in tomato, and compared it with that in potato. first, i <dig> homologues were cloned from several genotypes of cultivated and wild tomato, including genotypes with resistance against tylcv. their evolution was investigated in detail through sequence analysis of i <dig> homologues from multiple genotypes of tomato, potato, pepper and tobacco. the mirnas targeting i <dig> homologues in potato and tomato were investigated and compared. the role of mirnas on r-gene expansion was discussed. the comprehensive study of the structure of the i <dig> locus may facilitate the cloning and the use of r-genes located in this region, and the evolutionary study may shed light on the mechanism of r-gene expansion in a genome.

methods
tomato materials used in this study
since resistance gene ty- <dig> against tylcv was genetically mapped to the i <dig> locus, a commercial tomato hybrid cultivar hongxiaoli with ty- <dig> was included in this study. the hybrid was selfed and a f <dig> population with  <dig> individuals was generated. a homozygote ty-2/ty- <dig>  was obtained from the f <dig> population to represent the ty- <dig>  haplotype. similarly, a susceptible homozygote of ty- <dig> was identified to represent the susceptible ty- <dig>  haplotype. the f <dig> population was used to map i <dig> homologues from the t and t haplotypes. the t haplotype was introgressed into cultivated tomato from s. habrochaites
 <cit> . four additional s. habrochaites accessions, la <dig>  la <dig>  la <dig> and la <dig>  were also included in this study for i <dig> homologue analysis.

inoculation of tylcv and phenotyping
to phenotype above tomato genotypes on reaction to tylcv, seedlings of 4– <dig> leaf stages were inoculated with a tylcv agrobacterium infectious clone
 <cit> . inoculated seedlings were kept in a growth chamber under 16 h light/8 h dark cycle for a month before investigating symptom of tylcv .

pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of i2homologues
the tomato genomic dna were extracted from mature leaves of each genotypes using ctab method, and genomic dna were used as template to pcr amplify i <dig> homologues
 <cit> . nearly full-length  fragments of i <dig> homologues were amplified from aforementioned genotypes of tomato using a pair of degenerated primers , which were located at + <dig> and + <dig>  of the resistant gene i <dig>  respectively. pcr amplification was in a 25 μl reaction with  <dig> unit fast pfu taq , treated for  <dig> mins at 95°c, followed by 32 cycles at 95°c for 30 s, 52°c for 30 s, and a final extension at 72°c for  <dig>  min. pcr products were gel purified using gel purification kit  and ligated into vector pzero <dig> using ta cloning kit . individual colonies were sequenced until no new genes were obtained in the last ten colones. if sequences from different clones have higher than  <dig> % nucleotide identity, they were considered to be derived from the same gene. the i <dig> homologues amplified from an accession were named as accession name followed by “i2” then by a number, such as la1777-i2- <dig>  i <dig> homologues from the t and t haplotypes were named as t-i2- and t-i2- followed by a number, respectively.table  <dig>

sequence analysis
four i <dig> homologues , i2c- <dig> , i2c- <dig> , i2c- <dig> ], originated from wild tomato species s. pimpinellifilium were downloaded from genbank
 <cit> . two partial genes i2c- <dig> and i2c- <dig> were excluded from this study. the sequences of r3a , r3b  and sixteen i <dig> homologues  from potato genotype sh83-92- <dig> were retrieved from genbank and named as sh-i2- followed by a number
 <cit> . the i <dig> homologue  from s. bulbocastanum was named as sb-i2- <dig>  and the one  from s. stoloniferum as ss-i2- <dig> 

using blastn method, i <dig> homologues  were retrieved from the sequenced tomato genotype heinz 1706
 <cit>  and the sequenced potato genotype dm
 <cit> . they were named as hz-i2- and dm-i2- followed by a number, respectively. sequences were aligned using program muscle
 <cit>  and manually edited in genedoc . neighbor-joining  trees  with bootstrap values  were constructed using mega  <dig> 
 <cit> . gene conversions among homologues were detected using geneconv
 <cit>  with the default settings and confirmed visually. dot plot analysis between two sequences was performed using program dotter
 <cit> .

mapping of the i2homologues in the t and t haplotypes
a f <dig> population with  <dig> individuals was used to map the i <dig> homologues from the t and t haplotypes. first, primers specific to each i <dig> homologue were designed . a primer pair was considered as specific only when the target gene but none of the other genes in the t and t haplotypes was amplified by this primer combination. the gene-specific primers were used as markers to screen the f <dig> population and their linkage with caps markers m- <dig> and m- <dig> at the i <dig> locus were analyzed.

identification of mirnas targeting i2homologues
to detect mirnas that potentially target i <dig> homologues, sequences of all i <dig> homologues were first used as query to screen for matching small rnas  from database somart 
 <cit> . identified srnas with more than  <dig> reads in the database were further confirmed in the psrnatarget web server  using following parameters: maximum expectation =  <dig> , and target accessibility - allowed maximum energy to unpair the target site  =  <dig>  all confirmed matching srnas were mapped to tomato genome using bowtie
 <cit> . then, approximately 800 bp flanking sequences of all confirmed matching srnas were extracted, and their fold-back structures were predicted using the rnafold program with default settings
 <cit> . a folding structure was assumed if there was a central loop and a stem  of at least 18 bp when folding energy no greater than 18 kcal/mol was used. then, the fold-back structures were evaluated using mircheck program with strict parameters: ≤ <dig> mismatches, ≤ <dig> bulged or asymmetrically unpaired nucleotides and ≤ <dig> continuous mismatches in the seed regions to meet the accepted criteria for mirna annotation
 <cit> .

the genomes of s. lycopersicum , s. tuberosum , nicotiana benthemiana , n. sylvestris , n. tomentosiformis , capsicum annuum , mimulus guttatus , vitis vinifera , carica papaya  and arabidopsis lyrata  were chosen to analyze if they contain a certain mirna. first, a mature mirna sequence was downloaded from mirbase , then mapped into these genome sequences using bowtie. if a genome sequence had no more than  <dig> mismatches with a mirna sequence, its 800 bp flanking sequences were further investigated for stem-loop structure using program rnafold and evaluated using program mircheck as described above.

three mir <dig> hairpin sequences  were downloaded from mirbase . they were used as query sequence in blastn search of ten plant genomes, and significant hits  were retrieved for further analysis.

mapping of mrna cleavage sites in i2homologues
total rnas were isolated from leaves of tomato hongxiaoli plantlets using rnaiso plus  and was purified with rna cleanup kit . to map the mirna cleavage site in i <dig> homologues, modified 5′- race was performed using generacer kit  as described previously
 <cit> . first, approximately 5 μg total rna was ligated with the generacer rna oligo adapter . then, generacer oligo dt primer or conserved i <dig> primer was used to synthesize the first strand cdna
 <cit> . a degenerate primer  was designed in regions conserved in most tomato i <dig> homologues to pair with generacer™ 5′ primer to amplify pcr products using the synthesized cdna as template. then, generacer™ 5′ nest primer and gene nested primers, race-p <dig> and race-p <dig>  were used for the first round nested pcr and second round nested pcr, respectively . the pcr products were gel purified using gel purification kit  and ligated into vector peasy-t <dig> using ta cloning kit . positive clones were sent for sequencing.

cleavage sites of tomato i <dig> homologues were also investigated using a degradome database using online program somart
 <cit> . first, a randomly chosen tomato i <dig> homologue was input into programs silcer detector and drna mapper. the output of these two programs was then analyzed by a third program smart compar.

RESULTS
the i2locus spans more than 5 mb on chromosome  <dig> of tomato and potato
using blastn method,  <dig> i <dig> homologues were discovered in the sequenced genome of tomato cultivar heinz  <dig>  nineteen of them are located at the i <dig> locus, in a  <dig>  mb region on chromosome  <dig>  of the remaining  <dig> homologues, five are from other chromosomes and  <dig> are on chromosome  <dig> but away from the i <dig> locus, and they were excluded from further analysis . the positions of i <dig> homologues and important genetic markers around the i <dig> locus of tomato heinz  <dig> are shown in figure 
 <dig> figure  <dig> 
dot plot analysis of the
i2
locus between tomato and potato. the vertical line represents the i <dig> locus in tomato cultivar heinz  <dig>  and the horizontal line represents the i <dig> locus in potato cultivar dm. the positions for nine sub-loci  and important markers are shown in both the horizontal and vertical lines. the numbers in brackets after the sub-locus name are the number of i <dig> homologues at corresponding positions. no large duplications were found, and duplications were mainly limited to the i <dig> sequences but not their flanking regions.



the sequenced genome of potato dm has  <dig> i <dig> homologues. of them,  <dig> are located in the syntenic region of the i <dig> locus of tomato, spanning a region of at least  <dig>  mb . fifteen i <dig> homologues are not on chromosome  <dig>  and three i <dig> homologues are on chromosome  <dig> but far away from the syntenic region of the i <dig> locus. therefore, the i <dig> locus was most likely expanded before the speciation of solanum and may have also experienced amplifications after speciation.

comparative analysis of the i2/r3locus in tomato and potato
to investigate structure variation between tomato and potato, the i <dig> locus of tomato heinz  <dig> was compared with that of the potato genotype dm. good co-linearity was found between tomato and potato, except in the centromeric part of the locus. however, the copy number of i <dig> homologues as well as their positions varies considerably between the two genomes .

based on the distribution patterns of i <dig> homologues, this locus can be further divided into  <dig> sub-loci . dot plot analysis indicated that the duplications resulting in the  <dig> sub-loci were limited to the i <dig> sequences but not their flanking regions, since sequences flanking these i <dig> homologues are unrelated . i <dig> homologues are presented at six sub-loci of both tomato and potato genomes, though their copy number may vary dramatically . at the other three sub-loci , i <dig> homologues are present in one but absent in the other genome, showing presence/absence divergence between the two species.

to investigate the genetic mechanism for such presence/absence divergence at the three sub-loci, their sequences were used to search the pepper genome. sequences from the syntenic regions of sub-loci  <dig> and  <dig> but not  <dig> were found in pepper genome. like in potato, the sub-locus  <dig> in pepper does not have any i <dig> homologues , suggesting that the i <dig> homologue at sub-locus  <dig> of tomato was most likely gained after speciation. on the other hand, potato might have lost i <dig> homologues at sub-locus  <dig> after speciation since pepper has i <dig> homologues at this sub-locus .figure  <dig>

i <dig> homologues  are present in tomato and pepper but absent in potato, suggesting that the i <dig> homologue at sub-locus  <dig> in potato were lost after speciation.



to study the evolution of i <dig> homologues from different sub-loci, a distance tree was constructed using approximately  <dig>  kb sequences of i <dig> homologues  from tomato , potato , pepper  and n. sylvestris  and n. tomentosiformis  . homologues hz-i2- <dig> and dm-i2- <dig>  which contain many unknown nucleotides, were excluded from further analysis. based on the tree, the i <dig> homologues from solanaceae can be classified into four major groups. one group contains i <dig> homologues from sub-loci  <dig> and  <dig> of pepper; one group contains all i <dig> homologues from sub-loci 1– <dig> of tomato and potato; and the other two groups contain i <dig> homologues from sub-loci  <dig> and  <dig> of potato and pepper as well as all i <dig> homologues from nicotiana. the phylogenetic tree suggests that all i <dig> homologues from nicotiana might be derived from sub-loci  <dig> and  <dig> in the common ancestor between solanum and nicotiana. the i <dig> homologues from sub-loci  <dig> and  <dig> of tomato are highly similar to those of potato, respectively. however, homologues in other sub-loci showed no obvious orthologous relationship between tomato and potato. the lack of orthologous relationship between i <dig> homologues in tomato and potato suggest that sequence exchanges may have occurred between homologues from different sub-loci after speciation of solanum.

sequencing i2homologues from different genotypes
to better understand the diversity and evolution of the i <dig> locus, i <dig> homologues were cloned from six tomato genotypes, including the t and t haplotypes , and four wild genotypes of s. habrochaites . inoculation with the infectious tylcv clone showed that la <dig> is resistant to tylcv, consistent with previous 
CONCLUSIONS
 <cit> , while the other three wild genotypes are susceptible. to clone the i <dig> homologues from these genotypes, a pair of degenerated primers  was designed from the conserved regions of i <dig> homologues . their pcr products were cloned and individual colonies were sequenced. a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> colonies were sequenced, resulting in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> distinct sequences from the t and t haplotypes, s. habrochaites accessions la <dig>  la <dig>  la <dig> and la <dig>  respectively.

mapping of the i2homologues in the t and t haplotypes
the  <dig> and  <dig> i <dig> homologues obtained from the t and t haplotypes were genetically mapped using a f <dig> segregating population  derived from the hybrid cultivar hongxiaoli. first, markers m- <dig> and m- <dig>  which flank the i <dig> locus, were used to screen for recombinants. a total of  <dig> recombinants were obtained from the 736 f <dig> individuals. specific primers were successfully designed for six of the  <dig> i <dig> homologues from the t and t haplotypes, and all of them were fine mapped to sub-loci 5– <dig> of the i <dig> locus .figure  <dig> 
distance tree of
i2
homologues from different genotypes of tomato. the  <dig> i <dig> homologues from tomato form five clades, supported by high bootstrap numbers. members in clades i, iii and v are evenly related homologues, and are extensive chimeras. members within clades ii and iv are highly conserved homologues from different genotypes. the first part of the gene name represents accession/cultivar name, and the numbers in bracket  show gene’s position . genes from the same genotype spread in the tree. numbers on nodes are bootstrap values, and values < <dig> are not shown.



different evolutionary patterns for i2homologues
the  <dig> nearly full-length i <dig> homologues obtained above were combined with the  <dig> i <dig> homologues  from heinz  <dig> and four homologues from wild species s. pimpinellifilium for further analysis  . a distance tree of the  <dig> i <dig> homologues showed five distinguishable clades . members from clade ii and iv are highly conserved, with all pair-wise nucleotide identities > <dig> %. each genotype/haplotype usually has one representative in clades ii and iv, and members within each clade are most likely alleles/orthologues. the exceptions are two i <dig> homologues from la <dig> in clade iv, and two i <dig> homologues from la <dig> and la <dig> in clade ii, respectively. the presence of two highly similar sequences is most likely due to the heterozygosity of the i <dig> locus in these genotypes, which are self-incompatible. only a few sequence exchanges were detected in clades ii and iv, and mainly occurred between alleles . therefore, clades ii and iv have evolved independently from other homologues at the i <dig> locus, with an evolutionary pattern similar to that of type ii r-genes
 <cit> .

in contrast, the other three clades in figure 
 <dig> usually have multiple copies from one genotype and the average pair-wise nucleotide identity within a clade varies from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. homologues within a clade are often equally related with each other and do not show obvious allelic/orthologous relationship. high sequence diversity and lack of allelic/orthologous relationship might have been attributed to frequent sequence exchanges among homologues
 <cit> . to test above hypothesis, sequence exchanges were analyzed for all i <dig> homologues in tomato using software geneconv, and a total of  <dig> sequence exchanges were detected. the length of the sequence exchange tracts varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, with an average of 533 bp. of them,  <dig> sequence exchanges occurred among members within a clade  . clade i has homologues from three sub-loci , and sequence exchanges happened between homologues from different loci. the frequent sequence exchanges and extensive chimeric structures suggest that the i <dig> homologues in clades i and v have an evolutionary pattern of type i r-genes
 <cit> .

sequence exchanges occasionally occurred between type i and type ii i2homologues or between different lineages of type i genes
eleven sequence exchanges were detected between genes from different clades. a sequence exchange of 162 bp was detected between la1740-i2- <dig> from clade i and three members  from clade ii . the three members from clade ii have identical sequences in the exchange tract. it is unlikely that the three genes had independent sequence exchanges in the same region. it is most likely that a 162 bp sequence of la1740-i2- <dig> converted gene la1740-i2- <dig>  since these two genes are from the same genotype . similarly, gene la1777-i2- <dig> from clade ii converted gene t-i2- <dig> from clade i. sequence exchanges might also occur between different lineages of type i genes, such as between genes hz-i2- <dig> from clade i and t-i2- <dig> from clade iii. interestingly, the directions of above sequence exchanges were unilaterally from type ii genes to type i genes or between different lineages of type i genes, but never from type i genes to type ii genes.

rare sequence exchanges among i2homologues in potato
similar analyses  were applied to i <dig> homologues in potato. a total of  <dig> i <dig> homologues  were obtained from genbank, mainly from the sequenced genome of dm and the r3a haplotype of the diploid s. tuberosum . three of them are not from the i <dig> locus and one has too many missing data, and they were excluded from further sequence analysis. a distance tree was constructed for the remaining  <dig> potato i <dig> homologues, and seven tomato homologues including i <dig>  i2c- <dig> and one from each clade in figure 
 <dig> were included for comparison. consistent with their locations shown in figure 
 <dig>  all i <dig> homologues from tomato are grouped together with homologues from sub-loci 1– <dig> of potato . the homologues from clade i in figure 
 <dig> are quite divergent  but evenly related. seven sequence exchanges were detected among the  <dig> i <dig> homologues from potato in clade i . such pattern is in striking contrast to that for the i <dig> homologues from tomato, in which i <dig> homologues were differentiated into several groups, including both type i and type ii genes . no obvious differentiation  among potato i <dig> homologues and occasional sequence exchanges suggest that the i <dig> homologues in sub-loci 1– <dig> in potato represent an ancient lineage of type i genes that were originated at least  <dig> mya before the divergence of tomato and potato
 <cit> .figure  <dig> 
distance tree of

homologues from potato. seven representative i <dig> homologues from tomato are included, which are all grouped into clade i. genes with name “dm-i2-” are from potato cultivar dm; genes with name “sh-i2-” are from s. tuberosum; genes with name “hz-i2-” are from tomato heinz  <dig>  numbers on nodes are bootstrap values, and values < <dig> are not shown.



the homologues from sub-loci  <dig> and  <dig> of potato form four clades  in figure 
 <dig>  ten and two sequence exchanges were detected among members in clade ii and clade v, respectively. members within these two clades exhibited  <dig> % and  <dig> % average nucleotide identity, respectively. sequence exchanges among members of each clade and high diversity of i <dig> homologues suggest that clades ii and v represent two distinct lineages of type i i <dig> homologues
 <cit> . the evolutionary pattern of clade iii and iv remains unclear because only two sequences were obtained from this study.

identification of mirnas for the i2homologues
the resistance gene r3a from potato was shown to be targeted by members of 22-nt mir <dig> family
 <cit> . computational analysis showed that i <dig> homologues from tomato may also be targeted by mir <dig> family, which has about  <dig> reads per million from three tissues  of tomato . to investigate if i <dig> homologues from tomato are targeted by other mirnas, the tomato srna libraries  were first searched using  <dig> i <dig> homologues. consequently, a total of  <dig>  distinct srnas, including the 22-nt sly-mir <dig>  were found in the srna database when five mismatches were allowed. sly-mir <dig> was previously shown to regulate the expression of r-gene tm- <dig> in tomato
 <cit> . to investigate if sly-mir <dig> also target the i <dig> homologues, modified rna ligase-mediated 5′-race was performed
 <cit> . sequencing the pcr products showed that the mrnas of at least one i <dig> homologue from cultivar hongxiaoli were cleaved at the predicted targeting site of mir <dig> . however, no cleavage product was detected at the predicted target site of mir <dig>  therefore, the i <dig> homologues from tomato are targeted by mir <dig> and may not be targeted by mir <dig>  the cleavage of mir <dig> on i <dig> homologues was also confirmed in a degradome database of tomato. fourteen partial i <dig> cdnas were identified in the database. one of partial ones starts from the 485th nucleotide of gene t-i2- <dig>  confirming the cleavage function of mir <dig> .figure  <dig> 
cleavage sites of mir <dig> and two tasirnas in gene
t-i2-3
. the 22 nt mir <dig> has three mismatches with gene t-i2- <dig>  the blocks of 21 nt  show the tasirnas triggered by mir <dig>  and the 6th-14th tasirnas were omitted as indicated by “//”. the arrow in t-i2- <dig> matching the mir <dig> sequence shows the cleavage site of mir <dig>  evidenced by race-pcr and degradome analysis. the arrows in the third  and 15th  tasirnas are most likely the cleavage sites of tasirnas.




the targeting site of sly-mir <dig> encodes the 206th – 213th amino acids in the i <dig> protein, partially overlapping with the conserved p loop. this sequence is highly conserved in all i <dig> homologues in tomato and potato. we hypothesize that mir <dig> regulate expression of most, if not all i <dig> homologues in tomato, which may facilitate its expansion in a genome.

mir <dig> triggers 21-nt phased sirna from i2homologues
it was shown that 22-nt mirnas often trigger the biogenesis of secondary phased sirna
 <cit> . to investigate if mir <dig> can trigger phasirna, small rnas from tomato were analyzed using program somart
 <cit> . a total of  <dig> srnas were successfully mapped to a representative i <dig> homologue . they were predominantly 21-nt in length and with 5′ u residue, consistent with the features of tasirna
 <cit> . most of them were mapped to the downstream of the cleavage site of mir <dig> with a phased pattern . the structure of these srnas and their phasing with the mir <dig> cleavage site indicated that they were tasirnas triggered by the 22-nt mirna <dig> 

race-pcr and degradome database were used to investigate the potential regulating effects of tasirnas. three potential cleavage sites of phasirna were identified. a degraded mrna of gene t-i2- <dig> starting at 579th nucleotide and a degraded mrna of gene t-i2- <dig> starting at 540th nucleotide, were obtained using race-pcr strategy . these two degraded mrna were most likely the cleavage products of tasirnas  since their cleavage points are located in the middle of a tasirna triggered by the mirna <dig> . in addition, a degradome rna from tomato degradome database was most likely generated by phasirna 3′s <dig> .

mir <dig> was originated after the divergence of solanaceae
to gain insight into the evolution of mir <dig> in plants, four members of the mir <dig> family were downloaded from mirbase  including sly-mir <dig> from tomato, nta-mir <dig> from tobacco, stu-mir6024-3p and stu-mir6024-5p from potato. in addition, whole genome sequences of ten plant species were chosen to identify mir <dig> genes using bioinformatic approach . the mir <dig> sequences were used to blast search the ten genomes, and significant hits were found in eight of the ten plant species except in c. papaya and a. lyrata. however, the flanking sequences of the significant hits in m. guttatus and v. vinifera could not form hairpin structure, and therefore these two species do not have mir <dig>  all the six solanaceae species have the mir <dig> sequence and its flanking sequences  can form a predicted hairpin structure. the mir <dig> gene has no similarity with i <dig> homologues except that the mir6024/mir6024* can match the target site in i <dig> homologues. therefore, the mir <dig> was not originated from duplication and inversion of i <dig> sequences
 <cit> . the 22-nt mature mir <dig> was confirmed in a pepper srna database . however, point mutations were observed in the mir6024* region of n. sylvestris and n. benthemiana, and it remains unclear if these mutations affect the biogenesis of mir <dig> in the two species . since mir <dig> is present in distantly related species in solanaceae, we hypothesize that the mir <dig> was originated in the common ancestor of the solanaceae family.figure  <dig>

discussion
divergence of i2locus among different solanaceae species
the i <dig> locus is a hotspot for r-genes, with several qualitative resistance traits  and quantitative resistance traits mapped to this locus. a good understanding of the structure and evolution of this locus will facilitate the cloning and efficient use of r-genes from this region.

the i <dig> locus contains multiple homologues and spans several megabases on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> in solanum. the i <dig> homologues in this region form nine well-separated sub-cluster . the sub-loci and their expansion were caused by duplication of individual i <dig> homologues, since there was no evidence of large  duplications in this region. the duplication frequency of i <dig> homologues might have varied considerably since different species show a large variation in i <dig> copy number in different sub-loci. our data showed that deletions also accounted for part of the i <dig> locus divergence between different species .

i <dig> homologues from the centromeric part of the i <dig> locus were grouped into one clade in the phylogenetic tree of all i <dig> homologues from solanum, while homologues from sub-loci  <dig> and  <dig> formed four clades . the five clades are equally related with each other, suggesting that they were differentiated at similar time. after differentiation, the homologues from the centromeric part of the i <dig> locus duplicated and generated the sub-loci 1– <dig> 

the structure of i2locus from the ty-2haplotype and s. habrochaitesla1777
the resistance gene ty- <dig> against tylcv in cultivated tomato was introgressed from s. habrochiates accession“b6013”
 <cit> . the recombination at the i <dig> locus of the ty- <dig> haplotype was shown to be highly suppressed
 <cit> . recombination suppression is possibly caused by inversion  in this region that may prevent pairing between homologous chromosomes. it remains unclear if such chromosome change also exists in any genotypes susceptible to tylcv. if such susceptible genotypes are identified, they can be crossed with the ty- <dig> haplotype and the resistance trait can be fine mapped.

four accessions of s. habrochiates were included in this study for analysis of i <dig> homologues. the number of i <dig> homologues and their sequences seem to vary considerably between different accessions, showing large diversity at this locus. one of the four accessions, accession la <dig>  was resistant against strain tylcv-cyprus
 <cit>  and tolerance to tylcv strains from sardinia and senegal
 <cit> . different copy numbers of i <dig> homologues in the t haplotype  and accession la <dig> , and no highly similar pairs of genes in the two haplotypes , suggest that they have different i <dig> locus, consistent with a previous report that the tylcv resistance in la <dig> is not encoded by ty- <dig> but by several recessive loci
 <cit> .

sequence exchanges among i2homologues
all i <dig> homologues from sub-loci 1– <dig> in potato were evenly related with each other, similar to the feature of type i r-genes. however, unlike type i r-genes, these homologues showed infrequent sequence exchanges, and they are not extensive chimeras though occasional sequence exchanges were detected among them. the presence of a large number of divergent but evenly related homologues and infrequent sequence exchanges suggested that the i <dig> homologues from sub-loci 1– <dig> of the i <dig> locus in potato are type i r-genes. they are mingled with tomato i <dig> homologues from sub-loci 1– <dig> in phylogenetic tree , suggesting that this lineage of type i genes in potato had existed before the divergence of tomato and potato  <dig> mya
 <cit> .

the i <dig> homologues in sub-loci 1– <dig> in tomato, on the other hand, were diverged into five well-supported clades . genes physically linked are not necessarily closely related. for example, the genes located in sub-locus  <dig> were grouped into two different clades . members from clade i in figure 
 <dig> showed extensive chimeric structures resulted from frequent sequence exchanges; they are evenly related with each other, with most pair-wise nucleotide identity of  <dig> - <dig> %. above features are typical of type i r-genes
 <cit> . in contrast, genes within clades ii and iv are highly conserved and each genotype has only one representative. interestingly, rare sequence exchanges were also found between members from different clades. we conclude that the i <dig> homologues from sub-loci 1– <dig> of tomato has started to differentiate. some groups have evolutionary patterns of type i while others have evolutionary patterns of type ii r-genes. in contrast, the sub-loci 1– <dig> from potato did not have such differentiation and maintained as one lineage of type i genes. such variation on the organization and evolution of the i <dig> homologues between tomato and potato, which diverged from their last common ancestor approximately  <dig> mya
 <cit> , showed that the evolutionary pattern of r-genes may change dramatically within a relatively short evolutionary time.

i <dig> homologues from sub-locus  <dig> of potato were grouped into two different clades . furthermore, the homologues from these two clades are interwoven at sub-locus  <dig>  members of different lineages of the r <dig> resistance gene are also interwoven in the r <dig> resistance gene cluster in potato similar to the organization of the r <dig> resistance gene family in potato
 <cit> . the interweaving organization of members from different clades suggests that physical proximity is not the main factor for the differentiation of type i and type ii r-genes
 <cit> .

mirnas targeting i2homologues
r-genes, though critical for the survival of plants, may pose threats to plant fitness if accumulated to a high copy number
 <cit> . to reduce their fitness cost, r-genes are often kept at low level of expression. one mechanism for down-regulating the expression of r-genes is through mirnas, which were recently shown to cleave r-genes and generate tasirnas
 <cit> . in addition to the mir <dig> family targeting i <dig> homologues in potato
 <cit> , we identified and confirmed that mir <dig> targets i <dig> family in tomato. search of the tomato degradome confirmed the cleavage function of mir <dig> and also suggest the cleavage function of tasirnas triggered by mirnas . the mir <dig> family has high expression level in three tissues of potato  , while mir <dig> family has a much lower expression in tomato  . mir <dig> was found in distantly related genus  in solanaceae, and therefore it was most likely originated in the common ancestor of solanaceae. mir <dig> was shown to be an ancient mirna
 <cit> . however, no cleavage of i <dig> homologues by mir <dig> was confirmed in tomato though the mir <dig> does exist in tomato genome. therefore, the collective regulation by mir <dig>  mir <dig> as well as tasirnas triggered by them may control the expression level of i <dig> homologues in solanaceae, and the down-regulation of the i <dig> homologues by these mirnas may make the expansion of i <dig> homologues less costly in fitness. though silenced by mirnas, these r-genes can exercise their full resistance function when challenged by pathogens such as viruses and fungi, which can suppress the silencing machinary of host plants
