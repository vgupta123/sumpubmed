BACKGROUND
candida spp. are the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections  <cit> , and candida albicans accounts for approximately 50% of cases of candidemia  <cit> . frequently, candidemia is associated with c. albicans colonization of indwelling devices, such as catheters, endotracheal tubes, and pacemakers  <cit> . in fact, c. albicans is the most common fungus in biofilms formed on medical devices  <cit> . biofilm formation is a complex, multicellular process, consisting of cell adhesion, growth, morphogenic switching between yeast and filamentous states, and quorum sensing  <cit> . adhesion of c. albicans cells to materials or host cells is a prerequisite for biofilm formation, and cell-cell interactions may be important in the hierarchical organization of cells within the biofilm  <cit> . moreover, biofilm formation of c. albicans is governed by a tightly woven gene network composed of six transcription regulators and their target genes  <cit> . the zinc finger transcription factor bcr <dig> and its target genes, als <dig>  als <dig>  hwp <dig>  and ece <dig>  play an important role, especially in the process of adhesion  <cit> .

human serum  is a complex medium composed of proteins, lipids, and small molecules. the interaction of c. albicans with serum has been of long-standing interest in the field of fungal pathogenesis. because candida spp. can form biofilms on intravenous catheters and other inserted medical devices that may come into contact with blood, serum is regarded as an external cue to trigger biofilm formation. yuthika et al. <cit>  reported that 3% human serum can promote the formation of c. albicans biofilms. however, other researches revealed that serum can inhibit biofilm formation in some bacteria. another study showed that human serum and fetal bovine serum  inhibit biofilm formation in staphylococcus aureus <cit> , and hammond et al. <cit>  found that adult bovine serum  or adult human serum  also inhibits p. aeruginosa biofilm formation on plastic surfaces, including intravenous catheters. some studies revealed the ability of serum components to prevent the formation of bacterial biofilms. it was reported that bovine serum albumin  caused a significant decrease in biofilm development  <cit> . abraham et al. indicated that a low molecular weight component of human serum inhibits biofilm formation in staphylococcus aureus <cit> . in addition, one component of innate immunity also prevents bacterial biofilm development  <cit> .

therefore, our hypothesis is that the positive effect of human serum on candida albicans biofilm formation may be due to many factors, so it is necessary to study the related molecular mechanism.

RESULTS
the c. albicans adhesion process
to directly observe the adhesion process of c. albicans, the live cell movie analyzer was used. for the first  <dig> or 3 h of biofilm formation, we took photos once per minute by means of continuous photographic techniques. when those pictures were played back in rapid succession, we got dynamic images of biofilm growth. movie  <dig> shows that cells of c. albicans quickly adhered to the surface of polypropylene microtiter plates, formed germ tubes, and gradually extended in rpmi  <dig> without hs . however, in the rpmi  <dig> with 50% hs, the cells of the same strain kept a brownian motion at the beginning and could not quickly clung to the bottom of the plate. the brownian motion lasted as long as about 2 h. the motion did not stop until the formation of a large number of germ tubes . in the next hour , almost no c. albicans cells kept a brownian motion, but the hyphae grew longer . movie  <dig> further shows that brownian motion stops after 2 h .

effect of human serum on germ tube formation of c. albicans
c. albicans cells were cultured in rpmi  <dig> with and without 50% hs, and germ tube formation was continuously observed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 180-min time points by live cell movie analyzer. for the first 90 min of culture, the germ tube formation rate of c. albicans cells in the experimental group  was significantly lower than that in the control group. over 2 h of incubation, there was no significant difference in the rate of germ tube formation between the two groups. with the further extension of incubation time , the amount of hyphae gradually increased in the experimental group, just as in the control group .

effect of human serum on c. albicans biofilms
data comparing biofilm growth of c. albicans strains in the absence or presence of different concentrations of hs were obtained using a xtt reduction assay. initially, the tests were performed using cells of strain atcc <dig> in rpmi  <dig> containing different concentrations of hs .

it was found that hs inhibited the biofilm formation of c. albicans in a dose-dependent manner . more specifically, 3% hs was sufficient to inhibit biofilm formation , and this anti-biofilm effect increased with increasing hs concentrations . however, hs had no significant inhibitory effect on pre-adhered c. albicans biofilms in vitro , even when the concentrations were as high as 50% .

to confirm the hypothesis that this effect was not specific to strain atcc <dig>  we tested three unrelated clinical strains and found that hs also had the same effect on all three clinical strains .

characterization of the inhibitory components
to further investigate the component of serum that affect the adhesion of c. albicans, we heated the serum at 56°c for 30 min. this heat treatment did not abrogate the inhibitory activity. heat-inactivated serum still inhibited biofilms in a dose-dependent manner . at a concentration of 3%, heat-inactivated hs significantly inhibited biofilm formation , and with increasing hs concentrations, the effect of hs on biofilm formation became more pronounced. to eliminate the possibility that a heat stable protein was responsible for the biofilm inhibition, proteinase k was used to degrade proteins in the hs, but this also did not affect the ability of serum to inhibit biofilm formation . biofilm formation was significantly reduced in proteinase k-treated serum compared with the control group . at a concentration of 3%, proteinase k-treated hs significantly inhibited biofilm formation , and with increasing hs concentrations, the effect of hs on biofilm formation became more pronounced. the results were similar in all four c. albicans strains .

effect of human serum on planktonic growth of c. albicans
to confirm that inhibition of biofilm formation was not due solely to growth inhibition, the effect of hs on the planktonic growth of c. albicans was investigated. time-growth curves indicated that the presence of 50% hs  did not significantly affect the growth of c. albicans  . to confirm the hypothesis that this effect was not specific to strain atcc <dig>  we tested three unrelated clinical strains and found that hs had the same effect on all three clinical strains as well .

effect of human serum on expression of adhesion-related genes
to elucidate the potential molecular mechanism behind the ability of hs to prevent growth of c. albicans biofilms, total rna was isolated from biofilms of four c. albicans strains grown in rpmi  <dig> medium with or without 50% hs at three time points . the expression levels of specific genes that were previously implicated in mediating the adhesion of c. albicans cells were determined by real-time rt-pcr. hs had varying effects on different genes in different tested strains , but the general trend of these genes was consistent. hs down-regulated the expression of the adhesion-related genes als <dig>  and als <dig> , but up-regulated the expression of the hypha-related genes hwp <dig>  and ece <dig>  at all three time points . particularly, expression levels of als <dig>  and als <dig>  showed significant differences at both 90 min and 24 h  . only at the 90-min time point were the transcription levels of hwp <dig>  and ece <dig>  significantly higher  . the transcription level of bcr <dig> was significantly higher at 90 min  , but bcr <dig> levels were significantly lower at both 60 min  and 24 h  .

discussion
to make the transition from a commensal organism to a systemic pathogen, c. albicans must first enter the bloodstream. it can do so by taking advantage of medical devices, such as intravenous catheters, to enter the bloodstream directly, or it can cross intact or damaged gastrointestinal mucosa and enter into the bloodstream  <cit> . in the bloodstream, c. albicans is exposed to the innate immune defenses. as a part of human innate immune system, serum and its components show different degrees of protection against systemic candidiasis.

in this study, the natural proliferation condition of c. albicans was monitored continuously by a live cell movie analyzer. c. albicans cells in hs moved with brownian motion in the initial stage of culture, then failed adhere to the surface of polystyrene plates. this indicates that c. albicans may remain in a suspended status at the early period of entering the blood stream. previous studies showed that free-flowing c. albicans can be rapidly cleared from the blood  <cit> . we determined that human serum facilitates the removal of c. albicans by inhibiting the adhesion of c. albicans on the surface of the endothelial cells. c. albicans possesses virulence factors that are needed to establish candidiasis that are involved in the many steps of this complicated process, such as adhesion, phenotypic switching, morphogenesis, and biofilm formation  <cit> . some factors in the bloodstream, such as temperature and serum, facilitate the filamentation of c. albicans <cit> . it is reported that filamentation is favorable for c. albicans adhesion and biofilm formation  <cit> . however, filamentation failed to offset the biofilm formation inhibition caused by the hs-induced adhesion defect, as demonstrated in our study.

we also investigated the effect of serum on germ tube formation in c. albicans. our results showed that the rate of germ tube formation is high in hs medium, but compared with the control group, germ tube formation in the experimental group was delayed in the initial stage of culture . this may be one of the reasons for hs-induced adhesion inhibition. based on these results, we also think that rpmi  <dig> medium may be a more suitable medium than human serum to conduct germ tube testing in c. albicans.

in the initial stage of biofilm culture , low serum concentrations suppressed c. albicans biofilm formation. however, the serum had no effect on pre-adhered biofilms , even if the serum was in a very high concentration. thus, we concluded that serum may inhibit biofilm formation by preventing the adhesion of c. albicans, in consensus with previous studies  <cit> . recent studies showed that addition of as little as 3% human serum to media can promote c. albicans biofilm formation  <cit> , contrary to our results. this may be explained by the use of different materials, such as serum, culture medium, strains, adhesive medium, and so on.

it has been reported that igg, ll- <dig>  transferrin and lactoferrin, at concentrations close to those found in vivo, can reduce the capacity of c. albicans and bacteria to adhere to polystyrene  <cit> . thus, we initially hypothesized that some protein or antimicrobial peptide in human serum may inhibit the adhesion of c. albicans, and as a consequence, reduce biofilm formation. however, our results suggest that the compound in serum that inhibits c. albicans biofilm formation is not proteinaceous. abraham et al. <cit>  found that a low molecular weight component of human serum inhibits biofilm formation in staphylococcus aureus, and the component was protease-resistant and heat stable. we conclude here that human serum may also contain non-protein component that can inhibit the adhesion and biofilm formation of fungi and bacteria. to confirm this hypothesis, future studies are needed to identify this component of human serum.

in this study, planktonic growth of c. albicans was not inhibited by human serum, indicating that inhibition of biofilm formation was not due solely to growth inhibition.

biofilm formation of c. albicans, a process that depends upon both cell-cell and cell-substrate adherence, is controlled by a tightly woven network of genes  <cit> . among this gene network, bcr <dig> is one of the best-characterized biofilm regulators  <cit> . through its adhesin targets als <dig>  als <dig>  hwp <dig> and ece <dig>  bcr <dig> mediates cell-substrate and cell-cell interactions in biofilms  <cit> . in this study, at the adhesion stage of biofilm formation , the expression of bcr <dig> went from less than to significantly higher than that of the control group. this may be due to the promoting effect of serum on hypha growth, as bcr <dig> rna accumulation depends on the hyphal developmental activator tec <dig> <cit> . als <dig> and als <dig> are members of the agglutinin-like sequence  gene family that encodes cell-wall glycoproteins  <cit> . most als proteins have adhesin functions  <cit> . mutational analysis indicates that strains lacking all functional als <dig> and als <dig> alleles  failed to produce any detectable adherent cells in biofilm models both in vivo and in vitro <cit> , or in actual biofilm formation. the als1Δ/als1Δ mutants produced substantial biofilms, but the biofilms often sloughed off the substrate, while the als3Δ/als3Δ mutant only produced scant, disorganized biofilms on catheter material in vitro <cit> . our data on transcript analysis showed that the expression of als <dig> and als <dig> were reduced at different time points in the biofilm adhesion stage. therefore, we supposed that the anti-adhesion effect of human serum might occur via inhibition of the expression of als <dig> and als <dig>  and therefore affect biofilm formation. previous studies have shown that a bcr1Δ/ bcr1Δ mutant, which has reduced expression of als <dig>  als <dig>  and other adhesins, has defective biofilm formation in both an in vitro and in vivo catheter model  <cit> . in this study, at 90 min of growth, the change in the levels of bcr <dig> level was different from als <dig> and als <dig>  indicating that als <dig> and als <dig> are also affected by other factors  <cit> .

interestingly, human serum promotes the expression of hwp <dig> and ece <dig>  hwp <dig> is a well-characterized hypha-specific gene that can mediate c. albicans cell-cell interactions and improve biofilm formation  <cit> . nobile et al. <cit>  found that the expression of hwp <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae permits adherence to wild-type c. albicans but not an als1Δ/als1Δ als3Δ/als3Δ double mutant. in addition, a tdh3-hwp <dig> hybrid gene could not promote biofilm formation in the als1Δ/als1Δ als3Δ/als3Δ background in vitro or in vivo. our study revealed that human serum decreased the expression level of als <dig> and als <dig>  so overexpression of hwp <dig> failed to save the adhesion and biofilm formation of c. albicans. ece <dig> was regarded as a hyphal-induced gene, although its mechanism of action is uncertain. our study showed that hyphae were significantly greater in the presence of serum than in the control group, especially in the mature biofilm stage . this may be due to the increase of ece <dig> and hwp <dig> <cit> .

in this study, we also tested the expression of adhesion-related genes in biofilms grown for 24 h and found that the expression trend of related genes at this time was similar to the adhesion phase, both in the reduction of als <dig> and als <dig> and the up-regulation of hwp <dig> and ece <dig>  the expression of the bcr <dig> gene, however, was significantly inhibited. its level was far lower than that of the control group. all in all, the serum reduces bcr <dig> gene expression, and that might be a reason for biofilm inhibition.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study demonstrated that human serum may reduce the biofilm formation of c. albicans by inhibiting adhesion. this inhibition is partly due to the down-regulation of adhesion-related genes, including als <dig>  als <dig> and bcr <dig>  meanwhile, the inhibitory effect of human serum is caused by non-protein components in the serum. therefore, biofilm formation in vivo may be “selected for”  rather than “induced” by serum at the level of transcription.
