BACKGROUND
motility is an important bacterial niche colonization factor  <cit> , thus many bacterial species are motile by flagellar rotation. in escherichia coli flagella propel bacteria swimming in liquid medium or in semisolid agar media  <cit> . in response to chemotactic external signals, e. coli is able to direct its swimming movement towards a microenvironment that is optimal for its growth and survival  <cit> . when the conditions for swimming become adverse e. coli develops a different program for swarming motility  <cit> . in many bacterial species this flagella-driven coordinated motility is mediated by cell-cell communication mechanisms such as quorum sensing  <cit> . thus, this bacterial migration activity is an intrinsically surface-linked phenomenon, leading to a change from an individual to a collective "social" behavior that allows the rapid exploration and colonization of surfaces  <cit> .

several environmental and nutritional factors promoting swarming behavior in some bacterial species such as proteus mirabilis  <cit> , serratia liquefaciens  <cit> , bacillus subtilis  <cit> , pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit>  and salmonella enterica serovar thyphimurium  <cit>  have been described. in e. coli, however, the chemical and physical factors involved in swarming migration are still to be characterized. by contrast, although the relationship between several types of environmental stress and bacterial motility has been well studied in swimming  <cit> , their effect on swarming motility has been poorly explored.

bacteria need to cope with different types of stress in nature  <cit> , environmentally induced dna damage  being a common one  <cit> . the relationship between dna damage and colonial motility has not been previously addressed. reca is a protein with a central role in dna stability and repair under stress conditions leading to dna damage  <cit> . reca has multiple functions affecting different cellular processes, such as genetic recombination  <cit> , the rescue of stalled or collapsed replication forks  <cit> , and the replication of damaged dna through translesion dna synthesis  by dna polymerase v   <cit> . moreover, it is a key component for lexa self-cleavage  <cit> . these processes require the interaction of reca with single-stranded -dna forming a helical nucleoprotein filament  <cit> .

in this paper, we describe a previously unsuspected role for reca in swarming, but not swimming motility in e. coli. the reca control of swarming motility represents a novel basic reca role under proliferating conditions beyond its pivotal activities in situations that lead to dna damage. our results indicate that this reca effect on collective swarming migration is possibly mediated through an operative reca mode requiring neither sos-induction nor extensive canonical reca-ssdna nucleoprotein filament formation.

RESULTS
reca is required for e. coli swarming but not swimming motility
e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig> strain growing on lb-glucose harnessed with  <dig> % difco agar exhibits a vigorous flagella-driven swarming migration, developing a robust colonial pattern associated to this type of motile collective behavior  <cit>  . while performing experiments designed to study the response of e. coli mg <dig> to dna-damage stress, we unexpectedly observed that e. coli mg <dig> deleted for the reca gene was impaired in its ability for swarming migration. this prompted us to study other reca-defective strains and we observed that all of them showed identical behaviour. the isogenic mg <dig> strains lacking the reca gene, jmg <dig> Δ306::tn <dig>  or jmg <dig> Δreca-518::kan , were severely impaired in their ability to migrate over semisolid agar surfaces, with a defective outward colonial expansion. figure 1b shows the swarming colonial pattern of the jmg <dig>  strain. to learn whether the absence of reca was responsible for the defective swarming migration, we carried out complementation experiments. the plasmid preca-htg, harboring an e. coli reca wild-type gene that encodes an n-terminal histidine-tagged reca protein , and the empty vector  were introduced by transformation into the wild-type and both Δreca  strains. similar results were obtained with mg <dig> Δreca <dig> or Δreca <dig> derivate strains, hence the results are only shown for one of them: the Δreca <dig> derivative. figure 2a shows that the swarming motility of the jmg <dig> Δreca <dig> strain harboring the plasmid preca-htg formed a colonial pattern similar to that of the wild-type mg <dig> strain. by contrast, the strain harboring the pca24n vector was severely impaired in swarming. the ability of the reca-htg variant to complement the swarming defect indicates that the lack of reca is the sole cause of the motility defect in the reca mutant strain. this result also demonstrated that the engineered reca variant  protein used in our experiments was capable of promoting the swarming motility process.

swimming motility is another well-known e. coli flagella-driven motility mode  <cit> . to test whether reca is also involved in the control of this individual motility process, we examined the swimming ability of the jmg <dig> Δreca <dig>  and jmg <dig> Δreca <dig>  strains. figure 3a shows that the Δreca mutant only had a slightly reduced swimming colony size. this small difference may be due to the additional time that the Δreca mutant takes at the start of swimming colony expansion, compared to the wild-type strain. however, the speed of the swimming advance was similar in both strains . this is consistent with normal flagellation, cellular size, and the individual movement of both swimming cell types . thus, it is likely that reca is unnecessary for swimming, although it is absolutely essential for swarming motility.

the reca effect on swarming motility is not restricted to the e. coli mg <dig> strain
the ability of e. coli strains to swarm on semisolid surfaces was initially described by harshey and matsuyama in  <dig>  <cit> , and has been studied intensively in the rp <dig> strain  <cit> . to know whether the effect of reca on swarming motility was specific to the strain mg <dig>  both the swarming and swimming motility behaviour of the rp <dig> and rp <dig> Δreca  <cit>  strains were assayed. the swarming capacity of the rp <dig> Δreca strain was severely impaired when compared to the wild-type rp <dig> strain. figure 2c shows that the negative effect produced by the reca deletion on the swarming motility of the rp <dig> strain was almost fully restored by the introduction of the preca-htg plasmid. as in the case of jmg <dig> Δreca <dig>  swimming motility was not affected by the Δreca mutation . these findings indicate that the effect of reca on swarming motility on "difco" semisolid surfaces is not restricted to mg <dig>  examination of the swarming colonial patterns of jmg <dig>   and rp <dig> Δreca   also revealed that, under our experimental conditions, swarming of strain rp <dig> was not as active as that of strain mg <dig>  in addition, we also observed that when rp <dig> and mg <dig> strains were inoculated together on swarming plates, the mg <dig> swarming migration overtook the rp <dig> swarming ability on semisolid difco agar surfaces, under the conditions employed in this study . on the basis of these observations, we decided to use the mg <dig> strain as a model for the study of the reca effect on swarming motility in e. coli.

finally, by a simple visual observation of the colony advance edge of both the wild-type and Δreca strains, we can rule out any effect of reca on the production of slime because the slime that normally surrounds the colony periphery was, apparently, similar in both cases .

the reca effect on swarming motility does not require sos induction
reca functions as a key component of the regulatory system controlling the induction of the sos response  <cit> . the e.coli lexa protein represses the transcription of over  <dig> "sos response genes", the sos regulon, including lexa itself  <cit> . the reca interaction with ss-dna unveils its coprotease activity  that facilitates self-cleavage of the lexa repressor, with a subsequent deregulation of the sos response genes  <cit>  in an exquisite proportionally-tuned response adjusted to the level of dna damage  <cit> .

to address whether one or more components of the sos system could be the direct effector promoting swarming motility, comparative transcriptome expressions between the reca+ and Δreca cells, sampled from the edge of colonies grown on swarming plates, were performed by dna microarray analysis. the obtained results  indicated that the transcriptional profile of genes belonging to the sos regulon  <cit>  were identical in both cases. in addition, an mg <dig> derivative, harboring the chromosomal lexa <dig>  allele, encoding a well characterized lexa protein resistant to the reca stimulated lexa self-proteolysis, thus preventing the induction of the sos response  <cit> , was found to be fully proficient in swarming motility . thus, it is likely that the ability of e. coli to perform swarming migration on semi-solid surfaces does not require the induction of the sos response.

the Δreca strain grown on swarming agar does synthesize flagella yet shows a non-motile colony leading edge without any swarming motion
optical microscopy was used to determine whether Δreca cells showed defective individual and/or collective movements. wild-type cells extracted from the swarming colony edge showed a vigorous and rapid individual movement when suspended in an lb liquid drop. however, Δreca cells showed a very slow movement. direct observation of the leading edge of the swarming colonies indicated that the wild-type colony edge exhibited a vigorous and very rapid convective and collective cell movement, with swirling patterns  <cit> . in contrast, the leading edge of the Δreca swarming colonies presented a completely resting edge colony . this deficient collective movement of the Δreca strain, leading to a defective colony pattern development, could possibly be due to the absence or damage of the flagella. to test this hypothesis, flagella were stained in both the wild-type and Δreca cells. a total of  <dig> cells from each strain  were visualized . figure 4a shows a typical wild-type swarming cell with five or six peritrichous flagella. a total of  <dig>  mg <dig> reca+ cells and  <dig>  mg <dig> Δreca  cells were similar to the one shown in the figure. the Δreca preparations contained abundant flagella, yet appeared disconnected from the cell , thereby indicating that Δreca cells have the ability to synthesize flagella. more than 99%  of the mg <dig> Δreca  cells were similar to those shown in the figure.

this result is additionally supported by a comparative dna microarray analysis between the reca+ and Δreca cells grown on semisolid surfaces. this analysis showed that both chemotaxis and flagellar genes related with e. coli motility  <cit>  had similar expression levels in both genetic backgrounds . thus, it is likely that the impaired production of flagella is not responsible for the lack of swarming motility of Δreca cells. all together these results suggest that the non-motile behavior of the individual Δreca cells may be due to the impaired flagellar propulsion function necessary to drive the swarming migration process.

reca-gfp complementation assays under different proliferating conditions: segregation of reca functions
reca is a multifunctional protein that is involved in dna recombination, dna double-strand break repair, induction of the sos response, sos mutagenesis and the repair of stalled replication forks  <cit> . these are, in all cases, functions that depend on reca-ssdna nucleofilament formation  <cit> . to gain further insight into the involvement of reca in swarming motility, we took advantage of the construction of a reca-green fluorescent protein fusion   <cit> . our reasoning was that this fusion protein could lose its ability to generate the reca filament formation because of the bulky gfp portion. the ability of the reca-gfp chimera to complement the defects of the Δreca strain in growth, viability, sos induction, uv sensibility, genetic recombination and swarming motility was compared to that of the reca-htg variant. no significant differences between mg <dig> reca+ harboring preca-htg, preca-gfp or pca24n  in growth, uv survival, viability and genetic recombination were observed. thus, for simplicity, the complementation behavior of plasmids pca24n, preca-htg and preca-gfp in the Δreca background refers to the strain mg <dig> reca+  as a wild-type control. table  <dig> and figures 2a, 2b,  <dig> and  <dig> show the results of these rescue experiments with both protein variants and several important results can be extracted from them.

swarming motility
genetic recombination
reca is essential for genetic recombination  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  reca-htg completely restored the production of recombinant Δreca transconjugants to a level similar to the wild-type strain. by contrast, the reca-gfp protein was remarkably inefficient in carrying out this activity. these results strongly suggest that the reca-htg variant was proficient for both dna pairing and strand exchange between homologous dna molecules, whereas the reca-gfp variant was not.

growth and swarm cell viability
it has previously been described that an mg <dig> derivative Δreca strain shows defective growth  <cit> . to rule out the possibility that the defective swarming motility of the reca mutant was associated to defective growth or decreased viability, both the growth rate and viability of the wild-type and Δreca strains were measured . the growth rate of the Δreca  strain in lb broth supplemented with  <dig> % d--glucose was reduced when compared to the wild-type  strain. the Δreca  strain also showed slow growth. the slow growth of the Δreca strain could only be partially restored by the reca-htg variant protein. indeed, even though the reca-gfp protein appears to exacerbate the slow growth of the Δreca strain, it is still proficient in rescuing its swarming motility defect. these results therefore strongly suggest that the slow growth rate of the Δreca strain is not the cause of the defective swarming motility.

alternatively, the impaired swarming motility of the Δreca cells may be the result of cell viability loss  <cit> . this possibility was tested by assessing membrane integrity by staining both the wild-type and Δreca mutant cells isolated from the leading edge of swarming plates with the live/dead baclight kit . a total of  <dig> cells were visualized in each case. a similar number of cells  appeared viable. this result suggested that the loss of viability was not involved in defective swarming migration.

uv survival
reca is required for the recovery of uv-treated cells  <cit> . as shown in figure 6a lane  <dig>  the reca-htg variant was proficient in rescuing the uv-sensitivity phenotype of the Δreca strain, however reca-gfp was not , suggesting that reca-gfp is impaired in recovering from the uv-induced dna lesions, i.e. rescue of the replication fork  <cit>  and the recombinational dna repair  <cit>  both of which required dna strand exchange.

sos induction
treatment of cells with some agents, such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics, induces sos response  <cit> . here we employed the transcriptional dinb::lacz gene fusion as a reporter of sos induction  <cit> . as shown in figure 6b, the reca-htg protein supported the norfloxacin-mediated sos induction, detected as a strong blue/green band around the norfloxacin inhibition halo in a lawn of the Δreca  strain. however, the reca-gfp protein was unable to complement the defect in sos induction. by contrast, the reca-gfp protein was fully inactive in rescuing the Δreca antibiotic sensitivity phenotype, as the size of the norfloxacin inhibition halo for the gw <dig> Δreca  strain  was as large as that corresponding to gw <dig> Δreca  .

thus, by using the reca-gfp fusion protein we have been able to segregate the reca function on swarming promotion from the other reca functions. the combination of all our results strongly supports the notion that, although the reca-gfp protein is proficient in promoting swarming motility, it has lost its capacity to promote sos induction, recombinational dna repair and genetic recombination.

biochemical studies on ssdna-dependent atpase activity of the reca-gfp protein fusion
the above results obtained with the reca-gfp protein fusion suggest the possibility that reca promotes swarming motility via a molecular mode, independently of the reca filament formation and/or dna strand exchange. the reca-htg and reca-gfp proteins were purified and biochemically characterized. atp binding induces reca assembly on ssdna and adp induces reca disassembly from dna  <cit> . therefore, atp hydrolysis is an indirect measure of reca protein binding to ssdna, and under most condition the rate of atp hydrolysis correlates to the amount of reca bound to ssdna. the reca, reca-htg or reca-gfp catalyzed ssdna-dependent atp hydrolysis was assayed using half-saturating protein concentrations  in buffer c containing  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> mm atp . the rate of reca and reca-htg-mediated atp hydrolysis increased during the first  <dig> min after binding to ssdna, reaching levels similar to those observed in the wild-type reca protein  <cit>  . in the absence of ssdna, atp hydrolysis by wild-type reca, reca-htg or reca-gfp was just above the background .

the atpase activity of the reca-gfp variant was  <dig> to 10-fold lower when compared to the reca-htg variant  or wild-type reca protein  <cit>  . the presence of increasing concentrations of reca-gfp slightly enhanced atpase activity . a modification of the ph in the reaction mixture exerted either a negative effect  at ph  <dig>  or a positive effect  at ph  <dig>  where reca binds double stranded  dna  <cit>  . the atpase activity of reca-htg or reca-gfp variants was strongly inhibited by prebound ssb to ssdna . therefore, it is improbable that we are measuring the activity of a possibly contaminating ssdna-dependent atpase.

if long nucleoprotein filaments are to be formed, the inherent rate of extension of the reca filaments during assembly should be faster than the end-dependent disassembly. we have shown that reca-gfp catalyzes atp hydrolysis less efficiently than reca-htg or wild-type reca protein and assumed that reca-gfp might promote end-dependent disassembly at a very low rate and perhaps, under these conditions, long nucleoprotein filaments could be formed. to address this hypothesis, the wild-type reca or the variants reca-htg or reca-gfp  were incubated with circular ssdna in the presence of  <dig> mm atpγs and the reaction visualized by electron microscopy. as observed for reca   <cit> , the reca-htg-ssdna complex shows an extended helical conformation in the presence of atpγs . under standard conditions, using  <dig> μm reca-htg, 8– <dig> nucleoprotein filaments per field were observed . however, under identical conditions, we have failed to detect long reca-gfp nucleoprotein filaments on circular ssdna in the presence of atpγs after analysing more than  <dig> different fields . only reca-gfp blobs were observed even in the presence of  <dig> μm reca-gfp . therefore, we can conclude that quite probably the gfp moiety inhibited the reca nucleation step in reca-gfp filament formation.

under typical assay conditions, atp acts in combination with reca or its reca-htg variant to promote pairing and strand exchanges  <cit> . reca-gfp, however, failed to promote strand exchange when using a circular ssdna and a kpni-linearized homologous dsdna.

overall these biochemical data are consistent with the results obtained from in vivo genetic recombination experiments . in combination, the results of genetic complementation and biochemical assays presented in the previous sections strongly support the notion that the reca-gfp protein, although proficient in promoting swarming motility, does not have the capacity to promote both sos induction and homologous recombination, activities requiring an extensive canonical reca-ssdna filament formation. however, the possibility that a residual localized reca-gfp short filament unable to reach a sufficient level to induce the sos could be responsible for this activity in swarming cells cannot be ruled out. a short reca-gfp filament formation could explain the residual in vivo genetic recombination observed in the Δreca  strain .

discussion
in this paper, we present experimental evidence supporting the fact that the reca protein, described as the prototypic member of the evolutionarily-conserved reca/rad <dig> family of proteins  <cit> , is required for e. coli k- <dig> swarming but not swimming motility. the reca protein plays a key role in recombinational dna repair and genetic recombination processes via its biochemical activity of pairing and exchanging dna between two homologous chromosomes  <cit> . by forming an active filament on ssdna, reca controls the induction of the sos response, promotes the generation of the sos-induced dna polymerase v  active complex   <cit> , and furthermore the reca filament has the ability to interact with polv in trans to stimulate its activity on translesion dna synthesis , a sos mutagenesis pathway, in response to chronic dna damage  <cit> . the results presented here expand on our knowledge of the physiological processes affected by this important protein and reveal a hitherto unknown role for reca in the e. coli physiology: the promotion of swarming motility. although it has been described that salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium mutant strains with lps defects are differentially affected in their abilities to swarm and swim  <cit> , reca is the first reported cellular factor that specifically affects swarming but not swarming motility in e. coli.

at least two models could explain the reca requirement for swarming motility. in the first one, reca interacts with one or several cellular component expressed  during the swarming differentiation process, but not during swimming motility. this model implies that reca could influence the expression of a certain gene in swarming cells, however, the results of our transcriptome analysis indicated that the expression of a hypothetical component in swarming cells seems to be a reca-independent process, because reca does not influence gene expression in swarming cells. this is consistent with the observation that reca-gfp fails to induce the sos response, although it does promote swarming motility. in the second model, reca may undergo a "modification"  to reach an activated form that allows swarming motility.

regardless of the molecular mechanism behind reca-dependent swarming motility, reca must interact with an unknown cellular target to promote this motility. recent global protein interaction network experiments in e. coli revealed a direct physical interaction between the reca and the chew protein  <cit> . the chew protein is a cytoplasmic linker of the chemotactic signal transduction system that couples the membrane chemoreceptors to the intracellular cytoplasmic phosphorylation cascade  <cit> . this cascade controls the direction of flagellar motor rotation  <cit> , which is an essential component in the mechanical control of the chemotaxis system on swarming motility in salmonella enterica serovar typhimutium  <cit> . thus, it is tempting to speculate that a reca-chew physical interaction, active in swarming but not in swimming cells, could be the direct link between reca and swarming motility.

all functions so far described for the reca protein are related to their fundamental biological role in the maintenance of genome integrity and variability. these functions require the formation of an extensive reca-ssdna nucleofilament complex as a central molecular scaffold that drives the reca activities in homologous recombination, sos induction and sos mutagenesis. the reca-ssdna nucleofilament formation is a very orchestrated, dynamic and precise molecular process during dna strand exchange  <cit> . in addition, the cells have several molecular modulators, such as the ssb, single-stranded dna-binding protein, recfor proteins, dini, recx and rdgc influencing reca's filament extension  <cit> . it is widely accepted that under most conditions the rate of atp hydrolysis by the reca protein correlates with the amounts of reca bound to ssdna  <cit> . although the reca-gfp protein used in our studies retained a residual ssdna-dependent atpase activity, it completely lost its dna strand exchange ability, a process requiring an extensive reca-ssdna nucleofilament formation. despite this impaired in vitro biochemical activity, reca-gfp is proficient in complementing the defective swarming motility of a Δreca mutant. we consider that the segregation of the reca effect on swarming motility from those that require the formation of long canonical reca-ssdna  nucleoprotein filaments, favor the hypothesis that the formation of these long filaments is not strictly necessary for swarming motility. alternative models, including a reca activity independent of any dna interaction cannot, however, be discarded.

the integration of two, apparently disconnected, biological processes, such as the maintenance of genome integrity and motility in a unique protein, may have important evolutive consequences. adaptive biological evolution, relying upon the existence of genetic variability in a population of organisms generated by mutation and recombination and upon the natural selection of genotypes with better fitness, also depends on the capacity of the fittest to colonize the niche. the existence of a molecule able to receive signals informing on the status of genome stability and transmitting them to cellular systems, which in turn permit rapid spatial migration, could be an important factor for improving the colonization of a new ecological niche. thus, it is tempting to speculate that the reca protein could be the molecule that links those apparently independent molecular processes, permitting bacteria to manage the different cellular processes in a coordinated manner, influencing their adaptive capacity.

an important goal in future research will be to determine the ultimate molecular entity and the operative molecular mechanism through which reca allows swarming motility in e. coli to proceed. the possibility of this novel function being conserved in other reca homologues should also be explored.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel physiological role for e. coli reca, a protein previously known as a key multifunctional cellular factor required for the maintenance of genome integrity under stress, has been described in this work. reca participates actively in the promotion of e. coli swarming motility but not swimming motility. while the ultimate operative molecular mode through which reca acts to control e. coli swarming motility is waiting to be disclosed, the reca effect on swarming motility appears to be independent of an extensive canonical reca nucleofilament formation. the integration of two apparently disconnected biologically important processes, such as the maintenance of genome integrity and motility in a unique protein, may have important evolutive consequences.
