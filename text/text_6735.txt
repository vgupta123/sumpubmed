BACKGROUND
cells are continuously subjected to dna lesions arising both from environmental conditions and from the intrinsic metabolism of a cell. such lesions can lead to mutations and large-scale genome alterations that may be deleterious for cellular function. to maintain genomic stability cell cycle checkpoints exist that can detect errors during dna replication. if errors are encountered, cell division is paused and repair mechanisms and/or cell death ensues. the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein plays an important role in this process  <cit> . by being part of a signal transduction process, p <dig> relays information leading to cellular responses such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, resulting from dna lesions. p <dig> activity is regulated mainly at the protein level. in response to dna lesions, p <dig> is rescued from targeted degradation, which leads to a strong increase in the amount of the otherwise short-lived tumor suppressor protein, and the protein is intensively modified  <cit> . cells deficient in p <dig> fail to undergo apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in response to dna damage  <cit>  which increases the rates of tumorigenicity and genomic instability in these animals  <cit> .

pluripotent, undifferentiated embryonic stem  cells retain the potential to produce any cell type in the body and contribute to all adult cell lineages. while mutations in a somatic cell are limited to a particular lineage and do not affect progeny, es cell mutations potentially compromise multiple lineages and affect the well-being of subsequent generations. as such, es cells should have a highly sensitive and finely tuned response to dna damage. in fact, previous reports described a reduction of mutation frequency by about two orders of magnitude in es cells and a strongly enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation  and other dna damaging agents  <cit> . because of the prominent role that p <dig> has in the dna damage response of differentiated cells, it is most likely that p <dig> has a similar function in stem cells. indeed, it has been reported that p <dig> deficiency increases the teratogenicity of mice after administration of benzopyrene or after irradiation  <cit> .

despite previous research, it is still unclear whether p <dig> is activated or not in stem cells in response to dna damage. while yang xu and co-workers found that p <dig> levels are increased in response to dna damage in es cells and mdm <dig> and noxa are expressed after irradiation of es cells with uv-light or treatment with doxorubicin, mirit aladjem observed that p <dig> failed to activate a stress response in es cells after treatment with pala, ir or adriamycin despite the accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein in the nucleus of dna-damaged es cells,  <cit> .

to clarify about the role of p <dig> in es cells, we investigated p <dig> localization and activity in resting es cells and in es cells subjected to dna damage in more detail. similar to mirit aladjem and co-workers  <cit> , we found the majority of p <dig> localized in the cytoplasm of proliferating es cells. however, after irradiation, p <dig> accumulated in the nucleus. nuclear accumulation of p <dig> in irradiated stem cells correlated with the activation of mdm <dig>  p <dig>  noxa and puma and the suppression of nanog.

RESULTS
p <dig> is localized to the cytoplasm of mouse es cells
in an attempt to resolve the caveat whether p <dig> is active or not in stem cells, we first determined the localization of the p <dig> protein in mouse es cells. we investigated three different mouse es cell lines, r <dig>  d <dig> and cgr <dig> and determined p <dig> localization by immuno-fluorescence staining. r <dig> and d <dig> cells were cultured on feeder cells while cgr <dig> stem cells do not require feeders for maintaining an undifferentiated phenotype. in consistency with a previous report  <cit> , we found the majority of p <dig> localized in the cytoplasm . these results however do not exclude the possibility that a small fraction of p <dig> exists in the nucleus.

since some p <dig> isoforms have been shown to be cytoplasmic  <cit> , we wondered whether p <dig> might show cytoplasmic localization in murine es cells because of the expression of particular cytoplasmic isoform of p <dig>  however, both rt-pcr and western blotting with a polyclonal anti-murine p <dig> antiserum, detected a single strong band for p <dig>  this band migrated app. with the  <dig> kda marker in sds gels and with the  <dig> bp marker in agarose gels . only upon longer exposures, smaller bands became visible. whether these smaller bands represent authentic splice products of p <dig> or whether they only show cross-reactivity with other factors remains to be elucidated.

as a transcription factor, p <dig> usually needs to be nuclear to be active. because of its cytoplasmic expression, we wondered whether p <dig> would be able to activate transcription of its target genes in es cells. to test this possibility we transfected r <dig> es cells with a cdna encoding the lacz gene under the control of the p53-responsive rgc promoter  <cit>  and determined expression of β-galactosidase. for monitoring transfection efficiency, we co-transfected a cdna encoding the green fluorescent protein . only a few cells showed β-galactosidase expression . likewise, only a few cells showed expression of gfp which indicates that a minority of stem cells had been transfected. since staining for gfp and x-gal corresponded in numbers, it is most likely that all transfected es cells express β-galactosidase under the control of p <dig> 

p <dig> becomes activated in es cells after dna damage
one particularly important function of p <dig> is dna damage signaling  <cit> . here, to suppress tumorigenesis, p <dig> halts the cell cycle and induces apoptosis in primary cells and in tumor cell lines. since stem cells provide the pool of proliferative pluri/toti/omni-potent cells within organisms, they are more likely to propagate dna lesions and mutations to daughter cells compared to differentiated cells. we therefore speculated that p <dig> has an important role in the dna damage response of stem cells. since p <dig> is primarily a transcription factor, nuclear localization of p <dig> should be essential for its transcriptional activity. this activity is, however, not consistent with the cytoplasmic localization of the tumor suppressor protein in es cells. one possibility could be that despite its cytoplasmic localization in non-stressed es cells, p <dig> accumulates in the nucleus of es cells after dna damage. we tested this possibility after irradiation with both ir and uv light. as we show already in figure  <dig>  in unstressed es cells p <dig> was localized mainly to the cytoplasm. however, at one hour after irradiation, p <dig> accumulated in the nucleus of irradiated es cells . at four hours after irradiation, p <dig> was still present in the nucleus of some cells, while in others it had mostly disappeared. at eight hours after irradiation p <dig> had essentially disappeared from the nucleus of all cells. surprisingly, at  <dig> hours after ir, p <dig> was again localized in the nucleus of most cells. nevertheless, a minority of cells still showed cytoplasmic localization of p <dig> . the same biphasic accumulation of p <dig> in the nucleus of irradiated cells was also observed in the cgr <dig> stem cell line .

after uv-irradiation, p <dig> also accumulated in the nucleus of es cells. in contrast to ir-irradiated cells, p <dig> remained in the nucleus of uv-irradiated cells. at  <dig> hours, most of the es cells had died while the few remaining ones showed a very intensive nuclear staining for p <dig> .

after having observed that p <dig> accumulates in the nucleus of irradiated es cells, we used qrt-pcr and western blotting to test whether p <dig> activated transcription of its target genes. to prevent contamination by feeder cells, es cells were sub-cultured once  or twice  without feeder cells. since es cells were sub-cultured every day, p <dig> cells had been cultured without feeders for only two days. to exclude the possibility of premature differentiation in the absence of feeder cells, we monitored expression of nanog and oct  <dig> at the rna and protein level  and of alkaline phosphatase . although p <dig> cells were hardly contaminated with feeder cells, we additionally determined expression of p <dig> target genes in feeder cells. we further included 3t <dig> mouse fibroblasts in the analysis in order to compare the regulation of p <dig> target genes in es cells with that of differentiated cells. to exclude artifacts due to culture conditions, we also included es  cells that had not been irradiated but were plated and harvested at the same time as irradiated cells. as we show in figure 3a, the accumulation of p <dig> in the nucleus of irradiated es cells  was accompanied by a strong increase in the amount of p <dig> protein. shortly after the accumulation of p <dig> protein levels, mdm <dig> and puma proteins levels also increased. consistent with a previous report  <cit> , the amount of p <dig> protein was very low in stem cells and was not increased after irradiation. likewise, we failed to detect an increase in the amount of bax protein. we also observed an increase in the amount of noxa protein, but only at  <dig> hours and induction was very low. consistent with the study by lin and co-workers  <cit> , we found that nanog protein was slightly reduced after dna damage, but recovered to basal levels eight hours after irradiation . in non-irradiated r <dig> cells, the levels of the investigated proteins remained unchanged throughout the experiment . in comparison to es cells, 3t <dig> cells showed slightly different kinetics of p <dig> induction after ir. here, we observed the strongest induction at one hour after irradiation. consistent with a more important role of p <dig> for the maintenance of genomic integrity in stem cells than in differentiated cells, the overall induction of p <dig> was much higher in es cells than in 3t <dig> cells. like in es cells, the increase in the amount of p <dig> in 3t <dig> cells was followed by an increase in the amount of the mdm <dig> and the p <dig> protein. the amount of the p <dig> protein was also very high in feeder cells which have been irradiated prior to the plating of the cells, suggesting that p <dig> levels may remain high for several days after irradiation. as expected, we failed to detect nanog and oct- <dig> proteins in 3t <dig> cells . the determination of the amount of proteins was complemented by qrt-pcr. to allow a direct comparison of the expression of p <dig> target genes at the rna and protein level, we performed qrt-pcr on a second aliquot of the same lot of cells that had been used for western blot analysis. the analysis of the pcr products by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed single bands in all cases . it should, though, be noted that the analysis of the pcr products by agarose gel electrophoresis was not quantitative. the analysis of gene expression by qrt-pcr essentially mirrored results from western blotting, with two exceptions: while the p <dig> protein was hardly detectable in stem cells and its amount was not increased after ir, we observed p <dig> rna in stem cells at a level that was almost comparable with the amount of p <dig> rna in 3t <dig> cells. moreover, the amount of p <dig> rna was further increased in response to ir in es cells. another difference between protein and rna analysis was observed for puma. while western blotting displayed a similar increase in the amount of puma in 3t <dig> and es cells, puma rna was induced about 2-fold stronger in 3t <dig> cells than in es cells. like the protein, mdm <dig> rna accumulated transiently in both es and 3t <dig> cells. however, maximum mdm <dig> induction in 3t <dig> cells occurred earlier , consistent with the earlier increase in p <dig> protein abundance . consistent with the second phase of nuclear accumulation of p <dig>  we observed induction of the p <dig> target gene noxa at twenty-four hours after irradiation in es cells while we failed to detect expression of noxa in 3t <dig> cells, despite its expression in feeder cells. we also failed to detect an increase in the expression of bax rna both in es cells and in 3t <dig> cells. both stem cell markers, oct  <dig> and nanog were highly expressed in es cells but clearly reduced  or absent  in differentiated cells. after irradiation, the amount of nanog rna was slightly reduced in es cells but not in 3t <dig> cells .

influence of p <dig> on proliferation and survival of es cells after ionising radiation
after showing that p <dig> accumulates in the nucleus and activates transcription of its target genes, we wondered whether the presence of p <dig> might be required for a normal dna damage response in es cells. to address this question, we first compared the colony forming ability of r <dig> es cells with that of r <dig> es cells where p <dig> activity was inhibited by treatment with α- or μ-pifithrin  <cit> . as we show in figure 4a, irradiation reduced the colony forming ability of r <dig> es cells in a dose dependent manner. treatment with pifithrin further sensitized the es cells to ir, suggesting a protective effect of p <dig>  to further investigate this protective effect, we repeated the colony forming assay with p53-negative es cells  and the corresponding parental cell line . both cell lines showed a dose dependent decrease in their colony forming ability after ir. the sensitivity of d <dig> cells and the p53-negative derivatives to irradiation, though, appeared to be significantly stronger than that of r <dig> cells and the size of the individual colonies varied significantly after irradiation in both d <dig> cells and the p53-negative derivative. a protective effect of p <dig> was, however, not discernable .

in apoptotic cells, the membrane-phospholipid phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, thereby exposing phosphatidylserine to the external cellular environment. the phospholipid-binding protein annexin-v, which has a high affinity for the phospholipid binds to those cells that expose phosphatidylserine. this association of annexin-v with exposed phosphatidylserine is a sensitive and widely accepted method for the determination of apoptosis. we applied this method to determine the influence of p <dig> on the initiation of apoptosis of irradiated es cells. to prevent contamination, we performed this assay with es cells that have been passaged once without feeder cells . under these conditions, we observed no signs of apoptosis with p53-positive d <dig> cells while p53-negative cells showed a slight increase in the number of apoptotic cells at  <dig> hours after irradiation . nevertheless, the increase was still within the error bars of non-irradiated cells and unexpectedly low. we also performed this analysis with cells that had been passaged twice without feeders . under these conditions about twice as many es cells were annexin-v-positive, even without irradiation . this number of annexin-v-positive es cells was slightly increased after irradiation. nevertheless, the increase in annexin-v positive cells after irradiation never exceeded a factor of  <dig>  .

a widely used assay for the determination of relative cell proliferation and cell viability is the colorimetric mtt-assay, which determines the reduction of yellow - <dig> -diphenyltetrazolium bromide to purple formazan by metabolic enzymes. we employed this assay to determine relative cell proliferation and cell viability of irradiated p53-positive and the corresponding p53-negative es cells. surprisingly, p53-negative es cells derived from the d <dig> es cell line proliferated slower and reached a plateau at a lower cell density in comparison with their parental counterpart. irradiation had only a minor impact on the proliferation of these p53-negative es cells and affected cell number only within the first  <dig> hours after irradiation. thereafter, irradiated and non-irradiated p53-negative es cells had a similar proliferation rate. proliferation of the corresponding p53-positive es cell line was affected much more by radiation. cell proliferation of the d <dig> es cell line was more strongly reduced after irradiation and the proliferation rate was decreased over several days .

discussion
consistent with a previous report  <cit> , we found p <dig> localized in the cytoplasm of es cells. however, while mirit aladjam and co-workers reported that p <dig> is inactive in stem cells  <cit> , we found that p <dig> activates transcription of a reporter gene in resting es cells and of endogenous target genes in response to dna damage. the activity of p <dig> in resting stem cells shows that the p <dig> protein is also in es cells in a latent state and can be activated when its activity is required. this result is consistent with a study from sabapathy et al., who observed binding of p <dig> from es cells to oligonucleotides corresponding to the p <dig> consensus binding sequence  <cit> . after dna damage, p <dig> did not activate all, but at least some of its target genes in es cells. transcription of these genes was facilitated by the presence of active p <dig> in the nucleus of irradiated cells. after ir, p <dig> accumulated in two waves in the nucleus of es cells. the first nuclear accumulation occurred at one to two hours after irradiation and correlated with an increase in the amount of the p <dig> protein. during the second wave of nuclear accumulation of p <dig> at twenty-four hours after irradiation, we did not see an increase in p <dig> abundance suggesting that for the second wave of nuclear accumulation p <dig> was translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. whether nuclear translocation also contributed to the first wave of nuclear accumulation of p <dig> is still unclear. both waves of nuclear accumulation of p <dig> corresponded to transcriptional activation of target genes. the first wave of nuclear accumulation of p <dig> correlated with transcriptional activation of mdm <dig>  p <dig> and puma  <cit> , while noxa  <cit>  was transcribed during the second wave of nuclear accumulation of p <dig>  why some of the p <dig> target genes are transcribed only during the first wave of nuclear accumulation and why at least one other gene is transcribed only during the second wave of nuclear accumulation is presently unclear. it may be that distinct post-translational modifications of p <dig> are induced with different kinetics after irradiation and are required for the activation of different p <dig> target genes  <cit> .

most surprisingly, p <dig> was actively transcribed in es cells and the amount of its rna was increased further in response to ir, while the protein was hardly detectable before and after irradiation. this result indicates that production of p <dig> protein is strongly regulated at a post-transcriptional level in es cells. eventually, es cells with damaged dna require efficient elimination from the population. since g <dig> arrest triggered by p <dig> can prevent cells from s-phase entry and thus from the cellular death program that is executed in the s-phase of cells with damaged dna, e.g. by the activity of proteins such as killin, the presence of p <dig> might counteract this elimination  <cit> . however, consistent with the results of corbet et al., we did not see a strong induction of apoptosis in es cells after ionizing radiation, as revealed by annexin-v staining  <cit>  which argues against this possibility.

while we observed activation of the transcription of mdm <dig>  puma, noxa and p <dig>  we failed to detect an activation of bax transcription  <cit>  after ir. probably, activation of bax after dna damage is restricted to specific cell types that were not included in this study. such a selectivity of gene expression in different cell lines is known for several years. for instance, it had been shown that γ-irradiation leads to a prolonged cell cycle arrest in fibroblasts whereas the same challenge leads to apoptosis in thymocytes and intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> .

overall, the impact of p <dig> on the response of murine es cells to ionizing radiation was surprisingly low. the comparison of p53-positive and p53-negative stem cells of the same background showed basically identical colony forming abilities after dna damage. only when we treated the r <dig> es cell line with chemical inhibitors of p <dig>  we observed a slightly decreased survival in the presence of the drug. since this result could not be reproduced with p53-positive and p53-negative es cell lines, the increased sensitivity of r <dig> es cells in the presence of μ- or α-pifithrin is most likely due to off-target effects. it should though be noted that corbet et al., although they also found only very little induction of apoptosis after irradiation of es cells with ir, reported a more pronounced reduction in the colony forming ability of p53-positive es cells after ir than of p53-negative cells  <cit> . the reason for the discrepancy of our result and the result from corbet is unclear. however, since the es cell lines that were used by corbet et al., and the ones that we used are not identical, it is likely that the different results are due to a variation in intrinsic cellular paramaters. only when we applied the mtt assay, we observed a slight difference between p53-positive and p53-negative es cells after irradiation. however, this result should be taken with care. first of all, the mtt-assay is a metabolic assay and conditions that affect cell metabolism can impact on the result. secondly, p53-negative cells showed a significantly reduced proliferation  behavior compared to the p53-positive parental cell line. this different proliferation behavior could also affect the outcome of the assay.

while p <dig> is predominantly a nuclear protein in differentiated cells, in es cells p <dig> is mostly cytoplasmic. the rational for this aberrant localization of p <dig> in es cells is still unclear. however, since p <dig> suppresses nanog expression as well as self-renewal of adult neural stem cells  <cit>  it is possible that p <dig> needs to be separated from the nucleus of es cells to maintain an undifferentiated phenotype. by sequestering p <dig> to the cytoplasm, p <dig> is unable to suppress nanog while, at the same time, sufficient latent p <dig> protein is present in es cells to enter the nucleo-cytoplasmic barrier when required.

CONCLUSIONS
our study clearly shows that p <dig> can be activated in stem cells despite its cytoplasmic localisation. however, results for p <dig> activation in stem cells depend on the selection of genes that are analyzed and whether the analysis is performed at the rna or protein level.

whether p <dig> activity is required for the dna damage response of es cells cannot be answered that easily. overall, we found only a minor effect of p <dig> activity on proliferation and survival of es cells after ionizing irradiation. the analysis, however, also shows that in dependence on what method is used, the result can vary.
