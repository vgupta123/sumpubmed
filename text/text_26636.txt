BACKGROUND
anopheles cruzii  is the primary vector of human and simian malaria parasites in southern and southeastern brazil  <cit> . earlier studies that evaluated x chromosome inversion frequencies  <cit>  and isoenzyme profiles  <cit>  suggest that anopheles cruzii is a species complex. a recent analysis of genetic differentiation using the timeless gene among an. cruzii populations from southern, southeastern and northeastern brazil indicated that the population from itaparica, bahia state  is a different species  <cit> .

in the current study, a multilocus analysis using six different nuclear gene fragments was performed comparing two populations of an. cruzii , representing respectively the southeastern and northeastern sibling species. three of the fragments used are orthologues of drosophila melanogaster genes involved in the control of circadian rhythms: timeless , clock  and cycle ; and three code for ribosomal proteins: rp <dig> , rps <dig>  and rps <dig> .

the aim of the study was to determine if there is still gene flow between the two sibling species and to estimate their divergence time. furthermore, circadian genes  <cit>  putatively involved in the control of mating rhythms  <cit> , such as timeless, clock and cycle, are potentially important in maintaining temporal reproductive isolation between closely related species. based on that, this study also aimed to verify whether the differentiation in circadian genes is higher than the divergence in constitutive loci, such as the ribosomal protein genes rp <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig> 

RESULTS
polymorphism and divergence between florianópolis and itaparica
one of the assumptions of the isolation with migration model used in this study is the absence of recombination within the studied loci. in order to fulfill this requirement, the optimal recombination-filtered block was extracted from each gene alignment . table  <dig> shows the position of the non-recombining  blocks used in this study as well as the putative recombinant sequences that were removed . another assumption of the im program is that the variation observed in the studied loci is neutral. therefore, the tajima  <cit>  and fu & li  <cit>  tests of neutrality were used and the results are presented in table  <dig>  no significant deviations from neutrality were observed after bonferroni correction.

estimation of demographic population parameters
the im program was used to simultaneously estimate six demographic parameters  from the two an. cruzii sibling species through an "isolation with migration" model using multiple loci  <cit> . as mentioned above, only the nr blocks were used and some recombining sequences were removed before the im analysis .

the estimates of θ suggest that the effective population size of the ancestral population is smaller than the current florianópolis and itaparica populations indicating that both may have had a history of growth since separation . the migration rates in both directions for all combined loci were also estimated by the im software . no indication of migration was found in either direction in the multiple simulations.

the divergence time parameter was estimated for all combined loci in four different im runs. this parameter cannot be directly converted to years because the mutation rates in anopheles cruzii species are unknown. therefore, an estimate of the divergence time between anopheles cruzii species was performed using the average of drosophila synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates for several nuclear genes   <cit> . using this approach and based on the average of hismth values, an estimate of the divergence time between florianópolis and itaparica would be approximately  <dig>  mya .

another manner of estimating the divergence time between these two anopheles species is to use the same drosophila synonymous substitution rate mentioned above and the average da values from the six loci . based on these values, the divergence time between the populations from florianópolis and itaparica was estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya for the whole sequence and nr blocks, respectively.

genealogy analysis
gene trees of the sequences from all loci for both whole sequences and nr blocks were estimated using the neighbor-joining method  . the most suitable model selected using modeltest  <dig>   <cit>  was kimura 2-parameter  <cit>  for all loci except for the clock gene where the jukes and cantor  <cit>  model was chosen. all trees were performed with  <dig>  bootstrap replicates. the resulting nj trees clearly grouped the sequences from the two sibling species in different clusters with high bootstrap values in most cases.

discussion
the results presented here confirm the high level of differentiation between the itaparica and florianópolis sibling species of the an. cruzii complex  <cit> .

less differentiation might have been expected in the three genes that code for the highly conserved ribosomal proteins  than in loci possibly involved in the control of mating rhythms   <cit> . the latter three genes are potentially important in maintaining temporal reproductive isolation between closely related species, and might be involved in the speciation process in some insects. in fact, rona et al.  <cit>  showed very high differentiation between itaparica and the more southern brazilian populations, including florianópolis, using the timeless gene as a molecular marker.

however, very high fst values were detected in all loci between these two sibling species and they were even higher for rp <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig>  than for timeless, clock and cycle . mazzoni et al.  <cit>  found similar results in a multilocus analysis between two sand fly vectors of leishmaniasis.

no indication of migration was found in either direction in the multiple im simulations, which was consistent with the very high differentiation values for all loci. itaparica also presented lower levels of variability than those from florianópolis, possibly indicating a smaller population size. this is confirmed by im results, which also indicated a smaller effective population size for itaparica. the estimated difference in population sizes seems coherent, since the southern an. cruzii sibling species found in florianópolis is distributed throughout most of the southern and southeastern brazilian atlantic forest  while the northeastern sibling species found in itaparica seems to occur only in a more restricted region  <cit> .

the multilocus results corroborate previous data  <cit>  indicating that these populations represent two different species in the an. cruzii complex. this was also confirmed by nj trees, which show that florianópolis and itaparica are clearly separated in two isolated groups, except perhaps in the case of cycle which suggests persistence of ancestral polymorphisms in florianópolis. however, this gene fragment presents a very small number of variable sites in the itaparica sample.

the estimated divergence time from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya, based on the im results, corresponds to the end of the pliocene and beginning of the pleistocene  <cit> . significant climate changes, including the onset of heavy northern hemisphere glaciation, around  <dig>  mya, occurred at the end of the pliocene  <cit> . a very important consequence of this cooling was an extensive increase in aridification, which lead to fragmentation of forests, including the brazilian atlantic forest  <cit> . interestingly, carnaval et al.  <cit>  discussed the hypothesis of refugia for neotropical species occurring in the atlantic forest. itaparica is located in an area proposed to be a large central refugium in the brazilian atlantic forest and another refugium is proposed in the southern and southeastern brazil. climate changes have been proposed to explain the differentiation among many groups such as fruit flies  <cit> , insect vectors  <cit>  as well as many forest-obligate species  <cit> . since an. cruzii is endemic to the atlantic forest, it seems likely that differentiation between its populations might have occurred due to forest fragmentation, which might have split a single ancestral species into two or more isolated groups.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the multilocus analysis corroborate previous data indicating that florianópolis and itaparica represent two different species of the an. cruzii complex and suggest that they have not exchanged migrants since their separation between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya.
