BACKGROUND
inflammatory bowel diseases  are immune mediated diseases that result because of a complex interaction between genetics and the environment. over  <dig>  million people in the us and europe suffer from ibd. environmental factors that contribute to ibd development include the composition of the normal bacterial flora  <cit>  and perhaps vitamin d. a major source of vitamin d results from its manufacture via a photolysis reaction in the skin and vitamin d available from sunlight exposure is significantly less in northern climates, and especially low during the winter  <cit> . in addition dietary intake of vitamin d is problematic since there are few foods, which are naturally rich in vitamin d. there is evidence for a link between vitamin d availability and the prevalence of immune mediated diseases in general and ibd in particular  <cit> . in addition, experimental models of ibd are more severe in vitamin d receptor  ko and vitamin d deficient models  <cit> . vitamin d is likely an environmental factor that affects the development of ibd.

t cells have been shown to express the vdr, and t cells are both direct and indirect targets of vitamin d. in addition, the active form of vitamin d 2d3) suppressed the development of experimental models of t cell mediated diseases including ibd, multiple sclerosis and type- <dig> diabetes  <cit> . conversely, vitamin d deficiency and/or vdr deficiency resulted in an exacerbation of experimental ibd  <cit> . expression of the vdr does not affect the development of normal numbers of cd <dig> and cd8αβ t cells in the thymus or in the periphery  <cit> . vdr ko cd4+ t cells express more il- <dig>  and ifn-γ, proliferate more rapidly in a mixed lymphocyte reaction and induce more severe colitis than wt cd <dig> cells  <cit> . mice with vdr specific ko in t cells have increased incidence of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and vdr expression in t cells was shown to be essential for the effectiveness of  <dig> d <dig> for the suppression of disease  <cit> .  <dig> d3in vitro suppressed the proliferation of both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells and inhibited the production of ifn-γ, and il- <dig>  <cit> . vitamin d is required for the development of two regulatory cell populations: nkt cells and cd8αα expressing t cells  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> d <dig> induces cd4+ t regulatory cells in vitro and in vivo <cit> . resting and activated cd8+ t cells have been shown to express higher levels of the vdr than cd4+ t cells; however, the physiological role of vitamin d and the vdr in regulating cd8+ t cell function has not been examined  <cit> .

cd8+ t cells can be pathogenic, protective or tolerogenic. pathogenic and protective cd8+ t cells share common features including ifn-γ and tnf-α production as well as cytotoxicity  <cit> . a pathogenic role for cd8+ t cells has been shown for ibd  <cit> . heat shock protein-specific cd8+ t cells transferred severe symptoms of ibd in immunodeficient mice due to the production of ifn-γ and tnf-α  <cit> . conversely, several cd8+ t cell subsets have been shown to act in a suppressive or regulatory manner. cd8+ t cells that do not express cd <dig> , but produced il- <dig> in human peripheral blood, suppressed cytotoxic activity and proliferation in vitro <cit> . in mice, il- <dig> and tgf-β producing cd8/cd28− regulatory t cells inhibited experimental ibd development in the t cell transfer model of ibd  <cit> . human cd8/cxcr3+ cells are a second population of human regulatory cd8+ t cells  <cit> . like the cd8/cd28− t cells, the mouse homologs of the human cd8/cxcr3+ t cells  suppressed the development of t cell-transfer colitis via the production of il- <dig>  <cit> . lastly, cd8αα+tcrαβ+ cells found in the intraepithelial lymphocytes  of the small intestine  have il- <dig> mediated regulatory abilities and can suppress development of t cell-transfer colitis  <cit> . in experimental ibd cd8+ t cells can either cause or protect from disease development.

here we determined the effects of vitamin d on cd8αβ+ t cells. vdr ko mice had increased numbers of naïve cd8+ t cells that when purified and then transferred to rag ko recipients induced colitis as determined by histological staining. in addition, co-transfer of vdr ko cd8+ t cells with naïve wt cd4+ cells accelerated the development of colitis in rag ko recipients. the cause of the vdr ko cd8+ t cell pathogenicity was due to the uncontrolled proliferation of cd8+ t cells in general and naïve cd8+ t cells in particular. in addition, vdr ko cd8+ t cells overproduced il- <dig>  the rapidly dividing vdr ko cd8+ t cells accumulated in the gut where they induced ifn-γ and il- <dig> production.

methods
mice
wt, vdr ko, il- <dig> ko, il-10/vdr double  ko and rag ko mice all on the c57bl/ <dig> background were bred in the animal facilities at the pennsylvania state university . the original vdr ko breeders were a gift from dr. marie demay  and the dko mice were generated as previously described  <cit> . all other breeders were originally from jackson laboratories . experimental procedures were approved by the office of research protection institutional animal care and use committee at the pennsylvania state university.

t cell isolation
cd4+ or cd8+ t cells were purified from the spleen using the mouse cd4+ or cd8+ recovery column kit and the manufacturer’s instructions . column purification was followed by cell sorting  of cd4+, cd8+, cd4+cd45rbhigh, cd8+cd28+/-, cd8+cd122+ t cell subsets. post-sorting analysis confirmed that the purity of the t cells was >99% . iels were isolated for analyses by removing the peyer’s patches and splitting the si lengthwise followed by cutting the si into  <dig>  cm pieces. the pieces were incubated twice in hbss containing  <dig>  μg/ml dithiothreitol and 5%fbs  for 20 min at 37°c under 200 rpm rotation. the iel were collected from the interface of 40/80% percoll gradients .

adoptive transfer
all transfers used t cells from the spleens of the donor mice. groups of rag ko mice were injected intraperitoneally  with  <dig> ×  <dig> cd8+ cells or cd <dig> t cell sorted subsets  from wt, vdr ko, il- <dig> ko or il-10/vdr dko mice. sorting purity and gating strategies are in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  for the co-transfer experiments, rag ko mice were injected i.p. with  <dig> ×  <dig> wt or vdr ko  cd8+ t cells on day - <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> wt  cd4+cd45rbhigh cells on day  <dig>  both cd <dig> and cd4+cd45rbhigh cells were resuspended in 200 μl pbs. the rag ko recipients were weighed weekly and euthanized after  <dig> or  <dig> wks.

colitis development
colitis symptoms measured included: weight loss, colon/body weight  ratios, histopathology scores, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and rectal prolapse exactly as described  <cit> . 1 cm of the distal colon was fixed in formalin and sent to the penn state university animal diagnostic laboratories  for sectioning and haematoxylin & eosin  staining. inflammation and epithelial injury of the colons were scored blindly by two individuals for inflammation  and epithelial hyperplasia   <cit> . total histopathology scores ranged from 0- <dig> 

brdu incorporation assay
rag ko mice were injected i.p. with 50 μl of 25 mg/ml brdu dissolved in pbs every two days. the mice were euthanized at d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> and the mln and iel were fixed with ice-cold 95% ethanol and paraformaldehyde digested with dnasei solution .

flow cytometry
cells were stained with: fitc anti-cd8α, fitc anti-cd8β, fitc anti-cd45rb, pe anti-cd <dig> , pe anti-cd <dig>  pe anti-cd <dig>  pe anti-cd <dig>  pe anti-cd <dig>  pe anti-cd <dig>  pe-texas red  anti-cd <dig>  pecy <dig> anti-cd62l, pecy <dig> anti-tcrβ and pecy <dig> anti-cd8α  for surface markers. gating strategies for facs analysis are shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  for brdu incorporation assays, cells were stained with biotin anti-brdu, fitc streptavidin and biotin mouse igg <dig>  κ isotype control . for intracellular cytokine staining, iel were stimulated with pma , ionomycin  and brefeldin a  for 6 h, fixed with 4% paraformadehyde , permeabilized with  <dig> % saponin , and stained with fitc anti-ifnγ, pe anti-il-17a, or the fitc/pe labeled rat igg <dig> isotype controls . flow cytometry was done on a fc <dig> bench top cytometer  and the data was analyzed with flowjo  <dig> . <dig> software .

cell culture and cfse staining
purified cd8+ t cells were labeled with cfse using cell trave cfse cell proliferation kit . the labeled cd8+ t cells  were cultured with plate bound anti-cd <dig>  and anti-cd <dig>  or  <dig>  μg/ml recombinant il- <dig> with/without neutralizing il- <dig> antibodies . supernatants were collected from 3d cultures of unstimulated or cd3/cd <dig> stimulated cd8+ t cells, and il- <dig> in the supernatant was evaluated using an elisa kit and the manufacturer’s instructions .

quantitative real-time pcr
total rna was isolated from si and colon of mice following the manufacturer’s instructions . cdna was synthesized by using the taqman reverse transcription reagents kit  and was amplified for cytokines ifn-γ, il-17a and il- <dig> with sybr green mix  by myiq single-color real-time pcr machine . expression levels of these cytokines were normalized by gapdh and calculated by using ΔΔct method .

statistics
statistical analyses were performed by graphpad . data are presented as mean ± sem values from two or three experiments. unpaired student’s t test, and anovas with bonferroni post-hoc tests were used to calculate statistical significance. values are significantly different with p-values of *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , and ***p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
cd8+ t cells from vdr ko mice transfer ibd to rag ko recipients
cd8+ t cells from wt and il- <dig> ko mice did not induce colitis when transferred to rag ko recipients and histopathology of the colons from rag ko mice that received  <dig> wt or il- <dig> ko cd8+ t cells were normal . conversely, rag ko mice that received  <dig> vdr ko or il-10/vdr dko cd8+ t cells showed severe inflammation in the colon including hyperplasia and infiltration of immune cells . the rag ko mice that received cd8+ t cells from dko mice lost a significant amount of their starting bw by  <dig> wks . in fact the rag ko recipients of dko cd8+ t cells developed a fulminating form of ibd that resembled the ibd that develops in the dko mice  <cit> . rag ko mice that received no cells  gained weight over the  <dig> wk study and rag ko mice that received wt, vdr ko and il- <dig> ko cd8+ t cells maintained their bw . none of the over  <dig> rag ko recipients of vdr ko cd8+ t cells lost weight even though the mice had intense inflammation in both the colon and si . the colon showed the greatest degree of inflammation following transfer of vdr ko cd8+ t cells to rag ko recipients.

in order to determine what the differences were between vdr ko and wt cd8+ t cells, the cd8+ t cells were characterized from wt and vdr ko mice. there was a higher frequency of naïve  and cd8/cd28− cells and a lower frequency of activated  and cd8/cd122+ cells in the spleen of vdr ko compared to wt mice . cd25+ expression on cd8+ t cells was low and less than 2% of the cd8+ t cells in vdr ko and wt mice expressed cd <dig> . in addition, there was no difference between expression of cd <dig> on vdr ko and wt cd8+ t cells . there was no difference in the total number of splenocytes isolated from wt and vdr ko mice and therefore changes in frequency also resulted in changes in absolute numbers of cells. the frequency of granzyme b+ cells was not different in cd3/cd <dig> activated vdr ko and wt cd8+ t cells . il- <dig> and il- <dig> were undetectable while ifn-γ was not different in the supernatants from cd3/cd <dig> activated vdr ko and wt cd8+ t cells . the finding of more regulatory cd8/cd28− and less regulatory cd8/cd122+ from the vdr ko mice was followed up by doing additional transfers to rag ko mice using purified populations of these regulatory cell types.

rag ko recipients of  <dig> sorted wt cd8/cd28− or cd8/cd28+ t cells weighed the same as the ctrl rag ko mice that did not receive any cells . conversely, rag ko recipients of  <dig> sorted vdr ko cd8/cd28− or cd8/cd28+ t cells lost significantly more weight than the ctrl and wt cd <dig> t cell recipients . sorted  <dig> cd8/cd122+ t cell transfers from either wt or vdr ko mice did not induce weight loss or colitis in rag ko recipients . histopathology of colonic tissue from rag ko recipients of vdr ko cd8+ subsets  showed significantly more inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia than ctrl . histopathology of colonic tissue from rag ko recipients of wt cd8+ subsets  was not different from ctrl . increased colitis in rag ko recipients of vdr ko cd8+ t cells is not a result of a difference in the cd28+/− subpopulations.

vdr ko cd8+ t cells accelerate cd4/cd45rbhigh cell-mediated colitis
the effect of cd8+ t cells on cd4/cd45rbhigh  t cell induced colitis in rag ko recipients was examined. rag ko mice were injected with  <dig> sorted cd8+ t cells from cd <dig> + vdr ko or cd <dig> + wt mice. the next day, the same rag ko mice were injected with sorted  <dig> ×  <dig> wt naïve cd <dig> +/cd <dig> t cells to induce colitis. rag ko recipients of only naïve cd <dig> t cells  lost 10% of their original bw, and weighed significantly less than the ctrl mice at  <dig> wks post-transfer . weight loss in the rag ko recipients of naïve wt cd <dig> cells plus wt cd <dig> t cells  was no different from the recipients of cd <dig> only t cells . rag ko recipients of naïve wt cd <dig> plus vdr ko cd <dig> t cells  lost 20% of their original bw, which was significantly more weight loss than any other group . the colon/bw% was lowest in the ctrl, intermediate in the cd <dig> only and cd4 + wtcd <dig> groups and highest in the cd4 + kocd <dig> group . the histopathology scores from rag ko recipients of cd4 + kocd <dig> t cells were  <dig>  ±  <dig> , which was significantly higher than the scores for all other groups . cd8+ t cells from vdr ko mice produced twice as much ifn-γ and il-17a than wt cd8+ t in the iel of rag ko recipients . in addition, the rag ko recipients of cd4 + kocd <dig> t cells had significantly more total ifn-γ and il-17a producing cells in the iel than recipients of cd4 + wtcd <dig> t cells . the same mice from figure  <dig> were used to measure the expression of il-17a and ifn-γ mrna . il-17a and ifn-γ mrna expression was higher in both the si and colon of the rag ko recipients of cd4 + kocd <dig> t cells than the rag ko recipients of cd4 + wtcd <dig> t cells . rag ko recipients of cd8+ t cells from vdr ko mice had more ifn-γ and il-17a in the si and colon that corresponded to the increased severity of naïve cd4+ t cell induced colitis.

increased cd8+, but reduced naive cd4+ t cells in vdr ko cell recipients
the mln and iel of the si were used to determine the origin of t cells in the gastrointestinal tract of the rag ko recipients. the mln and iel were used since these tissues normally have high frequencies of t cells and can demonstrate the extent of immune reconstitution of rag ko mice following t cell transfer. 70 ± 5% of the iel in rag ko recipients of only cd <dig> cells were the donor cd4/cd <dig> + t cells . the remaining cells in the iel  were the resident rag ko iel cells  that did not express cd <dig>  or cd8β. in the rag ko recipients of cd4 + wtcd <dig> cells, 36 ± 5% of the iel were cd4+ cells  and 33 ± 4% were cd8αβ  t cells such that together 69% of the iel in the recipient were t cells . the rag ko recipients of the cd4 + kocd <dig> cells had fewer cd4+ cells  and more cd8αβ cells  than the other groups of mice . the reconstitution of the mln mirrored the iel in that the recipients of cd4 + wtcd <dig> cells had approximately equal representation of cd <dig> and cd8αβ cells in the mln while the mice that received cd4 + kocd <dig> cells had significantly more cd8+ than cd4+ t cells in the mln . there were no differences in the total frequency of cd8αα+ expressing t cells  in the iel of the rag ko recipients of cd4 + wtcd <dig> or cd4 + kocd <dig> t cells . significantly more cd8+ t cells were recovered in the mln and iel of cd4 + kocd <dig> than cd4 + wtcd <dig> t cell transferred rag ko recipient mice.

increased proliferation of vdr ko cd8+ t cells in vivo
based on the finding of increased numbers  of vdr ko cd <dig> cells in the iel and mln following co-transfer to rag ko mice; additional experiments were done to determine whether vdr ko cd <dig> t cells proliferate more rapidly than wt cd <dig> t cells. sorted cd8+ t cells were detectable in the mln of rag ko recipients on d <dig> following transfer . conversely, there were no t cells found in the iel after 3 days . at d <dig> in the mln most of the cd8+ t cells from either wt or vdr ko donors were undergoing division . there were two distinct populations of brdu+ cells in the mln; one with low-mean fluorescence intensity  and the other one with high-mfi . 61 ± 3% of vdr ko cd8+ t cells were of the brdu high-mfi phenotype and only 41 ± 2% of the wt cd8+ t cells were brdu high-mfi . on d <dig> there were also more high-mfi profile vdr ko cd8+ t cells  than wt cd8+ t cells . by day  <dig> in the mln there was a small population  of brdu very high-mfi vdr ko cd8+ t cells and significantly less of these cells in the wt cd8+ t recipients . cd8+ t cells appeared in the iel on d <dig> . significantly fewer cells were brdu high-mfi in the iel of rag ko recipients of wt cd8+ t cells  than vdr ko cd8+ t cells . there were also two distinct peaks of brdu incorporation evident at d <dig> in the iel samples and again the high-mfi peak was over represented in the recipients of vdr ko cd8+ t cells . total vdr ko cd8+ t cells were proliferating faster than wt cd8+ t cells in vivo.

to identify which t cell subsets were undergoing rapid proliferation in the rag ko recipients, the brdu mfi-high cells from figure 4a were phenotyped. naïve cd8+ t cells  from vdr ko mice proliferated more than their wt counterparts in the mln and iel on d <dig> and d <dig> post-transfer . conversely, activated cd8+ t cells  from vdr ko mice proliferated at the same rate  as activated cells from wt mice post-transfer . more naïve vdr ko cd8+ t cells than naïve wt cd8+ t cells were proliferating rapidly in vivo.

increased proliferation of vdr ko cd8+ t cells in vitro
proliferation of the cd8+ t cells from vdr ko and wt mice was also tested in vitro. even though there was very little proliferation detected in the cd3/cd <dig> stimulated cultures at d <dig>  vdr ko cd8+ t cells had  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the cells proliferating while none of the wt cd8+ t cells were proliferating . on d <dig> there were two rounds of proliferation evident in the wt cd8+ t cell cultures and three rounds of proliferation in the vdr ko cd8+ t cell cultures . in addition, there were significantly more vdr ko cd8+ t cells proliferating  compared to wt cd8+ t cells  at d <dig>  by d <dig> almost all of the cells in both cultures had proliferated and there were no longer significant differences in the frequency of cd8+ t cells that had undergone proliferation . vdr ko cd8+ t cells were proliferating faster than wt cd8+ t cells in vitro.

the cfse stained cells in panel a were also stained to look at naïve and activated cells in the cultures. on day  <dig> significantly more of the naïve  cd8+ t cells from vdr ko mice had proliferated in response to cd3/cd <dig> stimulation than wt . by day  <dig> the naive vdr ko cd8+ t cells were proliferating rapidly in the presence and absence of cd3/cd <dig> stimulation while the naïve wt cd8+ t cells were not . the naïve vdr ko cd8+ cells were dividing but not downregulating cd62l and upregulating cd <dig> . cd8+ t cells with an activated phenotype  proliferated strongly in both the wt and vdr ko cultures at both d <dig> and d <dig> post-stimulation and there were no differences between the proliferation of the activated vdr ko and wt cd8+ t cells . phenotypically naïve vdr ko cd8+ t cells proliferated with or without stimulation but did not express activation markers as a result of proliferation.

vdr ko cd8+ t cells over-produce and respond to il- <dig> robustly
the role of il- <dig> in the increased proliferation of vdr ko cd8+ t cells was determined. cd <dig> expression was not different on vdr ko and wt cd8+ t cells . 3 days of culture were required in order to detect proliferation of cd8+ t cells in response to il- <dig> . 24 ± 3% of wt cd <dig> t cells and 50 ± 4% of vdr ko cd8+ t cells divided at d <dig> following addition of il- <dig> . addition of il- <dig> plus il- <dig> neutralizing antibodies prevented all of the wt cd8+ t cell proliferation while vdr ko cd8+ t cells still had 6 ± 2% undergoing proliferation in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to il- <dig> . the supernatants from cd8+ t cells cultures stimulated with cd <dig> and cd <dig> antibodies were evaluated for the production of il- <dig>  unstimulated vdr ko and wt cd8+ t cells did not produce detectable il- <dig> after 3 days in culture . cd3/cd <dig> stimulated vdr ko cd8+ t cells produced 2-fold more il- <dig> than wt cd8+ t cells . overproduction of il- <dig> contributes to the more rapid proliferation of cd3/cd <dig> activated vdr ko cd8+ t cells.

discussion
vdr ko cd8+ t cells proliferated more rapidly both in vitro and in vivo. the increased rate of proliferation following activation was associated with the over production of il- <dig> from the cd8+ t cells themselves. the rapidly proliferating naïve donor vdr ko cd8+ t cells found residence in the mln first and then in the iel of the rag ko mice where they out-competed the cd4+ t cells and contributed to colitis development by inducing il-17a and ifn-γ production. in rag ko recipients of wt cd8+ t cells endogenously produced  <dig> d <dig> slowed down the proliferation of the t cells, while the vdr ko cd8+ t cells could not respond to  <dig> d <dig>  the  <dig> d <dig> also acted on wt cd8+ t cells to inhibit il- <dig> and ifn- γ responses. in vdr ko mice the cd8+ t cells with a naïve phenotype were over-represented but their proliferation must have been controlled since vdr ko mice did not develop overt colitis symptoms  <cit> . vdr ko mice had normal foxp3+ t regulatory cells that may have prevented the naïve cd8+ t cells from expanding and causing colitis  <cit> . naïve cd8+ vdr ko t cells divided in vitro even in the absence of stimulation . this is unique to the vdr ko cd8+ t cells, since naïve cd4+ vdr ko t cells proliferated at the same rate as naïve cd4+ wt t cells . proliferation was not associated with upregulation of activation markers since the proliferating cd8+ t cells were still cd62lhigh/cd44low. vdr expression must be required for the quiescence of naïve cd8+ t cells.

naïve and memory cd8+ t cells use different cytokines to regulate proliferation  <cit> . the proliferation of naïve t cells requires il- <dig> receptor  α, but not il-15; conversely, memory t cells use either il-7rα or il- <dig> for proliferation  <cit> . it would be difficult to envision how this differential use of il- <dig> versus il- <dig> could account for the increased proliferation of predominately naïve cd8+ t cells. instead it may be that developmentally the vdr is required to control the proliferation rate of the naïve cd8+ t cells but not the differentiated effector or memory cells. somewhat surprisingly cd8+ t cells from vdr ko mice produced the same amounts of granzyme b and ifn-γ as wt cd8+ t cells . instead, cd8+ t cells from vdr ko mice overproduced il- <dig> that may act in a paracrine manner on the cd8+ t cells themselves.

the original function of  <dig> d <dig> in the immune system was shown to be as a suppressor of mitogen induced proliferation  <cit> . those early studies established that  <dig> d <dig> suppressed t cell proliferation in both cd4+ and cd8+ by blocking transition of the cycling cells from early g <dig> to late g <dig>  <cit> . in addition, il- <dig> was shown to be a target of  <dig> d <dig> treatments and  <dig> d <dig> inhibited production of il- <dig>  <cit> . the inhibition of il- <dig> expression was due to the direct interaction of the vdr/ <dig> d <dig> complex that blocked the binding of the nfatp/ap <dig> complex to the il- <dig> promoter  <cit> . the effects of  <dig> d <dig> on il- <dig> contributed to the suppression of t cell proliferation by  <dig> d <dig> but proliferation of  <dig> d <dig> treated t cells was only partially reversed by exogenous il- <dig> addition  <cit> . administration of exogenous il- <dig> can increase the frequency of cd8+ memory cells  <cit> . autocrine il- <dig> secretion by memory cd8+ t cells has been shown to be a critical mechanism to maintain the cd8+ t cells  <cit> . the data in the vdr ko cd8+ t cells suggest that the vdr must participate as a negative co-regulator of proliferation and il- <dig> production in cd8+ t cells. the data further suggest that expression of the vdr may be important in regulation of the memory cd8+ response.

vitamin d serves as a regulator of proliferation across many different cell types. in addition to inhibiting the proliferation of t cells,  <dig> d <dig> inhibits the proliferation of keratinocytes, b cells, epithelial cells and several different types of cancer cells  <cit> . topical  <dig> d <dig> inhibits proliferation and induces resolution of psoriasis  <cit> . in addition, vitamin d deficiency is associated with an increase in several different types of cancer  <cit> . vdr ko mice have increased epithelial cell proliferation in the gastrointestinal tract and skin  <cit> . more recently we have shown that in the immune system control of homeostatic proliferation and apoptosis underlie the basic mechanisms whereby vitamin d regulates tcrαβ/cd8αα and inkt cell numbers  <cit> . vitamin d and the vdr seem to be master regulators of proliferation across many cell types. in cd8+ t cells there is a selective requirement for vdr signaling to control the numbers of naïve cd8+ t cells in the periphery.

vdr ko cd8+ t cells induce colitis in the rag ko recipients. however, the rag ko recipients of vdr ko cd8+ t cells did not lose weight or develop overt symptoms of experimental ibd, suggesting that there must be some regulatory cell or cytokine being produced to limit the pathogenicity of the cells. there did not appear to be any cd28− or cd122+ regulatory cell in the vdr ko cd8+ t cells. confirming the literature the rag ko recipients of il- <dig> ko cd8+ t cells did not induce colitis  <cit> . however, il-10/vdr dko cd8+ t cells induced a fulminating form of ibd including rectal bleeding, and significant weight loss. therefore it seems that autocrine il- <dig> production by cd8+ t cells prevents overt colitis induced by vdr ko cd8+ t cells.

the vdr is critical for controlling the rate of proliferation of naïve cd8+ t cells and the ability of the cd8+ t cells to both produce and respond to il- <dig>  in the absence of vitamin d signaling rapidly proliferating cd8+ t cells accumulate in the gut and contribute to the production of il- <dig> and ifn-γ. autocrine production of il- <dig> limits vdr ko cd8+ t cell- induced colitis. in the t cell transfer model of ibd other regulatory cells are absent that might inhibit the proliferation of the vdr ko cd8+ t cells to control inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. expression of the vdr halts the nonspecific expansion of the naïve cd8+ t cells. vitamin d control of the cd8+ t cell response contributes to the maintenance of gastrointestinal homeostasis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, vdr-deficiency results in the generation of pathogenic cd8+ t cells that contributes to the development of ibd. the causes of the vdr ko cd8+ t cell induced ibd was the rapid proliferation of cd8+ t cells in general and naïve cd8+ t cells in particular, and the overproduction and response to il- <dig>  expression of the vdr prevents homeostatic proliferation of cd8+ t cells and vitamin d through the vdr maintains gastrointestinal homeostasis.
