BACKGROUND
the root of panax notoginseng  f. h. chen, also known as radix notoginseng or sanchi, is a well-known traditional chinese medicine belonging to the genus panax and family araliaceae. p. notoginseng has been cultivated and used medicinally since ancient times for its remarkable and valuable hemostatic effects  <cit> . this species is not normally found in the wild, but is cultivated commercially in wenshan county , and jingxi county , china  <cit> . clinical trials indicate that p. notoginseng root extracts possess anti-hypertensive, anti-oxidant, anti-thrombotic, anti-atherosclerotic, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective properties .

the principal bioactive constituents of the herb are triterpene saponins, which are dammarane-type glycosides . more than  <dig> variant dammarane-type saponins have been isolated and identified from p. notoginseng including notoginsenosides, ginsenosides, and gypenosides  <cit> . however, the oleanane-type saponin ginsenoside ro has not been isolated from this species, although it exists in other major panax plants such as p. ginseng and p. quinquefolius  <cit> . the p. notoginseng saponins  mainly contain ginsenoside rg <dig>  ginsenoside rb <dig>  and notoginsenoside r <dig> according to the chinese pharmacopoeia . pns content and composition differs between tissues and plant age, with the highest pns levels found in roots  <cit> .

although the pharmacological importance of pns is well established, the biosynthetic enzymes involved in their synthesis and their regulation is not fully understood. as steroids involved in plant defense they are thought to derive from pathways that lead to the synthesis of isoprenoids. these precursors of pns are synthesized by the mevalonic acid  pathway in the cytosol and the methylerythritol phosphate  pathway in the plastid, resulting in the synthesis of  <dig> -oxidosqualene  <cit> . subsequent modification of  <dig> - by multiple oxidations  and glycosylation results in a wide variety of pnss. although most of mva-pathway genes in p. notoginseng have not been functionally characterized, their corresponding sequence homologues have been identified. recently a large-scale transcriptome analysis of p. notoginseng leaves, roots and flowers identified  <dig> unigenes putatively involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis and a large number of cytochrome p <dig> and glycosyltransferease-like genes that may be involved conversion of triterpene saponin backbone into different pnss  <cit> .

micrornas , which are approximately 19– <dig> nucleotides in length, are a class of small endogenous non-coding rnas  that originate from primary transcripts of stem–loop structures  <cit> . in plants, mirnas regulate target gene expression either through direct endonucleolytic cleavage or translational inhibition at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> ; under certain circumstances, they lead to methylation at the transcriptional level . increasing evidence indicates that mirnas play important regulatory roles in diverse biological and metabolic processes such as plant development, abiotic stress responses, and pathogen defense  <cit> .

plant mirnas have been studied extensively using computational and experimental methods since the discovery of arabidopsis mirnas in  <dig> . to date, a total of  <dig>  mature mirna sequences from  <dig> different species  have been identified according to the mirbase database . however, there is currently no available information about p. notoginseng mirnas. in this study, three srna libraries from p. notoginseng roots of different ages were constructed and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing  . we identified a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas from the three srna datasets. to investigate the functions of the novel mirnas, the cluster of orthologous groups  annotation, gene ontology  enrichment analysis, and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway mapping of predicted targets were performed  <cit> . finally, the expression of six mirnas was validated in the root samples and their expression patterns at different developmental stages and in different tissues of p. notoginseng were determined using quantitative reverse transcription -pcr.

RESULTS
triterpene saponin content analysis
high-performance liquid chromatography  was performed on 1-, 2- and 3-year-old p. notoginseng root, stem, and leaf samples to quantify saponin levels. as expected, the levels of p. notoginseng saponins ginsenoside rg <dig>  ginsenoside rb <dig>  and notoginsenoside r <dig> were highest in the roots, with a large increase observed in saponin content between 1-year-old  and 2-year-old  roots. the highest saponin levels were found in 3-year-old roots  . stem pns levels displayed an inverse concentration profile to roots, with decreasing levels of saponin seen with increasing age. leaf samples possessed the lowest pns levels compared with root and stem samples, with the highest pns levels found in 2y samples. pairwise analyses identified significant differences between triterpene saponin levels of root samples in different years , with the exception of r <dig> levels between 2y and 1y roots.

features of p. notoginseng srna populations
to examine p. notoginseng root mirnas, three srna libraries were generated from 1y, 2y, and 3y old root  samples. the libraries were sequenced by illumina srna deep sequencing technology. sequences of the  <dig> libraries were combined and then analyzed the features of mirnas and identified novel and conserved mirnas. in total,  <dig> , <dig> raw root sequence reads were obtained. after removing contaminants, low quality sequences, and those reads shorter than 18 nt,  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads of 18–30 nt were used for further analysis . among the selected reads,  <dig> , <dig> sequences from p. notoginseng roots mapped perfectly to the transcriptome, amounting to  <dig>  %, of the total reads . additionally,  <dig> , <dig> reads in p. notoginseng roots were found to be highly similar to previously identified mirnas from other species. the remaining sequences consisted of other rna types, including non-coding rna, transfer rna, ribosomal rna, small nuclear rna, small nucleolar rna, and novel mirnas . the size distributions of srnas were uneven between the three root libraries, but the majority ranged in length from 20–24 nt .table  <dig> statistics of high-through sequencing results of panax notoginseng small rnas

identification of conserved p. notoginseng root mirnas
to investigate the expression of conserved mirnas in p. notoginseng root, srna sequences from the three root libraries were compared with known mature mirnas and precursors in mirbase  <dig> . a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas  were identified in p. notoginseng from these three srna datasets . the frequency of these mirnas varied widely between families. in most mirna families, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  only one conserved member was identified. however, some mirna families possessed several members. for example, mir <dig> was the largest family identified, with twenty four members, whereas twenty members were found in the mir <dig> family, followed by mir <dig>  in which sixteen members were identified. the frequency of these mirnas varied significantly between different mirna families, with some having fewer than  <dig> sequence reads, while others possessed hundreds of thousands of reads.

the proportion of different categories of srnas often reflects the roles they play in a particular tissue or at different developmental stages, and their associated biological mechanisms . the following  <dig> mirnas were highly abundant in the combined library: mir156n, mir156j, mir156g, mir156q, mir156b, mir <dig>  mir156i, mir166s, mir166l-3p, mir166k, mir166m, mir166u and mir166e. each of these  <dig> mirnas possessed more than  <dig>  reads, whereas the majority of other mirnas sequenced had approximately  <dig> reads. according to the sequence data, mir156i  and mir156g  were the most abundant mirnas in p. notoginseng roots.

identification of novel mirnas in p. notoginseng root
to identify novel mirnas that may be specific to p. notoginseng, all unannotated srnas were searched against the publically available  <dig>  unigene p. notoginseng transcriptome using mireap software. after searching for potential precursors  and predicting their stem–loop hairpin secondary structures, a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in the three libraries . the novel mirna sequences ranged in length from 20–23 nt, with a mode of 21 nt. the pre-mirnas ranged in length from 72–363 nt, with an average of 122 nt. the average minimum folding free energy value of the hairpin structures was − <dig>  kcal/mol in p. notoginseng, which is higher than that found in arabidopsis   <cit> . the structures of  <dig> new mirna precursors are shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  mirna lengths and nucleotide preference distributions indicated that most mirnas started with a 5′-u not 5′-g, which is consistent with typical mirna sequence patterns  <cit> .

target prediction and functional annotation
we used psrna target software to predict putative target genes of novel and conserved mirnas. a total of  <dig> putative target genes were identified in p. notoginseng roots . a total of  <dig> target gene sequences could be assigned to cog classifications, the database of orthologous gene products  <cit> , and were classified into  <dig> groups. the largest of these groups was ‘general function prediction only’ followed by ‘transcription’ . go annotation enrichment showed that the most significantly enriched of biological_processes, cellular_components, and molecular_functions were metabolic process, cell/cell part, and binding, respectively . overall,  <dig> different pathways enriched with mirna targets were found in p. notoginseng, and the most enriched included metabolic pathways , spliceosome  and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites  .fig.  <dig> cog function classification of mirna targets in panax notoginseng

analysis of both novel and conserved mirnas identified four mirnas that were computationally predicted to target genes associated with the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a synthetase , catalyses the reaction of acetoacetyl-coenzyme a to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, the first committed enzyme of the mevalonate  pathway was predicted to be targeted by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  mir <dig> was predicted to target all-trans-nonaprenyl diphosphate synthase , which may be involved with geranyl diphosphate synthase . gps catalyses the condensation reaction of isopentenyl diphosphate  and dimethylallyl diphosphate , which product is geranyl diphosphate , the entry to the formation of terpene moiety. finally, the putative target gene of novel_mir_ <dig> was predicted to be 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase , the first rate-limiting enzyme for sesquiterpene synthesis in the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate  pathway in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. the synthesis of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate  is catalyzed by the enzyme dxs.

mirnas differentially expressed in p. notoginseng root
pairwise analysis of the mirna abundance between root libraries identified  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  significantly differentially expressed mirnas  between 2y–1y, 3y–1y, and 3y–2y root samples, respectively . interestingly, different expression levels were also observed among different members of the same mirna family, namely those involved in tissue- or development stage-specific expression. for example, two members of the mir <dig> family, mir156a and mir157a-3p, exhibited significantly differential expression between 2y–1y, although the fold-changes were lower at − <dig>  and − <dig>  log <dig> ratio, respectively.

qrt-pcr validation and analysis of six mirnas in p. notoginseng
to validate the data obtained from high-throughput sequencing, two significantly differentially expressed mirnas  and four mirnas  predicted to target genes involved in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway were selected and their expression levels quantified using stem–loop qrt-pcr . the results were consistent with deep sequencing data . the majority of analyzed mirnas showed age- and tissue-specific expression with predominant expression in the roots . for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig> exhibited the lowest expression in roots of 3y plants, while mir157f-3p and novel_mir_ <dig> showed high expression in 3y roots and relatively low expression in 1y and 2y roots. this indicates that developmental stage-specific regulation of mirna expression occurs in p. notoginseng.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of mirnas in panax notoginseng. relative expression of mirnas in roots , stems  and leaves  are shown. reference gene was 18s rrna. normalized mirna levels in 1y roots were arbitrarily set to 1



in the 1y sample, mir156f-3p, mir157a-3p, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and novel_mir_ <dig> showed very similar expression patterns, with the highest levels expressed in roots, followed by leaves and stems. the expression patterns of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and novel_mir_ <dig> were also similar in the different tissues of 2y plants, with the highest expression observed in roots, followed by stems and leaves. mir156f-3p and mir157a-3p 3y expression patterns were consistent with that of the mir <dig> 2y sample, which showed the same patterns as the 1y sample. mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> of the 3y sample exhibited similar expression patterns, with the lowest levels expressed in roots, followed by leaves and stems.

mir156f-3p and mir157a-3p are members of the same mirna family. their expression patterns were similar in the root and stem tissues of 1y and 3y plants. this implies that a functional relationship exists between mir156f-3p and mir157a-3p in these tissues at this developmental stage. however, their expression patterns differed from that observed in 2y tissues. mir156f-3p showed the highest expression in the stem, the lowest expression in the roots, and moderate expression in the leaves, whereas mir157a-3p exhibited the highest expression in the leaves, followed by the stem and roots. this suggests that mir156f-3p and mir157a-3p could be functionally different at 2y, although they belong to the same family.

discussion
high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic approaches are efficient means for identifying mirnas  <cit> . many conserved plant mirnas have been previously identified, although relatively few have been well characterized  <cit> . in this study, srna profiles from 1y, 2y, and 3y p. notoginseng roots were obtained, which represents the first major examination of mirnas in this species. sequence analysis showed that the majority of srnas ranged in length from 20–24 nt. these results are typical of dicer-processed srna products and in keeping with the known 18–25 nt range for mirnas  <cit> . more than  <dig> million clean reads of 18–30 nt were obtained from each srna library. a total of  <dig> known mirnas  and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in p. notoginseng roots. mir156a was one of frequently sequenced mirnas. mir156a is also expressed abundantly in taxus chinensis  <cit>  and arachis hypogaea  <cit> .

several mirnas were computationally predicted to directly target known genes in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway, including hmgs and dxs. qrt-pcr analysis of these mirnas in root, stem, and leaf material from 1y, 2y, and 3y tissues revealed complex expression profiles that showed good concordance with the sequencing data. mirnas usually negatively regulate the expression of genes, therefore it would be expected that increased levels of a mirna that targets biosynthetic genes in the pns pathway may inversely correlate with pns levels. for stem tissue, levels of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and novel_mir_ <dig> all inversely correlated with total pns content, whereas in leaf tissues mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and novel_mir_ <dig> inversely correlated only with rb <dig> content. however in the roots only mir <dig> inversely correlated with pns content as measured by hplc. however, pns biosynthesis is a complex process involving many triterpene saponins, so it is simplistic to discern simple correlations between mirna expression and saponin content. given the importance of triterpene saponins from p. notoginseng, further characterization of these mirnas is required, because greater understanding of the regulatory mechanism of mirnas in triterpene saponin biosynthesis could facilitate a mirna-based biotechnology for manipulating pns in both in vitro and in vivo systems.

characterization of specific cytochrome p450s  involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis in p. notoginseng will facilitate to elucidation of the triterpene saponin biosynthetic pathway. it is reported that some cyp450s participate in the oxidation of the dammarane skeleton at c- <dig> and the other at c- <dig> toward the production of protopanaxatriol and protopanaxadiol, respectively  <cit> . previous studies have characterized cyp716a <dig> from medicago truncatula   <cit> , which was involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis. therefore, the novel_mir_ <dig> in this paper, one of its putative targets was cyp716a <dig> , which might be a candidate enzyme involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis in p. notoginseng.

target gene prediction in this study showed that mirnas can target transcription factors related to plant growth and development, including squamosa promoter-binding protein-like , apetala <dig> , myeloblastosis related proteins , and wrky proteins. previous research indicated that mirna families in different plants are highly conserved and perform analogous regulatory functions  <cit> . for example, mir <dig> was predicted to target the spl transcription factor, which plays an important part in the developmental transition from the juvenile to adult phase of arabidopsis and from the vegetative to reproductive phase during postembryonic development  <cit> . the ap <dig> transcription factor is involved in flowering time, while mir <dig> regulates arabidopsis floral morphology  <cit> , and targets ap <dig> in p. ginseng  <cit> , brassica oleracea  <cit> , and the opium poppy  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> maintains the juvenile stage and prevents precocious flowering, whereas mir <dig> acts downstream of mir <dig> and promotes flowering  <cit> , and mir <dig> targets and promotes the expression of spl genes that are negative regulators of mir <dig>  <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> exhibit contrasting development-specific expression patterns: the mir <dig> abundance declines during vegetative development, while that of mir <dig> correspondingly increases.

one of the larger groups of plant transcription factors is the myb protein family. members carry a conserved myb dna binding domain and play a regulatory role in developmental processes and defense responses  <cit> . this study suggests that myb proteins might be the target of mir <dig> in p. notoginseng. previous studies have also suggested that this occurs in p. ginseng  <cit>  and b. oleracea  <cit> . additionally, wrky transcription factor family members are key players in responding to bacterial infections, wounding, and other stresses  <cit> . interestingly, certain wrky members are positive regulators of triterpene ginsenoside biosynthesis in p. quinquefolius  <cit> . therefore, the conservation of putative target genes in p. notoginseng suggests that these transcription factors also share the same function in plant growth and development, including in triterpene ginsenoside biosynthesis, although this requires further experimental validation.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study is the first report to examine the mirna expression profiles of p. notoginseng roots. we identified a large number of conserved and novel mirnas in p. notoginseng, as well as their target genes, functional annotations, and gene expression patterns. four mirnas were computationally predicted to directly target known genes in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. further investigation concerning the functions of these mirnas should facilitate our understanding of the regulatory roles of mirnas in regulating p. notoginseng triterpene saponin biosynthesis. greater understanding of these regulatory mechanisms could facilitate mirna-based biotechnology for manipulating saponin production in both in vitro and in vivo systems.
