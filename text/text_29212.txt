BACKGROUND
rice , as the most important cereal crop, is a staple food for more than half the world’s population, especially in developing countries. because labor costs and water crises have increased in recent years, there is a growing demand for low-input direct-seeded rice in many growing regions  <cit> . soil salinization is a serious problem worldwide and a key abiotic stress in agriculture  <cit> . salinity affects rice growth during all developmental stages from seed germination to reproduction  <cit> . with the development and spread of direct-seeding technology, which requires high levels of seedling establishment in rice paddy fields that are salinized to some degree, salt tolerance at the seed germination stage has become a major rice breeding goal in many asian countries. therefore, it is necessary to understand the genetic mechanisms of salt tolerance at the seed germination stage in rice.

salt tolerance is a quantitative genetic characteristic that is controlled by multiple genes in rice  <cit> . in recent decades, with the rapid development of molecular marker technology, a number of quantitative trait loci  for salt tolerance in rice have been identified using bi-parental linkage mapping of plants at different developmental growth stages, such as at the seedling and mature stages  <cit> . more than  <dig> qtls controlling salt-related traits including the na+/k+ ratio and survival time have been reported for rice  <cit> . salt tolerance at the germination stage is not significantly correlated with salt tolerance at other stages  <cit> . to date, few studies have focused on evaluating the salt tolerance of rice at the germination stage to identify qtls related to salt tolerance at this stage  <cit> . a previous study detected only  <dig> qtls associated with seed germination traits under salt stress and control conditions in a recombinant inbred rice population  <cit> .

linkage analysis of qtls uses bi-parental genetic mapping populations. to date, most studies on qtls associated with salt tolerance have examined individual mapping populations  <cit> . however, this method is insufficient to reveal the genetic variation in salt tolerance among the rice germplasm. over the past several years, genome-wide association studies  using high-density genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms  detected by next-generation sequencing have provided a powerful strategy to detect variants that can be used directly to improve rice varieties . recently, the  <dig> rice genomes project   <cit>  used illumina next generation sequencing of a core collection of  <dig> rice accessions from  <dig> countries to generate sequence data with high coverage  and mapping rate  and to construct a high-density snp database  <cit>  providing genotype data for gwas of agronomic traits in rice. several gwass of salt tolerance in rice at the early tillering stage  <cit>  and reproductive stage  <cit>  have been reported. however, no studies have evaluated the diverse rice germplasm to identify potentially novel loci for salt tolerance at the seed germination stage.

in this study, therefore,  <dig> rice accessions with an appropriate growth period and without distinct unfavorable traits in southern china selected from  <dig> rice genomes sequenced by 3 k rgp  <cit> , were used to conduct an association analysis of salt tolerance at the germination stage. for this analysis, we used  <dig> , <dig> snps filtered from the 3 k rg  <dig> mio snp dataset in the rice snp-seek database  <cit> . the goal of this study was to understand the genetic basis and differentiation of salt tolerance at the germination stage in rice. this information will be useful for marker-assisted selection of direct-seeding rice varieties suitable for cultivation in salinized paddies.

RESULTS
seed germination of rice accessions under salt stress
the germination index , vigor index , germination rate , mean germination time , and imbibition rate  were determined for  <dig> rice accessions randomly selected from the whole panel under three salt treatments  . the gi, vi, and gr at  <dig> d  and gr at  <dig> d  significantly decreased as the nacl concentration increased, and mgt was significantly higher in the 100 mm nacl treatment than in the  <dig> and 80 mm nacl treatments. these findings suggested that the seed germination capability was positively correlated with gi, vi, gr-5d, and gr-10d, and negatively correlated with mgt. the ir values at 24 h  and 48 h  were not significantly different among the three nacl treatments. the seeds of  <dig> accessions germinated in the 60 mm nacl treatment, but the seeds of only  <dig> and  <dig> accessions germinated in the  <dig> and 100 mm nacl treatments, respectively . thus, the 60 mm nacl treatment was used in further experiments to compare germination traits among the  <dig> accessions .

the distributions of the values of seed germination-related traits under stress and control conditions, and the stress susceptibility index  to salt across the whole panel, are shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the ssi has been used to define the varieties or genotypes that show superior performance under stress and non-stress conditions in wheat  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . lower ssi values indicate higher tolerance to stress. all the traits showed a continuous distribution, and many accessions were susceptible to salt stress. the traits could be roughly classified into two categories; one with a symmetrical distribution and one with a skewed distribution. three traits  under salt stress, one trait  in the control, and one ssi trait  showed approximately symmetrical distributions. the other  <dig> traits  showed highly or moderately skewed distributions . compared with their respective values in the control, the average values of gi, vi, gr-5d, and gr-10d under salt stress were decreased by  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, while the mgt was increased by  <dig> % across the whole population. however, the ir values at 24 h and 48 h under salt-stress conditions were roughly the same as that in the control.

the results of a correlation analysis among the seven seed germination traits across the whole panel are shown in table  <dig>  there were significant positive correlations between vi and gr-related traits  , and the correlations were stronger  under salt-stress conditions. there were significant negative correlations between mgt and the other traits in the control, and the correlation coefficient values were lower under salt-stress conditions. there was a strong correlation between ir-24 h and ir-48 h, but not between ir  and the other germination-related traits in both the control and the salt treatment. the correlation analysis indicated that all traits, except for ir, exhibited a salt-stress response in this study. uncovering novel loci for these traits at the seed germination stage has great significance in rice breeding for salt tolerance.table  <dig> correlation coefficients of paired traits evaluated under control and salt-stress conditions

there was highly significant genetic variation in all seed germination traits among rice germplasm accessions nested within the rice subgroups, together with less significant variance in gi, ir-24 h, ir-48 h, and gr-48d within subgroups  under salt stress . there was no significant variance between replications for all seed germination traits . the box plots of ssi indicated a substantial level of genotypic variation in salt-stress responses among different accessions . an anova demonstrated that the ssi of vi and gr at  <dig> d were significantly lower in the subgroup japonica than in the subgroups indica and aus, and the ssi of mgt was significantly lower in the aus subgroup than in the indica and japonica subgroups . the average vi values for the japonica, indica, and aus subgroups were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, in the control, and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, under salt stress. this result suggested that the accessions in the japonica subgroup had higher salt tolerance than did the accessions in the other subgroups.table  <dig> anova  of seven seed germination-related traits in  <dig> rice accessions under salt stress

loci associated with salt tolerance at the germination stage identified by gwas
we randomly selected 20% of snps with minor allele frequency  >10% and missing rate < 20% for the linkage disequilibrium  decay analysis of each panel. the ld decayed quickly within ~8 kb for all panels, and decayed to its half-maximum within 95 kb for the whole panel, 52 kb for indica, and 230 kb for non-indica . we selected  <dig> , <dig> snps across the entire rice genome for the gwas of seed germination traits under salt-stress and control conditions, and the related ssi. the ld blocks in all gwas panels were defined by a fixed cutoff of < <dig>  for the ld statistic r
 <dig> on the same chromosome. multiple significant snps in a ld block were clustered as one association locus in each panel, and the snp with the minimum p value in a cluster was considered as the lead snp. after bonferroni multiple test correction,  <dig> loci  were identified as being associated with the ssis of the two seed germination traits  at a significance level of  <dig>   in the whole, indica, and non-indica panels . the quantile–quantile plots for the gwas results shown in fig.  <dig> indicate that the model was well fitted to the data. among the  <dig> loci,  <dig> were located in intervals containing previously mapped qtls or genes associated with tolerance to salinity or other abiotic stresses . additionally, for gi, vi, mgt, gr-5d, and gr-10d in the control,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> significant snps were detected in the whole, indica, and non-indica panels, respectively. this result indicated that there is wide genetic variation in seed germination-related traits in the rice germplasm . here, we focused on the significant associations of the ssis of vi and mgt, the two parameters that underlie salt tolerance at the germination stage in rice.table  <dig> summary of loci significantly associated with stress susceptibility indices of seed germination-related traits

for the ssi of mgt, five significant associated loci were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the whole, indica, and non-indica panels. these loci explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in the whole panel. four loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were close to qtls/genes identified previously as being related to tolerance to salinity or other abiotic stresses . the genome-wide peak locus, which contained the lead snp chr1_ <dig> , <dig>  in the whole panel, was identified in a ~  <dig>  kb interval  on chromosome  <dig>  this locus included two associated snps located in the intergenic region of loc_os01g <dig>  and loc_os01g <dig>  and one associated snp in the coding sequence-missense variant of loc_os01g <dig>  . the mgt of the minor genotype at the peak snp chr1_ <dig> , <dig>  aa , was significantly greater than that of the major genotype, gg . one significant locus on chromosome  <dig> containing snp chr4_ <dig> , <dig>  was detected only in the indica panel and was located in the intergenic region of loc_os04g <dig>  and loc_os04g <dig>  .

for the ssi of vi, six significantly associated loci were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the whole, indica, and non-indica panels. these loci explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in the whole panel. three loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were close to previously identified qtls related to tolerance to salinity or other abiotic stresses . the strongest association in the hot region was observed on chromosome  <dig> in a ~  <dig>  kb interval  that included three and four significant snps in the whole and non-indica panels, respectively . in this region, the lead snp in the gwas, chr2_ <dig>  , was identified in the intergenic region of loc_os02g <dig>  and loc_os02g <dig>  . the ssi for the vi of the major susceptible genotype at the lead snp , aa , was significantly greater than that of the minor resistant genotype, gg , in the non-indica population. the haplotypes of loc_os02g <dig>  were built based on  <dig> snps in the 2-kb upstream promoter region and 5′ untranslated region and synonymous snps in the coding region . in total, we detected nine haplotypes  shared by more than  <dig> of the  <dig> accessions. multiple comparison tests showed that accessions with hap <dig> had lower ssis of vi than did accessions with other haplotypes . the  <dig> accessions with the tolerant haplotype  of osnrt <dig>   are mainly from bangladesh and india and belong to the aus, basmati, indica and intermediate subgroups, but not the japonica subgroup. however, we did not find a significant difference in the ssis of vis among the accessions with different haplotypes of loc_os02g <dig> , which also belongs to the nrt <dig> family and is close to osnrt <dig> .fig.  <dig> strong association on rice chromosome  <dig> between stress susceptibility index and seed vigor index , and haplotype analysis of candidate gene loc_os02g <dig> 




another significant peak region with the lead snp chr9_ <dig> , <dig>  in the non-indica panel was located in the intron region of loc_os09g <dig>  which encodes a zinc ion-binding protein . the ssi of the vi of the major genotype at the lead snp , aa , was significantly greater than that of the major genotype, tt .

discussion
variations in the salt tolerance of rice at the germination stage
accurate phenotyping is the most important part of gwass on rice  <cit> . here, we measured seven seed germination-related traits  under salt stress and control conditions. these traits have been used successfully in previous studies for the qtl mapping of salt tolerance at the rice germination stage  <cit> . the intensity of the salt treatment is an important factor in the effective evaluation of salt tolerance during rice germination. we compared seven seed germination-related traits for  <dig> randomly selected rice accessions under three different nacl concentrations   and found that 60 mm nacl was the appropriate treatment to detect sufficient levels of genetic variation among the  <dig> rice accessions used in this study. these accessions showed continuous segregation of seed germination-related trait distribution frequencies .

mondal and pramanik evaluated the response of  <dig> rice varieties to salt stress during seed germination, and found that japonica varieties had higher tolerance than indica varieties to high-salt conditions  <cit> . our results indicated that the ssis of vi and gr at 10d were significantly lower in the japonica subgroup than in the indica and aus subgroups , indicating that japonica varieties had higher tolerance to salt stress than did the other subgroups at the germination stage. different genetic and physiological mechanisms of salt tolerance exist in the diverse germplasm of rice, and salt tolerance mechanisms can vary among varieties even within a particular subgroup  <cit> . it is generally thought that higher uptake of k+ in indica varieties results their higher tolerance to salinity than japonica rice at the seedling stage  <cit> . however, the mechanism underlying salt tolerance at the seed germination stage in rice is still obscure. because seed germination is a complex trait  <cit> , and, like salt tolerance, governed by multiple genes  <cit> , it is difficult to improve seed germination under salt stress. thus, to improve salt tolerance at the germination stage in rice, breeders should pyramid the tolerant snp genotype at the loci associated with salt tolerance using the potentially tolerant varieties identified in this study. for successful, knowledge-based crop improvement, further studies should focus on understanding the correlation between salt tolerance at the seed germination stage and that at the seedling stage, and on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance at different growth stages in rice.

qtls and candidate genes associated with salt tolerance of rice at the germination stage
linkage mapping using a bi-parental population benefits from high statistical power resulting from many individuals sharing the identical genotype at a given locus, but it has low resolution because of the limited number of recombination events. in contrast, association mapping has higher resolution because of the long recombination histories of natural populations, but has lower statistical power because most genotypes occur in only a few individuals  <cit> . the distance of ld is an important factor in determining the efficiency of gwas  <cit> . in this study, more rapid ld decay was observed in the indica subgroup than in the non-indica subgroup comprising mainly japonica and aus . this is consistent with the ld patterns reported for different subpopulations in rice  <cit> , suggesting that there has been a stronger bottleneck in japonica than in indica during domestication. the extent of ld decay detected in indica in this study  was smaller than that detected in another set of indica germplasm in another study   <cit> , partly because of the larger number of snps, which provides high resolution for gwas.

to date, more than  <dig> qtls related to salt tolerance in rice have been mapped using bi-parental linkage mapping populations  <cit> , but this is the first study to use association mapping to detect potentially novel qtls for salt tolerance at the seed germination stage. we identified  <dig> loci associated with salt tolerance at the germination stage in rice using a conservative threshold based on a bonferroni-adjusted p value  to reduce false positives. we compared the loci identified in this study with previously reported qtls related to salinity or other stresses in the qtl annotation rice online  database  <cit> . this comparison showed that seven loci on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were co-located with six previously detected qtls related to tolerance to salinity or other abiotic stresses in rice . for example, koyama et al.  <cit>  reported an initial area, from markers rm <dig> to r <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  which was associated with qtls controlling the na+: k+ ratio, total na+ uptake, and total k+ concentration. two regions significantly associated with the ssi of mgt on chromosome  <dig> were detected in this area in this study.

our results demonstrate that the gene osnrt <dig>  , encoding a nitrate transporter, is a candidate gene in the hot region for the ssi of vi  in different gwas panels. in rice, osnar <dig>  interacts with osnrt <dig>  and plays a key role in enabling plants to cope with a variable nitrate supply  <cit> . salt stress affects the expression level of the osnrt gene family, which might contribute to the accumulation of no3
− in the leaves of salt-stressed rice  <cit> . from the haplotype analysis, we found that osnrt <dig>   was associated with subpopulation differentiation . the minor/rare tolerant haplotype  of osnrt <dig>   could be useful in further studies and in breeding for salt tolerance at the rice germination stage.

CONCLUSIONS
we conducted genome-wide association mapping for salt tolerance at the germination stage based on high-density snps using  <dig> rice accessions. we identified  <dig> loci using the ssis of germination-related traits, which co-located with six previously detected rice qtls related to tolerance to salinity or other abiotic stresses. the minor/rare salt-tolerant haplotype of osnrt <dig>   was detected in a haplotype analysis. this gene is a candidate for the associated hot region on rice chromosome  <dig>  our study provides new insights into the genetic basis of salt tolerance in rice. identification of varieties with high salt tolerance at the germination stage, as well as knowledge of the associated snps and haplotype, could be useful for rice production and for improvement of direct-seeding varieties.
