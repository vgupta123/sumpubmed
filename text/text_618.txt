BACKGROUND
“tail-anchored  proteins” is a collective term for transmembrane proteins with a c-terminal transmembrane domain  and without an n-terminal signal sequence. they account for approximately 3– <dig> % of all transmembrane proteins that are involved in a wide range of processes such as membrane fusion, regulation of apoptosis, and vesicular transport  <cit> . because ta proteins lack n-terminal signal sequences, they are not recognized by the ribosomal signal recognition particle . after translation, they are bound by an atpase  at their tmd  <cit> . after binding to atp, trc <dig> and get <dig> form a so-called “closed” structure, and the resulting hydrophobic groove recognizes the tmd of ta proteins .

the research on ta proteins started with synaptobrevin, a soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor  attachment protein receptor . certain membrane proteins with a single tmd near the c-terminus are not recognized by srp, because their tmd remains within the ribosome when translation terminates  <cit> . kutay et al. found that synaptobrevin does not interact with srp or sec <dig> during its translocation to the membrane  <cit> . examples of ta proteins include snare proteins involved in membrane fusion, bcl-family proteins that regulate apoptosis, and the electron transport chain component cytochrome b <dig> 

although the mechanism of translocation of ta proteins is gradually being unraveled, more research is required along with new tools that can predict a ta protein from its amino acid sequence. however, public-domain ta-protein prediction tools are not available. furthermore, it is difficult to predict ta proteins according to amino acid sequence similarities, because they belong to different families that share only their c-terminal tmds.

numerous methods for identifying transmembrane proteins were either proposed or are available as web-based tools, and many are very accurate . however, no publicly available prediction tool can distinguish ta proteins from other types of membrane proteins. the conventional computational method to predict ta proteins analyzes and integrates the results obtained from multiple tools  <cit> . such procedures specifically require tmd prediction tools such as tmhmm and signal sequence prediction tools such as signalp and targetp . to partially circumvent such cumbersome procedures and to improve prediction accuracy, a dedicated prediction tool capable of distinguishing ta proteins from other membrane proteins is expected to be highly useful. to address this issue, we developed a machine-learning based technique to predict ta proteins from only target amino acid sequences, which employs hidden markov models . the high-speed prediction capabilities of this tool can be used to analyze an entire genome.

RESULTS
likelihood score predictions
the results of likelihood score-based predictions are shown in table  <dig>  for predictions with the signal peptide  and ta datasets, the scores were calculated from the likelihood values of the ta and sp models. for predictions with the membrane protein  dataset, the nonmembrane protein  set, all negative data, and the ta dataset, scores were calculated from likelihood values of the ta and mp models. we chose values of the threshold scores that minimized the balanced error rate  .
each row corresponds to the specified individual negative data. the “total” at the bottom of the table shows the cross-validation results for all negative data. tp, fp, fn, and tn represent true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative values, respectively



the discriminatory powers of the sp and ta datasets were indicated by sensitivity and specificity values of approximately  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and those of the mp and ta datasets were approximately  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. thus, the latter achieved the best performance among the three groups. the sensitivity and specificity of the no set were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

to discriminate between the all negative and ta datasets, sensitivity was  <dig>  . because of this reduced ability to discriminate between the datasets, the number of sequences that were correctly recognized as ta proteins decreased by  <dig>  in contrast, specificity was approximately  <dig> , which was higher than that of any other example of individual discrimination. the number of false positives was  <dig>  which was fewer than that of individual discrimination using the no set.

receiver operating characteristic  curves and likelihood distributions from discrimination using the sp, mp, no, and all-negative datasets are shown in fig.  <dig>  in all four cases, the distributions of the likelihood scores were not completely distinguishable between the positive and negative data. the distribution of the likelihood scores of the negative data peaked at a single value, whereas there were two or three peaks in the distribution of the ta sets.

although almost all likelihood scores in the ta set were > – <dig> , the scores were < – <dig>  for only one sequence . with this exception, the minimum likelihood scores of the ta set were − <dig>  in ssp  and − <dig>  in smp .

decoding-based predictions
the decoding-based prediction results are shown in table  <dig>  because the determination is based on the presence or absence of tmd and tail regions, this prediction method lacks a threshold. therefore, sensitivity and specificity were used as the evaluation indices.
each row corresponds to the specified individual negative data. the “total” at the bottom of the table shows the cross-validation results of all negative data. the area under the receiver operator curve  cannot be calculated because there are no indices  associated with this method



in the ta set, tmd and tail regions were correctly predicted for  <dig> proteins, although prediction attempts failed for  <dig> proteins. of the proteins that were not predicted, nine had no tmd region in the decoded sequence, and seven had a tail region comprising at least  <dig> residues and a tmd region. for the  <dig> sequences with successfully predicted tail regions, the lengths of the predicted tmd and tail regions are shown in fig.  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> distribution of predicted lengths of tail and tmd regions. a histogram of the predicted lengths of the tmd regions in sequences successfully predicted to have tmd and tail regions . b histogram of the predicted lengths of the tail regions in sequences successfully predicted to have tmd and tail regions 



because of the structural constraints of the ta model, the lengths of tmd regions were maintained between  <dig> and  <dig> residues. the most abundant sequences  were those with predicted lengths of  <dig> residues, followed by  <dig> sequences predicted with  <dig> residues and  <dig> sequences predicted with  <dig> residues. of the  <dig> successful predictions,  <dig> possessed tail regions comprising ≤ <dig> residues, accounting for  <dig>  % of the successfully predicted sequences and  <dig>  % of all ta-set sequences. in contrast,  <dig> sequences were predicted with tail regions ≥ <dig> residues. among the sequences with failed tail-region predictions but successful tmd-region predictions, the shortest tail region was  <dig> residues , and the longest was  <dig> residues.

predictions using both likelihood score and decoding
the results of predictions combining the likelihood score-based method and the decoding-based method are shown in table  <dig>  only sequences judged as ta proteins by both methods were regarded as positive. because no threshold exists for this method , the evaluation was based on sensitivity and specificity.
each row corresponds to the specified individual negative data. the “total” at the bottom of the table shows cross-validation results of all negative data. the area under the receiver operator curve  cannot be calculated, because there are no indices  associated with this method



compared with predictions based only on likelihood scores or only decoding, sensitivity decreased while specificity increased using this method, because the results were the product of the predictions of both methods. although sensitivity ranged from approximately  <dig> % to a maximum of  <dig> %, specificity remained between approximately 94– <dig> %. this high specificity may prove useful in applying the method to genomes with all-negative data.

discussion
in the present study, we used likelihood score-based predictions to achieve auc values ≥ <dig>  for every dataset, indicating that hmms developed here successfully reflect the characteristics of ta proteins and membrane proteins with signal sequences. the mp dataset had the highest auc, likely because the topologies of its members, which possess multiple tmds, differ significantly from those of ta proteins. many proteins included in the no dataset were also expected to have structures different from those of ta proteins and they did not share common features except for signal sequences, and had no dedicated models. consequently, the auc value for the no set was slightly lower than that of the mp set. further, the sp set had the lowest auc. in this set,  <dig> sequences contained tmds within  <dig> residues of the c-terminus . with so many structurally similar sequences, discrimination from the ta set would be more difficult than that with the other two datasets.

in all methods, we identified  <dig> common cases of failed predictions . of the sequences with failed predictions, the sec20_yeast sequence encodes a snare protein, which is involved in transport in the golgi apparatus, and forms a complex with ufe <dig> and use <dig>  <cit> . this protein contains a tmd, but its end is situated  <dig> residues distal to the c-terminus. as described in the ‘methods’ section, the majority of ta tmd domains reside within  <dig> residues of the c-terminus; therefore, in the present model, a tmd  <dig> residue away from the c-terminus will not be detected and thereby failed to be predicted. the yd012_yeast sequence is another example of a failed prediction. although the function of this sequence is unknown, it localizes to the plasma membrane  <cit> . the sequence contains glutamine -rich regions, accounting for its low hydrophobicity and low likelihood score .

to further investigate the characteristics of unsuccessfully predicted sequences, we analyzed the lengths and hydrophobicity values of the sequences listed at least once in table s <dig>  the length of unsuccessfully predicted sequences ranged from < <dig> residues to approximately  <dig> residues . however, in the 200– <dig> residue sequence range that includes an abundance of ta proteins, only one sequence was not predicted . in contrast, the failure rate was relatively high for proteins with long sequences. thus,  <dig> of  <dig> ta proteins with ≥ <dig> residues were not predicted . likewise, of the  <dig> ta proteins < <dig> residues, eight were not predicted.

these results may be attributable to the baum–welch algorithm used for training hmms, which is a type of maximum likelihood estimation, and depends on the training data. therefore, the models were highly compatible with more accurately annotated 200– <dig> residue sequences. however, because data is scarce for sequences of vastly different lengths, the characteristics of such sequences were likely not fully reflected during training. the hydrophobicity scores for many individual sequences of ta proteins were highest 10– <dig> residues upstream of the c-terminus, thereby creating highly hydrophobic regions near the c-terminus. nevertheless, in some sequences, hydrophobic regions were relatively distant from the c-terminus . moreover, because sec20_yeast and tlg2_yeast sequences possess tmds > <dig> residues upstream from the c-terminus, there were no hydrophobic regions in these plots. in such sequences, the likelihood decreased during decoding until a tmd was detected. therefore, predicting their correct topology may be more difficult than for sequences with hydrophobic domains in the proximity of the c-terminus.

for the genomes of humans, yeast, and thale cress, the conventional prediction method involves the combined use of existing prediction tools for tmds and signal sequences.

the conventional method employed the tools tmhmm  <cit>  to predict tmds and signalp  <cit>  to predict signal sequences. we applied this method to the ta set to determine its differences with our method named tailed-anchored protein prediction method, tappm .


the tmhmm/signalp and the tappm methods failed to predict  <dig> and  <dig> ta proteins, respectively. the prediction rate of signalp was  <dig> %. to construct the ta dataset, we used annotations from the uniprot/swissprot database that assigns signal sequence annotations according to signalp. therefore, our datasets contained only sequences that were successfully predicted using signalp. although we did not necessarily consider this while compiling our datasets, the tmd annotations were partially based on tmhmm. because datasets contained pre-existing findings derived from the conventional method, this may impart a slight advantage over our method for accurate predictions. although our method failed to predict more sequences than the conventional method, some successful predictions included those missed by the conventional method. in particular, ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein  <dig>  is an empirically confirmed ta protein, and uniprot/swissprot assumes it has two tmds  <cit> . therefore, we believe that the significance of our method lies in its ability to predict sequences that are not predicted by the conventional method and for sequences in databases with annotation errors.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we developed a prediction system, tappm, to identify ta proteins from amino acid sequences using hmms, which provides highly accurate predictions. by taking advantage of the properties of hmms, we devised two evaluation methods with varying characteristics. further, we collected data from empirically confirmed ta proteins to include in the training data. despite reduced accuracy to a certain extent compared with that of the conventional method, our method predicted the sequences of a few ta proteins that were not predicted using the conventional method. another advantage of our method is that it avoids the cumbersome procedures required to use the conventional methods.

we will aim to achieve even higher specificity, which is required for predicting genomic sequences that encode ta proteins. to achieve this goal, we will optimize hmms for ta proteins and construct sequence models for non-ta proteins. the identities of intracellular organelles harboring ta proteins are unknown as well as the motifs and mechanisms required for their transport. therefore, we believe that prediction of subcellular localization will contribute to identifying the transport mechanisms.
