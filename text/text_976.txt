BACKGROUND
there is a growing interest in examining the role epigenetic marks like histone modifications, non- coding rnas, and dna methylation may play as biological mechanisms through which environmental exposures and other physiological and lifestyle factors can lead to disease. unlike genetics, epigenetic modifications are dynamic and can change over time or in response to exposures. furthermore, host factors such as sex and age also contribute to inter-individual differences in epigenetic markers.

previous studies of dna methylation using the illumina 27 k beadchip methylation array have reported autosomal differentially methylated positions  or cpg sites with varying methylation between males and females, providing evidence that it will be important to adjust for sex in analysis of methylation data . however, these studies did not account for the existence of non-specific probes for autosomal cpgs that cross react with cpgs on sex chromosomes, thereby yielding false positives  <cit> . recently, mccarthy et al. published a meta-analysis of  <dig> studies all using the 27 k beadchip array to identify sex-associated autosomal dmps across specimens from multiple tissue types from adults and children  <cit> . after excluding the sex-biased cross-reactive probes, they identified  <dig> dmps that were associated with sex.

while mccarthy et al. identified several interesting autosomal dmps, their study focused on methylation assessed by the 27 k beadchip. in  <dig>  illumina released a new version of their methylation array, the 450 k beadchip, which greatly expanded the number of cpgs interrogated to over  <dig>  sites. further, their approach was restricted to identification of individual dmps rather than differentially methylated regions . dmr-finding approaches have several advantages over considering cpg sites individually, including decreased likelihood of hits from technical artifacts and possibly improved functional impact of results.

as methylation is cell-type specific and immune cell profiles have been shown to vary between sexes, consideration of cell composition is of utmost importance in methylation studies  <cit> . yet previous studies of sex-associated differences in methylation  haven’t taken this into account in their analyses. white blood cell composition can be estimated from 450 k beadchip data computationally in adults  <cit> , but these estimates are not appropriate for use for young children in their current implementation  <cit> . as an alternative, differential cell count  can be employed to effectively determine such cell type proportions  in cord blood samples.

here, we use the 450 k beadchip to assess sex differences in dna methylation from umbilical cord blood from boys and girls participating in a large epidemiologic cohort followed by the center for the health assessment of mothers and children of salinas  study. we use dccs to account for white blood cell composition. in addition to interrogating dmps, we apply the newly released ‘dmrcate’ methodology  <cit>  to identify sex-associated dmrs in newborns.

methods
study population
the chamacos study is a longitudinal birth cohort study of the effects of exposure to pesticides and environmental chemicals on the health and development of mexican-american children living in the agricultural region of salinas valley, ca. detailed description of the chamacos cohort has previously been published  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> pregnant women were enrolled in 1999– <dig> at community clinics and  <dig> liveborn singletons were born. follow up visits occurred at regular intervals throughout childhood. for this analysis, we include the subset of subjects that had both 450 k beadchip data and differential cell count analysis available at birth . mothers retained in the study subset had a mean age of  <dig>  years  at time of delivery. study protocols were approved by the university of california, berkeley committee for protection of human subjects. written informed consent was obtained from all mothers.

blood collection and processing
cord blood was collected and stored in both heparin coated bd vacutainers  and vacutainers without anticoagulant at the same time. blood clots from anticoagulant-free vacutainers were stored at −80 °c and used for isolation of dna for dna methylation analysis. heparinized cord blood was used to prepare whole blood slides using the push-wedge blood smearing technique  <cit>  and stored at −20 °c until staining for differential white blood cell count.

dna preparation
dna isolation was performed using qiaamp dna blood maxi kits  according to manufacturer’s protocol with small, previously described modifications  <cit> . following isolation, all samples were checked for dna quality and quantity by nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer . those with good quality  were normalized to a concentration of 50 ng/ul.

450 k beadchip dna methylation analysis
dna samples were bisulfite converted using zymo bisulfite conversion kits , whole genome amplified, enzymatically fragmented, purified, and applied to illumina infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchips  according to manufacturer protocol. locations of samples from boys and girls were randomly assigned across assay wells, chips and plates to prevent any batch bias. 450 k beadchips were handled by robotics and analyzed using the illumina hi-scan system. dna methylation was measured at  <dig>  cpg sites.

probe signal intensities were extracted by illumina genomestudio software  methylation module and back subtracted. systematic qa/qc was performed, including assessment of assay repeatability, batch effects using  <dig> technical replicates, and data quality established as previously described  <cit> . samples were retained only if 95 % of sites assayed had detection p >  <dig> . color channel bias, batch effects and difference in infinium chemistry were minimized by application of all sample mean normalization  algorithm  <cit> , followed by beta mixture quantile  normalization  <cit> . sites with annotated probe snps and with common snps  within 50 bp of the target identified in the mxl  hapmap population were excluded from analysis . probes where 95 % of samples had detection p >  <dig>  were also dropped . since our analysis was focused on cpg sites associated with sex, we excluded sites on the y chromosome  and x-chromosome cross-reactive probes  identified by chen and colleagues  <cit> . remaining cpgs included  <dig>  sites for analysis of sex. methylation values at all sites were logit transformed to the m-value scale to better comply with modeling assumption  <cit> .

differential cell counts
whole blood smear slides were stained utilizing a diffquik® staining kit, a modern commercial variant of the romanovsky stain, a histological stain used to differentiate cells on a variety of smears and aspirates. this staining highlights cytoplasmic details and neurosecretory granules, which are utilized to characterize the differential white blood count. the staining kit is composed of a fixative , eosinophilic dye , basophilic dye  and wash . for consistency and to ensure the best results the slides were all fixed for 15 min at 23 °c , stained in both the basophilic dye and eosinophilic dye for 5 s each and washed after each staining period to prevent the corruption of the dye.

slides were scored for white blood cell type composition by zeiss axioplan light microscope with 100× oil immersion lens. scoring was conducted at the perceived highest density of white blood cells using the standard battlement track scan method, which covers the entire width of a slide examination area. counts for each of the five identifiable cell types  were recorded by a dedicated mechanical counter. at least  <dig> cells were scored for each slide following validation of reproducibility by the repeated scoring of  <dig> sets of  <dig> cells from the same slide .

dmp analysis
association between sex at birth and differential 450 k dna methylation at individual cpgs was performed by linear regression, adjusting for dcc variables and analysis batch. this analysis was performed using r statistical computing software   <cit> . although dcc estimates were not significantly associated with sex, we chose to include them in the model because likelihood ratio tests showed that including them improved model fit for more than  <dig> of the cpg sites assessed by 450 k beadchip. we also examined gestational age and subject birthweight as possible covariates since both have been shown to be associated with dna methylation  <cit> , and performed sensitivity analysis to assess their potential impact. however, neither was associated with child sex or contributed to improved model fit.

p-values were corrected for multiple testing using a benjamini-hochberg  fdr threshold of  <dig>   <cit> .

enrichment of annotated genomic features
comparison of sex-dmp results to annotated function categories, including relation to genes and cpg islands , was performed using ucsc genome browser annotations supplied by illumina. a χ <dig> test of independence with 1° of freedom was used to determine whether there was evidence of enrichment among dmp results .

dmr analysis
identification of sex-associated dmrs was performed using the method described by peters et al.  <cit>  and implemented in the dmrcate bioconductor r-package  <cit> . the approach begins by fitting a standard limma linear model to all cpg sites in parallel  <cit> . this model was parameterized identically to the dmp analysis with sex as the binary predictor of interest, adjusting for dcc variables and analysis batch. the cpg site test statistics were then smoothed by chromosome according to the dmrcate defaults, which employs a gaussian kernel smoother with bandwidth λ =  <dig> base pairs  and scaling factor c =  <dig>  the resulting kernel-weighted local model fit statistics were compared to modeled values using the method of satterthwaite  <cit>  to produce p-values that are adjusted for multiple testing using a bh fdr threshold of  <dig>   <cit> . regions or dmrs were assigned by grouping fdr significant sites that are a maximum of λ bp from one another and contain at least two or more cpgs. under this method, cpgs are collapsed into dmrs without considering the direction of the association with the predictor . the minimum bh-adjusted p-value within a given dmr is taken as representative of the statistical inference for that region and the maximum fold change in methylation values  summarizes the effect size.

gene ontology analysis
gene ontology term enrichment analysis was performed by david  <cit> , webgestalt   <cit> , and consensuspathdb  <cit> , using hypergeometric distribution to assess enrichment significance. visualization of results and go term categorization by semantic similarity dimension reduction was performed by revigo  <cit> .

RESULTS
sex-associated differentially methylated positions in newborns
analysis of dna methylation differences between newborn boys and girls was performed by linear regression for 450 k beadchip cpgs among subjects with dcc measurements , adjusting for cell composition and batch . after data cleaning, n =  <dig>  cpgs were analyzed, which excluded sites previously reported to exhibit sex-chromosome specific cross-reactivity  <cit> . resulting p-values were plotted by chromosome, with sites having higher methylation levels in girls compared to boys plotted above the x-axis and those with lower levels plotted below . after adjustment for multiple testing , we identified  <dig>  cpgs that differed significantly by sex in newborns . of those hits, the majority of sites had higher methylation in girls compared to boys . this trend was consistent on both the x chromosome  and in autosomes . while the majority of hits were found on the x chromosome , a substantial number were also identified on autosomes .table  <dig> demographic characteristics of newborn chamacos subjects, n = 111

as differential hypermethylation is to be expected for girls due to x-inactivation , we focused characterization of results on autosomal sites showing sex differences . most of these were located in cpg shores, islands and open sea  . in comparison, shelf regions had the lowest percentage of hits . to assess whether the overrepresentation of hits in cpg islands and shores was due to the design of the 450 k beadchip, we compared the number of hits in each functional category with the number of cpg sites included in the assay. both shores and cpg islands were significantly overrepresented among all autosomal hits compared to the 450 k background , while shelves and the open sea hits were underrepresented . for cpg sites that were hypermethylated in girls compared to boys, we also observed overrepresentation in cpg islands and shores, and underrepresentation in shelf and open-sea locations . sites that were hypomethylated in girls compared to boys were underrepresented in the open sea  and shelves . hypomethylated sites were enriched at islands , but did not deviate significantly from the 450 k representation of shores .table  <dig> results for the top  <dig> gene-annotated autosomal dmps associated with sex in chamacos newborns

the  <dig>  cpg hits differentially methylated between newborn boys and girls were found in  <dig> unique genes, and  <dig>  of these genes were located on autosomes. many genes contained multiple significant sites, with an average of  <dig>  cpgs per gene and a maximum of  <dig> cpgs. however, the largest portion of sex-associated autosomal hits  was located in intergenic regions and seen at lower than expected frequency in gene bodies . near gene transcription starting points , all categories were either lower than 450 k cpg design frequencies or did not deviate from them significantly. further upstream , hits that were hypermethylated in girls were significantly enriched  while those showing decreased methylation were underepresented . at the end of genes , hits that had higher methylation for girls were underrepresented , while hits having higher methylation for boys did not deviate from expected 450 k frequencies .

examining the autosomal genes containing sex-associated dmps for enrichment of particular gene ontology  terms identified  <dig> pathways that were significantly enriched  . these enriched go terms fell into several broad categories including: 1) nervous system development, 2) behavior, 3) cellular development processes, and 4) cellular signaling and motility .table  <dig> the top  <dig> differentially enriched gene ontology pathways among hits for sex in autosomal cpgs



sex-associated differentially methylated regions in newborns
additionally, identification of groups of cpgs with 450 k beadchip methylation differences between newborn boys and girls was performed using the dmr-finding algorithm dmrcate  <cit> . this approach identifies and ranks dmrs by gaussian kernel smoothing of results from linear models for individual cpgs that were adjusted for cell composition and array batch . a total of  <dig> dmrs were significantly associated with sex in newborns after correcting for multiple testing . these spanned  <dig> genes and contained a total of  <dig>  unique cpgs. the number of sites within the dmrs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> cpgs, with 50 % of dmrs containing  <dig> or more cpgs and 25 % having  <dig> or more. further, dmr length averaged  <dig>  bp, and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb. figure  <dig> shows the dna methylation levels for boys and girls at two example top dmrs. figure 3a shows  <dig> cpg sites in a dmr that had higher methylation for girls in a region spanning the ppp1r3g transcription factor on chromosome  <dig>  while fig. 3b shows a  <dig> cpgs from a dmr with lower methylation among girls in the promoter of piwil <dig>  which is an important gene for stem cell proliferation and inhibition of transposon migration  <cit> .table  <dig> results for the top  <dig> gene-annotated autosomal dmrs associated with sex in chamacos newborns

as with dmps, the majority of sex-associated dmrs had higher methylation in girls compared to boys . this was true for both autosomes and sex chromosomes when considered individually, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of dmrs having higher methylation in girls, respectively. however, a greater total number of dmrs identified were located on autosomes  compared to the x chromosome. similarly, the  <dig>  % of the genes covered by sex-associated dmrs were located on autosomes. further, while the dmrcate method does not constrain all cpgs within a dmr to have the same direction of association with the predictor of interest, we found that the majority of dmrs had 100 % concordance across cpgs in the direction of effect with sex .

comparison of the individual site results  with the dmr findings revealed that of the  <dig>  cpg sites associated with sex in the dmp analysis,  <dig>   <dig>  were also included in a dmr. on autosomes, dmrs included  <dig>  % of sites found as sex-associated dmps. conversely, the dmrs added  <dig>  total sites  that had not been found by dmp analysis alone.

discussion
here, we assessed methylation sex differences in newborns as determined by 450 k beadchip. using reliable dcc estimates, our results are the first reported ewas analysis by sex at birth that adjusted for confounding by cell composition. to our knowledge, we are also the first study to assess regions of differential methylation associated with sex in addition to considering all cpg sites individually. we identified a large numbers of x-chromosome cpg sites with higher methylation in girls, which is most likely attributable to x-inactivation  <cit> . interestingly, we further demonstrated that a substantial number of autosomal sites and regions also appear hypermethylated in females .

to assess the consistency of our findings with those of prior analyses, autosomal cpg sites identified as differentially methylated by sex in the current analysis were compared to hits from the three most similar published studies to date   <cit> . these studies differed from ours either in dna methylation analysis platform  or in tissue type used . although the meta-analysis performed by mccarthy et al. included some studies in umbilical cord blood, most of the studies were performed in adult tissues. each study found between  <dig> and  <dig> autosomal cpg sites that were differentially methylated in association with sex . our results replicated  <dig>  of all hits, and  <dig> – <dig>  % by different studies. further, among replicated sites we observed  <dig> –100 % concordance in the direction of methylation differences. while there was substantial overlap between our autosomal sex-associated hits and these previously published results,  <dig> or  <dig>  % of our results are novel findings, some of which may be specific to the time point and tissue assessed . our larger number of hits is likely due to the increased coverage of the 450 k beadchip. in fact, when considered as a percentage of the number of sites analyzed, we observed a comparable portion of autosomal hits to that found by mccarthy and colleagues using the 27 k platform .table  <dig> comparison of chamacos autosomal sex-associated cpg sites  with other published studies



importantly, the autosomal methylation increases we observed were most concentrated in cpg islands and shores . as this trend was not evaluated in past studies, it should be explored and confirmed in additional datasets. further, our findings that neurodevelopmental ontology terms were strongly enriched among our autosomal findings suggests that dna methylation may contribute to differences in cognitive processes early in life. this is consistent with sex differences in brain development and rates of maturation that have previously been observed by magnetic resonance imaging in slightly older children   <cit>  and represent a possible regulatory mechanism requiring additional investigation.

our autosomal hits included several genes already known to exhibit sex-specific functions. these included the male fertility and spermatogenesis related genes identified by mccarthy and colleagues . one of our top hits showing increased methylation for girls  included slc6a <dig>  solute carrier family  <dig>  that is involved in presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine and has been implicated in several neurological disorders with sex-differences in prevalence . similarly, we observed novel sex differences in the shank <dig> and shank <dig> scaffolding protein genes that have been associated with autism spectrum disorders   <cit> . further, our hits included the homeobox containing transcription factor emx <dig>  empty spiracles homeobox <dig>  that is required for sexual differentiation and gonadal development  <cit>  and we found to be hypermethylated among girls .

the dmr analysis confirmed several trends observed by analyzing cpgs individually. in particular, dmr results again showed that girls tend to exhibit hypermethylation compared to boys. also, many cpgs found to be autosomal dmps were separately identified as being located within sex-associated dmrs. besides confirming many of the findings in the dmp analysis, the application of dmr-finding substantially expanded the number of cpg sites considered significant. these results demonstrate that considering methylation over regions rather than single cpg sites may be a more effective way to identify differentially methylated sites and genes of interest.

CONCLUSIONS
we confirmed and expanded previously identified trends in autosomal and x-chromosome methylation sex differences during a previously unstudied window in child development, immediately after birth, likely critical in establishing long term health. this strategy to assess epigenetic perturbation as near as possible to the prenatal period remains a high priority in light of the fetal origins of human disease hypothesis .
