BACKGROUND
copy number variations , a form of genomic structural variation, are defined as duplications or deletions of dna fragments that range in size from at least  <dig> base-pairs  to more than several megabase-pairs , causing a different copy number of specific genomic regions among individuals of a species . cnv represents an important source of genetic variation complementary to snp data, but which affects a higher percentage of genomic sequences and has potentially stronger effects on phenotypic diversity and evolutionary adaptation, through changing gene dosage and transcript structure, and regulating gene expression and function  <cit> .

as a common feature of vertebrate genomes, the foundational studies of cnv have been conducted in humans. around  <dig> , <dig> cnvs that correspond to over  <dig>  cnv regions have been identified in humans and these may account for > <dig>  % of the human genome, with over 12 % of gene sequences involved in cnv regions  <cit> . cnvs that underlie complex traits such as obesity, diabetes, alzheimer’s disease and autism spectrum disorders have been detected in human patients  <cit> . in recent years, advances in genomic technologies have made it increasingly feasible to screen comprehensively for cnvs, and so interest in cnv detection has extended to livestock species, with considerable advances being made . cnv maps have been constructed for cattle  <cit> , horse  <cit> , goat  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , pig  <cit> , dog  <cit>  and chicken  <cit> , providing a very valuable resource for evolution and genetic improvement research in livestock. in addition, there is growing evidence for cnvs associated with phenotypic variation, disease susceptibility, environmental adaptation and production traits in livestock species. for example, the copy number variation of the amy2b gene probably allowed dogs to thrive on a relatively starch-rich diet during their domestication  <cit> . the asip cnv allele is almost entirely associated with different coat colors in different goat breeds  <cit>  and in tibetan sheep  <cit> . the most recognizable chicken pea-comb phenotype is attributed to a duplication near the sox <dig> gene  <cit> . a cnv involving the akr1c gene is considered possibly responsible for testicular androgen synthesis and sexual development in horse  <cit> . the dna dosage and est expression of cnvs overlapping with the ntn <dig> gene may influence meat quality in pigs  <cit> . in bovid species, several important genes related to clear phenotypic changes and breed differences have been modified by cnvs: the copy number variations of the hsfy and znf280by genes are associated with male reproductive traits in holstein bulls  <cit> ; pla2g2d located in a cnv region is associated with aspects of body size in chinese bulls such as heart girth and hucklebone width  <cit> ; hereditary myopathy of diaphragmatic muscles in holstein-friesian cattle has been linked to deletion of the hspa1b gene  <cit> ; and the apol <dig> gene involved in lipid transport is highly duplicated in beef breeds  <cit> . these studies reveal that many beneficial cnvs may have been artificially selected in livestock during domestication and could be associated with or affect important traits of economic interest. however, only a few studies provide a comprehensive characterization of the evolutionary impact of cnvs comparing a wild and domestic population.

the yak  is the only major livestock that can survive the extremely cold, harsh and oxygen-poor conditions and take full advantage of the limited grassland resources on the qinghai-tibetan plateau   <cit> . yak were domesticated by the early nomadic people from wild yak more than  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . nowadays, there are more than  <dig> million domestic yaks, providing necessities for tibetans and other nomadic pastoralists in high-altitude environments; in addition, there are still 15– <dig> thousand wild yaks roaming the northwestern qtp  <cit> . it should be noted that the domestic yak is the only large animal that still coexists with its wild ancestors in a similar environment, as wild progenitors of other domestic livestock are now extinct or geographically dispersed  <cit> . therefore, the wild and domestic yak provide a good framework for studying effects of cnv in large livestock domestication  <cit> . indeed, a more comprehensive understanding of cnvs at the whole-genome level could provide additional evidence for unraveling the genetic basis of yak domestication. however, as far as we know, there is only one published dataset reporting only  <dig> cnv regions based on just two yak individuals using the cattle-specific nimblegen3x720k cgh array  <cit> .

although comparative genomic hybridization  and snp arrays are routinely used for cnv identification, the performance of these methods are heavily depending on the marker density and the specially designed non-polymorphic probes . the advent of next-generation sequencing  technologies and complementary analysis has provided innovative approaches to systematically screen cnvs at a whole-genome level, especially in non-model organisms  <cit> . among different analysis programs to detect cnvs using sequence data, the read depth  method have become a major approach due to its stronger ability to estimate the exact copy numbers and identify cnvs in complex genomic regions  <cit> . thus, the recent completion of the yak genome and population genome studies now allow for a comprehensive screening of cnv  <cit> .

here we describe the first genome-wide and systematic analysis of cnvs in yak using ngs genome re-sequencing data from wild and domestic yak. this cnv map was constructed for three main reasons. first, to develop and enrich new genomic variations in order to facilitate further research on yak and other bovid species and make it available to the scientific community. second, to determine genes affected by cnv that differ between wild and domestic yak, and evaluate whether extensive cnv is related to domestication. third, to compare the cnvs in individuals from different altitudes and assess the evolutionary impact of cnvs in adaptations to life at high altitude.

RESULTS
cnv discovery and data set statistics
we used whole genome re-sequenced data from our previous study, based on  <dig> wild and  <dig> domestic yaks from widely spaced locations across the qtp , representing three highly diverged mitochondrial lineages and broad genetic diversity  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  tb of sequences with an average depth of  <dig> × were used   <cit> . mapping these reads to the yak reference genome  <cit>  revealed that at least 93 % of the genome was covered by reads from a single individual, and, on average, 98 % of the reference genome was covered, indicating that the data are sufficient and of high enough quality for cnv detection  <cit> .fig.  <dig> geographical distribution of the yak samples used in this study. the sampling locations and altitudes for wild  and domestic  yak were mapped using arcgis software. geographic  and altitude  parameters were obtained from freely accessible data layers



using the cnvnator software based on the rd method  <cit> , we detected a total of  <dig>  cnv events from the  <dig> individuals . the average number of cnvs per individual was  <dig>   with an average of  <dig> gain and  <dig> loss events. the size of the cnvs identified varied from  <dig>  kb to  <dig> .0 kb with an average size of  <dig>  kb and a median size of  <dig>  kb. specifically, only  <dig>  % of all cnv calls were present in a single individual . the results of cnvs identified and the location information for each individual are listed in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> cnv size interval distribution. average cnv size is  <dig>  kb and the median size is  <dig>  kb



we further defined  <dig>  regions with copy number variations  by merging all overlapping calls across multiple individuals into unique regions and filtering the ones that were present in fewer than four individuals. these cnvrs occupied a total of 153 mb or  <dig>  % of the yak genome, substantially more than the recent study in two yak individuals based on a cgh array approach   <cit> . the length of the cnvrs varied from 3 kb to  <dig>  kb with an average of 58 kb. among all cnvrs,  <dig>  were found to be common to all  <dig> individuals . according to the type of cnvrs, they were divided into three categories, including  <dig> gain,  <dig>  loss and  <dig> both  events . although it is difficult to compare the cnvrs in different studies due to the different diversity of individuals and the technology used for detection, our study based on next-generation sequencing, using  <dig> different wild as well as domestic yaks resulted in better resolution and higher confidence in calling cnvrs than past research  <cit> . thus, most of the cnvrs discovered in this study are novel compared to previous studies and they represent the largest catalog of yak specific cnvrs to date.fig.  <dig> genomic landscape of yak copy number variation regions and segmental duplications. the sds are plotted as blue bars. the cnvrs are illustrated above the sds in green , orange  and purple . the chromosome numbers  are shown nearby correspond cnv landscape, and the bar height represents different sample numbers 



we evaluated the accuracy of individual copy number variations predicted by performing a series of real time-polymerase chain reactions . the experimental validation showed that 88 % of the cnvs  had an accurate copy number and 100 % were in agreement with the predicted patterns . it should be emphasized that not all true cnvs could be detected by qpcr, especially some low-copy duplications with lower sequence similarities. thus, a 12 % false positive rate is a conservative estimate in our cnv analysis, representing a relatively low false positive rate in our cnv calling and cnvr definitions  <cit> . we further estimated the accuracy using  <dig> deep-coverage  yak genomes, including three domestic and three wild individuals, revealing that 85 % of our original cnv calls were supported by higher coverage genome data. moreover, considering that the quality of the assembled reference as well as the annotated repeats is crucial to discovering cnvs using the rd method, additional experimental validation, such as qpcr from more individuals, array comparative genomic hybridization  and fluorescent in situ hybridization , will be required to obtain more accurate information about the cnvs and to exclude false positives  <cit> .

sd detection and comparison with cnvrs
segmental duplications  were shown to be one of the catalysts and hotspots for cnv formation in many species  <cit> , and we tested whether the non-random association between cnvs and sds was preserved in yak. based on whole-genome assembly comparison   <cit>  and whole-genome shotgun sequence detection   <cit>  methods, we first identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  putative segment duplication events, respectively. by merging these two data sets, we finally predicted  <dig>  segments, spanning  <dig>  mb of dna sequence and comprising  <dig>  % of the yak genome , a similar level to that of the bovine genome   <cit> . we subsequently compared the overlap between the sds identified above and the cnvrs and found that 56 % of large cnvrs  directly overlapped with sds. random simulations further confirmed significant relationships between 5 mb flanking regions of cnvrs and their overlap with sds , consistent with the previously studied cnvs that were enriched with sds  <cit> .

gene content of cnv regions
among the  <dig>  cnvrs described above,  <dig>  harbored a total of  <dig>  protein-coding genes according to the current yak genome . these represent a valuable resource for future studies on the relationship between cnv genes and phenotypic variation. gene ontology  enrichment analysis indicated that cnvrs harbored genes that were mainly involved in sensory perception and olfactory receptor activity , such as the go categories “olfactory receptor activity”, “sensory perception”, “sensory perception of chemical stimulus” and “sensory perception of smell”, which was consistent with the observation that olfactory gene families are large and associated with cnvs  <cit> . in addition, gene families involved in sensory perception are usually fast evolving due to their importance in the organism responding to rapid changes in the environment and they have been repeatedly detected in cnv regions of several livestock genomes. our previous comparative genome study also found that gene families related to sensory perception were substantially expanded in yak compared to other mammals  <cit> .

population-differentiated cnvrs between wild and domestic yak
to reveal the potential contributions of cnvs in the process of yak domestication, we carried out a comparative study to find the cnvrs with significantly different copy number between domestic and wild yak. we identified  <dig> cnvrs potentially selected during domestication, containing  <dig> annotated protein coding genes .

strong selection on reducing aggressive behavior and neurological traits is often involved in the initial step of animal domestication  <cit> , and our previous domestication selective sweep analysis based on snp data identified  <dig> genes related to these functions  <cit> . in this study, we found eight more genes with high cn differentiation between domestic and wild yak that are involved in neuronal development and are associated with behavior, further indicating that genes related to brain and nervous system development might underlie the processes that led to the successful domestication of the yak. for example, grin2d is related to normal brain development and associated with learning, working memory and behavioral attention  <cit> ; ftl encodes the ferritin protein and mutations in this gene could lead to behavioral abnormalities and cognitive impairment  <cit> ; ntn <dig> is highly expressed in neurogenic regions of the adult brain and controls neurogenesis  <cit> ; shank <dig> plays a role in synapse formation and dendritic spine maturation  <cit> ; kcnj <dig> has a function in controlling the excitability of motor neurons  <cit> ; ca <dig> is abundantly expressed in the brain and has a general role in the central nervous system  <cit> ; ntf <dig> encodes a neurotrophic factor which controls neuron differentiation  <cit> ; and arsa is related to many neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

another important consequence of livestock domestication is a change in their reproductive efficiency, such as age of puberty, sperm production, ovulation rate and embryonic mortality  <cit> . we found seven cnv-associated genes involved in reproductive performance traits. tseg <dig>  akr1c <dig> and izumo <dig> are sperm-specific expressed genes and have a role in spermatogenic cell development and fertility . lhb is expressed in the pituitary gland and promotes spermatogenesis and ovulation; mutations in this gene are associated with polycystic ovary syndrome in women  <cit> . spaca <dig> encoded protein is retained on the inner acrosomal membrane of spermatozoa and plays a role in sperm–egg binding and fertilization  <cit> . fgf <dig> encodes fibroblast growth factor protein, which is involved in embryonic development  <cit> . dmbt <dig> encoding lactoprotein as a scavenger receptor protein in milk, which can suppress various bacterial infections in vitro and plays an important role in the innate immunity of breast-fed infants  <cit> .

previous studies have revealed that domestication leads to relaxation of selective constraints in the yak mitochondrial genome, because the domestic yak and wild yak have different energy demands and metabolic efficiency  <cit> . we found four genes, nd4l  <cit> , sco <dig>  <cit> , co <dig>  <cit>  and nd <dig>  <cit> , related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation  that exhibit marked cn variation between wild and domestic yak, indicating that cnv may affect genes involved in energy metabolism during yak domestication.

the progress of domestication of livestock would also affect nutritional uptake, absorption and metabolism  <cit> . we found that seven interesting cnvrs harbored genes related to nutrition metabolism and there were significant differences in copy number between domestic and wild yak. for instance, mogat <dig>  <cit> , gys <dig>  <cit>  and dhdh  <cit>  are involved in the metabolism of sugars ; hsd17b <dig>  <cit>  and cpt1b  <cit>  are involved in lipid metabolism; bcat <dig> is involved in amino acid metabolism  <cit> ; and miox is involved in carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . in addition, we identified four genes  related to meat production and quality, which is also an economically significant trait that has been extensively considered during the artificial selection process.fig.  <dig> heatmap of cnvr with mogat <dig> gene located in scaffold3413_ <dig>  average read depths were plotted every 5 kb of the genome. the cnvr with the mogat <dig> gene represents different average normalized read depths of a specific region. the domestic yak  exhibited a lower copy number than the wild ones . cds and gene are shown at the bottom 



taken together, our results suggest that some cnvrs may have been under selection pressure during yak domestication and these are associated with behavior, physical characteristics and economically significant traits. consequently, additional functional experiments are needed to verify the contributions of the identified genes located in cnvrs to domestication.

population-differentiated cnvrs between yak living at high and low altitudes
in order to understand better the evolutionary impact of cnvs in adaptations to high altitude, we compared the cnvs between domestic yak living in high-altitude  and low-altitude  areas. we found  <dig> cnvrs that are significantly different between these two groups:  <dig> of them harbor  <dig> protein-coding genes . first, compared to the low-altitude population, yak living at high-altitudes must overcome the severe environmental challenges of hypoxia and an increased risk of high-altitude illness, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and emphysema. we identified three genes involved in the response to hypoxia – mrp <dig>  <cit> , dcc  <cit>  and dexi  <cit>  – for which the copy number differed between high and low-altitude domestic yak. the mrp <dig> gene encodes atp-binding cassette  transporters, regulating intracellular levels of camp and cgmp in arterial smooth muscle cells; inhibition of mrp <dig> expression can prevent and reverse hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension  <cit> . the dcc gene encodes the netrin  <dig> receptor, which plays an important mediating function in protecting against hypoxia-induced mitochondrial apoptosis  <cit> . dexi expression was increased in emphysema tissues and is associated with disease progression  <cit> . second, we found six cnv genes related to the immune system that may be involved in high altitude adaptation. ulbp <dig> encodes the immune system-activating receptor on t-cells and is related to pathogen- and parasite-resistance  <cit> . ciita is a positive regulator of class ii major histocompatibility and mutations in this gene are associated with diseases of the immune system  <cit> . cathl <dig> encodes cathelicidin, which is important in innate immune defense against bacterial infection   <cit> , bola-dqa <dig>  bola-dqa <dig> and bola-dqb are key leukocyte antigen genes associated with the immune response. these cnvrs that span potential genes influencing the immune system may reflect the substantially different diseases triggered by the parasites and arbovirus at high and low altitudes . these results suggest that cnv is an important type of genetic variation that may play a role in yak adaptation to high-altitude environments.fig.  <dig> heatmap of cnvr with cathl <dig> gene located in scaffold2990_ <dig>  average read depths were plotted every 3 kb of the genome. the cnvrs with the cathl <dig> gene represents different average normalized read depths of a specific region. the yaks living in low-altitude  exhibited a lower copy number than the ones living in high-altitude . cds and gene are shown at the bottom 



CONCLUSIONS
we performed genome-wide cnv detection based on whole genome sequencing data for  <dig> wild and  <dig> domestic yaks. a total of  <dig>  cnvrs comprising  <dig> megabases of the yak genome were identified; this represents the largest source of cnvs identified and the highest-resolution individualized cnv map constructed for the yak genome to date. the inferred cnvrs contain  <dig>  functionally annotated genes and further functional analyses reveal cnvrs enriched for genes related to sensory perception and responses to stimuli. comparing the different cnvs in wild and domestic yak suggests that many genes overlapping with cnvrs play a role in behavior, physical characteristics and economically significant traits. in addition, some novel genes, including dexi, dcc, and mrp <dig>  were found to be covered by cnvrs related to adaptation to high-altitude environments. our study represents a comprehensive genomic analysis of cnvs in yak and provides valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics of copy number variation, in the context of domestication and high-altitude adaptation. the database presented in this study will provide an important genetic resource for future work on phenotypic variation and breeding in both yak and other bovid species.
