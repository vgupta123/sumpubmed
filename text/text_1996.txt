BACKGROUND
the white mold fungus sclerotinia sclerotiorum  de bary is a cosmopolitan necrotrophic pathogen infecting over  <dig> plant species. it is among the most devastating pathogens of soybean, rapeseed and sunflower, causing several hundred million dollar losses annually at the pre- and postharvest stages  <cit> . s. sclerotiorum host range is remarkably broad, with fruit and vegetable productions also being severely impacted  <cit> . s. sclerotiorum and its close relative the grey mould fungus botrytis cinerea are among the few fungal pathogens considered as typical necrotrophs. as such, they derive energy to complete their life cycle mostly from dead plant cells, as opposed to biotrophs that feed on living plant cells.

there is now ample evidence that biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi secrete specialized effector proteins manipulating host cell physiology to obtain nutrients, suppress plant defense and ultimately promote infection  <cit> . effectors may also trigger plant defense responses, leading to plant resistance, when recognized directly or indirectly by the plant immune system in a gene-for-gene relationship. this results from a co-evolutionary arms race between pathogen effectors, their plant targets, and components of the plant immune system  <cit> . necrotrophs have long been considered as less adapted, secreting mostly degrading enzymes and toxins that unspecifically trigger programmed cell death  and dismantle plant cells.

however, host specific necrotrophs such as cochliobolus victoriae secrete effector proteins translocated into plant cells that interact with specific corresponding host proteins to facilitate disease progression  <cit> . this involves the activation of plant pcd instead of its suppression as in the case of infection by biotrophic pathogens. s. sclerotiorum also produces the non-proteic pathogenicity determinant oxalic acid. this molecule induces the synthesis of reactive oxygen species  and triggers plant pcd late during infection, but has the opposite effect, suppressing ros burst and pcd induction, at the early stages of infection  <cit> . the ssitl secreted integrin-like protein of s. sclerotiorum promotes virulence and delays the activation of plant defense responses, supporting the view that s. sclerotiorum secretes effectors to finely manipulate plant physiology  <cit> . in addition, enzymes secreted by necrotrophs can act as virulence factors independently of their catalytic activity  <cit> . effector repertoires vary considerably, notably according to pathogens lifestyle  <cit> , and it is becoming clear that interactions between necrotrophs and their host plants are considerably more complex and subtle than previously considered. what is the effector candidate repertoire associated with broad host range necrotrophy remains unclear. as a first step towards elucidating the molecular bases for colonization by s. sclerotiorum, its repertoire of effector candidates needs to be determined.

the recent release of genome sequences for a number of plant pathogenic fungi facilitated the search for effector candidates  at the genome level  <cit> . nevertheless, considering that pathogen effector repertoires are typically lineage-specific, the identification of effectors remains challenging  <cit> . the analysis of s. sclerotiorum genome sequence uncovered sets of genes associated with the manipulation of redox status, including enzymes of oa biosynthesis, the degradation of plant cell wall, and  <dig> secreted proteins with other functions  <cit> . known hallmarks of fungal effectors such as the presence of signal peptides and absence of transmembrane domains, small size and amino-acid composition generally produce lists of hundreds of potential effectors in a given pathogen. therefore, more sophisticated approaches are required to pinpoint the most relevant ecs for the promotion of infection in s. sclerotiorum secretome.

a limited number of known fungal effector families show conservation at the sequence level or similar predicted functions. this is notably the case for the toxin and cell death elicitor proteins of the necrosis and ethylene-inducing like proteins , the cerato-platanin, cyanovirin-n homology  and ecp <dig> families . the growing number of characterized fungal effectors suggests conservation at the biochemical function level in the overall effector repertoire of several fungal pathogens. the ability to bind chitin or other cell wall oligosaccharides, masking the presence of the pathogen or dampening damage-induced plant responses, is a feature common to effectors from multiple fungal pathogens . fungal effectors harboring a protease inhibitor activity are also common . the biochemical activity of a few other fungal effectors such as m. oryzae fungalysin metalloprotease avrpita  <cit> , u. maydis chorismate mutase cmu <dig>  <cit>  and peroxidase inhibitor pep <dig>  <cit>  may also be part of the arsenal of effector functions in multiple fungal lineages. this hypothesis suggests that thorough annotation of protein domains and prediction of biochemical function of secreted proteins may prove useful to identify novel effectors in s. sclerotiorum.

however, a majority of effectors do not show significant similarity to known sequences in other organisms nor obvious protein domains. yet other genomic characteristics may help identify ec genes. the rapid evolution of effector genes allows the fungi to overcome selection pressures induced by resistant plant cultivars. a high ratio of non-synonymous over synonymous substitutions  in alleles from related strains is a frequently used proxy for inferring fast gene evolution and the action of positive selection  <cit> . this approach has been used to reveal ecs in several filamentous plant pathogen lineages . positive selection has been detected in b. cinerea genome  <cit>  suggesting that it may be used to mine s. sclerotiorum genome for ecs. second, gene duplication is another hallmark of several known fungal effector genes, such as the toxb host specific toxin of pyrenophora tritici-repentis  <cit> . third, genomic regions with high repeat and transposable element content are enriched in effector genes in several lineages of plant pathogens  suggesting that genome architecture analysis can assist in the search for ec genes. finally, effectors can alter host cell function by mimicking plant peptides  <cit> . these ecs likely elude functional annotation on the basis of primary amino-acid sequence, but may be revealed using three-dimensional structure prediction.

as opposed to oomycete pathogen genomes in which many effector genes can be identified through conserved sequence motifs  <cit> , the use of conserved sequence motifs, such as the y/f/wxc motif  <cit> , has proven limited in revealing fungal effectors across lineages. however, the presence of a signal peptide directing protein secretion and gene expression in planta are relatively universal properties of effectors that can be exploited as first filters to narrow down the list of effector candidates in fungal genomes.

s. sclerotiorum effector proteins would be useful as probes to search for resistance components in plants and to design strategies for inhibiting infections by this devastating but poorly characterized pathogen. in this study, we report a diverse repertoire of s. sclerotiorum effector candidates revealed by an in depth analysis of its predicted secretome. we combined refined secretome annotation, phylogeny, selection and gene duplication analyses, and three-dimensional structure prediction to identify  <dig> ecs. among those, we highlight a predicted subtilisin inhibitor, a xylanase, a duplicated gene of unknown function and three toxin mimics as high priority candidates for functional studies. we analyzed in planta expression pattern for  <dig> ec genes and revealed host-blind and host-regulated ecs.

RESULTS
definition and annotation of s. sclerotiorum secretome
in the original analysis of s. sclerotiorum genome, secreted proteins were predicted using signalp, targetp and tmhmm, and annotated using interproscan  <cit> . to identify and explore candidate effectors in the genome of s. sclerotiorum, we built a bioinformatics workflow exploiting genomic features typical of known filamentous plant pathogen effectors. we first refined the prediction of secreted proteins combining predictions from signalp <dig> and  <dig> to identify  <dig> proteins with a secretion signal. to evaluate the sensitivity of this prediction, we applied the same methodology on a list of  <dig> eukaryotic secreted proteins validated experimentally from the spdb  <cit> . we retrieved  <dig> proteins predicted as secreted, corresponding to a true positive rate of  <dig> %. next, we removed  <dig> proteins predicted by tmhmm to harbor transmembrane helices, then  <dig> proteins predicted by gpisom to harbor glycophosphatidylinositol anchor motifs, that likely represent surface proteins rather than secreted effectors. this resulted in a list of  <dig> predicted secreted proteins. to increase the likelihood of identifying genes relevant for infection, we selected those for which there is evidence for expression in planta based on publicly available est and microarrays data. we considered genes expressed, even if not induced, during interaction with rapeseed, sunflower or tomato . although this filtering pipeline likely excluded relevant effector candidates, it resulted in a total of  <dig> genes encoding predicted secreted proteins expressed in planta .figure  <dig>

next, we performed three different effector-oriented analyses on the  <dig> spep genes. first, we used blast2go, pfam domain and nuclear localization signal  searches to annotate  <dig> speps . we built a database of known fungal effectors and explored the literature to select 31 s. sclerotiorum ecs among annotated spep genes. second, we defined clusters of orthologous genes  between s. sclerotiorum and b. cinerea predicted genes using inparanoid . a total of  <dig> spep genes grouped in cogs. we aligned s. sclerotiorum and b. cinerea orthologs for these  <dig> gene pairs and calculated ratios of non synonymous over synonymous substitutions  to identify five ecs with signature of positive selection. the  <dig> spep genes with no ortholog in b. cinerea were grouped into clusters based on sequence similarity to identify  <dig> ecs distributed in  <dig> families containing genes duplicated in s. sclerotiorum. finally, we analyzed the taxonomic distribution of spep genes across the kingdom fungi using blastp searches against a database of  <dig> complete genomes representative of all major fungal lineages. this identified 70 s. sclerotiorum-specific spep genes, most of which had no annotation . we used protein structure prediction and pattern and fold recognition searches to identify  <dig> ecs analogous to known protein fold encoded by s. sclerotiorum-specific spep genes.

using effector-oriented analyses, we identified four lists of ecs, containing a total of  <dig> ec genes . we could not predict any enzymatic activity encoded by 33% of the spep genes , suggesting that s. sclerotiorum effector repertoire encodes diverse functions that are not restricted to plant cell degrading enzymes. besides,  <dig> % of the spep genes  did not cluster in b. cinerea cogs, revealing a relatively high degree of divergence from this closely related fungal pathogen.

sclerotinia effector candidates showing conserved domains
some fungal effectors show conserved protein domains and biochemical functions that can be identified at the protein sequence level. in a first approach to identify ecs, we used  pfam annotations,  nuclear localization signal  predictions, and  blastp searches against known fungal effectors. we found  <dig> annotated spep genes among which we selected  <dig> as effector candidates based on the presence of specific pfam domains . indeed, six predicted speps  included chitin-recognition or chitin-binding domains  and one spep  contained lysm domains . ss1g_ <dig> was annotated as a concanavalin a-like lectin/glucanase that binds to complex carbohydrates, and harbors a peptidase a <dig>  with a typical lectin fold. ss1g_ <dig> contains a ricin type beta-trefoil lectin domain  typical of ricin-like toxins. these predicted speps are relevant ecs considering that chitin- and carbohydrate-binding activity has been reported for several fungal effector families. we also selected three predicted speps  with protease inhibitor domains , another activity found in known fungal effectors. we identified two predicted speps  with a cfem cystein-rich fungal effector motif . second, we selected another  <dig> spep genes based on the presence of at least one predicted nls in their sequence . the co-occurrence of a secretion signal and a nls in encoded proteins suggest that they may be active in the plant nucleus. consistent with a nuclear activity, ss1g_ <dig> and ss1g_ <dig> also harbored transcription factor domains. third, we selected  <dig> predicted speps that were retrieved based on sequence similarity to known effectors or ecs from other plant pathogenic fungi . we recovered the two necrosis and ethylene inducing peptides ssnep <dig> and ssnep <dig>  described in  <cit>  sharing ~40% identity with various nep-like proteins, and harboring a characteristic pfam domain . we selected ss1g_ <dig> for sharing 59% identity with colletotrichum hingginsianum effector candidate  <dig> . there was no protein domain identified in this protein but three-dimensional structure prediction indicates that it is analogous to alternaria alternata alta- <dig> allergen. we selected ss1g_ <dig> for sharing 35% identity with c. hingginsianum effector candidate  <dig> . it features a cyanovirin-n homology domain  that corresponds to a carbohydrate-binding module  <cit> . we identified ss1g_ <dig> showing 25% identity with m. oryzae effector avrpita  and harboring a m <dig> metalloprotease domain . finally we selected ss1g_ <dig> as similar  to pathogen-associated molecular patterns  with a cerato-platanin domain   <cit> . these  <dig> ecs identified based on protein annotations showed that the activity of s. sclerotiorum secretome may not be limited to typical cell death elicitors but is predicted to cover a wide range of functions known for fungal effectors, including chitin binding, proteases and protease inhibitors.table  <dig>

a family of subtilisin-inhibitor effector candidates conserved in ascomycetes
effectors with a protease inhibitor activity have been described in fungal plant pathogens with a biotrophic phase of infection  <cit> . we identified three s. sclerotiorum candidate effectors  with a serine protease inhibitor i <dig> domain  that corresponds to the propeptide inhibitor domain of subtilisins. to document the taxonomic distribution of ss1g_ <dig> homologs in fungi, we performed a blastp search against the predicted proteome of  <dig> fungal species. using signal peptide predictions, we identified  <dig> secreted homologs across  <dig> species. secreted homologs of ss1g_ <dig> are restricted to ascomycetes and found in all leotiomycete species considered . at the sequence level, homologs of ss1g_ <dig> are clearly distinct from c. fulvum avr <dig>  u. maydis pit <dig>  uromyces fabae rtp1p and m. lini avrp <dig>  suggesting that ss1g_ <dig> family represent a distinct class of protease inhibitor effectors. to get insights into ss1g_ <dig> function and evolution, we predicted the 3d structure of the protein and mapped residue conservation among the  <dig> secreted homologs on this structure. ss1g_ <dig> protein is predicted to adopt the structure of subtilisin pro-domain consisting of  <dig> beta-sheets facing two alpha-helices . the beta-sheets, interacting with the catalytic domain in subtilisins, are well conserved in fungi, whereas the exposed alpha-helices are more variable, suggesting that the ability to interact with subtilisins is conserved.figure  <dig>

sclerotinia effector candidates showing high ka/ks ratios
according to the red queen hypothesis, fungal pathogen effectors are predicted to evolve rapidly. signatures of natural selection were used to identify effectors and elicitors of immune responses in bacterial, oomycete and fungal plant pathogens  <cit> . to detect signatures of natural selection in spep genes, we calculated ka/ks ratios using yn <dig>  <cit>  on alignments between s. sclerotiorum and b. cinerea  <dig> core ortholog pairs. we obtained ka/ks values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with a median value of ~ <dig> . notably  <dig> genes  showed ka/ks >  <dig>  suggesting positive selection . to identify codon sites under positive selection in the five spep genes showing ka/ks >  <dig>  we used a bayesian inference approach on alignments of s. sclerotiorum  <dig>  b. cinerea b <dig>  and b.cinerea t <dig> orthologs. we could not detect sites with ka/ks >  <dig> in ss1g_ <dig> and ss1g_ <dig> using this dataset. we detected  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sites with ka/ks >  <dig> in ss1g_ <dig>  ss1g_ <dig> and ss1g_ <dig> mature proteins respectively. the p-value for positive selection using m <dig> and m8e models was  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> for ss1g_ <dig>  ss1g_ <dig> and ss1g_ <dig> respectively . interestingly, ss1g_ <dig> encodes a putative xylanase that may function as a virulence factor such as xylanases from other fungi  <cit> . to get insights on the constraints shaping the evolution of ss1g_ <dig> xylanase, we predicted the 3d structure of ss1g_ <dig> mature protein and mapped the local ka/ks ratios on this structure . all seven selected sites correspond to surface-exposed residues with three residing at the surface potentially interacting with plant xylanase inhibitors , three at the surface of the region corresponding to b. cinerea xyn <dig> necrotizing peptide  and one  modifying the surface of the substrate-binding pocket. these findings are consistent with adaptation to host and the possible involvement of ss1g_ <dig> in virulence.figure  <dig>

sclerotinia effector candidates encoded by recently duplicated genes
several effectors of filamentous plant pathogens evolved through gene duplication followed by rapid diversification  <cit> . to identify spep genes that underwent duplications since the divergence of s. sclerotiorum with b. cinerea, we grouped proteins from their whole predicted proteomes based on sequence similarity using markov clustering, and selected groups matching all three criterions:  containing at least  <dig> proteins,  containing at least one s. sclerotiorum spep gene and  containing more than 50% of proteins from s. sclerotiorum. we obtained  <dig> such groups including a total of 71 s. sclerotiorum proteins among which 29 s. sclerotiorum spep genes . groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contained only secreted proteins and probably carry effector-specific functions. group  <dig> and  <dig> contained spep genes identified as ecs based on the presence of cfem and lysm domains respectively . spep genes from group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had no conserved domain or homology to proteins of known function. in some pathogen genomes, the expansion of effector gene families is associated with the proximity to transposable elements  <cit> . to determine the repeat environment of s. sclerotiorum ecs, we annotated repeats in s. sclerotiorum genome, and calculated for all genes the distance to the nearest repeat. median distance to repeats is  <dig>  kbp across s. sclerotiorum genome and  <dig>  kbp for the  <dig> ecs that underwent recent duplications. nine duplicated ecs are located less than 2kbp apart from a retrotransposon and may have undergone duplication due to transposable element activity .figure  <dig>

s. sclerotiorum-specific effector candidates with toxin structural analogs
the emergence of virulence is frequently associated with a high rate of mutation, gene gain and gene loss in effector genes. this evolutionary pattern results in a discontinuous taxonomic distribution for effector genes  <cit> . to identify genes showing a discontinuous taxonomic distribution among s. sclerotiorum spep genes, we looked for homologs of all 486 s. sclerotiorum spep genes in the complete genome of  <dig> fungal pathogens with a necrotrophic phase of infection covering all major fungal lineages. as expected, the number of spep homologs identified in a given genome decreased with phylogenetic distance to s. sclerotiorum, with  <dig> speps  having homologs in b. cinerea and only  <dig>  having homologs in cryptococcus neoformans . forty-six spep genes had homologs in all  <dig> fungal species monitored, and  <dig> were s. sclerotiorum-specific, absent in the  <dig> other fungal species considered . among those, only six  had weak matches to pfam domains  other than domains of unknown function. we could not obtain information about the function of the  <dig> remaining spep genes based on annotation or homology.figure  <dig>

to get insights into the putative function of s. sclerotiorum-specific predicted speps with no annotation, we performed 3d protein structure predictions followed by fold-recognition searches with an aim to identify structural analogs of known function. we focused on  <dig> spep genes encoding mature proteins of at least  <dig> amino-acids and for which the best blastp hit is not a b. cinerea protein . we closely examined the predicted structures of three speps in comparison with their structural analogs. ss1g_ <dig> had analogy to the lectin domain of lectinolysin, a toxin forming pores in cell membranes regulated by sugar-binding through a lectin domain  <cit>  . ss1g_ <dig> had analogy to the hookworm saposin-like protein na-slp- <dig>  a toxin forming pores in membranes through lipid-binding activity  <cit>  . ss1g_ <dig> has analogy to the c-terminal domain of death-associated protein  <dig> , a member of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif4g protein family . cleavage of dap <dig> by caspases at its c-terminus induces apoptosis  <cit> . ss1g_ <dig> also had eif4g protein as closest analog . we propose that these ec are toxin analogs that may have emerged through convergent evolution and could contribute to s. sclerotiorum virulence.figure  <dig>

s. sclerotiorum effector candidate genes show diverse patterns of expression in planta
to test whether ecs identified in this work could play a role during interaction with host plants, we monitored the expression pattern after plant inoculation by quantitative rt-pcr for  <dig> ec genes, representative of the four lists of ecs identified through our bioinformatics analyses. for this, we inoculated four different host and model plants, including tomato, nicotiana benthamiana, arabidopsis thaliana resistant accession rubezhnoe and susceptible accession shahdara, and harvested samples at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 hours post-inoculation . s. sclerotiorum mycelium grown in vitro was used as a reference. we included the s. sclerotiorum ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene ss1g_ <dig> as non-induced control gene and the cerato-platanin gene ss1g_ <dig> as an in planta-induced control  <cit> . eight effector candidate genes showed in planta induction > <dig> on all four host plants tested. one gene  did not show in planta induction ≥ <dig> fold on any plant. using hierarchical clustering, we grouped effector candidate genes into five clusters according to their expression pattern . genes in cluster i show strong induction in planta over at least two time points; genes in cluster ii showed strong and early induction in n. benthamiana, but only moderate and late induction on other host plants; genes in cluster iii showed stronger induction on a. thaliana shahdara accession; genes in cluster iv showed late  induction, stronger on n. benthamiana and tomato; and genes in cluster v showed moderate induction at early time points . the cerato-platanin gene ss1g_ <dig> grouped in cluster iv.figure  <dig>

in their global analysis of s. sclerotiorum genome, amselem et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes encoding non-cazyme, non-peptidase secreted proteins. these secretome genes did not appear significantly enriched in genes induced in planta. in this study, we combined multiple bioinformatics approaches to identify a total of  <dig> predicted secreted proteins, among which  <dig> with experimental evidence for expression in planta . the predicted speps include ssnep <dig> and ssitl <dig> that have proposed to be s. sclerotiorum virulence factors  <cit> . since we have chosen to focus the search for effector candidates on these  <dig> spep genes, we have deliberately ignored genes expressed in planta for which experimental evidence is lacking, and enzymes that contribute to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites as virulence determinants. it is therefore expected that the diversity of s. sclerotiorum virulence factors exceeds that of the candidate effectors presented here. sequence similarity to known fungal effectors is a powerful method to uncover effector families conserved across species  <cit> , that allowed us to identify s. sclerotiorum homologs of b. cinerea nep <dig>  <cit>  and spl <dig>  <cit> , m. oryzae mgg_ <dig> and c. hingginsianum chec <dig> and chec <dig>  to complement this approach, we used pfam domain and nls motif searches to reveal additional effector candidates. we identified putative chitin-binding proteins, putative protease inhibitors, cystein-rich proteins and putative nuclear localized proteins. effectors with chitin binding activity such as c. fulvum ecp <dig>  m. oryzae slp <dig> and m. graminicola mg3lysm function in suppressing plant immunity  <cit> . similarly, ssitl <dig>  integrin-like secreted protein suppresses plant jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling pathways and enhances susceptibility  <cit> . these findings suggest that s. sclerotiorum secretes proteins able to suppress plant immunity.

the comparative analysis of fusarium graminearum secretome and genomes of other ascomycetes revealed a high level of conservation with only 25 f. graminearum specific out of  <dig> secreted proteins  <cit> . the taxonomic distribution of s. sclerotiorum spep homologues analyzed in this work supports the conservation of more than 50% of spep genes across ascomycetes. as proposed by brown et al.  <cit> , these core spep genes may support s. sclerotiorum epiphytic growth and highlight important distinctions between multiple phases in infection by this fungus  <cit> . nevertheless it also revealed  <dig> spep genes  specific to s. sclerotiorum, many of which are unannotated proteins. the systematic prediction of their 3d structure allowed identifying putative structural analogs of some predicted speps and suggests that they may carry unique functions to assist s. sclerotiorum pathogenicity. it will be interesting to take advantage of these predictions to test the biological function of these effector candidates and confront them to experimentally determined structures. furthermore, in spite of the limited sequence diversity included in the dataset analyzed here, we were able to detect signatures of positive selection in five s. sclerotiorum spep genes . similar frequency  has been reported in b. cinerea  <cit> . in the future, an in depth exploration of sequence diversity in s. sclerotiorum should allow to reveal more sites subjected to selection. spep genes for which positive selection has been detected encode cell wall degrading enzymes, including ss1g_ <dig> encoding a putative xylanase. this protein is related to b. cinerea xyn <dig> considered as a pathogen associated molecular pattern   <cit> . the detection of positive selection in ss1g_ <dig> is therefore consistent with the hypothesis that pamps may be characterized by signatures of positive selection in a background of strong negative selection  <cit> . it may therefore be hypothesized that a subset of s. sclerotiorum critical secreted enzymes are engaged in an evolutionary arms race with plant pattern recognition receptors, driving opposing forces of natural selection s. sclerotiorum effector genes. since plant inhibitors are known for many fungal cell wall degrading enzymes, it is also possible that an evolutionary arms race with plant inhibitors drives the evolution of some s. sclerotiorum effector candidates  <cit> . remarkably, we also identified  <dig> % of species-specific spep genes. the extent to which evolutionary constraints imposed by a broad host range contributes to diversification in the effector candidate repertoire of s. sclerotiorum remains to be determined. detailed functional analysis of effector gene alleles and their plant targets will be needed to address this question.

although s. sclerotiorum is considered as a typical necrotroph, there is evidence that it colonizes plant tissues through multiple phases involving important transcriptional and physiological reprogramming  <cit> . consistent with this model, the phytotoxin oxalic acid dampens plant immune responses at the initial stages of infection and later enhances programmed cell death  <cit> . in this work, we report the sequential transcriptional activation of s. sclerotiorum candidate effector genes. a > <dig> fold induction was measured at  <dig> hpi for several effector candidate genes, whereas no necrotic symptoms are visible at this time, except on a. thaliana shahdara accession. this suggests that the sequential secretion of effectors is required for the efficient induction of host cell death by s. sclerotiorum, or that some secreted proteins could contribute to s. sclerotiorum virulence independently of host cell death activation. by comparing the expression pattern of selected blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei genes grown on barley and on a. thaliana, hacquard et al.  <cit>  concluded that very divergent hosts do not significantly alter the fungal gene expression program. the expression pattern of some s. sclerotiorum ecs is indeed independent on the host plant being colonized . nevertheless, other ecs showed differential regulation in a host-dependent manner . the transcriptional activation of distinct set of effectors depending on the host being colonized has also been reported for the generalist root endophyte piriformospora indica in barley and a. thaliana  <cit> . the growing number of transcriptomic studies on various pathosystems should help determine whether host-dependent modulation of effector gene expression differs according to pathogens lifestyle or host range. we speculate that the white mold fungus benefits from a versatile repertoire of secreted proteins with diverse functions, evolution and expression patterns, to successfully infect a wide range of host plants. a systematic characterization of s. sclerotiorum transcriptome on multiple hosts and the functional analysis of differentially regulated effector genes should prove useful to decipher the molecular determinants of quantitative disease resistance and host range in this fungal pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we explored systematically the diversity of candidate virulence genes in the necrotrophic fungal pathogen s. sclerotiorum using in silico structure and evolution analyses. we report the identification of 486 s. sclerotiorum secreted proteins expressed in planta, including  <dig> ecs. we have analyzed in planta expression for a representative subset of  <dig> ecs, highlighting diverse predicted functions and expression patterns. this study reveals that besides plant degrading enzymes, s. sclerotiorum genome encodes numerous predicted secreted proteins that may be involved in the interaction between the fungus and its host plants. it will facilitate future investigation on their relevance in the infection process and sheds new light on the underestimated complexity of host colonization by necrotrophic plant pathogens.
