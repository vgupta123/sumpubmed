BACKGROUND

lycoris aurea  herb is a popular ornamental species of amaryllidaceae plant widely distributed in china. it belongs to the genus lycoris and the bulbs are very durable, tolerating the extremes of drought and waterlogging, as well as poor soil conditions. lycoris species possess the plentiful flower colours and shapes  <cit> , and are also important of medical values  <cit> . a variety of secondary metabolites known as amaryllidaceae alkaloids are found in lycoris, exhibiting many important pharmacological properties, such as immunostimulatory, anti-tumoral, anti-viral and anti-malarial activities  <cit> . for example, galanthamine, as a selective and reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor  <cit> , has been used worldwide in medicine for symptomatic treatment of alzheimer’s disease  <cit> ; lycorine, a pyrrolophenanthridine alkaloid, has been demonstrated to display very promising anti-tumor activity in animal and human cell lines  <cit> .

many detailed insights in biosynthetic steps of amaryllidaceae alkaloids production are revealed by the biochemical approaches labeling intermediates. in general, amaryllidaceae alkaloids are regarded as derivatives of the common precursor 4′-o-methylnorbelladine via intramolecular oxidative phenol-coupling  <cit> . there are three different groups of amaryllidaceae alkaloids that are biosynthesized by three modes of intramolecular oxidative c–c phenol coupling . the para-ortho’ oxidative coupling leads to galanthamine, para-para’ coupling gives rise to marithidine or crinine derivatives, and ortho-para’ coupling yields lycorine  <cit> . additionally, in some plants of amaryllidaceae family, the improved production of amaryllidaceae alkaloids was observed when treated with methyl jasmonate , or other elicitor like ethylene .

jasmonic acid  system is a key component in the complex plant hormone signaling systems. it is biosynthesized from α-linolenic acid by the octadecanoid pathway and oxygenation of α-linolenic acid is the initial step. the oxygen has to be inserted in the c- <dig> position by a lipoxygenase  to form -hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic acid   <cit> . 13-hpot is then utilized as substrates in the following reaction initiated by allene oxide synthase  and further converted to -12-oxo-phytodienoic acid  by allene oxide cyclase   <cit> . for further conversion, opda is translocated from chloroplasts to peroxisomes, where ja biosynthesis continues and a series of enzymes including opda reductase  <dig> , acyl-coa oxidase , multifunctional protein, and l-3-ketoacyl coa thiolase are involved in. ja and its derivatives, collectively referred to as jasmonates, are important signal molecules detected in a wide spectrum of plant species and function on a lot of biological processes including growth inhibition, senescence, wound response, plant defense and secondary mechanism  <cit> . for example, it was first demonstrated that an endogenous rise in ja levels upon elicitation with a rough yeast elicitor was associated with the induction of alkaloid synthesis in plant cell cultures  <cit> . later, by inducing taxoid biosynthesis with mj in taxus cuspidata cells, two cytochrome p <dig> cdna clones that encoded hydroxylases of the taxol biosynthetic pathway were identified  <cit> . additionally, exogenous mj elicits massive accumulation of caffeoylputrescine in tomato and this introduction is tightly controlled by the constitutive activation of the jasmonate signaling pathway  <cit> . broadly, three major classes of plant secondary metabolites defined as the terpenoids, alkaloids and phenylpropanoids were induced by jasmonates  <cit> .

in recent years, plant srnas are getting more and more attention for their regulatory roles in growth, development as well as defense process  <cit> . they are classified into two major categories: small interfering rnas  and micrornas   <cit> . mirnas negatively modulate the expression of a wide range of genes, at the post-transciptional levels by directing the mrna cleavage or by repressing translation  <cit> . mirnas have been shown to play crucial roles in plant responses to a variety of abiotic and biotic stresses, such as nutritional deficiency  <cit> , drought  <cit> , salinity  <cit> , cold  <cit> , heat  <cit> , heavy metal stress  <cit> , and disease  <cit> . additionally, many lines of evidences support that mirna-mediated gene regulation also plays a significant role in plant secondary metabolites biosynthesis  <cit> . previously, by using high-throughput sequencing, the taxoid elicitor mj-regulated taxus chinensis and arabidopsis mirna expression was observed  <cit> . however, little is sensed about mj-mediated mechanism on mirnas.

for investigating roles of mirnas in the regulation of biological process in l. aurea, we employed high-throughput sequencing technology to survey small rna pools in l. aurea experimentally treated with mj. our results indicate a complex and diverse small rna population exists in l. aurea, thereby providing a meaningful database to microrna study in lycoris species. moreover, our observation suggests that there be a correlation between the mj-elicited mirnas and l. aurea biological process such as amaryllidaceae alkaloids biosynthesis via a possible transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly analysis
we generated transcriptome database with the illumina hiseq <dig> system, after sequencing the two l. aurea cdna libraries from the mj-treated sample  and its untreated control . in total, each library comprises about  <dig>  million raw sequence reads. after removing poly  tails, short and low-quality tags, and adaptor contamination,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads with a total of  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotides were obtained respectively, for the two pools. due to the unavailability of the full genome sequences of l. aurea, the assembly software trinity  <cit>  was performed for de novo assembly of all the  <dig> , <dig> clean reads. combined with our gs flx titanium platform of  <dig> pyrosequencing transcriptome data reported previously  <cit> , the entire integrated transcriptome was subsequently used to analyze l. aurea srnas and degradome libraries.

high-throughput sequencing of ck and mj-treated small rna libraries
to perform a wide discovery of mirnas in l. aurea, we sequenced six small rna libraries constructed from control  and mj-treated  samples using the illumina sequencing platform. a total of more than  <dig>  million sequence reads were generated from all the samples, in the range  <dig> – <dig>  million for individual sample . after filtering out the adapter sequences as well as sequences with low quality, and further removing poly-a sequences and short rna reads smaller than  <dig> nucleotides and larger than  <dig> nucleotides, the total number of clean sequences were reduced to about  <dig>  million . the number of unique srnas ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million for individual sample . figure  <dig> shows size distribution of the srnas from the mj and ck libraries. the size distribution of the filtered sequence reads indicated the high-quality of the data and the majority of the small rna reads were distributed between  <dig> to 30 nt. the largest fraction of total srnas was 21 nt long in all the samples analyzed . this result was consistent with previous reports for other plant species, such as taxus mairei  <cit> , panax ginseng  <cit> , pinus contorta  <cit> , vitis vinifera  <cit>  and saccharina japonica  <cit> . additionally, size distribution analysis of the  <dig> , <dig> unique small rna sequences of all the samples showed that the 24 nt group was the biggest, which accounted for  <dig>  % of total unique sequences . it suggests that 24 nt srnas are the most diverse in l. aurea, which is similar to the results observed in other plant species  <cit> . overall, more than 75 % of the unique srnas in length were within the range of 21–24 nt. these observations were consistent with dicer-like  protein cleavage products and those reported in previous studies .table  <dig> statistical analysis of sequencing reads from the ck and mj <dig> srna libraries in l. aurea



fig.  <dig> the length distribution of total  and unique  small rna reads from mj-free  and mj-treated libraries of l. aurea. number of high-quality filtered total reads  of size 18– <dig> nt in different samples is shown




as a complete l. aurea genome sequence is not yet available, we mapped the sequenced srnas to the l. aurea transcriptome. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads  representing  <dig>  unique reads from all the samples were mapped to the transcriptome of l. aurea . however, only a small proportion of the unique srnas  mapped to the transcriptome of l. aurea. former study has found that a majority of mirna genes in plants were located in intergenic regions  <cit> . for example, among  <dig> mirna sequences identified in ectocarpus,  <dig> mirna sequences are located in introns, eight located in  <dig> intergenic regions, and one in a local antisense to a transposable element  <cit> . so it is possible that a high proportion of mirna loci in l. aurea is also located in the intergenic region and/or introns rather than in the gene exons in l. aurea.

identification of conserved and novel mirnas in l. aurea
according to alignment of the remaining sequences from the six libraries against all conserved/known mirnas in mirbase  with no mismatches and without gaps, a total of  <dig>  reads from all the samples were mapped on the mirbase plant mirnas, which resulted in the identification of a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique conserved mirnas from ck <dig>  ck <dig>  ck <dig>  mj <dig>  mj <dig>  and mj <dig>  respectively . many of these mirnas were present in one or more samples analyzed . a comparative analysis of mirnas identified from each sample led to the identification of a total of  <dig> non-redundant distinct conserved mirnas of size 18–24 nt in l. aurea. of  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> were present in all the samples analyzed . a significant fraction of the mirnas was also identified only from a specific sample . the size distribution analysis showed the predominant  representation of 21-nt-long mirnas . about both  <dig>  % of mirnas were 20-nt- and 22-nt-long, whereas only  <dig>  % was of the rest of the mirnas . further, most mirnas of different lengths harboured a uridine residue at the 5′-end . higher abundance of 21-nt-long mirnas with uridine as a 5′ terminal nucleotide in l. aurea correlates with other plant species reported before  <cit> . the 21-nt-long mirna with 5′-uridine is a characteristic feature of dcl <dig> cleavage and ago <dig> association, which has been found in most known mirnas  <cit> . further, the presence of multiple numbers of dcl and ago proteins can produce mirnas with different lengths, first nucleotide specificity and diverse functionality .fig.  <dig> microrna prediction in the samples of l.aurea. a number of mirnas identified in six samples are shown along with their specificity. the number of mirnas identified in all the samples , more than one sample, and those specific to each sample are given. b the length distribution of mirnas and the identity of the first nucleotide at 5′ residue




we also analyzed the nucleotide composition of mature mirnas in l. aurea. most  of the mirnas had a gc content within the range of 41–60 % . the average gc content of mature mirnas in l. aurea  was similar to that observed in populus , grapevine  and maize   <cit> . it has been suggested that the gc content of mirnas can be used as critical parameter for determining their biological roles  <cit> .

additionally, a total of  <dig>  % reads matched to structural non-coding rnas , repeat sequences and other sequences . after removal of these reads, the  <dig> , <dig> unannotated reads  representing  <dig> , <dig> unique reads were used for novel mirna prediction using the mirdeep <dig> pipeline. the processing involved extraction of precursor sequences from the transcriptome by extending mapped reads in the flanking regions, and its potential to form a stem-loop secondary structure. after processing, a total of only  <dig> novel mirna precursor candidates for ck and mj libraries were obtained . we also found that the average expression level of the novel mirnas was much lower than that of the conserved mirnas , implying that most of novel mirnas are young mirnas with imprecise processing and lack of targets  <cit> . our sequence analysis showed that the putative pre-mirnas of each library greatly varied from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length . some of the stem-loop secondary structures of predictive pre-mirnas of l. aurea could be found in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  in addition, mirdeep <dig> implemented other criteria, such as seed conservation and presence of mirna* evidence, which ensured high-confidence prediction of mirnas.

identification of mirna families and expression analysis of candidate mirnas in l. aurea
based on sequence similarity, we clustered all the identified l. aurea mirnas into families.  <dig> conserved mirnas were clustered into  <dig> known families and the number of mirnas in each family varied . among them, a few  of mirnas were represented only by a single member . this result indicates a kind of diversity of mirnas appeared in l. aurea. moreover,  <dig> mirna families out of  <dig> evolutionarily conserved mirnas were represented by more than one member, and most of the families  comprised at least five members. such large gene families have also previously been reported in plants  <cit> . heatmap by hemi software showing conserved mirna and corresponding mirna family expression patterns were also presented. as shown in fig. 3a, for mirna family expression, three samples for ck and three samples for mj were clustered into one group respectively, while the clustering of each mirna expression showed a different clustering pattern  . furthermore, we performed principal components analysis  to assess the variability of samples . the results showed a similar tendency appeared in fig. 3b.fig.  <dig> expression analysis of l.aurea mirna. heatmap showing mirna family  and conserved mirna  expression patterns




among the  <dig> known mirna families,  <dig> differentially expressed mirna families were identified according to the average expression levels between ck and mj . of these, ten mirna families were up-regulated in mj <dig> compared with ck, whereas ten mirna families showed down-regulated patterns . mj has been proven to play a key role in changing small rna expression profile in plants  <cit> . for example,  <dig> mirnas from seven different families  were down-regulated whereas three mirnas from two families  were up regulated in chinese yew  <cit> . interestingly, among above mentioned mirnas, we observed no mirna was induced by mj , which exhibit the same expression pattern under mj treatment in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, the average expression of mir <dig> in all the samples was down-regulated by  <dig> -fold in mj treatment when compared with the ck . it has been shown that mir <dig> play an important role in the response to the various abiotic stresses. for example, down-regulation of arabidopsis mir <dig> in response to oxidative stresses is important for two posttranscriptional csd mrna accumulation and oxidative stress tolerance  <cit> . heat stress rapidly induces arabidopsis mir <dig>  and this induction triggers a regulatory loop that is critical for thermotolerance  <cit> . under freezing stress, arabidopsis mir <dig> was repressed and chrysanthemum dichrum ice <dig>  regulated freezing tolerance of arabidopsis partly through the mir398-csd pathway  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been performed that ja acts with salicylic acid to confer basal thermotolerance in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . recently, jasmonate functions as a critical upstream signal of the ice-cbf/dre binding factor <dig>  transcriptional pathway to positively regulate arabidopsis freezing tolerance has also been revealed  <cit> . based on these results, we could speculate that mirna <dig> probably regulates a complex process in the response to mj in l. aurea. additionally, we also observed that the average expression of mir <dig> in all the samples was up-regulated by  <dig> -fold in mj treatment when compared with the ck . evidence has proven that constitutive expression of mir <dig>  a conserved monocot-specific small rna alters plant development and enhances tolerance to salinity stress and nitrogen starvation  <cit> . it also involves in the regulation of arsenite tolerance  <cit> .

on the other hand, a few mirna families, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  showed extraordinarily high expression levels in all the libraries, whereas others were present in much lower abundance. for example, mir <dig> family was the most abundant, with a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   reads accounting respectively . we also noticed that mir <dig>  which has been shown to be involved in the regulation of flowering time and floral development  <cit>  appeared decreased but not significant expression changes in mj treatment when compared with the ck . mir <dig>  another small rna regulating flowering time, showed almost no differential expression changes under mj treatemt in l. aurea .

by calculating log <dig> rpm value, the expression level of the mirnas including novel mirnas  was also identified . in all,  <dig> out of  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> out of  <dig> novel mirnas were identified as differently expressed mirnas based on the average expression levels of ck and mj samples . among them, most are down-regulated in response to mj. after restricting our analysis to differentially expressed mirnas with the following three criteria: read counts of each sample > <dig>  fdr < <dig>  and |fold change| > <dig>   <dig> differentially expressed mirnas indicating  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas were observed after the mj <dig> treatment . these data suggest that the differential regulation of mirnas account for functions in response to the mj treatment in l. aurea.fig.  <dig> validation and comparative relative expression of selected conserved and novel mirnas between the ck and mj <dig> libraries in l. aurea.

qrt-pcr validation of expression profiles of selected mirnas
to validate the mirna expression analysis results, we performed qrt-pcr of eight randomly selected conserved mirnas in all the samples analyzed . the qrt-pcr data showed a high degree of the agreement with the expression profiles obtained by small rna sequencing between the ck and mj <dig> libraries under mj treatment at 6 h. for example, a comparative analysis showed similar  expression patterns of half  of these mirnas obtained via small rna-seq and qrt-pcr analyses . additionally, we also observed a very good concordance in the expression patterns of mirnas obtained by both small rna-seq and qrt-pcr as indicated by the overall correlation coefficient  . similar result was also observed in other plant species  <cit> .fig.  <dig> correlation of gene expression results obtained from small rna-seq and qrt-pcr analysis for each  and all  selected mirnas in all the samples. the color scales represent log <dig> transformed normalized expression values for small rna-seq and qrt-pcr. the values between the two heatmaps represent correlation value between the expression profiles obtained from small rna-seq and qrt-pcr analysis for each mirna analyzed. the correlation values above  <dig>  are highlighted in bold




identification and annotation of targets for l. aurea mirnas
because mirnas function by regulating their target genes  <cit> , identifying the potential target genes of mirnas is crucially important for understanding mirna-mediated regulation mechanism during mj treatment. high-throughput degradome sequencing has been shown to be a valuable and efficient approach to validate and characterize target genes of mirnas in a variety of plant species  <cit> . the target genes of the mirnas under mj treatment were further studied by degradome library sequencing. in total, ~ <dig>  million  and ~ <dig>  million  clean reads were obtained. theses clean reads represent  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> unique reads from ck and  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> from mj <dig> degradome library . a total of  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  unique reads from ck and mj <dig> degradome libraries were mapped to the reference database . after identifying degraded targets for each of the mirnas, the abundance of each sequence was plotted, and the degradation products were grouped into five categories  according to their relative abundance . in all,  <dig> targets for the  <dig> mirnas were identified, involving  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas . among the mirna families,  <dig> targeted a single transcript, and the highest number of targets cleaved by a single mirna was  <dig> . some mrna targets , was possibly targeted by two mirnas .

a blastx search of the nr  database showed that the mirna targets shared homology with other plant proteins . a number of the identified targets for the known l. aurea mirnas were transcription factors, such as the auxin response factor  family, ethylene-responsive transcription factor, growth-regulating factor, squamosa promoter-binding like  protein, and gras family transcription factor . previous reports have also revealed transcription factors as the predominant targets of mirnas . for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig> targeted spls, mir <dig> targeted rap <dig> transcirption factors in l. aurea, suggesting that these three conserved mirnas might play significant roles in regulating flowering time and floral development  <cit> . some targets also appeared to be involved in signal transduction pathways, such as arfs and ethylene-responsive transcription factor . during arabidopsis adventitious root formation controlled by auxin-regulated ja homeostasis, arf <dig> and arf <dig>  targets of the mir <dig>  are positive regulators, whereas arf <dig>  a target of mir <dig>  is a negative regulator  <cit> . our result also showed that mir <dig> targeted arf <dig> . in addition, ja is also demonstrated to play important roles in plant signal transduction, metabolism, disease resistance, and response to environmental stresses  <cit> . a few transcripts targeted by conserved mirnas were involved in plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses, such as those encoding heat shock protein , ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig>  and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase . ubiquitin–proteasome-mediated proteolysis has also been shown to be involved in jasmonate signaling system  <cit> . so it could be possible that mirna-mediated regulation pathway affects jasmonate signaling indirectly.fig.  <dig> mirna target alignment and its t-plot validated by degradome sequencing of l. aurea. a la-mir398a and cl <dig> contig <dig> . b la-mir156a and cl <dig> contig <dig> . c la-mir160g and cl <dig> contig <dig> . d la-mir <dig> and cl <dig> contig <dig> . both the arrow and the dot represent the splice site on the mirna target




previously, the mj-induced amarylideceae alkaloids accumulation has been reported . according to the transcriptome sequencing, we identified and summarized some genes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, tydc, o-methyltransferase , cyps, and n-methyltransferase , might be implicated in amarylideceae alkaloid galanthamine biosynthesis  <cit> . in the present study, a few of them including cytochrome p <dig>   and tyrosine decarboxylase   were indentified to be targeted by mirnas . tydc is responsible for the conversion of tyrosine to tyramine  <cit> . cyps are able to conduct an intramolecular c–c phenol coupling reaction in plant alkaloid biosynthesis, and at least two cyp-families  have acquired this ability  <cit> . whether the two cyps identified here are involved in the c–c phenol coupling reaction will need further investigation. another central feature in the biosynthesis of amarylideceae alkaloids is methyl transduction at multiple positions of the norbelladine core structure and norgalanthamine, and the reactions are considered to be mediated by omt and nmt respectively  <cit> . in our condition, neither mirna-targeted omt nor nmt was found. at the moment, it is difficult to conclude whether mirnas are also involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of amarylideceae alkaloids biosynthetic genes, as many l. aurea specific mirna might not be found in the present analysis pipeline.

plant mirnas generally direct endonucleolytic cleavage of mrnas, consistent with the suggestion that plant mirnas enable rapid clearance of target mrnas at specific points during plant development  <cit> . this hypothesis predicts a negative correlation between the expression of a mirna and its target mrnas within a given tissue or organ. by comparing the expression levels of the differentially expressed mirnas with the expression levels of their known and predicted targets, former study has showed that mirna expression is generally anticorrelated with that of targeted mrnas  <cit> . in our study, to investigate the correlation between mirnas and its target mrna, a total of  <dig> data points  were shown in the scatter plot . we also observed a negative but not obvious correlation  in the expression patterns of mirnas and their targets .fig.  <dig> correlation of expression results obtained from small rna-seq and rna-seq analysis for corresponding targets from l.aurea ck and mj samples. a total of  <dig> data points  are shown in the scatter plot. each data point represents the log <dig> normalized expression level obtained from small rna-seq  and rna-seq analyses of targets 




CONCLUSIONS
a number of mirnas with diverse expression patterns, and complex relationships between expression of mirnas and targets were identified. this is the first report on the transcriptome/degradome-wide identification of known and novel mirnas and their targets in response to mj in l. aurea. the findings could advance our understanding of the functional characterization of mirnas and their targets in regulating plant response to mj treatment. this study also provides the first glimpse of the complex regulation of the amarylideceae alkaloid biosynthetic pathway in l. aurea.
