BACKGROUND
genotyping with the molecular markers - detecting the heritable polymorphisms among the individuals of one or more populations - are employed in many regions in modern biological research including phylogeny, evolution, plant breeding and disease research, etc.
. the classical molecular markers, such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms , randomly amplified polymorphic dna , amplified fragment length polymorphisms  and simple sequence repeats  were proven to be powerful in genotyping. however, based on gel electrophoresis, these methods usually take long time and high labor costs with large samples size. in addition, the dna polymorphisms with artificial bands counting are prone to error. moreover, these methods generally produce limited markers, making it difficult to construct high density genetic map that is essential for chromosomes assembly. therefore, the fast, cost-effective and high-throughput genotyping techniques are required.

now, with the advent of next-generation sequencing , there are several such approaches, which are capable of genotyping not hundreds but thousands of markers in a single step
 <cit> . some newly developed techniques, combining ngs with restriction enzymes  fragments, are widely used for genotyping. these techniques internally sequence the regions around res recognition sites; produce a reduced representation of a genome. the restriction-site associated dna  technique is capable of sequencing the regions adjacent to recognition site of a chosen restriction enzyme and widely applied to detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms , even insertions/deletions , for quantitative trait locus  or evolutional analysis
. with a simple, quick library approach and lower coverage requirement, genotyping-by-sequencing  is particularly well suited for genotyping populations with large samples sizes
. two-enzyme gbs and double digest rad sequencing are the other two reduced representation libraries both based on simultaneous double res digestion, which are also used for snp discovery and genotyping
 <cit> .

the 2b-rad  approach relies on the type iib res, such as bsaxi or alfi , to produce uniform tags. it was proven to be a simple and flexible method for genome-wide genotyping
 <cit> . poland ja et.al compared many reduced representation libraries and concluded that 2b-rad approach had the advantages of producing uniform length tags, allowing nearly all of the restriction sites to be surveyed and permitting marker intensity adjustment
 <cit> . however, there is still plenty of room for improvement of the existent 2b-rad approach. firstly, it is not as multiplex as other reduced representation libraries using barcode adapter and pooling procedure. by using barcode adapters, many samples equal to one sample to carry on the subsequent library procedures after pooling. therefore, it can save much time and labor cost. the rad’s multiplexing level achieves  <dig> samples while the gbs achieves  <dig> up to  <dig>  for instance
 <cit> . the existent 2b-rad approach achieves its multiplexing sequencing by using indexed pcr primers. the disadvantage is that each sample is prepared to a single sequencing library. it takes more times and labor cost, and is not fit for the populations with large sample size. lacking of fast library approach would limit its application. secondly, the information of 2b-rad tags, such as tags numbers and distributions, in most of species are unknown except arabidopsis thaliana
 <cit> . in order to make better use of it, it is necessary to do a comprehensive testing.

based on the above reasons, firstly, we tried to improve the existent 2b-rad library approach. at the present times, multiplex sequencing methods have been developed for ngs using either barcoded adapters, especially in reduced representation library
, or indexed amplification primers
. we attempted to combine these two methods together to develop a new multiplexing 2b-rad library approach. twelve adapters with different barcodes were designed in this research and  <dig> samples could be pooled together. to validate the new approach, we prepared  <dig> 2b-rad libraries containing  <dig> samples from a rice  f <dig> population. the population was genotyped and a genetic linkage map was constructed. the markers were aligned with nipponbare reference to measure the accuracy of the genetics map. moreover, series of bioinformatics simulate analysis of 2b-rad tags based on ten plants and ten animals’ reference genomes were carried out. processing with methylation-sensitive res, it is difficult to predict which recognition sites would be digested in gbs. so we only compared rad and 2b-rad tags on these species. the tag numbers and distributions were analyzed specifically.

methods
comparison of rad and 2b-rad tags
the res recognition sites, including ecori, sbfi and hindiii for rad, bsaxi and alfi for 2b-rad, were detected on the reference genomes containing  <dig> plants and  <dig> animals. each sequence of “gaattc” , “cctgcagg”  and “aagctt”  tested on the genomes was regarded as one recognition site, producing two tags for rad
 <cit> ; each sequence of “acnnnnnctcc”, “ggagnnnnngt”  and “gcannnnnntgc”  was regarded as one recognition site, producing one tag for 2b-rad, respectively.

the ecori was one of the most commonly used res for rad. for 2b-rad, the recognition sites of bsaxi were much more than alfi by simulation. the recognition bases of ecori and bsaxi were both six. so the application potential of ecori and bsaxi were compared. the genomes size was divided by ecori sites numbers. the average fragment length was approximately 4000 bp of the  <dig> species, indicating that ecori recognition sites located once per 4000 bp. each 4000 bp sequence was regarded as a window and represented a simulated tiny scaffold. the recognition sites equaled  <dig>   <dig> and more than  <dig> in these scaffold denoted different potentiality of assembly. zero indicated that the scaffold was impossible to be connected to any chromosome; one indicated the scaffold could be connected with no orientation; more than one indicated potential perfect assembly with an orientation. the sites of ecori and bsaxi were detected in these tiny scaffolds to estimate their potentiality for chromosome assembly.

f <dig> populations
the f <dig> population materials including two f <dig> parents and 277 f <dig> progeny were gained from the rice genetic breeding laboratory of china agricultural university. of the two parents, the female was nipponbare while the male was a stable recombinant inbred line for five generations of oryza sativa spp. japonica line whose ancestry derived from a cross between two japonica varieties. one was nipponbare, and the other was a chinese landrace with the name of mayi danru. the parents and their progeny, altogether  <dig> dna were extracted from their fresh leaves according to doyle’s protocol
 <cit> . the dna only with a lowest concentration of 50 ng/μl and no degradation were able to be applied for the following 2b-rad library.

adapter design
to create a simple and quick 2b-rad library approach with pooling procedure, we designed two kinds of adapters. adapter <dig> with 5–9 bp barcodes was complementary to the illumina multiplexing pcr primer  <dig> ; adapter <dig> was complementary to index primer. the digested fragment of bsaxi was 33 bp with 3 bp random overhangs on the 3′ ends. the sequences of the adapter <dig> were:5′-acactctttccctacacgacgctcttccgatctxxxxxnnn-3′ and 5′-yyyyyagatcggaagagcgtcgtgtagggaaagagtgt-3′, the “xxxxx” and “yyyyy” denoted the barcode and its complement sequences. the nnn was complementary to the 3 bp sticky end generated by bsaxi . the adapter <dig> was:

5′- agatcggaagagcacacgtctgaactccagtcac -3′ and 5′-gtgactggagttcagacgtgtgctcttccgatctnnn-3′. the annealed adapter <dig> and adapter <dig> were adjusted to 5 μm as working concentration.



the bsaxi digested fragment was only 33 bp and it would be completely sequenced by single-end 50 bp , so a little longer  barcodes would not reduce the tag sequence. the barcodes were designed according to poland ja’s criteria
 <cit>  and made slight modification.  the lengths of barcodes were different form  <dig> to 9 bp to maximize the balance of bases at each position, especially in the bsaxi recognition sites.  the barcodes must be two or more bp different from all other barcodes.  the barcodes can’t contain or recreate  bsaxi restriction site. a set of  <dig> barcode sequence were designed .

2b-rad library preparation
the concentrations of all dna samples were adjusted to 50 ng/μl. the dna  was digested in 10 μl reaction volume of neb buffer  <dig> with  <dig> u bsaxi  at 37°c for 2 h. an additional dna was digested simultaneously to detect the digestion efficiency by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. the primary dna band disappeared and became disperse, indicating a successful digestion. then the ligation reaction was completed in the same tube as the digestion, combining the remaining digested dna with 2 μl of the adapter <dig>  2 μl of the adapter <dig>  2 μl ligase buffer and  <dig> u of the t <dig> ligase . bsaxi could not be inactivated by heating, so the digested productions was recommended performing the ligations in 4°c for 1 hour, then hold on ice
 <cit> .

for exploring the relationship between sequencing data size and enzyme sites coverage, each parents repeated  <dig> times in library experiment. all  <dig> dna samples  were divided into  <dig> groups. each group contained  <dig> samples and the last group contained  <dig> samples. the samples in each group were ligated with different  <dig> adapters.

twelve samples in a group were pooled together when they were purified using purification kit . the ligated productions were completely combined to keep the amount of pooled dna as 1 ~  <dig>  μg, which was sufficient for the following pcr procedure. the samples in each group with different barcode adapters were gathered to a tube which had been added the wash buffer of purification kit beforehand. then the pooled dna was purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 25 μl eb .

the illumina multiplexing pcr primers were used for amplification. the sequences were:5′-aatgatacggcgaccaccgagatctacactctttccctacacgacgctcttccgatct-3′  and

5′-caagcagaagacggcatacgagatxxxxxxgtgactggagttcagacgtgtgctcttccgatct-3′ , where the six “x” represented a 6 bp index. the index primer sequences were derived from a bgi patent 
 <cit> . for each pcr, we combined 50 ng of pooled dna, 1 μl of each primer , buffers, nuclease-free water and phusion polymerase  at a final 50 μl total volume. temperature cycling consisted of 98°c for 30 seconds followed by 12 cycles of 98°c for 30 seconds, 65°c for 30 seconds, 72°c for 30 seconds with a final taq extension step at 72°c for 5 minutes. four kinds of index primers were used in this study for distinguishing the libraries . the expected tag fragment after pcr was from 160 bp to 164 bp . pcr production was detecting by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and then the 150–200 bp bands were cut and purified by the purification gel kit  and eluted in 30 μl eb.



the quantify molarity and library fragment size distribution of cleaned dna were detected by an agilent bioanalyzer. quantification was conducted by qpcr. se <dig> sequencing of four 12-plex libraries per flowcell channel lane was performed on hiseq  <dig> platform . totally six lanes were used.

the detailed protocol of whole 2b-rad library procedure was available on additional file
 <dig>  the complementary relationships of all the sequence used in 2b-rad library were showed on figure 
 <dig> figure  <dig> 
the complementary relationships of all the sequence. the same color represented complementation.



filtering raw sequence data
the reads filtering steps were performed by our own perl scrip as follows.  matched one of the  <dig> barcodes allowing one mismatch. after the reads were assigned into each sample, the 5– <dig> bases barcode were removed.  the reads following on the heels of the barcode should perfectly matched bsaxi fragment “nnnnnnnnnnnnacnnnnnctccnnnnnnnnnn” or “nnnnnnnnnnggagnnnnngtnnnnnnnnnnnn”  with no “ns” . then the reminder bases of each read were deleted. two kinds of 33 bp tags containing the recognition sites “acnnnnnctcc” or “ggagnnnnngt” were obtained. they were regarded as high quality reads.

the two cohesive ends of bsaxi digestion fragment were identical, so the adapter <dig> was probably ligated to any ends of the fragment, as well as the adapter <dig>  so a fragment with many copies after dna extracting and digestion, was ligated to adapters of couple of possibilities. however, only the fragment which was ligated adapter <dig> and adapter <dig> simultaneously could be pcr amplified. the fragment with only 33 bp length, was probably sequenced both form plus strand and minus strand . in order to solve this problem, all the tags contained “ggagnnnnngt” were translated to their reverse compliment sequences, namely, the form of “acnnnnnctcc”. and then the tags contained only one strand of the digestion fragments.figure  <dig> 
the tag with many copies which was probably sequenced both form plus strand and minus strand. the a and b revealed that the adapter <dig> and adapter <dig> may ligate to any ends of the 33 bp digested fragment and the tag would be sequenced from any 5′ end.



the tag mapping
for estimating bsaxi sites coverage, firstly, simulant detections of the bsaxi sites in nipponbare reference genome were carried out. the 33 bp fragments in reference containing recognition sites of “ggagnnnnngt” or “acnnnnnctcc” were picked out. then these sequences were mapped to reference using bowtie  with the parameter of -m  <dig> -v  <dig> allowing  <dig> mismatches. the sequences which aligned with only one location were regarded as unique tags and the expected potential markers.

secondly, the high quality reads of  <dig> samples were mapped to nipponbare reference . the mapped reads were detected whether they covered simulant tags.

to look for the relationship between sequencing data size and bsaxi sites coverage, a testing was performed based on several combinations of  <dig> repeated female samples. the female was nipponbare, as well as the reference genome. therefore the testing could accurately reflect the relationship.

after digestion, the fragments between two recognition sites also possessed sticky end “nnn” as follows.


the structure made the fragments possible to be ligated with adapters and performed pcr amplification. if their length was nearly 33 bp, they would not be removed in the agarose gel size selection and be sequenced. so the reads matched barcodes while not matched bsaxi recognition sites were analyzed. after removing redundant sequences , they were mapped to nipponbare reference genome .

snp calling with and without reference
any two of the female samples combination could cover nearly 100% of the simulant res sites, so we combined female- <dig> and female- <dig> together  to perform snp-calling. same treatment to male samples of male- <dig> and male- <dig> were performed.

the snp calling without references were performed using stacks 
 <cit>  with four programs. the parameters were -m  <dig> -m  <dig> -n  <dig> for ustacks, -n  <dig> for cstacks, default for sstacks and -m  <dig> -t f <dig> -o joinmap -c --min_hom_seqs  <dig> --min_het_seqs  <dig>  --max_het_seqs  <dig>  for genotypes. the “-m” in genotypes means minimum reads depth for genotype. we used –m  <dig> as the depth and the automated corrections system  in consideration of the lower sequencing depth of the progeny. the markers of aa x bb style were selected for genetic map. meanwhile, the female tags of these markers were mapped to nipponbare .

to construct the genetic linkage map, the markers derived from stacks were pretreated. the markers with less than 20% missing rate  were preserved. the linkage analysis was performed using joinmap . the snp genotypes in f <dig> population were expected to segregate at a 1:2: <dig> ratio. distorted markers  were filtered by χ <dig> test. the parameters using joinmap were “independence lod” for grouping method, “regression mapping” for mapping algorithm, “kosambi’s” for mapping function method. the groups with less than  <dig> markers were discarded. each linkage map marker’s location in alignment result was retrieved to measure accuracy of the genetic map. of the sorted markers via genetic distances in each group, the one which was significantly opposite the mainstream of the order  was regarded as “order error” marker.

to roughly evaluate snp numbers between two parents, the other way for genotyping relied on reference genome. firstly, reads of two parents were mapped to the nipponbare reference using soap <dig>  with default. the aligned reads were performed snp calling using soapsnp  with default. the snps in cns file  were preserved only when the quality score of consensus genotype were more than  <dig>  after integrating their snp results, the genotype of aa x bb style between two parents were obtained. the two results between soapsnp and stacks were compared.

the res recognition sites of rad and 2b-rad in simulated species were listed in table

the average value that genome size divided by ecori recognition sites number was 3647 bp in plants and 3833 bp in animals. we employed 4000 bp as a window to detect the presence numbers of ecori and bsaxi recognition sites. overall,  <dig> windows were detected. the windows where ecori recognition sites numbers equaled  <dig>   <dig> and more than  <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the equivalents for bsaxi were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> .

in addition, we detected the recognition sites numbers of bsaxi in the windows where ecori recognition sites numbers were  <dig> or  <dig>  zero or one meant that these windows were impossible to be perfectly assembled to a chromosome. there were  <dig>  and  <dig> windows , and the percentages were 45%  and 78% . the simulations of ecori = <dig>  bsaxi > <dig> and ecori = <dig>  bsaxi > <dig> both indicated that the windows contained more than one res recognition sites. this fact revealed that the perfect assembled windows were significantly increased after adding the bsaxi tags. the windows contained at least two recognition sites was up to  <dig> % of the total windows.

RESULTS
overall, the  <dig> libraries of  <dig> lanes produced  <dig> raw reads, equaling to  <dig> gbp raw data. each lane produced  <dig>  gbp data on average. the number of the reads matched barcode was  <dig> . the reads matched both barcode and bsaxi recognition sites were  <dig> . these reads were regarded as high quality reads, including  <dig>  reads which were the style of “acnnnnnctcc” and  <dig>  reads which were “ggagnnnnngt”. the  <dig> reads were translated to the style of “acnnnnnctcc” before genotyping. totally  <dig>  raw reads were filtered. of these filtered reads,  <dig>  were filtered on account of barcode match failure and  <dig>  were filtered by bsaxi sites match failure.

each sample’s reads divided by barcode were from  <dig> to  <dig>  the ratio of the maximum divided by minimum was  <dig> . after bsaxi sites matching step, the high quality reads were from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the ratio was  <dig>  . on average, each sample was given  <dig> high quality reads, equaling to  <dig> mbp.figure  <dig>

discussion
2b-rad library approach improvement
the 2b-rad approach was invented by wang in  <dig> and was proven as a simple and flexible method for genome-wide genotyping
 <cit> . however, this technique was rarely used in the published researches. lacking of pooling library approach as other reduced representation libraries, made it take more manpower and time, and may partly explain the reason.

the existent reduced representation libraries, such as rad, gbs, two enzyme gbs and double digested rad, were all pooling library sequencing techniques. the barcode adapters of rad and double digested rad were phosphorylated in 5′ end, which made them more expensive in adapter cost than gbs and two enzyme gbs whose adapters were not phosphorylated. moreover, to mix many libraries for multiplexing sequencing in a flowcell lane, the indexed primer was widely used in illumina hiseq platform. for saving library cost, we used the non-phosphorylated adapters and the index primer. the combination of these two methods achieved that using  <dig> barcode adapters completed the pooling library and multiplexing sequencing rather than using  <dig> or  <dig> barcode adapters. however, this approach was not only the method for improving the existent 2b-rad library approach. the barcode adapters and pcr primers like the style of rad, gbs, two enzyme gbs or double digested rad methods could also be modified to fit for 2b-rad. the method in this research was just a comparatively cost-effective method for materials costs.

for library experiment, the method comprised digestion, ligation, pooling, pcr and size selection. comparing with wang’s approach, the method added a size selections procedure, but reduced a step of pcr. the size selection was inevitably, because the fragments between two res recognition sites could also be ligated with adapter and amplified. they had a large amount reveled by the agarose gel electrophoresis outside 150–200 bp .

anyhow, the improved library approach reduced manpower and time cost. completing a library including  <dig> samples took only 5 hours. achieving  <dig> libraries containing  <dig> samples within a day wouldn’t be a problem. so this method was suit for large sample size population.

the merits and demerits of the method
by filtered step,  <dig> % of the raw reads were filtered. the  <dig> % of the filtered reads were mapped to reference, indicating that most of these reads may be the fragments between two bsaxi recognition sites. for easy operation, 150–200 bp dna bands were selected in library procedure. the bands in this region which were less than  <dig> or more than  <dig> were probably the fragments between two bsaxi recognition sites and so useless data increased. using more accurate dna markers to select the 160–164 bp fragments, could reduce the useless data.

the evenness of each sample reads was important. the reads number differing too big could make analysis difficult and inaccurate. of the high quality reads, the ratio about the maximum reads numbers divided by minimum reads number was  <dig> , showing a high evenness. the sample in each library was only  <dig>  making it easy to keeping the same amount mixing. a library containing  <dig> samples were not so easy to keep evenness in experimental operation. this was another reason why we used only  <dig> barcodes for a library. of course, the barcode adapters could be increased as needed.

the average depth of each bsaxi site was  <dig> . for  <dig> stacks markers,  <dig> markers  were filtered with a higher missing ratio and  <dig> markers  were filtered by χ <dig> test. for the genetic map result, four groups were divided by a higher lod value. some genetics group could not directly gather into a chromosome . the genetic group corresponding to chromosome  <dig> revealed that many markers showed order error. for chromosome  <dig>  fewer markers were assigned to one chromosome arm. meanwhile, the alignment result of all stacks markers revealed wide distribution in chromosome . these demerits indicated that the progeny’s genotypes were not accurate enough. it may attribute to the lower sequencing depth. by the detection of res sites, we found bsaxi sites were more than ecori, especially in oryza sativa. the average depth of  <dig>  × was a bit lower to confirm heterozygote genotypes. the low-quality data of progeny made that  <dig> % of the stacks marker were filtered and just right most of the markers in one arm of chromosome  <dig> were filtered. to overcome the shortcomings, the sequencing data should be increased. however, only one marker was aligned to inappropriate chromosome and  <dig> markers revealed significant order errors, proving the practicability of the approach.

the snps between two parents calculated by soapsnp were  <dig>  while by stacks were  <dig>  the soapsnp was not the professional software for reduced representation genome analysis. it was used for roughly estimating the total snps in this research. the comparing results between soapsnp and stacks revealed that the actual snps were approximately  <dig> to  <dig>  the markers for genetic map were  <dig>  of the published rad or gbs researches for genetic map analysis, the final marker numbers were from several hundreds to thousands
. the female parent was nipponbare, while the male could trace its ancestry to nipponbare. the two parents had close relationships. however,  <dig> markers were obtained which were comparable to published rad or gbs researches. using more distantly related parents would receive more snps.

the alignment result of stacks markers revealed that  <dig> pairs of markers had overlaps. they could be assembled to long tags to discover snps. but the probability of the overlapped makers was too low for more valuable applications.

the practical application in the future
the most important function of reduced representation libraries is genotyping, namely, the marker  discovery. based on these markers, the genetic map can be constructed, comprising two main applications: qtl fine mapping
 and de novo chromosomes assembly
 <cit> .

one recognition sites of rad could produce two tags, making hindiii had the most simulant tags in  <dig> species on average. meanwhile, the rad tags were long enough to carry out single-end 90 bp sequencing. in addition, rad had another application - paired end sequencing for de novo assembly and marker design
 <cit> . possessing more and long tags means more chance to obtain snps, so rad was more effective than 2b-rad in snp discovery. however, the two tags produced by one rad res site located together. two tags which stand together amount to one marker in linkage map. so marker density for genetic map is mainly depending on the numbers of scattered recognition sites rather than tags. the res for rad all possess palindromic recognition sites, as well as alfi, while bsaxi doesn’t. two kinds of recognition sites result that bsaxi have the most recognition sites, making 2b-rad approach is potentially more effectively than rad for constructing high density genetic map. it should be noted that the progeny’s genotypes were not accurate in this research and may be attributed to the lower sequencing depth. the combinations of  <dig> repeated female samples’ results revealed that doubled data size increased the bsaxi sites coverage to almost 100%. to solve the problem for gaining more accurate data, the one way is to increase sequencing data by doubling lanes. the samples can be reduced to  <dig> of  <dig> libraries in a single lane and the total lanes rise to  <dig>  in addition, the design of adapters and pcr primers in this research made 2b-rad tags could be either performed single-end sequencing or paired-end sequencing . the pe <dig> and pe <dig> reads from paired-end 50 bp  sequencing would be entirely over merged. hence, except adding flowcell lanes, the other way to double data size is to use paired-end sequencing. in commonly, with a same total data size, a pe lane is more inexpensive than two se lanes. the paired-end sequencing strategy for 2b-rad with a significant cost advantage is worth popularizing in the future applications.

the marker density of genetic map is important for de novo chromosomes assembly because possessing more markers for a contig or scaffold means more chance to be perfectly assembled. by the assembly simulation, the tiny scaffolds which were potentially perfectly assembled were 28% for ecori and 47% for bsaxi, indicating 2b-rad using bsaxi were more effective in chromosomes assembly. of course, simultaneous use of ecori and bsaxi markers, the perfect assembly rate rose to  <dig> %.

using several hundreds of dna markers is common and sufficient for typical qtl mapping studies. therefore, rad-qtl approach often use a rare-cutter enzyme  to increase read count per rad tag per individual and reduce sequencing cost per individual
. meanwhile, the qtl study using ddrad - sequencing permitted sequencing of over  <dig> individuals in a single hiseq  <dig> lane
 <cit> . the lower requirement of makers in qtl-research for 2b-rad could be adjusted by two ways. one is to use alfi. the density of alfi sites was nearly 1/3th in plants or 1/2th in animals of bsaxi by simulation. the other way is to use the adapters with 5′-nnf-3′ overhangs  that targeted 1/16th  of all bsaxi sites
 <cit> . the digested fragment of alfi has 2 bp random overhangs on the 3′ ends. for modified adapters with 5′-nf-3′ overhangs for alfi, the targeted sites were also reduced to 1/16th . an addition comparison of the enzyme sites number was list on table 
 <dig>  the result indicated that 1/16th of alfi sites was nearly the same sites of sbfi in plants; while 1/16th of bsaxi sites was nearly the same sites of sbfi in animals. the adapters with the overhangs of “nnt”  or “nnr”  also could be used to increase markers than “nnf” if the marker density used by “nnf” adapters are fewer. so the adapter could be flexibly deployed of the fixed bases in its 3′ overhangs according to marker density requirement, making 2b-rad technique have multiple uses.table  <dig>

a detailed scheme of how to apply 2b-rad approach in practice was showed on table 
 <dig>  taking oryza sativa for instance, sequencing of over  <dig> individuals in a single hiseq  <dig> lane also can be achieved. of course, genotyping of this approach can be used for natural population evolutional analysis.table  <dig> 
the scheme of how to apply i2b-rad approach


the count of samples by 1/16th of alfi adapter were calculated based on the simulate data on table 
 <dig>  the alfi sites were nearly 1/2th of the bsaxi in oryza sativa.



CONCLUSIONS
by using barcodes adapters,  <dig> samples were pooled together as one sample to carry on following library procedure. it was not complicated for experiment operators to completing a library including  <dig> samples within 5 hours. achieving  <dig> libraries containing  <dig> samples within one day wouldn’t be a problem. the improvement of using barcodes adapters made 2b-rad library preparation become sample and fast. furthermore, the bioinformatics simulation and f <dig> population genotyping revealed that 2b-rad data using bsaxi were effective for high density genetic map. more applications could be achieved by adjustment of enzyme and adapters. so an improved 2b-rad genotyping approach was established in this research and named as i2b-rad.
