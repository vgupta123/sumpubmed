BACKGROUND
interferons  are cytokines that play a major role in host defense against viral pathogens  <cit> . mammalian type i ifns  are produced by many cell types and confer antiviral activities on them, while type ii ifn  is produced mainly by t lymphocytes and natural killer cells when stimulated by macrophage derived cytokines. ifnγ elicits broad effects, particularly on cells of the immune system. the transmission of both type i ifns and ifnγ signals are dependent on the activation of the transcription factor stat <dig> . stat family proteins are critical to the action of most cytokines and growth factors, as they are latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that directly activate signaling pathways upon being phosphorylated  <cit> .

the activation of stat is encompassed as part of evolutionary conserved pathways by which signals can be transduced from the membrane to the nucleus rapidly. the classical view is that type i ifn  signals through stat1/stat <dig> heterodimers, while ifnγ signals through stat <dig> homodimers  <cit> . the binding of secreted type i ifns to the two subunit receptor  results in activation of the janus-activated kinase  <dig>  and tyrosine kinase  <dig> , which are associated with the cytoplasmic tail of ifnar1/ <dig>  the signal is cascaded further by tyrosine phosphorylation of stat <dig> and stat <dig>  <cit> . the stats heterodimerize and together with interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  form a complex named isgf <dig>  this complex enters the nucleus where it associates with specific promoter elements  to activate the transcription of ifn-stimulated genes   <cit> . ifnγ signals through an ifnγ-specific receptor  to jak <dig> and jak <dig> resulting in tyrosine phosporylation and homodimerization of stat <dig>  <cit> . stat <dig> homodimers enter the nucleus and bind the ifnγ-activation site  which is present in the promoter of certain isgs  <cit> . however, in addition to the phosphotyrosine sh <dig> domain interactions of the active forms of stats, unphosphorylated stats can form dimers of a different conformation through their n-terminal domain  <cit> . also, stat <dig> can be found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus without cytokine stimulation of cells  <cit> .

facilitated nuclear translocation of such large complexes requires the nuclear pore complex  <cit> . stat <dig> and stat <dig> do not contain classical nuclear localization signals  which is normally necessary to be recognized by the importin receptor, but dimerization of stats results in conformational changes that establish nls activity  <cit> . after activation of their target genes, stats are dephosphorylated, released from the dna and shuttled back to the cytoplasm  <cit> . consistent with the importance of this pathway in mediating the actions of ifns, mice with no stat <dig> have no innate response to either bacterial or viral infections as a result of dysfunctional ifn signaling  <cit> . moreover, a number of viruses have the capacity to block the activation of stat <dig> by ifn to evade the defense from the host immune system  <cit> .

recently, significant progress has been made in identifying and characterizing fish genes related to the ifn system, including several type i ifn genes  <cit> , ifnγ  <cit>  and antiviral genes  <cit> . far less is known about the factors that are involved in ifn-signaling in fish, including the jak-stat pathway, although stat <dig> homologs have been cloned from several fish species  <cit> . additionally, a stat <dig> gene was recently identified in salmon  <cit> , and tyk <dig> and jak <dig> have been cloned from green pufferfish   <cit> .

in the present work we describe the identification and characterization of a stat <dig> gene from atlantic salmon. to get insight into the role of stat <dig> in response to cytokines and viruses in salmon we have studied the expression and activation of stat <dig> in primary leukocyte cultures and in different salmonid cell-lines upon type i and type ii ifn treatment and viral infections. the ability of stat <dig> to be phosphorylated and to translocate to the nucleus is critical for its role as a transcription factor. by employing a salmon stat <dig> antibody the localization of stat <dig> in different cells in response to ifn-treatment were studied. furthermore, stat <dig> phosphorylation was detected using a phosphotyrosine specific antibody after treatment with the same stimulants. such studies have not been performed in any teleost species earlier. both ifn-a <dig> and ifnγ treatment led to tyrosine phosphorylation and stat <dig> was also shown to be translocated to the nucleus after stimulation with ifn-a <dig> and ifnγ. we also show, using two different in vitro methods, that salmon stat <dig> is able to form dimers.

RESULTS
cloning of stat1
with primers derived from a rainbow trout  stat <dig> sequence we obtained a  <dig>  kb dna fragment by pcr using cdna from salmon ovaries and hk. sequencing of the cloned fragment revealed a  <dig>  <dig> base pairs long open reading frame which translated into an amino acid sequence with strong homology to the rainbow trout stat <dig> sequence . this salmon sequence was  <dig> amino acids longer than the rainbow trout sequence, and had a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. while preparing this manuscript two other stat <dig> sequences from atlantic salmon were submitted to the genbank database . these two sequences shared  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity, respectively, to our clone. our sequence was named ssstat1a . the major differences found between the three salmon sequences were located in the c-terminal end , where eu <dig> has two single nucleotide deletions when compared to ssstat1a , which leads to frame shifts and subsequently a premature stop. in bt <dig> is found an insertion of  <dig> nucleotides  in the c-terminus when compared to ssstat1a . pcr primers were designed in an attempt to pick up, and to distinguish between the ssstat1/eu <dig> and bt <dig> variants. the primer pair  would detect only the bt <dig> variant and give a pcr product of  <dig> nucleotides. however, using this strategy we were unable to amplify the bt <dig> variant in cdna from both stimulated and unstimulated salmon leukocytes .

the amino acid sequence of ssstat1a was compared to known stat <dig> sequences from other species  and revealed high homology, also with human and rat stat <dig> . the non-salmonid teleost species that was found to share the highest homology to salmon stat <dig> was snakehead  stat <dig> , whereas crucian carp  had the lowest identity of the compared species . in the presented phylogenetic tree ssstat1a is located in the same clade as other piscine stat <dig> sequences when high bootstrap values were applied .

the amino acid sequence of the ssstat1a clone contained several prototypic features and conserved domains crucial for stat <dig> functions . in the most c-terminal part of the sequence, the transcriptional activation domain , a conserved serine phosphorylation site was found in position  <dig> . this phosphorylation site is known to be crucial for the activation of transcription  <cit> . a conserved tyrosine residue was located in position  <dig> . phosphorylation of this tyrosine residue is crucial for activating the stat molecule and thereby enabling it to interact with the phosphotyrosine binding pocket located in the src homology  <dig>  domain of other stat molecules  <cit> . an analysis of this conserved domain  revealed that a phosphotyrosine binding pocket was located in sh <dig> of ssstat1a, where all four of the residues composing this feature was present, which of the conserved arginine at position  <dig> is believed to be the most crucial for forming h-bonds with phosphate oxygens of the phosphotyrosine side chain  <cit> . in addition residues important for dna-binding , nuclear import  and export   <cit>  were found to be conserved between mammalian and teleost stat <dig>  residues crucial for these functions are marked with asterisks in figure  <dig> 

tissue distribution of stat <dig> mrna
quantitative real-time pcr  was undertaken to examine expression of stat <dig> mrna in different salmon tissues. a uniform distribution of ssstat1a mrna was observed in all tissues tested, including head kidney, spleen, heart, gills and intestines, derived from  <dig> unvaccinated and healthy salmon controls .

induction and expression of stat <dig> protein in salmon primary cells
for detection of stat <dig> protein in salmon cells, a custom made peptide antibody was applied for western blotting. primary cells from salmon were subjected to western blotting upon stimulation with both type i and type ii ifn . in unstimulated adherent hk leukocytes   the stat <dig> protein was barely detectable, while the stat <dig> levels were increased upon both ifn-a <dig> and ifnγ stimulation, showing maximum levels at  <dig> h post stimulation. individual variations among the fish tested were observed, as exemplified in figure  <dig>  where increased stat <dig> levels upon stimulation were induced earlier in fish  <dig> compared to fish  <dig>  in splenocytes   a more even stat <dig> expression pattern was seen when comparing non-treated cells with the stimulated cells, indicating that stat <dig> expression levels in splenocytes were less affected by ifn treatment, but with a slight up-regulation after ifnγ stimulation. mx protein was detected on the same membranes after stripping and reprobing with an mx antibody. for hk leukocytes the relative increase in mx expression occurred earlier than the increase in stat <dig> expression, while the splenocytes showed a constitutive mx expression which paralleled the stat <dig> expression.

transcription levels of salmon stat <dig> mrna in salmon hk leukocytes
to determine whether the increase in stat <dig> protein expression upon type i and type ii ifn treatment of hk leukocytes were induced at transcriptional levels, the amount of mrna was measured at various times after stimulation, by real-time rt-pcr. a representative experiment is shown in figure  <dig>  both types of ifns induced stat <dig> expression levels slightly above unstimulated cells. in cells isolated from three fish, ifn-a <dig> caused an average increase in transcription of stat <dig> ranging from a 2-fold induction at  <dig> h through nearly 10-fold induction at  <dig> h and then a small decline at  <dig> h . the levels of stat <dig> transcripts after stimulation with ifnγ did barely change relative to the unstimulated control at the time points investigated, with a peak at 3-fold increase at  <dig> h . to verify the activity of the ifns used, the levels of mx transcripts were recorded in the same samples. at  <dig> h the mx transcripts were induced to a level  <dig> times above the unstimulated cells when ifn-a <dig> was added to the cells, whereas the ifnγ-induced transcription was 11-fold increased at the same time point .

stat <dig> protein expression levels in to and chse- <dig> cells upon ifn-treatment and viral infections
two salmonid cell-lines, to and chse- <dig> cells, known to be permissive for several viruses, were tested for expression of stat <dig> protein upon stimulation with different cytokines or virus. in unstimulated chse- <dig> cells expression of stat <dig> protein was barely detectable, while a modest induction upon ifn-a <dig> or ifnγ stimulation was found . infection with ipnv at moi of  <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h, did not increase protein expression above the level of uninfected cells . also infections with norwegian field isolates of highly virulent ipnv strains showed the same results . also induced stat <dig> levels were found in to cells after  <dig> h of exposure to ifn-a <dig> or ifnγ. however, neither infection with ipnv  nor isav  increased stat <dig> expression. mx protein was, however, induced after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of isav infection.

subcellular localization of stat1
the subcellular localization of stat <dig> after type i and ii ifn stimulation in salmon primary leukocytes and salmonid cell-lines was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. for this purpose cells were seeded on coverslips and stimulated for  <dig> h and  <dig> h with  <dig> u/ml ifn-a <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml of ifnγ. the cells were then fixed and immunostained for stat <dig> as described in the methods section. in all cell types studied, stat <dig>  localized exclusively to the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells . in primary cells from atlantic salmon hk, a relocalization of stat <dig> from the cytoplasm to the nucleus took place after stimulation with ifnγ for  <dig> h and stat <dig> was still retained in the nuclei at  <dig> h , although individual variations in the kinetics occurred among the  <dig> fish studied. in to cells the response to ifnγ seemed more transient than in the primary cells. at  <dig> h after ifnγ stimulation, some of the nuclei in the to cells had already been stained with stat <dig> and after  <dig> h stat <dig> had relocated to the cytoplasm . chse- <dig> cells did not respond to ifnγ with stat <dig> translocation at the time points studied . relocalization of stat <dig> after ifn-a <dig> stimulation was not observed by microscopy in any of the cell types at the time points chosen in this study. as a consequence of the inability of detecting stat <dig> in the nucleus by immunostaining and confocal laser scanning microscopy following ifn-a <dig> stimulation, nuclear extracts of ifn-a <dig> stimulated to cells were examined for the presence of stat <dig> . stat <dig> was detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with ifn-a <dig> for  <dig> or  <dig> min or ifnγ for  <dig> min, but also, to a lesser extent, in unstimulated cells. as a control for the separation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, an antibody directed against a strictly lysosomal protein, cathepsin d  was used as a control for cytoplasmic localization  <cit> .

salmon stat <dig> is phosphorylated upon ifn treatment
tyrosine phosphorylation is a key step in stat <dig> mediated ifn-signal transduction. to address whether the conserved tyrosine residue found in the salmon stat <dig> sequence is phosphorylated upon stimulation, an antibody specific to phosphorylated tyrosine was used. ifnγ-stimulated primary leukocytes were harvested and the stat <dig> antibody applied in order to immunoprecipitate stat <dig> molecules. the pulled-down material was subjected to sds-page and western blotting, and the membrane incubated with a tyrosine phospho-specific antibody. by ifnγ-stimulation phosphorylated stat <dig> was detected in adherent hk cells and splenocytes after both  <dig> h and  <dig> h , although cells from different individuals responded differently to this treatment . similarly, stat <dig> was phosphorylated upon stimulation with ifn-a <dig> at the same time-points . phosphorylation of stat <dig> was also confirmed in to cells . a time-course study in these cells showed that with ifnγ treatment stat <dig> was phosphorylated already after  <dig> min and peaked at  <dig> min, while in ifn-a <dig> treated cells a weak band was detected at  <dig> min, increased at  <dig> min and then remained relatively constant up to  <dig> min. after  <dig> min phosphorylation was regressing for both types of ifn. phosphorylated ectopically expressed ssstat1a was detected after  <dig> min by the tyrosine phospho-specific antibody . this experiment confirms that the cloned ssstat1a can be tyrosine phosphorylated upon ifn treatment, which is an important characteristic of this protein.

salmon stat <dig> homodimerisation
stat <dig> is known to form homodimers upon phosporylation  <cit> . however, dimerization of unphosphorylated stat <dig> in the cytoplasm is also reported  <cit>  by employing the yeast two-hybrid  system we were able to demonstrate a strong salmon stat1-stat <dig> interaction . interacting proteins were assessed by the ability of growth on complete medium deficient in histidine  or histidine and adenine . growth was recorded at day  <dig>  when the positive control expressing p <dig> fused to gal4dbd and sv <dig> t-antigen fused to gal4ad showed massive growth on qdo . the specificity of the interaction was tested with negative controls, and confirmed negative  by co-expressing the gal4ad-ssstat1a fusion protein both with gal4dbd alone and with gal4dbd fused to the human laminc protein, which is known to be a non-interacting protein  <cit> .

++++ strong interaction, - no interaction, qdo quadruple drop out medium, tdo triple dropout medium, nd not determined.

a co-ip analysis of over-expressed ssstat1a and ssstat1a-gfp fusion constructs in hek- <dig> cells verified the ssstat1a-ssstat1a interaction further. the western blot in figure  <dig> was probed with α-stat <dig> and showed expression of both ssstat1a and ssstat1a-gfp in the lysate . ssstat1a was co-precipitated along with ssstat1a-gfp when the gfp antibody was applied for the ip  and α-stat <dig> precipitated both ssstat1a and ssstat1a-gfp . as a negative control ssstat1a was co-transfected with the pexp-gfp vector. the gfp antibody did not precipitate ssstat1a  whereas α-stat <dig> did .

discussion
ifn induced immune responses in which stats are required are among the best understood signaling systems in mammals. although a number of proteins involved in the jak/stat signaling pathway have been cloned from fish, less is known about their function and whether the signaling resembles mammalian systems.

we have here cloned a cdna that corresponds to the salmon stat <dig> gene. a clustalw alignment confirmed that the cloned sequence was a stat <dig> homolog sharing extensive amino acid identity with other salmon stat <dig> isoforms and trout stat <dig> . the  <dig>  <dig> nucleotides open reading frame of the cloned cdna has a structural arrangement of functional motifs that is similar to mammalian stat <dig> suggesting that the salmon cdna encode a functional protein.

so far stat <dig> has been found in multiple fish species, including pufferfish, zebrafish , rainbow trout, atlantic salmon and japanese flounder . previous expression data, along with data presented here has revealed that piscine stat <dig> is widely expressed in many tissues  <cit> . however, data concerning functional activity in lower vertebrates, such as stat <dig> phosporylation and cellular localization upon stimulation of cells, is scarce. the presented data demonstrates for the first time that a teleost stat <dig> protein is being activated by ifns. salmon stat <dig> was shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated upon ifn-a <dig> and ifnγ stimulation of leukocytes, and additionally in to cells. also, relocalization of stat <dig> into the nucleus of leukocytes and to cells was observed following ifnγ stimulation. our data show a more evident response for ifnγ than for ifn-a <dig> when studying nuclear translocation of stat <dig> by microscopy. this was also consistent with the levels of phosphorylated stat <dig> observed upon the different ifn-stimulations where ifnγ consistently gave higher levels compared to ifn-a <dig>  stat <dig> is believed to be involved in both type i and type ii ifn signaling and their distinct responses could be due to unequal concentrations or activity of the cytokines used, or be dependent on differences in the kinetics of forming the complexes that enter the nuclei. we also showed that ssstat1a is able to form homodimers which is thought to be a prerequisite for entering the nucleus due to lack of a functional nuclear localization signal in its monomeric form  <cit> . in unstimulated cells stat proteins can exist as stable unphosphorylated dimers or monomers which are also shuttled over the nuclear membrane  <cit>  and are able to regulate gene expression in unconventional manners  <cit> , consistent with the observed presence of stat <dig> in nuclear extracts of unstimulated cells.

the to cell line is derived from salmon hk and it consists of heterogeneous cell types  <cit> . the chse- <dig> cells are embryo cells derived from chinook salmon   <cit> . both these cell lines are widely used as experimental systems to study immune responses in salmon  <cit> . according to our results, the expression of stat <dig> protein seems to be up-regulated upon type i and type ii ifn treatment in both the cell lines and also in primary hk leukocytes. while the presented western data are not quantitative, we provide qpcr data showing that type i ifn induce stat <dig> expression in hk leukocytes to a greater extent  than type ii ifn , and also by different kinetics, where the response to type ii ifn peaked at an earlier time-point. unlike the hk leukocytes, the splenocytes, which are mostly lymphoid-like cells, did not show increased abundance of stat <dig> upon ifn-stimulation. the up-regulation of salmon stat <dig> transcripts after ifn-a <dig> stimulation of to cells is reported by others  <cit> , additionally the type i ifn inducer poly  has been shown to induce stat <dig> mrna expression in rtg-cells  <cit> .

following encounter with viral pathogens, chse- <dig> and to cells did not seem to boost the levels of stat <dig> protein, but stayed relatively constant. mx-protein was induced 24- <dig> h after infection with isav, but did not respond to ipnv infection, which is in compliance with results reported earlier  <cit> . the uniform expression patterns in salmon tissues and in different cell-types treated in various ways indicate that it is likely that stats are present in the cytoplasm in most resting tissues, alert and ready to be activated upon cellular receptor signaling. the signal transduction and activation of isgs may lead to a feedback loop that amplifies ifn-responses and induces stat <dig> in a secondary manner, stat <dig> itself being an isg. this is shown in human cells-lines where ifnγ-induced irf- <dig> in concert with creb binding protein acts as key up-regulator of stat <dig> mrna transcription by binding to a combined irf-e/gas element in the stat <dig> promoter  <cit> . mutual regulation of stat <dig> and irf- <dig> indicates an intracellular amplifying circuit in response to ifn.

the stat <dig> complexes formed in response to type i ifn in salmonid cells are presumably, like in mammals, distinct from those formed in response to type ii ifn. masking of the epitope for the stat <dig> antibody after responding to ifn1a is a plausible explanation to the inability to detect nuclear stat <dig> by confocal microscopy examination upon ifn-a <dig> stimulation. under the denaturing conditions of sds-page and western blotting stat <dig> was detected in the nucleus of to cells after treatment with ifn-a <dig>  also a small portion of stat <dig> was detected in nuclear extracts of unstimulated cells, which is consistent with observations of stat <dig> as a constitutive transcriptional regulator in mammalian systems  <cit> . unlike to cells and primary leukocytes, no relocalization of stat <dig> from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was found upon ifnγ treatment of chse- <dig> cells. this could be due to the apparent low levels of endogenously expressed stat <dig> protein in these cells. however, the expression levels were evaluated by western blotting and the low detectable levels may be due to a lower affinity of the stat <dig> antibody to chinook salmon stat <dig>  nevertheless, the levels of stat <dig> in chse- <dig> were induced by both types of ifn, but considerably later  than the time points used for the confocal microscopy examination. no nuclear extracts were made in order to examine stat <dig> expression in these cells. the presence of the ifn receptors  in the different cell-lines is also uncertain although a putative ifnγ-receptor was recently identified in rainbow trout  <cit> . the differences in response endorse the assumption that there are distinct proteins involved in signaling from type i and type ii ifns. the presence of a stat <dig> gene in salmon was recently reported  <cit> , and the first teleost importin alpha gene was recently cloned from red seabream   <cit> , both findings adding to the assumption that ifn signaling in fish resembles that of mammals.

unlike the  action of human ifnγ  <cit> , ifnγ in salmonids up-regulates mx expression  <cit> . this might be a consequence of indirect stimulation, as fish ifnγ can activate type i ifn  <cit>  . interestingly, recombinant ifnγ activates an isre-containing reporter-construct in a dose dependent manner whereas constructs containing only gas elements give no response to either type of ifns as shown by castro et al.  <cit> . this finding suggests that cross-talk between ifn signaling pathways occurs in fish. overlapping effects of type i and ii ifns are also described in mammals  <cit>  in the absence of exogenously administered ifns, over-expression of ssstat1a by transfection in to cells activated the mx-promoter at a very moderate level . furthermore over-expression of ssstat1a gave no additionally increased mx-promoter activity upon type i or ii ifn supplement. this is probably due to lack of stoichiometric balance of factors that activate, or interact with, the over-expressed stat <dig> molecules. similar results are observed in mammalian cells with a slightly different ifnγ-responsive reporter  <cit> .

naturally occurring truncated forms of stats can act as competitors of functional stats and inhibit transcriptional activation  <cit> . the ssstat1a gene differs from two other salmon stat1s published in genbank. the presence of more than one stat <dig> isotype in salmon implies distinct functions for the different stat1s, possibly at the level of transcription activation as the main differences are located in the tad. the presented ssstat1a is longer than eu <dig>   <cit>  while shorter than bt <dig>  our attempt to detect both ssstat1a and bt <dig> transcripts in salmon primary cells failed, and only ssstat1a was detected independent of the type of treatment the cells were subjected to. other cell-types, signals or cellular conditions might favor bt <dig> expression.

CONCLUSIONS
we have cloned a salmon stat <dig> isoform possessing conserved structural domains. expressional and functional studies of this gene suggest that salmon use the specialized jak/stat pathway for cytokine signaling as stat <dig> is tyrosine phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus upon ifn stimulation. further details related to jak/stat signaling and viral infections of this economically important fish needs to be elucidated. the ability of ipnv to impair stat <dig> activation/phosphorylation is currently being examined, and the interacting ability of activated stat <dig> needs to be addressed.
