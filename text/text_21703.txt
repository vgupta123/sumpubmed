BACKGROUND
mosquitoes transmit many infectious diseases, including malaria, lymphatic filariasis, yellow fever, and dengue. among these diseases, malaria is by far the most costly in terms of human health. it is endemic to more than  <dig> countries and causes  <dig> million cases per year, with the highest mortality in children from sub-saharan africa. malaria transmission to humans requires a competent mosquito species, as plasmodium parasites must undergo a complex developmental cycle and survive the defense responses of their insect host. in africa, anopheles gambiae is the major vector of plasmodium falciparum infection, which causes the most aggressive form of human malaria.

the plasmodium berghei  model is one of the most widely used experimental systems to study malaria transmission. gene silencing by systemic injection of double-stranded rna  has proven to be a very useful tool to carry out functional genomic screens aimed at identifying mosquito genes that mediate anti-parasitic responses. in general, anopheles gambiae is considered to be susceptible to p. berghei infection, because a high prevalence of infection can be achieved and parasites are only rarely melanized; however, silencing of either thioester-containing protein  <dig>   <cit> , leucine-rich repeat immune protein  <dig>   <cit> , or lrim <dig> , enhances p. berghei infection by 4â€“ <dig> fold; indicating that, when these effector molecules are present, about 80% of parasites are eliminated by a lytic mechanism <cit> . it is well documented that an. gambiae mosquitoes have a different transcriptional response to infection with p. berghei and p. falciparum  <cit>  and genes such as lrim <dig> and c-type lectin  <dig>   <cit> , which limit or enhance p. berghei infection, respectively, do not affect p. falciparum infection in an. gambiae  <cit> . this raises the possibility that some antiplasmodial genes identified using the p. berghei malaria model may not be relevant to human malaria transmission.

more than  <dig> species of anopheline mosquitoes have been identified, but only  <dig> of them are considered to be important disease vectors  <cit> . different anopheline species and even particular strains of mosquitoes vary widely in their susceptibility to infection with a given plasmodium parasite species. for example, twelve different strains of anopheles stephensi have been shown to have very different susceptibility to p. falciparum  infection  <cit> . furthermore, susceptibility had a strong genetic component, which allowed selection of a an. stephensi strain  that is highly susceptible to p. falciparum infection  <cit> . a strain of an. gambiae  was selected to be highly refractory to infection with plasmodium cynomolgy . the l <dig> strain melanizes p. cynomolgy, as well as several other plasmodium species such as p. berghei , plasmodium gallinaceum , and other primate malaria parasites such as plasmodium gonderi, plasmodium inui, and plasmodium knowlesi. interestingly, p. falciparum strains from the new world are also melanized effectively, but not those of african origin, suggesting that there are genetic differences between p. falciparum strains that affect their ability to infect an. gambiae  <cit> . the african strains of p. falciparum tested appeared to be better adapted to their natural mosquito vector. however, great differences in the level of resistance to p. falciparum infection have been documented in families derived from individual an. gambiae females collected in the field  <cit> , and a small region of chromosome 2l is a major determinant of genetic resistance to infection  <cit> .

drosophila melanogaster can support the development of plasmodium gallinaceum oocysts when cultured ookinetes are injected into the hemocele  <cit> . this observation opened the possibility of using a genetic approach to screen for drosophila genes that affect plasmodium p. gallinaceum infection <cit> . furthermore, silencing of orthologs  of five of these candidate genes in an. gambiae  demonstrated that four of them also affected p. berghei infection in the mosquito  <cit> .

in this study we compare how silencing a set of genes identified in the drosophila screen affects plasmodium infection in different vector-parasite combinations. we conclude that there is a broad range of compatibility between different plasmodium strains and particular mosquito strains that is determined by the interaction between the parasite and the mosquito's immune system. we define compatibility as the extent to which the immune system of the mosquito is actively limiting plasmodium infection. for example, the p. yoelii-an. stephensi and p. falciparum-an. gambiae strains used in this study are highly compatible vector-parasite combinations, as silencing several genes involved in oxidative response or immunity has no significant effect on infection. in contrast, silencing the same genes has a strong effect in less compatible vector-parasite combinations such as p. yoelii-an. gambiae or p. berghei-an. gambiae.

RESULTS
effect of gstt <dig> and gstt <dig> silencing on p. berghei infection
the effect of silencing an. gambiae orthologs  of genes originally identified in the drosophila genetic screen on p. berghei infectivity is summarized in table  <dig> <cit> . knockdown of arginine kinase  and oxidation resistance gene  <dig>  reduces infection. tetraspanin and heat-shock cognate  <dig>  silencing have the opposite effect, enhancing infection, while reducing the expression of the solute transporter  gene did not affect infection with p. berghei  <cit> . the effect of silencing two an. gambiae homologs of a glutathione s-transferase of the theta class   gene also identified in the drosophila screen on p. berghei infection was evaluated. injection of gstt <dig>  or gstt <dig>  dsrna reduced mrna expression by 60% and 55%, respectively, relative to the control groups injected with dslacz. both gstt <dig> and gstt <dig> knockdown significantly reduce p. berghei infection  using the kolmogorov-smirnov  test .

direct comparison of the effect of silencing seven an. gambiae genes on p. berghei and p. falciparum infection
the effect of reducing expression of the five genes previously reported  <cit>  as well as gstt <dig> and gstt <dig> in an. gambiae infected with p. falciparum  was evaluated . silencing of argk and hsc- <dig> significantly reduced infection  . sol. trsp., gstt <dig>  and oxr <dig> silencing did not affect p. falciparum infection , while tetraspanin and gstt <dig> knockdown enhanced infection  . a summary of these results is shown in table  <dig> 

silencing argk, sol. trsp., and tetraspanin genes has a similar effect on p. berghei and p. falciparum infection. argk is a key enzyme in cellular energy homeostasis in arthropods, with a function similar to that of creatine kinase in mammals. this enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of phosphoarginine, which serves as an energy reserve. the high-energy phosphate in phosphoarginine can be transferred to adp to renew atp during periods of high energy demand  <cit> . apparently, silencing this enzyme results in a physiologic state in the mosquito that does not foster the development of either p. berghei or p. falciparum. silencing of the solute transporter has no effect, while knockdown of tetraspanin enhances infection with both parasites. tetraspanins are proteins with four transmembrane  domains that are associated extensively with one another and with other membrane proteins to form specific microdomains distinct from lipid rafts. they are expressed on the surface of numerous cell types and are involved in diverse processes from cell adhesion to signal transduction and some of them inhibit the function of other members of the same family of proteins  <cit> . cd <dig> is a tetraspanin that has been shown to be required for hepatocyte invasion by p. falciparum and p. yoelii sporozoites  <cit> . silencing of the an. gambiae tetraspanin gene may enhance parasite invasion and/or prevent the activation of an immune cascade that limits infection with p. berghei and p. falciparum.

oxr <dig>  gstt <dig>  gstt <dig> and hsc- <dig> silencing has a different effect on p. berghei and p. falciparum infection. in yeast and mammals, oxr <dig> is induced by heat and oxidative stress and prevents oxidative damage by an unknown mechanism  <cit> . in an. gambiae, oxr <dig> silencing decreases resistance to oxidative challenge and prevents the induction of genes involved in ros detoxification, such as catalase, following a blood meal . we have previously shown that higher ros levels in an. gambiae reduce p. berghei infection  <cit> . thus, it is likely that the decrease in p. berghei infectivity following oxr <dig> silencing is due to an increase in ros. the unexpected observation that oxr <dig> silencing does not affect p. falciparum infection suggests that either this parasite species is less susceptible to oxidative stress or that the ingestion of human blood results in less accumulation of ros in the mosquito.

gsts play an important role as antioxidants and are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics. gsts of the epsilon and delta class have been extensively studied for their role in insecticide resistance in mosquitoes  <cit> . the gst-theta <dig>  null genotype in human males is highly associated to increased risk of basal cell carcinoma of the skin  <cit> . furthermore, in diabetics, the deletion of one copy of the gstt <dig> gene is associated with elevated markers of inflammation and lipid peroxidation  <cit> . therefore, silencing of gstt <dig> and gstt <dig> could result in increased lipid peroxidation, which is expected to be deleterious to p. berghei; however, it is not clear why reducing gstt <dig> expression enhances p. falciparum infection.

susceptibility of an. stephensi  and an. gambiae  to p. yoelii infection
the observed differences in the effect of silencing specific an. gambiae  genes on p. berghei and p. falciparum infection may reflect the degree of compatibility between these two parasite species and the mosquito strain used. alternatively, mosquitoes may trigger different sets of effector genes in response to different plasmodium species. to explore these possibilities, we evaluated the responses of two mosquito species that differ in their susceptibility to the same plasmodium parasite.

the susceptibility of an. stephensi , a strain highly susceptible to p. falciparum infection  <cit> , and an. gambiae  females to p. yoelii infection was compared by feeding them on the same infected mouse. an. stephensi is highly susceptible to p. yoelii infection, as no melanized parasites are observed and the median number of live oocysts is 51-fold higher than in an. gambiae . in contrast, an. gambiae  is partially refractory and has two distinct phenotypes . in approximately half of the mosquitoes, all parasites are melanized, while in the other half, parasite lysis appears to be the main defense response, as no melanizations are observed . interestingly, the prevalence of mixed phenotypesâ€“that is, mosquitoes in which both live and melanized parasites are observedâ€“is low . these results are in agreement with a previous report in which susceptibility of an. gambiae  and an. stephensi  to p. yoelii infection was compared  <cit> .

an. gambiae
an. stephensi
effect of silencing an. stephensi orthologs on p. yoelii infection
six genes whose phenotypes differ when an. gambiae is infected with p. berghei or p. falciparum were examined. an. stephensi orthologs of oxr <dig>  hsc- <dig>  gstt <dig>  and gstt <dig>  as well as two other genes previously reported in the literature , were silenced, and the effect on p. yoelii infection was evaluated. five of the six genes tested had similar effects in the an. gambiae-p. falciparum and the an. stephensi-p. yoelii systems . silencing oxr <dig>  lrim <dig>  ctl <dig>  or gstt <dig> had no effect, while gstt <dig> and hsc- <dig> silencing enhanced p. yoelii infection in an. stephensi . hsc- <dig> was the only gene that gave a different phenotype between an. gambiae-p. falciparum and an. stephensi-p. yoelii. conversely, this was also the only gene that had a similar phenotype in an. gambiae infected with p. berghei and in p. yoelii-infected an. stephensi. the expression of heat shock proteins is temperature dependent; thus the differences in the effect of hsc- <dig> silencing in mosquitoes infected with different plasmodium species could be due to physiologic differences resulting from the temperature at which infected mosquitoes are kept. for example, hsc- <dig> silencing decreases p. falciparum infection  in an. gambiae but results in a significant but mild increase in p. yoelii infection  in an. stephensi and a strong enhancement of p. berghei infection  in an. gambiae. interestingly, a decrease in parasite number is also observed in the drosophila line in which a p-element has been inserted close to the hsc- <dig> gene. in the fly system, in vitro cultured p. gallinaceum ookinetes are injected into the hemocele and the infected flies kept at 27Â°c  <cit> . it appears that silencing hsc- <dig> decreases plasmodium infection when the infected insects are kept at a higher temperature but has the opposite effect, enhancing infection, when infected insects are kept at a lower temperature.

refractoriness of an. gambiae  to p. yoelii infection is due to activation of the mosquito immune system
the fact that lrim <dig> and ctl <dig> silencing in an. stephensi  had no effect on p. yoelii infection could reflect a lack of activation of the immune system in this highly susceptible mosquito strain. alternatively, it is also possible that lrim <dig> and ctl <dig> do not participate in mosquito antiparasitic responses to p. yoelii. to explore these two possibilities, the effect of ctl <dig> and lrim <dig> silencing in an. gambiae  females, which are partially refractory to p. yoelii infection, was investigated. ctl <dig> silencing increases the number of melanized parasites from 62% to 95% . conversely, lrim <dig> silencing completely reverts p. yoelii melanization and increases the median number of live oocysts by  <dig>  fold . to further investigate the participation of the an. gambiae immune system on the partial refractoriness of this species to p. yoelii infection, the effect of silencing tep <dig> and lrim <dig> was also evaluated. tep <dig> and lrim <dig> had a similar effect as lrim <dig>  enhancing infection by  <dig> and  <dig>  fold, respectively .

CONCLUSIONS
the effect of silencing multiple mosquito genes in the highly compatible p. yoelii -an. stephensi system was very similar to that observed when p. falciparum  was used to infect an. gambiae , its natural vector; suggesting that p. yoelii-an. stephensi is a representative animal model to study p. falciparum interactions with compatible vectors. furthermore, p. yoelii-infected females can be kept at 24Â°c, a temperature that is more physiological for mosquitoes and closer to that used for p. falciparum infections .

using less compatible parasite-mosquito combinations, such as the p. berghei-an. gambiae or p. yoelii-an. gambiae strains described in this study, may be particularly useful to identify and characterize immune pathways in the mosquito that could potentially limit human malaria transmission. once a potential pathway is defined, it is possible to investigate if certain parasite strains avoid activating them, or if the effector genes are inefficient. it may also be possible to use alternative strategies  to activate these potential antiplasmodial responses and test their effectiveness in limiting malaria transmission in natural vector-parasite combinations.

there is a broad spectrum of compatibility between different strains of plasmodium and particular mosquito strains; for example, an. gambiae  is highly compatible with p. falciparum  parasites, but has low compatibility with p. yoelii 17xnl. a given strain of plasmodium can also be more compatible with certain mosquitoes. for example, p. yoelii 17xnl is much more compatible with an. stephensi  than with an. gambiae . tep <dig> silencing in an. gambiae  mosquitoes enhances infection with p. falciparum , doubling the median number of oocysts  <cit> . silencing tep <dig> in an. gambiae has a more dramatic effect  on p. berghei infection  <cit> . furthermore, silencing tep <dig> in an. gambiae  does not enhance infection with p. falciparum , indicating that there are differences in compatibility between particular strains of an. gambiae and p. falciparum .

over activation of the rel <dig> pathway by silencing caspar, a critical suppressor of this cascade, drastically reduces p. falciparum  infection in an. gambiae , an. albimanus  and an. stephensi mosquitoes  <cit> . double silencing experiments in an. gambiae  females, in which caspar and tep <dig>  were co-silenced, rescues the effect of caspar, indicating that tep <dig> is an important effector of this response. the fact that strong activation of the rel <dig> pathway can very effectively prevent infection in several mosquito species that are natural vectors of p. falciparum  <cit> , begs the question of why this immune response is not effective preventing disease transmission under natural field conditions.

it has been proposed that p. falciparum parasites have evolved specific mechanisms to modulate activation of the an. gambiae immune system as they adapted to their natural mosquito vector  <cit> . the observation that p. falciparum strains from the new world, such as the brazilian p. falciparum 7g <dig> strain, are melanized very effectively by the an. gambiae l <dig> strain but not those of african origin  <cit>  adds support to the adaptation hypothesis. recent experiments revealed that lrim <dig> can also mediate immune responses against p. falciparum, because silencing this gene in an. gambiae l <dig> females infected with the brazilian p. falciparum 7g <dig> strain completely reverts the melanization phenotype and results in live oocysts . selection for refractoriness to p. cynomolgy resulted in a strain of an. gambiae that is also refractory to multiple plasmodium species. lrim <dig> also mediates the antiparasitic responses of anopheles quadriannulatus to p. berghei infection  <cit> . these findings indicate that some genes, such as tep1/lrim <dig>  are broad mediators of antiparasitic responses against several different plasmodium parasites in different mosquito strains.

under natural conditions, p. falciparum parasites must avoid or withstand the antiparasitic responses of an. gambiae to complete their life cycle and this is likely to exert selective pressure on parasite populations. for example, in southern mexico, three genetically distinct p. vivax populations have been identified, and experimental infections indicate that parasites are most compatible with sympatric mosquito species  <cit> . the authors propose that reciprocal selection between malaria parasites and mosquito vectors has led to local adaptation of parasites to their vectors  <cit> . thus, it is likely that in well-adapted systems there is some level of immune evasion and/or suppression, and this could explain why silencing some genes involved in immunity  or oxidative stress  in an. gambiae  females, has little effect on p. falciparum  infection.

there is also increasing evidence from many different studies that the interaction between plasmodium parasites and the mosquito immune system it is a strong determinant of vectorial capacity. nevertheless, the extent to which the mosquito immune system is effectively reducing plasmodium infection is very variable, even between particular parasite and mosquito strains. these differences in compatibility need to be evaluated and carefully considered when selecting an experimental animal model to study malaria transmission.
