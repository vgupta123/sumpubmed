BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk of peptic ulcers and gastric adenocarcinoma of the human stomach  <cit> . h. pylori adherence to the gastric epithelium and deliver effectors to induce inflammation  <cit> . one of the best-studied adhesins is the blood group antigen binding adhesin , which binds lewis b  and related abo antigens  <cit> . putative adhesin, babb, is encoded by babb, which shares nearly identical n- and c-terminal sequences with baba <cit> . the reversed chromosomal locations of baba and babb between strain j <dig> and  <dig> prove the recombination events between these two genes  <cit> . the two genes also show both geographic and allelic variation  <cit> . moreover, the duplication of baba or babb gene is mediated by gene conversion between the different chromosomal loci  <cit> . bäckström et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the silent baba gene of a leb-nonbinding strain can be activated by recombination into the babb gene. the rhesus monkey model showed that most recovered isolates have replaced baba with a second copy of babb after several weeks of infection  <cit> .

in western countries, patients infected with baba-positive h. pylori isolates are associated with an increased risk of peptic ulcer diseases  <cit> . however, this association is not confirmed in patients from the eastern asia, or some other western countries  <cit> . colbeck et al.  <cit>  used pcr to detect whether the downstream of hpyd  and s <dig>  are baba or babb and found single-colony isolate with mixed baba and babb genotype at the same locus, indicating subpopulations within the bacterial population derived from a single colony. it is worthy to answer whether the genetic profiles of baba and babb could be related to the different clinical disease outcomes or the specific h. pylori-related histological features.

there are different predominant cell types in the antrum and corpus. the parietal cells producing hcl locate in the corpus and make a different ph gradient to the antrum. our previous study showed patients with chronic h. pylori infection expressed a higher intensity of lewis b in the gastric epithelium of corpus than in the antrum  <cit> . recombination between baba and babb might help h. pylori to change its adhesion ability to adapt different niches within the stomach  <cit> . accordingly, it is worthy to determine the genotype distribution of baba and babb in the h. pylori infection over the different topographic locations as either antrum or corpus in human stomach. in this study, we analyzed the clinical significance of baba and babb genotypes and the presence of baba and babb at locus a and b of multiple colonies from different gastric niches to understand the babab genetic profile of h. pylori isolates across gastric regions within the same host.

RESULTS
distributions of baba and babb genotypes in patients with different clinical diseases
detection of babab genotypes was based on the primer design shown in figure  <dig>  among  <dig> strains, the distribution of the four genotypes  was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. there was no difference in the gender distribution among the different genotypes . the mean age of patients infected with genotype as ab ab was marginally older than those infected with other genotypes . the distributions of the four genotypes were significantly different in the patients with different clinical diseases . the mean age of gc patients was higher than the other non-cancer patients . the rate of the ab ab genotype in the patients with gc was higher than that in the three groups of non-cancer patients .

du: duodenal ulcer. gu: gastric ulcer. gc: gastric cancer. the difference between the four genotypes in gastric diseases was assessed by the chi-square test.

as the ab ab genotype was higher in the patients with gastric cancer, we further tested whether such a genotype may lead to a higher rate of precancerous changes or more severe histological inflammation. in the patients with gc, the ab ab genotype was associated with a higher intensity of intestinal metaplasia  in the antrum compared to non-ab ab genotype . however, in the non-cancer patients, the ab ab genotype wasn’t associated with higher acute inflammation scores , chronic inflammation scores , h. pylori density , or the intensity of im  compared to non-ab ab genotype.

difference in the baba and babb genotype between isolates from antrum and corpus
for the  <dig> patients who provided isolates from different gastric niches over the antrum and corpus, the genotype composition of baba and babb at locus a and b of their antrum and corpus isolates is shown in table  <dig>  four patients  were infected with an a b genotype strain across the antrum and corpus, and  <dig> patients were found to have a mixed genotype strains  in only the corpus, or both gastric niches. in those  <dig> patients,  <dig> patients  had the same mixed genotypes across the antrum and corpus. eight of remaining  <dig> patients had one major genotype across both gastric niches. combining with the  <dig> patients  with only one genotype,  <dig> %  of our patients had one major genotype distributed across two niches.

patient no.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  who were infected by  <dig> genotypes, still have a major one across both gastric niches, and that was also true in  <dig>  patients having  <dig>  and  <dig>  patient having  <dig> genotypes represented in their infections. - indicating that the patients have non-dominant baba and babb genotype in the isolates of antrum or corpus. the patients’ number was according to our previous study  <cit> .

among those  <dig> patients infected with more than one genotype , the frequency of the major dominant genotype, a b combined with ab ab, in the antrum was higher compared with that in the corpus . however,  <dig> of  <dig> patients lacked a dominant genotype in their corpus isolates.

sequence analysis and comparison
at locus a, each patient’s antrum and corpus isolates had specific substitutions of amino acids in the region of baba . however, there was no obvious difference between the antrum and corpus isolates in the sequencing region, except from patient no.  <dig> . we also found  <dig> different nonsynonymous substitutions at amino acid  <dig> in  <dig> patients’ isolates, as compared with strain j <dig>  the same scenario  was in the babb sequences.

ct repeats of baba and babb at locus b
genes at locus b are regulated by ct repeats in the 5’ coding region, and the number of ct repeats  make in-frame protein expression possible  <cit> . the ct repeats of the babb gene at locus b are shown in table  <dig>  the corpus isolates in  <dig> of  <dig> patients had a change of ct repeats of the babb gene at locus b, and antrum isolates of those patients always have the same ct repeats, except patient  <dig> .

four patients  were infected by isolates with one kind of ct repeat  across the antrum and corpus, but only one of them  had an out of frame babb. in the other patients , their antrum isolates contained  <dig> ct repeats but the corpus isolates changed to  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> repeats. for the patients  who were infected by the antrum isolates with  <dig> or  <dig> ct repeats, their corpus isolates also had a change of ct repeats, but the number of ct repeats was still out of frame , except in one isolate from patient no.  <dig> .

genotype and baba expression
to determine the effect of baba at locus a and b on baba expression , we found that the baba at locus b didn’t obviously affect the level of baba expression, when compared to the isolates 19c <dig>  and 19c <dig> . all the isolates  had the a ab genotype, but the ct repeats of the baba at locus b of c <dig> was out of frame. the expression of baba was not affected by whether baba at locus b was in or out of frame. we further determined whether a mixed genotype at locus a would affect baba expression, and found 14c <dig> and 14c <dig> with the ab b genotype  had slightly lower expression than 14a <dig> and 14a <dig> with the a b genotype . ab ab genotype also had the lower baba expression than a b .

discussion
the occurrence of intragenomic recombination between baba and babb has been demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo experiments, implicating this mechanism may possibly assist h. pylori to adapt in the human stomach  <cit> . in addition, mixed genotypes of baba and babb at locus a or b have been demonstrated  <cit> . the clinical association of the baba and babb genotype of h. pylori strains and genetic profile with infections of the antrum and corpus of a single host are still unclear. in this study, we demonstrated that the ab ab genotype, one dominant genotype in the antrum, was associated with the precancerous lesion as im, and correlated with gastric cancer. however, h. pylori infection by such ab ab genotype has not lead into a more dense colonization or inflammation severity in gastric histology. our data indicate h. pylori baba and babb genotypes as ab ab should at least exert with better adaptation to gastric environment during carcinogenesis.

colbeck et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> genotypes  in their study. nevertheless, our study only found four genotypes  in the  <dig> isolates from  <dig> patients’ antrum and corpus . it indicates the genotype diversity of babab in taiwanese isolates could be obviously less complicate. moreover, at least one baba gene at locus a existed in each of the isolates. this finding is compatible with our previous report to reveal the taiwanese h. pylori isolates are nearly 100% baba-positive  <cit> , and support the higher prevalence of baba in h. pylori strains from east asian countries than those from western worlds  <cit> . moreover, matteo et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that  <dig> of  <dig> patients  had bab gene variation across the antrum and corpus of a single host at a specific time point. we found that  <dig> of  <dig> patients  infected by more than one genotype in either one or both gastric niches. the prevalence discrepancy between two studies could be due to the analysis of bab genotype from the bacterial pool or single-colony isolate.

analysis of the sequences of baba and babb revealed that nonsynonymous substitutions of amino acids occurred between the individual strains , but did not differ between the gastric niches. pride et al.  <cit>  also showed high allelic diversity within baba and babb in the strains from different patients. judging by the  <dig> different nonsynonymous substitutions of amino acid  <dig> in the  <dig> patients’ strains, that codon was a highly variable site. this is worth further investigation, as it may be a special site responsible for adapting to differences in individual stomachs.

ct repeats in the 5’ coding region of baba and babb are more commonly found at locus b than locus a  <cit> . we found that the corpus isolates had a higher frequency of changes in number of ct repeats of babb at locus b than the antrum isolates . among those  <dig> patients infected by the corpus isolates with a change of ct repeats, only one  had the isolate changing ct repeats to in-frame  . this data indicates that babb expression could be tightly controlled by phase variation due to out of frame repeats in the corpus. among  <dig> patients infected by isolates with more than one genotype, their isolates from antrum have a higher rate of a b and ab ab as dominant genotypes than corpus . moreover, half of those patients lacked a dominant genotype in their corpus isolates. these results suggest the environment in the corpus may favor different adaptation for the isolates with different h. pylori genetic diversities.

the presence of the ab ab genotype was higher in gc patients with older age . in addition, the ab ab genotype is not correlated with more severe inflammation or precancerous changes in the non-cancer patients. based on this cross-sectional clinical histological data, it suggests the ab ab strains may have a better adaptation to the cancerous environment in stomach, instead of leading into more toxicity in gastric carcinogenesis. in figure 3a, we show that the baba gene at locus a dominantly determines baba expression, and the mixed genotype as ab at locus a may decrease the baba expression . it is thus possible a mixed genotype as ab at locus a may make h. pylori isolates to contain a subpopulation losing baba expression. alternatively, the mixed genotype as ab at locus b may possibly allow h. pylori to change babb expression and thus deserves further study.

in addition, our previous data have shown that the intensity of lewis b become decreased in antrum atrophy, but can be preserved in corpus to mediate higher colonization of bug overthere  <cit> . so, it shall be also implicative to test whether the ab ab genotype dominantly in antrum can have advantage to adapt the gastric epithelium with weak lewis b expression in future.

CONCLUSIONS
the h. pylori isolate with baba and babb genotype as ab ab genotype correlates with an increased gastric cancer risk, and colonize in an antrum predominant manner. such ab ab genotype shall be associated with a better adaptation to the gastric precancerous or cancer environment, and possibly generate subpopulations losing baba or babb.
