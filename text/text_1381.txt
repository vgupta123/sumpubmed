BACKGROUND
downy mildew caused by the oomycete plasmopara halstedii  berlese & de toni is responsible for significant yield losses during sunflower cultivation. interspecific hybridization between helianthus species is an important tool to expand the genetic variability of cultivated sunflower and to extend the genetic basis of disease resistance in breeding material  <cit> . the downy mildew resistance locus plarg was introgressed from the wild species h. argophyllus into cultivated sunflower  <cit> . since it mediates resistance to all known races of p. halstedii, plarg is a valuable source for broad-spectrum resistance against the pathogen. recently, we have fine-mapped the plarg locus on linkage group  <dig>  of sunflower  <cit> , but the ultimate goal is the positional cloning of the resistance gene or gene cluster underlying plarg. for this purpose, we devised a strategy for the enrichment of that region with markers by focusing on a subset of sequences with homology to known plant resistance genes. the identification of resistance gene-like sequences located in the target interval thus serves as proof-of-concept for the employed enrichment strategy and provides candidate sequences for the resistance gene plarg.

the approach used for marker enrichment in non-model organisms generally depends on the availability of genomic information. to date no reference sequence is available for sunflower. whole genome sequencing and the establishment of a reference sequence of h. annuus is advancing rapidly, however, due to its genome size of about  <dig>  gb and its highly repetitive nature sequencing the sunflower genome is a time- and cost-intensive enterprise even with ngs technologies  <cit> . for identification of candidate genes derived from interspecific crosses it remains to be shown how informative this sequence information will be. in case of plarg, a large chromosome segment from h. argophyllus was introgressed into lg <dig> of h. annuus, but as for many other crop species, no reference sequences will be available for the wild relatives of sunflower in the near future. thus, for the detection of candidate genes a sequence by sequence comparison will not be possible. in addition, the alien genome introgression was accompanied by suppressed recombination around plarg that was reflected by the clustering of ssr markers on lg <dig>  <cit> . therefore, extremely large mapping populations are required to recover informative crossovers in the target region necessary for constructing high-resolution genetic maps.

as an efficient method for the rapid identification of molecular markers linked to any specific gene or genomic region, michelmore et al. <cit>  developed bulked segregant analysis . the idea of bsa is to establish two phenotypically contrasting bulked samples that contain individuals of a population segregating for the gene of interest. the individuals within one bulk carry the same allele for one particular gene or genomic region surrounding the gene of interest, but carry arbitrary alleles at all unlinked regions. similar to near-isogenic lines, bsa can efficiently be used for marker enrichment in a target region  <cit> .

ngs technologies have been used for a wide range of plant genomic applications such as genome sequencing in cucumber  <cit> , de novo sequencing of bacs in barley  <cit> , whole-genome sequence variation studies on a. thaliana accessions  <cit>  and transcriptome sequencing for snp discovery in rye  <cit> . applying high-throughput sequencing to bsa in yeast as a species with a rather small genome, wenger et al. discovered a xylitol dehydrogenase gene responsible for xylose utilization  <cit> . recently, trick et al. reported the successful combination of bsa and illumina rnaseq technology for fine-mapping of the previously cloned grain protein content gene gpc-b <dig> in tetraploid wheat. the snp discovery was realized by aligning individual reads against a ncbi wheat transcriptome reference comprising  <dig>  unigene sequences  <cit> .

here, we describe a procedure for marker enrichment and candidate gene identification that uses ngs in combination with a bulked segregant transcriptome analysis  approach. as only a small percentage of the genome constitutes the transcriptome, deep sequencing of cdna libraries provides an attractive approach to obtain sufficient sequence coverage needed for de novo assembly and for discovery of snp markers. main objectives of this study were to 1) develop a snp detection pipeline integrating bulked segregant analysis with de novo transcriptome assembly, 2) enrich for snp markers in the target region around the plarg locus, and 3) verify the performance of our in silico analysis by experimental snp validation. for validation of our method, we chose a subclass of sequences related to known disease resistance genes in plants, because the number of detected sequence polymorphisms between the two bulks was very large and this class of genes was most suitable for the identification of candidate genes for our target locus plarg.

to our knowledge, this is the first study describing snp discovery in a non-model plant based on ngs transcriptome sequencing using two phenotypically and genotypically contrasting bulks and combined with de novo assembly. we show the feasibility of the bsta approach for efficient marker enrichment in a specific target region of a non-model organism. our approach for marker enrichment and candidate gene identification in a target region can be extended to any other species with or without reference genome.

methods
plant material, bulk formation and cdna synthesis
a segregating population comprising  <dig>  f <dig> individuals was developed using ha <dig> as downy mildew susceptible parent and arg1575- <dig> as resistance donor  <cit> . ha <dig> is derived from a single bc1f <dig> plant from the cross ha89*2/pervenets. arg1575- <dig> is an inbred line derived by crossing h. argophyllus accession  <dig>  with cmsha <dig> followed by two generations of backcrossing with cmsha <dig> and five selfing generations. it donates resistance to p. halstedii through the introgression of a h. argophyllus segment on lg <dig> 

resistance to p. halstedii was evaluated after inoculating plants with downy mildew spores . phenotyping of f2: <dig> families derived from ha342xarg1575- <dig> identified homozygous susceptible and homozygous resistant f <dig> plants  <cit> . in addition, molecular marker screening determined the genotypic state of the phenotyped plants in the target interval of  <dig>  cm between the previously mapped microsatellite markers ors <dig> and ht <dig> on lg <dig>  two phenotypically contrasting bulks, one resistant  and one susceptible  to p. halstedii and each comprising 16 f <dig> plants were generated. f <dig> plants that 1) showed a resistant or susceptible phenotype, 2) were homozygous in the target interval as determined by the microsatellite marker genotypes and 3) carried a recombination event above or below the target region were pooled . this pooling strategy avoided heterozygous segments in the target window and delimited the target interval as much as possible.

under the assumption that candidate genes for plarg are constitutively expressed at a weak level in non-inoculated plants  <cit> , seedlings were grown in the greenhouse at a 14 h light /10 h dark  cycle for eight days. hypocotyls, cotyledons, and leaves were harvested separately, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°c. tissue-specific rna extraction was performed using the nucleospin® rna plant kit  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. equal amounts of hypocotyl, cotyledon and leaf rna from the selected 16 f <dig> plants were pooled separately for br and bs. cdna synthesis, normalization, size fractionation and sequencing adapter ligation were performed by vertis biotechnologie ag . for each bulk, a specific hexamer sequence tag  was linked to the 5′-sequencing adapter allowing for filtering of reads after sequencing. normalized, size-fractioned, and adapter-ligated double stranded cdnas of br and bs were pooled and 200 ng was used for  <dig> sequencing.

bsta pipeline
next generation transcriptome sequence analysis
our bulked segregant transcriptome analysis  data processing pipeline consists of three major steps , which are further divided into several components. the first step of the pipeline is the use of next generation sequencing technology to generate transcriptome sequences of sunflower. for the de novo transcriptome sequencing we chose roche  <dig> pyrosequencing because it generates longer reads as compared to the illumina technology  <cit> . sequencing of the br and bs cdna pool was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cdna synthesis primer and sequencing adapter sequences were trimmed from raw  <dig> sequence reads. the two sequence libraries of the br and bs bulks were filtered by removing sequences that were either shorter than 50 nt or of low sequencing quality. the removal of shorter sequences was carried out using a custom python script. the filtering of low quality sequences was done by newbler gs de novo assembler  <dig> . <dig>  automatically before starting the assembling process.

de novo transcriptome assembly
the second step of the bsta pipeline was to create a reference sequence set against which snp calling could be carried out . this step is necessary if no reference genome is available, as is the case in sunflower. if a reference genome is available, reads of the contrasting bulks can directly be mapped against the reference sequence as described in the next paragraph. the two sequence libraries of br and bs bulks were pooled in order to increase coverage and reliability of the reference sunflower transcriptome, which was de novo assembled by the newbler gs de novo assembler. incremental de novo assembly analysis was performed with a parameter setting requiring a minimum sequence overlap length of 40 nt, a minimum overlap identity of 90% and using  <dig> cpu cores. during the transcriptome assembling process, newbler builds a contig graph where the reads coming from the transcript of a certain gene should be assembled into a single contig. however, splice-variants of a single gene may cause a break of the contig graph . in transcriptome assemblies, all transcript variants , each potentially representing the same gene, are collected together and named “isogroup” by newbler. the transcript variants within one isogroup are referred to as isotigs which represent alternative splice-variants, whereas the contigs represent the exons, see additional file 3: figure s <dig>  <cit> . in order to identify bulk specific contigs, br and bs reads were assembled together but the information about the read origin was retained. the developed sunflower transcriptome reference assembly, hereafter called brbs, was then filtered to retain isotigs that were longer than 499 nt. at positions where sequence variants were observed, the major allele was considered as the reference allele. the established sunflower sequence resource comprising the raw sequence data and the assembly is available from the gabi primary database   <cit> .

snp calling and pattern detection in br and bs
during the third major step of the pipeline, br and bs reads were aligned independently to the isotigs of the transcriptome reference sequence . for the application of burrows-wheeler alignment tool , reads were separated into a short read set  and a long read set . the short read set was aligned using bwa  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and the long read set was aligned using bwa-sw   <cit> . alignment results of the short and long read sets from the same bulk were merged by sequence alignment/map tools   <cit> . duplicate  <dig> reads were removed by samtools. pileup files were generated by samtools to facilitate snp calling. in the pileup files each line represents a sequence position of the reference sequences, consisting of the sequence name, position, reference base, number of reads covering the site, read bases and base qualities. following earlier transcriptome-based studies for snp discovery in plants  <cit>  snps with a coverage ≥  <dig> reads per bulk were selected for further snp pattern detection. for each snp in one bulk, the corresponding sequence position was checked in the pileup file from the other bulk to see if, 1) the coverage from the other library was ≥  <dig>  and 2) all the aligned reads from the other bulk had the reference nucleotide at this position. all snp containing sequences that fulfilled these criteria were defined as putative candidate genes.

all computational steps necessary to connect the different software tools for snp calling and pattern detection were performed using custom python scripts.

after snp pattern detection, candidate isogroups were annotated using blast2go  <cit> . in order to identify transcripts involved in disease resistance, tblastx analysis  was performed to detect similarity to  <dig> plant resistance genes from the plant resistance genes database   <cit> . finally, from each resistance-gene-like isogroup one isotig was randomly selected for experimental snp validation.

snp validation and genetic mapping
for confirmation of identified snp polymorphisms and their subsequent genetic mapping, two genotyping systems were adopted. genotyping of isotig sequences in f <dig> individuals of the ha <dig> x arg1575- <dig> population was performed by kbioscience ltd  by applying the kaspar chemistry. isotig sequences for which the in silico test for kaspar assay design was not successful were used to develop cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  markers  <cit> . for sanger re-sequencing of selected isotigs, snp flanking primers were designed using batchprimer <dig>  <cit> . pcr amplification was carried out using dna of the parental lines ha <dig> and arg1575- <dig> as template. the final volume was set to 10 μl containing 275 nm of each primer,  <dig>  u taq dna polymerase , 1x taq dna polymerase buffer,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  and  <dig>  mm of each dntp. amplicons were sequenced in both directions using the specific pcr primers as sequencing primers and the abi prism bigdye® v <dig>  cycle sequence kit  on an abi <dig> following manufacturer’s instructions. raw data were analyzed using software sequencing analysis v <dig> . <dig>  and sequencher v <dig>  . confirmed snp sites in isotig sequences were used for caps marker development by snp2caps  <cit> . for primer details and restriction enzymes see additional file 4: table s <dig> 

the resistance gene candidate rgc <dig> had been identified earlier as co-segregating with the plarg locus  <cit> . one rgc <dig> corresponding isotig sequence , iso <dig>  was only identified in br, thus it was not detected by the pipeline, since the sequence was not represented in bs. however, snp detection in parental lines allowed for the development of a caps marker, and iso <dig> was mapped as a control.

finally, caps markers and snp markers were integrated into the ha342 × arg1575- <dig> genetic map  <cit>  using joinmap  <dig>   <cit>  with a lod threshold >  <dig>  and the kosambi mapping function  <cit> .

RESULTS
next generation sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly
normalized cdna libraries of br and bs were established for marker enrichment and identification of candidate genes for plarg. the brbs cdna pool sequenced using the roche  <dig> approach generated  <dig>  million reads yielding a total of 857 mb raw sequence data. after filtering low-quality reads and reads containing adapter sequences,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> reads  were obtained for br and bs, respectively. finally,  <dig> , <dig> reads  were assembled to a sunflower transcriptome reference  of  <dig>  mb length . the assembly comprising  <dig>  isotigs longer than 499 nt, resulted in  <dig>  isogroups,  <dig>  isotigs,  <dig>  large contigs, and  <dig>  singletons . singletons were excluded from further analysis. according to the description of the newbler software, isogroups, isotigs and contigs approximately represent gene models, transcripts and exons . on average, isogroups were built from  <dig>  contigs and isotigs from  <dig>  contigs. since there are isogroups containing only one contig reflecting single exon genes, the average number of contigs in isogroups is lower than in isotigs. the largest isogroup and the largest isotig consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> contigs, respectively. the average size of isotigs was  <dig>  nt, with a l <dig> length of  <dig>  296 nt and a maximum length of  <dig>  nt. the average number of reads per isotig was  <dig> , with  <dig>  reads from br and  <dig>  reads from bs. interestingly,  <dig>  isotigs were assembled either only by reads from br or bs, indicating that these isotigs represent most probably genes that were present only in br or bs. out of these  <dig>  isotigs,  <dig>  bs-only isotigs and  <dig>  br-only isotigs were assembled by more than five reads.

*definitions of these newbler de novo assembly terms can be found in additional file 5: text s <dig> 

sequence libraries of one resistant bulk  and one susceptible bulk  each containing pooled cdna of  <dig> individual f <dig> plants were generated to perform the  <dig> sequencing.

a sunflower transcriptome reference assembly  was developed by combining reads from the resistant bulk  and the susceptible bulk .

snp discovery
after independent alignment of br and bs reads to the transcriptome reference sequence, snp calling with sam tools resulted in  <dig> , <dig> snps. isogroups carrying one or more snps were subsequently filtered for the read depth  and for distinctive snp patterns as expected in bsa, meaning that snps should be homozygous for one allele in br and homozygous for the alternate allele in bs. according to these criteria, snps were detected in  <dig> out of  <dig>  isogroups and were functionally categorized using blast2go . besides  <dig> sequences that encoded proteins with unknown biological function or gave no hit, the sequences were assigned to the functional classes signal transduction , metabolism , transport , cell rescue, defense and ageing , protein processing , transcription , cellular biogenesis , energy , and protein synthesis  .

the  <dig> isogroups were searched for similarity to a database containing  <dig> manually curated r genes. in total,  <dig> isogroup sequences were identified as putative resistance gene candidates. almost all candidate genes showed sequence homology to the protein class of kinases. twelve were similar to receptor-like kinases , and  <dig> sequences showed homology to the coiled-coil -nbs-lrr  subclass of r proteins. five sequences were similar to r proteins that consist of a leucine-rich receptor-like repeat  and a short cytoplasmic region with no kinase domain. out of each of the  <dig> isogroups that represent resistance gene candidates showing polymorphisms between br and bs, one isotig was randomly selected for experimental snp validation and subsequent integration of markers into the genetic map of ha <dig> x arg1575- <dig> .

genetic mapping of isotig sequences
we used kaspar assays and caps marker analysis for genotyping recombinant f <dig> individuals of the cross ha342xarg1575- <dig> with snps from the  <dig> isotigs. a summary of the snp analysis is given in table  <dig>  using flanking sequences of at least  <dig> bases on both sides of each snp, an in silico kaspar assay was designed, which yielded eight snps for further processing. for caps marker analysis, pcr primers were designed for the remaining  <dig> isotigs from which  <dig> sequences were successfully amplified in the parental lines arg1575- <dig> and ha <dig>  sanger re-sequencing of the  <dig> pcr amplicons confirmed the isotig sequences of the assembled  <dig> reads and allowed for snp confirmation. when comparing sequences of arg1575- <dig> to those of ha <dig> to confirm polymorphisms identified between the resistant and susceptible bulk based on ngs data, snps identified from  <dig> sequences were validated for six isotigs. sanger re-sequencing in arg1575- <dig> and ha <dig> did not confirm the in silico discovered snps of  <dig> isotigs. to map each of the six resistance gene candidates for which isotig polymorphisms were confirmed, one snp per isotig was converted into a caps marker.

proceeding from  <dig> isotigs, the outcome of snp validation and map integration is shown for two genotyping platforms.

for twelve of the fourteen  isotigs with confirmed snp sites both bs and br were homozygous for the corresponding kaspar and caps markers and they mapped on lg <dig> as expected. since they were not linked to other markers in that region, two isotigs  could not be validated as candidate sequences for the target region. ten markers,  <dig> kaspar and  <dig> caps markers, mapped at the top of lg <dig> but outside of the target interval, caps marker iso <dig> mapped below the target interval. however, caps marker iso <dig> mapped in the target interval  <dig>  cm above plarg . additionally, caps marker iso <dig>  which was analysed as a control, mapped in the target interval on lg <dig> and co-segregated with plarg, as expected .

discussion
isolation of candidate genes underlying specific phenotypes by map based cloning requires the identification of markers closely flanking the respective locus  <cit> . bsa was developed for rapid identification of markers linked to any specific gene or genomic region  <cit> . the central idea of bsa is to form dna pools of plants that differentiate with regard to phenotype. any polymorphic marker with clear differentiation of the two bulks will be closely linked to the respective phenotype. a comprehensive marker resource as well as a high resolution mapping population are prerequisites to fine map the target interval for map based cloning in order to identify candidate genes  <cit> . in the present study, we extended the bsa approach to analyze cdna sequences instead of dna-based molecular markers such as microsatellites, which are available only in limited numbers for the target region. the introduction of ngs technologies was a critical development to allow for such a massively parallel approach in a time- and cost efficient way. using cdnas as sequencing templates reduced data complexity compared to whole-genome sequencing and enabled marker discovery in expressed sequences that directly delivered candidates for the trait of interest. our assumption was that plarg is constitutively expressed in non-inoculated plant material, thus we did not include rna from infected tissue, as this has no impact on the development of the pipeline in general.

de novo transcriptome assembly is a computational challenge especially in plant genomes where multiple rounds of genome duplication events during evolution created paralogous copies of ancestral genes. here, newbler gs de novo assembler  <dig> . <dig>  was used to create a sunflower transcriptome assembly . this assembler performed very well or even best on  <dig> transcriptome data in a simulation study  <cit>  as well as in a systematic comparison  <cit>  of different software for de novo assembly. we cannot completely rule out the possibility of creating apparently heterozygous isotigs which result from assembly of paralogous sequences. as there is currently no computational solution that overcomes this specific transcriptome assembly problem, we relied on the experimental snp verification step for obtaining the correct candidate genes. our results proved the feasibility of this strategy.

generally, the sequence alignment can be performed by different ngs alignment programs such as for example bowtie, soap , and the frequently used maq  software. the bwa package was used for read alignment  since it has been shown to reach similar accuracy but is at least ten times faster compared to maq  <cit> . it further allows for the implementation of samtools to extract alignments in a region, merge and sort alignments and to complete snp calls  <cit> . in our study, only snps were considered as polymorphisms but the pipeline can be easily extended to call insertion/deletion polymorphisms.

in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases, the snp validation assays failed at the design stage, either due to a high number of neighboring snps in the respective sequences or due to the lack of sufficiently long suitable flanking sequences for assay design. during the validation procedure,  <dig> out of  <dig> snp containing isotigs were identified as false positives, meaning they were in fact monomorphic between the parental lines. in rare cases, this might be the result of mapping paralogs to the reference sequence, if simultaneously homologous sequences are not present at all in the same bulk. r gene classes often consist of several highly similar family members and often the genes are clustered in the same genomic region  <cit> . meyers et al. <cit>  analyzed a resistance gene cluster in lettuce spanning at least  <dig>  mb. they observed a nucleotide identity of 53–97% between members of the rgc <dig> gene family. but the more likely explanation for the high number of false positives is an insufficient sequence coverage that results in undiscovered heterozygous states of the bulks.

two of the fourteen isotigs  could not be confirmed as candidate genes for the target region by genetic mapping. during snp calling, snps were identified with at least 5-fold sequence coverage in both bulks. coverage in the sequence assemblies of iso <dig> with 5/ <dig>  reads per snp was at the lower limit and might have been too low to provide high-confidence snps. nielsen et al. recommend a >20-fold coverage to achieve a sufficient reliability of snp data  <cit> . however, applying the very stringent criterion of 10/ <dig>  reads per snp would have resulted in a loss of seven of the twelve new snp markers in our case. for iso <dig> and iso <dig>  the dna pools of both bulks in the experimental validation were heterozygous for the corresponding snp markers. since all plants constituting the bulks were chosen to be homozygous in the target interval as determined by the molecular marker genotypes these two snps could not be assigned to the target interval on lg <dig> 

as expected, the control iso <dig> which corresponds to rgc <dig> co-segregated with plarg. this isotig has been assembled only by reads from br. reads from bs covering that region were not present in our dataset, probably due to insufficient sequencing depth. this can be concluded from the fact that from genomic dna of both parents the sequence can be amplified as well as from the observation that the sequence is expressed at low level also in the susceptible parent  <cit> . with decreasing costs for sequencing, it should be feasible in future studies to increase sequence coverage and set more stringent coverage thresholds during snp calling to avoid false positives.

for our purpose, an ideal bulk would contain genotypes that are homozygous in the target interval defined by the markers flanking the plarg locus, with each plant carrying a recombination event on either side of that region for sharply delimiting the target interval. out of the  <dig> isotigs for which the polymorphisms between the two bulks were confirmed,  <dig> candidate sequences were mapped to lg <dig>  f <dig> plants assigned to the susceptible bulk bs did not show a recombination above the resistance locus  resulting in mapping of  <dig> isotigs outside the target interval. iso <dig> mapped between the markers delimiting the target interval as anticipated. the identification of iso <dig> as a new closely linked flanking marker to plarg narrows the target interval from  <dig>  cm  <cit>  to  <dig>  cm in the ha <dig> x arg1575- <dig> population.

non-coding dna regions are less conserved than coding sequences. for that reason the expected snp number is lower when using transcriptome data for snp discovery instead of genomic sequences.

our strategy yielded  <dig> polymorphic snps in r gene like sequences that could be used to fine map lg <dig>  the snp detection pipeline developed for this study had a conversion rate of 33% validated snps  which was lower than in other reports  <cit> . the lower conversion rate was in part attributed to the high number of consecutive polymorphisms within snp flanking sequences . here,  <dig> , <dig> snps were detected in total, regardless of sequence coverage and alignment quality. based on this number, we calculated an upper limit of  <dig> snp/26 bp as snp frequency in the transcriptome reference sequence. for cultivated sunflower a snp density of ~  <dig> snp/65 bp has been reported  <cit> . the high snp density in our dataset may result from the interspecific sequence comparison between h. annuus and h. argophyllus  in the target region. this extraordinary sequence polymorphism together with insufficient length of candidate sequences prohibited the successful assay design for  <dig> out of  <dig> snps . finally, out of  <dig> candidates  <dig> snps have been confirmed which corresponds to a snp confirmation rate of 48%.

sequencing with deeper coverage can improve our method by 1) increasing the probability of an in silico detected snp being a truly polymorphic site, 2) providing sufficient flanking sequence information surrounding the snp that is necessary for experimental snp validation. the establishment of bulks with equally distributed recombination events on both sides of the target interval would further increase the number of true candidate sequences which map inside the target interval. moreover, to enhance the chances for marker enrichment the procedure could be extended to the facultative transcriptome by using pathogen infected plant material as source for cdna libraries.

we have shown that mining for desired gene classes is possible, but our approach is not limited to resistance genes. with respect to further marker enrichment, our future work will focus on the whole set of the  <dig> candidates which represent snps from expressed genes in the target region. two other resources for region-specific markers will be exploited. first, the bioinformatics pipeline will be adjusted to enable indel calling. second, the  <dig> isotigs containing only br sequences will be filtered for r gene-like sequences. as they could be potential candidate genes for plarg expressed only by lines carrying the corresponding gene from the resistant parent, the resulting candidate sequences will be analysed in detail.

in summary, bsta allows for snp marker enrichment in a specific genomic region by generating genome wide transcriptome sequence information. depending on the rna source, the transcriptome can be covered at adequate sequence coverage through deep sequencing. thus, a large sequence resource is produced that can be valorized by mining snps in any expressed gene or for identifying candidate genes in any desired target region. the only prerequisite to identify candidate genes is that the genes of interest are expressed in the sample tissues. resistance genes of the nbs-lrr type generally fulfill this requirement  <cit> . regarding sequencing and de novo assembly, our approach is tailored to transcriptome analysis, but the work plan depicted in figure  <dig> is applicable to bulked segregant whole genome analysis using appropriate sequencing technology and respective bioinformatics tools. as the additional indel-calling, such an extension of snp discovery to non-coding regions would be useful regarding functional analysis of genes such as transcription factor binding sites in promotor regions or loss-of-function due to insertion/deletion mutations.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show the potential of applying the bsta approach for the identification of expressed genes in a target map interval. we focused here on sequences with homology to disease resistance genes, but the approach can be used for efficient enrichment of snp markers in any target interval defined by appropriate phenotypic bulks. to maximize the accuracy and prevent false-positive snp detection, sufficient sequence coverage is necessary and stringent criteria have to be applied to the pipeline. we demonstrated the feasibility of the bsta approach for marker enrichment and fine-mapping of specific genomic regions in a non-model organism.

transcriptome assembly. relationship between isogroups, isotigs and exons according to nederbragt  <dig>  <cit> . during transcriptome assembly, newbler builds contig graphs. reads coming from the transcript of a certain gene will result in a single contig graph. however, splice-variants will result in reads that have an insert representing an additional exon, which can cause a break the contig graph. subsequently, there may be several contigs for each transcript, which themselves form a small contig graph. thus, there will be numerous subgraphs, which are named isogroups by newbler, each potentially representing one gene. to generate transcript variants, newbler will traverse the contigs in the subgraphs of each isogroup, which are called isotigs. the isotigs represent alternative splice-variants, and the contigs represent the exons of a gene.
