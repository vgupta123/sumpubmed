BACKGROUND
more than 10% of human adjacent protein-coding genes are divergently transcribed with their transcription start sites  at a distance <1 kb . “head-to-head”  is used to describe a gene configuration where two adjacent genes are located on opposite strands of dna and transcribed divergently with tsss <1 kb. the sequences between an h2h gene pair  are called bidirectional promoters. the region spanning both genes and the bidirectional promoter region is regarded as an h2h block; genes with h2h organization are called h2h genes . two distinct h2h gene pairs comprise an inter-h2h pair . our previous work has reported that h2h gene pairs are evolutionally conserved, functionally related and co-expressed  <cit> . the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of intra- and inter-h2h gene pairs is still poorly understood and deserves considerable attention.figure  <dig>

it is thought that intra-h2h gene pairs are regulated by bidirectional promoters  <cit> . but what elements and transcription factors  play a vital role during the regulation process is still an open question. it is well known that eukaryotic gene expression regulation involves combinatorial control of tfs, which could be organized both in linear and three-dimensional conformations  <cit> . in our previous report, there proved to be positive expression correlations among h2h gene pairs as well as genes within an individual h2h pair  <cit> . however, the means by which tf regulations can be accomplished over long distances between inter-gene pairs are unknown. it was hypothesized that the establishment of close contacts or chromatin loops may facilitate the process  <cit> . using the new hi-c technology, spatial proximity maps of the human genome have been built  <cit> . with chip-seq data, tfs and modified histones for h2h genes can be identified. by using these data, we identified two distinctive groups of transcription factors mediating intra- and inter-h2h gene transcriptions respectively.

it has been proposed that bidirectional promoters should not be considered under an umbrella classification for one large regulatory network, nor should they be divided into thousands of gene pairs  <cit> . we hypothesized that such h2h genes, may contribute to the compactness of the overall gene regulatory network because they are highly co-expressed. through the construction of human co-expression networks as part of our methodology, we looked into the connections between h2h genes and non-h2h genes and compared their attributes.

RESULTS
characterization of tfs for intra-h2h gene pairs
in this study, there were  <dig> human h2h pairs in dbh2h in total  <cit>  and  <dig> transcription factors are available by using the public chip-seq data in the k <dig> cell line . if the binding sites of one tf overlap with h2h blocks, the tf is regarded to bind to these h2h gene pairs. out of the  <dig> h2h pairs, a total of  <dig> were identified to bind to the  <dig> tfs. we defined tfs that bind to more than 45% of h2h pairs as overrepresented tfs, of which there were  <dig> overrepresented tfs identified . overrepresented transcription factors such as gabp, pol <dig>  e2f <dig>  e2f <dig> and c-myc have been reported in previous studies  <cit> , and transcription factors like hey <dig>  sin3ak- <dig> and srf were first discovered in our study. as we know, h2h genes are mainly enriched in biological processes like dna repair and the cell cycle . overrepresented tfs are mainly involved in active transcriptional activity or regulating genes in the cell cycle process. gabp is the ubiquitous ets-family transcription factor ga-binding protein. it was reported that gabp binding affinity is associated with bidirectional transcriptional activity in a luciferase transfection assay  <cit> . pol <dig> is rna polymerase ii which catalyzes the transcription of dna to synthesize precursors of mrna  <cit> . c-myc target genes are mainly involved in cell growth, apoptosis and metabolism  <cit> . the e2f family plays a crucial role in the control of the cell cycle and tumor suppressor protein activities  <cit> . e2f <dig> and e2f <dig> are involved in the cell cycle regulation. according to gene ontology , protein hey <dig> is an rna polymerase ii core promoter sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor. srf is a transcription factor that binds to the serum response element . this protein regulates the activity of many immediate-early genes, and participates in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell growth, and cell differentiation  <cit> .figure  <dig>

based on the regulation profile of tfs binding to h2h gene pairs, we clustered the tf pairs hierarchically using pearson’s correlation coefficient and ward’s method  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> tfs were clustered into  <dig> groups, one group mostly comprised of overrepresented tfs  and the other group mostly comprised of non-overrepresented tfs .figure  <dig> 
hierarchical clustering of tfs bound to h2h gene pairs. overrepresented tfs are tfs that bind to more than 45% of h2h pairs while other tfs are the non-overrepresented tfs.tfs in the green ellipse are tfs preferring to interact with interacting inter-h2h pairs versus intra-h2h pairs and they all belong to the ‘other tfs’ group.



tf interaction network regulating h2h gene pairs
using the transcription factor data described in methods, we built a binary matrix categorizing whether a given h2h gene pair is regulated by a given tf. by analyzing the correlation between each tf pair , we identified co-occurring tf pairs which bind to the same h2h gene pairs. then we constructed a transcription factor interaction network based on tfs’ co-occurrence.

as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> tfs  are highly connected to each other, and each of them regulates more than 40% of all h2h genes. all these tfs co-regulate h2h genes and most of them are essential for bidirectional promoters in the regulation of intra- h2h genes. tfs in other small subnets are not included in the overrepresented group. however, based on the evidence in the existing literature, most of these tfs are heavily involved in spatial interactions. one subnet is composed of two tfs including ctcf-rad <dig> and another subnet is made up of gata1-gata <dig>  recent genome-wide assays have shown that the transcription factor ctcf can link chromatin domains through long-range interactions between distal genomic regions, suggesting its crucial role as an architect of chromatin conformation. ctcf/rad <dig> mediated insulators maintain the chromatin loop formation and the localization of transcriptional apparatuses at the promoters, suggesting the essential role of chromatin insulation in controlling the expression of clustered genes  <cit> . gata was demonstrated to regulate genes remotely. the knockdown of gata <dig> and gata <dig> altered the expressions of genes close to gata linearly and spatially  <cit> . brg <dig>  connected with other tfs in the subnet , is a protein required for the long-range interaction of a locus control region with a downstream promoter  <cit> . tfs cjun and jund are connected in the tf interaction network. cjun, in combination with c-fos, forms the ap- <dig> early response transcription factor; and jund is a functional component of the ap <dig> transcription factor complex  <cit> . it is reported that long-range transcription controls of ap- <dig> factors play a role in the regulation of the gene pad/ <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig>

since tfs can bridge both promoters and distal cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers, insulators, and silencers while looping out of the intervening dna  <cit> , we looked into the tf distributions in spatially interacting inter-h2h pairs.

inter-h2h gene pairs involved in hi-c supported interaction loci
using interacting genomic regions from hi-c data  <cit> , we mapped h2h gene blocks to long-range interacting loci and identified inter-h2h genes involved in spatial interactions . if both of the interacting loci overlapped with different h2h blocks, the two h2h pairs  were annotated to be spatially interacting with each other. in this way, a total of  <dig> interacting ‘inter-h2h’ pairs with hi-c evidence were selected . to identify the characteristics of those inter-h2h pairs, we compared the tf similarities between interacting inter-h2h pairs and random inter-pairs. a “random inter-pair” are two human genes randomly picked out from all the human genes. the interacting inter-pairs had higher tf similarity scores  than random inter-pairs . the average tf similarity score for interacting inter-pairs is  <dig>  while it is  <dig>  for random inter-pairs. the result indicates that the spatial interaction of inter-h2h genes may be associated with the shared transcription factors.figure  <dig>

as shown in table  <dig>  tfs are ranked by fold changes calculated according to the proportions of tfs binding to inter-h2h pairs compared with tfs binding to intra-h2h pairs. the top tfs with a fold change > <dig> are bdp <dig>  ctcf, gata <dig>  brf <dig>  znf <dig>  brf <dig>  it seems that these tfs may have a stronger preference for binding to inter-h2h vs. intra-h2h. they were clustered in the group marked red in figure  <dig> and differed from the group of overrepresented tfs for bidirectional promoters marked blue. some of these tfs in the red group are indicated in the literature to mediate spatial interactions. ctcf mediates both intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions  <cit> . znf <dig> is involved in the recruitment of kap <dig> and setdb <dig> to specific regions  <cit> . brf <dig>  encoding one of the subunits of rna polymerase iii transcription factor complex, is a general activator of rna polymerase iii transcription  <cit> ; and many pol3-transcribed genes are found spatially clustered at or near the nucleolus  <cit> . we infer that other tfs enriched in interacting inter-h2h pairs and clustered with those reported tfs  may also mediate spatial interactions.

the hi-c results indicate that intra- and inter-h2h pairs show different transcriptional regulation profiles. the tfs of h2h genes can be separated into  <dig> groups. one group  mainly regulates linear intra-h2h gene pairs and the other  is involved in the spatial regulation of inter-h2h pairs. transcription factors such as gabp, pol <dig>  srf, sin2ak- <dig>  hey <dig> and c-myc regulate bidirectional transcription and are enriched in intra-h2h gene pairs, while other factors such as ctcf, bdp <dig> and znf <dig> play important roles in spatial interactions between h2h pairs.table  <dig>

modified histones and hypersensitive dnase bound to h2h gene pairs
 <dig> of the  <dig> h2h pairs are associated with the  <dig> histones and dnase. the distribution of histones and dnase bound to h2h pairs is described in table  <dig>  hypersensitive dnase, h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac and h3k27ac, which are related to transcriptional activation, bind to > =80% h2h pairs; while h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  which are associated with gene silencing  <cit> , are only bound to a small fraction of h2h gene pairs. compared to the background genes, a higher proportion of h2h gene pairs bind to a number of epigenetic markers, such as hypersensitive dnase, h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac and h3k27ac . previous studies have reported that h3k4me <dig> islands overlap with about 85% of active genes  while overlapping with 59% of silent genes ; h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig> protein levels were much higher at silent promoters than at active promoters  <cit> . the above data suggest that h2h gene pairs, bound by modified histones of transactional activation, should be highly expressed. an analysis of whole genome microarray data validated that 68% of h2h genes are transcribed compared to only 44% of all human genes  <cit> .

the role of h2h genes in human co-expression network
since inter-h2h gene pairs interact spatially and h2h gene pairs are biologically important, we speculate as to whether h2h genes are also highly connected to other genes. in this work, we constructed a human co-expression network of  <dig> genes  and calculated the number of co-expressed neighbours of each gene. the percentage of gene counts by number of co-expressed neighbours is shown in figure  <dig>  as it makes clear, h2h genes exhibited higher connectivity than non-h2h genes. the average numbers of co-expressed neighbours for h2h genes and non-h2h genes are  <dig> vs.  <dig>  or  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  . the wilcoxon signed-rank test showed the difference between the two groups  was statistically significant . we also randomly selected genes equal to the number of h2h genes from all genes in the network to compare the amount of co-expressed neighbors between the two groups, repeating this function  <dig> times. h2h genes still showed a higher average connectivity each time . from the above result, we conclude that it is likely that h2h genes are highly connected with other genes  in a human co-expression network.figure  <dig> 
percentage of gene counts by number of co-expressed neighbors. non-h2h genes are genes without h2h gene organization.



it was reported that co-expressed genes tend to be co-regulated by one or more common transcription factors  <cit> . since h2h genes tend to be highly connected to other genes in the co-expression network and have distinctive groups of transcription factors mediating intra- and inter-h2h gene transcriptions, we propose that h2h genes contribute to the compactness of the overall gene regulatory network.

CONCLUSIONS
a systematic investigation of h2h genes, their transcription factors and the histones and dnase bound to them based on human genome hi-c, chip-seq and dnase-seq data was conducted in this study. we echoed and adjusted several known properties of h2h gene organization and also provided new observations on the spatial regulation of h2h genes. we further demonstrated that h2h intra-pairs and inter-pairs are regulated by two distinct groups of transcription factors. the binding of hypersensitive dnase and the modified histones associated with active transcription may facilitate the high expression of h2h genes. finally, we analysed the properties of h2h genes in a human co-expression network and found that h2h genes tend to be highly connected to other genes. we propose that the highly expressed h2h genes, regulated through both linear and spatial interactions, contribute to the compactness and thus the high efficiency of the entire gene regulatory network.
