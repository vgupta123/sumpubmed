BACKGROUND
peanut  is an important crop for oil and protein production in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, asia is the top region of peanut planting with the growing area of  <dig> million ha . the bacterial wilt caused by ralstonia solanacearum is a destructive soil borne peanut disease in asia. it could cause peanut production reduction at least of 10% even a mass extinction. r. solanacearum has a wide host range expanding over more than  <dig> plant species
 <cit> . the process of r. solanacearum infecting plant had been well characterized in model crop, briefly, the r. solanacearum penetrated into cortical tissue of host roots, colonized and exploded in numbers, caused a sudden deadly wilt of plant
. the resistant breeding is the most ideal strategy for controlling bacterial wilt with great benefit of economy and environmental protection
 <cit> . however, even in the resistance varieties, r. solanacearum can multiply in a high level of number and caused the symptoms of stunted growth, weak wilting and reduced resistance to other pathogens, finally resulted in a potential crop failure
 <cit> . up to now, the molecular basis of peanut resistance to r. solanacearum is poorly understood.

understanding the complexity of disease resistance will contribute to the development of peanut resistance to bacterial wilt. in the past few decades, the molecular cross-talk between plants and pathogens had been characterized, the intrinsic mechanism of plant resistance to pathogens had been well documented
. during plant-pathogen interactions, plant evolved a two-tiered innate immunity system to defend against pathogens attack. the host cell surface localized pattern-recognition receptors  recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns , then activated the pamp-triggered immunity  followed by pathogen effector-triggered immunity . in pti and eti, a set of defense response on transcriptome level were activated, and resulted in the arrest of pathogen clone
. however, the molecular reaction between plant and r. solanacearum have received far less attentions.

efforts had been made in discovering the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions between arabidopsis–, tomato–, potato– r. solanacearum, several resistance related genes and enzymes had been well characterized
. the significant changes on level of transcriptome and proteome were also observed in interaction between plant and r. solanacearum. especially, the mechanism of silicon in priming tomato resistance to r. solanacearum has been systematically studied
 <cit> , roles of cell wall proteins in tomato defend against r. solanacearum were well discussed
. these have provided preliminary understanding of molecular mechanism of plant response to r. solanacearum. up to now, the resistant mechanism of plant to r. solanacearum is obscure, the literature and molecular resources available for plant resistance to r. solanacearum remain to be enriched. about  <dig>   <dig> ests differentially expressed in plant after r. solanacearum challenge were identified in previous study . the present informations are too poor to clearly shed light on the mechanism behind plant resistance to r. solanacearum. the genetic control factors that determined the consequence between plant and r. solanacearum are not yet fully identified, and changes in the global transcriptome of plant resistance to r. solanacearum is yet to be explored. it is still a great challenge to isolate genes by map-based cloning for the huge genome size of peanut. the traditional methods of sequencing cdna clones resulted in the loss of rare transcript with inefficient cost, low throughput and lack of quantitation of the transcripts. recent years, rna sequencing technologies were developed, it is a more comprehensive and efficient way to carry study of transcriptome level on detecting the expression pattern, explore new exons and novel genes
 <cit> . especially, the application of this technology is not limited to the prior knowledge of genomic sequence, it had been successfully applied in peanut transcriptome study on development and response to stress
.

in the present study, we invested globally and compared the transcriptome profile in the roots of peanut resistant  and susceptible  genotypes under r. solanacearum infection. the dynamic differences of transcriptome profiles in peanut roots under r. solanacearum infection were investigated. the specific transcripts related to peanut response to r. solanacearum were identified. the possible roles of differentially expressed unigenes  were discussed and the resistant mechanism of peanut to r. solanacearum was also deduced. in addition, a better understanding of peanut resistance to r. solanacearum could be a reference for exploring the resistance to bacterial pathogen in other crop plants. this study also provided a significant transcriptome resource in systemic plant-r. solanacearum interactions.

RESULTS

transcriptome sequencing and de novoassembly
in this study, we performed transcriptome analyses of  <dig> samples to profile peanut response to r. solanacearum, it resulted in a total of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m bp . the comprehensive reads were assembled into transcripts using paired-end reads, it resulted in the  <dig>   <dig> comprehensive transcripts. under the criteria of more than 50-bp overlap and 90% identity, the transcripts were further assembled into  <dig>   <dig> unigenes using tgicl. total of  <dig>   <dig> all-unigenes were clustered by at least two unigenes, with a maximum of  <dig> unigenes per all-unigene, and the rest  <dig>   <dig> were corresponding to single unigenes. the total length of all-unigenes was about  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> bp  covering  <dig> % of peanut genome , the size of unigenes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> bp with an average length of  <dig> bp, the n <dig> value were  <dig>   <dig> bp . for each sample, it generated a massive number of unigenes ranged from  <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig>   <dig>  . the sequencing data generated in this study were deposited in ncbi sequence read archieve under the project id prjna <dig> table  <dig>

function annotation
to characterize the unigenes, they were searched against nr protein database using blastx. for all  <dig>   <dig> unigenes,  <dig>   <dig>  unigenes had no match with nr record,  <dig>   <dig>  unigenes matched protein accessions in nr database, only  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> unigenes  were assigned valuable nr annotations . for sequence similarity analyses by blast against nt database,  <dig>   <dig>  unigenes had matched significant similar sequences . the  <dig> % sequences have strong homology at the e-value of ≤ <dig> e- <dig> of top hit in the nt database. . to get a more overall view of present sequences, they were searched against special database of arachis species, glycine max and arabidopsis with a cutoff of e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  for the increasing of peanut transcripts from sanger and rna-sequencing, a present largest database for arachis species database  were built 
 <cit> . up to  <dig>   <dig>  of  <dig>   <dig> unigenes matched  <dig>   <dig> contigs of arachis species.  <dig>   <dig> unigenes matched to  <dig>   <dig> sequence from glycine max and  <dig>   <dig> unigenes matched to  <dig>   <dig> genes from arabidopsis, respectively . it also observed that  <dig>   <dig> unigenes matched  <dig>   <dig> genes of r. solanacearum genome . this observation proved a reliable representation of the comprehensive transcriptome in which even r. solanacearum transcripts were detected.

to further characterized sequence annotation, all unigenes were searched against cog database to analyze phylogenetically widespread domain families. from present unigenes set,  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>   <dig> unigenes have significant homologies in cog database . a total of  <dig>   <dig> unigenes were assigned to the  <dig> functions categories . among this, the top six categories included “replication, recombination and repair” , “translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis” , “transcription” , “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones”  and “signal transduction mechanisms” .  <dig>   <dig>  of unigenes were grouped into “defense mechanism”.

following the nr annotations, all unigenes were mapped into the records of go database.  <dig>   <dig> of them retrieved  <dig>   <dig> annotations from  <dig> sub-categories of three go categories. “biological process” took up the majority of go annotations , followed by “molecular function”  and cellular component  . due to the limited descriptions, a small proportion of unigenes with go distributions was determined.

finally, the kegg analyses were performed to identify the biological pathways in peanut root. in total,  <dig>   <dig>  out of  <dig>   <dig> were assigned  <dig> kegg pathways . these pathways belonged to  <dig> clades of four categories of “metabolism” , “genetic information processing” , “environment information processing” , “cellular process”  . among them, the top six pathways were, “carbohydrate metabolism”, “amino acid metabolism”, “lipid metabolism”, “energy metabolism”, “nucleotide metabolism” and “signal transduction”.figure  <dig> 
kegg analysis of unigeness. the all-unigenes were assigned into  <dig> clades of kegg pathways under five major categories: metabolism , genetic information processing , cellular process , environmental information processing .



cluster analysis of transcriptome
to get a global view of transcriptional profiles of peanut response to r. solanacearum colonization, clustering algorithms and treeview were used to analyze the transcripts profiles for the  <dig> samples . they showed similar profiles at paired time points between both genotypes and distinct sample-specific profiles in each genotype. generally, the similar transcriptome patterns were found among control samples  and earlier inoculated samples , respectively. the up-regulated genes appeared a peak at  <dig> hour post-inoculation. interestingly, the samples of r <dig> and s <dig> shared similar transcriptome pattern.figure  <dig>

r. solanacearum
. clustering algorithms and treeview analysis were done for  <dig> sub-libraries. for both control and inoculated samples, similar gene expression profiles were shared by samples from paired time points. green indicates the low expression, black indicates intermediate expression, and red indicates the high expression.



identification of degs
in present study, after the multiple comparisons, the degs were identified under the two criteria, the average fold change was at less equal to or more than two with the p-value under  <dig>  and fdr ≤  <dig>  . the differential comparisons between control and inoculated samples resulted in the rd and sd series data sets . these ten series data sets represented the degs responding to r. solanacearum challenge of both genotypes. the comparison between inoculated samples resulted in d series data sets, which represented the degs between s and r genotype in response to r. solanacearum infection .figure  <dig> 
the scatter plot comparing the gene expression levels between rc <dig> and r <dig> 




the dynamic trends of degs in rd, sd and d data sets were investigated. it was obviously observed that remarkable changes of transcriptome profile occured at  <dig> hour . the number of down-regulated degs was markedly more than those up-regulated at first three time points in s and all five time points in r genotype . the total degs and up-regulated degs showed similar changing trends through  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h . the distinct dynamic trends were observed for the down-regulated degs. for d series data sets, the numbers of degs decreased sharply and persistently went up through all time points, indicating that considerable parts of degs were shared by two genotypes and more and more evident changes in transcriptome profiles during the process of r. solanacearum multiplication between r and s genotype .

the property of up- and down-regulated degs between neighboring data sets was also investigated. the percentage of degs exclusive to their own data sets was showed . for up-regulated degs, they were more exclusive to data sets of  <dig> and  <dig> in rd and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in sd and less overlap in their neighboring data sets . for down-regulated degs, they showed more community in neighboring data sets of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h in rd and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h in sd . the data sets of rd <dig> and sd <dig> owned the least exclusivity degs, they were mostly shared by data sets of  <dig> and  <dig> h .figure  <dig> 
the dynamic changes of number of degs at series time points. the dynamic trends of degs number for total, up-regulated and down-regulated degs were showed in figure a, b and c, respectively. the red lines represent the s data sets, and the blue lines represent the r data sets, the green lines represent the d data sets.
the distribution of up-and down-regulated degs between neighboring data sets. the numbers of degs that were exclusively up- or down-regulated in each data sets were shown in circle. the numbers of degs shared by neighbor data sets were shown in the overlapping regions. the total numbers of up- or down-regulated genes at each time point were shown outside the circles. a and b represent degs up-regulated, c and d represent degs down-regulated in r and s genotype post inoculation; e and f represent degs up- and down-regulated in r genotype than that in s genotype.



the co-expression pattern of degs
to identify genes shared same expression pattern, the co-expression patterns of degs were further investigated in rd and sd data sets  and d data sets . it uncovered various and genotype-specific expression patterns of degs, and the down-regulation and less share of co-expressed degs were dominated in both genotypes. the most popular expression patterns shared by both genotypes were down-regulated meanwhile at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> degs in r and s genotype respectively,  <dig> degs were shared by both genotypes.

experimental verification of degs
to verify the reliability of sequencing-based approach in identifying r. solanacearum -responsive genes, we monitored the expression pattern of twelve candidate degs at the five time points post inoculation for both genotypes using qrt-pcr. these candidate degs included genes that were proved to be related to defend response in other plant species, such as r genes and genes involving in ethylene signal transduction pathways. their expression showed basically linear correlation to the results of the rna- sequencing .

the annotation of degs
for functional annotation of degs, the kegg enrichment analyses were mainly referenced. the enrichment analyses showed that more degs with down-regulation were involved in “carbohydrate metabolism” than those with up-regulation at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h in s genotype and all five time points in r genotype, with significant enrichment at  <dig> h in r and  <dig> h in s genotype, respectively . for d series data sets, the more degs with down-regulation were involved in “carbohydrate metabolism” at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h . the enrichment analyses indicated that the “carbohydrate metabolism” was inhibited post inoculation in both genotypes and more extensive inhibition in r genotype. the main concerned pathways were “glycolysis/gluconeogenesis”, “citrate cycle”, “starch and sucrose metabolism, “propanoate metabolism” and “pyruvate metabolism”. degs involved in carbohydrate metabolism were vastly inhibited in both genotypes at more than three time points with more than  <dig> fold of expression decrease , including genes which encoded pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> component , isocitrate dehydrogese , malic enzyme , fructosidase  and phosphoglucose isomerase . remarkably, the most dominant expression pattern were observed on the degs having domain of sugar transporter , almost all degs  encoding sugar transporter were down-regulated with same expression pattern in both genotypes. these genes take fundamental roles in carbohydrate metabolism .figure  <dig> 
kegg enrichment analyses of carbohydrate metabolism. the enrichment of degs in pathways of carbohydrate metabolism in r data sets , s data sets  and d data sets .



similar results were observed in metabolism of energy and lipid, degs with down-regulation were more than those with up-regulation at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h in s genotype and all time points in r genotype . for d series data sets, the more degs with down-regulation involved these two pathways than those with up-regulation at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. the main related pathway was “oxidative phosphorylation” and “fatty acid metabolism”, the expressions of degs these two pathways were decreased hundreds of times than those in s genotype .

interestingly, it observed that the numbers of the up-regulated degs were close to or more than those of down-regulated degs at  <dig> and  <dig> h in s genotype. however, the degs with up regulation involved in enrichment analysis were significantly less than those with down regulation, the number declined disproportionately. for example of the degs involved in metabolism of carbohydrate, energy and lipid at  <dig> h, the percentages of up-regulation degs were almost half or less than those of down-regulated degs, they were  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for carbohydrate metabolism,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . further analysis showed that, compared with down-regulated degs, low percentage of kegg annotations occured on up-regulated degs in r genotype at  <dig> h and in s genotype at  <dig> and  <dig> h.

in d data set, the degs showed always down or up regulation through all five time points with ipr annotation were list here . due to the lack of informative annotations, only  <dig> of  <dig> with up-regulation and  <dig> of  <dig> with down-regulation had ipr annotation, one r gene  showed higher expression in r than in s genotype through all five time points. degs encoding leucine-rich repeat  was significantly down-regulated in s genotype, two member of myb family  and zinc finger  were significantly down- and up-regulated in s than in r genotype.table  <dig>

the expression patterns of defense-related genes
the expression patterns of genes taking key roles in plant resistance to pathogens were investigated, including those of the nbs-lrr  genes, the genes encoding leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein , map kinase and wrky factors, the degs related to adp ribosylation, the genes involved in synthesis of phytoalexins including lectin, terpenoid and chalcone, and the genes involved in ethylene, salicylic acid and cytokinkins signaling pathways, and the factors involved in defense pathways such as reactive oxygen species , cell wall proteins and pathogenesis-related proteins .

total  <dig> degs with domain of lrr-rlk  were identified . almost all of them were down-regulated in both genotypes, only two of them were up-regulated at  <dig> or  <dig> h in both genotypes. both genotypes showed distinct expression patterns with often down regulation at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in r and  <dig> and  <dig> h in s genotype . compared with s genotype, nineteen were up-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h in r genotype. especially, one deg  was significant up-regulated at all five time points, without detection in all samples including control samples of s genotype. six degs encoding fls <dig> was a documented well lrr-rlk.figure  <dig>

total  <dig> nbs-lrr type r genes were identified . they were mainly down-regulated continuously at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in r genotype and intermittently down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h in s genotype , and showed slightly up- or down-regulation between r and s genotype at single time points. compared to s genotype, only one  was up-regulated at five time points in r genotype, the degs encoding glycine max r gene rpm <dig>  and one r gene  were significantly up-regulated  at  <dig> h in r genotype. interestingly, total  <dig> degs encoding medicago truncatula disease resistance protein rps <dig>  twenty-eight of them were shared by both genotypes.

total  <dig> degs encoding wrky factor  were identified . two degs, ahy <dig> and ahy <dig> were down-regulated at all five time points in r genotype and without expression difference in s genotype,  <dig> degs were meanwhile up-regulated at  <dig> h in both genotypes including degs encoding wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> of glycine max. four degs were significantly down-regulated, wrky <dig>  at  <dig> h and wrky <dig>  at  <dig> h in r genotype, wrky <dig>  at  <dig> h and wrky <dig>  at  <dig> h in s genotype. compared with the expression pattern of r genes, the expression of wrky showed an opposite pattern with up-regulation at  <dig> h when the r genes were down-regulated .

total  <dig> degs encoding map kinase  were identified, most of them were down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h in r genotype and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h in s genotype . degs encoding mek <dig> were down-regulated in both genotype, degs encoding mek <dig> was up-regulated at  <dig> h in r genotype. similar expression pattern were observed in calcium-dependent protein kinases , they were mainly down-regulated in both genotypes .

five degs encoding adp-ribosylation factor  were identified with down regulation in r or s genotype . and one  was up-regulated post inoculation and with no detection in control samples in both genotypes. compared with s genotype, the expression of ahy <dig> was down-regulated at  <dig> h and then significantly up-regulated at  <dig> h in r genotype.

for the degs involving in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins, most of them were down-regulated at both genotypes with different expression patterns at later stages. for degs encoding domain of lectin , compared with control, the down-regulation is mainstream in both genotypes . interestingly, all eleven degs with ricin b lectin domain were down-regulated in r genotype meanwhile five of them were significantly up-regulated in s genotype.

twenty-one degs encoding chalcone synthase were significant down-regulated at  <dig> h in r genotype and at  <dig> h in s genotype . for degs encoding terpenoid synthase, significant down-regulated occured  <dig> h in both genotypes .

in ros, the degs encoding peroxidase  were down regulated with distinct expression pattern in both genotypes and showed significant up-regulation in s genotype when compared to r genotype . the expression pattern of cell wall protein also showed differential regulation . degs encoding callose synthase  were down regulated in both genotypes and with higher expression in s genotype when compared to r genotype. on the contrary, degs encoding pectinesterase  and polygalacturonase  were down-regulated in s genotype, one pg  were significant down-regulated at  <dig> h in s genotype when compared to r genotype, both are key enzymes in cell wall degradation . interestingly, in the cog annotation, the degs involved in cell wall biosynthesis generally showed significant up regulation in s than in r genotype . degs encoding pr protein showed different regulation. compared to r genotype, degs encoding pr- <dig>  were no detected in all samples  in r genotypes with a significant up-regulation at  <dig> h in s genotype, pr- <dig>  and pr- <dig>  were significantly down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h respectively in s genotype, one pr- <dig>  was up-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> h respectively in s genotype, one pr- <dig>  was significantly down regulated in both genotypes with no difference between them.

discussion
assembly and annotation of transcriptome
rna-seq technologies are powerful for de novo transcripts assembly, identification of novel genes and analysis of transcriptional profiles
 <cit> . in present study, rna-seq enabled the generation of huge amounts of sequence reads, for characterization of the transcriptional changes of peanut roots under r. solanacearum challenges. more than  <dig> gbp were generated. the parameters of present transcriptome were far more than those of previous reports in the number of total bp and reads, value of n <dig>  average length of unigenes and coverage of genome sequence. the characters of other transcriptome researches were shown here: covering  <dig> mbp of both genomes and  <dig>   <dig> contigs with average length of  <dig> bp for arachis wild species
 <cit> ,  <dig>  million paired-end reads and  <dig>   <dig> unigenes with average length of  <dig> bp and n <dig> value of 823
 <cit> ,  <dig>  mbp of genome sequence,  <dig>   <dig> contigs with average length of  <dig> bp and n <dig> value of 974
 <cit> , and the coverage of genome sequence were also more than the data from published database which represented  <dig>  mb ) and  <dig>  mb  genome sequences, respectively. it is well known that due to the lack of available annotations for the limited basic research in peanut, the huge number of unigenes  had no any matches in nr database, it added the difficulty of evaluation and understanding of peanut transcriptome.

similar transcriptome profiles between r and s genotypes
we performed a time course transcriptome analysis to investigate the roots global response between peanut r and s genotypes during r. solanacearum colonization. the previous reported that the plant resistance to r. solanacearum were mainly focused on stem  as well as our studies , however, the inhibition of root development was also observed in apparently healthy peanut , our primary study had revealed a significant difference on root bacterial population at  <dig> h post inoculation between r and s genotype . so study on the roots response to r. solanacearum could contribute to comprehensively understand the mechanism of plant resistance to r. solanacearum. the cluster analyses suggested a high synchronization in root development of both genotypes  and early response to r. solanacearum infection . unexpectedly, the cluster analysis failed to build similarity between the transcriptome profiles of rc <dig> vs rc <dig> and sc <dig> vs sc <dig>  showed a dramatic transcriptome change even in the developmental stage of root during only in  <dig> hours. interestingly, the similarity patterns of transcriptomes were shared by r <dig> and s <dig>  which indicated an earlier and more rapid molecular response to r. solanacearum infection in r genotype. although the great difference of an order of magnitude of the bacterial population was observed at  <dig> hour post inoculation, however, the different transcriptomes were observed as early as  <dig> h post inoculation, it could be deduced that the resistance to r. solanacearum was determined earlier in r genotype before the multiplication of bacteria was inhibited in roots.

the primary metabolisms were inhibited after inoculation in both genotypes
for rd, sd and d series datasets, the enrichment of degs acted in primary metabolism was observed by kegg analyses. the collective behavior of degs indicated that the primary metabolisms were inhibited at early stage in s and whole stage in r genotype, and more evident inhibition of primary metabolism occured on r genotype. up to now, the roles of primary metabolism in plant defense are not clear and less characterized
 <cit> . although a number of studies showed that the genes acted in primary metabolism were up-regulated and identified as positive roles in plant resistance response
 <cit> . interestingly, in the cases of wheat response to powdery mildew and arabidopsis thaliana response to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, the genes acting in primary metabolism  were down-regulated, the switchs from primary metabolism to defense metabolism were observed
 <cit> . the change of primary metabolism in host plant caused by pathogen had been documented
 <cit> . it is a consensus that the host plant defense response to pathogen and inhibition growth of pathogen is cost-intensive, the nutrition and energy were transported from primary metabolism to the defense interaction
 <cit> . however, it also showed a very complicated regulation of genes involving in the primary metabolism for their up- or down-regulation even in the same pathways
 <cit> . interestingly, in present study, the expression pattern of degs encoding sugar transporter  were opposite to those were previous reported. the sugar transporter were induced to supply nutrient for the pathogen colonization in the cases of arabidopsis to bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig> and powdery mildew fungus g. cichoracearum, rice to xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae <cit> . it seemed that the peanut reduced the nutrition supply to r. solanacearum by down-regulation of sugar transport. in the case of peanut bacterial wilt, even in the incompatible interactions between peanut r genotype and r. solanacearum, the concentration of r. solanacearum is up to the 108cfu/ml even in the r genotype during a long period post inoculation. it could be assumed that the more nutrition and energy was switched to the defense pathways by more intensive and longer-lasting down-regulation of primary metabolism in r genotype, and the down-regulation of primary metabolism is contributed to the resistance difference between r and s genotypes.

the pti and eti were partly suppressed in both genotypes
the molecular event occured in eti and pti had been documented and the key components of pti and eti were characterized well
. the sequential molecular events caused by pathogens were perception of pamp by prr, and then activation of the mapk cascade followed the activation of wrky-type transcription and r gene. and the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases  were identified as one of prr. in arabidopsis, the lrr-rlk, named fls <dig>  can bind bacterial flagellin peptides and contribute to resistance
 <cit> . fls <dig> is a component of the preexisting recognition system, its expression was not affected by flagellin. however, in present study, the expressions of degs encoding lrr-rlk including fls2-like kinase were mainly down-regulated, and one lrr-rlk  was not detected in all samples from s genotype, the role of ahy <dig> deserves to be further studied. after perception of pamp, the mapk cascade was activated and mkk <dig> acted positively and mkk <dig> acted negatively in pti in arabidopsis <cit> . the expression pattern indicated that a similar regulation of mapk component occured on the interaction of peanut to r. solanacearum like that in arabidopsis to bacterial pathogen. the mapk cascade then activated wrky-type transcription factors which act in a complex defense response network as both positive and negative regulators in plant immunity
 <cit> . the wrky <dig> took negative role in arabidopsis response to r. solanacearum, on the contrary, the cawrky <dig> promoted tobacco resistance to r. solanacearum <cit> . the cawrky <dig> took a positive role in pepper resistance to r. solanacearum <cit> . the wrky <dig> were positively regulated in brachypodium distachyon response to pathogens
 <cit> . in this study, the identified degs encoding wrky showed distinct expression pattern in both genotypes, wrky <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> were up-regulated and wrky <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were down-regulated, it could be deduced that the wrkys acted positively and negatively in peanut resistance to r. solanacearum, the exact roles of wrky still need further study. based on the expression pattern analysis of components in pti, with consideration of the increased bacterial populations in both genotypes , it seemed that the components of pti were activated, however, the r. solanacearum partly inhibited pti in both genotypes.

in the followed eti, the two types of nbs-lrr genes, cc-nbs-lrr and tir-nbs-lrr were identified and with general down-regulation post-inoculation, and three r genes showed higher expression in r than in s genotype, it argued that the nbs-lrr type of r genes were responsible for peanut resistance to r. solanacearum. the r gene was the central component in eti by detecting and binding to bacterial effectors and triggered the subsequent defense response. more interestingly, one cc-nbs-lrr type of r gene, the rps <dig> of medicago truncatula was represented by  <dig> unigenes with down-regulation in both genotypes. the soybean rps <dig>  was identified as the resistance gene to phytophthora sojae which cause root and stem disease in soybean
 <cit> . it raised the suspicion that the rps <dig> mediated partially the resistance of peanut to r. solanacearum. the degs encoding glycine max r gene rpm <dig>  were also identified with down-regulation in both genotypes and higher regulation in r genotype. the arabidopsis rpm <dig> is a resistance gene responding to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  it associates physically with bacterial fls <dig> which destabilizes host adp ribosylation factor atmin <dig> which is required for both pti and eti in arabidopsis <cit> . the expression pattern of ahy <dig> encoding adp ribosylation factor indicated that the degradation of adp-ribosylation was more effectively blocked in r genotype, ahy <dig> and ahy <dig> maybe act like rpm <dig> and atmin <dig> respectively in arabidopsis response to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  thus the pti in r genotype was rescued by eti.

in pti and eti, the salicylic acid  and et signaling pathway involves in the activation of defense-related genes that contribute to resistance to pathogen
 <cit> . erfs involved in sa and et signaling pathways and take positive or negative roles in plant immunity response
 <cit> . in present study, many types of erf were identified, erf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated and erf <dig> was down-regulated in both genotypes, this reproduced the results of our previous report, and confirmed the biosynthesis of et may contribute to peanut resistance to r. solanacearum <cit> . the plant cytokinins involved in the resistance to pathogen and promoted the accumulation of salicylic acid in plant defense response
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, zeatin involved in the defense response of r gene rpm <dig> and caused the accumulation of salicylic acid
 <cit> . recent research showed that sa positively regulated arabidopsis reistance to r. solanacearum <cit> . given the up-regulation of degs involved in zeatin biosynthesis and down-regulation of samt, which balances the level of salicylic acid by methylating sa
 <cit> , it appeared the promotion of zeatin lead to the accumulation of salicylic acid, both cytokinins and sa synergistically acted in peanut resistance to r. solanacearum in both genotypes, but did not contribute to the resistance difference between r and s genotype.

as the result of r gene-mediated resistance, the ros and cell wall proteins as well as pr proteins contributed to a final immune response to pathogen
 <cit> . in present study, pod were up-regulated in s than in r genotype, which involved in production of ros and reinforcement of the cell wall, increased tomato resistance to r. solanacearum <cit> . interestingly, compared to r genotype, degs involved in cell wall biosynthesis, such as cals, pod and degs with cog’s annotation of cell wall biosynthesis were generally up-regulated in s genotype, meanwhile those involved in cell wall degradation  were down-regulated in s genotype. it could be understand that the degs involving in cell walls were inhibited in both genotypes under a high inoculation pressures, however, a more intense defense response in cell wall biosynthesis occurred in s genotype. the induction of pr protein indicates activation of systematic acquired resistance to pathogen, pr protein including pr <dig>  pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> were identified as positive roles in tomato resistance to r. solanacearum . in present study, pr- <dig> were detected only in inoculated samples of s genotype and rc <dig>  pr- <dig> were down regulated in s genotype meanwhile one pr- <dig> showed up regulation in s genotype, their expression were different from those in tomato, indicated a potential different role of them in peanut resistance to r. solanacearum.

CONCLUSIONS
in present study, we have investigated the transcriptome in roots of peanut r and s genotypes response to r. solanacearum infection at five time points. the dynamics profiles of transcriptome during the infection were roughly characterized. both genotypes showed a general similarity on transcriptome level at early time points, meanwhile resistance-related degs showed distinct genotype-specific expression pattern in response to r. solanacearum challenge. the enrichment analyses for the degs showed genotype-specific patterns of transcriptome remodelling under r. solanacearum challenge. the present work provided the largest unigene dataset for cultivated peanut response to r. solanacearum infection, greatly expanded the vision of the genetic basis and improved our understanding on the molecular mechanisms underlying peanut resistance to r. solanacearum.
