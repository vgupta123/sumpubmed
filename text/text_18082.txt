BACKGROUND
the high incidence of adverse outcomes after traumatic brain injury  has been attributed in large part to secondary mechanisms of neuronal cell death  <cit> . these include the induction of neuronal apoptosis and complement-mediated neuronal cell lysis  <cit> . recent evidence suggests that the intracerebral activation of the complement cascade influences the fate of neurons by other than just the "classical" neuroinflammation-mediated effects  <cit> . for example, neuronal apoptosis can be induced by complement activation products, e.g. by binding of the anaphylatoxin c5a to its receptor  expressed on neurons  <cit> . in addition, complement-mediated neuronal cell lysis can occur through the membrane attack complex  following inactivation of the physiological cellular protection mechanisms against homologous complement-mediated cell death  <cit> . insights from recent experimental studies on intracerebral mac injection underline the important role of the membrane attack pathway of complement in contributing to secondary neurodegeneration  <cit> . posttraumatic complement activation and tissue deposition of the mac were furthermore demonstrated in injured human and rodent brains by immunohistochemistry  <cit> . in addition, we have reported elevated levels of soluble mac in human cerebrospinal fluid  after severe head injury  <cit> .

up to date, most studies which investigated the role of complement activation in the injured brain have focused on the effects of the complement cascade at a point where all three activation pathways converge, i.e. at the level of c <dig> or further downstream in the cascade  <cit> . thus, the role which the individual pathways of complement activation play in the pathophysiology of tbi has not yet been determined. recent studies established the alternative pathway of complement activation as a "key player" in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion-mediated inflammatory diseases outside the cns  <cit> . for example, complement activation in renal ischemia/reperfusion injury was shown to be mediated almost exclusively by the alternative pathway  <cit> . in clinical studies on tbi patients, we have reported elevated levels of the crucial components required for alternative pathway complement activation, factor b and c <dig>  in the csf of severely head-injured patients  <cit> .

here, we demonstrate for the first time an important role of the alternative complement pathway in contributing to posttraumatic neuronal cell death, based on a standardized tbi model in factor b gene-deficient mice.

RESULTS
complement activation is attenuated in brain-injured fb-/- mice
screening of serum samples from all fb-/- mice and wild-type littermates  used in the present study revealed that factor b was only detectable in serum of fb+/+ animals, but not in the fb-/- mice. these control experiments were performed to ascertain that the knockout mice are completely devoid of factor b in serum. an exemplary western blot is shown in fig.  <dig> 

experimental closed head injury in wild-type c57bl/ <dig> mice resulted in a systemic activation of the complement cascade, as determined by significantly elevated serum levels of the complement activation product c5a at all time-points assessed from  <dig> hours to  <dig> days . in contrast, anaphylatoxin c5a serum levels were not induced in fb-/- mice at all corresponding time-points after head trauma and found to be in a similar range to baseline levels in normal c57bl/ <dig> or fb-/- mice . the data indicate the lack of c5a increase in sera of fb-/- mice. it seems likely that this is due to impaired generation of c5a via the alternative pathway of complement activation, although accelerated metabolic destruction of c5a in the absence of factor b cannot be ruled out. these findings imply that the alternative pathway is the source for complement activation after brain injury, a notion which was previously substantiated for other inflammatory diseases outside the cns, such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune nephritis, and ischemia/reperfusion injuries  <cit> .

experimental head injury induced mean anaphylatoxin c5a levels in serum of around  <dig> ng/ml within  <dig> days in wild-type mice . serum c5a levels described in the literature due to triggers for complement activation other than cns trauma are in the range of  <dig> ng/ml, as described for patients with severe sepsis  <cit> . with regard to central nervous system inflammation, we have previously reported significantly elevated c5a levels in human csf of patients with bacterial meningitis , as compared to patients with aseptic/viral meningitis  <cit> . c5a levels were not detectable in normal csf of n =  <dig> healthy humans with a lower limit of sensitivity of the assay at  <dig>  ng/ml  <cit> . thus, the serum c5a levels detected in brain-injured c57bl/ <dig> mice in the present study appear to reflect concentrations of clinical relevance, as far as data derived from an experimental mouse model can be extrapolated to human disease.

the lack of factor b leads to reduced neuronal cell death after head injury
the mortality from brain injury in this model system is approximately 5–8% within  <dig> days, as previously reported  <cit> ). there was no difference in mortality between fb-/- and fb+/+ mice. as previously described, neuronal cell death was observed in injured brains of wild-type c57bl/ <dig> mice for up to  <dig> days after closed head injury  <cit> . an increase in tunel-positive cells was detected in the injured hemispheres of fb+/+ mice within  <dig> to  <dig> hours after trauma, persisting for up to  <dig> days . the nuclear staining with 4',6'-diamino-2-phenylindole  shows the cellular morphology in adjacent sections to those assessed by tunel histochemistry. neurons were determined as the main tunel-positive cell-type by immunohistochemical staining of adjacents sections with the specific cell-marker neun . the staining of astrocytes , microglia , and endothelial cells  revealed that these resident cells in the brain are represent only a small part of tunel-positive cells, e.g. in the molecular layer of the cortex . furthermore, neurons were confirmed as the predominant tunel-positive cell-type by their typical cellular size and morphology  and to the typical neuronal layers of tunel-positive cells in the injured cortex . the data shown in figures 3and  <dig> are highly reproducible in all tissue sections and animals assessed and are representative for 2– <dig> mice of each group  per time-point assessed. these findings corroborate previously published data on neuronal apoptosis in the current and other experimental tbi models as well as in head-injured patients  <cit> . in contrast to the extent of neuronal cell death in brain-injured fb+/+ mice, the fb-/- animals showed a clear reduction in tunel-positive neurons in injured brains from  <dig> hours to  <dig> days after trauma . in addition, the evident cortical tissue destruction in brain-injured wild-type mice at  <dig> hours  appears to be structurally preserved in fb-/- mice . tunel-positive cells and extent of tissue destruction were less in the contralateral  hemisphere as compared to the injured  hemisphere at all time-points assessed, both in the knockout and the wild-type mice . these findings support the recently established concept of complement-dependent regulation of neuronal apoptosis  <cit>  and promote the in vivo significance of the alternative  pathway of complement activation in regulating the extent of secondary neurodegeneration after tbi. this is the first study, to our knowledge, which investigated exclusively the role of the alternative pathway in contributing to neuropathology after brain injury. the fb-/- mice have previously been shown to be protected from experimental demyelination in an animal model of multiple sclerosis  <cit> . the studies by nataf and colleagues support our present findings in that the genetic deficiency of factor b, which provokes the complete lack of a functional alternative complement activation pathway, plays an essential role for neuroprotection in models of autoimmune and traumatic cns injury.

upregulation of bcl- <dig> and downregulation of fas in injured fb-/- brains
posttraumatic neuronal apoptosis has been shown to be promoted by the fas-mediated extrinsic pathway and by a suppression of the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic mediator bcl- <dig> of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis  <cit> . by western blot analysis, we found a marked upregulation of protective bcl- <dig> protein levels in brain homogenates of sham-operated and head-injured fb-/- mice at  <dig> hours – and to a lesser degree at  <dig> days – after trauma, compared to fb+/+ littermates . no differences in bcl- <dig> expression between knockout and wild-type mice was seen at  <dig> h after tbi . interestingly, sham-operation alone was a sufficient trigger for inducing bcl- <dig> protein expression in the brain of fb-/- mice within  <dig> h . we have previously reported the phenomenon of increased intracerebral mediator expression by sham operation alone  such as for the anaphylatoxin c5a receptor  in sham-operated c57bl/ <dig> mice  <cit> . in the present study, it appears that the threshold for induction of bcl- <dig> in the brain of sham-operated knockout mice is lower than in wild-type mice, thus possibly contributing to increased intracerebral bcl- <dig> levels also in the brain-injured fb-/- mice. we plan to explore the pharmacological aspects of this phenomenon in future studies.

with regard to the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, a marked downregulation in fas receptor expression was seen within  <dig> hours to  <dig> days after tbi in fb-/- mice, compared to fb+/+ animals . although these data are not quantitative, the differences in staining intensity of the  <dig> kda  and  <dig> kda bands  appear more intense in the brain-injured knockout mice than in the corresponding wild-type littermates at the above-mentioned time-points . these findings suggest, but do not prove, an involvement of the alternative pathway of complement activation in regulating neuronal apoptosis after tbi by suppression of bcl- <dig> and induction of fas receptor expression in the injured brain. both aspects are critical in the regulation of post-injury neuronal apoptosis, as previously determined by other investigators in different model systems  <cit> . an experimental study on a controlled cortical impact brain injury model demonstrated that the cortical lesion volume was significantly reduced in transgenic mice with over-expression of the bcl- <dig> gene by  <dig> days after trauma, compared to wild-type littermates  <cit> . thus, bcl- <dig> was attributed an important role in the regulation of the mitochondrial  pathway of apoptosis after tbi  <cit> .

we have recently shown that the pharmacological "pan"-inhibition of complement activation at the level of the c <dig> convertases by crry-ig, a murine recombinant chimeric fusion molecule, leads to enhanced intracerebral bcl- <dig> gene and protein expression and to increased neuronal survival in the hippocampus of brain-injured mice  <cit> . similar findings were described in a model of murine autoimmune cerebritis, where the blocking of complement activation by crry-ig resulted in a significant attenuation of neuronal apoptosis  <cit> .

the data from the present study support the biological significance of the alternative pathway of complement activation in contributing to the neuropathological sequelae of tbi and provide the basis for future pharmacological studies with selective alternative pathway inhibitors, e.g. such as factor b antagonists  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present data provide first evidence of a major role of the alternative pathway of complement activation in contributing to the overall extent of posttraumatic complement activation  and to secondary neuronal cell death after brain injury . this is a fairly new and provocative notion, since all previously published studies on experimental complement inhibition in tbi models have focussed on interfering with the complement cascade at the "common junction" level of c <dig> convertases  <cit>  or further downstream in the cascade, e.g. by specific blocking of anaphylatoxin c5a or its receptor  <cit> . the hitherto underestimation of the pathophysiological role of the alternative complement pathway in the neuropathology of brain injury may be in part due to the historically established predominant role of the classical pathway in various neurological diseases  <cit> . however, the results from the present study imply that these insights may not necessarily reflect the "true" in vivo significance of the alternative complement pathway in a complex multifactorial neuroinflammatory disease, such as in the setting of tbi  <cit> . the fact that elevated factor b levels are present in the intrathecal compartment of severely head-injured patients  <cit>  further supports the concept that the pharmacological targeting of factor b may present a reasonable basis for future investigations.
