BACKGROUND
in mammals, the anterior foregut invades the surrounding splanchnic mesoderm to form the primordial lung. during embryogenesis, this bilayered structure undergoes a series of highly orchestrated morphogenetic steps to form a complex respiratory organ purported to include over  <dig> specialized cell varieties. elucidating the mechanisms that govern commitment and differentiation of these cell types has been a major challenge. the bulk of the cell types studied has been of endodermal origin. much less is known about the regulatory mechanisms that control the ontogeny and differentiation of the mesodermally-derived cell varieties.

in very broad terms, the lung mesenchyme can be divided into two histologically distinct cell populations that are detectable as early as e <dig>   <cit> . the ‘sub-epithelial mesenchymal’ cells wrap around the epithelial ducts, while the ‘sub-mesothelial mesenchymal’  cells inhabit the area between the mesothelium and the sub-epithelial mesenchymal cells  <cit> . smm is a major site of fgf <dig> expression. we and others have shown that fgf10pos cells contribute, but are not the sole source of smooth muscle  cells and lipofibroblasts   <cit> . viewed from the perspective of gene expression, mesodermal derivatives can be simply grouped into two molecularly defined cell populations; the αsmapos and αsmaneg groups. the primary αsmapos group comprises the fibroblasts in the peribronchial  and perivascular sm layers as well as interstitial αsmapos myofibroblasts. notably, the latter cells attain αsmapos status at different times during lung development. while airway and perivascular sm cells are αsmapos as early as e <dig> , interstitial fibroblasts begin to display αsma only in mid to late gestation. with that caveat in mind, in the present study we have opted to use the term ‘αsmapos cells’ in a ‘broad stroke’ to conveniently refer collectively to all cells that express this marker and not solely the ‘interstitial myofibroblasts’ noted routinely by other investigators.

generation of mesodermal cell diversity occurs concurrently with the structural development of the lung. a central player is the reciprocal communication known as epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that occur between the foregut endoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm-derived splanchnic mesenchyme. this process works on a ‘signaling, transcription factors, signaling’ algorithm . additional integral components include the extracellular matrix, structural proteins and differentiation-specific proteins. a major signaling pathway in the lung and other mammalian organs is the transforming growth factor beta  family of secreted polypeptides.

the significance of tgfβ signaling during development and disease can be hardly overstated. tgfβ is the prototype of a family of secreted dimeric peptide growth factors that includes the tgfβs, activins, inhibins, and bone morphogenetic proteins  <cit> . in vertebrates, tgfβ regulates key processes in stem cell maintenance, organogenesis, wound healing, and homeostasis. given this broad range of activity, it is not surprising that tgfβ dysregulation results in a spectrum of pathologies ranging from cancer to pulmonary fibrosis.

the tgfβ machinery has many "moving parts. the ligands are produced as ‘latent’ peptides. upon secretion and activation, all three tgfβs signal by engaging a specific receptor, composed of two related transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, called the type i and type ii tgfβ receptors   <cit> . the basic mechanism of receptor activation involves binding of the ligand to tβr <dig>  followed by recruitment of alk <dig>  recruitment triggers alk <dig> kinase activity, transducing the signal by phosphorylating and activating members of the smad family of transcription factors  <cit> .

in various tissues, tgfβ response is remarkably cell type and context dependent. it is equally true that the downstream effects of tgfβ are transduced not simply via a single target, but may involve multiple nodes. given the multicomponent nature of the pathway, there is a wide spectrum of versatility and selectivity in tgfβ biologic functions. some are ostensibly paradoxical. for example, tgfβ acts as both a cancer promoter and suppressor  <cit> . selective utilization of receptors is a potential mechanism for generating versatility in tgfβ function. tgfβ expression is thought to be ubiquitous throughout the lung with both endodermal and mesodermal cells displaying alk <dig> and tβr <dig>  elucidating the function of each receptor in specific cell types and in particular in endodermal versus mesodermal cells of the lung is a necessary step towards unlocking the precise roles of tgfβ in development and disease. attempts to define the specific role played by each of the receptors using targeted germline deletions of either tβr <dig> or alk <dig> have not been fully successful due to early embryonic lethality  <cit> . using conditional inactivation, we have shown that lack of mesodermal-specific tβr <dig> causes embryonic lethality, while endodermal tβr <dig> inactivation is not only tolerated and viable, but protects against experimentally induced fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia  <cit> . a systematic approach involving abrogation of each receptor on a cell-type specific basis has the promise of revealing the precise roles of each receptor during embryonic development.

in this study, alk <dig> was specifically inactivated in the early embryonic multipotential mesoderm that is the origin of lung mesodermal progenitors. alk5dermo <dig> mice displayed multiple abnormalities and postnatal lethality. their lungs were structurally immature , characterized by thickened mesenchymal walls around significantly reduced alveolar spaces. importantly, the studies revealed a novel role for alk5-mediated tgfβ signaling that regulates the balance between αsmapos and lif cell fate commitment and differentiation during lung development. the precise balance between these key cell populations is critical to normal lung development and its disruption underlies the pathobiology of serious pulmonary disorders.

RESULTS
mesodermal-specific alk <dig> inactivation
the localization and efficiency of loxp-dependent excision in dermo1-cre  mouse lungs has been previously reported  <cit> . dermo1-driven, cre-mediated recombination occurs early and exclusively throughout the tracheal and pulmonary mesoderm, but not in the epithelium . accordingly, we generated triple transgenic dermo1-cre;alk5flox/flox;mtmg mice  in which exon  <dig> of the alk <dig> gene is excised in early pulmonary mesodermal progenitors . over  <dig> fetuses at various embryonic stages were genotyped and analyzed .

heterozygous alk5flox/wt;dermo1-cre;mtmg mice were born alive and had no discernable abnormalities in development, growth, or reproduction. homozygous alk5flox/flox;dermo1-cre;mtmg  embryos examined at e <dig>  showed no obvious morphological defects. defects in body-wall closure in alk5dermo <dig> embryos, as previously reported  <cit> , were evident at e <dig>  . embryonic lethality occurred between e <dig>  and e <dig> . occasionally, mutant embryos with a less severe phenotype survived to birth but died immediately afterwards.

to confirm deletion of alk <dig> from the pulmonary mesoderm, expression of alk <dig>  phospho-smad <dig> , and pai- <dig> were assessed by immunoblotting. the latter is expressed by mesenchymal cells in response to canonical tgfβ signaling. compared to controls, alk <dig> was decreased by nearly 85 % , p-smad <dig> by 73 % , and pai- <dig> expression reduced by 83 %  . immunohistochemistry  for alk <dig> and pai- <dig> on e <dig>  lung sections confirmed decreased mesenchymal and intact epithelial alk <dig> immunoreactivity . while these results confirm abrogation of canonical tgfβ signaling, the source of the residual activity can be certainly attributed to intact signaling in the lung epithelium.

lung immaturity and blocked epithelial and endothelial cell differentiation in alk5dermo <dig> lungs
the lungs of e <dig> , alk5dermo <dig> embryos were smaller and poorly expanded, but the number of lobes appeared normal . the alveolar diameters were decreased and septal thicknesses increased relative to control lungs . glycogen stores, which are an epithelial marker of immature lungs  <cit> , were also increased in alk5dermo <dig> lungs . ihc using antibodies against acetylated tubulin, cc <dig>  pro-spc, and t1a  showed reduced differentiation of all four major epithelial cell types in e <dig>  alk5dermo <dig> lungs . these findings were also examined by quantitative pcr  . cumulatively, these results suggest that lung maturation and epithelial cell differentiation are delayed by mesenchymal alk <dig> inactivation.

the lung mesoderm serves as the origin of endothelial cells that form the pulmonary vasculature. flk <dig>  expressed by vascular endothelial progenitors, was reduced in e <dig>  alk5dermo <dig> lungs as was the fraction of cd34pos cells . as lung development progressed, pecam <dig>  a vascular endothelial differentiation marker, was also reduced. the distal capillary plexus adjacent to the airway epithelium was less dense compared to age-matched controls . however, the large blood vessels were intact . q-pcr of multiple vascular markers showed that in alk5dermo <dig> lungs, pecam- <dig> mrna was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , flk <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , and flt-1was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   of controls . however, mutant and control lungs had similar flt- <dig>  and vegfa  mrnas.

mesodermal-specific alk <dig> inactivation reduces the sub-mesothelial mesenchyme
structurally, the smm  <cit>  of alk5dermo <dig> lungs was smaller and more irregularly shaped compared to control lungs . anti-phospho-histone h <dig> labeling revealed fewer mitotic cells within the distal mesenchyme of mutant lungs . the smm regulates epithelial, smooth muscle, and vascular development by producing factors such as fgf <dig>  <cit> . fgf <dig> mrna in mutant lungs was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  of controls . in addition, fgf <dig> made by the mesothelium/epithelium and fgf <dig> expressed by the mesenchyme were respectively expressed at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  of controls . to assess the functional significance of the reduced fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> mrnas, we examined expression of their target genes. immunoblotting revealed decreased spry <dig> and spry <dig> in alk5dermo <dig> lungs relative to controls, confirming functionally reduced fgf <dig> signaling . similarly, there was profound decrease in the homeodomain transcription factor pitx <dig>  a major target of fgf <dig> . these data suggest that mesodermal alk <dig> inactivation reduces smm volume by decreasing overall functional fgf signaling.fig.  <dig> mesodermal progenitor-specific deletion of alk <dig> reduced the sub-mesothelial mesenchyme.  gross morphology  and hematoxylin and eosin staining  show decreased sub-mesothelial mesenchyme in alk5

inhibition of airway smooth muscle development
fgf10pos cells contribute to differentiated peribronchial smooth muscle  cells  <cit> . by ihc, layers of αsmapos pbsm were thinner in diameter and included large gaps in e <dig>  mutant lungs . however, αsma expression around large blood vessels was similar in mutant and control lungs . consistent with the ihc, q-pcr showed reduced mrna for multiple myofibroblast markers in alk5dermo <dig> lungs . these included αsma , calponin , sm-mhc , and sm22α . in addition, there was reduced mrna for both pdgfrα  and pdgfrβ . transcripts for noggin, an airway smooth muscle cell marker  <cit> , were also decreased  while those for heyl, a vascular smooth muscle marker  <cit> , were only slightly reduced . thus, the diminished αsmapos cells in alk5dermo <dig> lungs were primarily lost from the pbsm layers. in addition, there was decreased mrna for paired-homeobox transcription factor prrx <dig>  and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-c , both of which promote myofibroblast growth and differentiation . the effects of alk <dig> abrogation on αsmapos cell commitment was also assessed by analysis of pdgfrα protein , which is regulated by tnc and highly expressed on αsmapos cell precursors  <cit> . the fraction of pdgfrαpos cells surrounding the airway epithelium was significantly reduced in alk5dermo <dig> lungs , and western blot analysis confirmed the decrease in αsma and pdgfrα . consistent with this observation, phosphorylation of akt, the canonical substrate of pdgfa-activated pdgfrα , was reduced in both alk5dermo <dig> lung homogenates  and isolated primary alk5dermo <dig> mesenchymal cells . thus, alk5-mediated tgfβ signaling is required in lung αsmapos cell development, and early defects in this pathway lead to decreased populations of cells expressing αsma or pdgfrα.fig.  <dig> mesodermal alk <dig> deficiency inhibits smooth muscle development.  immunohistochemistry  showed αsma is decreased throughout lung development in alk5

lipofibroblast  hyperplasia in alk5dermo <dig> lungs
in addition to αsmapos and endothelial cells, the multipotential lung mesoderm gives rise to lifs. in the rat, lifs are detected on embryonic day e <dig>  increase during gestation, and decline after birth  <cit> . oil red o staining of alk5dermo <dig> lungs revealed overwhelmingly abundant lifs within the developing mesoderm, relative to controls . to confirm that observation, q-pcr was used to quantify the mrna for multiple lif markers, including adipocyte transcription factors pparγ and cebpα, the lipid droplet-associated adipose differentiation-related protein , and adipocyte fatty acid binding protein  <dig> . all were elevated in alk5dermo <dig> lungs . immunoblots of total alk5dermo <dig> lung homogenates confirmed that adrp, cebpα, and pparγ proteins were more abundant compared to controls. furthermore, p-akt and p-erk were decreased while pten, a tgfβ-repressed phosphatase associated with lif hyperplasia  <cit> , was increased in alk5dermo <dig> lungs . importantly, zfp <dig>  which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that regulates pparγ in pre-adipocytes  <cit> , as well as wisp <dig>  a matricellular protein that is highly expressed in adipocyte precursors  <cit> , were increased in alk5dermo <dig> lungs . these findings indicate that abrogation of alk5-mediated signaling increases lif commitment and differentiation.fig.  <dig> lipofibroblast hyperplasia in alk5

establishment of alk5-deficient mesodermal cell lines
the aggregate data presented above suggests that inactivation of alk <dig> in multipotential lung mesoderm promotes lif commitment and inhibits sm differentiation. to examine the underlying mechanisms, we isolated mesodermal cells from alk5dermo1;mtmg and alk5flox/flox;mtmg mouse lungs. these alk5–/– and alk5+/+cells were immortalized by transfection with an sv <dig> plasmid and purified by facs . tgfβ-induced smad <dig> phosphorylation was nearly absent in alk5–/– cells, confirming abrogation of alk5-mediated canonical tgfβ signaling . other mediators of tgfβ signaling were also affected. baseline p-p <dig>  p-akt and p-erk were high in alk5+/+ control cells but tgfβ stimulation minimally induced p <dig> activation in mutant cells. tgfβ also had little impact on p-akt in the mutant cells, but total akt was reduced. importantly, baseline erk phosphorylation was elevated in alk5–/– cells, and tgfβ induced a robust response in these cells compared to alk5+/+ controls . these findings indicate the critical and complex role of alk <dig> activity in the tgfβ signal transduction pathway.fig.  <dig> reduced myogenesis and increased adipogenesis in sv40-trasformed, gfp-sorted alk5

alk5-mediated tgfβ represses the lif transcription factor zfp <dig> in vitro
we also evaluated the impact of tgfβ on the isolated cells. treatment with recombinant tgfβ  initiated myogenic differentiation as assessed by increased αsma and prrx <dig> transcripts in alk5+/+ but not alk5–/– mesenchymal cells . in contrast, tnc induction by tgfβ was unaffected by alk <dig> inactivation, suggesting that its regulation is independent of alk <dig> and the canonical tgfβ pathway. conversely, alk5–/– cells displayed a significantly high rate of spontaneous adipogenic differentiation in non-induced, minimum standard culture medium . this did not occur in alk5+/+ controls, and was verified by assessing the expression of adipogenic markers. after 5 days in culture, lipogenic mediators, including adrp, cebpα and pparγ mrna, increased by  <dig>  ±  <dig> -,  <dig>  ±  <dig> -, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold, respectively in the alk5–/– cells compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig> -,  <dig>  ±  <dig> -, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold in the alk5+/+cells . likewise, zfp <dig> mrna was 11-fold higher and wisp <dig> mrna was 17-fold higher in alk5–/–cells relative to alk5+/+ cells . to determine the relationship between tgfβ and zfp <dig>  we treated alk5+/+ and alk5–/– cells with recombinant tgfβ ligand . controls were treated exactly the same with the exception of bovine serum albumin  replacing tgfβ. tgfβ repressed zfp <dig> mrna levels and this activity was dependent on alk <dig> . taken together, these data indicate a novel mechanism by which abrogation of alk5-mediated canonical tgfβ signaling, through regulation of zfp <dig>  promotes lif versus αsmapos cell differentiation in lung mesodermal cells.

the role of pdgfrα
as noted above, pdgfrα and signaling were decreased in alk5dermo <dig> lungs . although pdgfrαpos cells can differentiate into either αsmapos cells or lifs, their role in determining mesodermal commitment has not been elucidated. we therefore sought to determine whether pdgfa signaling through pdgfrα is necessary for alk <dig> to induce αsmapos cell differentiation. tgfβ is known to induce pdgfrβ; however, its role in regulating pdgfrα remains unknown. because pdgfrα is decreased in alk5dermo <dig> mutant lungs, its possible regulation by tgfβ was evaluated by tgfβ treatment  for 48 hours. controls were treated exactly the same with the exception of bsa replacing tgfβ. tgfβ increased both pdgfrα and pdgfrβ mrnas in alk5+/+ cells but not in alk5–/– cells  indicating that tgfβ regulation of pdgfrα and, hence, αsmapos cell differentiation, requires alk <dig> activity. surprisingly, pdgfrα mrna increased during spontaneous differentiation of alk5–/– cells to lifs over a 5 day period . in addition, pdgfrα protein was consistently higher in alk5–/– compared to alk5+/+ cells on both day  <dig> and day  <dig> of culture . these observations suggest the possibility of alternative or additional mechanisms that may regulate pdgfrα expression in these cells.fig.  <dig> role of pdgfrα.  quantitative pcr  analysis showed induction  of pdgfrα and pdgfrβ mrnas in response to 48 hours of tgfβ <dig> treatment only in alk5

the need for signaling through pdgfrα during αsmapos cell differentiation was examined in vitro and in vivo. application of the kinase inhibitor imatinib to alk5+/+ cells reduced the mrna for known pdgfa targets arid5b, tiparp, and schip <dig> , thereby validating its use. importantly, imatinib reduced the expression of myogenic markers  but, of the lif markers, only pparγ was strongly increased. adrp was modestly increased by higher imatinib doses . these results suggest that pdgfra inactivation in mesodermal precursors prevents αsmapos cell differentiation but is insufficient to promote lif commitment.

to confirm this finding in vivo, genetically engineered mice were generated in which pdgfrα was inactivated in mesodermal tissues by dermo1-cre. the resulting pdgfrαflox/flox;dermo1-cre mice  survived to birth at predicted mendelian ratios but were 22 % smaller than control littermates . pdgfrαdermo <dig> mutant mice also developed spina bifida as reported in mice deficient in pdgfrα-stimulated phosphatidyl-inositol 3’ kinase activity  <cit> . ihc on e <dig>  control lungs localized pdgfrα-expressing cells to the stroma and to areas surrounding the airways and blood vessels . these cells were absent or significantly reduced in pdgfradermo <dig> lungs . q-pcr showed reduced mrna for pdgfa targets, including zfand <dig>  myo1e, arid5b, tiparp, and schip <dig>  <cit> , confirming functionally repressed pdgfa signaling in pdgfrαdermo <dig> lungs . the αsmapos cell layers in mutant lungs were reproducibly thinner compared to controls, with gaps in αsma expression . q-pcr of e <dig>  pdgfradermo <dig> lungs showed decreased mrna for multiple myofibroblast markers, including prrx <dig> , sm22α , and αsma  . myofibroblast marker mrnas were similarly decreased in e <dig>  pdgfradermo <dig> lungs . similar analysis of adipogenic-related genes in pdgfradermo <dig> lungs at e <dig>  showed increased pparγ mrna but only modest increases in adrp, fabp <dig>  and cebpα . the balance between αsmapos cells and lif phenotypes in pdgfradermo <dig> lungs was less severely distorted than those in alk5dermo <dig> mice. in sum, these data support a model whereby alk5-mediated tgfβ signaling regulates αsmapos versus lif cell differentiation only partly through the pdgfa/pdgfrα pathway and that inhibition of this pathway is insufficient to promote lif differentiation.fig.  <dig> mesodermal progenitor-specific deletion of pdgfra.  immunohistochemistry showed pdgfrα  is lost in the lung mesenchyme and αsma  is decreased in e <dig>  pdgfra

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides genetic, histologic, and molecular evidence that mesodermal inactivation of alk <dig> in the mouse lung restricts αsmapos cell fate and promotes lif differentiation. in this context, alk <dig> meets the definition of a molecular binary switch that functions in determination and subsequent specialization of at least two key lung mesodermal cell lineages.

an early morphological phenotype of alk5dermo <dig> embryonic lungs is the reduced physical size of the smm. this was associated with decreased proliferation of the lung mesoderm and reduction in fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> is expressed by both the mesothelium and the epithelial layers in the lung  <cit> . dermo1-cre is not known to be active in the mesothelium, although the origin of some mesothelial cells may be traced to the pulmonary mesoderm  <cit> . whether reduced fgf <dig> is due to direct impact of alk <dig> inactivation or a result of mesoderm-mesothelial cross communication remains unknown. fgf <dig> signaling through fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> is both necessary and sufficient for smm growth. although alk <dig> inactivation modestly decreased fgf <dig>  pitx <dig>  a homeodomain transcription factor that is induced by fgf <dig>  was strongly inhibited . smm volume is profoundly sensitive to fgf <dig> signaling, being entirely absent from fgf9–/– lungs and enlarged in fgf <dig> gain-of-function mutants  <cit> . the reduced smm size and mitotic index indicate that alk <dig> is required for either mesothelial fgf <dig> expression or fgf <dig> responsiveness. ligand-dependent tβrii signaling has been shown to regulate fgf9- and pitx2-mediated cell proliferation in the palatal mesenchyme  <cit> . our observations suggest that alk <dig> may similarly mediate tgfβ-mediated control of fgf <dig> signaling within the smm.

the alk5dermo <dig> lungs also displayed defective epithelial differentiation. as dermo <dig> is exclusively mesodermal, the abnormalities in epithelial cell differentiation presumably represent altered mesenchymal regulation of epithelial progenitors. previous studies have suggested that fgf <dig>  which is reduced in alk5dermo <dig> lungs, participates in mesenchymal-epithelial cross-talk  <cit> . alternatively, tgfβ also regulates epithelial differentiation by altering the composition of the underlying matrix  <cit> . finally, tunelpos cells were found scattered in the parenchyma of late stage  alk5dermo <dig> lungs . although these cells are not localized to the airways, the possibility that some of the changes in airway gene expression may be due to increased apoptosis cannot be presently ruled out.

the loss of alk <dig> in mesodermal progenitors also disrupted pulmonary vasculogenesis. flk <dig>  also known as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  <dig>  is expressed by endothelial progenitors  <cit>  and was strongly decreased in e <dig>  alk5dermo <dig> lungs. this likely accounts for the simplified vasculature observed in e <dig>  mutant lungs. since dermo <dig> may not be expressed in endothelial progenitors  <cit> , it is unclear whether alk <dig> directly participates in vascular endothelial cell commitment. in addition, reduced fgf <dig> in alk5dermo <dig> lungs might also contribute to the observed vascular phenotype. increased fgf <dig> in vivo is sufficient to expand the network of tie2-lacz and pecampos cells through stimulation of undifferentiated mesenchyme and/or vascular progenitor cells  <cit> .

the key finding of the present study is that inactivation of alk <dig> inhibits αsmapos and promotes lif differentiation, both in vivo and in cultured lung mesodermal cell lines. markers of myofibroblast differentiation, including αsma, sm22α, and calponin, were reduced, while mediators of lipogenic commitment, such as adrp, were robustly increased. the mechanism underlying this phenotype is complex. since tgfβ signaling is known to induce αsmapos cell differentiation, its inhibition is readily explicable by alk <dig> deficiency. in addition, fgf10pos cells are known to contribute to αsmapos cells during lung development  <cit> . fgf <dig> mrna was reduced as was the physical size of smm, the site of fgf10pos cells. in contrast to this finding, we had previously found increased fgf <dig> mrna and shh signaling in mesodermally-targeted tβr2dermo <dig> lungs  <cit> . the discrepancy between the previous and present observations on fgf <dig> provides an excellent illustration of differential tgfβ signaling via receptor selectivity as described in the background section. thus, receptor selectivity  represents an important mechanism by which tgfβ can impose a vast spectrum of physiologic changes on different  tissues and cell types. in the present study, when the observation on reduced fgf <dig> levels in the alk5dermo <dig> lungs is combined with a diminished mitotic cell index in the smm compartment, the data suggest a decreased number of fgf10pos cells and hence reduced αsmapos cell differentiation. consistent with this conclusion, histological analysis of alk5dermo <dig> lungs revealed reduced αsmapos cell differentiation in the pbsm but not in perivascular smooth muscle cells . it is unclear whether pbsm cells and vascular smooth muscle cells have common or distinct developmental origins.

pdgfrα is also expressed by αsmapos progenitors and was similarly and profoundly reduced in alk5dermo <dig> lungs. its functional abrogation was confirmed by reduced phosphorylation of akt, its principle intracellular substrate . our study showed that the tgfβ-alk <dig> axis regulates pdgfrα mrna expression . therefore, it was surprising to find that pdgfrα mrna increased during spontaneous differentiation of alk5–/– cells to lifs . it is likely that in these isolated cells alternative or additional mechanisms may exist which regulate pdgfrα expression, independent of the tgfβ-alk <dig> axis. one potential mechanism may be increased spontaneous phosphorylation of erk found in alk5–/– cells compared to alk5+/+cells and alk5dermo <dig> lungs . the underlying cause of increased p-erk in cells lacking alk <dig> activity is outside the scope of the present study, but is being currently investigated in separate studies. what remains firmly established from these in vitro studies is that inhibition of pdgfrα by imatinib reduced expression of myofibroblast markers but did not fully promote lif differentiation; of the lipogenic genes, only pparγ was increased. this finding was validated by genetic targeting of pdgfrα in vivo . inactivation of pdgfrα in early mesodermal progenitors  robustly inhibited the expression of myofibroblast-specific genes , while, compared to alk5dermo <dig> lungs, the impact on lif differentiation was subtle, despite strong activation of pparγ in cultured cells. thus, while pdgfrα is required for full expression of the myofibroblast-specific gene battery, its absence is capable of initiating, but not completing, the lif differentiation program.

lifs are critical regulators of alveologenesis and assimilate and transfer neutral lipids to adjacent type ii cells, thereby facilitating surfactant formation  <cit> . lif commitment may be favored by increased expression of pten, a phosphatase that regulates the fate of mesodermal progenitors . this finding recapitulates our previous study in which dermo1-cre-mediated inactivation of pten profoundly reduced adrp  <cit> . pten was originally identified as a negatively regulated target of tgfβ signaling  <cit> .

based on the collective observations in this study we propose a model whereby multiple signaling pathways, controlled by alk5-mediated tgfβ signaling, converge on transcriptional factors that regulate the cell lineage determination of two key mesodermal specialized cell types . the two major transcription factor targets of this process include the adipogenic zinc finger transcription factor zfp <dig>  and the myogenic transcription factor prrx <dig>  activation of zfp <dig> through knockdown of zfp <dig>  its negative regulator, is capable of altering mesodermal cell fate from osteogenic to lipogenic lineage  <cit> . we found increased lifs in alk5dermo <dig> lungs associated with increased zfp <dig> mrna. likewise, zfp <dig> increased robustly in cultured alk5–/– cells undergoing spontaneous lif differentiation . importantly, tgfβ <dig> strongly repressed zfp <dig>  and only in presence of functional alk <dig> . thus, while alk <dig> activity is required for αsmapos cell lineage commitment, its inactivation de-represses zfp <dig> favoring early lif lineage commitment. in support of this conclusion, we found profoundly increased expression of wisp <dig>  known to be expressed at high levels in committed adipocyte precursors. in contrast, prrx <dig> is a mesodermal transcription factor  <cit>  that promotes differentiation of mesenchymal precursors into αsmapos cells. prrx <dig> inhibits adipogenesis while its stable knockdown enhances adipogenesis, as shown by increased pparγ, cebpα, and fabp <dig> expression  <cit> . in alk5dermo <dig> lungs, prrx <dig> decreased as zfp <dig> increased, indicating a key mechanism by which alk <dig> repression facilitates lif commitment while inhibiting αsmapos cell differentiation.

in conclusion, these data establish that alk <dig> has a regulatory role in the control of early mesodermal progenitor commitment between two alternative cell lineages. this role is consistent with previous in vitro studies wherein genome-wide pathway analysis identified members of the tgfβ superfamily as modulators of adipocyte/myocyte differentiation  <cit> . αsmapos cell determination is regulated by tgfβ signaling and requires further signaling by fgf <dig> and pdgfrα. in the wild type multipotential mesoderm, activation of the αsmapos cell pathway, mediated by the transcription factor prrx <dig> also limits the ontogeny of lifs. blocking alk5-mediated tgfβ signaling in alk5dermo <dig> mesoderm inhibited αsmapos cell differentiation and increased  the expression of zfp <dig>  the key lif transcription factor  <cit> . therefore, it appears that, while αsmapos cell lineage is actively determined by alk5-mediated tgfβ signaling, lif determination represents a default position on a biological binary switch. this means that lif can be activated only when αsmapos-promoting stimuli are diminished or eliminated.
