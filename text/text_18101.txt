BACKGROUND
bacterial pathogens exploit host niches using strategies that block or modify host defense pathways. one such strategy employed by the gram-negative bacterium salmonella enterica, is the translocation of effector proteins into the host cell through a type three secretion system . s. enterica serovar typhimurium  has two t3sss encoded within salmonella pathogenicity island- <dig>  and spi- <dig> that facilitate invasion and intracellular survival within host cells  <cit> . the assembly of the t3ss is complex, involving the formation of membrane channels in the bacterial inner and outer membrane, and a terminal translocon that forms a pore in host membranes.

both spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> encode a distinct group of chaperones that bind to their cognate cargo proteins to coordinate t3ss assembly and secretion of effectors. virulence chaperones belong to one of three defined classes  <cit> : class i chaperones bind to single  or multiple  effectors, class ii chaperones interact with translocon components, and class iii chaperones partner with apparatus components. among each of the different classes, chaperones share structural similarity yet their amino acid sequence can be poorly conserved. as such, many chaperones have been first identified based on low sequence identity with previously characterized proteins, and by shared physical properties such as isoelectric point . class i chaperones tend to be small proteins  with acidic pi, and function as dimers adopting a horseshoe-like shape  <cit> . class ii chaperones also form dimers but do not have an acidic pi, which reflects a different interaction surface required for substrate binding  <cit> .

in addition to directing secretion events, chaperone-cargo pairs can function as regulatory proteins for t3ss gene expression  <cit> . the flgn chaperone interacts with flgk-flgl to form a repressive complex that inhibits expression of late flagellar genes  <cit> . the yersinia virulence plasmid encodes the chaperone sycd  that aids in the secretion of the translocon components yopb and yopd, the latter of which is responsible for establishing a negative feedback loop to prevent effector gene expression at early stages of infection  <cit> . as sycd is required for yopd stability in the cytosol, both chaperone and cargo are necessary for proper coordination of yop expression.

in s. enterica, over twenty effectors secreted by the spi- <dig> t3ss have been identified yet the full complement of virulence chaperones involved in their secretion remains to be identified or functionally analyzed. to date, three virulence chaperones have been characterized; we showed that srca chaperones the effectors ssel and pipb <dig> and binds to the t3ss atpase ssan  <cit> . the sscb chaperone directs the secretion of ssef  <cit> , and the class ii chaperone, ssea, is responsible for the secretion of the putative translocon platform protein sseb and one of the two translocon proteins, ssed, but not ssec  <cit> . comparative sequence analysis of spi- <dig> identified a putative chaperone gene called ssca <cit>  but its function had yet to be demonstrated. in light of these findings, we set out to identify and characterize the chaperone involved in secretion of the ssec translocon protein, with an a priori focus on the ssca gene in spi- <dig>  in this study we demonstrate that ssca interacts with ssec and is required for its secretion but is dispensable for secretion of the other translocon components ssed and sseb. both ssca and ssec were required for fitness in infected mice and in vitro macrophage infection assays.

RESULTS
identification of ssca as a chaperone for ssec
ssca was previously predicted to be a chaperone based on comparisons to other t3ss-associated chaperones and therefore we prioritized it for analysis  <cit> . ssca is an ~ <dig> kda protein that has 46% sequence identity to sycd, a translocon chaperone in yersinia. using the sycd crystal structure as a model , the secondary structure prediction for ssca  <cit>  showed a solely α-helical protein consisting of eight α-helices and a large tetratricopeptide repeat  domain from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> . this helical structure is similar to that found in sycd  <cit>  while the tpr domain has been shown in mutational studies and structural work to be involved in cargo binding for class ii chaperones  <cit> . based on this structural comparison, we aimed to further characterize ssca as a potential class ii chaperone in the spi- <dig> t3ss.

ssca interacts with the translocon protein ssec
chaperones exert their biological function in t3ss export through a physical interaction with cargo proteins. because the class ii chaperone ssea binds the translocon components sseb and ssed but not ssec, this suggested that another chaperone interacts with ssec. the structural similarity of ssca to sycd made this protein a logical candidate. to test this hypothesis we immunoprecipitated ssca-flag from bacterial cells and analyzed the co-precipitated proteins by western blot with anti-ssec antiserum. ssec was pulled down only in the salmonella strain expressing ssca-flag and not from control lysates generated from untagged wild type cells . to verify this interaction, we performed a reciprocal co-ip by pulling down ssec-flag and showing co-precipitation of ssca-his <dig> in the eluted protein fraction . to examine the specificity of the ssca-ssec interaction, we tested whether ssca-flag could immunoprecipitate other members of the translocon apparatus, including sseb and ssed, which it did not . these data indicated that ssca interacted with ssec, but not the other translocon proteins.

ssca is necessary for secretion of ssec
to determine if the interaction between ssca and ssec was necessary for ssec secretion, we performed an in vitro secretion assay using wild type and Δssca under conditions that activate expression and activity of the spi- <dig> t3ss. the secreted protein fraction from the culture supernatant of both wild type s. typhimurium and Δssca was immunoblotted for the translocon proteins sseb, ssec, and ssed using specific antisera. the ssca mutant failed to secrete ssec as this protein was absent from the secreted protein fraction despite abundant levels in the bacterial cytoplasmic fraction . ssec was detected in both the secreted protein and cytoplasmic fractions from wild type salmonella and deletion of ssca had no demonstrable effect on the secretion of sseb or ssed . to verify this phenotype, we complemented the Δssca mutant by transforming it with a plasmid to restore ssca expression. this lead to detectable levels of ssec in the secreted protein fraction, albeit to lower levels than wild type , likely due to the increased copy number of ssca relative to its ssec cargo.

ssec and ssca are required for fitness during infection
given that ssca was required for secretion of the ssec translocon component, we measured the impact on bacterial fitness following the deletion of ssec and ssca. deletion of either ssca or ssec reduced the ability of bacteria to survive in raw <dig>  macrophages compared to wild type . the number of intracellular bacteria between  <dig> h and  <dig> h after infection was decreased to 10% of wild type in the ssec mutant, and to 50% of wild type in the ssca mutant. to determine whether similar phenotypes could be observed in animal infections, mice were orally gavaged with a mixed inoculum containing equal proportions of wild type and mutant bacteria and the competitive fitness was determined  <dig> days after infection in the spleen, liver and cecum. the competitive indices for both ssec and ssca mutant strains was below  <dig>  and were statistically significant . the ci for the ssca mutant was  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  . values for the ssec mutant were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  . these results indicated that both ssec and ssca are critical for infection of macrophages and for competitive fitness in animals.

discussion
protein-chaperone interactions are essential for t3ss function because they coordinate the delivery and secretion of substrate cargo. class ii virulence chaperones are particularly important since they direct translocon secretion as a prerequisite step for the proper delivery of all subsequent effectors into the host cell. given the modest sequence similarity between the yersinia class ii virulence chaperone sycd and ssca, we analyzed ssca as the potential chaperone for the ssec translocon in the salmonella spi- <dig> t3ss. the structure of sycd shows a crescent shape molecule with the concave face possessing protein interaction sites that are common between sycd and ssca   <cit> . the shigella class ii chaperone ipgc possesses a similar structure with the concave face binding an amino acid region of its cognate cargo ipad  <cit> , suggesting that a common cargo-binding region may exist among class ii virulence chaperones.

using protein-protein interaction studies and secretion assays we demonstrated that ssca is the class ii virulence chaperone for ssec and showed that this interaction is important for salmonella pathogenicity as deletion of either ssca or ssec lead to similar attenuated phenotypes in mouse infections. as documented previously, effectors can be secreted to the cell surface of the bacteria in the absence of a functional translocon, however delivery of effector proteins into host cells requires an assembled translocon apparatus  <cit> . interestingly, the ssec mutant had a more pronounced negative effect on replication in raw <dig>  cells suggesting an additional role for ssec that does not depend on its secretion, or that a very small number of bacteria assemble a functional translocon in the absence of the ssca chaperone, allowing for some measure of phenotype recovery in vitro. this latter possibility was suggested for yersinia lcrh point mutants that had reduced secretion of translocon proteins but retained some ability to intoxicate host cells from a minimal number of t3ss  <cit> . in our system, we find this possibility unlikely because we found no evidence for ssec secretion in the absence of ssca chaperone even for highly concentrated samples, and the attenuation level of the ssca and ssec mutants was similar in animal infections.

macrophage replication assays
raw <dig>  cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  cells were seeded  <dig> h prior to infection into 24-well plates at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well. overnight cultures of bacteria were washed with pbs, diluted in dmem/10% fbs, and used to infect macrophages at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> for  <dig> min at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  infected cells were washed three times with pbs and the media was replaced with dmem/10% fbs/ <dig> μg/ml gentamicin for  <dig>  h to kill extracellular bacteria. cells were then washed twice with pbs and incubated for  <dig> h in dmem/10% fbs with <dig> μg/ml gentamicin. at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after infection, the cells were washed twice with pbs then lysed with 1% triton x- <dig>   <dig> % sds in pbs to release intracellular bacteria. colony forming units  were determined by plating serially-diluted lysates onto lb agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics. experiments were performed twice independently using  <dig> technical replicates per assay.
