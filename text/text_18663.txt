BACKGROUND
microrna  profiling from plasma or serum is emerging as a minimally invasive source of disease-specific biomarker signatures . unlike other nucleic acids, circulating mirnas are resistant to degradation  <cit>  and can be differentially expressed according to disease state . since the relatively low numbers of mirnas may simultaneously regulate disparate gene networks  <cit> , mirna patterns can be easier to analyze than global gene signatures. however, accurately identifying circulating mirna disease biomarkers is highly dependent on pre-analytical variables such as sample type and collection, processing, storage, and rna isolation method . for instance, recent studies have demonstrated that standard  plasma and hemolysis can mask true disease biomarkers through elevated blood cell-derived mirna levels  <cit> .

characterizing host-encoded mirnas differentially observed following exposure to highly infectious category a pathogens such as ebola virus, lassa fever virus, or bacillus anthracis could be used to prevent disease transmission and improve patient outcomes. however, biomarker discovery from these agents is complicated by the limited number of animal studies available and by highly restricted access to these samples. in addition, these pathogens must be inactivated by radiological, thermal, or chemical means before removal from biocontainment suites  <cit> . of these methods, chemical inactivation with a guanidinium-phenol-based solution such as trizol/tri reagent or equivalent is convenient for viruses as it works immediately, does not require specialized equipment, and is compatible with multiple tissue types  <cit> . trizol is also routinely used for rna isolation from clinical samples with alcohol precipitation, but overnight incubation and extended centrifugation are recommended to enhance mirna yield  <cit> . more rapid column-based purification kits evolved from this method, and historically most mirna studies have used either the ambion mirvana or qiagen mirneasy kits . samples can also be lysed with trizol and purified via spin column in a hybrid approach  <cit> . however, inconsistencies in mirna yield and sample-to-sample variance, dependent on rna extraction, have been reported  <cit> . also, at low cell densities, mirna isolation using trizol significantly decreased the recovery of sequences with stable secondary structure and low gc content  <cit> . consequently, extraction methodologies must be optimized for each sample type and application  <cit> .

in this study, we initially evaluated five commercially available spin column-based rna isolation kits for purification of trizol-inactivated nonhuman primate  plasma samples. rna recovery was assessed using rt-pcr assays targeting synthetic spike-in rna sequences as well as selected endogenous mirnas. glycogen and linear acrylamide were investigated as nucleic acid co-precipitants since rna yields from cell-free samples such as plasma are low  <cit> . minimum plasma volumes were determined for mirnome expression profiling, and optimized extraction parameters were used in a pilot study utilizing archived plasma samples from one nhp infected with ebola virus.

RESULTS
healthy nonhuman primate  plasma sample characterization
previous studies have shown that blood cell contamination can artificially inflate mirna expression levels  <cit> , so plasma samples must be tested for hemolysis. for the rna extraction protocols tested here, we used a pooled plasma sample from three healthy nhps. two successive centrifugation steps removed the majority of platelets in the samples; a hematology analyzer measured the platelet count of twice-centrifuged plasma as  <dig>  cells/μl, and hemoglobin content at  <dig>  g/l. these values indicate that the plasma sample was platelet-poor and not hemolyzed. lack of hemolysis-dependent mirna elevation suggested minimal blood cell contamination and negligible impact on mirna expression changes.

qiagen kits yielded best mirna recovery
selective elution of rna < 200 nt  can reduce mirna recovery and introduce experimental bias  <cit> , so manufacturers’ protocols were modified for optimal isolation of total rna . since extracted rna could not be measured spectrophotometrically or with an agilent bioanalyzer , kit performance was evaluated using individual mircury lna real-time pcr assays . we used three exiqon synthetic spike-in sequences, designed to mimic mirnas with short sequence lengths and gc content ranging from 43-50%  <cit> , for preliminary evaluation of mirna recovery. in addition, we chose seven endogenous mirna sequences based on previously published data shown in table  <dig>  specifically, these sequences showed consistent abundance and persistence in plasma samples. both blood cell-derived  <cit>  and circulating species were selected to assess mirna recovery.table  <dig>

monitoring extraction of these seven endogenous and three spike-in sequences extracted from  <dig> separate aliquots of the pooled plasma sample showed increased rna yields from the qiagen rneasy and mirneasy kits compared to the other three protocols tested . on average, these kits enabled mirna detection at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  cycles before the ambion, exiqon, and zymo kits, respectively . rna extracted using the qiagen kits also resulted in detection of the seven mirna sequences in  <dig> of  <dig> technical replicates. in contrast, the other kits demonstrated varying recoveries of lower-abundance mirna species. of note, the ambion mirvana kit resulted in unisp <dig> detection in  <dig> of  <dig> technical replicates, and hsa-mir-205-5p was not detected in any plasma samples. thus, we downselected to the qiagen rneasy and mirneasy kits for subsequent testing.table  <dig>

phase separation decreases sample-to-sample variance
separation of the aqueous phase after trizol lysis may lead to reduction in mirna yields due to extra sample manipulation and possible sample loss. since the zymo direct-zol kit does not require phase separation prior to column purification, we investigated non-centrifuged  plasma-trizol lysate as input to the spin columns. a comparison of the recovery of the spike-in sequences unisp <dig>  unisp <dig>  and unisp <dig> showed no statistically significant differences in the means obtained for the two qiagen kits . however, unisp <dig> was not detected in  <dig> of  <dig> monophase samples obtained with the rneasy kit. also, we observed a trend of lower measurement variability with extractions using the aqueous phase , so subsequent tests used this as input to the two qiagen kits.figure  <dig>

addition of glycogen as co-precipitant improves mirna recovery
glycogen or linear acrylamide is a common co-precipitant for enhanced rna recovery  <cit> . preliminary testing using synthetic spike-in sequences showed that the addition of these carriers improved short rna recovery . linear acrylamide decreased the mean cq by  <dig>  using the rneasy kit  but did not improve cq values relative to the no carrier control with the mirneasy kit. glycogen addition improved detection by  <dig>  cq earlier, on average, for both kits . while differences between the kits were not significant, the mirneasy kit with glycogen showed a trend of decreased variability. the addition of glycogen decreased cq for all mirnas tested by an average of  <dig>  , and appeared to reduce variability for the higher-abundance sequences. thus the mirneasy kit, with glycogen carrier, was used for further experimentation using seven endogenous mirnas .figure  <dig>

mirna extraction efficiency decreases with plasma volume
one significant limitation of studies using clinical specimens  is restricted sample collection. here, we evaluated mirna recovery efficiencies using different starting volumes of nhp plasma to determine the lowest volume that could be used for mirna profiling. recovery of both spike-in and endogenous mirna sequences from a range of input plasma volumes showed significantly higher exogenous rna expression levels in the water-only control  compared to those obtained from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 50 μl plasma .figure  <dig> 
mirna recovery from decreasing amounts of plasma input. the impact of plasma volume on the recovery of  exogenous rna sequences and  endogenous mirnas was evaluated using real-time rt-pcr. plasma samples were diluted in water to 50 μl and processed with the qiagen mirneasy mini kit. in , three synthetic sequences of different amounts were spiked into the samples and measured in six technical replicates. significance compared to the water-only control was determined using a linear mixed effects model, **** = p <  <dig> . endogenous mirnas were not detected in any water-only controls .



expression levels decreased with plasma volume  for the endogenous mirnas assayed . the water-only  negative controls showed no observable contamination, while all seven mirnas were detected from 5 μl of plasma eluted in 50 μl water after column clean-up. however, pcr technical replicates showed the absence of target in 50% of the lowest abundance hsa-mir-205-5p  and in 10% of hsa-mir-423-3p . consequently, subsequent mirna profiling experiments used 50 μl of plasma.

evaluation of mirna extraction methodology for mirnome profiling using archived plasma from one ebola virus-challenged nhp
we next evaluated the optimized mirna extraction protocol using archived rhesus macaque plasma samples from one ebola virus-infected nhp. mirna profiling was conducted on two separate plasma samples from one animal collected at day  <dig> and day  <dig> following exposure to aerosolized virus. using raw cq values and prior to any normalization steps,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirna sequences were detected at cq cutoffs of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. these sequences were detected in at least one timepoint and in at least one pcr technical replicate.

further analysis confirmed the presence of  <dig> of the  <dig> unique mirnas  included in the exiqon ready-to-use human panel i + ii v <dig> r in at either day  <dig> or day  <dig>  of these,  <dig> sequences were uniquely present at time of death, while one mirna was novel to day  <dig> . overall, a comparison of the mirna profiles for both days  revealed  <dig> sequences significantly up- or down-regulated  between pre-infection and time of death .figure  <dig> 
mirna changes in one rhesus macaque following exposure to aerosolized ebola virus. plasma samples from a single nhp challenged with aerosolized ebola virus were processed using the optimized mirna extraction protocol. individual mirnas were quantified using the exiqon microrna ready-to-use pcr human panel i + ii v <dig> r. twenty-five mirna sequences  were significantly altered between virus exposure and time of death. orange circles indicate upregulated mirnas, while blue circles specify downregulated sequences. a paired t-test using three pcr technical replicates at each timepoint  was used to identify differentially expressed mirnas in these datasets.



interestingly, the proportion of plasma mirna sequences detected  parallels the percentage of rhesus macaque sequences that are identical to human . as well, sequences reported to be potentially affected by trizol isolation  <cit>  were represented in our dataset .

discussion
numerous pre-analytical variables in cell-free blood can significantly impact apparent mirna profiles. for example, while the mirna spectra in both plasma and serum are highly correlated  <cit> , the use of plasma can avoid clotting-triggered release of mirnas that can obscure disease-specific sequences  <cit> . similarly, for plasma, edta is the preferred anticoagulant as heparin can inhibit pcr  <cit>  while sodium citrate can dilute plasma and cause hemolysis  <cit> . blood samples must also be processed within  <dig> hour of collection  <cit> , and additional centrifugation is required to produce platelet-poor plasma. using platelet-depleted plasma substantially decreases blood cell-associated mirnas, preserves relevant species in circulation, and reduces the variance in expression levels  <cit> . however, blood cell rupture can also inflate associated mirna levels so hemolysis must be checked with a hematology analyzer prior to rna extraction  <cit> , or possibly after pcr by calculating the difference between mirnas unaffected and affected by hemolysis -cq)  <cit> . overall, these factors necessitate consistent and high efficiency extraction protocols for reliable profiling of mirnas in disease states.

multiple kits and methodologies are currently available for plasma mirna isolation. however, samples containing category a pathogens must be inactivated, typically using trizol ls or similar guanidinium and phenol solutions, prior to removal from biosafety level - <dig> and bsl- <dig> biocontainment suites  <cit> . while standard rna extraction from trizol can improve mirna yield and decrease interassay variability compared to column-based kits  <cit> , this method is time-consuming and highly dependent on operator skill. instead, we chose to optimize trizol-treated plasma lysate as the input to five column-based rna purification kits. manufacturers’ protocols were modified where necessary to isolate total rna, as expression profiling using only the small rna fraction  was shown to be inferior to using total rna, with 65-88% apparent expression loss after small rna enrichment  <cit> . based on rt-pcr assays for spiked-in and endogenous sequences, the qiagen rneasy and mirneasy kits performed best. both enabled mirna detection  <dig>  cycles earlier, on average, than the closest competitor. all kit protocols facilitated quick and easy rna isolation, but the zymo direct-zol kit, which takes plasma-trizol lysate without phase separation as input, took significantly less time to complete. we tested this monophase input with the qiagen rneasy and mirneasy kits to decrease extraction time, but observed greater variability in mirna expression. we therefore recommend phase separation for mirna profiling studies.

plasma contains very low levels of rna, so carrier molecules such as yeast rna, glycogen, or linear acrylamide can be included to improve mirna recovery and extraction reproducibility  <cit> . results here showed that glycogen was a superior carrier, enhancing mirna detection ~3-fold compared to extractions with no carrier or with linear acrylamide. interestingly, linear acrylamide did not improve rna recovery when used with the qiagen mirneasy kit, but did increase mirna yield with the rneasy kit. while the use of biologically-derived glycogen could potentially interfere with downstream analyses  <cit> , no amplification was observed using endogenous mirna primer sets with no reverse transcriptase controls .

we also tested the effect of decreasing the initial plasma amount on mirna profiling. the use of low plasma volumes is particularly relevant in studies with restricted human or nhp clinical samples. nhp studies are usually limited in animal number due to ethical reasons as well as the costs of care and biocontainment. repeated or large volume blood collection may also become problematic as the disease progresses. further, several recent studies have established that input plasma volumes over 200 μl may confound mirna profiling due to spin column clogging or polymerase inhibitor carryover  <cit> . in one study, reducing plasma input volume from 200 μl to 50 μl improved the detection of endogenous hsa-mir-16-5p threefold, supporting the argument for lower sample input volumes  <cit> . here, we examined differences in plasma mirnas for sample volumes from  <dig> to 50 μl. these results showed that even 5 μl of plasma significantly decreased recovery of exogenous rna. this may be attributed to rt or pcr inhibition due to the carryover of plasma components, as spin column clogging from such a low sample volume is unlikely, and the low amounts of rna recovered argue against reagent limitation during cdna synthesis. seven plasma mirnas, spanning a range of abundances, were detected in all sample volumes tested. however, the identification of lower-abundance mirnas from very low plasma volumes may be compromised. based on these findings, we recommend mirna profiling from 50 μl of plasma. once suitable mirna biomarkers have been identified and validated, it may be possible to use minimal sample volumes if mirna abundance is not expected to be low.

as a proof of concept, we used this extraction methodology with archived plasma samples from an unrelated study of nhps exposed to aerosolized ebola virus  <cit> . we chose the lna-based exiqon platform because of its demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for clinical samples with low mirna abundance  <cit> . with a cq cutoff of  <dig>   <dig>  of the  <dig> unique mirna sequences were detected in at least on pcr replicate and in either timepoint. this number is close to the reported percentage of rhesus macaque sequences that are identical to human mirnas, which is  <dig> %   <cit> . the number of mirnas detected from  <dig> μl plasma is also comparable to the number of mirnas identified from  <dig> μl of starting material assayed with an older version of the exiqon panel  <cit> . both of these results are in contrast to a similar study using  <dig> μl of pre-amplified plasma, where at most  <dig> mirnas  profiled with the taqman array human microrna a+b cards were recognized  <cit> .

the level of mirna representation from the exiqon panels suggests that this method may circumvent trizol-associated loss of certain mirnas. this selective recovery from using trizol for mirna isolation from low numbers of cells was reported for sequences with low gc content and stable secondary structure, such as hsa-mir-141-3p, -193a-3p, -301a-3p, -200a-3p, -15a-5p, -324-5p, -106b-5p, -34a-5p, -21-5p, -20a-5p, -19b-3p, -29b-3p  <cit> . mirnas reportedly unaffected by trizol extraction include those from the let- <dig> family, hsa-mir-200c-3p, -29a-3p, and -25-3p. the authors postulated that small rnas need to be carried by longer transcripts during the precipitation step of non-column-based trizol extraction. structured, gc-rich mirnas likely base-pair less efficiently to these longer rna sequences and are therefore lost during the purification process. our method aimed to avoid biases in mirna recovery by adding an rna carrier and by using spin columns instead of liquid phase precipitation. these findings indicate that our method, and the exiqon panels, are well-suited for mirna profiling from low volumes of frozen plasma. in a preliminary investigation using plasma from one rhesus macaque, a comparison of the mirnas expressed at day  <dig> and day  <dig> post-exposure to aerosolized ebola virus identified  <dig> differentially expressed sequences. while the biological and statistical relevance of these sequences is under study, the results demonstrate that the mirna extraction and profiling methods chosen are suitable for potential biomarker discovery. pending confirmation using archived samples from the same nhp cohort, differentially expressed mirna sequences may be used to construct an ebola virus mirna signature of infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we present an optimized rna extraction protocol for trizol-inactivated plasma samples. we evaluated five commercially available spin column-based kits for the isolation of total rna from trizol-lysed nonhuman primate  plasma samples. the qiagen mirneasy mini kit, used with the aqueous phase of 50 μl plasma co-purified with 5 μg of glycogen, yielded the highest mirna recovery. we verified this protocol using archived plasma from one rhesus macaque exposed to aerosolized ebola virus. preliminary findings from two plasma collection timepoints indicate that this method can be used for robust mirna profiling from low sample volumes.
