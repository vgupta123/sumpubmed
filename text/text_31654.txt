BACKGROUND
during development of the central nervous system a variety of different cell-types need to be generated. the three major brain cell types, neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, arise from neural progenitor cells. neurons are the first cell type to be generated, starting soon after formation of the neuroectoderm at mid-gestation, and astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are born only shortly before birth and continuing into the postnatal period. the mechanisms by which neural stem cells transition from a neuron- to an astrocyte-generating progenitor are only partially understood, but secreted growth factors are known to play a role in this process. for example, multiple bone morphogenetic proteins , members of the tgf-beta super family, and their receptors are abundantly expressed in the developing brain, starting as early as  <dig>  days post coitum   <cit> . in vitro, bmps were shown to promote the generation of astrocytes  <cit> , and in vivo, shown to promote astrocyte formation at the expense of oligodendrocytes  <cit> . in particular, bmp2/ <dig> are known to enhance astrogliogenesis and to inhibit neurogenesis through induction of the inhibitory basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor genes id1id <dig>  and hes <dig> which antagonize the proneural gene ngn <dig> <cit> . however, bmp2/ <dig> has also been shown to promote neuronal differentiation in the cortex  <cit> .

it is becoming increasingly evident that the regulation of genes involved in brain development occurs not just at the level of the expression of activating and inhibiting transcription factors, but also at the epigenetic level, in the covalent modification of chromatin  <cit> . core histones can be methylated, phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and acetylated, to name just the best-known chemical groups involved, and these small moieties regulate the chromatin structure and subsequent gene expression. acetylation of the ε-amino groups of lysine residues in the amino-termini of core histones by histone acetyltransferases  leads to relaxation of chromatin conformation, resulting in transcriptional activation  <cit> . conversely, histone deacetylation increases chromatin compaction and thereby reduces accessibility of transcription factors to the dna. deacetylation is catalyzed by histone deacetylases , a large group of enzymes which are classified, based upon their domain structure and sequence homology, into four gene families  <cit> . class i hdacs  are orthologs of the yeast transcriptional regulator rpd <dig> and are primarily localized in the nucleus. class ii hdacs  are homologous to the yeast hda <dig> protein and can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. structurally and mechanistically different classes of hdacs are the sirtuins , also known as class iii hdacs. they are nap-depended enzymes homologous to yeast sir <dig>   <cit> . hdac <dig> is the only histone deacetylase categorized to hdac class iv  <cit> .

it has been previously shown that histone acetylation is crucial for the dynamic regulation of gene expression during differentiation processes. especially, skeletal and cardiac myogenesis have been intensively studied  <cit> . recent publications strongly suggest that hdacs are also important for the development of the nervous system. a large number of different hdacs are expressed in the developing brain, suggesting specific roles for individual hdacs in neural development  <cit> . hdacs have been shown to be involved in the birth and maturation of oligodendrocytes in the rat, mouse, and in zebrafish  <cit> . it has also been shown that hdacs play an important role in the control of neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis. especially hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> have been reported in the regulation of distinct linage specification in developing brain. during neuronal development hdac <dig> and  <dig> are both expressed in stem and progenitor cells. in post-mitotic neurons only hdac <dig> expression can be detected, while hdac <dig> is only expressed in glia  <cit> . deletion of both hdac <dig> and  <dig> results in major abnormalities in cortical, hippocampal and cerebellar development, whereas an individual deletion of hdac <dig> or hdac <dig> has no effect. interestingly, deletion of hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> almost completely blocks the neuronal differentiation, but does not influence astrogliogenesis  <cit> .

trichostatin a , a well-established reversible inhibitor of class i and ii hdacs  <cit> , has been reported to induce cell growth arrest, apoptosis and differentiation in tumor cells  <cit> . the treatment of adult neural progenitor cells with hdac inhibitors causes antiproliferative effects and induces neuronal differentiation, whereas the differentiation of astrocytes or oligodendrocytes is simultaneously not induced  <cit> . in a previous study we could demonstrate that inhibition of class i and ii hdacs with tsa leads to an increase in neurogenesis in the developing cortex, but results in a dramatic reduction in neurogenesis in the medial and lateral ganglionic eminences  of the embryonic forebrain  <cit> . the reduction in neurogenesis in ge-derived neural precursors was accompanied by an increase in the production of immature astrocytes. we could further demonstrate that treatment with recombinant bmp <dig> increased the production of astrocytes in neural precursors derived from ge, whereas no significant increase in astrogliogenesis was detected in cortical neural precursor cells. a co-treatment with tsa and noggin, a bmp <dig> inhibitor, or with alk3-ecd, a recombinant protein that contains the extracellular domain of the bmpr1a receptor, was able to restore the normal levels of neurons and astrocytes, compared to untreated control samples, demonstrating a direct connection between hdac activity and bmp signaling  <cit> . in order to investigate the signaling pathways involved in the differentiation of ge derived neural precursors upon tsa and bmp <dig> treatment, we performed gene expression profiling and protein analysis from bmp <dig> or tsa treated neural precursor cells derived from ge at different time points. here, we show that bmp <dig> and tsa influence neurogenesis in a related manner. we demonstrate that in the early response to bmp <dig> and tsa treatment, different cohorts of functional gene groups are activated or repressed, although the downstream biological effects are closely related. we further characterized individual genes picked up by the microarrays at both mrna and protein levels.

RESULTS
in vitro differentiation of forebrain derived neurosphere cultures
we used neurosphere cultures to generate a uniform population of neural precursors directly from the medial and lateral ganglionic eminences of e <dig>  c57bl/ <dig> mice  <cit> . after 7 days neurospheres were dissociated, plated out as a monolayer, and differentiated according to standard protocols  <cit> . during differentiation fgf <dig> was withdrawn after  <dig>  days, whereas the treatment with tsa or bmp <dig> started  <dig>  days after plating .

cultures were allowed to differentiate for an additional  <dig>  days after fgf <dig> withdrawal and then stained with immunocytofluorescence for standard markers indicating the birth of newborn neurons , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes  . as reported previously  <cit> , both tsa as well as bmp <dig> treatment suppressed neurogenesis and boosted astrogliogenesis, as indicated by the relative number of tuj1-positive neurons and gfap-positive astrocytes in the cultures . simultaneous treatment with both tsa and bmp <dig> showed a similar effect . as reported previously  <cit> , both tsa as well as bmp <dig> treatment suppressed the birth and maturation of oligodendrocytes, as judged by their relative numbers as well as the elaboration of their processes .

in addition western blot analysis of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte specific proteins 24h  and 7 days after treatment with tsa or bmp <dig> were performed . the expression of the astrocyte marker protein gfap significantly increased upon tsa and bmp <dig> treatment. whereas the protein levels of gfap was rather unchanged 24 h after treatment with tsa and bmp <dig> , a strong increase of gfap could be detected 7 days after treatment , indicating that the treatment with tsa and bmp <dig> led to an increase in astrogliogenesis during differentiation of neurosphere cultures. the oligodendrocyte markers plp  and mbp   <cit>  were less clearly regulated on the protein level at both time points, but a small decrease of both markers could be detected 7 days after treatment .

microarray analysis of differentiating neurosphere cultures
rna samples and protein lysates were prepared  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h after treatment. we performed gene expression profiling from cells treated for 6 h and 24 h using affymetrix genchip  <dig>  <dig> . the raw data was analyzed using dchip  software  <cit> . genes were considered to be significantly regulated if their expression had changed more than two-fold and had exceeded a minimal absolute difference of  <dig> comparing treated and mock-treated cells with a confidence greater than 90%. using these conditions  <dig> genes exhibited a differential expression in bmp2-treated cells after 6 h, and  <dig> genes were differentially regulated after 24 h . tsa treatment led to  <dig> differentially-expressed genes after 6 h and  <dig> after 24 h treatment . the top  <dig> genes regulated after tsa or bmp <dig> treatment are listed in the additional file 1: table s1–s <dig> 

to identify an overlap of regulated genes within tsa and bmp <dig> treatments, two-set venn analyses were performed, intersecting tsa 6 h, tsa 24 h, bmp <dig> 6 h and bmp <dig> 24 h experimental sets, respectively. the intersection between two experimental sets is shown in individual venn diagrams . the numbers of regulated genes for each treatment condition are depicted in the diagrams, while individual genes within the intersection are listed in the additional file 1: table s5–s <dig>  comparing these two-set venn diagrams, it could be observed that the majority of regulated genes was unique for one treatment; only a smaller number of genes was located within the intersections between the two experimental sets. the largest intersection of regulated genes was detected between tsa 6 h and tsa 24 h . the intersection between the bmp <dig> 6 h and 24 h experiments was marginally smaller; however more than half of the genes regulated after 6 h overlap with genes regulated after 24 h . comparing the venn analyses of tsa- and bmp2-treated samples at the two different time points an increased number of co-regulated genes could be detected from 6 h to 24 h . whereas only  <dig> genes were regulated in both bmp <dig> 6 h and tsa 6 h , the number of regulated genes in bmp <dig> 24 h and tsa 24 h experimental sets increased 6-fold . this increased number of regulated genes in the intersection of tsa and bmp <dig> treated sample after 24 h mainly resulted from an increase of regulated genes in the bmp <dig> 24 h sample, even if the number of regulated genes in bmp <dig> 24 h experiment is only  <dig> -fold higher than in bmp <dig> 6 h experiment .

in addition to the two-set venn analyses, the overlap of genes regulated in all four sets of experiment and in three out of four sets was additionally analyzed. a summary of these genes is listed in table  <dig>  indicating their fold-change in each treatment. remarkably, only eight genes were significantly altered after the treatment with bmp <dig> and tsa at both time points: gpr <dig> , lims <dig> , bcas <dig> , ptpre , afap1l <dig> , dll <dig> , g0s <dig> , gpd <dig> .  <dig> genes were regulated in at least three out of four experimental sets. most of these genes were regulated in the same direction when treated with bmp <dig> or tsa, and only a few genes exhibited an opposed expression. smad <dig> ), papss <dig> , fam19a <dig> , cadps , car <dig>  and efhd <dig>  are examples for an opposed regulation of expression comparing bmp2- and tsa-treated samples. smad <dig>  papss <dig>  fam19a <dig>  and cadps expression was suppressed after tsa treatment but induced after treatment with bmp <dig>  whereas car <dig> and efhd <dig> expression was regulated in a reverse fashion .

genes significantly regulated upon all treatments  and three out of four treatments are summarized.

in accordance with the results from the two-set venn analysis, the number of co-regulated genes was increased when the bmp <dig> 24 h time point was included in the intersection analysis . however, among these genes, the expression of only a few was significantly stronger regulated after 24 h than after 6 h of both tsa and bmp <dig> treatment. especially, the expression of gpr <dig>  lims <dig>  bcas <dig>  bmp <dig>  enpp <dig>  and gm <dig>  was significantly reduced in 24 h compared to 6 h experiments. it should be mentioned that, among those genes regulated by bmp <dig> 6 h and 24 h and tsa 24 h, several genes known to be involved in bmp2/ <dig> signaling, like bmp <dig>  smad <dig>  fst  and bambi ) were detected.

we also performed hierarchical clustering of the microarray data using the clustering option of dchip  <cit>  to illustrate the overall relationship between regulated genes . all genes regulated in at least one of the analyzed conditions were included using the same stringent criteria as above . the clustering led to two major clusters, one including genes upregulated, the other including genes downregulated upon either treatment. genes upregulated after each treatment were further divided into three sub-clusters, grouping genes upregulated after treatment with  bmp <dig> or  tsa alone or  both bmp <dig> and tsa. each sub-cluster could be subdivided into smaller groups of genes that represent individual time points. within the cluster of downregulated genes, also three sub-clusters could be distinguished, containing genes downregulated after treatment with  bmp <dig> or  tsa alone  and  downregulated after both treatments.

to investigate the specific biological functions of co-regulated groups of genes, we used the david database  for functional annotation of clustered genes  <cit> . functional annotation clustering allows the classification of regulated genes according to their functional relevance. each of the six sub-clusters obtained in the hierarchical clustering was independently annotated. an overview of the various functional categories for the six sub-clusters is shown in table  <dig>  gene ontology annotations of individual clusters can be found in additional file 1: tables s11-s <dig>  strong differences in the functional categories arose upon comparison of up- and downregulated gene clusters. within the gene cluster including genes upregulated after tsa treatment, functional categories like antigen processing, metabolism, cell membrane and cell adhesion were enriched , the cluster of downregulated genes included functional categories related to chromosome organization, transcriptional processes, metabolism, and posttranslational processes . in the case of bmp <dig> treatment, the gene cluster of upregulated genes was enriched for functional categories associated with cell communication, cell membrane, extracellular matrix, differentiation and development . genes downregulated after bmp <dig> treatment were enriched in the functional categories related to cell communication and signal transduction . the functional annotation of the sub-cluster containing genes upregulated after both treatments showed an enrichment of categories related to extracellular matrix and cell adhesion, whereas the sub-cluster of downregulated genes comprised categories related to differentiation and development . as well from the list of individual genes as from the functional cluster analysis it was apparent that bmp <dig> and tsa treatment resulted in independent gene profiles. while tsa treatment mainly led to a regulation of transcriptional processes, bmp <dig> treatment rather resulted in a regulation of signal transduction processes. even though both treatments primarily led to a different expression of genes, the downregulation of certain genes seems to reflect the similar phenotype which we had observed in both tsa- and bmp2-treated neurosphere cultures. while only a few primary target genes of tsa and bmp <dig> were clustered within the sub-clusters containing genes regulated after both treatments, it is obvious that a variety of genes involved in neural development were present, such as the oligodendrocyteproteins mag , mal , mog , omg , mbp , and mobp , which were downregulated in one or both treatments.

since the functional annotation clustering did not disclose an enrichment of direct target genes of tsa or bmp <dig>  and because we detected the strongest overlap of regulated genes between tsa and bmp <dig> treatment after 24 h, we decided to perform an additional david analysis including genes regulated significantly after different times of treatment. figure  <dig> summarizes the clustered functional categories obtained from tsa 6 h, tsa 24 h, bmp <dig> 6 h or bmp <dig> 24 h experiment; only such functional annotation clusters are shown that possessed a significant enrichment score of  <dig> . gene ontology annotations for the clusters can be found in . the functional categories obtained after bmp <dig> 6 h treatment included primarily genes with functions related to developmental processes . in contrast, after 24 h treatment a more diverse set of functional categories was enriched, possessing functions in plasma membrane, cell adhesion, antigen-presenting and developmental processes . after tsa 6 h treatment, categories were enriched which contained genes with functions in histone modification, chromatin organization, transcription regulation and cell cycle control . similar to the 24 h bmp <dig> treatment, the 24 h tsa treatment also showed a more diverse set of functional categories . interestingly, these categories resembled the categories enriched after bmp <dig> 24 h treatment. this functional overlap is also reflected in functional annotation clustering of genes regulated in both bmp <dig> 24 h and tsa 24 h samples. clusters with genes involved in functions in plasma membrane, cell adhesion, cell communication, as well as genes involved in developmental processes were enriched . this suggests that genes regulated after 6 h directly reflected the well-established activity on gene regulation mediated by histone deacetylase inhibition, but that after 24 h already a secondary biological effect may have been observed.

validation of the microarray data with mrna expression analysis
for validation of the microarray data, we selected several genes and performed quantitative rt-pcr. gpr <dig> , bambi , smad <dig>  and bmp <dig>  were chosen from the lists of genes regulated in both tsa and bmp <dig> treatment. in order to obtain a more detailed view of the regulatory response, one additional time point and two additional tsa concentrations were used . all selected genes showed consistent expression patterns in rt-pcr and the microarray experiments, although fold-changes determined in the microarray analysis and the quantitative rt-pcr differed significantly. in addition to bambismad <dig> and bmp <dig>  known to be involved in bmp signaling, we decided to analyze the expression of bmp <dig>  and the bmp target genes id <dig>  and id <dig> . while bmp <dig> was downregulated upon tsa treatment , the expression of bmp <dig> was significantly upregulated in a concentration dependent manner after 6 h, but not after  <dig> and 24 h . surprisingly, id <dig> and id <dig> expression was downregulated at 6 h, but increased after 12 h, resulting in a similar level of expression compared with bmp2-treated cells after 24 h, suggesting a partial bmp signaling-independent effect on id expression. we furthermore investigated stat <dig>  , known to be an upstream regulator of bmp expression  <cit>  but also to co-regulate astrocyte specific genes through the formation of a stat3-p300-smad complex  <cit> . we also decided to analyze wnt5a   and wisp <dig>  , both of which are involved in wnt signaling and are known to act upstream of bmp signaling  <cit> . stat <dig> , as well as wnt5a  and wisp <dig> , were significantly upregulated upon tsa treatment in a time and concentration dependent manner.

validation of the microarray data with protein analysis
based upon the upregulation of stat <dig> mrna expression , and its known role in bmp2-triggered astrogliogenesis, we performed western blot analysis of stat <dig> and other proteins known to be involved in signaling during astrogliogenesis. we investigated the phosphorylation of smad1/5/ <dig>  known mediators of bmp signaling, stat <dig>  and gsk3-beta, a signaling protein in the canonical wnt signaling pathway . smad1/5/ <dig> was phosphorylated in the bmp <dig> treated samples after  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h, but tsa treatment did not lead to smad1/5/ <dig> phosphorylation . in contrast, pstat <dig> was strongly induced after tsa treatment , showing an increase from 6 h to 24 h, while bmp <dig> treatment did not induce stat <dig> phosphorylation . treatment with tsa led to a strong reduction of gsk3-beta phosphorylation after 24 h, whereas almost no change could be detected after 6 h and phosphorylation was rather increased after 12 h . the concentration of pgsk3-beta was quantified using an arraytube™  based sandwich elisa microarray. interestingly, the sandwich elisa microarray disclosed a clear regulation of erk <dig> phosphorylation upon both bmp <dig> and tsa treatment . at the 6 h and 12 h time point perk <dig> was induced in a concentration dependent manner after tsa treatment, but also after bmp <dig> treatment. after 24 h of treatment the perk <dig> signal clearly decreased, which suggested that perk <dig> is involved in the early signaling following bmp <dig> and tsa treatment.

discussion
we previously demonstrated that treatment of neuronal precursor cells derived from the ganglionic eminences  with bmp <dig> or tsa resulted in a reduction in the generation of neurons and oligodendrocytes and in an increase in the production of astrocytes  <cit> . in this study, we performed gene expression profiling upon cultures treated with either bmp <dig> or tsa in order to identify common genes and signaling pathways regulating the differentiation of ge neural precursor cells. the fact that treatment with bmp <dig> or tsa resulted in identical cell fates was reflected in the gene expression data by a significant overlap of regulated genes. comparing the 6 h and 24 h experiments, it became obvious that the overlap of regulated genes between both treatments increased with the duration of time. after 6 h the gene expression profile between bmp <dig> and tsa treatment differed significantly. short treatment with tsa resulted in regulation of genes related to histone/chromatin modification, drug response, and fundamental cellular functions, whereas bmp <dig> treatment led to an early regulation of developmental processes via activation of bmp signaling. this difference in the early response confirms the specificity of both treatments. treatment with the small molecule inhibitor tsa elicits an induction of stress response genes, including heat shock proteins )  <cit> , oxidative stress , txnip )  <cit>  and damage response genes , pmaip <dig> )  <cit> . a dominant effect of tsa treatment is the regulation of chromatin organization and remodeling genes, which are significantly enriched . the distribution of go groups regulated by tsa is comparable to published data  <cit> .

after 24 h, both treatments resulted in a more similar expression profile, not just by an overlap of individual genes but also through the alteration of several groups of genes regulating cell communication, cell adhesion and developmental processes. as shown previously, a 24hour treatment with tsa just before bfgf withdrawal was sufficient to promote astrogliogenesis and inhibit the birth of neurons and oligodendrocytes in ge-derived precursor cultures  <cit> . together with the results from gene expression profiling it can be assumed that a short treatment with tsa stimulates these cell fate decisions through epigenetic modification that lead to the up- and downregulation of the corresponding developmental genes, though it is also possible that the effect does not occur at the transcriptional level, but rather through acetylation of cytoplasmic or nuclear non-histone proteins. the stronger correlation in the 24 h gene expression data set between tsa- and bmp2-treated cultures reveals that even if the early gene expression response to the treatment differs dramatically, similar downstream processes are induced, resulting in a comparable cell fate phenotype.

bmps can enhance neurogenesis or gliogenesis depending upon the developmental stage or brain localization. during mid-gestation bmps are neurogenic  <cit> , whereas in late prenatal and postnatal stages they are astrogliogenic  <cit> . the data from gene expression profiling revealed however a surprising downregulation of bmp signaling genes after tsa or bmp <dig> treatment. bmp <dig> and the receptors bmpr1a and bmpr1b were significantly downregulated in response to tsa, whereas bmp signaling inhibitors, like bambictgf  and fst, were significantly upregulated. only the bmp signaling inhibitor smad <dig> was significantly downregulated after tsa treatment. this indicates that both tsa and bmp <dig> initiate both a direct, positive response activating the downstream bmp signaling pathway as well as a subsequent negative feedback loop that results in induction of bmp signaling inhibitors and downregulation of bmp <dig> and its receptors. this clear inactivation of further bmp signaling could reflect the transition between differentiation states, which requires changes in sensitivity to bmp signals. sensitivity to growth factors as well as the duration of signals plays an important role for bmp- and tgf-beta family signaling in development. established mechanisms include selective expression and degradation of receptors and in particular a range of mechanisms to control the duration of the signal of activated regulatory smads  through negative feedback mechanisms, including expression of inhibitor smads  and dephosphorylation and degradation of regulatory smads  <cit> .

interestingly, our gene expression profiling did not show an increase in astrocyte-specific genes. classic markers known to be upregulated during astrocyte differentiation were either not regulated ), or were downregulated ). this prompted us to look more closely at the array data and indeed we were able to identify two transcription factors, id <dig> and id <dig>  whose expression levels did not significantly change in the array studies but whose expression was documented to significantly increase upon either bmp <dig> or tsa treatment. bmp <dig> has previously been shown to cause upregulation of id <dig> and id <dig> <cit> , and forced expression of either gene can inhibit neurogenesis in telencephalic cultures  <cit> , suggesting that these two factors play a role in the bmp-promoted switch from neurogenesis to astrogliogenesis. in addition, we could demonstrate significant increases in the mrna and protein levels of stat <dig> and also in its phosphorylated, transcriptionally active form. this is of particular relevance for astrogliogenesis as stat <dig> has been shown to functionally interact with the bmp2-responsive transcription factor smad1/5/ <dig> at the p <dig> transcriptional coactivator and thereby synergistically promote astrogliogenesis  <cit> . how tsa promotes an increase in stat <dig> levels is unclear at this point, but we have uncovered evidence that the acetylation of stat <dig> is regulated by tsa-mediated hdac inhibition .the transient activation of erk <dig> in response to bmp <dig> and tsa treatment could play a role in the control of the duration of activated smad1/5/ <dig> signals. erk <dig>  but also other kinases, including gsk3-beta, are involved in the control of smad signals through smad linker phosphorylation  <cit> . phosphorylation of the linker region by erk <dig> and gsk3-beta targets regulatory smads for ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation  <cit> . the observed activation of erk <dig> should lead to a more rapid degradation of activated smads, which can be further modulated by gsk3-beta. thus, induction of erk <dig> by phosphorylation would contribute to termination of bmp signals  <cit> .

analysis of the genes upregulated in response to tsa and bmp <dig> treatment revealed several genes known to be expressed in neurons. most of these genes are not markers or regulators of basic neurogenesis, but are rather involved in maturation processes or establishment of the neuronal network, such as neurite outgrowth, axon guidance and synapse maturation and function. the fact that we see an upregulation of these genes can be possibly explained by the developmental age of the cultures, which were derived from e <dig>  ge. at this time point neurogenesis has reached its peak, before radial glia cells in ge start to generate astrocytes  <cit> . it is possible that both tsa and bmp <dig> are upregulating the expression of functional neuronal genes in those precursors that have already committed to the neuronal fate or have already been born as neurons. the cultures in our experiments were treated at  <dig>  div, and a small amount of neurogenesis has already occurred at this time point  <cit> . in addition, it is known that markers of maturing neurons already begin to be expressed by neuronal progenitors  <cit> .

tsa and bmp <dig> treatment results in a drastic downregulation of genes known to be specific for oligodendrocytes, such as sox <dig>  and nkx2- <dig> , a variety of genes involved in myelinization magmalmogomgmbpmobpgm <dig>  and other genes known to be highly expressed in oligodendrocytes, such as gpr17bcas <dig>  and enpp <dig> <cit> . the fact that genes involved in myelinization were strongly regulated explains the appearance of membrane-related go terms in the functional annotation clustering. the downregulation of oligodendrocyte specific genes in our experiments is in accordance with a reduction of oligodendrocytes that was observed by ourselves  <cit>  and others  <cit> . many of these oligodendrocyte specific genes were not only significantly down-regulated upon tsa treatment but also after bmp <dig> treatment, especially after 24 h. this also corresponds with previous reports showing that bmps promote the production of astroglia while inhibiting oligodendrocyte differentiation  <cit> . the fact that treatment with bmp <dig> and tsa downregulates oligodendrocyte specific genes seems to be a common feature of both compounds, but it still needs to be clarified if the demonstrated effect is due to the same regulatory mechanism. upregulation of wnt5awisp <dig>  and other genes from wnt signaling in our experiments could give a certain indication that the regulatory mechanism could be related in both cases. wnt signaling leads to the suppression of oligodendrocyte differentiation and promotes neuronal and astroglial differentiation  <cit> . the connection between bmp and wnt signaling  <cit>  as well as between hdacs and wnt signaling  <cit>  had been shown to be important for astroglial and oligodendroglial lineage commitment, and it will be of great interest to examine whether hdacs and bmps share a common pathway in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation, as we have shown for astrocyte differentiation in this work.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have delineated at the genomic transcriptome level the responses to two different compounds that we and others have shown to lead to similar biological outcomes in the differentiation of neural progenitor cells to neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the embryonic forebrain. interestingly, the range of responses to bmp <dig> and to the global hdac inhibitor tsa were dramatically different, with bmp leading to an upregulation of genes involved in cell-cell communication and developmental processes while tsa resulted in an upregulation of genes involved in chromatin modification and transcription. surprisingly, the biological convergence of the genomic responses could not be reduced to canonical bmp signaling through smad1/5/ <dig> activation, rather hdac inhibition and bmp <dig> signaling converge through stat <dig> and smad1/5/8-mediated signaling and id <dig> activation which increases astrogliogenesis from neural stem cells. this result explains the similar outcomes of hdac inhibition and bmp with respect to astrogliogenesis, and the microarray profiling also suggests new pathways, for example wnt signaling, which may be of further relevance for the interaction between these two developmentally-crucial protein families.
