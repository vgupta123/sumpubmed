BACKGROUND
in recent years, though the cost of genomic experiments has decreased rapidly, the interpretation of their results is still an open problem. the complete sequencing of the human genome in  <dig>  <cit>  led to the identification of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms  by the hapmap consortium project  <cit>  and the human variation project  <cit> . this created a significant need for bioinformatics tools to analyze the large amount of data to detect functional snps and describe their molecular effects. currently the number of validated snps in the dbsnp database is greater than  <dig> million  <cit> . in general, mutations occurring in coding regions may have a greater impact on the gene’s functionality than those occurring in non-coding regions  <cit> . only a small fraction of snps  corresponds to the subset of annotated missense coding snps  <cit> . for this subset of single amino acid polymorphisms , curators of the swiss institute of bioinformatics classify them into disease-related saps and neutral saps, according to the corpus of peer-reviewed literature. in the last few years, several methods have been developed to predict the impact of a given sap  <cit> . these algorithms are able to predict the effect of the mutation on protein stability  <cit> , protein functional activity  <cit> , and insurgence of human pathologies  <cit> . the majority of methods rely on information derived from protein sequence  <cit> , while others use protein structure data  <cit>  and knowledge-based information  <cit> . in particular, sift  <cit>  and polyphen <dig>  <cit>  rely on different representations of evolutionary information. sift scores the normalized probabilities for all possible substitutions at a mutated site using a multiple sequence alignment of homologous proteins. polyphen <dig> predicts the impact of variants by calculating a position specific independent counts  matrix from a multiple sequence alignment. protein family specific hmm models have also been implemented in panther  <cit>  to detect deleterious mutations. machine learning-based approaches such as phd-snp  <cit>  and snap  <cit>  have shown better results with respect to traditional approaches. recently described methods rely on knowledge-based information to reach overall accuracy greater than 80%. for instance, snps&go  <cit>  includes a new log-odd score calculated from go terms, and mutpred  <cit>  uses different machine learning approaches to evaluate the probabilities of gain or loss of predicted structural and functional properties. the structural context of the mutations has been studied to determine the mechanism of action of each mutation at the protein level  <cit> . in addition, protein three-dimensional structural features have been used to improve the prediction of the impact of saps on protein function  <cit>  and human health  <cit> . although the predictive power of protein structural information has been established, a quantitative comparison between structure-based and sequence-based methods is still needed. in this paper, we focus our attention on the prediction of disease-related saps using a novel machine learning-based method that takes as input, protein sequence, protein structure, and protein function information . for the fist time, we predict deleterious single point mutations considering in a unique framework protein structure information, used for the prediction of stability changes in i-mutant  <cit> , and protein sequence, evolutionary and functional information, used in the recently developed snps&go algorithm  <cit> . to quantify the improvement of the performance resulting from the use of protein structure information, we compared the accuracy of svm-3d against a similar sequence and function-based method   <cit> , sift  <cit>  and polyphen <dig>  <cit> . in particular, the comparison with polyphen <dig>  <cit>  is more appropriate because it considers in input structural features such as secondary structures, solvent accessibility and normalized b factor of the mutated residue. the results show that protein three-dimensional structure information increases the accuracy in detection of deleterious saps and can provide insight about the disease mechanism.

RESULTS
performance of the method
in the last decades, machine learning approaches have been successfully used to address several biological problems and develop new prediction tools. we modified a previously developed predictor  <cit>  by introducing three-dimensional structure information. in particular, we used new features to describe the structural environment of the mutation, examining the protein elements within a radius of  <dig> Å around the c-α atom . to quantify the improvement in accuracy resulting from the use of 3d structure information, we compared the performance of our structure-based method  with a sequence-based one . in table  <dig> are reported different accuracy measurements for both predictors tested on b3d dataset . the structure-based method results in 3% improvement in overall accuracy and  <dig>  higher correlation. comparing the roc curves , svm-3d gives  <dig>  better area under the curve  with respect to svm-seq. if 10% of wrong predictions are accepted, svm-3d has 7% more true positives. the output returned by the svm has been used to calculate the reliability index  in order to filter predictions. if predictions with ri> <dig> are selected, the svm-3d method achieves 91% overall accuracy and  <dig>  correlation coefficient on 78% of the whole dataset . analyzing the predictions of svm-seq and svm-3d, we found that the outputs agree in the 91% of the cases. on this subset, the overall accuracy is 87% and the correlation coefficient of the method is  <dig> . for the remaining 9% of the predictions, svm-seq results in very poor overall accuracy and correlation, 34% and - <dig> , respectively. svm-3d performs slightly better than random, giving 66% overall accuracy and  <dig>  correlation coefficient .

the accuracy measures are defined in methods section. d and n are disease-related and neutral variants respectively. methods are tested on the b3d dataset.

seq∩3d indicates the subset of agree predictions between svm-3d and svm-seq. seq-3d and 3d-seq are respectively the predictions of svm-seq and svm-3d on the not agree prediction subset. the accuracy measures are defined in methods section. pm is the fraction of the dataset. d and n are disease-related and neutral variants respectively.

comparison with other methods
the accuracy of our svm-based methods has been compared with sift and polyphen <dig>  to score the performance of the methods on a set composed with highly reliable neutral polymorphism, we calculated their accuracy on n3d dataset. the results in table  <dig> show that svm-3d has 2% higher accuracy and 3% higher correlation coefficient with respect to the polyphen <dig> and svm-seq. in addition svm-3d and sift result in 79% sensitivity in the prediction of neutral polymorphism that is 3% higher than the same value reached by svm-seq and polyphen <dig>  although the level of improvement is slightly lower with respect to previously reported data, we should note that it has been obtained only on ~12% of the whole a3d dataset.

to evaluate the minimum level of improvement resulting from the use of protein structure information, we performed a more stringent test using a set of mutations  occurring in proteins annotated with the gene ontology term “kinase activity” . our svm-based methods have been trained on a dataset  without any protein with “kinase activity” and without any significant sequence similarity to proteins in kin dataset. to keep the number of disease-related and neutral polymorphism balanced, in the training step the neutral variants have been doubled considering their reverse mutations. we have compared the performances of our sequence  and structure-based  methods against sift and polyphen <dig>  the scores obtained on kin dataset confirm that svm-3d results in 3% higher accuracy and more than 3% correlation with respect to sift and polyphen <dig> . these values represent a significant lower bound level of improvement  since in the nokin training set there is not any protein with significant sequence similarity  to proteins in kin dataset. in addition, all functional information associated to go: <dig> and its sub annotations are not considered for the calculation of the lgo score in the kin dataset. in this test, performed on a lower number of mutations, although the improvement of the performances between svm-seq and svm-3d is not significant , svm-3d is still resulting in 2% higher accuracy and  <dig>  higher correlation coefficient with respect to svm-seq.

structure environment analysis
protein three-dimensional structural information is an important feature for predicting the effects of saps. analysis of the protein structure provides information about the environment of the mutation. in fact, the effect of a mutation depends critically upon the location of the residue, specifically if it is buried in the hydrophobic core or exposed on the surface of the protein. in figure  <dig> panel a, we plot the distributions of the relative solvent accessible area  for disease-related and neutral variants. the two distributions have mean rsa values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for disease-related and neutral variants, respectively . they are significantly different and the kolmogorov-smirnov test results in a p-value of  <dig> ·10- <dig>  we calculated the overall accuracy and correlation coefficient of our method dividing the dataset in  <dig> bins according to rsa value of the mutated residue. the svm-3d method shows better performance in the prediction of buried  and highly exposed  mutated residues .

scoring the residue interactions
protein structure gives insight to the interactions between residues far in primary sequence but close in 3d space. we defined two types of interactions: the “lost” interactions are those missing as a direct result of the mutation event and the “gained” interactions are those expected to be formed by the new  residue. we compared the frequency of lost and gained interactions in the context of disease or neutral mutations. in figure  <dig> panels a and b, we show the log-odd scores for lost and gained interactions, respectively. according to these results, the most deleterious lost contacts are between cysteines  and the most damaging gained interactions are between tryptophans . a missing cys-cys interaction can lead to the loss of a disulphide bond that strongly contribute to the protein’s stability by modulating the hydrophobicity of both native and denatured states  <cit> . the mutation of a residue to a tryptophan when close to other aromatic residues can stabilize the structure but may increase the protein aggregation rate  <cit> .

we discuss two examples where sequence-based method wrongly classifies two disease-related variants while structure-based algorithm is able to predict them correctly. an example of lost cys-cys interaction is the mutation of cys <dig> in glycosylasparaginase . this mutation is responsible for the insurgence of aspartylglucosaminuria . visual inspection of the protein structure  shows that mutation of cys <dig> to serine results in the loss of the disulfide bridge between cys <dig> and cys <dig> . an interesting example of a possibly damaging gained interaction can be observed in the thyroid hormone receptor , where mutation of arg <dig> to tryptophan is cause of thyroid hormone resistance . analyzing the protein structure , we expect that the new tryptophan will be in proximity to another tryptophan in position  <dig> and a phenylalanine in position  <dig>  thus, this mutation could result in stereo-chemical problems in the pocket around the position  <dig> . in addition after mutation, the  <dig> aromatic residues  in the exposed region could increase aggregation rate of the protein. the case of cys163ser variant in glycosylasparaginase is a good example where structure-based method svm-3d results in correct prediction because it able to capture the disulfide bond between cys <dig> and cys <dig> that is not described by the local sequence environment represented in svm-seq.

discussion
the results of this work show that protein structure information increases the accuracy of the prediction of deleterious mutations. the increments of 3% in overall accuracy and auc, and 6% in correlation coefficient, with respect to the sequence-based method, are comparable with the improvement of the performance obtained using protein function information  <cit> . although this gain is significant , it is not as high as expected. in the next future, higher number of mutations from proteins with known structure will increase the performances of structure-based methods with respect to sequence-based ones. the protein data bank  only contains a subset of structures describing mutant proteins and the quaternary interactions. due to these limitations, our method only takes in to account structural information about the wild-type protein and intra-chain tertiary interactions. this model is a good approximation to describe the structural environment of the buried residues but it is not appropriate for exposed residues. this limitation justifies the lower level of accuracy observed for exposed residues . in particular, for mutated residues with more than 40% exposed surface the correlation coefficient of the predictions is lower than the mean correlation coefficient resulting from the sequence-based predictor. the limitations of our algorithm to describe the structural changes and the environment of exposed residues make the gain of 3% in accuracy and auc a lower bound estimation of the improvement. similar level of improvement has been obtained in the stringent test of kin dataset where, without “kinese activity” functional information and homolog proteins in the training set, our structure-based method resulted in ~3% higher accuracy and auc with respect to sift and polyphen <dig>  these results are particularly encouraging because the svm-3d method reaches higher level of accuracy with respect to polyphen <dig>  which includes protein structure information in the input features. according to these observations, further improvements of our structure-based method will require the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the mutated proteins and the protein-protein interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a new machine learning approach that integrates protein structure information to predict the effects of saps. to quantify the increase in accuracy achieved by protein structure information, we compared our method to a previously developed sequence-based predictor. using a balanced set of  <dig>  mutations, the structure-based method results in about 3% higher accuracy and auc and  <dig>  higher correlation with respect to the sequence-based approach. in addition, our svm-3d approach results in 3% better accuracy and auc with respect to sift and polyphen <dig>  although the increase in performance is not extremely high, the introduction of structure information provides insight about disease mechanism. the prediction improvement is also in agreement with previous results, where structure information enhanced the prediction of protein stability change upon amino acid mutation  <cit> .
