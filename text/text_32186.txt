BACKGROUND
the production of toxic metabolites is an important factor that shapes the spatial and temporal arrangement of metabolic processes within microbial cells  <cit> . toxic metabolites may form as intermediates, side products, or end products of metabolism, and there are numerous examples of how microbial cells arrange metabolic processes in space and time to prevent the accumulation of these metabolites or to divert them away from sensitive biological processes  <cit> . consider the denitrification process whereby some types of microbial cells sequentially reduce nitrate  to nitrite , nitric oxide , nitrous oxide  and finally to dinitrogen gas  to yield energy   <cit> . the metabolic intermediate nitric oxide is a free radical that has cytotoxic effects on cell division and forms metal-nitrosyl complexes with enzymes  <cit> . indeed, nitric oxide performs many of the antimicrobial functions of macrophages  <cit> . thus, denitrifying microorganisms must maintain nitric oxide at low concentrations during denitrification. to achieve this, nitric oxide regulates the transcription of denitrification genes  <cit> , suggesting regulatory solutions to control the production and consumption rates of nitric oxide and prevent its accumulation. in addition, denitrifying microorganisms typically produce and consume nitric oxide in the periplasmic space of the cell, thus preventing nitric oxide from interacting with sensitive biological processes that occur within the cytoplasm  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the denitrification pathway of p. stutzeri. nitrate is first reduced to nitrite in the cytoplasm. nitrite is then actively transported to the periplasmic space where it is further reduced through several intermediates to dinitrogen gas. the consequence is that nitrite accumulates in the periplasm. enzymes: nar, nitrate reductase; nir, nitrite reductase; nor, nitric oxide reductase; nos, nitrous oxide reductase




while it is clear that the production of toxic metabolites have shaped the spatial and temporal arrangement of metabolic processes within microbial cells, it is less clear how metabolite toxicity affects the pace of molecular evolution itself. in this context, we use the term “pace of molecular evolution” to refer to the number of mutations that accumulate per generation and not to the number of mutations that accumulate per unit time. metabolite toxicity could affect the pace of molecular evolution by at least two distinct mechanisms. first, metabolite toxicity might directly  or indirectly  increase the mutation rate, thus providing a larger set of mutations for selection or drift to act upon  <cit> . second, metabolite toxicity might decrease the absolute fitness of the cell; that is, metabolite toxicity might cause slower growth rates or lower yields due to their potentially deleterious effects on biological processes. this could result in increased selection pressure and increased numbers of available mutations with large beneficial effects for selection to act upon , thus increasing the rate at which those mutations increase in frequency  <cit> .

our main objectives were to experimentally test whether the toxicity of a single metabolite does indeed increase the pace of molecular evolution and to determine by which mechanisms such an effect might emerge . to address these objectives, we developed an experimental system where we could manipulate the toxicity of a single metabolite. we then experimentally evolved replicated populations of bacteria at two distinct levels of metabolite toxicity, quantified the types and numbers of mutations that accumulated during experimental evolution, and tested whether metabolite toxicity affects the pace of molecular evolution.

our experimental system is based on the denitrifying bacterium pseudomonas stutzeri a <dig> , which is a facultative anaerobe with a fully sequenced genome  <cit> . in the absence of oxygen, p. stutzeri can use nitrogen oxides as terminal electron acceptors to support its growth  <cit> . p. stutzeri sequentially reduces nitrate  to nitrite , nitric oxide , nitrous oxide , and finally to dinitrogen gas  using different enzyme complexes for each reduction step   <cit> . an important feature of this experimental system is that the metabolite nitrite accumulates in batch culture and has ph-dependent toxic effects  <cit> . as the ph decreases, nitrite increasingly generates nitrous acid , which uncouples proton translocation  <cit> . in addition, nitrite increasingly and spontaneously generates nitric oxide radicals that impose cytotoxic effects on cell division and form metal-nitrosyl complexes with enzymes  <cit> . the consequence is that, as the ph decreases, the increased toxicity of nitrite has negative effects on growth and metabolic activity  <cit> . in general, nitrite toxicity has negligible effects at ph  <dig>  and severe effects at ph  <dig> , while ph itself has no measureable effects under the same ph range  <cit> . the ph of the culture medium can therefore be used to manipulate nitrite toxicity without creating substantial confounding factors  <cit> , thus allowing us to test the hypothesis that increased nitrite toxicity increases the pace of molecular evolution. indeed, we previously demonstrated that ph itself has no statistically significant effects on the growth of p. stutzeri under the experimental conditions used in this study while nitrite is non-toxic at ph  <dig>  but severely toxic at ph  <dig>   <cit> .

RESULTS
increased nitrite toxicity accelerates molecular evolution
our first objective was to experimentally test whether increased toxicity of a single metabolite, nitrite , increases the pace of molecular evolution. to achieve this objective, we experimentally evolved eight populations of p. stutzeri at ph  <dig>   and eight populations at ph  <dig>   for approximately  <dig> generations. we then randomly selected a single clone from each evolved population, sequenced its genome, and quantified the number of mutations within that clone when compared to the ancestral clone . we found that more mutations accumulated in clones evolved at ph  <dig>  than at ph  <dig> , thus supporting our main hypothesis  . we further found that one clone evolved at ph  <dig>  accumulated five times more mutations than the other clones evolved at ph  <dig> . this clone contains a loss of function mutation in the uvra gene, which encodes for subunit a of excinuclease, a protein involved in nucleotide excision-based dna repair  <cit> . thus, this mutation likely caused an increased mutation rate in this clone. we therefore further tested whether more mutations accumulated in clones evolved at ph  <dig>  than at ph  <dig>  when this clone was removed from the statistical analysis, and this was indeed the case  . this was also true when we only took into account non-synonymous mutations within protein coding regions . thus, our data supports the hypothesis that the increased reactivity of a single metabolite can increase the pace of molecular evolution.fig.  <dig> the number of mutations that accumulated in clones after evolution at ph  <dig>   or ph  <dig>  . horizontal bars and p-values indicate the outcomes of two-sample wilcoxon rank-sum tests. the arrow indicates the clone with a mutation in uvra. data are presented as tukey box-plots




increased mutation rates are unlikely  to account for the increased pace of molecular evolution. the increased numbers of mutations in clones evolved at ph  <dig>   could be due to either increased mutation rates or increased numbers of available mutations with large beneficial effects that selection could act upon. they could also be caused by epistatic effects among mutations or by demographic differences between treatments. we investigated whether increased mutation rates were important by categorizing all mutations by mutation type: point mutations , indels , large deletions , mutations conferred by insertion sequences, and mutations in ribosomal genes . we reasoned that, if the accelerated pace of molecular evolution was predominantly caused by increased mutation rates, than we would expect increased numbers of synonymous substitutions to accumulate within those clones. this was not the case. there was no significant difference in the frequency of synonymous substitutions  or the absolute abundance of synonymous substitutions  for clones evolved at ph  <dig>  compared to clones evolved at ph  <dig>  . this was true regardless of whether we included or removed the clone with the mutation in the uvra gene from the analysis. indeed, we did not detect any synonymous mutations at all in the clones evolved at ph  <dig> , except within the clone that has a mutation within the uvra gene. taken together, with the exception of the single clone with a mutation in the uvra gene, we have no evidence that differences in mutation rates generally explain the increased numbers of mutations that accumulated within clones evolved at ph  <dig>  . however, we acknowledge that we do not have direct measures of mutation rates, and we instead rely on proxy measures such as comparing rates of synonymous substitutions. it is possible that the absence of different numbers of synonymous substitutions may be due to the low numbers of total mutations that were observed in this study, which could be addressed in the future via sequencing additional clones or investigating longer evolutionary time-scales.fig.  <dig> the types of mutations that accumulated in clones after evolution at ph  <dig>   or ph  <dig>  . each mutation was categorized by type and frequency among all mutations. data are presented as tukey box-plots




interestingly, we did find that clones evolved at ph  <dig>   accumulated different types of mutations than those evolved at ph  <dig>  . clones evolved at ph  <dig> , which exhibited the increased pace of molecular evolution, accumulated significantly more non-synonymous substitutions than other types of mutations  . in contrast, clones evolved at ph  <dig>  accumulated significantly more short indels in coding regions than other types of mutations  . the different types of mutations did not always occur in different target genes. for example, mutations occurred in the oprq gene at both ph conditions, but the mutations are short deletions at ph  <dig>  and primarily single-base substitutions at ph  <dig> .

increased nitrite toxicity leads to larger increases in absolute fitness
if the increased numbers of mutations in clones evolved at ph  <dig>   were generally due to increased numbers of available mutations with large beneficial effects that selection could act upon, then we would expect the populations evolved at ph  <dig>  to have larger increases in fitness than the populations evolved at ph  <dig>  relative to the ancestral clones. we tested this expectation using growth assays and measuring the time for populations to reach stationary phase, which is equivalent to the time required for complete substrate consumption under our experimental conditions  <cit> . we calculated the relative time for complete substrate consumption as the time for the evolved populations to enter stationary phase  divided by the time for the ancestral populations to enter stationary phase . we report the ratios of tevol to tanc in fig.  <dig>  we found that the populations evolved at ph  <dig>  had significantly smaller ratios of tevol to tanc than those evolved at ph  <dig>   . overall, the populations evolved at ph  <dig>  required approximately 50% of the ancestral time to reach stationary phase while the populations evolved at ph  <dig>  required about 80% of the ancestral time . we note that the clone with the mutation in the uvrc gene is not an outlier for these analyses, suggesting that the increased number of mutations resulting from a potentially increased mutation rate does not cause a measurable change in the fitness of this clone. together, our results are consistent with the increased numbers of mutations that accumulated in populations evolved at ph  <dig>   being caused by increased numbers of available mutations with large beneficial effects.fig.  <dig> relative time to stationary phase for each experimental evolution condition. data are the time to reach stationary phase for the evolved clones divided by the time to stationary phase for the ancestral clones. the horizontal bar and p-value indicates the outcome of a two-sample wilcoxon rank-sum test. the asterisk indicates p <  <dig> . the data are presented as tukey box-plots




increased nitrite toxicity leads to larger increases in competitive fitness
because evolution at ph  <dig>   led to both increased numbers of mutations and larger increases in fitness, we further investigated whether evolution at ph  <dig>  also results in increased competitive fitness. we define competitive fitness as the relative fitness of an evolved clone when competed directly against its ancestor in co-culture. to address this, we performed four different competition assays where we competed evolved clones against ancestral clones. we initiated the competition assays with 5% of evolved cells and 95% of ancestral cells, as our previous competition assays using an initial ratio of 50% of evolved cells and 50% of ancestral cells did not yield any significant differences . this was likely because the evolved cells accumulated less nitrite. thus, when they are present at high frequencies, they reduce nitrite accumulation and “rescue” the ancestral cells.

we first tested whether the clones evolved at ph  <dig>   improved in competitive fitness more than the clones evolved at ph  <dig>  , which would be expected given that the clones evolved at ph  <dig>  accumulated more mutations and consumed substrates more rapidly as compared to the ancestor . to accomplish this, we compared the competitive fitness of the evolved clones when they were competed against the ancestor at the same conditions as they were evolved. we found that the clones evolved at ph  <dig>  increased in competitive fitness significantly more than the clones evolved at ph  <dig>   , thus supporting our expectation.fig.  <dig> competitive fitness of evolved clones relative to the ancestor. evolved cells were initially present in the culture at a frequency of 5%. differences were compared using an anova test followed by a post hoc tukey’s hsd test. significant differences correspond to p <  <dig> . alphabetic assignments indicate groups that are statistically different from each other




we next assessed competitive fitness in the non-selected environments. first, we compared the competitive fitness of clones evolved at ph  <dig>   when competed against the ancestor at ph  <dig>   or ph  <dig> . the objective was to investigate if the fitness benefits acquired during evolution at ph  <dig>  become more pronounced at ph  <dig> . we found that the clones evolved at ph  <dig>  increased in competitive fitness significantly more when competed at ph  <dig>  than at ph  <dig>   . this indicates that the mutations that accumulated in clones evolved at ph  <dig>  have larger benefits at ph  <dig>  than at ph  <dig> . this could occur, for example, if mutations emerged that reduce the intracellular accumulation of nitrite. while potentially beneficial regardless of the ph, the beneficial effects would be greater at ph  <dig>  when nitrite is toxic. further experiments would be needed to test this possibility.

next, we compared the competitive fitness of clones evolved at ph  <dig>   or ph  <dig>   against the ancestor at ph  <dig> . the objective was to investigate if evolution at ph  <dig>  leads to larger fitness benefits at ph  <dig>  than evolution at ph  <dig> . indeed, we found that the clones evolved at ph  <dig>  increased in competitive fitness significantly more than the clones evolved at ph  <dig>   . this indicates that, even though the mutations accumulated in clones evolved at ph  <dig>  had larger benefits at ph  <dig>  than at ph  <dig> , this is not sufficient to account for all of the increased fitness of clones at ph  <dig> .

finally, we compared the competitive fitness of the clones evolved at ph  <dig>   or ph  <dig>   when competed against the ancestor at ph  <dig> . the objective was to investigate if the increased fitness benefits in clones evolved at ph  <dig>  have any significant effect at ph  <dig> . we found that there is no significant difference in the competitive fitness between the two evolutionary conditions when assayed at ph  <dig>   . these results indicate that there are indeed mutations that have a beneficial effect on fitness at ph  <dig>  that have no effect at ph  <dig> . taken together with the outcomes from the other competition assays, our data supports the idea that the larger increase in competitive fitness found after evolution at ph  <dig>  is both due to an increased benefit of the same type of mutations that are found at ph  <dig>  as well as additional types of mutations that have a benefit only at ph  <dig> . we acknowledge, however, that interactions between mutations may also be critical in addition to individual mutation effects.

increased nitrite toxicity selects for mutations in genes with a broader variety of functional annotations
we next tested whether evolution at ph  <dig>   not only promotes more mutations to accumulate, but also affects the functional composition of those mutations. to address this, we functionally categorized each gene with a mutation according to existing annotations  <cit> . in this analysis, we only included non-synonymous substitutions in coding regions or point mutations in intergenic regions that are likely to be involved in transcription . clones evolved at ph  <dig>  only have mutations in three functional categories: cell motility, signal transduction and unknown functions. mutations in these types of functions are also commonly found in clones evolved at ph  <dig> . the numbers of mutations in the clones do not differ between the two conditions  for these functional categories. clones evolved at ph  <dig>  had mutations in all of the same categories discussed above, but also have mutations in additional categories: carbohydrate transport and metabolism, lipid transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, inorganic ion transport and metabolism and transcription. however, the only functional category where this is statistically significant from the clones evolved at ph  <dig>  is carbohydrate transport and metabolism . indeed, each of the clones evolved at ph  <dig>  have a mutation in at least one gene encoding for an enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism, while none of the clones evolved at ph  <dig>  have a mutation in a gene involved in carbohydrate metabolism. the other functional categories are those where mutations were only found in the clone with a mutation in uvra . a few clones evolved at ph  <dig>  also have mutations in genes involved in denitrification that were not observed in clones evolved at ph  <dig>  . in conclusion, evolution at ph  <dig>   led not only to the accumulation of more mutations but also to the accumulation of mutations with increased diversity of functional annotations.fig.  <dig> functional categorization of genes that contain mutations in evolved clones for each experimental evolution condition. each mutation was categorized by type. data are presented as tukey box-plots. functional categories : s, function unknown; n, cell motility; t, signal transduction; g, carbohydrate transport and metabolism; i, lipid transport and metabolism; c, energy production and conversion; p, inorganic ion transport and metabolism; k, transcription; e, amino acid transport and metabolism; h, coenzyme transport and metabolism; l, replication, recombination and repair; o, posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones




populations evolved at increased nitrite reactivity have decreased efficiency in the use of alternative carbon substrates
we finally tested whether the increased numbers of mutations in populations evolved at ph  <dig>   correlates with increased pleiotropic effects under non-selected environments. to accomplish this, we measured the performance of the ancestral and all of the evolved populations when growing on a variety of alternative carbon sources using biolog pm <dig> plates. these plates contain  <dig> individual carbon sources and can be used to measure growth over time. we measured performance as the area under the growth curve  for each carbon substrate as described elsewhere  <cit> . we only took into account those carbon sources for which there was visible growth.

first, we compared the populations evolved at ph  <dig>   with the ancestor grown at ph  <dig>  and the populations evolved at ph  <dig>   with the ancestor grown at ph  <dig>  . we found that populations evolved at ph  <dig>  had no significant overall change in their ability to use alternative carbon substrates when compared to the ancestor; the average of evolvedarea/ancestralarea  does not deviate from one . in contrast, populations evolved at ph  <dig>  had an overall decrease in carbon source utilization; the average of evolvedarea/ancestralarea is significantly lower than one . we also calculated the differences between the two evolution conditions for both the ancestors and the evolved populations; that is, we calculated the average at ph  <dig>  and divided it by the average at ph  <dig>  for each carbon source for the ancestors and for the evolved populations . the average of ph <dig> area/ph <dig> area does not deviate from one for the ancestors, indicating that ph itself has no effect . in contrast, the average of ph <dig> area/ph <dig> area is significantly lower than one for the evolved populations, indicating that evolution at ph  <dig>  does indeed have negative consequences on the utilization of non-selected substrates . taken together, our data support the conclusion that the increased accumulation of mutations at ph  <dig>  led to increased antagonistic pleiotropic effects in non-selected environments. this is likely due to the increased accumulation of mutations in carbohydrate utilization and transport genes at ph  <dig> , which may have negative effects on the ability of those evolved populations to utilize alternative carbon substrates.fig.  <dig> performance of evolved and ancestral clones to utilize alternative carbon substrates. carbon utilization was measured for  <dig> different carbon substrates. performance was quantified as the area under the growth curve for each individual carbon substrate , which takes into account both growth rate and yield. data are presented as histograms.  comparison of clones evolved at ph  <dig>  with ancestral populations at ph  <dig> ;  comparison of clones evolved at ph  <dig>  with ancestral clones at ph  <dig> ;  comparison of ancestral clones at ph  <dig>  with ancestral clones at ph  <dig> ;  comparison of clones evolved at ph  <dig>  with clones evolved at ph  <dig> 




discussion
our results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased toxicity of a single metabolic intermediate can accelerate the pace of molecular evolution, and this leads to larger increases in both absolute and relative fitness. we conclude that the increased rate of evolution is most likely due to the increased availability of mutations with large beneficial effects that selection can act upon rather than an increase in the mutation rate in response to stressful conditions, the latter of which has been repeatedly observed  <cit> . this is based on evidence that there is no increase in synonymous mutations at strong nitrite toxicity  and further supported by the fact that the additional mutations that accumulated during evolution at strong nitrite toxicity do not confer a significant additional increase in fitness at weak nitrite reactivity . furthermore, while we identified a single clone with five-fold more mutations than the other clones , this clone did not show improved fitness when compared to the other clones. we note here that differences in ph may have also contributed towards the different outcomes, but we believe this is unlikely given that differences in ph over the experimentally evolved conditions have no observable effect on the growth of p. stutzeri  <cit> .

the larger increases in fitness observed after evolution at strong nitrite toxicity were due to two mechanisms. the first mechanism is that the fitness benefits of mutations in genes encoding for certain functions had larger beneficial effects as nitrite toxicity increased. we base this conclusion on the fact that clones evolved at weak nitrite toxicity share mutations in genes with similar functions with clones evolved at strong nitrite toxicity, including mutations in genes involved in cell motility , signal transduction , and in genes encoding for membrane proteins  . this suggests that there are adaptations common to both conditions. yet, the clones evolved at weak nitrite toxicity have larger increases in competitive fitness when grown at high nitrite toxicity than at low nitrite toxicity , suggesting that the adaptations common to both conditions have larger benefits at stronger nitrite toxicity. this idea that the benefits of mutations can be larger  in a less fit background is consistent with several previous studies. for example, a recent study with yeast demonstrated that beneficial mutations have larger benefits in more stressful backgrounds, where the initial fitness was determined by the genotype rather the environment  <cit> . as another example, mutations conferring antibiotic resistance have larger benefits at higher antibiotic concentrations  <cit> . thus, in the case of nitrite toxicity, mutations in certain functions have beneficial effects at both weak and strong nitrite toxicity, but those benefits increase as toxicity increases.

the second mechanism is that mutations emerged that are only beneficial at strong nitrite toxicity. that is, populations evolved at strong nitrite toxicity have larger increases in competitive fitness than populations evolved at weak nitrite toxicity when competed at strong nitrite toxicity . additionally, populations evolved at strong nitrite toxicity have no significant difference in the increase of competitive fitness compared to populations evolved at weak nitrite toxicity when competed at weak nitrite toxicity . this idea is further supported by the fact that mutations in genes encoding for proteins involved in carbon metabolism  and in denitrification were only identified in clones evolved at strong nitrite toxicity . these results indicate that mutations in functions such as carbon metabolism and denitrification only have beneficial effects at strong nitrite toxicity.

our data additionally demonstrates that increased nitrite toxicity not only accelerates molecular evolution, but also reduces the niche breadth of the cells. we found that the increase in the number of mutations during evolution at strong nitrite toxicity led to increased antagonistic pleiotropic effects in non-selected environments, as demonstrated by the decrease in utilization efficiency of alternative carbon sources . while statistically significant, we caution that these results may not be biologically significant, as the effects are typically small for many of the alternative carbon sources. however, the fact that all lineages evolved at strong nitrite toxicity have mutations in important enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis supports the idea that carbon utilization would be affected in these lineages. this suggests that evolution at increased nitrite toxicity leads to increased metabolic specialization and decreased niche breadth. this decrease in niche breadth may not be unexpected, as there is some evidence supporting the idea that adaptation to more stressful environments leads to increased trade-offs in non-selected environments  <cit> . given the large numbers of substrates and intermediates that are present in the natural environment, metabolite toxicity may therefore be an important factor that limits niche breadth and, in turn, promotes biodiversity and the coexistence of different metabolically specialized genotypes. it could therefore provide a partial explanation for the extraordinary levels of microbial biodiversity present in many environments.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that toxic metabolites can have important impacts on the evolutionary processes of microbial cells. given the ubiquity of toxic metabolites, they have implications for understanding the evolutionary histories of biological organisms. finally, because an increased pace of evolution correlates with reduced niche breadth, the production of toxic metabolites may help to explain the enormous amount of microbial diversity in the natural environment.
