BACKGROUND
carbon and light are two important and interdependent signals that regulate plant growth and development. one mechanism by which these signals exert their effects on plants is through their ability to affect the expression of a large number of genes through signal transduction cascades. while much is known about how plants respond to and transduce light signals  <cit> , less is known about the perception and transduction of carbon signals  <cit> . moreover, while carbon and light signaling pathways influence one another via "crosstalk"  <cit> , nothing is yet known about the molecular components that might link these two signaling pathways.

microarray studies have been used to investigate the integration of multiple inputs such as carbon and nitrogen  <cit> , carbon and hormones   <cit>  as well as carbon and circadian rhythms  <cit> . these studies demonstrate that the carbon-regulated genes are representative of a diverse range of biological processes, such as metabolism , energy, protein synthesis and stress , among others. microarray studies have also been used to investigate the genes and encoded biological processes that are subject to a significant degree of regulation by light and carbon interactions in light-grown arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> . results from our previous study revealed that the majority of genes analyzed  showed regulation by light and carbon interactions. furthermore, functional category analysis revealed that genes in the biological process "metabolism", were significantly controlled by the interaction of carbon and light in light-grown plants  <cit> . other studies of carbon and light interactions have shown synergistic or antagonistic relationships between light and carbon signaling on a gene-by-gene basis  <cit> . for example, genes related to photosynthesis are strongly induced by light, yet repressed by carbon treatment   <cit> . for other genes, the effects of carbon are distinct in the presence or absence of light. for example, a number of genes involved in n-assimilation  are induced by carbon in dark-adapted plants  <cit> , but are repressed by carbon in light-treated plants  <cit> . more specific interactions between carbon and light signaling have been observed by the ability of carbon to suppress a far-red/phytochrome a-specific, light-induced block of greening  <cit> . here, carbon may antagonize or suppress a phytochrome a signaling pathway.

a number of studies have used genetic approaches to identify genes involved in light or carbon signaling. some genetic screens have focused on the isolation of arabidopsis mutants involved in carbon signaling  <cit>  or in light sensing and signaling  <cit> . several of these genetic studies have used light signaling mutants to test the influence of carbon treatments on phytochrome signal transduction pathways  <cit> . thus far, there have been no reports of the isolation of mutants identifying components that mediate or mechanisms involved in the signaling interactions between carbon and light signaling.

in this study, a carbon and light insensitive  mutant is identified and its molecular defects characterized on a genome-wide scale, using a multinetwork approach to identify the genes, biological processes and regulatory/metabolic networks affected in the cli <dig> mutant. the multinetwork analysis of microarray data reveals connections between metabolic and regulatory networks that are perturbed in the cli <dig> mutant that could only be discovered via this integrated network analysis. this combined genetic, genomic and network analyses of a carbon and light insensitive  mutant described herein, identifies cli <dig> as a putative major regulatory gene that integrates carbon and light signaling to control a downstream network of metabolic and regulatory genes in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
a positive genetic selection for carbon and light insensitive mutants 
in previous studies, it has been shown that the asparagine synthetase  gene in plants is transcriptionally repressed by transient treatments with sucrose and/or light, where both light and sucrose together have a synergistic repressive effect  <cit> . to identify genetic components involved in the integration of light and carbon signaling, the asn <dig> promoter was used in a positive genetic selection, designed to identify mutants defective in the transcriptional repression of the asn <dig> gene by both light and carbon. an arabidopsis line was created that contained a transgene in which a 148-bp region of the asn <dig> promoter from pea was placed upstream of the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene   <cit>  . as light and carbon treatments repress expression of asn <dig> in the light on carbon-containing media, the asn1::hpt <dig> lines whose growth was suppressed under these conditions were selected for mutagenesis. a similar positive genetic selection scheme using the reporter gene construct, cab3::hpt <dig> was used in the isolation of the dark overexpression of cab mutants , which identified genes controlling expression of the cab <dig> gene  <cit> .

seeds from one transgenic asn1::hpt <dig> line  <cit>  were mutagenized using either fast neutron irradiation or ems . m <dig> mutagenized seeds were germinated and grown in the light on media containing 1% sucrose and  <dig> Î¼g/ml hygromycin. putative carbon and light insensitive  mutants showing a loss of asn1::hpt <dig> transgene repression by light and carbon treatments were selected, based on their degree of resistance to hygromycin . hygromycin-resistance was determined by increased root length, greening of primary and secondary leaves and overall enhanced growth over a period of three weeks, when compared to the un-mutagenized wild-type transgenic asn1::hpt <dig> parental line .

from an initial screen of approximately  <dig>  m <dig> fast-neutron irradiated asn1::hpt <dig> seedlings , one line, cli <dig>  retained a consistent hygromycin-resistant phenotype past the m <dig> generation . a screen of approximately  <dig>  additional m <dig> seeds from  <dig> m <dig> ems mutagenized asn1::hpt <dig> lines identified  <dig> additional putative cli mutants  <cit>  that retained a consistent hygromycin phenotype beyond the m <dig> generation, two of which are shown in figure 1b, cli12-2- <dig> and cli16- <dig> 

asn <dig> egulation by carbon and light is disrupted in cli186
as the cli mutant selection was initially based on misregulation of a pea asn1::hpt <dig> transgene, in a secondary screen, it was determined whether the regulation of the endogenous arabidopsis asn <dig> gene was also aberrant in response to light and carbon treatments. plants at two different stages of development were analyzed: etiolated and light-grown. for etiolated studies, plants were grown in the presence or absence of 1% sucrose for seven days in the dark, after which half were maintained in the dark and the other half were illuminated with white light  for an additional three hours. for light-grown studies, plants were grown in 16-h light/8-h dark cycling conditions for  <dig> days on sucrose-containing  media and were thereafter transferred to fresh media containing either no sucrose or 1% sucrose and placed in the dark or white light  for an additional three hours. the change of endogenous asn <dig> transcript levels in response to various transient treatments of light and carbon  were compared in wild-type and cli mutants to confirm light and/or carbon misregulation of the endogenous asn <dig> gene. quantification of endogenous levels of asn <dig> mrna  in the  <dig> cli mutants revealed misregulation of asn <dig> mrna with regard to light and carbon repression, when compared to wild-type . the cli <dig> mutant exhibited the most dramatic misregulation of asn <dig> regulation by light and carbon interactions and was thus selected as the major focus of this genomic/network study.

fold-repression of asn <dig> mrna levels by light/carbon treatments is shown for cli <dig> compared to wild-type for light grown versus etiolated seedlings . when grown in the dark in the presence of 1% sucrose, asn <dig> levels were repressed  <dig> -fold in wild-type. this carbon repression of asn <dig> was reduced to  <dig> -fold in cli <dig> . therefore, carbon regulation of asn <dig> in etiolated seedlings is impaired approximately 10-fold in cli <dig> mutants as compared to wild-type plants. repression of asn <dig> mrna levels in response to light only treatments was similar in wild-type and cli <dig> , suggesting that light regulation of asn <dig> is not impaired in cli <dig> . intriguingly, the interaction of light and carbon repression of asn <dig> is dramatically perturbed in cli <dig>  as levels of asn <dig> mrna are repressed  <dig> -fold in wild-type, compared to  <dig> -fold in cli <dig> . thus, the regulation of asn <dig> by the interaction of light-and-carbon was significantly disrupted  in cli <dig>  compared to wild-type when assayed in etiolated plants.

fold repression of asn <dig> mrna levels by light and carbon treatments was also determined in 14-day old light-grown plants . when light-grown plants were transiently treated with 1% sucrose in the dark, asn <dig> mrna levels were similarly repressed in wild-type  and in cli <dig>  . in light only treatments, the fold repression of asn <dig> mrna was also similar between wild-type  and cli <dig> . again there were differences observed in asn <dig> mrna levels in plants treated with the combination of light plus carbon in wild-type  versus cli <dig> . thus, although not as dramatic as that observed for etiolated seedlings, the regulation of asn <dig> by the interaction of light-and-carbon remained disrupted in cli <dig> in light-grown seedlings when compared to wild-type.

these results confirm that in wild-type seedlings, the combination of light and carbon together repress asn <dig> mrna levels  <dig> -fold in etiolated seedlings and 129-fold in light-grown plants, which being more than the sum of the two factors individually in either developmental state is indicative of a synergistic light/carbon interaction. interestingly, this synergistic interaction of light and carbon in the regulation of asn <dig> was dramatically lost in the cli <dig> mutant, specifically when monitored in etiolated seedlings . thus, investigation of the cli <dig> mutant should aid in elucidating the mechanism underlying the interaction between light and carbon signaling, and how this intersects with loss of carbon only signaling in etiolated plants .

genomic microarray analysis of wild-type and cli <dig> seedlings
microarray analysis combined with systems biology tools was used to determine which genes, biological processes and gene networks are targets of light/carbon signaling interactions in wild-type and which of these networks are disrupted in the cli <dig> mutant. affymetrix whole genome ath <dig> chips were hybridized with crna made from rna isolated from wild-type and cli <dig> etiolated seedlings. plants were grown for seven days in the dark  in the presence or absence of 1% sucrose and subjected to transient light treatments . using this general approach, wild-type and cli <dig> plants were subject to four different light and/or carbon treatments . treatment with no light and no carbon  acted as a control or baseline treatment, to which all other treatments were compared. each of two background treatments  were compared with both replicates for each treatment  which provided a four-way comparison for each of the three treatments. the treatments compared to the background will be referenced in the following manner: c = carbon-only , l = light-only , lc = light-plus-carbon, . genes that responded to the various light and/or carbon treatments  were further identified and classified based on parameters assigned to each gene by microarray suite  <dig>  and using a 'metric' classification system as described in methods.

data analysis from gene chips performed on wild-type and cli <dig> mrna was carried out simultaneously to classify genes based on their regulation by light and/or carbon across all  <dig> comparisons . three filters were applied to the initial dataset to identify the subset of genes for further analysis. to eliminate probes for genes that could not be reliably compared between treatment and baseline due to poor detection from either low expression or aberrant hybridization, filter  <dig> was applied to eliminate probes with "absent" detection calls in both treatment and baseline hybridizations. to include probes representing genes that are expressed at a low level, probes whose expression was low but detectable  was compared with those probes that were 'absent' in the treatment or the baseline hybridization. thus, filter  <dig> included probes with an "absent" call in treatment or baseline if the "present' probe in the other hybridization had a signal value of  <dig> or greater. to ensure high reproducibility of genes within our dataset, filter  <dig> was used to include genes in which the difference calls in  <dig> out of  <dig> comparisons between treatment and baseline in wild-type and mutant were consistent  as provided by the affymetrix microarray suite  <dig>  software. thus, genes that performed reproducibly 75% of the time were included in the dataset. when applied to the wild-type and cli <dig> dataset over all  <dig> comparisons  =  <dig> comparisons), these rigorous filtering steps removed probes corresponding to  <dig>  genes, leaving  <dig>  genes that showed consistent reliability for further analysis. this final filtered dataset of  <dig>  genes is thus stringent and reliably reproducible across all the comparisons examined. these  <dig>  genes were further analyzed below to determine what patterns of regulation by light and/or carbon were found in wild-type and cli <dig> seedlings.

identification of  <dig> genes regulated by light and/or carbon in wild-type and  <dig> genes misregulated by light and/or carbon in cli186
in order to identify misregulated genes in the cli <dig> mutant, a 'metric' classification system  was designed to organize the filtered genes into classes based on their relative expression profiles across all three types of treatments: l, c, lc. the classification system uses a statistical approach to determine those genes that are regulated by light and/or carbon in wild-type, and that show different responses  in the corresponding experiments in the cli <dig> mutant. anova analysis was used to compare gene regulation across all three treatments , for both wild-type and cli <dig>  multiple testing was addressed by controlling the false discovery rate at 5% as previously described  <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig>  "reliable" genes did not show significant differences across any of the three treatments  when comparing wild-type or cli <dig> responses. in contrast,  <dig> of the  <dig>  genes changed significantly in at least one treatment  in wild-type or cli <dig>  suggesting interactions of light and carbon or an altered response to the light and/or carbon treatments in the cli <dig> mutant. a list of genes and their classes that are light/carbon regulated in wild-type and cli <dig> is included . a list of the  <dig> light/carbon regulated genes in wild-type and the  <dig> misregulated genes in cli <dig> is included . closer inspection of the resulting patterns of regulation revealed  <dig> genes that were misregulated in cli <dig> in light and/or carbon treatments when compared to wild-type. a total of  <dig> genes  are regulated by all three treatments  in wild-type and exhibit either normal regulation  or misregulation by light and/or carbon in cli <dig> . of the remaining  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes  are regulated by lc only, and  <dig> genes  are regulated by l-only and c-only in wild-type . moreover,  <dig> genes  that are not regulated by l/c in wild-type, are regulated in any one or combination of l and/or c treatments in cli <dig> . in total, of these  <dig> light/carbon regulated genes in wild-type,  <dig> are misregulated in cli <dig> in any one or combination of light and/or carbon treatments . patterns of misregulation observed among the  <dig> misregulated genes in cli <dig> is included .

the l/c patterns of misregulation in cli <dig> that are perturbed in a l and c interaction are in bold.

although cli <dig> shows misregulation of genes in a number of light and/or carbon treatments and combinations thereof, the most common pattern of misregulation corresponded to genes specifically misregulated in lc treatments only . this suggests that cli <dig> may be a mutant defective in a component that integrates light and carbon sensing and/or signaling. additionally, cli <dig> contains 41/ <dig> genes  that are misregulated in l and lc treatments, 7/ <dig> genes  that are misregulated in c and lc treatments, 31/ <dig> genes  that are misregulated in the l-only treatment, and 36/ <dig> genes  that are misregulated in the c-only treatment . genes that exhibit misregulation in l-only but not in lc treatments, indicate that the carbon signaling pathway antagonizes the light pathway, thus an interaction between light and carbon pathways is present. a similar rationale is applied to those genes that are misregulated in the c-only treatment, but not in lc treatments. thus, of the  <dig> misregulated genes in the cli <dig> mutant,  <dig> genes or 75%  exhibit misregulation specifically in response to an interaction between light and carbon signaling, further supporting the hypothesis that cli <dig> is defective in a component that integrates light and carbon sensing and/or signaling.

to complement and further validate the 'metric' classification system analysis, an anova analysis was used determine the genes regulated by either c and/or l in wild-type and the cli <dig> mutant . this 3-way anova was carried out with three dichotomous categorical variables . the p-values were then corrected for multiple testing using a fdr correction at 5%. of the  <dig>  genes comprising the filtered dataset, we find  <dig>  regulated genes and of those,  <dig> are misregulated in the cli <dig> mutant . there is a significant overlap of genes among the two analysis methods employed. for example,  <dig> regulated genes and  <dig> misregulated genes are shared among the two datasets . as this 3-way anova analysis provided similar results as the 'metric' classification system, we carried out all further analyses in this study using the  <dig> regulated genes and  <dig> cli <dig> misregulated genes obtained from the 'metric' classification analysis, a method previously used for the classification of microarray datasets  <cit> .

genes in the biological processes energy and metabolism are regulated by light and/or carbon in wild-type but misregulated in cli186
the  <dig> l/c regulated genes in wild-type and the  <dig> l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig> were categorized using functional classification terms to determine which biological processes are significantly over-represented in this group of genes. functional assignments of genes were based on annotations provided by the munich information center for protein sequences  arabidopsis thaliana database  <cit> . the over-representation of mips terms in the gene lists, "l/c regulated ", "l/c misregulated " were compared to the entire arabidopsis genome using the biomaps tool for visualization and statistical analysis, using a p value â¤  <dig>   <cit> .

this table shows the functional categories  annotated by mips  <cit>  that respond to light and/or carbon among the  <dig> l/c regulated genes in wild-type  and  <dig> l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig>  the funcats are arranged according to their hierarchy as indicated by their numerical category. p-values to determine the significance of the funcats among the subsets of genes are shown in the columns labeled, 'l/c regulated' and 'l/c misregulated' in panels ,  and . the p-values for the funcats that are significantly over-represented among both the l/c regulated genes in wild-type and the l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig> are in bold in panels ,  and . the p-values for the funcats that are in normal text indicate those funcats that show over-representation among the 'l/c regulated' or the 'l/c misregulated' groups of genes in all panels, ,  and . dashes indicate no significant representation of the funcat among the groups of genes. over-representation of mips terms in the gene lists were compared to the entire arabidopsis genome ,  or to the arabidopsis multinetwork  using the biomaps tool for visualization and statistical analysis, using a p value â¤  <dig>   <cit> .

l/c regulated genes in wild-type form a highly connected and complex metabolic and regulatory network that is disrupted in the cli <dig> mutant
we next analyzed the microarray data in a multinetwork context to accomplish the following three goals: 1) to understand how the l/c regulated genes  in wild-type are connected to each other from a network perspective, 2) to help understand/identify hubs that may control such a large number of genes in concert, and 3) to determine how the cli <dig> mutation perturbs this network. integrated metabolic and regulatory networks were created using an arabidopsis multinetwork tool developed by gutierrez et al.  . this multinetwork allowed us to use a systems biology approach to identify the metabolic and regulatory interactions affected by the different treatments used and to see how these interactions are changed or perturbed in the cli <dig> mutant. all  <dig> l/c regulated genes in wild-type were used to query this arabidopsis multinetwork. of the  <dig> l/c regulated genes in wild-type,  <dig> genes were present in the highly connected multinetwork . the remaining  <dig> genes are not yet represented by connections in the multinetwork database. to determine if the presence and connectivity of the  <dig> genes in this l/c network are significant,  <dig> genes were selected at random from the arabidopsis genome  <dig>  times, and asked how many times a network of  <dig> connected genes or more could be recapitulated . in no cases out of  <dig>  randomizations, was a connected network of  <dig> genes or more recapitulated when randomly selecting  <dig> genes from the arabidopsis genome . thus, a subset of  <dig> l/c regulated genes from wild-type form a significantly connected component of the l/c interaction network.

with the l/c network of  <dig> genes in place for wild-type arabidopsis, the genes in this network that are misregulated in cli <dig> were identified, so as to identify the sub-networks and biological processes disrupted by the cli <dig> mutation . of the  <dig> l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig>   <dig> genes are present in the large connected wild-type l/c multinetwork of  <dig> genes. again, the significance of the degree of presence  and connectivity of the l/c misregulated genes in the large wild-type multinetwork was determined . both the presence of and connectivity among the  <dig> l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig> within the wild-type multinetwork is significant .

to gain an overview of the biological processes that are represented among the  <dig> connected genes  in the l/c gene network in wild-type and the subset of  <dig>  l/c misregulated genes also present in this network, a funcat  analysis using the mips annotations was carried out on these lists of genes, "l/c regulated " and "l/c misregulated " . over-representation of mips terms in the gene lists, "l/c regulated " and "mis-regulated " were compared to the  <dig>  gene nodes represented in the arabidopsis multinetwork  <cit>  using the biomaps tool for visualization and statistical analysis, using a p value â¤  <dig>   <cit> . this analysis revealed that the sub-funcat, "photosynthesis" is the only over-represented term among the l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig> . the over-representation of only one sub-funcat is found because the  <dig>  gene nodes from the arabidopsis multinetwork  <cit>  was used as the background to determine over-represented funcats within the gene lists, "l/c regulated " and "l/c misregulated ". as the arabidopsis multinetwork is not complete, there may be a bias of biological processes represented within the multinetwork. thus, using the arabidopsis multinetwork  <cit>  instead of the entire arabidopsis genome as a background for comparison of over-represented terms among the lists of genes, "l/c regulated " and "misregulated " accounts for this possible bias.

although the current version of the arabidopsis multinetwork is extensive, containing  <dig>  gene nodes,  <dig>  metabolite nodes and  <dig>  interactions, it is not complete. thus, many genes and their interacting partners are not represented in the multinetwork. to determine which biological processes are represented among those genes that are not represented in the arabidopsis multinetwork, a mips functional category analysis was carried out . this analysis revealed that genes in the biological processes, "respiration" and "aerobic respiration" are over-represented in the genes not present in the multinetwork, which include the  <dig> l/c regulated genes in wild-type and the  <dig> l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig>  interestingly, the biological processes, "energy", "photosynthesis", "plastid" and "chloroplast" are over-represented among the  <dig> l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig>  thus, the biological processes, "respiration" and "aerobic respiration" are additional processes that are also regulated by l/c in wild-type and misregulated by l/c in cli <dig>  but not yet defined by the network analysis. furthermore, the funcats "energy", "photosynthesis", "plastid" and "chloroplast" are processes that are l/c misregulated in cli <dig>  but not yet defined by the network analysis.

supernode network summarizes multinetwork of l/c regulated processes in wild-type and l/c misregulated processes in cli186
to gain an understanding of how the various processes regulated by l/c in wild-type seedlings are connected to each other, and to determine which of these processes are perturbed by the cli <dig> mutation, a supernode network was created . supernodes are created by collapsing multiple genes from a multinetwork into a single node, according to their annotation. for example, all genes annotated to the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways are summarized in the network with a single node labeled "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis". the size of the node is proportional to the number of genes annotated to the corresponding node label. gene edges from the large multinetwork are transferred to the supernode, and are summarized in the final supernode network by a single edge type between supernodes. the connectivity of the nodes are supported by edges that may be metabolic , protein-dna  or protein-protein  interactions or combinations thereof. hence, this supernode analysis provides a summary of the biological processes that are l/c regulated in wild-type and those that are perturbed by the cli <dig> mutation and the connections between these processes.

the supernode network , shows that the supernodes containing the largest number of genes that are under regulation by l/c interactions in both wild type and cli <dig> include: "zinc finger", "benzoate degradation via coa ligation", "valine, leucine, isoleucine degradation", "stilbene, coumarine and lignin biosynthesis", "phosphatidylinositol signaling system" and "inositol phosphate metabolism". those processes that contain the largest number of genes and that have at least one l/c misregulated gene in cli <dig> in the supernode include "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis", "nitrogen metabolism", "carbon fixation", "expressed protein", "pyruvate metabolism", "protein kinase", nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism" and "phenylalanine metabolism" . of the  <dig> processes shown as supernodes in the wild type supernode network,  <dig> of them are perturbed by the misregulation of one or more genes in cli <dig>  thus, genes that are misregulated in cli <dig> are functionally associated.

a supernode network was also created using the  <dig> misregulated genes in cli <dig> to visualize the processes that contain the largest number of genes that are misregulated in cli <dig>  to see the number of connections and with which other nodes they are connected . these supernodes, representing biological processes, indicate that the regulation of genes in these processes are perturbed in cli <dig>  the supernodes with the highest number of genes misregulated by l/c in cli <dig> include, "nitrogen metabolism", "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis", "carbon fixation" and "expressed protein". prominently, within this supernode network of cli <dig> l/c misregulated genes is a homeobox leucine zipper protein connected via protein-dna connections to the supernodes that represent metabolic processes such as "nitrogen metabolism", "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis" and "carbon fixation" among others. within this supernode network there are additional proteins with dna binding and/or transcriptional activity but do not exhibit the striking connectivity of the homeobox leucine zipper protein .

a homeobox-leucine zipper transcription factor  integrates metabolic networks
to gain a gene-by-gene network view of the connectivity of the  <dig> l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig>  the  <dig> genes were used to directly query the arabidopsis multinetwork  . a number of interactions are visualized within this sub-network including:  metabolic networks  protein:protein interaction networks and  protein:dna regulatory interaction networks  <cit>  . nodes representing genes , genes annotated to be transcription factors  or metabolites  are connected via edges. the type of edge indicates if the interaction is metabolic , protein:dna regulation  or protein-protein interactions . predicted transcription factor target gene edge connections are based on interactions available from agris  <cit> , the interolog and regulogs described previously  <cit>  and the statistical over-representation of the transcription factor binding sites within the target gene promoter and the correlation  of expression of the transcription factor and target gene across all  <dig> experiments . this analysis shows one large network comprised of 60/ <dig> genes, all of which are l/c misregulated in cli <dig> 

the gene network analysis reveals that a number of enzymatically and physically connected genes involved in the biological processes "c-compound/carbohydrate metabolism", "amino acid metabolism" and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis" are misregulated by l/c in cli <dig>  thus, these metabolic processes are likely to be overall perturbed in cli <dig>  moreover, at least one gene in these three 'supernodes' has a regulatory edge connected to hat <dig>  a homeobox-leucine zipper protein  <dig>  the genes that contain regulatory protein:dna edge connections to hat <dig> include asn <dig>  , ppdk  and agt . this network result suggests that hat <dig> may be involved in coordinating the regulation of the target genes in the three related metabolic processes "amino acid metabolism", "c-compound/carbohydrate metabolism" and "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis"  . furthermore, hat <dig> shows additional regulatory edge connections to four other genes, three of which are known regulatory genes , sina , a light-regulated signaling protein ) and one is an unknown gene annotated as an expressed protein . wrky <dig> is one member of the family of wrky transcription factors, sina  is a gene required for r <dig> photoreceptor development in drosophila  <cit>  but whose function is currently unknown in arabidopsis, the light responsive protein is involved in signaling and the 'expressed protein' is annotated as having a gene regulatory function. interestingly, asn <dig>  the gene used to construct the transgenic plants used in the selection of the cli mutants, is included in this cli <dig> gene network and is connected to the hat <dig> hub. strikingly, there are a large number of genes in this network annotated to "amino acid metabolism" and "amino acid degradation", all of which are misregulated in cli <dig>  other genes within this metabolic subnetwork are genes related to or are byproducts of asn synthesis and degradation and include the following: at3g <dig> , at3g <dig> , at5g <dig> , at5g <dig>  and at1g <dig>  synthetase). the misregulation of six of seven hat <dig> target genes in the network have been validated via q-pcr and all of these genes , including hat <dig> itself show misregulation in cli <dig> when compared to wt .

integration of cli <dig> with light signaling mutants
as the genome scale analysis suggests that cli <dig> is specifically impaired in the regulation of genes affected by l/c interactions, it was of interest to compare gene regulation in cli <dig> to other arabidopsis mutants impaired in light sensing/signaling. we compared morphological and molecular phenotypes where applicable, to gain a preliminary idea of where cli <dig> functions with respect to known light signaling mutants. cli <dig> exhibits shorter hypocotyls and opened cotyledons during etiolated growth, similar to other known constitutively photomorphogenic mutants. comparison of the molecular phenotypes of cli <dig> with cop  <cit>  and det  <cit>  mutants reveals that unlike cop and det mutants, cli <dig> does not exhibit induced expression of the rbcl and cab genes in etiolated plants. furthermore, based on microarray analysis, the cli <dig> mutant displayed a loss of light regulation rather than a constitutive light response in the dark based on microarray analysis. as this is more consistent with a mutation in the phytochrome and/or cryptochrome signaling pathways, the growth phenotype of cli <dig> was analyzed alongside the photoreceptor mutants, phya- <dig>  <cit> phyb- <dig>  <cit>  and cry1-304/cry <dig>  <cit>  in various light conditions . cli <dig> exhibited an inhibition in hypocotyl elongation similar to wild-type under all light conditions, whereas the photoreceptor mutants displayed elongated hypocotyls compared to their wild type. these preliminary studies indicate that cli <dig> is not an allele of either the phya, phyb, cry <dig> or cry <dig> mutants .

since it was determined that cli <dig> is not in an upstream component of light signaling , we attempted to place cli <dig> as a downstream component in the context of other known light or carbon signaling pathways by comparing available microarray data from light signaling mutants with microarray data from cli <dig>  we focused on the phya and phyb microarray studies that were the most similar with respect to growth conditions  <cit>  used for the cli <dig> studies described herein. a comparison of genes misregulated by phya and/or phyb  <cit>  with the  <dig> l/c misregulated genes in cli <dig> reveals sixty-eight genes that are shared among the misregulated genes in cli <dig> and the phy data sets. as phya is the predominant phytochrome type in etiolated seedlings, and because the asn <dig> misregulated molecular phenotype of cli <dig> is more pronounced in etiolated seedlings, cli <dig> may function as a downstream component of the phya pathway that integrates l and c signaling pathways. the involvement of cli <dig> in a phya or phyb pathway does not preclude it from also potentially functioning downstream of any of the other photoreceptors. thus, it will be beneficial to investigate cli <dig> in the context of other light and carbon signaling mutants when microarray data becomes available.

discussion
cli186: an integrator of light and carbon signaling interactions
the systems wide studies herein suggest that the cli <dig> mutation blocks the integration of light and carbon signaling pathways that occur in wild-type arabidopsis. furthermore, comparative analysis of microarray data from cli <dig> and phy mutants was used to derive the preliminary hypothesis that cli <dig> functions downstream of a light signaling pathway, that is, at least in part, mediated by phytochrome  and a carbon signaling pathway, mediated by a yet undetermined sensor or modulator . our analysis of gene networks that are misregulated in cli <dig>  combined with a comparative analysis of genes misregulated in phya and phyb mutants enabled us to place cli <dig> in a molecular hierarchy, depicted in figure  <dig>  our hypothesis that cli <dig> acts downstream of phya is also based on the dramatic changes in l/c regulated gene expression observed in etiolated plants. while the misregulation by light and carbon  of asn <dig> expression in light-grown cli <dig> seedlings was modest , it was sufficient to select cli mutants, based on misregulation of the asn1::hpt <dig> construct. since the cli <dig> mutant exhibits delayed greening and problems with seed set , the notion that cli <dig> also plays a role in light-grown seedling development is currently being investigated.

among the  <dig> genes misregulated by l/c in cli <dig>  nine genes are transcription factors or genes with regulatory function, of which six are present in the large l/c multinetwork . hat <dig>  a homeodomain leucine zipper protein is of particular interest, as it appears to be a network hub that is predicated to target the promoters of  <dig> genes in the multinetwork . seven of these  <dig> target genes of hat <dig> are also misregulated in cli <dig> and have been validated via qpcr in their misregulation . the misregulation of hat <dig> in cli <dig> suggests that hat <dig> is a putative transcription factor hub that functions downstream of cli <dig> to integrate l/c regulation of genes involved in metabolic networks related to c-metabolism, n-metabolism and energy, as well as regulatory networks involved in transcription. a number of the genes in these hat <dig> target metabolic networks  are also affected in phya or phyb  <cit>  mutants, supporting the gene network hierarchy of cli <dig> being involved in the integration of l and c signaling as shown in the model in figure  <dig>  it is noteworthy that mips funcat analysis reveals that genes involved in photosynthesis are also over-represented in the list of misregulated genes in cli <dig>  and that a number of these genes are also misregulated in the phya and phyb mutants. the genes involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis are not in the current version of the arabidopsis multinetwork  <cit>  because at present, there are no edges connecting these photosynthesis genes to the rest of the network . this could be because the inferred protein:protein interactions in the current arabidopsis multinetwork are based on experimentally proven protein:protein interactions in worm, fly or yeast  <cit> . thus, a number of genes and/or interactions specific to plants, such as those involved in photosynthesis are not yet represented in the arabidopsis multinetwork. the other five transcription factors, acting downstream of cli <dig>  may regulate genes involved in photosynthesis or other metabolic and regulatory networks that are not represented in the multinetwork or that are not present in the dataset used for the analyses in this report. these transcription factors and their role in the l/c regulation of genes are currently under investigation. the model presented in figure  <dig> is one hypothesized manner in which cli <dig> may act to integrate l and c signaling interactions that best accounts for and fits our analysis and interpretation of the microarray analyses carried out for cli <dig> 

this systems based analysis of the cli <dig> mutant suggests the existence of a master regulator of l/c signaling interactions. furthermore, our network analysis defines hat <dig> as a regulatory hub that plays a major role in integrating the l and c regulation of genes in the biological processes, "amino acid metabolism" and "glycolysis and gluconeogenesis". thus, hat <dig> could hypothetically play the role of cli <dig> as a master regulator however, hat <dig> does not encode the affected gene in cli <dig> based on  the presence of hat <dig> mrna in the cli <dig> mutant ;  the fact that hat <dig> passes the first criteria for filtering of microarray data  and  location of hat <dig> in the genome . although, hat <dig> is ruled out as a cli <dig> candidate, other transcription factors, mirnas or genes with regulatory roles such as those involved in chromatin remodeling, that are not within the scope of this analysis are possible cli <dig> candidates and are currently under investigation. interestingly, of the  <dig> misregulated genes in cli <dig>  almost 80% of them exhibit a dampening of regulation  via the interaction of l and c signaling pathways, suggesting that cli <dig> may be positive regulatory factor.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have taken an integrated genetic, genomic and systems approach to define gene networks that are regulated by the interaction of light and carbon signaling and that are perturbed in cli <dig>  using this approach, we have developed the biological hypothesis that cli <dig> is a regulatory hub affecting the integration of l and c signaling and exerts its effects via downstream transcription factors which in turn regulate genes involved in essential biological processes such as amino acid metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. more common methods used thus far for genome-wide studies in arabidopsis such as cataloging genes based on biological processes and providing gene lists, would not have enabled us to gain a systems biology understanding of how cli <dig> may act to integrate l and c signaling interactions via hat <dig> and other downstream transcription factors. we believe that in addition to elucidating the factors involved in the integration of l and c signaling pathways, that this work may serve as a case study wherein the analysis of genomic data in a systems/network context can help define the role of a mutated gene. moreover, this type of analysis could potentially be used to determine which mutants in a genetic screen are potential network hubs and should be targeted for gene cloning efforts.
