BACKGROUND
brugia malayi  is a causative agent of human lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease that results in elephantiasis and thus disability, handicap, and stigma. over  <dig> million people have lymphatic filariasis, with another  <dig>  billion people at risk of infection
 <cit> . transmission of the disease requires a mosquito vector, which ingests microfilariae from an infected human blood meal. the parasites develop into infective 3rd stage larvae  inside the mosquito and are subsequently transmitted to another human during the next blood meal
 <cit> . efforts at combating the disease include mass drug administration to reduce the blood levels of microfilariae, the transmissible form. this scheme aims only at interrupting further transmission of the disease, as these drugs do not affect adult worms. antibiotics kill all life stages by targeting the obligate mutualistic wolbachia symbiosis, and thus can be used to treat lymphatic filariasis
 <cit> . these wolbachia endosymbionts are α-proteobacteria found in all three of the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis, namely wuchereria bancrofti, b. malayi, and brugia timori <cit> .

during the original whole genome sequencing of b. malayi extensive levels of lateral gene transfer  were identified from its wolbachia endosymbiont, wbm
 <cit> . lgt is the process whereby organisms acquire dna from other organisms in the absence of sex. lgt from the wolbachia genome to the nuclear genome of its eukaryotic hosts is widespread
 <cit> . in a search of the sequence data archives, 20-30% of arthropods and nematodes have evidence for lgt from wolbachia <cit> . more remarkably, 80% of species containing wolbachia had evidence of lgt
 <cit> . of the five species examined further, all of the lgts examined were confirmed experimentally. frequently, wolbachia dna is detected in the host genome
 <cit> , including transfers of >10% of the wolbachia genome
 <cit> . such lgts are called nuwts for nuclear wolbachia transfers following the established nomenclature for numts for nuclear mitochondrial dna segments.

most of the nuwts detected previously in b. malayi are degenerate
 <cit> , suggesting that there is no selective pressure to maintain their functionality. however, the methods used to assemble the b. malayi genome would favor the discovery of degenerate sequences. since the endosymbiont is an obligate symbiont, the nematode genome and bacterial genome were sequenced simultaneously. therefore, to assemble the b. malayi genome, reads that were >98% similar to wolbachia wbm over >90% of their length were removed from the assembly
 <cit> . this leads to the removal of the most conserved sequences. in addition, regions adjacent to nuwts that were removed in the screen, as well as duplicated regions, are unlikely to be well resolved in the assembly. therefore, we sought to quantify the size and number of nuwts in the filarial nematode b. malayi genome that arise from its bacterial endosymbiont, wolbachia sp. wbm. using genome sequencing of wolbachia-depleted worms, we obtained the full list of nuwts in b. malayi. intriguingly, this list includes several full-length wolbachia genes with the potential to be functional that are also shown to generate stage-specific transcripts.

RESULTS
wolbachia depletion of brugia malayi worms and dna sequencing
since b. malayi has a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with wolbachia strain wbm, such that neither symbiotic partner can survive without the other, the b. malayi genome cannot be sequenced without also sequencing the wolbachia genome. this complicates identification of nuwts when compared to detecting wolbachia-host lgt in naturally wolbachia-free nematodes
 <cit>  or insects that can be cured of their wolbachia infection with antibiotics
 <cit> . to overcome this, a wolbachia-depletion approach was undertaken in order to examine worms with low, but not immediately lethal, wolbachia levels.

worms used for sequencing were treated with tetracycline to deplete the wolbachia endosymbionts. a pool of dna was sequenced with a ratio of brugia:wolbachia dna > <dig>  therefore, nuwts should be identified based on a >10-fold difference in coverage relative to coverage of the same sequences in the bacterial genome. more than  <dig> million 54-bp reads were generated from a 3-kbp mate pair library, and over  <dig> million 99-bp reads were generated from a 300-bp paired-end library. given the experimental differences between a 3-kbp mate pair library and a 300-bp paired end library and a significant correlation between the results obtained , the second sequencing strategy provides independent validation of the first. previously, in d. ananassae we observed differences in the coverage for the paired end libraries and the mate pair libraries, with the mate pair libraries having more smooth coverage and the paired end libraries have a great deal of local variance . this was not specifically observed here  although when compared to the paired end reads , the coverage distributions are better delineated for the mate pair reads . taken together, all subsequent analyses used the paired end data, except where noted.

bwa analysis
the sequencing reads generated were aligned against the b. malayi genome 
 <cit>  and the wolbachia strain wbm 
 <cit>  using bwa
 <cit> , a short read aligner that is fast and finds only near-identical matches. as such, this version of bwa is best suited for finding evolutionarily recent nuwts with < <dig> snps/kbp
 <cit> . it also natively allows for analysis of mate pairs that can facilitate mapping nuwts to gaps in the b. malayi genome when one read in the pair is of wolbachia ancestry and the other read is of nematode ancestry, facilitating some downstream analyses. as expected given the wolbachia depletion strategy, the majority of the wbm genome was shown to have relatively low coverage with nuwts having relatively high coverage, comparable to or greater than the mean coverage of b. malayi . more specifically, the mean coverage across wbm was  <dig> × and  <dig> × with the mate pair and paired end reads, respectively. in contrast, and as expected for wolbachia-depleted worms, the corresponding numbers for b. malayi were  <dig> ×  and  <dig> × . this is consistent with the 10-fold depletion anticipated. of note, the mean for the wbm mapping is skewed by the numerous high coverage values obtained for nuwts.

detection of nuwts
the critical coverage for distinguishing between wolbachia and nuwts was determined to be 3× for the mate pair reads  and 16× for the paired end reads , as described in the methods. using these thresholds, the boundaries of nuwts >100-bp were defined relative to the wbm genome using a sliding window approach to smooth coverage variance.

candidate nuwts were covered by  <dig>  mate pair reads and  <dig>  paired end reads . between  <dig> -kbp and  <dig> -kbp of the wbm genome was transferred to the b. malayi genome as determined using the mate pair and paired end reads, respectively. given that the wbm genome is  <dig> -mbp, > <dig> % of it was present in b. malayi as recent nuwts that were detected by bwa mapping of the paired end reads . furthermore, the genes detected were distributed throughout the wbm genome .

acounts also include reads that may not be located in a nuwt themselves as long as their mate is located in one.

experimental verification of nuwt copy number using qpcr
coverage from the paired end data set was deep enough to estimate nuwt copy number. considering that average coverage in b. malayi was 131× , there appear to be multiple copies of specific nuwts in each haploid genome based on coverage . duplication may suggest that these nuwts are playing a fundamental role in the biology of b. malayi, provided that they are functional in b. malayi. copy number variation is linked to phenotypic diversity and evolutionary adaptation
 <cit> . to this end, copy number variation for  <dig> nuwts was verified using qpcr .

* Δct relative to the average ct of six single copy b. malayi genes.

for most of the nuwts, the copy number estimate based on read coverage was very close to the qpcr estimate. when the average coverage was compared to qpcr results, a positive correlation was observed  providing a second independent validation of the coverage estimates. the most notable exception was wbm <dig>  for which only one copy was seen by qpcr but four copies were estimated by coverage on the genome sequence. one explanation may be that multiple fragmented copies add up to four copies, but only one copy is spanned by the qpcr primers used.

size and potential role of transfers
examining the paired end data set in more detail showed that bwa-detected nuwts in b. malayi originated from  <dig> wbm genes . coverage for  <dig> genes was high across their entire length , but the remaining genes were only partially covered, suggesting that only part of the respective wbm gene was detected as a nuwt. frequently, only 100–200 bp of a gene was observed as a nuwt . furthermore, a pattern is seen where only a minor fraction of a gene is present  or the entire gene is present . this suggests that some transfers include full-length genes. however, a substantial number of gene fragments are transferred or many of the full-length genes transferred have decayed yielding gene fragments.

no significant difference  was observed between the frequency of cog functional categories in all nuwts or full-length nuwts when compared to those for wbm. however, genes not classified in any cog category were significantly under-represented in nuwts  relative to the wolbachia wbm genome  .

nuwt location in the b. malayi genome
to examine the insertion sites of nuwts in the nematode genome, we identified read pairs spanning the junction between the nuwt and the portion of the b. malayi genome of nematode ancestry. such pairs representing junctions have one read mapped to the wbm genome and one to the brugia genome. as expected, significantly more junctions were present in intergenic regions and significantly fewer junctions in coding sequences and introns/utrs , although junctions near genes could be identified.

*denotes significant difference . during assembly of the reference genome, sequence reads were removed that had >98% identity to wbm >90% of the length of the read. since the sequences examined here were mapped with bwa, they lack polymorphisms and they likely represent the sequences removed with such criteria as was used for removing wbm sequences prior to assembly. given an overabundance of nuwts near contigs ends, it is likely that some of the gaps in the brugia genome resulted from removal of sequences with near identity to wbm, and that these gaps may be filled with nuwt sequence.

fixed polymorphisms
bwa alignment of hiseq reads against the wbm genome showed that most of the  <dig> nuwts contained at least one single nucleotide polymorphism . a subset of these snps had only one polymorphism and as such, are likely fixed. this suggests that nuwts have been accumulating over recent time in b. malayi.

blastn analysis
we also searched for nuwts of different evolutionary ages using blastn
 <cit> . blastn was selected because it is still relatively fast, but it detects matches with higher levels of polymorphisms when compared to bwa. this makes it more sensitive and suitable for detecting older nuwts. however, blastn does not perform well on short reads and therefore only the 99-bp paired end reads were analyzed in this manner.

blastn was used to detect hits with >80% similarity. while a lower stringency is possible in a blastn analysis, we have found that lowering the stringency in this case yields matches to genes annotated as arising from the mitochondria, or numts. this is a peculiar result given the ancient ancestry of mitochondria and is under further, separate investigation. regardless, this observation also precluded the use of a tblastx-based analysis.

with a coverage cut-off of 16×,  <dig> -kbp  of the wbm genome is identified using blastn, including fragments of  <dig> wbm genes . thirty-two of these genes had their entire length covered by nuwts, making them excellent candidates for downstream functional analyses . like with the bwa-based analysis, no cog category was found significantly different in genes found in nuwts, compared to the complete set of wbm genes .

the blastn analysis greatly increased the fraction of the genome of wbm implicated in lgt events. more specifically, when bwa-detected and blastn-detected lgts are compared to each other, there is an additional  <dig> -kbp of the wbm genome present as nuwts. nuwts in this additional genome portion included new fragments of  <dig> genes. this demonstrates that nuwts have a continuous distribution of nucleotide divergence suggesting that the transfer of wolbachia dna to the genome has occurred over a long time span. it is possible that transfers have occurred since the origin of the symbiosis.

transcriptional activity of nuwts
transcription of nuwts containing full-length wbm genes was examined using publicly available rna-seq data
 <cit> . the b. malayi transcriptome was sequenced in  <dig> samples corresponding to  <dig> different life stages
 <cit> . when sequences from each of these samples were aligned against the wbm genome it was found that up to  <dig> % of the reads were mapped. this finding was unexpected since poly-a selection took place before sequencing
 <cit> , and that step should exclude bacterial transcripts. such rna-seq reads may arise from nuwt transcription. supporting this hypothesis, a comparison of the mean coverage of the nuwt regions to that of the non-nuwt regions showed a small but highly significant difference between them . the ratio of the average coverage for nuwts compared to non-nuwt regions of the wbm genome varied among the thirteen samples from  <dig>  to  <dig> . this statistically significant difference means that transcripts with similarity to wolbachia are more likely to arise from nuwts than from the bacterial genome.

to further validate whether transcripts are arising from the nuwts, the rna-seq data were examined for nuwt-specific polymorphisms . the  <dig> bwa-detected, full-length nuwts were particularly interesting since they were more likely to have retained some function. fourteen of them had strong evidence for transcription in at least one life stage, when examining nuwt-specific snps . more specifically, for some wolbachia wbm genes all reads found contained only the nuwt-specific snp, which means that transcription comes only from the nuwt copy of that gene .

subsequently, transcription levels were calculated as rpkm values
 <cit>  for each of these  <dig> genes. stage-specific expression is seen with wbm <dig> transcribed in l <dig> larvae and wbm <dig> and wbm <dig> transcribed in eggs/embryos . all three genes are annotated as hypothetical proteins.
 <cit> . blue represents no expression and red represents the most expression with six stages examined: ee, eggs and embryos; im, immature microfilariae; mm, mature microfilariae; l <dig>  3rd stage larvae; l <dig>  4th stage larvae; am, adult males; af, adult females. wbm <dig>  is highly transcribed in l <dig> stage infective larvae, and wbm <dig> and wbm <dig> are highly transcribed in eggs/embryos.  four genes were shown to be constitutively expressed and were subsequently used in experiments to validate the results with wbm0693: green, bm1_ <dig>  ribosomal protein l16; purple, bm1_ <dig>  40s ribosomal protein s27; blue, actin; red, tph-1; black, average.  relative abundance of the nuwt originating from wbm <dig> is illustrated relative to the average of the four control genes from panel b . the amplified region of the nuwt contains two snps that differentiate the nuwt copy of the gene from the wolbachia copy allowing the percentage of the clones containing high-quality, nuwt-specific snps  and the percentage of positions containing high-quality, nuwt-specific snps  to be calculated. the vast majority of the transcripts in the l <dig>  l <dig>  male, and female stages originate from the nuwt copy.  the paired end reads generated in this study  and the publicly available rnaseq data  were mapped to the region in the b. malayi genome containing wbm <dig>  the region amplified in the qrt-pcr experiments presented in panels b and c is also illustrated.  genomic features are illustrated for the same region as in panel d.

the nuwt originating from the wbm <dig> gene was further examined using quantitative, reverse transcription pcr  on rna from microfilaria, l <dig>  l <dig>  adult males, and adult females. the qrt-pcr product for wbm <dig> was 16-64× more abundant across all five stages than two hypothetical proteins  that are present as nuwts but only expected to be transcribed by the bacteria based on snps in the transcriptomics sequence. wbm <dig> is 1-32× less abundant than groel, which was not identified as a nuwt, but is an abundant transcript in most intracellular bacteria and was amongst the most abundant wolbachia proteins identified in a proteomic analysis of b. malayi <cit> . wbm <dig> is 2-16× less abundant than the average transcript level for  <dig> constitutively expressed genes , but is of similar abundance to two of these constitutively expressed genes of nematode ancestry .

the analysis of transcription is complicated since the qrt-pcr product could originate from rna from either the bacteria or the nuwt. not only do wolbachia numbers change throughout the nematode life cycle, but transcripts from both origins will have differential transcription through the different life stages. therefore, the wbm <dig> amplicons were cloned and sequenced, and quantification of the nuwt-specific snps was used to identify the relative contributions of the nuwt and bacterial transcripts. while the transcript abundance is lowest in the l <dig> as measured by the ∆ct, 100% of the amplicons arise from the nuwt . in contrast, transcription is high in microfilaria, but most of the amplicons arise from the bacteria . surprisingly, the transcription was high in the l <dig>  males, and females in the qrt-pcr and was predominated by the nuwt-specific alleles. this is contrary to the transcriptomics data, which had higher transcription in the l3s . this could reflect biological or technical differences in the rna obtained for the rnaseq and the qrt-pcr experiments.

the region of the genome that includes wbm <dig> was properly assembled in the original genome sequence, enabling further examination of the transcriptional profile in this region using the rna-seq data. the region between bm1_ <dig>  and bm1_ <dig>  contains two adjacent nuwts that arise from different portions of the wolbachia genome. while the flanking genes of nematode ancestry  have clear transcriptional profiles indicating the intron/exon boundaries and stage-specific transcription , the nuwt containing wbm <dig>  is transcriptionally silent. wbm <dig> is a small hypothetical protein with homology to dnaj heat shock proteins. the other nuwt  is the one transcribed in the l <dig> transcriptomic experiment and contains wbm <dig> and wbm <dig>  which are predicted to encode a hypothetical protein and the 5s rrna, respectively. different regions of this latter nuwt show different transcriptional profiles.

on the right side of this nuwt is a region encoding the bacterial 5s rrna, and it is detected in several stages. since rrna is quite abundant, this level could reflect endosymbiont rrna that co-purified with the polyadenylated rna. the nuwt 5s rrna has a 14-bp insertion relative to the bacterial-encoded 5s rrna. this insertion prevents mapping of sequence reads. in all but the l <dig>  transcription levels drop at this 14-bp insertion, supporting that these reads arise from the bacteria-encoded 5s rrna in all stages except l <dig>  however, the reads from l <dig> contain this 14-bp sequence, supporting that the transcription in the l <dig> is from the nuwt.

on the left side of this nuwt is a region encoding wbm <dig>  the 5′-portion of wbm <dig> is transcribed in numerous stages, but the 3′-portion is transcribed only in l <dig>  the transcription in l <dig> is evident across the entire nuwt and into the adjacent gene, bm1_ <dig>  since the directionality of the transcripts was not assessed in the rna-seq experiments, it is not possible to determine if this transcription results from a promoter activating transcription of the nuwt or if there is alternative splicing of bm1_ <dig> that leads to transcription of this region. the latter would result in anti-sense transcription of wbm <dig> and a chimeric mrna. the former could result in an mrna that codes for wbm <dig> or alternatively could result in transcriptional interference
 <cit> . the resulting protein would be full length but would have a 7-aa insertion.

discussion
lateral gene transfer in eukaryotes is a rare phenomenon, likely because the eukaryotic germline is segregated from the other tissues. this makes the numerous interdomain lgt events found between wolbachia and its eukaryotic hosts intriguing
 <cit> . an advantage wolbachia has in donating dna is that it is found in the reproductive tissues and embryos of its hosts. this means that it is ideally positioned for creating heritable lgt in its eukaryotic hosts. the sizes of known nuwts range from a few hundred bp to the entire wolbachia genome
 <cit> . in this study, we undertook deep sequencing of b. malayi nematode worms and compiled a more complete list of nuwts in b. malayi. such detailed cataloguing of the b. malayi nuwts enabled the study of their potential functionality as well as their frequency.

no particular cog class could be found that was overrepresented in the nuwts. however, genes without a function were under-represented. this former result may suggest that there is no preference for the genes that get transferred and that the entire wolbachia chromosome is potentially transferrable. the latter result may reflect that lgt in wolbachia-nematode systems is rna-mediated. previously, proteomics studies have established that ≥99% of the genes with a function are expressed in the closely related bacteria, ehrlichia chaffeensis and anaplasma phagocytophilum, while only ~80% of hypothetical proteins are expressed
 <cit> . if the same is true in wolbachia, this bias in genes with and without a function may reflect that lgt occurs through transcripts, and is rna-mediated, possibly through retrotransposition. this is also consistent with the size of the transfers observed that are similar to the size and composition of bacterial transcripts from operons. this is in contrast to wolbachia-insect lgt, where large chromosomal fragments are frequently found that must be dna-mediated. recently, evidence has been presented to demonstrate lgt from bacteria to the human somatic genome, possibly through an rna-intermediate
 <cit> . this observation in humans correlates well with what is known about the recognition of rna molecules by the human immune system
 <cit> . if such preference for an rna-intermediate in nematodes and a dna-intermediate in insects exists, it would be interesting if it relates to fundamental differences in the nematode and insect immune systems.

potential functionality of nuwts
if nuwts are simply decaying after their integration into the eukaryotic genome, then they will not be functionally significant. we established transcription for several of the nuwts examined, however transcription does not necessarily imply function
 <cit>  and it appears that low-level transcription is common among nuwts
 <cit> . using publicly available rna-seq data
 <cit> , it was found that at least three of the full-length nuwts are transcribed in a life stage-specific manner and at levels that could be biologically meaningful. life stage-specific transcription, as opposed to constitutive transcription, can be an additional indicator of potential functionality
 <cit> .

analyses like gene silencing are needed to conclusively establish if the nuwts are functional. there are several examples of functional nuwts. in the first case, genes of ancestry that may include wolbachia are found in the genome of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, which is a wolbachia-free insect
 <cit> . some of these genes are related to murein metabolism, have acquired spliceosomal introns, and have tissue-specific transcription.

the second case of a functional putative nuwt is that of salivary gland specific  genes of the mosquitoes aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae, which are associated with plasmodium invasion of the salivary glands of female mosquitoes
 <cit> . sgs genes do not have similarity with any other eukaryotic genes in the database, and the only related database sequences with homology are from wolbachia endosymbionts
 <cit> . nuwts in these two systems feature traits that are characteristic of functional nuwts
 <cit> :  longevity after the lgt event,  integration into host genome  and  an associated phenotype .

multiple-copy nuwts
copy number variation has been suggested to be of great evolutionary importance. more specifically, gene copy number facilitates evolution of new variants of a gene and can also affect transcription levels
 <cit> . in this respect, it is interesting that a considerable number of b. malayi nuwts appear to have multiple copies. these copies could result from:  repeated transfers of the same genome fragment,  duplication of nuwts following the initial lgt event, or  some combination of the two. unfortunately, we were not able to reliably deduce the sequence of each copy, which would provide better insight on the underlying mechanism of this copy number variation. it is worth mentioning, however, that in another case of lgt, an increase in copy number of the transferred genes was detected
 <cit> . these extra copies were interpreted as being part of the adaptation process of the host organism to the newly acquired genes. hence, studying the mechanism by which the multiple-copy b. malayi nuwts arose would further elucidate their evolutionary significance and may become possible when new sequencing technologies become available.

potential drug targets
treatment of lymphatic filariasis has recently included drugs targeting wolbachia rather than the nematode itself
 <cit> . however, there is still the need to develop antifilarial drugs that will offer alternative treatment routes. certain nuwts found in the framework of this study contained full-length wbm genes and, thus, could represent potentially functional transfers. more specifically, seven of the genes are interesting because of their putative functions. these genes include wbm <dig> , wbm <dig> , wbm <dig> , wbm <dig> , wbm <dig> , wbm <dig> , and wbm <dig> . intriguingly, the lipoprotein biosynthesis pathway, in which wbm <dig> is involved, has been previously shown to be a valid drug target
 <cit> . in addition, genes wbm <dig>  wbm <dig> and wbm <dig> are of special interest, because transcripts for all three have been detected with differential expression in eggs and larvae . further functional studies using gene silencing are underway to determine if nuwts can be validated as potential drug targets and to further unravel the complexity of wolbachia-filarial symbiosis.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that > <dig> % of the wolbachia wbm genome has been transferred to the genome of its nematode host, b. malayi. a considerable number of wolbachia genome fragments are present in multiple copies in b. malayi. at least  <dig> full-length genes have been laterally transferred. analysis of existing transcriptomics data suggests that three of the nuwts are highly transcribed in specific life stages. taken together, these data suggest that some of the nuwts identified could be functional and may be exploited as potential targets for drug discovery.
