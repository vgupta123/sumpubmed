BACKGROUND
β- <dig> -glucanase catalyzes the hydrolysis of β- <dig> -glucosidic bonds existing in β- <dig> -glucan, which is the main cell wall component of yeast and filamentous fungi, and a major structural and storage polysaccharides  in marine macroalgae, and produced as exopolysaccharide by some bacteria  <cit> . β- <dig> -glucanases are widely distributed among from plants, marine animals, fungi and bacteria. according to the divergence of amino acid sequence, β- <dig> -glucanases from plants are divided into glycosyl hydrolase  family  <dig> while the bacterial enzymes are grouped into gh <dig> family  <cit> . β- <dig> -glucanases synthesized in plants are highlighted because of the plant defense against fungal pathogens. additionally, they also play roles in the normal biological and developmental processes in plants and fungi. in bacteria, β- <dig> -glucanases participate in the degradation of polysaccharides which are utilized as an nutrient source  <cit> .

there has been a great deal of interest in research of bacterial β- <dig> -glucanases. they have shown potential biotechnical applications in structural analysis of yeast and fungal cell wall  <cit> , and preparation of protoplasts  <cit> . β- <dig> -glucanase could also act as a potential biocontrol agent against pathogenic fungi in agriculture  <cit> , and a useful tool to prevent slime production and undesirable yeast growth during vinification in the wine-making process  <cit> . in relation to pharmaceutical application, the soluble β- <dig> -glucan oligosaccharides digested by β- <dig> -glucanase are potential immuneactivators  <cit> . based on the substrates hydrolyzing mechanisms, β- <dig> -glucanases are classified into two types: exo- <dig> -β-d-glucanases  which release glucose residues from the non-reducing end of a substrate, and endo- <dig> -β-d-glucanases  which catalyze the hydrolysis of internal β- <dig> -glucosidic bonds at random sites and release short oligosaccharides  <cit> . there are many β- <dig> -glucanases that have been purified and characterized from different bacterial species, including bacillus <cit> , paenibacillus <cit> , micromonospora <cit> , streptomyces <cit>  and cellulosimicrobium <cit> . proposed physiological functions of bacterial β- <dig> -glucanases vary depending on the source and structure of enzyme  <cit> . in view of the industrial and biotechnological importance of β- <dig> -glucanase, there is of great potential interest in identifying and characterizing novel β- <dig> -glucanases.

in the present study, a novel β- <dig> -glucanase gene was identified by from paenibacillus sp. s <dig>  which was isolated from the rhizosphere of oat plants. the deduced amino acid sequence analysis and homology search revealed that this protein contained an n-terminal leader region, a gh <dig> catalytic domain and a c-terminal domain with ig-like fold. the important role of ig-like domain has been revealed in many cellulases, but little is known about the biochemical properties of ig-like domain in bacterial β- <dig> -glucanases. to investigate the role of the n- and c-terminal domains in enzymatic function, the escherichia coli  expression system of pgla and its truncated mutants was constructed in this study. here, we report the cloning of a new β- <dig> -glucanase gene pgla from s <dig>  the construction and purification of the truncated enzymes, the comparison of the enzymes in terms of their biochemical characteristics and affinities to insoluble β- <dig> -glucans. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that describes function activity relationship between catalytic and non-catalytic domains of a bacterial β- <dig> -glucanase which containing a c-terminal ig-like fold.

gene expression and protein purification
for recombinant protein production, recombinant e.coli bl <dig> cells harboring the expression vectors were first inoculated into lb medium supplemented with kanamycin  and grown overnight at 37°c. then, the culture was transferred into fresh 2 × yt medium  containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and grown at 37°c to an od600 ≈  <dig> , induced with  <dig>  mm iptg and further cultivated for 6-8 h at 25°c. the culture medium was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 10 min at 4°c. cells were washed and suspended in pbs buffer, lysed by sonication on ice and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 20 min at 4°c to remove the cell debris. the supernatant was applied to ni-sepharose  <dig> fast flow column  that had been equilibrated with binding buffer . the protein was eluted using a linear gradient of elution buffer . fractions having the β- <dig> -glucanase activity were pooled and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .

enzyme activity assay and protein determination
the β- <dig> -glucanase activity assay was carried out by measuring the amount of reducing sugars released from a β- <dig> -glucan substrate  according to the  <dig> -dinitrosalicylic acid  method  <cit> . unless otherwise stated, the reaction mixture was incubated at 55°c for 20 min using laminarin  as the substrate in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer . the amount of reducing sugar was then determined spectrophotometrically at 550 nm. one unit  of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release reducing sugars that equivalent to 1 μmol glucose per min under the test conditions. hydrolytic activities toward insoluble substrates were performed by gently mixing reaction mixtures during incubation. then the mixture was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g at 4°c for 10 min. the reducing sugars in the supernatant were measured by the dns method. the protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid  method using the bca protein assay reagent , bovine serum albumin  was used as the standard protein.

enzyme characterization
with laminarin as the substrate, the optimal temperature for β- <dig> -glucanase activity was determined over the range of 30-80°c in sodium acetate buffer . enzyme thermostability was determined by measuring the residual activity after pre-incubation of the enzyme in sodium acetate buffer  at 55°c without substrate for up to 60 min. the optimal ph for β- <dig> -glucanase activity was determined at 55°c in buffers with ph ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the enzyme stability at different ph was estimated by measuring the residual enzyme activity after incubating the enzyme solution in buffers with ph of  <dig> - <dig>  at 4°c for 4 h. the buffers  used were glycine-hcl , sodium acetate , tris–hcl  and glycine-naoh .

the substrate specificity was assayed in reactions with 1% laminarin, pachyman, zymosan a, barley β-glucan, cmc, dextran and  <dig> % salecan under the optimal conditions for each enzyme. the reaction mixture was often oscillated slightly during incubation for insoluble polysaccharides.

kinetic study was performed with laminarin as the substrate under the optimal conditions for each enzyme. the initial velocities under laminarin concentrations  were measured, and the values of km and vmax were obtained from lineweaver-burk plots.

binding assay
binding strength of the enzymes to insoluble polysaccharides was estimated by mixing 15-20 μg of the purified proteins with various substrates  in sodium acetate buffer  at 4°c for 1 h with gentle shaking. binding mixture without substrate was set as control. the binding ability of enzymes containing catalytic domain to insoluble polysaccharides was determined by measuring the residual enzyme activity in the supernatant of the binding mixture. the amount of the enzyme bound to the polysaccharide was estimated by subtraction of the activity recovered from the original activity  <cit> . the binding ability of non-catalytic domain to insoluble substrates was also determined  <cit> . after 1 h of binding reaction, the fraction of protein in the supernatant and the pellet was estimated by 12% sds-page analysis. bsa was used as the negative control and was handled similarly to the other samples.

the nucleotide sequence for the gh <dig> β- <dig> -glucanase gene pgla were deposited in genbank database under the accession number jx <dig> 

RESULTS
cloning of the β- <dig> -glucanase gene and sequence analysis
a β- <dig> -glucanase-encoding gene designated pgla was identified from a 5053-bp fragment which was obtained by using degenerate pcr, i-pcr and sefa-pcr. the deduced amino acid sequence of pgla  comprises  <dig> amino acids with a predicted n-terminal signal peptide  . the mature protein consists of  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated pi of  <dig>  and molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, respectively. the deduced amino acid sequence of pgla exhibited the highest identity  with the hypothetical protein from paenibacillus daejeonensis , 77% identity with the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> protein from paenibacillus lactis  <dig> , and 76% identity with the reported β- <dig> -glucanase bglh from bacillus circulans iam <dig> . pgla showed only 45% identity with the well-characterized endo-β- <dig> -glucanase lama from paenibacillus sp. ccrc  <dig> . combing the results of conserved domain search in the conserved domain database  of ncbi, secondary structure prediction and tertiary structure homology modeling by swiss-model , pgla contains a gh <dig> laminarinase-like domain and a bacterial ig-like domain . the domain organization of pgla is not similar to lama, which include a leader peptide, a threefold repeat of s-layer homologous module, a gh <dig> catalytic module, four repeats of cbm_4_ <dig> and an analogue of coagulation factor fa5/8c from n to c terminus  <cit> . pgla could be considered as a novel β- <dig> -glucanase of paenibacillus species. phylogenetic tree showed that the catalytic region of pgla forms a distinct clade with bglh from b. circulans and putative glycoside hydrolases from paenibacillus species . phylogenetic analysis based on the ig-like domain sequence alignment indicated the relationships between pgla and other ig-like domain containing proteins .

expression of full-length and truncated pgla in e.coli and protein purification
using basic molecular cloning techniques, the gene fragment of pgla without the signal peptide sequence and five truncated mutants were cloned into pet-29a vector and successfully expressed in e.coli bl <dig> . figure 1a represents a schematic overview of the recombinantly produced constructs. the his6-tagged enzymes were purified by affinity chromatography on a ni-sepharose  <dig> fast flow column. molecular masses of rpgla and its truncated mutants rpgla∆c, rpgla∆n, rpgla-cd, rpgla-n and rpgla-c were estimated to be 91 kda, 70 kda, 49 kda, 29 kda, 42 kda and 21 kda, respectively. sds-page analysis indicated protein bands with molecular masses corresponding well to the theoretical values. all the enzymes were purified to a homogeneous state on sds-page . the steps involved in a typical purification process are summarized in table  <dig> 

effects of temperature and ph on the enzymatic activity and stability
the general properties including the optimal ph and temperature of pgla and the truncated derivatives were investigated with laminarin as the substrate. deletion of the n-or c-terminal domain did not abolish the hydrolytic function of β- <dig> -glucanase, thus, enzymatic properties of rpgla, rpgla∆c, rpgla∆n and rpgla-cd were characterized respectively.

effect of domains on thermoactivity and thermostability of rpgla was investigated. side by side comparison of the temperature activity profiles of rpgla and the truncated mutants  showed that, rpgla∆n, the pgla variant containing the catalytic domain and the c-terminal ig-like domain, obviously is the least thermoactive enzyme. it had its highest activity at 50°c, while, rpgla, rpgla∆c and rpgla-cd have a maximum activity at 60°c . this phenomenon indicated that the deletion of the c-terminus increased the optimal temperature. as a dramatic loss of enzymatic stability occurred in the full length enzyme  at temperatures higher than 60°c, the thermal stability was assayed at 55°c for up to 60 min. in conjunction with the temperature optima, also the thermal stability of the truncated derivatives of pgla turned out to be module related. as observed by the thermal stability assay, the absence of c-terminal region is of great relevance for higher temperature stability of the proteins. this can be deduced from the unexpected higher stability of rpgla-cd and rpgla∆c, and lower stability of rpgla and rpgla∆n . these results indicated that truncation of c-terminal domain improved the thermostability of pgla.

deletion of the n-or c-terminal regions had no drastic effect on the optimal ph. for all pgla derived constructs, an apparent ph optimum between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  was observed . rpgla and the truncated enzymes showed broad ph stability. all enzymes retained more than 80% of their original enzymatic activity after 4 h incubation in buffers with ph values between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  . it should be noted that the c-terminal domain deleted mutant rpgla∆c retained higher activity in the acidic range of the ph spectrum  than the other deletion derivatives.

substrate specificity and kinetic analysis
the purified rpgla and truncated enzymes  shared similar substrate specificity. they were highly active toward soluble β- <dig> -glucan  and insoluble β- <dig> -glucan . low activity was detected on soluble linear glucan, barley β-glucan which contains mixed β- <dig> -and β- <dig> - linkages, and salecan which contains mixed β- <dig> -and α- <dig> -linkages, little activity on cmc, dextran and xylan . it was not surprising as β- <dig> -glucan specificity is the general rule for laminarinases. side by side comparison of the specific activity of rpgla and the truncated mutants  showed that, both the n-and c-terminal domains could enhance the hydrolyzing activity of the catalytic module toward insoluble substrates. it was worth noting that rpgla∆c and rpgla-cd show slightly higher activity toward laminarin than rpgla and rpgla∆n. it should be related to the improved thermostability of rpgla∆c and rpgla-cd as the deletion of the c-terminal region.

the kinetic parameters with laminarin as substrate were determined from substrate concentration dependence of velocity. based on double reciprocal plots, the values for the michaelis constant , turnover number  and catalytic efficiency  are calculated and presented in table  <dig>  km values of rpgla, rpgla∆c, rpgla∆n and rpgla-cd were calculated to be  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml, respectively, suggesting that deleting n-and c-terminal domains caused significantly increased km values. the kcat/km values of rpgla∆c, rpgla∆n and rpgla-cd were about 70%, 78% and 35% of that of rpgla respectively. these kinetic parameters indicate that the n-and c-terminal domains increase the affinity of pgla for the substrate  and thus enhance the catalytic efficiency of catalytic module.

binding assay
binding experiments with rpgla and the truncated derivatives and bsa as the tested protein were performed. two approaches were taken to explore the polysaccharide-binding function of the n-terminal and c-terminal regions. first, as for rpgla and the truncated enzymes containing the catalytic domain , residual enzymatic activity in the supernatant of binding mixtures was measured. as shown in figure 5a, the catalytic domain of pgla  had the minimum binding ability compared to the other three enzymes. both the n-and c-terminal regions of pgla had significantly carbohydrate-binding activities. these results were confirmed by the insoluble carbohydrate-binding analysis of rpgla-n and rpgla-c. the n-and c-terminal domain bound strongly to insoluble β- <dig> -glucan , as a large fraction of the protein was retained in the pellet fraction, but not to xylan . presence of insoluble polysaccharide did not affect the amount of bsa in supernatant, excluding the nonspecific binding of insoluble polysaccharide to protein.

discussion
enzymes that hydrolyze insoluble complex polysaccharide structures are usually multi-modular enzymes and composed of distinct catalytic domain and non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules  that play a pivotal role in the action of these enzymes against recalcitrant substrates  <cit> . the presently known cbms are classified into  <dig> families in the latest update of the cazy database . among the  <dig> cbms families classified in cazy, one or more of cbms of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> families have been found in bacterial β- <dig> -glucanases  <cit> . in the work reported here, a novel β- <dig> -glucanase gene pgla was cloned from paenibacillus sp.s <dig>  pgla contains three functional regions: an n-terminal domain, a gh <dig> catalytic domain, and a c-terminal domain with an ig-like structure. even high sequence similarity was found between pgla and the β- <dig> -glucanase bglh from bacillus circulans iam <dig>  pgla possessed a novel ig-like domain which was not observed in bglh by conserved domain search in ncbi. previous reports demonstrated carbohydrate-binding properties of the n-and c-terminal regions of bglh  <cit> , while, the effects of the non-catalytic domain on enzymatic properties of bglh were not described. furthermore, the enzymatic properties of ig-like domain, which is generally considered being involved in carbohydrate binding and commonly found in bacterial proteins  <cit> , have not been illustrated in bacterial β- <dig> -glucanases. we were interested to investigate the functional structural elements of pgla.

it is generally believed that each functional module in a polypeptide can function normally even after separation from an adjacent module  <cit> . the full-length pgla and five truncated derivatives containing one or two modules were constructed, recombinantly produced, purified and characterized. the function of each module referring to carbohydrate-binding and hydrolyzing properties was identified respectively. specific activities of pgla and truncated derivatives on various substrates were measured. the strict and selective specificity of pgla suggested that it was a strict β- <dig> -glucanase belonging to ec  <dig> . <dig>  family of glycoside hydrolases. the truncated mutant pgla-cd, which contained only the catalytic domain, showed reduced hydrolytic activity on insoluble substrates, while, its activity remained unchanged on soluble substrates . it could be suggested that the n- or c-terminal domain did not play a direct or critical role in the structural stability of the catalytic domain. the results of binding assay demonstrated that both the n-and c-terminal domains of pgla had significant binding activities toward insoluble linear β- <dig> -glucan  and branched-chain β- <dig> -glucan  respectively , suggesting their module functions in the enzymatic activity of pgla. it was in accordance with the β- <dig> -glucanase  from bacillus circulans iam <dig>  <cit> . amino acid sequence alignment showed no significant similarity between the n-and c-terminal domains. thus, both of them could be classified into cbm families respectively. either n-or c-terminal cbm could exert the strong binding toward insoluble β- <dig> -glucan , which probably account for the increase of the specific activities of rpgla∆c or rpgla∆n against these insoluble substrates, presumably by assisting the localization of catalytic domains to insoluble polysaccharides.

the full-length pgla and truncated glucanases  exhibited similar enzymatic properties. the ph activity and stability profiles of rpgla and the truncated enzymes were nearly indistinguishable, except that rpgla∆c retained higher activity in acidic range of the ph spectrum  than the other deletion derivatives. the results of thermal activity and stability assay indicated the relatively low influence of the n-terminal cbm on enzymatic properties of pgla. however, deletion of the c-terminus in pgla, consisting of an ig-like fold and a basic terminal domain, significantly increased the thermal tolerance of the enzyme, which was first observed with bacterial β- <dig> -glucanase. these observations imply the negative impact of the c-terminal cbm on enzymatic acidic and thermal stabilities of catalytic domain. a similar negative effect has been identified for endo-β- <dig> -glucanase from bacillus subtilis ja <dig> in that truncation of the cellulose binding domain improved thermal stability of the enzyme  <cit> . carbohydrate binding is not the sole function of the non-catalytic modules  <cit> . the impact of cbms on enzymatic thermal stability of a multidomain xylanase has been discovered by winterhalter et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . increasing literature showed controversial data on cbms affecting glycoside hydrolase’s thermostability. the comparison of catalytic module alone with catalytic module fused to cbm showed either improvement of thermostability  <cit> , or on the contrary appeared to have a negative impact  <cit> . in this report, the negative impact of c-terminal cbm containing an ig-like structure on thermostability as well as acidic stability of β- <dig> -glucanase was revealed.

proteins possessing the ig-like fold are commonly found in bacteria, and are most often involved in cell-cell adhesion, or extracellular glycohydrolysis  <cit> . recent years, there is increasing structural information on the existence of these domains in glycoside hydrolase family proteins. ig-like domain is generally considered being involved in carbohydrate binding and assist in hydrolysis reactions for insoluble substrates  <cit> . the influence of ig-like domain on enzymatic stability and activity of gh family proteins has been mainly illustrated in cellulose hydrolases. liu et al. revealed that deletion of the c-terminal ig-like domains in gh <dig> family cellulose resulted in a significant loss of enzymatic activity toward soluble and insoluble cellulose substrates  <cit> . many members of family  <dig> of glycoside hydrolases have an n-terminal ig-like domain which is responsible for the hydrolytic activity and stability of the catalytic domain  <cit> . tight structural interaction between the ig-like and gh <dig> domains was evidenced by analyzing the crystal structure of the ig-gh <dig> module pair  <cit> . it can be inferred that the c-terminal ig-like structure also physically associate with the active site of the catalytic domain of pgla and hampered the thermal activity and stability of the enzyme. in contrast, the negligible impact of the n-terminal peptide on enzymatic stability and activity indicated it is very likely to fold as an independent structural module and show little interactions with the catalytic module of pgla.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a new β- <dig> -glucanase gene pgla was cloned from paenibacillus sp. s <dig>  truncation forms of pgla were successfully expressed in e.coli. both the n-and c-terminal non-catalytic domains exerted carbohydrate-binding functions, while the c-terminal region containing an ig-like fold had negative impact on thermostability of catalytic domain. there is increasing documentation that the cbms of bacterial glycoside hydrolases containing ig-like structure. as the first report describing the characterization of a gh <dig> β- <dig> -glucanase with an c-terminus ig-like region, the present study improved our understanding on the module relationships between the enzyme’s catalytic and non-catalytic domains and could provide information that may suggest an approach to rationally modify the characteristics of an enzyme for industrial application.
