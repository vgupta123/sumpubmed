BACKGROUND
sequence-specific transcription factors are responsible for processing environmental and developmental signals, and initiating the appropriate cellular response. the total number of transcription factors of an organism increases with its complexity: it is estimated to be around  <dig> for yeast,  <dig> for worms and  <dig> for humans  <cit> . besides a dna-binding domain, another common feature of many transcription factors, such as basic helix-loop-helix  factors and basic-region leucine zipper  factors, is an additional oligomerisation domain   <cit> . a functional role for oligomerisation is easy to rationalize: it combines the dna-binding specificity of individual monomeric domains, leading to a substantial increase in binding affinity. divergence of transcription factor function within a family could originate from evolutionary changes in the dna-binding specificity and in the oligomerisation properties.

a highly important family of transcription factors that play a key role in cell-cycle control and development is that of p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  p <dig> is at the centre of a tumour suppressor network  <cit> , and, as such, is essential for the prevention of cancer  <cit> . both p <dig> and p <dig> are involved in developmental processes. p <dig> is essential for epidermal morphogenesis and limb development, whereas p <dig> is involved in the development of neural structures and the pheromone detection system, among its other roles. nevertheless, p <dig> and p <dig> are also involved in processes controlled by p <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, different functions are also observed even for closely related p <dig> orthologs. for example, genes encoding proteins involved in dna metabolism are responsive to p <dig> in humans but not in mice  <cit> . all three family members consist of a structured dna-binding domain , an oligomerisation domain and intrinsically disordered n-terminal transactivation and c-terminal regulatory domains  <cit> . additionally, p <dig> and p <dig> also contain a structured sterile alpha motif  and an inhibitory domain at the c-terminus  <cit> . the majority of cancer-associated p <dig> mutations are found in the dna-binding domain  <cit> , highlighting the importance of correct dna recognition. p <dig> specifically binds to a  <dig> base pair  consensus dna sequence, also called a response element , consisting of two repeats of 5'-rrrcwwgyyy-3' , separated by 0- <dig> bp  <cit> . in addition, p <dig> also recognises a large number of sequences that deviate from this consensus site definition  <cit> . several studies have shown that p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> can recognise the same sites  <cit> . additionally, each protein has different isoforms  <cit> , which, in most cases, have identical dna-binding domains but exhibit differences in transcriptional activity, adding an additional layer of complexity  <cit> .

despite a high degree of sequence conservation, particularly in the dna-binding and tetramerisation domains, p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> fulfil at least partially different roles. the molecular basis of how closely related transcription factors differentiate between their respective target genes is only poorly understood. here, we characterised the oligomerisation and dna-binding properties of several p <dig> family members. firstly, we determined the dissociation constants for dimers and tetramers of p <dig> family members using analytical ultracentrifugation. we then compared the dna-binding specificity of full-length human p <dig>  with that of its paralogs p <dig> and p <dig>  including the isoforms Δnp63α, Δnp63β, Δnp63γ, Δnp73β and an engineered truncated version of p <dig> containing dna-binding and parts of the oligomerisation domain only . we also compared the dna-binding specificity of human p <dig> with that of its orthologs from a number of species at varying evolutionary distances from humans: mouse , frog , zebrafish  and fruit fly . in these measurements, we included effects of cpg methylation as an additional factor potentially influencing dna-binding specificity. we used a method for quantification of dna-binding specificity which we have recently developed  <cit> . using fluorescence anisotropy titrations, we measured the effect of every possible single base pair substitution of a consensus sequence on the affinity of the proteins for dna. the dna-binding data were then used to identify putative binding sites within the human genome to assess the impact of the differences in dna-binding specificity.

RESULTS
oligomerisation equilibria
we have shown previously that full-length human p <dig> dissociates into dimers at nanomolar concentration, and that oligomerisation is essential for high-affinity dna binding  <cit> . here, we studied the oligomerisation properties of members of the p <dig> family, namely dmp <dig>  drp <dig>  hsp <dig>  mmp <dig>  and xlp <dig>  as well as human Δnp63β and Δnp73β. the p <dig> and p <dig> isoforms contain intact dna-binding and tetramerisation domains. we used sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation  experiments with a fluorescence detection system  <cit> , which allows measurements to be made at low nanomolar concentrations. to specifically incorporate a fluorophore, we expressed proteins with a c-terminal ccpgcc tetra-cysteine tag and labelled them with flash-edt <dig>  an arsenic derivative of fluorescein  <cit> .

the sedimentation profile of hsp <dig> at  <dig>  μm monomer concentration, measured using absorbance detection , showed only one peak at ~ <dig>  s, which we assigned to a tetramer, because the protein has been shown to be tetrameric at this concentration  <cit> . subsequently, we measured the sedimentation profiles of labelled proteins at different concentrations using the fluorescence detection system . at lower concentrations, a second peak appeared at  <dig>  to  <dig>  s. in order to improve the resolution of the sedimentation profiles in the range between  <dig>  and  <dig> s, we repeated our experiments at higher rotor speeds . in addition to the tetramer peak, we were able to resolve two peaks at  <dig>  s and  <dig>  s, which correspond to monomers and dimers, respectively.

all proteins studied formed tetramers which dissociate into dimers. for some proteins, these dimers dissociated into monomers. it was possible to determine their sedimentation profiles with well-resolved peaks, and thus to calculate the dissociation constants kd for the monomer-dimer and dimer-tetramer equilibria . the dissociation constants for the dimer-tetramer equilibria of dmp <dig>  drp <dig> and Δnp73β were in the low nanomolar range. the self-association was about  <dig> times weaker for Δnp63β and about  <dig> times weaker for mmp <dig>  hsp <dig> and xlp <dig>  at low nanomolar concentrations, tetramers of human p <dig> dissociated into dimers, whereas those of human p <dig> and p <dig> readily dissociated into dimers and monomers. in the case of p <dig>  the dissociation constants for momomer-dimer and dimer-tetramer equlibria were similar. for p <dig>  the dimer-monomer kd was even larger than the dimer-tetramer kd. this indicates that only small amounts of p <dig> dimers are present in solution. for human p <dig>  this is not the case, as the monomer-dimer kd is about  <dig> times lower than the dimer-tetramer kd. no monomers were observed for dmp <dig> and drp <dig> 

dna-binding specificity of p <dig> family members is highly conserved
it is often assumed that diverging transcription factors have differences in their dna-binding specificity, which result in preferential recognition of a different response element sequence and an associated change in function. to answer the question of whether the p <dig> response element sequence is evolving and diverging, we compared the dna-binding specificity of human p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  and p <dig> from different species. we used a fluorescence anisotropy assay, which we had developed earlier for quantifying the dna-binding specificity of hsp <dig>  <cit> .

first, the kd between fluorescently labelled dna and protein was measured using direct titrations . data were analysed using the hill equation. the measured kd values were similar for all proteins studied , and observed differences were within the error range of the method. the only exception was p73ct, which bound about 4- <dig> times more weakly than the Δnp73β isoform. weaker binding of p73ct can be attributed to impaired self-oligomerisation due to a truncation of the tetramerisation domain, which has been shown to destabilise the tetramer  <cit> . the hill coefficient n was averaged over all measured datasets , which was in close agreement with the value we have previously reported for human p <dig>  <cit> . in combination with analytical ultracentrifugation data, we can conclude that for all the proteins studied two dimers bind dna cooperatively and form a tetramer, similarly to human p <dig>  <cit> .

afull-length proteins of p <dig>  and naturally occurring isoforms of human p <dig> and p <dig> were used. by contrast, p73ct is not naturally occurring and comprises p <dig> residues 104- <dig>

the driving force for recognition of a specific dna sequence surrounded by non-specific seqences is not the absolute affinity but rather specificity, or the relative affinity for specific vs. non-specific sequences. to define the dna-binding specificity of the members of the p <dig> family, we measured the affinity of the proteins to all possible permutations of a reference consensus binding sequence  using a fluorescence competition titration assay . this sequence contains two identical copies of a ggacatgtcc half-site and is one of the tightest-binding sequences for human p <dig>  <cit> . the results for all the p <dig> homologs analysed are summarised in figure  <dig>  for every nucleotide substitution, the difference of the logarithm of the dissociation constants for the mutated sequence and the reference sequence  was determined. high positive values of Δlogkd indicate high affinity penalties and low probability of observing this substitution in the binding site. the effects of nucleotide substitution are also presented as a sequence logo , which depicts the most preferred nucleotide at a position as the largest letter, and the relative selectivity at this position as the height of the bar. based on the affinity differences, we calculated expected relative nucleotide frequencies for each position, and a corresponding bit score ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . key features of the response element are highly conserved between all the proteins studied. the largest decrease in affinity was caused by nucleotide changes at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  which correspond to the invariant c and g in the rrrcwwgyyy consensus sequence. nucleotide changes at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  corresponding to the central ww element, and positions  <dig> and  <dig>  also caused significant changes in the affinity. generally, changes at the outer positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> did not significantly affect binding. accordingly, the largest contributions to the overall dna-binding specificity are made by positions  <dig> and  <dig>  followed by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the observed changes can be alternatively expressed as a consensus sequence definition . selecting the nucleotide changes resulting in the highest affinity at each position defines the highest affinity sequence. a better reflection of dna-binding specificity is to apply a cut-off value representing the error of the measurement. all nucleotides at a particular position that cause a lower affinity change, Δlogkd, than the cut-off value are treated as having equal binding properties. depending on the cut-off value, a number of different nucleotides can be present at a given position. for example, dmp <dig> recognises the highest affinity sequence gaacatgtcc, which becomes nracatgtmb at a cut-off value of  <dig>  logkd units, and ndacrtgthn at  <dig>  logkd units, where n = any nucleotide; r = g or a; m = a or c; b = g, c or t; h = a, c or t; and w = a or t. as was shown for human p <dig>  <cit> , the observed dna-binding specificity for all the proteins studied is less stringent than the originally proposed definition of the p <dig> consensus sequence rrrcwwgyyy  <cit> .

despite the overall similarities of the dna-specificity profiles, there are also some notable differences. the magnitude of the penalties with respect to the Δlogkd associated with nucleotide changes and the corresponding contribution to the overall specificity of binding varies for different proteins. both mammalian  p <dig> proteins, which had the lowest bit score , showed the lowest specificity. evolutionarily more distant vertebrate proteins  exhibited a selectivity pattern very similar to the mammalian proteins but showed higher bit score values of  <dig>  and  <dig> . approximately  <dig> to 50% of the overall specificity came from positions  <dig> and  <dig>  these positions were even more important for human p <dig> and p <dig> and invertebrate p <dig> , because they contributed  <dig> to 70% to the overall specificity. it is interesting to note that while most proteins prefered the cg motif at the centre of the half-site, p <dig>  p <dig> and dmp <dig> had a slight preference for g compared to t at position  <dig>  recognising the motif cg or cg, depending on the selected cut-off. this observation resonates with findings of osada et al. that p <dig> preferentially recognises rrrcgtgyyy  <cit> , although a at position  <dig> resulted in stronger binding in our experiments. the other interesting feature is that p <dig> favoured g over a in position  <dig>  this is in contrast to findings which suggest an a preceding the cwwg followed by a t forms the most stable complexes with p <dig>  <cit> . it is worth noting that the overall effects of nucleotide substitutions at positions  <dig> and  <dig> were relatively small compared to the effects at the positions  <dig> and  <dig> 

while the isoforms Δnp63β and Δnp63γ behaved almost identically, the isoform Δnp63α showed considerably smaller affinity penalties, meaning it is less specific. interestingly, the dna-binding affinities in the direct titrations and affinities for the reference sequence in competition experiments were similar for all isoforms. this suggests that the presence of the extreme c-terminal post-sam domain in Δnp63α may affect its dna-binding specificity. despite the significantly weaker binding of p73ct compared to Δnp73β to dna, the dna-binding specificity of both p <dig> proteins was identical. this suggests that the dna-binding specificity of tetrameric p <dig> is determined by the dna-binding properties of individual dna-binding domains, whereas the absolute affinity depends on the oligomerisation equilibrium.

dna methylation does not alter the specificity of p <dig> family members
cpg methylation has been shown to affect dna recognition of transcription factors  <cit> . to investigate the effects of cpg methylation on dna recognition of p <dig> family proteins, we used a method that we have previously applied to human p <dig>  <cit> . we systematically introduced a cpg dinucleotide at each position in the consensus p <dig> dna binding sequence and identified substitutions tolerated by p <dig> family proteins. we then compared the binding affinities of methylated versus non-methylated sequences containing cpg . vertebrate p <dig> proteins  behaved similarly to human p <dig> and were mildly affected by substitutions at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, methylated sequences bound somewhat more tightly than non-methylated, although the effect of a single methylation was small. p <dig> and p <dig>  along with invertebrate dmp <dig>  also tolerated cpg nucleotides at these positions. in particular, substitution at position  <dig> hardly changed the affinity, confirming that the cgtc central element of the binding site is recognised equally well as catg, which is preferred by p <dig> 

computational genome analysis
transcription factors recognise a range of sequences which deviate from the highest affinity sequence. as a result of this deviation, the affinity of these sequences can be significantly weaker than that of the highest affinity sequence. we have previously shown that most of the reported p <dig> binding sites have affinity values up to  <dig>  logkd units weaker than the highest affinity sequence, and that there is a very large number of potential binding sites in the genome  <cit> . in this study, the highest affinity sequence was practically identical for all the proteins studied, but the relative penalties for nucleotide substitutions were different. such differential penalties may result in selection of non-overlapping sets of binding sites by different p <dig> family members.

to compare the selected sets of the putative binding sites, we computationally predicted all binding sites in the human genome using our affinity data . we calculated affinity values for every position in the genome , and selected high-affinity ones using laboratory-developed software. firstly, we compared the sets of binding sites predicted for human p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> proteins . as we have shown previously for human p <dig>  <cit> , the number of binding sites increases exponentially with an increasing cut-off value. since the relative specificity of binding, as reflected by the bit-score value, is higher for p <dig> and p <dig> than for p <dig>  there were fewer predicted sites selected at a cut-off value of  <dig>  logkd units. we then determined the overlap between the predicted sets of binding sites, taking into account an error of prediction, ep, of  <dig>  logkd units, which we had determined previously for hsp <dig>  <cit> . for almost all proteins, the overlap was >98% at cut-off values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Δlogkd. the only exception was dmp <dig>  which did not show overlap values higher than 68% with hsp <dig>  remarkably, dmp <dig> showed overlaps close to 100% with Δnp63α. overall, the results of computational analysis suggest that, based on dna-binding preferences alone, all members of p <dig> family bind the same set of putative sites in the human genome. the observed quantitative differences in the binding preferences may result in different affinities toward specific binding site sequences, but not in diverging sets of target sites within a given genome.

discussion
oligomerisation properties of p <dig> family proteins
the tetramerisation domain of hsp <dig>  is highly conserved in all vertebrate proteins of the p <dig> family  <cit> . a sequence alignment of the tetramerisation domain region of proteins used in this study is shown in additional file  <dig>  the hsp <dig> tetramerisation domain forms a dimer of dimers and is composed of short monomeric building blocks consisting of a β-strand followed by an α-helix  <cit> . the primary dimers are stabilized by an intermolecular β-sheet and mainly hydrophobic helix packing interactions. in addition, the primary-dimer interface is stabilised by a salt bridge, which is typical for p <dig> orthologs but not found in its paralogs . the tetrameric interface is formed by hydrophobic helix packing interactions. the hydrophobic interfaces are largely conserved in all the proteins studied except for dmp <dig>  which shows no significant sequence conservation and has a dimer-dimer interface that features a cluster of charged residues at its centre  <cit> . importantly, recent structural studies have shown that the p <dig> tetramerisation domain contains an additional c-terminal helix, which is essential for the structural integrity and stability of the tetramer . this helix is conserved in p <dig> and presumably has a similar structural role  <cit> .

we determined dissociation constants for the monomer-dimer and dimer-tetramer equilibria of seven members of the p <dig> family . hsp <dig>  mmp <dig> and xlp <dig> showed very similar kd values, consistent with the high conservation of contact residues. p <dig> and p <dig> form tighter tetramers than human p <dig>  which, at least in the case of p <dig>  can be attributed to extensive inter-dimer contacts made by the additional c-terminal helix . drp <dig>  which, phylogenetically, can be placed somewhere between mammalian p <dig> and the p63/p <dig> paralogs  <cit> , also forms more stable tetramers. what is most surprising is that dmp <dig> forms tetramers with a comparable kd, while having a completely different dimer-dimer interface, suggesting that, despite structural divergence, the strength of the tetramer has been conserved through evolution.

interestingly, the primary-dimer interface is tighter in p <dig> than in p <dig>  and p <dig> . comparison of the hsp <dig> and drp <dig> sequences with p <dig> and p <dig> suggests that this difference in dimer stability may be attributed to the r337-d <dig> salt bridge that stabilizes the helix packing in the p <dig> primary dimer and large-to-small substitutions of hydrophobic residues in p <dig> and p <dig>  the salt bridge is highly conserved in p <dig> across different species, and its disruption by a germline mutation  has been linked with adrenocortical carcinomas in children and other cancer forms  <cit> . p <dig> and p <dig> lack this intermolecular salt bridge and have a threonine  and glutamine  instead of the arginine in p <dig>  as a result of the weakened dimer interface in p <dig> and p <dig>  the dimers formed by tetramer dissociation are more likely to dissociate directly into monomers. since key features of the primary dimer interface are highly conserved among different species for each paralog, it is likely that they exhibit dissociation equilibria similar to their human orthologs. the only exceptions are cavia porcellus and pteropus vampyrus, whose p <dig> lacks the paralog-specific salt bridge and may, therefore, also have weakened primary dimers. the observed differences in dissociation equilibria of the human paralogs may have important biological implications for interactions with regulatory proteins, such as members of the s <dig> family, which have been shown to differentially bind different oligomeric states of p <dig>  <cit> . taken together, our results show that the overall strength of oligomerisation was conserved during the evolution of members of the p <dig> family, while subtle differences in the equilibria may play a role in fine-tuning their biological activity.

dna-contact residues are highly conserved in vertebrates
the sequence identity of the dna-binding domain of p <dig> family members varies and is highest between p <dig> from closely related species, e.g. 86% identity between mouse and human proteins and ~60% between drp53/xlp <dig> and hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> makes direct sequence-specific contacts with bases in the major groove of dna via the side chains of k <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and r <dig>  contacts with the phosphate backbone are made by the side chains of s <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  and the backbone amides of k <dig> and a <dig>  <cit> . all dna-contact residues are conserved in the vertebrate proteins studied . upon binding to a dna half-site, two dbds form a self-complementary protein-protein interface, mediated by residues p <dig>  h <dig>  r <dig>  m <dig> and g <dig>  which are conserved in vertebrate p <dig>  <cit> . in human p <dig> and p <dig> , however, there are key substitutions in this region, indicating differences in the inter-dbd interactions. dmp <dig> shows only 24% sequence identity to human p <dig>  <cit> , with significant differences in the various dna-binding motifs. k <dig> in the flexible l <dig> loop of hsp <dig> binds to two purine bases in position  <dig> and  <dig> of the response element. the equivalent loop in dmp <dig> is shortened and more rigid, making it unlikely that the lysine  forms the same dna contacts as in hsp <dig>  in addition, the alanine  making sequence-specific hydrophobic contacts in hsp <dig>  <cit>  is replaced by a threonine in dmp <dig> . furthermore, the dna-backbone contact residue r <dig> in hsp <dig> is replaced by a lysine . the l <dig> loop, which docks to the dna minor groove via r <dig> in hsp <dig>  is also significantly different. it has a deletion and lacks the equivalent of r <dig>  which plays a key role in stabilizing this region in hsp <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the l2/l3-loop region that forms the self-complementary dbd-dbd interface also shows variations, similarly to p <dig> and p <dig>  taken together, it would be reasonable to expect that the dna-binding properties of dmp <dig> differ from those of hsp <dig> 

conservation of the p <dig> response element and dna-binding specificity
we quantified the dna-binding properties of several members of the p <dig> family and investigated their ability to recognise methylated dna. we found that the dna-binding specificity of both orthologs and paralogs of p <dig> was conserved. human and mouse p <dig> proteins showed almost identical specificity, consistent with their highest sequence conservation. it is also interesting to note that they exhibited the lowest absolute specificity, as reflected by the lowest bit score of the derived motif. evolutionarily more distant vertebrate p <dig> proteins  showed a very similar specificity profile but somewhat higher specificity. there seems to be a very interesting underlying correlation: the more complex the organism and the more complex the p <dig> pathway, the lower the absolute specificity. p <dig> and p <dig> showed slightly different dna-binding specificity compared with p <dig>  this difference may be the result of the different residues in p <dig> and p <dig> being responsible for the interaction between two dbds upon binding to a half-site motif. despite the low sequence similarity of dmp <dig> and human p <dig>  and their aforementioned differences in key dna-binding motifs, the dna-binding specificity of dmp <dig> is preserved and is similar to that of vertebrate p <dig> family members, in particular the more ancestral p <dig> and p <dig> proteins. the longest p <dig> isoform tested, Δnp63α, has a significantly reduced dna-binding specificity compared to other isoforms. it is possible that the additional post-sam domain present in this isoform is directly or indirectly involved in regulation of its sequence-specific binding.

using the affinity prediction, we identified all putative binding sites in the human genome for p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> proteins. despite quantitative differences in their dna-binding specificity, all transcription factors studied select overlapping sets of binding sites. we found many more putative binding sites than have been previously identified in genome-wide experiments for p53/p63/p <dig> proteins  <cit> . the vast majority  of experimentally identified p <dig> binding sites  <cit>  contains a site predicted using our affinity data. the published dataset for p <dig>  <cit>  consists of  <dig> sites, which is significantly more than the  <dig> sites reported for p <dig>  less than 20% of these  <dig> sites contain a predicted high-affinity p <dig> site within a  <dig> bp window, perhaps reflecting different stringency criteria in peak calling in these two studies. despite these differences, analysis of all in vivo binding-site sequences in these studies generated positional weight matrices, represented as sequence logos, which are very similar to the sequence logos derived by us based on in vitro binding affinity. this strongly suggests that the driving force for localisation of p53/p63/p <dig> to their respective sites in the genome is their sequence-specific binding. a recent study using a novel microsphere assay showed that the dna-binding specificity of endogenous p <dig> in cell lysate is the same as that of the purified recombinant p <dig> from our work  <cit> . nevertheless, several validated p <dig> response elements contain non-canonical sequences  <cit> . it was shown, that p <dig> acts weakly to moderately on response elements that contain only a half or a three quarter site of the canonical consensus sequence  <cit> . this is in accordance with our results, as we observed considerable binding to dna with a mutated quarter or half site, which de facto represents a non-canonical p <dig> response element. binding to non-canonical response elements may be facilitated by co-activating transcription factors. a comprehensive comparison between in vivo and in vitro binding can be found in an excellent recent review  <cit> .

how can transcription factors with virtually identical dna-binding specificity elicit different biological responses? there is also the closely related question of how transcription factors select their binding site in the genome, among many potential sites of comparable affinity? the "chromatin structure" and "dna accessibility" concepts may at least partially answer the second question, although the mechanism controlling the chromatin structure with the specificity required is presently unknown. different expression patterns of transcription factors and/or their abundance in the nucleus can also contribute to their specificity. the involvement of additional specificity factors would answer both questions. such additional specificity factors should also bind dna in a sequence-specific manner, and are likely to be transcription factors.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data show that tetramerisation of p <dig> family members, which is important for high-affinity dna binding, was established very early in the evolution of the p <dig> family and has been functionally conserved ever since. despite significant differences in the contact surfaces involved, the strength of oligomerisation was preserved. intriguingly, the dna-binding specificity of different p <dig> family members is highly conserved even for evolutionarily distant species. this suggests that original functions were preserved while new functions were acquired during evolution, utilising the same dna-binding specificity. the "core function" dna-binding specificity of the p <dig> transcription factor network did not substantially change during evolution. instead, there is accumulating evidence that functional divergence of the p <dig> family evolved through changes in the connectivity within the network, for example by interactions of p <dig> family members with different sets of co-activating transcription factors.
