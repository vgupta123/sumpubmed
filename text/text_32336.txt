BACKGROUND
horned beetles, in particular in the genus onthophagus, are important models for studies on sexual selection  <cit> , biological radiations  <cit> , endocrine regulation of development  <cit> , biological control of invasive species  <cit> , conservation biology  <cit> , and forensic biology  <cit> . onthophagus beetles have more recently gained particular prominence as models for studying the origin and diversification of novel traits  and the developmental underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity .

despite their growing prominence as models for studying both basic and applied questions in biology, no genome projects exist for any onthophagus species. instead, investigations into the genetic basis of onthophagus biology have had to rely on homology-based gene-by-gene cloning  <cit>  and only very recently on low throughput est sequencing  <cit> . at the same time, development of genomic resources in several other insect models, such as drosophila, mosquitoes, tribolium beetles  <cit> , honey bees  <cit> , and several lepidopteran species  <cit> , has greatly advanced insights into the molecular and developmental genetics, physiology, and evolution of these organisms. onthophagus beetles offer great opportunities to add to the study of important biological phenomena pioneered through the study of these earlier models, such as the regulation of arthropod development, which has been informed in large part through work on fruit flies and tribolium beetles  <cit> , the origin of novel complex traits, as studied in butterfly wing patterns  <cit> , or the genetic regulation of nutrition-sensitive development, a central focus of honey bee research  <cit> .

furthermore, several other experimental techniques and tools have been successfully developed for onthophagus, most notably rnainterference mediated transcript depletion  <cit> . applying such tools to the study of onthophagus biology has, however, been hampered by the paucity of candidate genes and pathways available for investigation. the very recent development of modest est resources for onthophagus taurus using traditional sanger sequencing  <cit>  has already facilitated several important new research efforts  <cit> . combined, this suggests that studies on onthophagus beetles are poised to make rapid progress once large-scale genomic or transcriptomic resources are available, which in turn promises to advance our understanding of fundamental and applied question in evolution and developmental biology. here we describe an est collection developed for the horned beetle onthophagus taurus, the most commonly studied species of horned beetle to date.

RESULTS
sequencing, assembly and analysis of non-redundant sequences
we wished to sample a broad diversity of transcribed sequences including those expressed during the elaboration of horns. given that in drosophila melanogaster, which shares holometabolous development with beetles, the greatest number of genes are expressed in adult females, followed by pupal and then larval stages  <cit> , we anticipated that sampling transcription from post-embryonic stages of onthophagus would allow us to obtain a broad diversity of expressed sequences. we prepared sequencing libraries using rna isolated from all post-embryonic life stages including both sexes . sequencing using the  <dig> gs flx titanium platform yielded  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads. after cleaning,  <dig> , <dig> reads  were assembled using newbler  <cit>  and mira  <cit> , resulting in  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons  . thus, the approximately  <dig>  million reads collapsed into  <dig>  "non-redundant" sequences totaling  <dig> , <dig> nt. the sequence reads are available at ncbi sequence read archive  and the assembled sequences are provided in additional file  <dig> 

we characterized the non-redundant sequences in terms of similarity to known repeated sequences, known protein-coding sequences, and known transcribed sequences. first, running repeatmasker  <cit>  with repbase database for drosophila  <cit>  identified  <dig> lines,  <dig> ltr elements,  <dig> dna transposons and  <dig> small rnas . in total,  <dig> % of base pairs were masked including  <dig> kbp of simple repeats and  <dig> kbp of low complexity regions. second, aligning the onthophagus non-redundant sequences with the ncbi non-redundant  protein sequence database  <cit> , revealed that 54%  of the contigs had sequence matches with known proteins with an e-value <  <dig> × 10- <dig>  37%  had matches with an e-value <  <dig> × 10- <dig>  and 21%  had matches with an e-value <  <dig> × 10- <dig> . given that, on average, singletons were shorter than contigs, both in terms of overall length and the length of predicted open reading frames , it was to be expected that they would be less likely to include coding sequence. indeed, 25% , 12%  and 3%  of singletons had matches with e-values of <  <dig> × 10- <dig>  < <dig> × 10- <dig>  and < <dig> × 10- <dig>  respectively. while the singletons had proportionately fewer protein matches, they do contribute significantly to the information content of the non-redundant sequences. for instance, approximately 14% of the nr protein sequences with matches  against the non-redundant sequences matched exclusively with singletons. third, we aligned the non-redundant sequences against databases of sequences from t. castaneum, the only other beetle for which comprehensive sequence data is available. this revealed that a small proportion of the non-redundant sequences that do not have matches against nr do have matches against the t. castaneum genome or annotated proteins . approximately 4%  of the contig sequences, and 3%  of the singletons are in this category .

the total numbers of onthophagus sequences with matches against public databases at the indicated e-value cut-off. databases: ncbi nr  <cit> , tribolium unigene  <cit> , and tribolium proteins  <cit> . "query" denotes the total number of onthophagus sequences with matches against sequences from the database at the indicated cut-off. "subject" denotes the total number of sequences from the indicated database with matches against onthophagus sequences at the indicated e-value cut-off.

further analyses of these sequences revealed the following:   <dig> sequences matched the t. castaneum annotated protein coding sequences and genome.   <dig> sequences matched the t. castaneum annotated proteins but not the t. castaneum genome, and thus are likely to be genuine transcribed sequences, but the homologous sequences may not be included in the assembled t. castaneum genome.  of  <dig> sequences that matched only the t. castaneum genome,  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons matched t. castaneum sequences that lie within the bounds of annotated genes, but are not annotated as transcribed sequences. these may represent sequences that are included in mature transcripts in o. taurus but not t. castaneum. alternatively, they may identify sequences that are included in mature transcripts in t. castaneum but not annotated as such.   <dig> sequences matched unannotated genomic sequence in t. castaneum, and thus may identify lineage specific genes, or more likely, genes that are not annotated in t. castaneum. in total then, 52%  of the o. taurus non-redundant sequences matched either nr, or t. castaneum genomic or protein sequences. conversely, the o. taurus non-redundant sequences match with approximately 56%  of the gene models in t. castaneum, and 59%  of the sequence clusters in the tribolium unigene set . these data suggests we have sampled a significant fraction of the o. taurus transcriptome.

although we took measures to minimize gut contamination , the animals used to construct the library had to be cultured in cow dung, which is rich in plant and microbial material. we consequently anticipated that our est might include some non-onthophagus sequences, and therefore explored the taxonomic distribution of sequences matching the onthophagus non-redundant sequences. we did this using megan  <cit> , which assigns each sequence to the lowest common ancestor of the set of taxa with corresponding sequence matches. this analysis revealed that, of the sequences that had sequence matches and were assigned, the majority were assigned to the expected taxonomic groups within the arthropoda . specifically,  <dig>  contigs and  <dig> singletons, were classified to tribolium:  <dig>  to tenebrionidae,  <dig>  to polyphaga,  <dig>  to endopterygota,  <dig>  to neoptera,  <dig>  to arthropoda,  <dig>  to coelomata,  <dig>  to bilateria,  <dig>  to metazoa, and  <dig>  to eukaryota. reassuringly, a relatively small proportion was assigned to taxa outside beetles. for instance only  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons were classified to bacteria . this indicates that o. taurus sequences are not significantly contaminated by ests from bacteria or plants.

nevertheless, 48% of the o. taurus non-redundant sequences did not match with the t. castaneum genome or proteins. of  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>  sequences had significant hits  to the tribolium genome, tribolium proteins, and/or ncbi nr , while  <dig>  sequences had no significant match to any of these databases. we performed additional analyses on the "no-hit" sequences to determine whether they represent poor sampling  or biologically interesting  genes. compared to sequences with significant hits, the no-hit sequences had shorter contig lengths : hit =  <dig>  ; no hit =  <dig>  ; f <dig> =  <dig>  p = 0), smaller proportions of read length made up of predicted coding sequence : hit =  <dig>  ; no hit =  <dig>  ; f <dig> =  <dig> , p = 0), and fewer reads : hit =  <dig>  ; no hit =  <dig>  ; f <dig> =  <dig> , p = 0). while the mean distribution of contig length, proportion of coding sequence and read number was significantly different between hit and no hit sequences, there was considerable overlap between the two distributions . in particular, 21% of the no hit sequences  had at least the average read length  and proportion coding sequence  of sequences with hits. this subset of high quality sequences had on average  <dig> reads, suggesting they were not simply genes with low expression. taken together, this analysis suggests that while many of our "no hit" sequences likely represent low information content of a contig due to short or few reads, a significant proportion of these no hit sequences may represent highly divergent or novel genes that may prove interesting in future study.

in summary, the o. taurus non-redundant sequences match with over half of the genes in t. castaneum. if we assume that these two beetle species have similar total gene numbers, then we can infer that we have sampled a significant proportion of genes in o. taurus. there is no evidence that the o. taurus sequences are significantly contaminated with sequences from other taxa. furthermore, we seem to have sampled many genes that may represent highly divergent or novel proteins.

clustering related sequences
it was to be expected that many of the non-redundant sequences would derive from non-overlapping regions of common transcripts. indeed the  <dig>  non-redundant onthophagus sequences match a total of  <dig>  distinct sequences in the ncbi nr protein database . we took two approaches to identify clusters of non-redundant sequences that potentially derive from common transcription units.

the first approach to clustering the non-redundant sequences was based on an analysis of "broken reads", or individual sequence reads that were placed in two or more contigs during the assembly of contigs. pairs of contigs may be linked by broken reads if they  derive from the same gene but fail to assemble due to sequence polymorphisms between alleles,  derive from alternatively spliced transcripts,  derive from recently duplicated genes that still include some sequence similarity, or  if the read come from chimeric clones. in order to identify groups of contigs that are linked by broken reads we created a graph in which contigs are represented as nodes and broken reads represented as edges connecting nodes. this identified  <dig>  connected components , including  <dig>  bi-connected components . the bccs identify groups of three or more contigs that are linked by independent broken sequence reads. figure 3a shows an example of a simple bcc composed of three contigs that share three independent sets of broken reads. the likelihood of bccs resulting from chimeric clones is extremely low, as the minimum bcc of three nodes, would require three chimeras linking the three genes to occur independently. we reasoned that contigs with bccs arising from different genomic origins would share different levels of sequence similarity - contigs from divergent alleles would have higher sequence similarity than contigs derived from duplicated genes, and contigs derived from alternatively spliced exons may share no sequence similarity at all. we therefore performed inter se blastn sequence alignments of the contigs within each bcc, and categorized the bccs as follows. first, pairs of contig sequences that had at least  <dig> bp of at least 95% sequence identity, flanked on either side by no more than  <dig> nt of less than 95% sequence identity , were flagged as putative alleles and merged. second, pairs of contigs that failed to meet the criteria for allelic variants and had blastn matches of e-value <  <dig> × 10- <dig> were flagged as putative duplicates. third, pairs of contigs that failed to meet the criteria for allelic variants, and did not have blastn matches of e-value <  <dig> × 10- <dig> were flagged as putatively derived from alternative splicing. an analysis of known duplicated and alternatively spliced genes in drosophila suggests that the use of this method cannot fully exclude misclassification, but that the frequency of false calls should overall be low . therefore while the bccs provide strong evidence that contigs are related, the classification based on sequence similarity is only suggestive.

a total of  <dig>  contigs met the first set of criteria and were flagged as putative alleles and merged into  <dig>  groups. the hypothesis that these contigs derive from the same gene was supported by sequence matches against nr proteins. of the pairs of merged contigs where both contigs had sequence matches against nr, 99%  had best matches to the same protein sequence, and only 1%  matched different proteins.

a total of  <dig> pairs of contigs met the second set of criteria and were flagged as presumptive duplicates. the hypothesis that these contigs derive from duplicate genes was supported by sequence matches against nr proteins. of the pairs of contigs where both contigs have sequence matches against nr, 96%  had best matches to the same nr protein, and only 4%  had best matches to different proteins. we also asked whether there is evidence that the genes corresponding to the nr proteins are likely to be duplicated in the genomes of related species. of the sequences tested 85% had two matches  in t. castaneum  and 83% had two matches in a d. melanogaster . this indicates that 83-85% of the bccs flagged as putatively duplicated in onthophagus are also duplicated in other arthropods providing support for this classification.

we identified  <dig> groups of contigs  that met the third set of criteria and were thus flagged as putatively derived from alternative splicing. the hypothesis that these bccs derive from alternatively spliced transcripts was supported by sequence matches against nr proteins, and drosophila genes. of these bccs in which all contigs had sequence matches against nr, 62%  were composed of contigs that all had best matches with the same nr protein. we also investigated whether the corresponding genes  in d. melanogaster are annotated as being alternatively spliced. 67% of the  <dig> cases tested were annotated as alternatively spliced in d. melanogaster. these data support the prediction that the corresponding genes are indeed alternatively spliced in o. taurus. a simple example is illustrated in figure  <dig>  contigs  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  form a bcc that is joined by a total of  <dig> broken reads . each edge of the bcc is defined by multiple broken reads, with the minimum being eight. the three contigs do not share significant sequence similarity among themselves , and as such, were flagged in our analysis as putatively belonging to a common transcription unit with alternative splicing. indeed, the three conceptual polypeptide sequences from these contigs align to a contiguous region of the disabled protein from t. castaneum, supporting this hypothesis. it should be noted that many of the bccs that putatively result from alternative splicing have complex structures the resolution of which will require sequencing genomic and/or cdna sequences. in summary, the analysis of bccs grouped  <dig>  of the non-redundant sequences into  <dig>  groups flagged as putatively derived from a common gene . while the bcc analysis provides reasonably strong evidence for merging sequences, it clearly does not capture all likely cases, and we therefore turned to similarity to known genes as a more comprehensive means of grouping non-redundant sequences, as described next.

in the second approach to clustering onthophagus sequences we used similarity to sequences in the homologene database  <cit> , which is composed of groups of homologous gene sequences from  <dig> sequenced eukaryotic genomes. onthophagus sequences that match the same homologene sequence are likely to either derive from a single gene, or closely related gene family, in the onthophagus genome. a total of  <dig>  non-redundant onthophagus sequences  matched sequences from a total of  <dig>  homologene groups with an e-value <  <dig> × 10- <dig> . at this stringency, 55%  of the clusters are composed of two or more onthophagus sequences  and the remaining 45%  are composed of individual onthophagus sequences . restricting the clustering only to cases where all of the onthophagus sequences within a cluster have the best hit to the same homologene sequence  reduced the total number of clusters from  <dig>  clusters  to  <dig>  clusters  . there are  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons assigned uniquely to  <dig>  homologene groups. the number of clusters falls to  <dig>  at e-value <  <dig> × 10- <dig>  and then to  <dig>  at e-value <  <dig> × 10- <dig>  the major clusters represent the highest confidence set of non-redundant and presumably protein coding sequences. thus, the  <dig>  million reads collapse into  <dig>  non-redundant sequences, which in turn are clustered into  <dig>  major clusters with matches  against homologene. this clustering provides an estimate of the total number of transcribed protein coding genes identified in this study. this estimate is concordant with the total number of genes matched in the annotated tribolium genome  at the same e-value cut-off .

the total numbers of non-redundant onthophagus sequences with matches against the homologene  <cit>  database at the indicated e-value cut-offs. "query" denotes the total number of onthophagus sequences with matches against homologene sequences, and "subject" denotes the total number of sequences from the homologene database with matches against onthophagus. the numbers of cases where the all onthophagus sequences in a cluster have the best match to the same homologene sequence are shown in parenthesis.

functional annotation
we used sequence matches against the ncbi nr protein databases as a means of providing a first-pass annotation of putative function of the o. taurus non-redundant sequences. as expected the non-redundant sequences matched genes with a wide range of biological and biochemical processes . given that many of the non-redundant sequences derive from common genes, we turned to annotating the clustered sequences in order to gain a more accurate view of the range of biological processes represented by the expressed sequences. we examined the go term annotations associated with the  <dig>  homologene groups that match the major clusters. those clusters based on the best matches, i.e., major clusters, were searched for go terms and the number of homologene ids was counted for each go term. we used the annotated t. castaneum proteins as a reference for comparison. the distributions of the second and third level go term annotations of the sampled o. taurus sequences were remarkably similar to those on the complete t. castaneum proteome . this indicates that the o. taurus sequences represent a broad sampling of biological processes. this interpretation was supported by examining the representation of annotated biochemical pathways. we mapped the major clusters to ec  numbers and examined the distribution of these enzyme catalyzed reactions in a global metabolic map using ipath  <cit> . this revealed that the o. taurus expressed sequences included sequences encoding enzymes in all of the major categories of metabolic pathways including carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and amino acid metabolism . many of the core metabolic processes were well represented. for instance all of the steps in the tca cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid biosynthesis were found to be present. thus the onthophagus expressed sequences provide a good representation of genes with basic metabolic functions.

in addition to developing general comprehensive est resources for the future study or horned beetle biology, our study also aimed to enrich existing pools of putative candidate genes specifically for the study of horn formation and plasticity in horned beetle development. we therefore examined whether our est library contained contigs or singletons with matches to genes with go terms believed to be relevant to horn formation or developmental plasticity . for example, beetle horns develop from appendage anlagen that share many developmental properties with drosophila imaginal discs  <cit> , and we therefore searched for contigs matching genes with go terms related to imaginal disc development and patterning. this effort yielded a rich set of candidate genes including prominent leg gap genes  and several members of the notch, wnt, and smoothened signaling pathways. in addition to the likely importance of appendage patterning processes in horn development, horn formation is commonly sexually dimorphic  <cit> , which is thought to be regulated by sex-specific differences in the endocrine regulation of horn induction and proliferation  <cit> . it was therefore of interest to us to search our est library for contigs that match genes with go terms related to sex determination as well as ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone  metabolism and signaling. we identified several contigs that match cardinal sex determination and differentiation genes , or have been implicated in jh or ecdysteroid function . lastly, onthophagus development is characterized by a highly variable degree of developmental plasticity in response to nutritional variation and we therefore examined our est library for genes with go terms related to the regulation of nutrition-mediated plasticity. specifically, we searched our est list for contigs that match genes related to dna methylation  and insulin-signaling . this effort identified the complete set of all three dna methyltransferases  also reported from honey bees  <cit>  as well as several prominent members of the insulin receptor signaling pathway . these and additional examples are listed in table  <dig>  these results indicate that we greatly enriched the existing pools of candidate genes available for the study of horn formation and plasticity in horned beetle development.

examples of contigs representing genes putatively involved in onthophagus development. contig/singleton id, accession number from ncbi nr dataset, e-value, and gene description are shown. specific go terms shown here are:  <dig>  cell fate determination,  <dig>  epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway,  <dig>  dna methylation,  <dig>  leg disc pattern formation,  <dig>  instar larval or pupal development,  <dig>  insulin receptor signaling pathway,  <dig>  juvenile hormone metabolic process,  <dig>  positive regulation of programmed cell death,  <dig>  programmed cell death,  <dig>  regulation of notch signaling pathway,  <dig>  notch signaling pathway,  <dig>  regulation of gene expression, epigenetic,  <dig>  regulation of smoothened signaling pathway,  <dig>  smoothened signaling pathway,  <dig>  regulation of wnt receptor signaling pathway,  <dig>  wnt receptor signaling pathway,  <dig>  steroid hormone receptor activity,  <dig>  segment specification,  <dig>  sex differentiation,  <dig>  sex determination,  <dig>  wing disc pattern formation,  <dig>  response to ecdysone.

sequence polymorphisms
our libraries sampled a total of  <dig> haploid genomes  from a laboratory culture established from wild caught animals, which allowed us to begin to explore sequence variation in o. taurus. after merging contigs in bccs, all contigs were used for sequence variant analysis. gigabayes  <cit>  identified  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels. after removing indel calls in homopolymer regions,  <dig>  indels remained. additional file  <dig> shows histograms of our confidence in identified sequence variants . we focused subsequent analyses on only high quality sequence variants: those with at least  <dig> reads and a gigabayes probability value of at least  <dig> . additional file  <dig> shows sequence changes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  final snps and indels. transitions - a-g and t-c mutations - were more common than transversions. furthermore, insertions and deletions more commonly affected a and t than c and g.

across all contigs, the average snp frequency was  <dig>  snp/bp, or approximately  <dig> snp for every  <dig> base pairs . the number of snps in a contig was positively related to both contig length and number of reads in a standard least squares linear model containing both transformed variables . the number of insertions and deletions in a contig was also related to contig length and read number in a separate model . in subsequent analyses, we considered residual snp and indel frequency , which allowed us to estimate genetic variation while correcting for variation among contigs in read depth and length.

both contig length  and number of reads  were related to total detected snps and total detected indels in standard least squares linear models. residuals from these models were used in subsequent analyses to estimate levels of genetic variation in a contig controlling for sampling differences between contigs.

we aligned residual snp and indel frequency with a previously reported expression data set  <cit> . expression patterns were measured in females, large horned males and small sneaker males in three epidermal tissues  relative to abdominal epidermis and in central brain tissue, relative to ganglionic brain tissue. these array data  were used to estimate overall expression levels of a contig , total tissues in which differential expression was detected, bias between male morphs and sexes . we found that snp and indel frequency were negatively related to the overall expression level of a gene and the number of tissues  in which the gene was expressed, in a standard least squares linear model that also controlled for morph-biased and sex-biased expression .

shown are results from standard least square linear models relating measures of gene expression from a previous experiment - average expression levels , sex-biased gene expression, alternate mating morph-biased gene expression, and expression detected across up to four different tissue types - to estimates of genetic variation .

we used blast2go to identify go terms enriched in subsets of genes with more or less variation than expected. the most variable genes  were enriched for three go terms, including actin binding and cytoskeletal protein binding . the least variable genes  were enriched for  <dig> go terms, including many processes related to metabolism, development, intracellular functions, cell cycle, nucleic acid binding, anatomical structures, and life history .

discussion
our results build on a growing literature that shows that  <dig> pyrosequencing can be a powerful tool for expanding genomic resources for emerging model systems . this has vastly expanded our existing set of onthopagus ests that was previously generated by sanger sequencing  <cit> , with 93% of the  <dig> sequences  failing to match the sanger sequences . nevertheless the sanger ests are not entirely redundant, as  <dig> % of the sanger sequences failed to match the  <dig> sequences . using a series of analyses, these reads were assembled into contigs and clusters that represent approximately  <dig>  known genes . our analyses provide several lines of evidence that suggest we can be confident in our assembly.

first, the majority of our sequences significantly align with known protein sequences, in particular those of tribolium, the only beetle genome currently sequenced. specifically, 52% of contigs and singletons, and 59% of contigs align with known sequences from one of three databases . the majority of these alignments  agree between all three databases queried . a small number of genes  matched a protein in only one of the databases; these genes likely represent instances where the tribolium genome is incompletely annotated or assembled or where genes are transcribed in onthophagus, but not in tribolium .

while the majority of our sequences aligned with known sequences, 41-48% of our sequences did not match known proteins or the tribolium genome. our analyses suggest that many of these sequences represent contigs with short or very few reads, or reads that cover non-coding sequence . however, at least 20% of these genes are of similar or greater quality  of sequences with significant alignments, and may include genes that are novel or highly divergent between o. taurus and tribolium. this is not surprising given that onthophagus and tribolium shared a common ancestor over  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . these divergent genes may be fruitful for future research given that they may represent novel genes, or genes under strong selection for new functions.

a second line of evidence that generates confidence in our results is a survey of the taxonomic distribution of best sequence matches. specifically, of contigs with significant matches to the ncbi nr database, over  <dig>   were classified to tribolium, and  <dig>   to arthropoda. a relatively small proportion was classified to taxa outside of insects. for instance, less than one percent of genes were classified to bacteria. given these beetles feed on dung and have a diverse associated gut flora  <cit> , the non-arthropod-classified sequences could represent gut contamination of symbionts or partially digested plant products. we sought to minimize such contamination by sampling only the head and thorax of individual beetles, but presumably, contaminants could be present in the foregut or structures specialized to house symbionts. the fact that non-arthropod classified sequences are dominated by singletons, while the arthropod-classified sequences are dominated by contigs , supports the interpretation of minor contamination by naturally associated plant parts and bacteria.

our gene ontology classification also lends significant support to our assembly of the onthophagus taurus transcriptome. comparing onthophagus to tribolium, our genes sample roughly the same proportion of gene classes for classifications of molecular function, cellular component, and biological process . for instance, in tribolium,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> percent of genes are involved in "biological regulation," "developmental process" and "establishment of localization," respectively, while in onthophagus, the corresponding percentages are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the largest differences are still modest and fall within the "metabolic process" category ; which could prove to be an interesting consequence of the differences in diet between the two species.

by comparing our assembled sequences to existing databases, our analyses suggest that we have sampled about half of the onthophagus transcriptome. for instance, around  <dig>  contigs and singletons match to approximately  <dig>  separate genes . based on the drosophila genome, we can estimate that onthophagus may possess around  <dig>  genes; thus, we have sampled about half of the genes present in the genome. if we assume that the  <dig>  higher quality, but highly diverged genes discussed above, which did not align to known genes, match to about  <dig>  additional, independent genes , then we may have sampled about 60% of the transcriptome. regardless, this dataset represents a rich resource for future work on the system.

bioinformatic approaches
next generation sequencing and the de novo assembly of transcribed sequences is increasingly being used to characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms for which a whole-genome sequence is not yet available  <cit> . the absence of a reference genome sequence makes the assembly of these sequences particularly challenging. because  <dig> sequencing results in sequence reads that are generally shorter than a given gene, assembly relies on generating a series of overlapping reads. however, any sequence variants among the reads, for instance due to genetic variation between individuals, sequencing of paralogs of a gene, or alternative splicing, can make assembly difficult. furthermore, overlapping reads may be assembled for separate components of a gene, resulting in multiple contigs representing one gene. we used several complementary bioinformatic approaches to overcome the limitations of short read lengths.

we used a clustering approach against the homologene database to determine whether our non-redundant sequences  derived from the same gene within the genome. similar approaches have been demonstrated to be effective in clustering contigs of transcribed sequences in the absence of a reference genome  <cit> . this method allowed us to identify the highest confidence set of non-redundant protein-coding sequences in our dataset. for instance, with an e value <  <dig> × 10- <dig>   <dig>  onthophagus sequences matched sequences from  <dig>  homologene groups . this method was concordant with our more general approach to identify the number of genes sampled, where we tested for sequence matches across several databases, including the tribolium genome .

in the absence of a reference genome sequence it is very difficult to identify sequences that derive from the same gene but fail to assemble due to sequence polymorphisms or alternative splicing. this is particularly true in the absence of informative similarities to sequences from related species. one approach to this problem has been to remove a sub-set of redundant contigs without resolving the relationship between the sequences  <cit> . here we used a novel analysis of "broken reads," individual sequence reads that were placed in two or more contigs during assembly. this approach identifies groups of sequences connected through multiple broken reads  and are thus biologically linked, but have failed to assemble due to sequence polymorphisms, alternative splicing or gene duplication . to our knowledge this approach is unique in being able to cluster such sequences in the absence of a reference genome. we then used sequence similarity amongst the sequences within bi-connected components to infer the most likely physical origin of the connected sequences. for instance, when linked contigs shared at least 95% sequence identity, they were assumed to be divergent alleles and the sequences were merged. of the sets of linked contigs that fit this criterion, 99%  matched to the same protein in the ncbi nr database, suggesting our assumptions were correct. linked contigs with less sequence similarity were classified as either putative duplicates  or alternatively spliced transcripts , both of which were supported by comparing our classifications to existing gene models. it is important to emphasize that while the clustering of bi-connected components provides very strong evidence that the sequences derive from either alleles, alternatively spliced transcripts, or gene families, the classification based on sequence similarity is not definitive. the definitive resolution of gene structures must ultimately rely on genome and/or full length cdna sequencing. despite this caveat the clustering based on broken reads is an effective means of grouping related sequences in the absence of a reference genome.

our preliminary snp analyses lend further confidence in the classification of genes as alternative alleles. first, we found that transitions were more common than transversions , as commonly reported in studies that consider patterns of genetic variation  <cit> . second, we used previously reported microarray data  <cit>  to test whether the snps we identified were related to patterns of gene expression in manners consistent with other studies. we found significant negative relationships between snp frequency and overall levels of gene expression, consistent with the commonly reported relationship between gene expression and gene conservation  <cit> . we also found a negative relationship between snp frequency and the number tissues in which a gene was significantly expressed, which is reminiscent of the positive relationship between tissue-specific gene expression and sequence divergence due to pleiotropic constraints  <cit> .

overall, our use of multiple, complementary bioinformatic approaches allowed us to glean a large amount of information from one  <dig> run. we are now primed for a range of studies on the onthophagus system, some of which we highlight below. furthermore, this analysis pipeline will allow similar resources to be developed for a range of emerging model systems.

tools for future studies of this model system
the resources generated in the present study provide an expansive toolbox for advancing current, and enabling future research efforts in horned beetles. here, we highlight three particularly interesting avenues for future inquiry.

the origin of a novel trait: horn development
horned beetles in general, and onthophagus beetles in particular, are becoming attractive models for studying the origin and diversification of novel traits, specifically horns  <cit> . horns lack obvious homology to other traits in insects or non-insect arthropods, yet develop at least in part similar to more traditional appendages such as legs and mouthparts. thus, beetle horns offer an interesting opportunity to study how evolutionary changes in the interactions between ancestral developmental-genetic mechanisms may enable the origin of novel features. earlier studies have begun to implicate several developmental pathways in the regulation of horn development using immunohistochemical analysis of candidate genes , quantitative pcr , hormone manipulations  and most recently rnainterference  <cit> . in each case, analysis of candidate genes was limited to very few or one gene candidate. in the present study we substantially increase the number of candidate genes now available to investigate the role of these pathways in horn development and evolution . furthermore, we provide a substantial number of candidate genes for the investigation of developmental pathways previously inaccessible for study, yet hypothesized to play a potentially significant role in the origin and diversification of beetle horns and horned beetles, such as the notch, wnt, and egfr signaling pathways  <cit> . in so doing the present study also contributes important resources for moving beyond the examination of single candidate genes and toward examining interactions between developmental pathways and within and between gene networks.

phenotypic plasticity
the biology of horned beetles is characterized by a remarkable degree of phenotypic plasticity - a single genotype's ability to adjust phenotype expression to changes in environmental conditions <cit> . in horned beetles, such plastic responses involve behavioral traits , parental investment  <cit> , physiological changes  and morphology . however, the developmental genetic basis of this plasticity is largely unknown. here, our  <dig> run has generated a rich set of tools for future inquiry into the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity. for instance, the insulin signaling pathway has been suggested to play an important role in mediating the plastic switch between fighter and sneaker tactics in horned beetles  <cit> . our sequencing effort identified many important genes in this pathway, including chico, foxo, insulin receptor, and melted.

similarly, dna methylation is another important candidate pathway for nutrition-induced phenotypic plasticity  <cit> . the importance of dna methylation in insects has been of interest in recent years, following the discovery that a complete methylation machinery - while absent in drosophila - is present in the hymenoptera  <cit> , shows significant variation across species  <cit> , and appears to play an important role in nutrition-induced caste determination in honeybees  <cit> . the present study has identified the complete set of all three dna methyltransferases  in onthophagus taurus, including the de novo methyltransferase  and the maintenance methyltransferase , setting the stage for future studies into the role of dna methylation in horned beetle plasticity

population genetics and patterns of genetic variation
our snp analyses identified overall levels of genetic variation comparable to  <dig> studies of other animals sampled from wild populations  <cit> , but considerably more relative to domestic or lab strains of animals  <cit>  and considerably less relative to plants, even domestic varieties  <cit> . this snp dataset will serve as a powerful resource in future studies of genetic variation. we can now easily genotype individuals and sample standing levels of genetic variation. having snps associated with this assembly also primes us for more powerful analyses of how gene expression patterns affect genetic variation, for instance due to relaxed selection on morph- or environment-specific genes  <cit> .

our snp dataset also brings us closer to identify patterns of natural selection on the onthophagus genome, and determining which genes are under strong positive or purifying selection. such analyses will be facilitated by sequencing other species in the genus . until then, we can get hints at classes of genes under strong or weakened selection, based on our gene ontology enrichment analysis of more or less variable genes. for instance, very few go categories were associated with highly variable genes . this could be because these variable genes are more divergent and have no or incomplete annotation. indeed, of these  <dig> genes ,  <dig> % were annotated in the low variation group and  <dig> % were annotated in the high variation group. in contrast, the least variable genes were enriched for over  <dig> go terms . scanning this list reveals many processes that are likely under purifying or positive selection, including metabolism , development , cell cycle , morphology , and life history . while these processes may be biologically relevant and possibly indicative of the origin and rapid diversification of novel traits in this lineage , it is important to treat these lists with caution as such enrichment analyses can be confounded by nested gene ontology categories  <cit> . regardless, this analysis yields genes and developmental processes that may prove interesting for future study in this system.

CONCLUSIONS
this study sampled sequences from approximately half of genes expressed in the horned beetle onthophagus taurus. this greatly advances our knowledge of the onthophagus transcriptome and paves the way for future molecular genetic studies of horn evolution and development.
