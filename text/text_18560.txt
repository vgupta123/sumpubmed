BACKGROUND
transposable elements  not only make up big part of genomes of higher plants, but also play an important role in promoting their genomic diversity  <cit> . helitrons, a new category of dna tes, have recently been uncovered by the computational analysis of genomic sequences of a. thaliana, o. sativa and c. elegans  <cit> . lacking the typical structures that are characteristic of traditional class dna tes, helitrons are difficult to be identified. however, helitrons have a "tc" motif on the 5'-terminus and a "ctrr" motif on the 3'-terminus; they also contain a 16- <dig> bp palindromic sequence, which can form a hairpin structure of 10- <dig> bp upstream of the 3'-terminus. in addition, they insert preferentially between adenine and thymidine nucleotides  <cit> . helitrons are ubiquitous in all studied eukaryotes, such as a. thaliana, c. elegans, d. melanogaster, d. rerio, i. tricolor, l. perenne, m. lucifugus, a. gambiae, m. truncatula, n. vectensis, o. sativa, x. maculatus, s. bicolor, s. nephelus, and z. mays  <cit> .

helitrons constitute over 2% of the maize genome. it was estimated that there might be tens of thousands elements in maize inbred line b <dig>  <cit> . they could capture gene fragments and move around the genome, which leads to gene diversity between the maize inbred lines  <cit> . helitrons have contributed the remarkable variation of haplotype in the bz  genomic locus among different maize inbred lines  <cit> . two helitrons containing hundreds of copies in maize inbred line b <dig> have been identified  <cit> .

more helitrons and their capture gene fragments have been detected in maize than in a. thaliana and o. sativa  <cit> . yang et al.  <cit>  found that over half of the helitrons have contained gene fragments in the b <dig> genome. they could be from  <dig> bp to a  <dig>  kb gene fragments in length, and might even include an entire gene sequence  <cit> . according to the results of du et al.  <cit>  and yang et al.  <cit> , the helitrons could possess zero to nine gene fragments, which came from  <dig> and  <dig> different genes. the gene fragments carried by these elements could also form chimeric genes  <cit> . ests of helitron sequences have been detected in certain maize tissues  <cit> . it is possible that some functional genes can be produced from the shuffling of the capture gene fragments.

the mechanism how helitrons capture gene fragments and how they transpose remain unknown. the replication initiator  protein motif and a dna helicase  domain are considered to be the key protein features of rolling circle  processes in bacteria  <cit> . it was postulated that helitrons could mobilize by the rc replication of the "copy-and-paste" model in eukaryotes  <cit> . choi et al.  <cit>  found a predicted autonomous element carrying rep/hel-tpase and rpa-tpase in i. tricolor, however, it contained a frameshift and a non-sense mutation. morgante et al.  <cit>  identified two sequences that contained the conserved rc-rep motif and dna helicase domain in two maize inbred lines. however they both are interrupted by other transposons. du et al.  <cit>  and yang et al.  <cit>  proposed that helitrons had amplified within the last  <dig> million years and could still be active in the modern maize. so far, no intact autonomous element has been discovered in maize  <cit> .

the full genome sequence of inbred line b <dig> has been achieved using bac by bac sequencing strategy recently  <cit> . du et al.  <cit>  and yang et al.  <cit>  have developed methods for identifying helitrons, and mined  <dig>  and  <dig>  elements, respectively. they had analyzed the extensive distribution, variability and diversity of helitrons in the maize genome. from these studies, certain hallmarks of helitrons in maize have emerged, such as that they preferentially inserted near other ones, but less commonly inserted into certain gene. there were some elements with more than one 5'-termini or 3'-termini. many helitrons have been shown to carry phosphatase 2c-like gene fragments.

to further understand the characteristics of helitrons as well as the features of their transpositions, we have again developed a set of perl scripts to search for additional helitrons in the maize genome. a total of  <dig>  helitrons have been identified including three putative autonomous elements and two helitrons with high copy number. our study not only provides a detailed characterization of putative intact automomous helitrons, but also presents evidence to suggest that gene fragment capturing during the transposition of helitrons happened in a stepwise way, with multiple gene fragments within one helitron being the capturing the products of several sequential transpositions. we have also proposed and provided the evidence to support a mechanism regarding how multiple terminal elements are generated.

RESULTS
identification of additional helitrons
to obtain additional helitrons with high confidence, the sequences of  <dig> published ones  <cit>  including twenty helas and three helbs, were used as query sequences to search against the maize genome sequence by blastn. the resulting  <dig> candidate helitrons were initially identified. to further verify these candidate helitrons, two strategies were used. firstly, helitron locating in repeated regions could be verified by blastn   <cit> . secondly, helitrons with multiple copies of high similarity could be verified each other by aligning their sequences together to determine their exact 5' and 3' boundaries . altogether, we obtained  <dig> validated helitrons by these two methods, including eighty helas and sixteen helbs. to further confirm these helitrons, we conducted pcr experiments for some selected helitrons. all fourteen that had successful pcr amplification showed variable in sizes of pcr products , indicating the vacant sites and occupied sites, therefore providing final confirmation for our  <dig> seed helitrons.

based on the terminal sequence characteristics of the  <dig> validated helitrons, a perl script was designed to identify additional elements in the maize genome. as a result, a total of  <dig>  intact elements were obtained. according to a standard previously reported  <cit> , we divided these new elements into two different families, which including  <dig>  helas and  <dig> helbs . the size of these elements ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp; the average length was  <dig>  bp for hela, and  <dig>  bp for helb. overall,  <dig> %  of hela sequences were less than  <dig> kb in length. similarly  <dig> %  helb were less than  <dig> kb. helas with the length of over  <dig> kb  and all  <dig> helbs with the length of over  <dig> kb were classified as putative "autonomous" helitrons if they do not contain other long transposons such as retrotransposon.

helas had a conserved sequence of the  <dig> bp at the 5'-terminus and  <dig> bp at the 3'-terminus including palindromic structures. helbs had conservative sequences for  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp at the 5'-terminus and 3'-terminus, respectively . the 5'-terminus of helbs was significantly different from those of helas.

putative autonomous helitrons
in general, the helitrons that encode replication initiator  motif, dna helicase domain and a possible replication a protein  <dig> -like motif in plants, are considered as putative autonomous ones  <cit> . to find potential autonomous helitrons, all helas sequences of over  <dig> kb and helbs of over  <dig> kb were carefully annotated. two sequences, named zmhela <dig>  and zmhelb <dig>  respectively were qualified as putative autonomous elements. zmhela <dig> and zmhelb <dig> all contained conserved rep motif and dna helicase domain without frameshift . those conserved domains were reported to be essential for dna replication and for unwinding double stranded dna in other prokaryotic and eukaryotic species  <cit> . the putative autonomous zmhela <dig> also contained a putative rpa remnant before the rep motif , although the rpa sequence had a very low sequence homologous with that of a. thaliana and o. sativa  <cit> . in addition, zmhela <dig> also carried eight predicted gene fragments. zmhelb <dig> possessed three putative single strand dna-binding domains -a/-b/-c of rpa <dig> following the helicase domain in the orf , which were in the same orientation as the rep/helicase gene. zmhelb <dig> also carried two postulated gene fragments. based on these structural characteristics, autonomous helitrons in maize could be at least divided into two types, a result that was consistent with the neighbor-joining phylogeny analysis .

to obtain additional putative "autonomous" elements, the rpa-like and dna helicase of a. thaliana and o. sativa  <cit>  were used to search against maize genome by tblastn respectively. then the obtained sequences were extended  <dig> kb each in the 5'-terminus and 3'-terminus respectively. finally, the obtained putative autonomous helitrons were annotated by fgenesh . as a result, five putative autonomous helbs were identified by this homolog searching approach. one of the five putative autonomous helbs, zmhelb <dig>  with the length of  <dig>  bp, also encoded an intact orf as zmhelb <dig> with potentially functional rep motif, a dna helicase domain and a rpa <dig> motif without frameshift . these two putative autonomous helbs have similar structural characteristics as that reported by morgante et al.  <cit> .

helitrons of multiple terminal sequences and of high copy number
our result showed that  <dig> % of helas had contained multiple terminal structures. we called the internal terminal sequences as the pseudo terminus . through multiple sequence alignment, we found that the real 3'-terminus of helitrons contained highly conserved "ctag" motif, but not at the pseudo 3'-terminus of elements with multiple 3'-termini . one hundred helas with multiple 3'-termini were randomly sampled to analyze structure of their pseudo 3'-termini, the result showed that 99%  of the internal 3' end sequence had a pseudo 3'-terminus with no intact "ctag" motif. however, we did not find any multiple terminal sequences in the  <dig> helbs.

based on the sequence characteristics of pseudo 3'-termini that we obtained, the following consensus sequence model was defined: "ccgtgcacgcacg{2}{ <dig>  8}ctat". by searching against the maize genome sequence according to the model,  <dig> pseudo 3'-termini sequences were obtained. ten sequences were randomly selected from these newly identified pseudo 3'-termini, and the intact 3'-termini structures were shown within  <dig> kb downstream. it was ubiquitous that the pseudo 3'-termini we identified had no intact "ctag" motif in maize. using the same methods, we found that  <dig> % of helas also had multiple 5'-termini. however, there were no distinct differences between the pseudo 5'-terminal sequence and the true 5'-terminal one.

helitrons with many copies have been previously identified in inbred line b <dig>  <cit> . here we found two additional elements with high copy number. two of the helas, named helitron_mc <dig>  and helitron_mc <dig> , possessed  <dig> and  <dig> copies with a high stringent criteria , respectively. using a more relaxed set of criteria , there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies, respectively . helitron_mc <dig> had over 85% identities in  <dig>  bp of the 3'-end sequence with helitron_mc <dig>  it is possible that helitron_mc <dig> have evolved from helitron_mc <dig>  in addition, helitron_mc <dig> also possessed two pseudo 3'-termini structures .

gene fragments captured by helitrons
in order to analyze the gene fragments carried by helitrons, all detected elements were searched against the nonredundant protein  database using the blast program. most of helitrons with a size of less than  <dig> kb  did not contain any gene fragment. most of elements with lengths from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb  had only obtained one gene segment. the number of capture gene fragments by the helas ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with a mean value of  <dig>  most helas  carried between  <dig> and  <dig> gene fragments. all of the helbs held no more than five gene fragments, with an average of  <dig> . the majority of helbs  acquired  <dig> to  <dig> gene fragments .

a total of  <dig>  gene fragments were carried by the helas, which encoded  <dig>  proteins . there were  <dig> helas that had captured a near identical fragment of phosphatase  2c-like protein   <cit> , the same gene fragment found in helitron_mc <dig> and helitron_mc <dig>  different members of the phosphatase  2c family protein were also captured by other helas, such as acf <dig>  , aaq <dig>   and acf <dig>  . it is possible that the phosphatase  2c-like protein carried by the helas could have been amplified previously  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> gene fragments coming from  <dig> proteins have been captured by helbs . there were  <dig> helbs that contained a same gene fragment . our results suggest that helitrons do not have a bias in capturing gene fragments.

step by step capturing of gene fragment
many helitrons have captured several gene fragments. some of the gene fragments are apparently even from different chromosomes of the maize genome. how can a single helitron capture a number of gene fragments originally located in several different loci of the genome is a big puzzle thus far. extensive sequence alignment analyses showed that there was high level but fragmented sequence homology within their captured gene fragments among a number of newly identified helitrons. for example, several captured gene fragments of zmhela <dig>  were shown to have high sequence similarity with multiple captured fragments of zmhela <dig> , zmhela <dig> , helitron_mc <dig> and helitron_mc <dig>  respectively. all these four elements have near identical first  <dig> bp of their 5'-termini and last  <dig> bp of their 3'-termini. interestingly, zmhela <dig> and zmhela <dig> have over 95% identity from 5' to 3' end, excepting one insertion in the middle for zmhela <dig>  therefore, zmhela <dig> can be explained by having captured a  <dig>  bp gene fragment and having inserted into  <dig> bp of its 5'-termini of its ancestral element . in the same way, zmhela <dig> and helitron_mc <dig> showed high sequence similarity  with the  <dig> bp of the 3'-terminus of zmhela <dig>  detailed analysis indicated that, starting from an ancestral element that is missing only one internal gene fragment  from zmhela <dig>  the zmhela <dig> and helitron_mc <dig> can both be generated by capturing different gene fragments over several steps of transposition. our result strongly suggested that the gene fragments captured by helitrons happened in sequential fashion, with each step of transposition likely capturing one gene fragments. in fact, such a stepwise gene capturing capacity will provide endless opportunity to shuffle gene fragments originating from all over the genome.

zmhelb <dig>  might have evolved from zmhelb <dig>  zmhelb <dig> and zmhelb <dig> have the same terminal sequences, but the former lacked the dna helicase domain and the replication protein a -like fragments that were found in zmhelb <dig> . this indicated that helitrons could lose the internal sequence during the process of transposition in maize.

discussion
helitrons are particularly complex in the maize genome  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  elements were obtained based on the terminal sequence characteristics of elements in this research. du et al.  <cit>  and yang et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  intact elements in the maize genome, which overlapped  <dig> % and  <dig> % with our result respectively . the differences among these three searching programs are mainly due to the parameters used in the respective perl scripts. for example, the script used by du et al.  <cit>  only aimed to identify helas, while script used in this study is intended to cover both helas and helbs. additionally, du's script and that of the current study have also differed in a number of searching criteria which leaded to a number of specific helitrons being identified by each script. based on previous estimation  <cit> , there are still a large number of helitrons in maize b <dig> genome have not been identified. due to the unique structure of helitrons, it is still very difficult to unambiguously identify all these elements. with more seed helitrons available, a more accurate script could be generated which would drastically increase the number of elements being identified in the b <dig> genome.

putative autonomous helitrons
all helitrons that have been identified so far in the maize genome are nonautonomous  <cit> . in fact, truly autonomous elements have not been found in eukaryotic species to date. in a spontaneous pearly-s mutant of i. tricolor, choi et al.  <cit>  found that a putative autonomous helitron containing rep/hel-tpase and rpa-tpase, but it had a frameshift and a nonsense mutation. morgante et al.  <cit>  identified two sequences contained rep motif and dna helicase domain. however they both are interrupted by other transposons. three putative autonomous helitrons found in this research have contained intact rep motif and dna helicase domain, the same as those found in a. thaliana and o. sativa  <cit> . we also detected other four helbs with the conserved rep motif and the dna helicase domain, however, their orf were either having frameshift or incomplete . although we can not confirm that these three putative autonomous helitrons are actually function as autonomous element at present, the presence of these three putative autonomous sequences with intact orf in the b <dig> genome is strongly suggested that true autonomous helitrons could exist in modern maize.

zmhela <dig> had a putative rpa remnant before the rep motif. zmhelb <dig> and zmhelb <dig> possessed an intact rpa1-like domain following the helicase domain in the same orf respectively. choi et al.  <cit>  speculated that rep/helicase were ubiquitous in eukaryotes, and could play a more important role in the helitrons transposition than rpa <dig>  the structural characteristics of putative autonomous elements in a. thaliana, c. elegans, i. tricolor, m. lucifugus, o. sativa and z. mays were carefully analyzed  <cit>  . the putative autonomous elements in animal only contain the conserved rep motif and dna helicase domain. the putative autonomous elements in plants all contain rpa-dbd-a/-b/-c before rep motif or after helicase domain, except for the conserved rep motif and dna helicase domain. if zmhela <dig> indeed function as an autonomous element, then it would suggest that rpa <dig> is not an indispensable feature for helitrons transposition. the putative autonomous helitrons in plants can be divided into two types. one is rpa-dbd-a/-b/-c, following the successive rep motif and dna helicase domain in two different orf respectively. the second contains the rep motif, dna helicase domain and rpa-dbd-a/-b/-c in their appropriate order in the same orf.

generation of helitron with multiple termini from nested helitrons
most helitrons in the maize genome were found to be small sizes. about 80%  helas were between  <dig> bp and  <dig> kb in length, and  <dig> %  helbs ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb in this research. yang et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig>  elements, of which  <dig> %  were less than  <dig> kb in length. the finding of helitrons with multiple copies suggests that they do not always capture gene fragments in the process of transposition.

there were  <dig> % helas that possessed multiple terminal structures as shown by du et al.  <cit> . the pseudo 3'-termini sequences had damaged "ctag" motif comparing with the real 3'-termini. we found that the pseudo 3'-termini structures were ubiquitous in maize inbred line b <dig>  helas had preference to insert near to or inside other helitrons  <cit> , which could have caused to form multiple terminal sequences inside them. genomic evolution or transpositions could have caused an intact terminal structure to turn into a pseudo 3'-terminus . yang et al.  <cit>  reported that helitrons could recognize a new 3'- or 5'-terminus site to form a new element in a. thaliana. du et al.  <cit>  found that the 3'-termini sequences were more variable than the 5'-termini ones.

the evolutionary pathway of helitrons with shared capture gene fragments can be deduced according their different combination of their capture gene fragments . we detected two elements with multiple copies, helitron_mc <dig> and helitron_mc <dig>  the latter possessed two pseudo 3'-termini structures . there was a high similarity in the 5'-terminal sequence of helitron_mc <dig> and zmhela <dig> . helitron_mc <dig>  helitron_mc <dig> and zmhela <dig> had one, three and one fragment respectively, which are highly homologous to  <dig> bp of the 3'-terminus of zmhela <dig> . according to these observations, helitron_mc <dig> might have evolved from helitron_mc <dig> and zmhela <dig>  <cit> . the detail of the hypothesized evolution path for helitron_mc <dig> is shown in figure 4b, c, d. zmhela <dig> were inserted into helitron_hypo <dig> . then helitron_hypo <dig> carrying zmhela <dig> inserted into helitron_mc <dig> to form nested heltrons. eventually helitron_mc <dig> was generated by further transposition starting from the 5'-end of zmhela <dig> while including the rest of three 3' ends. the intact 3' end "ctag" motif can be mutated either before or after the generation of helitron_mc <dig>  as there exist a large number of nested retrotransposons  <cit> , there can be a lot of nested helitrons in the maize genome. the later is then served as intermediate to give rise to many helitrons of multiple termini seen in the b <dig> genome.

CONCLUSIONS
helitrons in the maize genome are variable size. when the elements transposed, they could sometimes capture gene fragments or lose their internal sequence. gene capturing of helitrons can happen in a stepwise mode through sequential transpositions. three putative autonomous helitrons were discovered in maize with intact replication initiator  motif and a dna helicase  domain, similar to those identified in other species. therefore, it is possible that active autonomous elements exist in modern maize. our study also indicated that helitrons with multiple termini can be generated from nested helitrons.
