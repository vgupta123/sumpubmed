BACKGROUND
viruses change the physiology and metabolism of infected plants, and can directly or indirectly influence the host’s gene expression patterns . high-throughput technologies such as expressed sequence tags , microarrays and next-generation sequencing, have made possible the simultaneous analysis of functional data for many genes and the study of the plant’s transcriptomic remodelling in response to virus infections  <cit> . in the past few years, dna microarrays have become popular tools for comparative high-throughput gene expression analysis, and microarray platforms have become available for both model and non-model crop species. melon , in addition to its agronomic importance, has biological features that make it an interesting experimental model, favouring the development of a growing number of genetic and molecular tools for this species, including large ests collections  <cit> , tilling platforms  <cit>  and the sequencing of its genome  <cit> . more specifically, est sequencing has allowed the development of a melon-specific microarray  <cit> , which has been used for transcriptomic profiling of cucumber mosaic virus , watermelon mosaic virus  and monosporacus cannonballus-infected plants . in this work, we have used the melon microarray to profile the melon transcriptome after infection with melon necrotic spot virus .

mnsv  is endemic in cucurbit crops worldwide, often causing significant economic losses due to epidemic outbreaks. the mnsv genome is composed of a  <dig> kb, single-stranded positive-sense rna containing at least five open reading frames   <cit>  which are flanked by two untranslated regions  at their 5′ and 3′ termini. the 3′ orf encodes the capsid protein  which has a structural role, is necessary for vascular transport of the virus, plays a role in suppression of rna silencing  <cit>  and is involved in virus transmission  <cit> . it also contains a double gene block , typical of carmoviruses, consisting of two small, centrally located orfs, which encode two consecutive 7 kda proteins  involved in the cell-to-cell movement of the virus  <cit> . the 5′ orf can either encode a 29 kda protein  ending in an amber codon, or a larger 89 kda gene product  if it is read-through, which contains the rna-dependent rna polymerase  domain. the p <dig> and p <dig> proteins are involved in viral replication  <cit> , which takes place in virus-altered mitochondria  <cit> . the 3′-utr of genomic mnsv rnas, which are identical to those of sub-genomic rnas, has been shown to contain sequences that act as cap-independent translational enhancers   <cit> . depending on the specific nature of these 3′-cites, mnsv can infect n. benthamiana and the otherwise resistant melon plants that carry the recessive eif4e228l allele at the nsv locus . interestingly, 3′-cites exhibit a modular nature, as they can be exchanged among viral strains or even viral species through recombination  <cit> .

in this work, we have used two mnsv strains that only differed in their 3-utrs, namely, mnsv-mα <dig> and a chimera with its 3′-utr from mnsv- <dig>  for infection profiling. mnsv- <dig> is a strain that is able to break the resistance controlled by nsv  <cit> . the characterization of melon cultivar-specific responses was also investigated, and two melon cultivars were used for this purpose. these were: cv. tendral, which is fully susceptible to mnsv, and cv. planters jumbo, which is homozygous for the recessive eif4e228l resistance allele and is therefore resistant to most mnsv isolates but not to those carrying the mnsv- <dig> 3′-cite  <cit> , as is the case for mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  <cit> . locally-infected tissues were analysed in a time-course experiment and the melon microarray  <cit>  was used for describing differential alterations of the melon transcriptome associated with:  the presence of one or another 3′-utr in the mnsv rna,  the melon genotype and  the type of plant tissue infected.

RESULTS
identification of the main sources of variability
once the data from each sample were normalized, biological variability and sample grouping were analyzed using principal component analysis  . biological replicates from infected tissues, either from cotyledons  or leaves , always grouped together. the first component of variance separated cotyledon samples by treatment  and the second one by time after infection . interestingly, tendral cotyledon or leaf samples inoculated with mnsv-mα <dig> separated from their healthy controls to a greater degree than the rest of the infected vs. healthy pairs ; in contrast, tendral leaf samples inoculated with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> separated to a lesser degree from their healthy controls than the other pairs . a hierarchical clustering analysis was also performed , and the results showed that once again, the cotyledon samples clustered primarily by treatment  and then by time after infection . among cotyledon samples, clustering varied for  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, with tendral samples infected with the two viral isolates becoming more distinct with time . in the case of the inoculated leaves, the differentiation between infected and non-infected samples was less clear as compared to the cotyledon samples, especially for tendral leaves inoculated with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  as for cotyledons, tendral leaves inoculated with mnsv-mα <dig> showed the greatest differentiation as compared to the controls , suggesting greater transcriptomic changes in this cultivar by mnsv-mα <dig> than in the other cases.fig.  <dig> analysis of biological variability in microarray samples. a–b principal component analysis  of cotyledon samples at  <dig> and 5 days post inoculation  , and directly inoculated leaf at  <dig> dpi , for the tendral and planters jumbo cultivars analyzed after normalization of microarray data. c–d dendrogram obtained after clustering cotyledon and directly-inoculated leaf samples. bootstrap values are shown in the boxes. the first two axes of the pca accounted for  <dig>  %  of the variability in the data in a and for  <dig>  %  in b



according to these results, mnsv-mα <dig> induced faster and more marked changes in tendral as compared to mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  an effect that could also be seen in inoculated leaves. among cultivars, the course of the infection resulted in greater differentiation among the samples of the different cultivars inoculated with the same virus.

transcriptomic remodeling in inoculated cotyledons
progression of mnsv accumulation
the quantification of the accumulation of each virus isolate in inoculated cotyledons was done through rt-qpcr at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi . an increase in viral accumulation was observed from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi in every virus/host combination, although virus accumulation was lower in the case of tendral inoculated with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> . the differences in accumulation were already detected from the first sampling date, where higher accumulation was observed in tendral/mnsv-mα <dig> and planters jumbo/mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> combinations with respect to tendral/mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  for microarray analysis, we used sampling time points  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. note that the relative increase in virus accumulation between these two time points was similar for tendral/mnsv-mα <dig> and tendral/mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  but larger for planters jumbo/mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> . the development of symptoms  induced by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> on tendral cotyledons showed a slower progression as compared to the symptoms induced by mnsv-mα <dig> in the same cultivar and of those induced by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> in planters jumbo.fig.  <dig> relative quantification of viral rna and symptoms in melon cotyledons infected with melon necrotic spot virus . a rna accumulation as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of mnsv-mα <dig>  and mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  in melon cotyledon of the tendral cultivar and mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> in melon cotyledons of the planters jumbo  cultivar. tendral samples infected with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> at 1 day post-inoculation  were used as calibrators for relative quantification. b mnsv induced symptoms in melon cotyledons at 7 days post inoculation



differentially expressed genes during infection progression
to analyze differentially expressed genes as a function of time and virus isolate, we used the microarray significant profiles package   <cit> . in tendral, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes that were associated to infection by mnsv-mα <dig>  and  <dig> genes associated to infection by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  compared to  <dig> deregulated by the latter in planters jumbo , with all virus/host combinations causing common as well as specific changes . the magnitude of deregulation at  <dig> dpi was greater in mnsv-mα5-infected tendral plants, while at  <dig> dpi mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> induced greater deregulation .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes as a function of time. a venn diagrams of differentially expressed genes as a function of time identified by masigpro in the three different virus/host combinations. in blue, differentially expressed genes in tendral cotyledons infected with mnsv-mα <dig> . in green, differentially expressed genes in tendral cotyledons infected with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> . in pink, differentially expressed genes in planters jumbo cotyledons infected with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> . b broad gene expression trends in samples analyzed by microarray. gene expression fold changes were calculated for deregulated unigenes identified by microarray analysis and used to construct box plots for each cultivar/virus/days post-inoculation  combination



to identify the main biological processes affected by each infection as a function of time, the gene ontology terms  of the differentially expressed genes were analyzed with the blast2go program  <cit> . in agreement with the number of deregulated genes, a greater number of over- and under-represented go categories were found during infection with mnsv-mα <dig> than with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> in tendral. between cultivars, the number of identified terms was lower in planters jumbo than in tendral . importantly, the go categories that were significantly affected were clearly different for the different virus/host combinations, with some commonalities but many differences among host/virus treatments . for instance, on the mnsv-mα <dig> list, we found go terms related to auxin signaling and microtubule-mediated movement as specifically represented. among the terms shared with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  we found over-represented terms that were related to the photosynthesis and chloroplast . other terms were statistically significant only for tendral infected with mnsv-mα5/3’264; among them we found many related to response to stress, response to fungus or chemical stimulus. on the planters jumbo list, the most important under-represented terms were related to translation and ribosome biogenesis, which were also present on the other two lists . in conclusion, differential transcriptomic remodeling not only referred to the number of affected genes, but also to the nature of the biological processes involved.fig.  <dig> significant gene ontology  categories of biological processes among the deregulated unigenes identified in each virus/host combination. differentially-expressed unigenes identified by the microarray analysis of cotyledon samples, over-represented  and under-represented . percentage of deregulated unigenes from the total number of unigenes included in each go category is indicated on the horizontal axis



virus-specific transcriptomic alterations
mnsv-mα <dig> and mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> deregulated a great number of genes that were specific to each virus in the same cultivar,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the functional analysis of these genes did not find statistically significant go terms. genes deregulated by both viruses in tendral were grouped according to their expression level by using the k-means algorithm  <cit> . the gene’s patterns of expression allowed the identification of  <dig> groups, where most of the genes showed changes in expression at  <dig> dpi with respect to the uninfected control, with these changes accentuated with time . most of the groups identified included genes that were co-regulated by the two viral strains; groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were composed of genes that were upregulated by both viruses with respect to the control, and groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were composed by the inhibited genes . a greater measurable deregulation of genes was found for mnsv-mα <dig> than for mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  although at 5dpi the expression levels were either equal or greater in the case of mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> . among the genes repressed by mnsv-mα <dig> and mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  many terms related to functions associated to chloroplasts and photosynthesis were found .fig.  <dig> clustering of genes that changed during the development of the mnsv infection in tendral cotyledons. the expression patterns of the mock and infected tendral cotyledons with mnsv-mα <dig> and mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> are represented by separated lines. the average expression value is represented on the y-axis. different time points of sampling are represented on the x-axis 



remarkably, among the  <dig> groups, groups  <dig> and  <dig> were composed of genes that were specifically activated or inhibited, respectively, by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> . a manual analysis of the genes in group  <dig> confirmed the functional diversity of the genes found, with genes such as those related to response to hormones such as auxins, giberellins, indole-acetic acid, as well as transcription factors and translation elongation present . selecting the genes with a fold change above  <dig> reduced the list to  <dig> genes with largely unknown functions . among the results, the unigene ccl2380contig <dig>  of unknown function, stood out, as in the samples infected with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> it was deregulated over  <dig> times with respect to its control . among the genes in group  <dig> that were inhibited by this virus, that hardly suffered modifications due to mnsv-mα <dig> infection, we found numerous ribosomal proteins, myb-family transcription factors, various oxidoreductases and proteins involved in steroid metabolism .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes included in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, of tendral with fold changes above  <dig>  a unigenes included in cluster  <dig> that are activated in tendral cotyledons infected with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> at  <dig> dpi but not by mnsv-mα <dig>  b unigenes included in cluster  <dig> that are inhibited in tendral cotyledons infected with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> at  <dig> dpi but not by mnsv-mα5



cultivar-specific transcriptomic alterations
the  <dig> genes  identified in relation to mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> infection of planters jumbo, and the  <dig>  identified in tendral, denote specific differences by cultivar in response to the same virus . the functional analysis of the  <dig> genes deregulated in planters jumbo identified the term “potassium ion transport”  as over-expressed, while the genes specifically deregulated in tendral in relation to mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> infection were related to functions associated to chloroplast, photosynthesis and defense response . the grouping of planters jumbo deregulated genes in comparison to tendral through the use of the k-means algorithm split them into  <dig> groups with different patterns of expression. in general terms, expression tendencies were similar for both cultivars. as shown before, expression levels were greater at  <dig> dpi as compared to  <dig> dpi. the analysis of go terms of the genes included in each group identified terms such as peroxidase activity, response to oxidative stress, chitinases and protein phosphorylation, associated to upregulated genes in both cultivars . remarkably, group  <dig> was composed of  <dig> genes that were deregulated by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  whose responses at  <dig> dpi were completely antagonistic, activated in planters jumbo and inhibited in tendral . within this group, numerous myb family transcription factors, ethylene response elements, many “mlo” genes and auxin response genes were found . as in the previous section, genes that had expression levels above  <dig> times as compared to their control  were selected. in this case, ccl555contig <dig>  annotated as protein l <dig> of the 60s subunit of the ribosome, stood out, being among the most activated in planters jumbo but one of the most inhibited in tendral . among these results, kinase proteins, α-glucosidases, myb family transcription factors, f-box family proteins or leucine-rich repeat proteins were also found .fig.  <dig> clustering of genes that changed during the development of mnsv infection in planters jumbo and tendral cotyledons. the expression patterns of the mock and infected tendral and planters jumbo cotyledons with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> are represented by separated lines. the average expression value is shown on the y-axis. different time points of sampling are shown in the x-axis

comparison of changes induced by mnsv with those induced by cucumber mosaic virus  or watermelon mosaic virus 
this analysis was performed with the objective of identifying common and specific transcriptomic alterations due to infection of viruses of different genera in the same host. the files corresponding to tendral cotyledons infected by cucumber mosaic virus  and watermelon mosaic virus  at  <dig> dpi were extracted from publicly-available data  <cit> . to homogenize conditions, we selected the mnsv data that corresponded to infection with mnsv-mα <dig> at  <dig> dpi in tendral. the data were normalized separately and were then analyzed using the sam algorithm   <cit> . we identified  <dig> deregulated genes for mnsv-mα <dig>   <dig> for cmv and only  <dig> for wmv. pairwise comparison identified  <dig> genes shared by wmv and mnsv-mα <dig>  which were largely peroxidases, and  <dig> between mnsv-mα <dig> and cmv . the deregulation amplitude was maximal for mnsv-mα <dig>  for which an apparent tendency of upregulation of genes could also be detected, while for cmv the inhibition of expression prevailed . in the case of wmv, the range of gene deregulation was much smaller than for the other two viruses, with deregulated genes showing fold changes that were positive for the most part .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes in tendral by three different viruses. a venn diagram of the differentially-expressed genes in tendral cotyledons infected with mnsv , cmv  and wmv  at 3 days post-inoculation  identified by sam. only one gene  was deregulated by all three viruses. b broad gene expression trends. gene expression fold changes of deregulated unigenes identified by microarray analysis were used to construct box plots for each virus



functional analysis of the genes shared by mnsv-mα <dig> and cmv did not identify categories that were statistically significant. nevertheless, manual exploration of the  <dig> shared genes identified transcripts that were annotated as wrky transcription factors, peroxidases, β- <dig>   <dig> glucanases, lipoxigenases, histones or heat-shock proteins, among others . a comparison of functional categories deregulated by each virus showed important differences among them. mnsv-mα <dig> deregulated a great number of go categories, with emphasis on processes linked to peroxidation, carbohydrate metabolism and responses to various types of stress. however, on the list of cmv-deregulated genes, only two go categories were found, among them, “sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity” , which includes a great number of transcription factors related to hormonal response regulation . among these transcription factors, a few of the basic leucine zipper domain  type, involved in the mediation of the response to salicylic acid, were activated, while many wrky and ethylene response factors  were repressed , evidencing the early regulation on the hormonal responses that cmv exerts. among the genes regulated by wmv, we identified processes related to oxidative stress as being over-represented .

the changes in common to all three viruses were minimal, only sharing the deregulation of a single gene among all three viruses . as the accumulation dynamics of wmv  <cit>  was predictably different from cmv and mnsv, we hypothesized that the dynamics of virus accumulation may have had a fundamental role in the transcriptomic alterations of the host plant. to test this hypothesis, the accumulation of the three viruses was measured in cotyledons of melon plants at different time points post-inoculation. additionally, various genes that were allegedly deregulated by viral infection  <cit>  were selected and the accumulation of their transcripts quantified at the same post-inoculation time points . viral accumulation dynamics of cmv and mnsv were very similar, accumulating to high levels within the first five days of infection . on the other hand, wmv did not start to accumulate to important levels until  <dig> dpi, in agreement with previous observations  <cit> . the deregulation in cotyledons of the different genes showed responses that paralleled viral accumulation in the case of mnsv and cmv . in the case of wmv, the response was heterogeneous, with inhibitions observed in most of the genes at earlier times, and activations when the accumulation of rna was more pronounced .fig.  <dig> comparison of the dynamics of rna accumulation of mnsv-mα <dig>  cmv and wmv in tendral cotyledons at  <dig> dpi. a relative quantification of viral rna accumulation as a function of time from mnsv, cmv and wmv-infected melon cotyledons. infected samples at  <dig> day post inoculation  were used as calibrators for relative quantification for each virus. sampling of cotyledons was done until  <dig> dpi for mnsv and  <dig> dpi for cmv and wmv. sampling of second systemic infected leaf was done at  <dig> dpi for cmv and wmv-infected plants. b rna accumulation in samples at early stages  is shown in the insert at a different scale. c rt-qpcr quantification of the accumulation of different genes in mnsv , cmv and wmv  infected plants. relative accumulation of each gene was calculated in relation to their accumulation in healthy plants for each day of sampling. the values have been log <dig> transformed



comparison of transcriptomic changes induced by mnsv in directly-inoculated leaves vs cotyledons
transcriptomic changes induced by mnsv in directly-inoculated leaves were analyzed and compared to changes in cotyledons. sampling of the directly-infected leaves was carried out when the lesions were visible, in this case at  <dig> dpi. for the identification of the differentially-expressed genes, the sam algorithm was used  <cit> . in tendral inoculated with mnsv-mα <dig>   <dig> deregulated genes were identified, while mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> only deregulated  <dig> genes in tendral and  <dig> genes in planters jumbo . the magnitude of the genetic deregulation in each tissue was correlated with the accumulation of mnsv as quantified by rt-qpcr, according to which the accumulation of the viral rna in leaves was much lower than in cotyledons even at  <dig> dpi . a functional analysis of the deregulated genes in leaves identified many statistically significant go categories that were mostly represented in cotyledons as well . the direct comparison with the genes deregulated by mnsv-mα <dig> in cotyledons at  <dig> dpi showed that more than 85 % of the genes were shared by both tissues . likewise, the functional analysis of both lists of mnsv-mα5-deregulated genes in both tissues identified various shared terms. among the over-represented go terms linked to cellular components, the endoplasmic reticulum lumen was important . altogether, mnsv induced a transcriptomic response in leaves that was of lesser magnitude as compared to that in cotyledons, or probably of slower progression, but which essentially involved the deregulation of the same processes in both tissues.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes in directly inoculated leaf  of tendral and viral load. a venn diagram of differentially expressed genes identified by sam in tendral leaf that was directly inoculated with mnsv-mα <dig> , mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  and leaf of planters jumbo  inoculated with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> . b viral load quantification in tendral leaf inoculated with mnsv-mα <dig> and mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> and planters jumbo leaf inoculated with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> compared to the viral loading in cotyledons. tendral cotyledons infected with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> at 1 day post-inoculation  were used to calibrate the relative quantification. c differentially expressed genes by mnsv-mα <dig> in directly-inoculated leaf  and in cotyledons of tendral

discussion
in this work, we have compared transcriptomic profiles of melon plants from two different cultivars infected with two different strains of mnsv. melon cultivars differed on their alleles at the nsv locus, which encodes the eif4e gene that controls susceptibility to most mnsv strains. the viral strains differed on their 3′-utrs, which have been shown to control translational efficiency of mnsv rnas and, hence, resistance-breaking capabilities.

comparison of profiles associated with two strains of mnsv that differed in their 3-utrs
our results showed that accumulation of mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> was lower to that of mnsv-mα <dig> in tendral tissues, in agreement with previous observations  <cit> . as the accumulation levels of viral rnas have been related to the intensity of the transcriptomic changes induced by certain viruses  <cit> , the reduced transcriptomic impact induced by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> at  <dig> dpi  could be thus explained. this is an important aspect, because other observations with both strains at discrete time points could be, at least partially, due to differences in their infection dynamics. for this reason we decided to do our study at two different time points and compare the expression patterns as a function of time for both strains.

both viruses activated genes involved in defense responses, oxidative stress and secondary metabolism or ubiquitin-dependent catabolic processes. primary metabolism processes, mainly photosynthesis and genes related to the chloroplasts and the organization of the cell wall, were over-represented among the genes inhibited by both viruses, leading to changes that have consistently been described for other viruses . however, there were striking differences that were mainly found in two groups of genes that had a level of activation or inhibition in response to mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> that were well above the levels of those induced by mnsv-mα <dig> infection. among these genes, various transcripts of unknown unigenes  were found, as well as transcripts that coded for resistance-related proteins , proteins involved in lipid transfer , cytochrome p <dig> cyp87a <dig> , or membrane steroid binding proteins , all belonging to a diversity of functional classes. these differences suggested differential interactions of both viral strains with the corresponding factors of the host, or at least with the routes and/or processes where these factors were involved. it is important to note that the region that was exchanged between the two viral strains does not code for any protein, but contains rna structural elements that have critical regulatory functions in a variety of viral processes, including translation, replication and transcription of sub-genomic rnas . the potential functions of the altered genes for either the virus or the host are unknown, as are the regulatory mechanisms that control the expression of these genes. in this regard, our attempts to identify common sequences shared by transcripts and viral 3′-utrs that may point toward regulation through small rnas have not been successful.

comparison of profiles associated with different varieties of melon
in agreement to previous data  <cit> , mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> reached higher levels of accumulation in planters jumbo than in tendral. however, the amplitude of the transcriptomic response of tendral was greater than in planters jumbo. the genes deregulated only in tendral were mostly related with defense processes and functions involved in photosynthesis in general and photosystem ii specifically. the decrease in photosynthetic activity has been related to defense mechanisms through the production of reactive oxygen species  derived from the chloroplasts  <cit> , and this has also been related to inhibition of photosystem ii proteins with the increase in concentration of specific viruses, suggesting their involvement in basal defense responses  <cit> . in this sense, the inhibition of these processes in tendral and in planters jumbo could be related to the launching of different basal defense responses by the different cultivars. the list of genes that were specifically deregulated in planters jumbo, however, was enriched in functions related to potassium ion transport, which could be involved in early signaling of events that take place during viral infection in this cultivar  <cit> .

planters jumbo is a cultivar that is susceptible to mnsv- <dig> and mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> but resistant to other strains  <cit> , with the resistance being due to a mutation in eif4e  <cit> . the two cultivars tested here differ in this resistance gene, but presumably also in several other genes, as they are not isogenic lines. thus, perhaps not surprisingly, both cultivars responded differently to infection by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig>  in this regard, the most remarkable finding was the unequivocal identification of a set of genes that showed antagonistic expression tendencies between both cultivars. notably, clues of cultivar-viral strain double interactions were found: among the deregulated genes, many of them coincided with those inhibited in tendral that did not suffer changes in plants infected with mnsv-mα <dig>  which suggested the importance of those genes in the infection processes by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> and its differential behavior depending on the melon genotype. among the different genes included on the list, we found myb factors , which are involved, together with wrky transcription factors, in the modulation of the plant’s hormonal expression. these factors are frequently modified as a consequence of viral infections in relation to the alteration of hormonal expression of the plant in favor of the virus or as an integrated part of the plant’s defense system  <cit> . other annotated genes included diverse protein kinases, which are an essential part of the signaling events required during defense responses, as well as related to cellular death associated to resistance . the unigene ccl555contig <dig>  annotated as coding for the l <dig> protein of the 60s ribosome subunit, showed the greatest activation in planters jumbo, and was found among those that were most inhibited in tendral, becoming a very interesting candidate for the analysis of its implication in the mnsv cycle of infection  <cit> . altogether, these genes represent potential targets for functional studies during infection with mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> and point to the differential involvement and regulation of metabolic processes between both cultivars. further research could include transcriptomic profiling of melon isogenic lines that only differ on eif4e after mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> infection.

comparison of profiles associated with different melon tissues
a possible criticism of the generic analysis of transcriptomic profiles could come from the assumption that the different cells or tissues respond in similar ways to viral infections, without taking into account specific alterations in the tissue as well as space-time variations of lesser intensity  <cit> . in this sense, the transcriptomic deregulation induced by mnsv in leaves was lesser than that in cotyledons. this was probably related to the progression of infection, which was slower in leaves than in cotyledons as shown by the levels of viral accumulation. however, there was a big overlap in the nature of the genes deregulated in leaves with those from the cotyledons. likewise, the biological functions and metabolic processes among the deregulated genes in infected leaves mostly identified the same over-represented functions in both of these tissues. these results provide validity to the general view of mnsv infections obtained in melon cotyledons.

comparison of profiles associated to infection by three different viruses
this comparison was possible due to the existence of previous data from research on infections of tendral melon plants by cmv and wmv  <cit> . as each data set come from independent experiments and with the objective of minimizing variations that could be attributed to each process of analysis, the data sets were normalized and analyzed separately following the same criteria for all three cases. after the analysis, a single gene was identified, annotated as cytokinin-o-glucosyltransferase <dig>  which was deregulated by all three viruses, but with an expression pattern that differed according to the virus, that is, activated by mnsv and wmv but inhibited by cmv. although the exact roles that cytokynins may play in plant-pathogen interactions are unknown, in arabidopsis the involvement of these hormonal routes in some responses mediated by r proteins have been identified  <cit> . the common deregulation of this gene by the different viruses could indicate its involvement in the response to viruses in melon plants  <cit> .

among mnsv and cmv, however, numerous shared genes were identified, among them, genes related to response to stress and general defense, heat shock proteins , glutathione s-transferases , transcripts that code for resistance proteins , or many wrky transcription factors, which have been identified as a response to various viruses in other hosts  <cit> . however, each virus-host interaction was unique in terms of modified biological functions, as well as in the levels of genetic deregulation. for example, cmv caused a rapid deregulation of genes related to hormonal routes, while mnsv induced a rapid defense response and the activation of oxidative stress routes in infected plants. unlike the other two viruses, the amplitude of the transcriptomic response induced by wmv was small, only activating oxidative-stress genes. a hypothesis that could explain the scarce genetic deregulation by wmv could be that the degree of response was related to the levels of viral accumulation. the quantification by rt-qpcr of a group of stress-response genes as a function of time showed the existence of correlation between the viral accumulation and the values of gene deregulation. these results suggest the existence of potential methodological errors when performing comparative analysis that use a single time point of observation or narrow temporal windows to compare different infections. besides the dynamics of viral accumulation, the common deregulation of specific genes by different viruses has also been related to the phylogenetic distance of the viruses compared  <cit> , so that new analysis and comparisons through the use of wider temporal windows and genetically-related viruses could provide more information on the processes that are commonly deregulated as a response to viral infection in melon plants.

CONCLUSIONS
by comparing transcriptomic profiles of plants from the same cultivar infected with each of the two viral strains, we have shown that there are common but also strain-specific changes, the latter referring to a variety of genes with very different functions that were affected. no obvious regulatory features shared among deregulated genes were identified. similarly, by comparing transcriptomic profiles of plants from each of the two cultivars infected with the same viral strain, common but also cultivar-specific changes were identified. again, no obvious features among deregulated genes arose, but our analysis suggested the launching of different basal defense responses resulting in differential involvement of hormonal and stress response processes. an important methodological aspect emerging from this work is the influence of infection dynamics in transcriptome profiling. when comparing different viruses or viral strains, observations done at single time points could be significantly influenced by different infection dynamics. biologically relevant data can be obtained by performing observations at different time points and comparing expression patterns as a function of time.
