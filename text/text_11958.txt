BACKGROUND
the mountain pine beetle  epidemic has affected an area of more than  <dig> million hectares of lodgepole pine  in western canada  <cit> . as the geographic range of the epidemic has expanded eastward beyond the rocky mountains, mpb has become a threat to jack pine , the dominant pine species of canada’s boreal forest. mpb has successfully colonized jack pine in the lodgepole pine/jack pine hybrid zone  <cit> . the beetle may have similar reproductive success and survival on lodgepole pine and jack pine  <cit> . while the suitability of jack pine as a major host for mpb and the ability of these trees to survive during outbreak of mpb are unknown, host range expansion of mpb from lodgepole pine into jack pine forests has heightened the risk of increased environmental impact of the mpb epidemic.

successful mpb colonization of pine trees occurs when host defences are weakened or when mass attack by mpb and associated fungi overwhelm host defences  <cit> . one of several defence mechanisms employed by conifer trees is the production of terpenoid oleoresin, which acts as a physical and chemical barrier against insect and pathogen attack  <cit> . oleoresin is stored in resin ducts of conifer bark, wood and needles and is primarily composed of c <dig> monoterpenes and c <dig> diterpene resin acids  <cit> . monoterpenes are involved in the constitutive and induced defence response of lodgepole pine against adult bark beetles, brood, and beetle-associated fungi; however, the effectiveness of monoterpenes against mpb is variable and may depend on beetle population density  <cit> . during dispersal flight, adult mpb also exploit pine monoterpenes as cues to identify suitable host trees and as precursors for their pheromone biosynthesis  <cit> . insect-associated fungi also play a role in the mpb epidemic. the mpb-associated pine pathogen grosmannia clavigera has molecular mechanisms for transport and tolerance of certain monoterpenes  <cit> . in culture, g. clavigera can use the monoterpene -limonene as a carbon source  <cit> .

lodgepole pine trees respond with induced accumulation of monoterpenes after mpb attack  <cit>  or after inoculation with g. clavigera   <cit> . lodgepole pine survival is positively correlated with high levels of oleoresin secretion after fungal inoculation  <cit> , and lodgepole pine trees with high levels of monoterpenes had decreased frequency of attack at low mpb population density  <cit> . previous analyses identified -β-phellandrene and -β-pinene as the most abundant oleoresin monoterpenes of lodgepole pine, with moderate levels of -3-carene and α-pinene also detected  <cit> . the primary monoterpenes of jack pine oleoresin were reported as α-pinene and 3-carene, with lower amounts of β-pinene, limonene and myrcene  <cit> . comparison of the volatile emissions showed that lodgepole pine emitted higher amounts of β-phellandrene and β-pinene, while jack pine emitted higher levels of α-pinene and 3-carene  <cit> . crude extracts from xylem of lodgepole pine saplings contain terpene synthase  activity for biosynthesis of -β-phellandrene, -3-carene, -β-pinene and -sabinene, consistent with the xylem monoterpene profiles  <cit> ; however the lodgepole pine and jack pine genes involved in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes are not known.

tpss catalyse the ionization, rearrangement, and often the cyclization of short-chain isoprenyl diphosphates to produce the core structures of thousands of different terpenes found in plants  <cit> . conifer mono-tpss use geranyl diphosphate  as a substrate to form, typically in a stereo-specific fashion, acyclic, monocyclic or bicyclic monoterpenes. mono-tpss can be single- or, more commonly, multi-product enzymes  <cit> . genomes of conifers harbour families of closely related mono-tpss as was evident from est analyses and full-length cdna characterization of tpss from norway spruce , sitka spruce  and white spruce   <cit> . for example, analysis of ests from sitka spruce and white spruce led to the identification and functional characterization of  <dig> mono-tpss  <cit> . in contrast, for species of pine, to the best of our knowledge only three loblolly pine  mono-tpss have been functionally characterized, which form either -α-pinene, -α-pinene, or -α-terpineol as major products  <cit> .

we report here the generation of large transcriptome sequence resources for jack pine and lodgepole pine obtained with sanger,  <dig> and illumina sequencing technologies. the quality of assemblies for flcdna discovery was evaluated by comparison with a core set of eukaryotic genes and by mining for sequences involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, specifically prenyl transferases , tpss, and cytochrome p450s of the cyp720b subfamily. these enzymes control chain length , core structures , and oxidative modifications  of terpenoids. this analysis led to the flcdna cloning and functional characterization of nine jack pine and eight lodgepole pine mono-tpss. monoterpene metabolite profiling of six tissue types from jack pine and lodgepole pine confirmed that we identified a set of mono-tpss that account for the majority of monoterpenes in these tree species.

RESULTS
generation of jack pine and lodgepole pine transcriptome sequences and assemblies
we used the sanger,  <dig> titanium, and illumina ga or illumina hiseq <dig> platforms to generate transcriptome sequences for lodgepole pine and jack pine . for sanger sequencing, we used normalized cdna libraries from wound-treated stem tissues of a single lodgepole pine tree and four jack pine trees. sequencing of the cdna resulted in  <dig>  paired-end reads for lodgepole pine and  <dig>  paired-end reads for jack pine. for  <dig> and illumina sequencing, libraries were made from the stem tissues of an individual 2-year old lodgepole pine and an individual 2-year old jack pine, both of which were wound- and methyl jasmonate-treated to induce defence responses  <cit> .  <dig> titanium sequencing resulted in approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads for lodgepole pine and jack pine, respectively. sequencing of the lodgepole pine cdna library using the illumina gaii platform yielded  <dig>  million paired-end reads, whereas sequencing of jack pine cdna using illumina hiseq <dig> technology yielded  <dig>  million paired-end reads.

sanger sequences were cap <dig> assembled  <cit> . the average insert sizes for the four normalized cdna libraries varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. the lodgepole pine and jack pine assemblies each contained approximately  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons for  <dig>  putatively unique genes . newbler  assembly of  <dig> sequences gave  <dig>  contigs for lodgepole pine and  <dig>  contigs for jack pine, which corresponded to approximately  <dig>  putatively unique genes for each species. trinity  <cit>  assembly of illumina sequences gave  <dig>  contigs for lodgepole pine and  <dig>  contigs for jack pine, which also corresponded to approximately  <dig>  putatively unique genes for each species. assemblies of sanger and  <dig> sequences, i.e. hybrid assemblies, were constructed using newbler. these assemblies gave  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs for lodgepole pine and jack pine, respectively, which represented approximately  <dig>  putatively unique genes for each species .

assessment of assemblies for flcdna recovery using cegma genes
to evaluate and compare the assemblies for flcdna recovery, each assembly was first assessed for the presence of highly conserved eukaryotic proteins using “core eukaryotic genes mapping approaches”  trained on a set of  <dig> arabidopsis thaliana core proteins  <cit> . in the lodgepole pine and jack pine sanger sequence assemblies 45-46% of the cegma protein matches were fl and an additional 37% were present but not fl . forty-four of  <dig> cegma proteins that were not found in the jack pine assembly were also absent in the lodgepole pine assembly. the lodgepole pine and jack pine  <dig> sequence assemblies had almost perfect coverage with 97-98% of the cegma proteins represented, of which 70-71% were fl. nine of the  <dig> proteins that were not detected in the lodgepole pine assembly were also not present in the jack pine assembly. similarly, the lodgepole pine and jack pine illumina sequence assemblies contained near perfect coverage  of cegma proteins, with a slightly higher percentage of fl coverage . five of the six cegma proteins that were absent in the lodgepole pine illumina assembly were also absent in the jack pine assembly. the hybrid sanger/ <dig> assemblies for lodgepole pine and jack pine each contained 97% of the cegma proteins, with approximately 70% of these being fl. most cegma genes identified in the sanger sequences were also present in the  <dig> and illumina sequences. with one exception, all of the cegma genes that were missing in the illumina sequence assemblies were also absent in the sanger and  <dig> sequence assemblies.

assessment of assemblies for flcdna recovery using terpenoid pathway genes
to assess and compare the utility of the lodgepole pine and jack pine transcriptome assemblies for flcdna discovery of terpenoid pathway genes, each assembly was queried with known pts, tpss, and cyp450s from other species. these searches identified sequences for  <dig> unique pts,  <dig> unique tpss, and  <dig> unique cyp720bs in lodgepole pine ; and  <dig> unique pts,  <dig> unique tpss and  <dig> unique cyp720bs in jack pine . we then assessed the coverage of these  <dig> and  <dig> genes with quality terms “full-length ”, “not full-length ” or “not present ” in each of the different assemblies . the  <dig> and 454/sanger sequence assemblies had the best fl coverage with, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> targets being fl for lodgepole pine, and  <dig> out of  <dig> targets being fl for jack pine. the illumina sequence assemblies had the highest overall coverage with  <dig> out of  <dig> genes present for lodgepole pine, and  <dig> out of  <dig> genes in jack pine, but these assemblies had lower fl sequence coverage. the sanger sequence assemblies contained less than half of the target genes for each species, with no fl coverage for tpss and cyp720bs for lodgepole pine and only one fl tps and one fl cyp720b for jack pine. based on these results we used the sanger/ <dig> hybrid assembly for obtaining flcdnas of pts, tpss and cyp720bs. the illumina sequences will be useful for the discovery of additional genes of these families, which will require additional efforts to produce flcdnas.

mining of the 454/sanger hybrid assembly for pt, tps, and cyp <dig> genes
overall, the lodgepole pine sanger/ <dig> hybrid assembly contained  <dig> cyp450-like contigs with  <dig> contigs representing the cyp720b subfamily. the jack pine assembly contained  <dig> cyp450-like contigs including  <dig> cyp720b contigs. as detailed above, analysis of the lodgepole pine and jack pine assemblies revealed, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> unique cyp720b putative fl sequences. blast search outputs for pt and tps sequences suggested that many of these genes were present in the assemblies with several closely related variants. such closely related variants, which are typical for gene families of secondary metabolism, are extremely difficult to resolve in sequence databases. to further assess closely related variants, all sequences identified as pts or tpss were isolated from the larger sequence datasets and re-assembled using phrap  <cit>  to obtain an improved set of pt and tps candidates. mining of the lodgepole pine phrap assembly identified  <dig> pt and  <dig> tps sequences. mining of the jack pine phrap assembly identified  <dig> pt and  <dig> tps candidates. further manual inspection of the tps candidates to remove sequences with mis-spliced introns or obvious sequence problems revealed a set of  <dig> fl and  <dig> partial tps sequences in lodgepole pine , and  <dig> fl and  <dig> partial candidate tpss in jack pine . analysis of the pt sequences identified  <dig> fl and  <dig> partial sequences from lodgepole pine, and  <dig> fl and  <dig> partial sequences from jack pine.

cloning and characterization of mono-tps fl cdnas
within the set of  <dig> lodgepole pine tpss and  <dig> jack pine tpss we searched for the subset of mono-tpss using blast searches and expert sequence assessments against previously known conifer mono-tpss, including those described in keeling et al.  <cit> . characterization of di-tpss was recently published  <cit> . we found  <dig> fl and  <dig> partial mono-tps candidates for lodgepole pine, and  <dig> fl and  <dig> partial mono-tps candidates for jack pine. fl mono-tpss were recovered from plasmids used for sanger sequencing or by pcr using cdna template. rapid amplification of cdna ends  led to the cloning of additional fl mono-tpss. we cloned a total of  <dig> lodgepole pine and  <dig> jack pine fl mono-tps cdnas for recombinant expression in e. coli and characterization of tps enzyme functions. eight lodgepole pine and  <dig> jack pine tps proteins showed activity with gpp as a substrate, confirming their identity as mono-tpss. assays using neryl diphosphate as a substrate produced only trace amounts of monoterpene products, and no product formation was detected with farnesyl diphosphate  or geranylgeranyl diphosphate .

functional characterization of - and -α-pinene, -β-phellandrene, and -camphene synthases
mono-tps enzymes that produced product profiles dominated by 92% and 88% -α-pinene were cloned from lodgepole pine  and jack pine , respectively . these proteins had 98% amino acid sequence identity to each other and to the previously characterized loblolly pine -α-pinene synthase  <cit> . two additional jack pine candidates  had 98% sequence identity to each other and 90% identity to the -α-pinene synthases; however, these proteins showed no activity with gpp, ggpp or fpp. one protein from each species  produced 77-78% -α-pinene and 10% -β-pinene. these proteins also had 98% amino acid sequence identity to each other and to loblolly pine -α-pinene synthase  <cit> .

two lodgepole pine cdnas  and one jack pine cdna  had 95-99% protein sequence identity to each other and had 70% sequence identity to pbtps-αpin <dig>  pctps-αpin1and pttps-αpin <dig>  these enzymes produced 82-88% -β-phellandrene as the dominant product . a third lodgepole pine candidate  had 95% identity to both the jack pine and lodgepole pine -β-phellandrene synthases, and 70% identity to the -α-pinene synthases, but produced 29% -camphene and 26% -α-pinene along with other minor products .

functional characterization of -β-pinene, α-terpineol, and -3-carene synthases
two lodgepole pine mono-tps candidates  and two jack pine candidates  had 96-98% amino acid sequence identity to each other and 91-93% sequence identity to loblolly pine -α-terpineol synthase  <cit> . surprisingly, none of these four proteins produced α-terpineol but instead produced 75-81% -β-pinene and 8–13% -α-pinene . the second lodgepole pine candidate  did not show any activity with gpp, fpp or ggpp, either as fl or truncated protein lacking the putative plastid targeting sequence. a third jack pine protein  had 92-97% sequence identity to the -β-pinene synthases but instead produced a mixture of 39% -α-pinene and 33% -β-pinene.

one candidate from each of jack pine  and lodgepole pine  had 92% sequence identity to each other and formed α-terpineol as the major product. these proteins had only 62% sequence identity to the pttps-αterp  <cit>  and were most closely related  to  <dig> -cineole synthases from white spruce and a white spruce hybrid  <cit> . surprisingly, analysis of the stereochemistry of the α-terpineol product suggested that pbtps-αterp produced a mixture of 44%  and 56% -enantiomers, whereas pctps-αterp produced only the -enantiomer. pbtps-αterp also produced 17% terpin-4-ol, 10% geraniol, 9% terpinolene and 5% -limonene, while pctps-αterp produced 32%  <dig> -cineole, 9% -sabinene and 8% myrcene as additional products .

two jack pine candidates 3car <dig>  pbtps3car1) and one lodgepole pine candidate 3car1) produced 56-68% -3-carene and approximately 10% terpinolene . these proteins had 88–96% protein sequence identity to each other and were most closely related  to -3-carene synthases from norway spruce, sitka spruce and white spruce  <cit> .

monoterpene profiles of jack pine and lodgepole pine
to assess if products of the recombinant mono-tps proteins were present in pine tissues, monoterpenes were extracted and analysed from the apical buds, leader stem, young needles , first interwhorl stem, mature needles  and roots of 3-year old jack pine and lodgepole pine saplings. in both pine species, the roots contained the lowest amount of total monoterpenes . five of the six tissues of lodgepole pine contained 52-58% -β-phellandrene and 20-35% -β-pinene as the two most abundant monoterpenes, with the exception that lodgepole pine roots contained 21% -β-phellandrene, 33% -β-pinene and 32% -3-carene. all lodgepole pine tissues contained approximately 3% -α-pinene and the lodgepole pine apical buds, interwhorl stem and leader stem contained 7-8% -3-carene and less than 1% of several additional monoterpenes including -α-pinene, -β-pinene, myrcene, terpinolene and both isomers of limonene and camphene .

leader stem and interwhorl stem tissues of jack pine contained a complex mixture of monoterpenes, containing 26-29% -3-carene, 21% -α-pinene and 18% -β-pinene, 8-10% -α-pinene, 7% -limonene, 4-5% bornyl acetate and 2% -β-phellandrene, myrcene and terpinolene. monoterpene profiles of jack pine needles contained 15-24% -β-pinene, 14–18% bornyl acetate as well as 6-15% of -α-pinene, -α-pinene, -3-carene, -β-phellandrene, -limonene. jack pine apical buds contained 27% -3-carene, 20% -β-pinene, 6% bornyl acetate, 7% -α-pinene as well as 11% -α-pinene and -limonene .

phylogeny of the lodgepole pine and jack pine mono-tpss
a neighbour joining phylogeny placed all of the fl jack pine and lodgepole pine mono-tpss within the tps-d <dig> family . many of the jack pine and lodgepole pine mono-tpss grouped together with functionally related mono-tpss from other conifer species. for example, the jack pine and lodgepole pine -3-carene synthases grouped together with spruce -3-carene synthases  <cit>  and the pseudotsuga menziesii terpinolene synthase  <cit> . similarly, the pine -α-pinene synthases  grouped most closely with spruce and fir enzymes that produce -α-pinene and -β-pinene  <cit> . conversely, the lodgepole pine and jack pine -β-pinene synthases grouped together with the loblolly pine -α-terpineol synthase  <cit>  and were most closely related to the spruce -β-phellandrene synthases  <cit> , whereas the jack pine and lodgepole pine α-terpineol synthases grouped together with spruce enzymes that produce -linalool and  <dig> -cineole . the jack pine and lodgepole pine -β-phellandrene synthases grouped together with pine -α-pinene synthases  and grouped separately from other previously characterized conifer -β-phellandrene synthases  <cit> .

discussion
identification of fl transcripts of genes of terpenoid metabolism
we present transcriptome sequence resources generated with sanger,  <dig>  and illumina technologies to enable gene discovery in jack pine and lodgepole pine. different assemblies were generated to assess the ability to reconstruct fl transcripts. previous work identified newbler as ideal for obtaining fl transcripts from  <dig> sequences of non-model organisms  <cit> . we also used the trinity assembler to process illumina sequences. tblastn searches of the assemblies using cegma  <cit>  proved useful as a general assessment of fl transcript recovery. the shorter length of the illumina sequences did not appear to be a disadvantage and appeared to be compensated by the depth of coverage, which allowed us to recover most of the cegma genes with fl transcripts in both pine species.

a major challenge of conifer transcriptome analysis is the proper assembly of fl sequences of members of multigene families, where closely related members have divergent functions, and which are characteristic of secondary metabolism. tps and p <dig> genes such as the conifer tps-d and cyp720b genes are examples of such multigene families  <cit> . as a strategy for discovery and resolution of members of large gene families such as the tpss in conifers we used the re-assembly of target genes after initial large-scale de novo transcriptome assembly. we have previously used this approach as part of a transcriptome assembly and gene discovery pipeline that was validated with known conifer di-tpss and led to the successful discovery of new di-tps genes of previously unknown functions in balsam fir   <cit> , lodgepole pine, and jack pine  <cit> .

mono-tpss accounted for major components of the monoterpene metabolite profiles of lodgepole pine and jack pine
the dominant monoterpenes across the different organ and tissue types of lodgepole pine were -β-phellandrene and -β-pinene . consistent with these profiles, two -β-phellandrene synthases and one -β-pinene synthase were characterized from lodgepole pine. additional mono-tpss were also characterized from lodgepole pine that produced -α-pinene, -α-pinene, -camphene, -3-carene, and α-terpineol. the most abundant monoterpenes in jack pine were -α-pinene, -α-pinene, -β-pinene and -3-carene. we identified the mono-tpss responsible for the biosynthesis of these metabolites as well as the synthases that produce -β-phellandrene and α-terpineol. bornyl acetate and -limonene were also present in moderate amounts in all jack pine tissues tested. however, the synthases responsible for the production of these compounds have not been identified. in other conifers, mono-tpss that produce -limonene have been identified from grand fir  <cit> , norway spruce  <cit>  and sitka spruce  <cit> . crude enzyme extracts from liverwort  catalyse the conversion of gpp to bornyl diphosphate  <cit> , the likely precursor to bornyl acetate. a gene responsible for the biosynthesis of -bornyl diphosphate was characterized in salvia officinalis <cit> . however, the genes involved in bornyl acetate biosynthesis have not been identified in any conifer species. the sequences of the tpss that produce the remainder of the monoterpenes detected in lodgepole pine and jack pine, including -limonene and bornyl acetate, are likely to be present within our assemblies in the form of partial transcripts. additional approaches, such as targeted race, may be required to obtain the fl cdnas for functional characterization. among the partial or uncharacterized mono-tps-like genes from jack pine and lodgepole pine, there may also be tpss that use dimethylallyl diphosphate as a substrate to produce hemiterpenes, as was recently shown in pinus sabiniana <cit> . this possibility will be tested in future work. using lodgepole pine and jack pine transcriptome resources, the discovery of a set of bifunctional and monofunctional di-tpss was recently reported  <cit> . together, these di-tpss and the mono-tpss described here account for the majority of oleoresin defence compounds of lodgepole pine and jack pine.

the discovery of two -3-carene synthases from jack pine and one -3-carene synthase from lodgepole pine may suggest that copy number variation in the -3-carene synthases account for the difference in -3-carene content in these trees, similar to the copy number variation of -3-carene phenotypes in sitka spruce  <cit> . previous research has identified -3-carene as important in the defence of chinese pine  against the red turpentine beetle  and its associated fungus   <cit> . additionally, -3-carene is associated with the resistance of sitka spruce to the white pine weevil  <cit> . the -3-carene content in all tissue types of jack pine was higher than the content of the corresponding tissue in lodgepole pine, consistent with previous comparisons of jack pine and lodgepole pine volatile emission and oleoresin content  <cit> . the monoterpene content in lodgepole pine, including -3-carene, has strong genetic  <cit>  and geographical  <cit>  components, and has important consequences in mpb host colonization  <cit> .

functional diversification of jack pine and lodgepole pine mono-tpss
gene duplication followed by sub- and neo-functionalization is likely the origin of the large conifer tps gene family of oleoresin biosynthesis  <cit> . the  <dig> mono-tpss characterized in this study provide additional insight into the molecular underpinnings of the monoterpene diversity observed across conifer species. the jack pine and lodgepole pine mono-tps genes are members of the tps-d <dig> family containing conifer mono-tpss  <cit> . many of the pine monotpss, including the genes responsible for -3-carene and -α-pinene biosynthesis, group phylogenetically with functionally similar mono-tpss from loblolly pine, grand fir and spruce. this functional conservation across species suggests that considerable gene duplication and functionalization occurred prior to the speciation of pine, fir and spruce.

the jack pine and lodgepole pine -α-pinene synthases and -β-phellandrene synthases grouped together with the previously characterized loblolly pine -α-pinene synthase  <cit>  as a unique and apparently pinus specific subclade within the tps-d family . the jack pine and lodgepole pine -β-phellandrene synthases grouped separately from the sitka spruce  <cit>  and grand fir -β-phellandrene synthases  <cit>  highlighting the multiple origins of -β-phellandrene biosynthesis in conifers. genes that produce -α-pinene as their major product have not been identified in any conifer genus other than pinus, suggesting this function may have evolved in the pine lineage after the separation from spruces and firs.

three proteins from jack pine and lodgepole pine shared 91-93% sequence identity with the previously characterized loblolly pine -α-terpineol synthase. based on sequence identity, one may have predicted that the jack pine and lodgepole pine proteins would similarly produce α-terpineol. surprisingly, these proteins produced 75-81% -β-pinene and no α-terpineol. previous reports demonstrate that a few amino acid substitutions are sufficient to alter the product profiles of mono-tpss from grand fir  <cit> . the high level of sequence identity between these functionally distinct proteins from jack pine, lodgepole pine and loblolly pine serves as an example of the functional plasticity observed in conifer mono-tps.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we present large transcriptome resources for lodgepole pine and jack pine generated on sanger,  <dig> and illumina sequencing platforms. beyond using highly conserved plant and eukaryotic genes for quality assessment of assemblies, we successfully focused on flcdna recovery and resolution of closely related sequences characteristic of large gene families of conifer defence and secondary metabolism. expert-curated assemblies and annotation identified a substantial number of terpenoid pathway genes in the two pine species investigated here. the closely related jack pine and lodgepole pine have unique monoterpene profiles that function as defences and semiochemicals in the interactions with mpb and mpb-associated fungi as well as other pests. the diverse and different functions of the trees’ mono-tpss identified here account for many of the major and minor monoterpenes in different tissues, yet also point to enzymes of terpene biosynthesis which remain to be discovered. the genes identified provide a foundation to further investigate the role of these compounds as well their intra- and interspecific variations and dynamics in the defence of jack pine and lodgepole pine to the mpb.
