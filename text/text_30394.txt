BACKGROUND
akt  plays an important role in promoting the survival of many cells. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is activated in the growth factor-mediated signaling cascade, generating the secondary messengers phosphatidylinositol- <dig>  4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol- <dig> ,5-trisphosphate , which recruit akt to the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. akt, anchored to the membrane via pip <dig>  is phosphorylated and activated by both 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase- <dig> -mediated phosphorylation of akt at thr <dig> and pdk- <dig> -mediated phosphorylation of akt at ser <dig>  activated akt subsequently phosphorylates and activates downstream target proteins, thereby promoting cell survival  <cit> .

an insufficiency of the akt signaling has been assumed to contribute to the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, cancer, and diabetes  <cit> . in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a representative motor-neuron-specific neurodegenerative disease, levels of akt phospholylation have been reported to be diminished, which may lead to motor neuronal death  <cit> .

btbd <dig> is a unique akt activator  <cit> . it activates akt by binding to both akt and pp2a and by inhibiting pp2a-mediated dephosphorylation of akt. overexpression of btbd <dig> increases akt phosphorylation, whereas loss-of-function of btbd <dig> decreases akt phosphorylation in neuronal and pancreatic beta cells. consequently, overexpression of btbd <dig> inhibits neuronal death caused by expression of a familial als-linked gene g93a-superoxide dismutase  <dig>   <cit> . another study has shown that overexpression of btbd <dig>  promotes the growth of pancreatic beta cells, whereas knockdown of endogenous btbd <dig> expresion decreases high glucose-induced cell proliferation and insulin-stimulated akt phosphorylation  <cit> . the level of btbd <dig> expression is reduced in motor neurons in spinal cords of sporadic als patients  <cit>  where tdp- <dig> aggregates are formed  <cit> . disruption of the btbd- <dig> gene has been shown to cause loss of motor neurons and impairment of motor performance in caenorhabditis elegans <cit> . these results suggest that reduction of btbd <dig> expression may contribute to motor neuronal death. in addition, the level of btbd <dig> expression has been shown to be downregulated in a rat intracerebral hemorrhage model  <cit> .

because the levels of btbd <dig> expression are much lower in many non-nervous tissues than nervous tissues  <cit> , there may be a relative of btbd <dig> that has btbd <dig> function in non-neuronal cells.

in the current study, we investigated kctd <dig> , an isoform of btbd <dig>  <cit> . similar to btbd <dig>  kctd <dig> was found to associate with all akt isoforms and pp2a and upregulate its phospholylation level at thr <dig> 

RESULTS
kctd <dig> is a relative of btbd10
the gene encoding 419-amino-acid human kctd <dig> is located in chromosome  <dig>  while that encoding 475-amino-acid human btbd <dig> is in chromosome  <dig>  the overall similarity in the amino acid sequence between human btbd <dig> and kctd <dig> is  <dig> % . the c-terminal 330-amino-acid region of btbd <dig> is responsible for the binding of btbd <dig> to akt  <cit> . the similarity in the amino acid sequence between the c-terminal 330-amino-acid regions of btbd <dig> and kctd <dig> is  <dig> %  . the kctd <dig> gene is highly conserved among different mammalian species. the similarity in the amino acid sequence between human  and mouse  kctd <dig> is 94% .

kctd <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues, including nervous tissues . compared with btbd <dig>  levels of kctd <dig> expression in non-nervous tissues except testis, spleen, and colon, are equal to or higher than those in nervous tissues.

kctd <dig> interacts with akt or a catalytic subunit of pp2a
btbd <dig> binds to all akt isoforms and upregulates their phosphorylation by inhibiting their dephosphorylation by pp2a  <cit> . gst-pulldown assays showed that kctd <dig> was co-precipitated with gst-tagged akt  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> but not with gst . kctd <dig> also co-precipitated with the gst-tagged catalytic subunit of pp1a and pp2a  <cit> . theses results show that kctd <dig> binds to all akt isoforms, pp1a, and pp2a.

overexpression of kctd <dig> upregulates the level of akt phospholylation at thr308
based on the finding that kctd <dig> interacts with all akt isoforms and catalytic subunits of protein phosphatases, we next examined the effect of overexpression of kctd <dig> on the level of akt phosphorylation. nsc <dig> motor neuronal cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding btbd <dig> or kctd <dig>  the level of akt phosphorylation at thr <dig> was increased by overexpression of btbd <dig> as well as kctd <dig>  and this result was reproduced in another identical experiment . in contrast, the level of akt phosphorylation at ser <dig> was not apparently upregulated by kctd <dig> .

intracellular localization of kctd <dig> is similar to btbd10
btbd <dig> intracellularly localizes in cytoplasm and shows a unique filamentous structure  <cit> . in the present study, kctd <dig> also localized in cytoplasm and had a filamentous structure . to examine whether kctd <dig> colocalizes with btbd <dig>  we coexpressed his-xpress-tagged human kctd <dig> and btbd <dig> in cos <dig> cells and immunostained them using xpress and btbd <dig> antibodies. kctd <dig> and btbd <dig> colocalized in the same filamentous structure .

expression of kctd <dig> is not downregulated in motor neurons in als mice
decreased expression of btbd <dig> has been suggested to cause motor neuron death via the downregulation of the level of phospho-akt  <cit> . immunohistochemical analysis of frozen sections of mouse spinal cords with the kctd <dig> antibody has shown that kctd <dig> is expressed in motor neurons in anterior horns of spinal cords . in a previous study  <cit> , levels of btbd <dig> expression were found to be downregulated in motor neurons in the spinal cords of g93a-sod <dig> transgenic mice at advanced stages of als. we therefore examined levels of kctd <dig> expression in the same g93a-sod <dig> transgenic mice. at an early symptomatic stage , the level of kctd <dig> expression in g93a-sod <dig> transgenic mouse motor neurons was similar to that in motor neurons in wild-type littermates. although the level of btbd <dig> expression was decreased in motor neurons of g93a-sod <dig> transgenic mice, compared with that of wild-type littermates, at 120 days  <cit> , the level of kctd <dig> expression was not decreased at 120 days or 140 days .

discussion
in the current study, we identified kctd <dig>  an isoform of btbd <dig>  as a novel putative akt or pp2a-interacting protein. based on the result that overexpression of kctd <dig> increased the level of akt phosphorylation at thr <dig>  it is highly likely that similarly to btbd <dig>  kctd <dig> positively regulates akt . on the other hand, overexpression of kctd <dig> or btbd <dig> did not apparently increase the level of phosphorylation of akt at ser <dig> . the previous study also showed that overexpression of btbd <dig> only weakly increased the level of phosphporylation of akt at ser <dig> while it increased the level of phosphporylation of akt at thr <dig> in a definitive manner  <cit> .

phosphorylation of akt at thr <dig> and ser <dig> is catalyzed by different kinases, i.e., pdk- <dig> and pdk- <dig> , respectively  <cit> . similarly, phosphatases involved in the dephosphorylation of akt at ser <dig> may be different from those required for dephosphorylation of akt at thr <dig>  the putative phosphatases of akt have been proposed to be pp2a  <cit>  and phlpp <dig>   <cit> . zhuo et al. has recently reported that cstp <dig> is a specific phosphatase of akt at ser <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that kctd <dig> and btbd <dig> may preferentially interact with the phosphatase of akt at thr <dig> 

phosphorylations of akt at both thr <dig> and ser <dig> are necessary for the full activation of akt  <cit> . however, it has also been suggested that phosphorylation at ser <dig> may be unnecessary for activation of the majority of downstream akt targets, such as tsc <dig>  gsk <dig>  and the torc <dig> effectors, s6k and 4e-bp <dig> but necessary for foxo1/3a  <cit> . therefore, dysregulation of the function of kctd <dig> and btbd <dig> may affect many cellular processes by changing the phosphorylation of akt at thr <dig> 

akt may act as an inhibitor of neuronal apoptosis and loss-of-function of akt may contribute to the pathogenesis of als. in support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that levels of phospho-akt are decreased in motor neurons of spinal cords of als  <cit> , administration of igf- <dig> or vegf, which activates akt, prolongs the lifespan of als model mice  <cit> , and vegf-deficient mice show an als-like phenotype  <cit> .

the level of btbd <dig> expression has recently been shown to be downregulated in motor neurons in sporadic human als cases  <cit> . notably, the level of btbd <dig> expression is downregulated only in motor neurons that contain tdp- <dig> aggregates  <cit> . in a previous study  <cit> , btbd <dig> expression was also shown to be downregulated in motor neurons in g93a-sod <dig> mice at advanced als stages. on the other hand, kctd <dig> expression was not downregulated in motor neurons in g93a-sod <dig> mice at advanced als stages . this finding suggests that kctd <dig> is not involved in the als pathogenesis in contrast to btbd <dig>  however, this needs to be confirmed by examining whether kctd <dig> expression is unchanged in motor neurons in other als mouse models  and als patients.

levels of kctd <dig> expression in a majority of non-nervous tissues were found to be equal to or higher than those in nervous tissues , whereas levels of btbd <dig> expression have previously been shown to be much lower in the majority of non-nervous tissues than nervous tissues  <cit> . this finding on tissue distribution suggests that kctd <dig> plays a major role as an akt activator in these non-nervous as well as nervous tissues and dysregulation of kctd <dig> may be linked to diseases involving these tissues. detailed characterization of the function of kctd <dig> will serve as an important hint to the understanding of akt-related biological events.

CONCLUSIONS
kctd <dig> is a novel positive regulator of akt phosphorylation at thr <dig>  kctd <dig> may be involved in cellular process via akt in non-nervous and nervous tissues.
