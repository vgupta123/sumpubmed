BACKGROUND
the brassica genus comprises a large number of cultivated crop species, including oilseeds , vegetables  and condiments   <cit> . six of the cultivated brassica species share a unique genomic relationship. brassica rapa , b. nigra  and b. oleracea  are diploids. ancestral hybridisation events between these species gave rise to the allotetraploid species b. juncea , b. napus  and b. carinata   <cit> . due to this genomic relationship, there exists great potential for transfer of useful alleles between these species for agricultural benefit  <cit> . the allotetraploid crops  can be recreated from the modern-day diploids to broaden their genetic bases for breeding purposes  <cit> . this involves introgressing novel genetic variation and useful alleles from the diploid species, which include many wild species, countering recent reductions in genetic diversity in the crop-type allopolyploids . in addition, a new species could potentially be created with genomic composition 2n = 6x = aabbcc =  <dig> from crosses between the diploids and/or allotetraploids, with greater potential for allelic heterosis and hence hybrid vigour  <cit> .

however, a major obstacle to the success of these breeding approaches is the high rate of abnormal meiosis in resynthesised brassica allopolyploids  <cit> . this has been demonstrated in both synthetic b. napus  recreated from crosses between b. rapa  and b. oleracea   <cit> , as well as in allohexaploids  created from crosses between b. rapa  and b. carinata   <cit> . this meiotic instability manifests as non-homologous interactions between the closely related a- and c-genome chromosomes during meiosis , and results in loss of chromosomes, instability of generational inheritance and infertility in subsequent generations . in contrast, b. napus  is a functionally diploid species, with a regular disomic mode of chromosome inheritance  <cit> , despite the close relationship of the a and c genomes  <cit> . this improved genetic control may have arisen soon after the formation of b. napus via mutation resulting in novel genetic variation or by accumulation of minor alleles inherited from the parent diploids. alternatively, the diploid progenitors of the first b. napus lines may have had inherently greater genetic control of meiosis than the b. rapa and/or b. oleracea germplasm used to experimentally resynthesise b. napus. quantitative trait loci  contributing to genetic regulation of meiotic behaviour in b. napus have been identified  <cit> . however, strong qualitative effects on homoeologous pairing, such as those observed for the ph <dig> locus of wheat  <cit> , have yet to be discovered.

previously, we developed a novel method for generating allohexaploid brassica using only allotetraploid species  <cit> . in a two-step process, crosses between b. juncea, b. napus and b. carinata generated a novel near-allohexaploid plant with the hypothesis that they would inherit meiotic stability alleles from each of the natural allotetraploid species  <cit> . hypothetically, meiotic stability alleles from natural allotetraploid brassica species may be effective in regulating homologous chromosome pairing and transmission in this synthetic allohexaploid brassica hybrid. we also assessed a- and c-genome allele and chromosome transmission in an f <dig> population derived from this f <dig> hybrid  <cit> .

in this study, we developed  <dig> microspore-derived  progeny from the novel near-allohexaploid hybrid  and genotyped these progeny using the illumina 60k brassica snp chip and ssr markers. hence, homologous and homoeologous crossover frequency and distribution across and between each of the a, b and c genomes could be assessed for the first time in a trigenomic brassica hybrid. dna content  and fertility  data were also collected and compared to  <dig> self-pollinated  and  <dig> open-pollinated  progeny derived from the same hybrid.fig.  <dig> the four-generation  pedigree used in this experiment. interspecific hybridisation between b. napus and b. carinata  generated an unbalanced ccab hybrid . an unreduced, aneuploid gamete from the ccab hybrid combined with a reduced gamete from b. juncea to produce a near-allohexaploid hybrid  missing three b. napus a-genome chromosomes and two b. carinata b-genome chromosomes. the near-allohexaploid was subjected to microspore culture to produce a population of  <dig> microspore-derived progeny 



RESULTS
genome coverage of molecular markers
of the  <dig> snp markers on the brassica 60k infinium snp chip,  <dig> were selected on the basis of polymorphism between the parental lines and lack of evidence of cross-amplification between the a and c genomes in this population. the set of snp markers used in this study was manually clustered in genome studio for these genotypes previously  and markers that showed more than three genotype clusters or were heterozygous in the control genotypes  were removed. in total,  <dig> markers in the a genome and  <dig> in the c genome were retained; with polymorphic snp markers per chromosome ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  . snp genotyping of the population of  <dig> microspore-derived  progeny showed that  <dig> md progeny had only one parental allele at most loci, indicating that these progeny were derived from reduced  gametes. one md progeny  was heterozygous at most a- and c-genome loci, consistent with its derivation from an unreduced gamete by first division restitution; this individual was removed from subsequent analyses. three pairs of individuals had identical molecular marker results, consonant with their production from twinned embryos during the microspore culture process  <cit> . one individual from each pair was removed from subsequent analyses .

of the  <dig> ssr primer pairs screened,  <dig> detected polymorphisms in the b genome between the b. juncea and b. carinata parent genotypes, amplifying  <dig> b-genome specific alleles. of these  <dig> b-genome marker alleles,  <dig> were contributed by the b. juncea parent and  <dig> by the b. carinata parent. coverage of the b. juncea and b. carinata b-genome chromosomes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> ssr loci per chromosome .

the molecular karyotype of the near-allohexaploid hybrid as deduced from the presence and absence of parental snp and ssr marker alleles in the four-generation pedigree is shown in fig.  <dig>  inheritance of marker alleles in the microspore-derived population was used to infer the molecular karyotype of the near-allohexaploid hybrid.fig.  <dig> graphical representation of the chromosome composition of the near-allohexaploid hybrid used in this experiment, inferred from molecular karyotyping of a four-generation pedigree . the asterisk indicates a homoeologous non-reciprocal translocation from cc <dig> to an <dig>  note that homologous recombination occurred in the ccab hybrid  to produce recombinant c-genome chromosomes



all b. juncea a-genome  chromosomes were present in the near-allohexaploid hybrid, but three b. napus a-genome chromosomes  were lost in the formation of the aabbcc hybrid . all other a-genome chromosomes were present and unrecombined, except for an an <dig> – cc <dig> homoeologous non-reciprocal translocation , a duplication of part of chromosome an <dig> that appeared to be pre-existing in the parental b. napus line, as described previously  <cit> ; and a small cc <dig> duplication – an <dig> deletion. all eight b. juncea b-genome  chromosomes were present in the near-allohexaploid hybrid , but two b. carinata chromosomes  were lost, with no alleles present from either chromosome . all c-genome chromosomes were transmitted to the near-allohexaploid hybrid . extensive homologous recombination between the b. napus and b. carinata c genomes  in the cnccanbc hybrid resulted in fixation  of 22 % of c genome loci in the md population . recombinant cn/cc chromosomes resulting from normal homologous recombination in the cnccanbc hybrid meiosis were also detected in the md population as sudden reversals of allelic scoring phase .

transmission of alleles to the md population
the normality of meiosis in the near-allohexaploid hybrid was first assessed by measuring the transmission frequencies of marker alleles to the md population . transmission frequencies did not significantly deviate from the expected 50 % for  <dig> of the total  <dig> marker allele bins  distributed across the a genome . the most significant deviations were observed for alleles located on the ends of chromosomes a <dig> and a <dig>  where b. napus alleles were present more often than predicted by chance. alleles located on the three a-genome chromosomes that were unpaired  each behaved differently: aj <dig> alleles were retained more often than predicted by chance in the population , aj <dig> alleles were present as often as expected  while aj <dig> alleles were lost a little more often than expected  . excluding univalent chromosomes on which non-homologous recombination events had occurred, only inheritance of aj <dig> significantly deviated from expected inheritance ratios for a univalent chromosome in the a genome .

marker alleles located on pairs of b-genome chromosomes showed no detectable bias towards retention of either b. juncea or b. carinata alleles . by contrast, univalent chromosomes bj <dig> and bj <dig> both showed highly significant deviation from expected transmission ratios: bj <dig> was preferentially retained  and bj <dig> was preferentially lost  .

most b. napus and b. carinata c-genome marker alleles were transmitted normally from the near-allohexaploid hybrid to the md population ; additional file 3: table s3; additional file 4: figure s3). strong segregation distortion towards retention of b. napus alleles was observed at the bottom of chromosome c <dig> . other regions of segregation distortion were observed on chromosomes c <dig> and c <dig>  with a more significant bias towards retention of b. carinata c-genome alleles at the top of chromosome c <dig> .

copy number analysis of a, b and c genome chromosomes in the md population
standard snp marker genotyping does not capture the full extent of homoeologous chromosome interactions, which can result in changes in allele copy numbers. therefore, we conducted snp marker allele copy number analysis to detect the deviations from regular chromosome transmission in the md progeny. deviations from expected copy numbers were indeed observed, including  <dig> instances of anomalous extra chromosomes and  <dig> instances of chromosomes present in only a single copy in “2n” progeny . duplication/deletion events involving partial chromosomes were also assessed. twice as many deletion events  were observed in the population compared to duplication events , excluding the pre-existing duplication on chromosome a <dig> .fig.  <dig> relative chromosome copy number variation within each individual in a microspore-derived population resulting from a trigenomic brassica hybrid. asterisks indicate chromosomes with only one copy in the parent hybrid. one missing chromosome was only assessed in somatically-doubled “2n” progeny, and extra chromosome refers to either two copies in an “n” progeny, or three or four copies in a “2n” progeny



unbalanced translocations, where a duplication of a homoeologous region was not accompanied by a corresponding deletion in another homoeologous region, were more common than balanced translocations . however, balanced translocations were far more likely to be observed than expected  assuming mendelian segregation of a single homoeologous translocation event between two chromatids in a homoeologous set .

pairwise allele associations reveal regular homologous chromosome interactions
the regularity of meiotic interactions between homologous chromosomes in the near-allohexaploid hybrid was assessed by detecting associations between all pairs of alleles segregating in the md population, following the novel method described in  <cit> . all aj/an alleles for which a homologous chromosome pair was present  segregated with high fidelity in the md population, as evidenced by the strong diagonal in the allele association plot shown in fig. 4a. exceptions were the bottom third of chromosome a <dig> and an interstitial part of chromosome a <dig> . in the b genome, all bj and bc alleles for which a homologous chromosome pair was present  segregated with high fidelity . all cn/cc alleles showed regular segregation and putative homologous pairing as assessed by allele transmission to the md population , except for the bottom ends of c <dig> and c <dig> fig.  <dig> allele segregation indicative of pairing between homologous  a-genome chromosomes ,  b-genome chromosomes  and  c-genome chromosomes  in a near-allohexaploid hybrid. allele segregation was assessed in a population of  <dig> progeny derived from microspores of a 2n = ajanbjbccncc hybrid. only non-redundant snp alleles are presented, arranged sequentially according to their genetic location . the bonferroni multiple testing p-value correction for p <  <dig>  significance is p <  <dig>  in this analysis



the potential occurrence of meiotic interactions between non-homologous chromosomes was investigated using the same allele association approach. there was no statistical support for autosyndetic allele segregation  as seen by the absence of off-diagonal associations in fig.  <dig>  two significant allosyndetic allele segregation associations were observed: one association between parts of a <dig> and c6; and one terminal association  between a <dig> and c <dig> 

haplotype block analysis in the md population reveals frequency of homologous and homoeologous meiotic recombination in the near-allohexaploid hybrid
putative crossover events during meiosis in the near-allohexaploid hybrid were inferred by inspection of allele segregation patterns for each chromatid in the six parental subgenomes  in the md population. recombination breakpoints were evidenced by the presence of alleles from one parental subgenome for only part of one chromatid; lack of recombination was evidenced either by complete presence or complete absence of all alleles from that parental subgenome on that chromatid for any given md individual. if the presence of one allele perfectly matched the absence of another allele from a homologous or homoeologous genome, a recombination event was predicted to have occurred.

univalent chromosomes aj <dig>  aj <dig>  aj <dig>  bj <dig> and bj <dig> were transmitted intact  <dig> to 97 % of the time , but evidence for occasional homoeologous recombination events was found for every univalent chromosome . homologous chromosomes in the a, b and c genomes with no pre-existing duplications or rearrangements  showed allele segregation indicative of normal homologous recombination with their homologue  <dig> to 100 % of the time . the highest degree of homoeologous recombination  was detected between chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig>  between a <dig> and c <dig> and between a <dig> and c <dig> .table  <dig> summary of homologous and homoeologous chromosome pairing in the brassica a and c genomes of a near allo-hexaploid hybrid from assessment of recombination breakpoints in  <dig> microspore-derived progeny

dna content of md progeny as estimated by flow cytometry
dna ploidy levels in the md population were inferred from relative dna content, and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  of the expected dna content for a 2n = aabbcc =  <dig> allohexaploid . md progeny with consistent ploidy results fell into two groups: putatively doubled chromosome number    <dig> – <dig>  and undoubled chromosome number   . of the  <dig> md progeny which were sampled 2– <dig> times,  <dig> progeny had > 40 % variation between readings, suggestive of chimeric tissue  . the percentage variation between the maximum and minimum readings for each of the b. rapa, b. napus and b. carinata samples was 2–4 % . however, while some md, sp and op plants fell into the 0–5 % variation range, variation within the 5–37 % range was also observed for some plants and in the near-allohexaploid hybrid controls .fig.  <dig> dna ploidy level as estimated by flow cytometry in three populations derived from microspore culture, self-pollination and open-pollination of the same trigenomic hexaploid hybrid resulting from the cross  × b. juncea. only progeny with consistent dna content between multiple samples are shown. the genetics society of america has granted permission for re-publication of the data from the self-pollinated population for the purposes of comparison: original data published in mason et al.  <cit> 



correlations of chromosome transmission with fertility and ploidy in the md progeny
as described above, the near-allohexaploid hybrid contained univalent chromosomes for a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  of these, only the presence of chromosome a <dig> was positively correlated with higher self-pollinated seed set  and pollen viability  . inheritance of parent alleles located on bivalent chromosomes was not significantly associated with fertility  or ploidy increase across the population using a mixed linear modelling approach after multiple testing corrections. suggestive correlations  were found between self-pollinated seed set and marker alleles on the bottom of chromosome a <dig>  top of a <dig> and top of a3; between pollen viability and the top of chromosome c <dig>  bottom of c <dig>  a <dig> and b <dig> and between ploidy status and markers mid-c <dig>  mid-c <dig>  mid-a <dig> and mid-c <dig> 

contrasting fertility of md, sp and op progeny
we investigated whether microspore culture yielded progeny with different fertility than self-pollinated  or open-pollinated  progeny. average seed production per md individual was  <dig>  which was significantly lower  than average seed production in sp progeny  and op progeny . of  <dig> md plants,  <dig>  produced no seed at all , including 5/ <dig> “n” md plants. of the “2n” md progeny only 30 %  produced seed, setting 1– <dig> seeds . in comparison 79 % of op plants  and 81 % of sp plants  set at least  <dig> self-pollinated seed.fig.  <dig> self-pollinated seed production in three populations derived from microspore culture, self-pollination and open-pollination of the same trigenomic hexaploid hybrid resulting from the cross  × b. juncea. the genetics society of america has granted permission for re-publication of the data from the self-pollinated population for the purposes of comparison: original data published in mason et al.  <cit> 



pollen viability ranged from  <dig> to 91 % in the md population  with 58 % of the assayed md plants being male-sterile . similar pollen viability ranges were observed in the sp  and op  populations, but only  <dig>  %  and 11 %  of individuals in the sp and op populations respectively were male-sterile . significant correlations  between pollen viability and seed set were present across all individuals and within each of the three populations . fertility as measured by either pollen viability or seed set was not significantly associated with dna ploidy level in any population , with the exception of a weakly significant association  between ploidy and pollen viability in the md population.fig.  <dig> pollen viability estimates in three populations derived from microspore culture, self-pollination and open-pollination of the same trigenomic hexaploid hybrid resulting from the cross  × b. juncea. the genetics society of america has granted permission for re-publication of the data from the self-pollinated population for the purposes of comparison: original data published in mason et al.  <cit> 



discussion
by tracking snp allele inheritance along individual chromatids in the md population, we could identify chromosome rearrangements and predict the frequency of homologous and non-homologous recombination events during meiosis in the near-allohexaploid hybrid. although a low level of non-homologous recombination between each of the a, b and c genomes was identified, aj-an, bj-bc and cn-cc homologous chromosomes recombined and segregated with high fidelity in the near-allohexaploid hybrid, with mostly regular allele transmission and minimal non-homologous interactions. examples of irregular meiosis were almost entirely related to illegitimate pairing between homoeologues, but occasionally due to putative univalent inheritance or interactions between other non-homologous chromosome regions. the majority of non-homologous associations were predicted to involve both pre-existing translocation events and univalent chromosomes. use of an md population allowed clear, detailed inferences about crossover frequency and gamete production in the trigenomic hybrid.

recently, significant progress has been made in the brassica model in determining how crossover formation during meiosis is regulated, and what role this plays in subsequent chromosome rearrangements and meiotic stability  <cit> . at least two different but complementary gene pathways are responsible for regulating the location and frequency of crossover formation and resolution during meiosis  <cit> . however, it appears that crossover frequency is at least in part regulated by cell chromosome number: the number of crossovers observed in series of hybrids and haploids is known to increase with increasing numbers of univalent chromosomes  <cit> . recent work has also shown that retention or loss of particular individual chromosomes, such as c <dig>  can also affect crossover frequency  <cit> . our results suggest that crossover frequency was higher per chromatid in the c genome of the b. napus × b. carinata ccab hybrid  than in the allohexaploid hybrid  and in synthetic b. napus . this confirms previous speculation regarding increased crossover frequency in diploid genomes in this and similar hybrid types containing high numbers of additional univalent chromosomes  <cit>  and matches observations in allotriploid  hybrids relative to diploids  and allotetraploids   <cit> . in addition, the higher frequency of recombination in the c genome  compared to the a and b genomes  in the near-allohexaploid hybrid  may suggest that increased sequence similarity between cn/c chromatids resulting from the previous cn-cc recombination events facilitates crossover formation, relative to more distinct chromatids in unrecombined bj-bc and aj-an chromosome pairs.

bias towards inheritance of univalent chromosomes appeared to be regulated somewhat differently than bias towards inheritance of alleles from homologous chromosome pairs. in this study, several univalent chromosomes showed strong bias towards retention or loss in the population, although few strong effects were observed for chromosomes present as homologous pairs. in particular, bj <dig> was preferentially lost, whereas aj <dig> and bj <dig> were preferentially retained , putatively through selective pressure for or against particular alleles present on those chromosomes. this is not entirely expected due to the high degree of genomic redundancy offered by the presence of three related genomes in these hybrids, but could be related to disruptions to gene dosage balance rather than to absolute loss or gain of effect  <cit> . interestingly, although there was no bias towards retention or loss of chromosome aj <dig> in the md population, presence of this chromosome was positively associated with both seed set and pollen viability . no other univalent chromosome had an effect on fertility, despite the extreme bias towards inheritance of some chromosomes, suggesting that some chromosomes or chromosomal loci may be more important for somatic viability but not fertility and vice versa. although b genome inheritance was not assessed in the self-pollinated population analysed previously  <cit> , bias towards inheritance of chromosome aj <dig> was common to both populations. hence, aj <dig> may contain genetic factors related to hybrid embryo viability.

the a7-c <dig> translocation is a known feature of many b. napus genotypes  <cit> , and so it was not surprising to observe this in the b. napus cross parent of our study . the presence of a large scale duplication of loci on chromosome a <dig> was also observed in this b. napus parent . we were unable to identify a deleted genomic region in the c genome corresponding to this duplication, but possibly a region of homoeologue c <dig> was deleted. an approximately  <dig> mbp duplication of part of chromosome c <dig> was also detected and determined to have arisen from a non-reciprocal translocation with a <dig>  probably during meiosis in the b. napus × b. carinata hybrid. interestingly, the two pre-existing genomic features in b. napus  were responsible for the vast majority of homologous pairing disruption observed in our study, similarly to the sister population derived from self-pollination events  <cit> . the genomic architecture of b. juncea, b. carinata and b. napus appears to be otherwise remarkably conserved , considering the widely spaced timing of the independent speciation events which gave rise to each allotetraploid species  <cit> .

on average, md progeny fertility was much lower than that of the sp and op populations , despite the fact that most md progeny had doubled chromosome number during microspore culture . this may suggest that non-viable chromosome rearrangement events have been fixed in the sterile plants, or that accumulation of more duplication and deletion events present in two copies rather than one is more likely to result in disruption of alleles related to fertility  <cit> . however, this effect may also be partially attributable to the additional stress exerted on this material by the microspore culture process. at least  <dig> of the md plants were chimeric, containing sectors of doubled and undoubled tissue . while this is not unexpected in brassica progeny derived from microspore culture  <cit> , a high level of variation between readings was observed in most higher-ploidy md progeny, but not in established species controls . furthermore, deviations from the expected two copies of chromosome pairs were observed in many putatively “2n” md progeny , and cannot be explained by any known meiotic mechanism. a likely source of these anomalies is mitotic instability that may have occurred either as a result of the hybrid status of these progeny, response to colchicine treatment or to the microspore culture processes, or a combination of these factors. this finding may inspire further investigations of the mechanisms governing mitotic instability in microspore culture, an important tool in brassica breeding and genetics research.

assessment of meiotic behaviour was greatly assisted in this study by the availability of a population of microspore-derived progeny, which sampled individual male gametes from the near-allohexaploid hybrid. such technology is currently available in few plant species. however, as next-generation sequencing techniques advance, single-cell sequencing may allow gametes  to be isolated and sequenced directly without the medium of microspore culture to develop embryos and plants, broadening the species applicability of this analysis approach. high-throughput molecular karyotyping approaches are being increasingly available to answer biological questions. the use of snp chip arrays may rapidly become superseded by genotyping-by-sequencing  <cit> . however, the analytical power provided by the snp chip arrays over other molecular marker types, combined with developed pipelines for data analysis  <cit>  have allowed us to determine meiotic behaviour in this allohexaploid rapidly and effectively.

CONCLUSIONS
snp marker segregation patterns in the microspore-derived  population, each of which result from single male meiosis in a near-allohexaploid brassica f <dig> hybrid, allowed us to infer detailed meiotic behaviour in this hybrid. crossover frequencies per chromosome in the allohexaploid were determined to be similar to frequencies expected in established brassica species, suggesting that higher chromosome numbers are not disruptive to cellular regulation of crossover events. the md population was found to have lower average fertility and highly variable dna ploidy levels compared to sp and op populations grown under the same experimental conditions  <cit> . production of a new, stable and fertile allohexaploid brassica crop species through genomic breeding, bringing together all the genetic diversity of the cultivated brassica species and concentrating allelic heterosis, offers a pathway of significant interest for crop geneticists.
