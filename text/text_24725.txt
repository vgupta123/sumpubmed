BACKGROUND
the 5-ht <dig> receptor is a pentameric neurotransmitter gated ion channel that acts as a molecular switch at synapses  <cit> . 5-ht <dig> receptor antagonists are used clinically for the prevention of emesis, and may be useful in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and alcoholism  <cit> . interestingly, mice lacking the 5-ht3a receptor subunit were recently shown to possess an anxiolytic phenotype  <cit> , although therapeutic potential in humans appears limited  <cit> .

five 5-ht <dig> receptor subunits have been cloned to date  <cit> , although only two  have been shown to exist in functional receptors. homomeric 5-ht3a receptors are notable for their sub-ps single channel conductance  <cit> , but co-expression with 5-ht3b receptor subunits increases the conductance to more than  <dig> ps  <cit> . the pharmacological properties of the heteropentamer are largely unchanged compared with the homopentamer  <cit> , although the ca2+ permeability of the heteropentamer may be ablated  <cit>  and recovery from desensitization quickened  <cit> . additionally, rodent 5-ht3a/b heteromers have reduced sensitivity to picrotoxin  <cit> , and channel gating enhancement by some anaesthetics  is markedly attenuated  <cit> . the stoichiometry of recombinant 5-ht3a/b heteropentamers has recently been determined as bbaba  <cit>  but the stoichiometry of native 5-ht <dig> receptors remains to be confirmed.

while expression of 5-ht3b receptor subunits has been demonstrated in the peripheral nervous system  <cit> , controversy remains over their presence in the central nervous system   <cit> . in particular, an antiserum previously generated which recognizes 5-ht3b receptor subunits  labelled cells in the rat hippocampus, despite in situ hybridisation and rt-pcr data suggesting absence of the subunit  <cit> ). on the other hand, 5-ht <dig> receptor expression in the brain is widespread  <cit>  and 5-ht3b receptor subunit mrna has been detected in whole brain lysates  <cit> . it is possible that the 5-ht3b receptor subunit, if expressed in the brain, could be targeted to small, discrete populations of cells. the availability of sensitive and selective antisera could help to clarify these points.

here we describe the generation, purification and characterization of polyclonal antibodies  to a peptide corresponding to a region of the extracellular domain of the 5-ht3b receptor subunit.

RESULTS
immunoreactivity of antisera for 5-ht3b receptor subunits
two rabbits  were immunised with coupled peptide every two weeks for a period of approximately two months. test-bleeds were taken 7– <dig> days after immunisations. western blots were used to test each antiserum by probing membranes electroblotted with separated crude lysates of human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells stably expressing the human 5-ht3b receptor subunit . no consistent immunoreactivity was observed for sera from rabbit  <dig> or pre-immune serum from either animal. at week  <dig> and subsequent bleeds, serum from rabbit  <dig> showed a consistent strong immunoreactivity for a 55– <dig> kda protein. the predicted molecular weight of human 5-ht3b receptor subunits without post-translational modifications is  <dig>  kda. we inferred that this immunoreactivity represented labelling of the 5-ht3b receptor subunit.

serum  <dig> was tested at several different dilutions against homogenates of hek <dig> cells stably expressing 5-ht <dig> receptor subunits. western blots revealed non-specific labelling of several bands at a dilution of 1: <dig> of  <dig> serum , but dilutions of 1: <dig>  to 1: <dig>  labelled a single protein band at 55– <dig> kda from lysates of cells expressing either human or mouse 5-ht3b receptorsubunits . no labelling was seen with lysates of untransfected cells, with cells expressing 5-ht3a receptor subunits, or following pre-incubation of  <dig> serum for  <dig> min with  <dig> mg/ml of the synthetic peptide .

purified igg fraction  was tested by western blot for its ability to recognise 5-ht3b receptor subunit protein as above. purified igg was compared with crude  <dig> serum by applying each solution separately as the primary antibody  to nitrocellulose membranes blotted with lysates of hek <dig> cells expressing 5-ht3a or 5-ht3b receptor subunits, untransfected cells, and lysates of n1e- <dig> cells . in common with the crude serum, pab <dig> did not label proteins from untransfected cells or those expressing 5-ht3a receptor subunits. pab <dig> igg was shown to retain its capacity to specifically label a 55– <dig> kda protein in cells expressing human 5-ht3b receptor subunits, with a substantial decrease in non-specific background labelling.

we infer that the pab <dig> antibodies are both specific and sensitive for 5-ht3b receptor subunits. the previously reported 5-ht3b specific antiserum, ap86/ <dig>  <cit> , detected a band of 50– <dig> kda at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml. our new antiserum appears equally or perhaps more sensitive: we observed labelling at dilutions of 1:  <dig>  crude sera , with strong bands using 1: <dig> pab <dig> . this latter allowed detection of 5-ht3b receptor subunits in homogenates of n1e- <dig> cells, which express heteromeric rodent 5-ht <dig> receptors  <cit> . here pab <dig> recognised a 55– <dig> kda protein, corresponding to the 5-ht3b receptor subunit.

visualisation of 5-ht3b receptor subunits by indirect immunofluorescence
hek <dig> cells were transiently transfected with 5-ht3a or 5-ht3b receptor subunits alone or in combination, and labelled with either pre-immune serum or final bleed polyclonal serum from rabbit  <dig>  typical data is shown in figure  <dig>  no labelling was observed with pre-immune serum from rabbit  <dig> . strong labelling was obtained from permeabilized cells expressing either 5-ht3b receptor subunits alone  or in combination with 5-ht3a receptor subunits . labelling was also seen around the cell membrane of some non-permeabilised cells transfected with both 5-ht3a and 5-ht3b receptor subunits . this suggests that at least some 5-ht3b receptor subunits are expressed on the surface in the presence of 5-ht3a receptor subunits, although the majority of the 5-ht3b receptor subunits remain intracellular. the presence of 5-ht3a receptor subunits on the surface of cells transfected with both 5-ht3a and 5-ht3b receptor subunits was verified by labelling with pab <dig>  an antisera selective for 5-ht3a receptor subunits  <cit>  .

the extracellular location of the antisera binding site means that it can be used to probe the location of 5-ht3b receptor subunits on the cell membrane. both  <dig> serum and pab <dig> igg were found to produce specific labelling of human 5-ht3b receptor subunits expressed in permeabilised hek <dig> cells, with low background labelling. specific labelling of non-permeabilised cells, however, was only seen in the presence of 5-ht3a receptor subunits , suggesting that these are required for efficient expression of 5-ht3b receptor subunits on the surface. thus our immunofluorescence data concur with previous reports that 5-ht3b receptor subunits remain intracellular unless co-expressed with 5-ht3a  <cit> .

as the peptide used to generate the polyclonal antibodies corresponds to part of the n-terminal region of the 5-ht3b receptor subunit, it corresponds to part of the extracellular domain. using the recently published structure of the homologous nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  <cit> , we can identify the likely region to which it binds . the peptide used as an immunogen in this study corresponds to the α-helix at the tip of the extracellular domain. this model also reveals why pab <dig> may be more sensitive than ap86/ <dig> in non-denaturing immunostaining experiments, as the region against which the latter was raised appears to be partly buried in the folded subunit.

immunohistochemical localisation of 5-ht3b subunits in rat brain
the immunogenic peptide from human 5-ht3b receptor subunits used in this study is 58% identical to the mouse 5-ht3b sequence in that region, and for 89% of the residues the charge and polarity are conserved. the sequences of the cloned 5-ht3b receptor subunits from mouse and rat in the region of the peptide used in this study are identical  <cit> . western blots of hek <dig> cells transfected with mouse 5-ht3b receptor subunits or mouse brain  homogenates  showed that the polyclonal antibodies specifically labelled a band of approximately 55– <dig> kda corresponding to 5-ht3b receptor subunits. a further band, of mr approximately  <dig> kda was detected by pab <dig> in mouse brain or n1e- <dig> cell homogenates. an extra  <dig> kda band has previously been observed with polyclonal antibodies raised against the 5-ht3a receptor subunit, and considered to represent a degradation product  <cit> , although differing glycosylation state or a splice variant are also possibilities.

the antibodies were used in further immunohistochemical experiments to determine the distribution of 5-ht3b receptor subunits in rat brain and thereby expand the mapping of 5-ht3a receptors previously described  <cit> . sections of rat hippocampus were probed with either final bleed serum from rabbit  <dig> or pab <dig>  and the optimal dilution was determined to be 1: <dig> –1: <dig> . the pattern of labelling was not significantly different between crude  <dig> serum and purified pab <dig>  the data show a general light labelling of neurons plus a stronger staining of certain cells in the pyramidal and molecular layers of the hippocampus .

similar results were obtained with pab <dig> in rat hippocampus as were previously demonstrated for the 5-ht3a specific antibody, pab <dig>  generated in a previous study  <cit> , except that no axonal labelling was seen with pab <dig>  the lack of axonal labelling by pab <dig> could reflect a difference in the sub-cellular distribution of the subunits, although further experiments are required to confirm this. in situ hybridisation using riboprobes has revealed that different cell types in the rat spinal cord can express different combinations of 5-ht <dig> receptor subunits. 70% of cells in the rat spinal cord express 5-ht3a receptor subunits, but only 50% of those express 5-ht3b receptor subunits, while 91% of neurons that express 5-ht3b receptor subunits also express 5-ht3a  <cit> . additionally, it has been shown that differentiation of rat pc- <dig> cells induced by ngf increases 5-ht3b receptor subunit expression  <cit> . our data, and that utilizing ap86/ <dig> serum  <cit> , which also produced labelling of rat hippocampal sections, support the presence of 5-ht3b receptor subunits on certain cns neurons, and suggests that 5-ht3b receptor subunits are present at low concentrations and are highly localised in discrete populations. the presence of the 5-ht3b receptor subunit in the cns may in fact be neuroprotective, as heteropentameric 5-ht <dig> receptors have a very low ca2+ permeability relative to homopentameric 5-ht3a receptors, which precludes the possibility of ca2+-induced neurotoxicity in the cns being due to 5-ht3a/b heteropentameric receptors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
polyclonal antiserum raised against the peptide, 27pqdsalyhlskqllqkyhk46c, was shown to specifically bind 5-ht3b receptor subunits with high affinity, allowing the labelling of human and rodent 5-ht3b receptor subunit protein in western blot, immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical procedures. it was found that the majority of 5-ht3b receptor subunits, when expressed alone, do not reach the cell surface, but that co-expression of 5-ht3a with 5-ht3b receptor subunits permits expression of 5-ht3b receptor subunits in the plasma membrane, as reported previously  <cit> . receptor subunits were observed in rat hippocampal slices, but only in a small percentage of cells, suggesting they exist in the cns in low abundance and may be highly localised. this new pab <dig> antiserum should help to clarify the location and function of both native and recombinant 5-ht3b receptor subunits.
