BACKGROUND
regulatory t cells  are a subpopulation of t cells that are thought to be derived from the same lineage as naïve cd <dig> cells due to the same expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit> . in addition, tregs express the biomarker forkhead box p <dig>  transcription factor  <cit> . it has been reported that tgf-β is essential for tregs to differentiate from naïve cd <dig> cells and is important in maintaining treg homeostasis  <cit> . tregs can be divided into two subsets: naturally occurring or thymus-derived treg  cells and t regulatory type  <dig> cells. tregs play an important role in autoimmune diseases, cancer, and organ transplantation .

tregs are the front-runners in the race for therapeutic immune-regulation due to their ability to suppress effector t cells, which are known to play an important role in preventing autoimmunity  <cit> . in recent years, it has been reported that ntregs can also effectively prevent the rejection of transplanted allografts in experimental models  <cit> . naturally, ntregs were used in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to inhibit graft-versus-host disease   <cit> . however, the widespread clinical use of tregs has been limited by the low number of these cells in the periphery and immune homeostas  <cit> . therefore, there is a great need for understanding the mechanism of proliferation and immune homeostasis in ntregs to prevent the rejection of transplanted allografts.

interleukin- <dig>  is a hematopoietic growth factor that plays a critical role in regulating the homeostasis of t cells  <cit> . the control of il- <dig> signaling is mainly dependent on the il- <dig> receptor , which is a heterodimer that consists of the il- <dig> receptor alpha  and common gamma chain receptor  <cit> . therefore, cd <dig> plays a key role in modulating the homeostasis of t-cells. however, the molecular mechanism by which cd <dig> controls treg cell proliferation and homeostasis remains unknown.

forkhead box protein o <dig>  is a transcription factor and is characterized by a distinct fork head domain. it was shown that foxo1-deficient mice developed a fatal inflammatory disorder  <cit> . indeed, a growing body of research suggests that foxo <dig> plays an important role in the immune system, including peripheral t-cell homeostasis  <cit> . foxo <dig> can modulate the expression of il-7rα, which is expressed in t-cells  <cit> . furthermore, foxo <dig> can regulate the expression of aven  <cit> , which is an adaptor protein that has been implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling  <cit> . therefore, we speculated that foxo <dig> modulates treg cell homeostasis and functions via cd <dig> and aven.

in the present study, we found that foxo <dig> over-expression resulted in treg cell proliferation by activating il-7/cd <dig> signaling. in addition, foxo <dig> over-expression suppressed treg cell apoptosis by regulating aven expression. taken together, these data suggest that foxo <dig> is required for treg cell proliferation and apoptosis by controlling cd <dig> and aven expression.

RESULTS
foxo <dig> regulates cd <dig> expression in treg cells
to investigate the role of foxo <dig> on il-7rα expression in treg cells, treg cells were transfected with foxo <dig> sirna or control sirna. we found that foxo <dig> mrna expression decreased by more than 50% when using foxo <dig> sirna compared to control sirna . consistent with these findings, foxo <dig> protein expression was downregulated in treg cells that were treated with foxo <dig> sirna compared with control sirna . unexpectedly, cd <dig> protein expression was downregulated in treg cells-treated with foxo <dig> sirna compared with control sirna . conversely, foxo <dig> over-expression increased the expression of cd <dig> in treg cells , which suggested that foxo <dig> plays an important role in cd <dig> expression.fig.  <dig> detection of foxo <dig> and cd <dig> after knockdown and over-expression of foxo <dig> in treg cells. a expression of mrna and protein of foxo <dig> and cd <dig> in treg cells, 48 h after transfection with foxo <dig> sirna. b expression of mrna and protein of foxo <dig> and cd <dig> in treg cells 48 h after transfection with over-expression plasmid of foxo <dig>  treg cells stimulated with anti-cd <dig>  and anti-cd <dig>  in medium during culture. data are presented as the mean + standard deviation . *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig>

foxo <dig> controls treg cell proliferation by regulating cd <dig> expression
to test the role of foxo <dig> in activating treg cells, we detected cd <dig> and inducible co-stimulatory molecule  by fcm, they have been described to identify activated treg cells  <cit> . cd <dig> was also detected by fcm in treg cells. we found that cd <dig>  cd <dig> and icos showed little change in treg cells treated with foxo <dig> sirna and control sirna, and the median fluorescence intensity  of cd <dig> showed no significant difference between foxo <dig> sirna-treated cells and control sirna cells . however, cd <dig>  cd <dig> and icos expression was significantly increased in foxo <dig> over-expression treg cells, and the mfi of cd <dig> in foxo <dig> over-expressed cells was  <dig>  times higher than control . cd <dig> and foxp <dig> showed little change in treg cells in both foxo <dig> knockdown and over-expressed cells . in addition, intracellular signaling molecules associated with the activity of treg cells, including p-erk1/ <dig>  p-akt, p-foxo <dig> and p-stat <dig>  demonstrated no change . these findings suggested that treg cells can be activated by over-expression foxo <dig>  cytokines that affect treg cell activities, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> , were detected using quantitative pcr. however, at the mrna level of the genes, there were no differences when foxo <dig> was over-expressed and knocked down .

next, treg cells were stimulated with cd <dig>  cd <dig> and il- <dig> to activate cell proliferation, and the cell proliferation rate was detected using elisa. we found that the cell proliferation rate was higher in the foxo <dig> over-expression cells than in the foxo <dig> sirna cells . but the cell proliferation rate decreased following treatment with the anti-cd <dig> antibody in the foxo <dig> over-expression cells . similarly, treg cells were incubated without il- <dig>  the cell proliferation rate decreased , which suggested that foxo <dig> controls treg cell proliferation by regulating il-7/cd <dig> signaling.fig.  <dig> proliferation and apoptosis after knockdown or over-expression of foxo <dig> in treg cells. a treg cells growth were measured for 6 days using a mtt assay. treg cells of every group  except foxo1-plasmid  was stimulated with anti-cd <dig> , anti-cd <dig>  and il- <dig>  during culture, and anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> was only added in the foxo1-plasmid  group. in addition, anti-cd <dig>  was added to the foxo1-plasmid + cd <dig> group. these results are presented as the mean ± s.d. of the values obtained in three independent experiments. b representative result of apoptosis in treg cells based on the above groups 48 h after stimulation




foxo <dig> controls treg cell apoptosis by regulating aven expression
treg cells were transfected with foxo1-plasmid prior to incubation with cd <dig>  cd <dig> and il- <dig>  and apoptosis was measured according to the instructions of the pi-annexin v apoptosis detection kit. we found that foxo <dig> over-expression inhibited apoptosis . conversely, cell apoptosis was enhanced in treg cells after transfection with foxo <dig> sirna . however, il- <dig> or cd <dig> demonstrated no apoptotic role in the presence of foxo <dig> , suggesting that foxo <dig> inhibits treg cell apoptosis via other signaling pathways. in view of the opinion that foxo <dig> may regulate the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein aven  <cit> , we tested the hypothesis that foxo <dig> inhibits treg cell apoptosis by regulating aven expression. we first observed that foxo <dig> can bind to the promoter of aven as assessed by the chip assay . furthermore, we found that aven mrna expression was inhibited in treg cells treated with foxo <dig> sirna compared with control . conversely, foxo <dig> over-expression increased the mrna levels of aven in treg cells . consistent with these findings, the protein expression of aven showed the same trend at the mrna level . this finding indicated that foxo <dig> regulates aven expression. the il-7/cd <dig> axis is important for t-cell homeostasis, which can be also mediated by bcl <dig>  we detected the mrna and protein levels of bcl <dig> when aven was over-expressed and knocked down, whereas at the mrna and protein levels, there were no differences between the conditions . bcl <dig> might be not regulated by foxo <dig> fig.  <dig> detection of aven after knockdown and over-expression of foxo <dig> in treg cells. a level of foxo <dig> enrichment at the aven gene promoters in treg cells in which foxo <dig> was knocked down and over-expressed. expression of the  mrna and  protein of foxo <dig> and aven in treg cells 48 h after transfection with foxo <dig> sirna and over-expression. expression of the  protein and  mrna of bcl <dig> in treg cells 48 h after transfection with foxo <dig> sirna and over-expression. cells was stimulated with anti-cd <dig> , anti-cd <dig>  and il- <dig>  during culture. data are presented as the mean + standard deviation . *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 




to detect the role of aven in treg cell apoptosis, treg cells were transfected with aven sirna or control sirna. compared to treg cells that were treated with control sirna, aven expression was downregulated in treg cells treated with aven sirna at the mrna and protein levels . the flow cytometry results showed that apoptosis was enhanced in treg cells transfected with aven sirna . when aven was over-expressed in treg cells, we found that aven expression was upregulated at the mrna and protein levels  and that cell apoptosis was attenuated , suggesting that aven has anti-apoptotic properties in treg cells. furthermore, treg cells are mainly divided into two subgroups: ntreg and itreg. we also investigated the apoptosis of itregs with aven over-expression and knockdown. these results indicated that itreg cells were similar with ntreg cells, such that apoptosis in both cell types could be regulated by aven .fig.  <dig> detection of apoptosis after knockdown and over-expression of aven in treg cells. expression of the  mrna and protein of aven in treg cells 48 h after transfection with aven sirna or over-expression plasmid of foxo <dig>  c representative result of apoptosis in ntreg and itreg cells 48 h after transfection with aven sirna or over-expression plasmid of foxo <dig>  treg cells were stimulated with anti-cd <dig>  and anti-cd <dig>  in medium during culture. data are presented as the mean + standard deviation . ***p < <dig> 




discussion
the forkhead box  family genes have important functions in many biological processes in human and mice. the mutations of fox genes caused many human diseases, such as glaucoma, cancer, language disorders and immune diseases  <cit> . foxn <dig>  a member of the fox family, involved in the differentiation and development of human central nervous system  <cit> , and palys important roles for the differentiation and growth of t cell. alterations of foxn <dig> result in the failure of generating mature and functional thymocytes  <cit> .

foxo <dig> was also an important regulatory factor for the differentiation and function of t cells  <cit> . in the present study, we showed that foxo <dig> activated the il-7/cd <dig> signaling pathway, resulting in increased treg proliferation. in addition, foxo <dig> activated aven expression, which plays an important role in cell apoptosis in treg cells, suggesting that foxo <dig> inhibits treg cell apoptosis via aven expression. these results indicated that foxo <dig> plays a key role in controlling treg cell proliferation and apoptosis by regulating cd <dig> and aven expression.

many studies have shown that foxo <dig> plays an important role in t-cell homeostasis  <cit> . foxo <dig> regulates the expression of cd <dig> by binding to the promoter of the cd <dig> gene, and deletion of the foxo <dig> gene can block the expression of cd <dig> in t-cells  <cit> . in this study, we found that foxo <dig> regulates cd <dig> expression in treg cells. this result is consistent with the result obtained in previous reports. activation of the il-7/cd <dig> signaling pathway can promote treg cell proliferation. therefore, foxo <dig> is involved in the regulation of treg cell proliferation by regulating cd <dig> 

in addition, we found that foxo <dig> regulates cell apoptosis in treg cells. however, cd <dig> was confirmed to not be involved in the cell apoptosis in treg cells. therefore, foxo <dig> regulates other molecules to inhibit cell apoptosis. aven is a novel molecule and can bind to the proapoptotic apaf- <dig> protein to prevent the oligomerization of apaf- <dig> in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway  <cit> . recently, it was shown that aven contributes to the anti-apoptotic properties of this protein  <cit> . we found that foxo <dig> can regulate aven expression in treg cells, which inhibits cell apoptosis. these data indicated that foxo <dig> is involved in the regulation of treg cell apoptosis via aven.

in conclusion, we demonstrated that foxo <dig> over-expression in the treg cells results in a significant enhancement of cell proliferation due to the activation of the il-7/cd <dig> signaling pathway. in addition, foxo <dig> over-expression in treg cells inhibits cell apoptosis by regulating aven expression. collectively, foxo <dig> is required for treg cell proliferation and apoptosis via cd <dig> and aven expression.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that foxo <dig> is a positive regulatory factor for ntreg cell activation. it promotes the proliferation of treg cells and inhibits apoptosis via the aven signaling pathway. these data suggest that foxo <dig> might be a promising target for activating ntreg cells in vivo and in vitro. basic and clinical research of treatment drugs provides a useful reference.
