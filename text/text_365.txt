BACKGROUND
lactic acid bacteria  constitute a group of gram-positive, non-sporulating, nutritionally fastidious, and strictly fermentative bacteria that produce lactic acid as the major end product from carbohydrate  <cit> . lactobacillus, which currently holds  <dig> species http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/, is by far the largest and most diverse genus of lab. different species of lactobacilli are important components of the oral cavity as well as the gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts of vertebrates, while others are indigenous to milk, plant material, and meat environments  <cit> . many play important roles in both traditional and commercial-scale food and feed fermentations, or food spoilage.

a few species of lactobacillus show remarkable ecological adaptability and may be recovered from a variety of diverse habitats  <cit> . lactobacillus casei, for example, has been isolated from raw and fermented dairy  and plant materials , as well as the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals  <cit> . as an aside, debate over the taxonomy of l. casei in recent years has led to interchangeable use of l. casei and l. paracasei in the literature. all of the strains included in this study show >99% identity to the 16s rrna sequence of l. casei atcc  <dig>  which is the current type strain for l. paracasei <cit> .

the broad ecological distribution of l. casei reflects a metabolic flexibility that has fueled widespread application of the species in the food and health industries; different strains are employed as acid-producing starter cultures for milk fermentation, as adjunct cultures to accelerate or intensify flavor development in bacterial-ripened cheeses, and as probiotics to enhance human or animal health  <cit> . the food and agriculture organization and the world health organization of the united nations define probiotics as “live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host”  <cit> . strains used as starter cultures or probiotics must, of course, be nonpathogenic to humans even when consumed in very high numbers . thus, the wide ecological distribution of l. casei makes this species a particularly interesting and relevant subject for research on genetic diversity, genome evolution, and lifestyle adaptation.

bacterial genome evolution and adaptation are thought to occur via three major processes: 1) modification of existing genes by mutation with vertical inheritance  <cit> ; 2) acquisition of exogenous genes or gene clusters by bacteria through horizontal gene transfer  that impart a fitness benefit  <cit> ; and 3) deletion or decay of genes that no longer confer a fitness benefit  <cit> . comparative genome analysis of lactobacilli and other lab has shown that all three mechanisms have contributed to the adaptation of these microbes to new habitats and lifestyles, but gene decay and acquisition by hgt appear to be especially dominant forces  <cit> . in l. casei and many other lab, genome evolution is expected to reflect adaptation of the species to dynamic, nutritionally variable and ancient environments, such as the gastrointestinal tract and plant materials, as well as relatively recent expansion into a more constant and nutrient-rich milk-based niche. not surprisingly, comparative genome analysis between l. casei atcc  <dig> and other sequenced lactobacilli confirmed l. casei has features, including a relatively high number of carbohydrate-related genes and is elements  <cit> , which are consistent with a metabolically and genetically versatile lifestyle  <cit> .

the evolutionary history of l. casei has been viewed through its population structure; multi-locus sequence typing  of  <dig> l. casei strains isolated from different niches indicated the species had diverged into three lineages  <cit> . separation of two major clusters occurred approximately  <dig>  million years ago; one large cluster contained strains recovered from human, plant, and dairy sources, while the second and smaller cluster was predominantly comprised of corn silage isolates. in contrast, the third major cluster included  <dig> strains that had been isolated from cheese in the united states, australia, and europe, and was predicted to reflect recent divergence of strains that were highly specialized for this relatively new ecological niche   <cit> . this cluster of cheese specialists was also revealed in a follow up study that explored l. casei genetic diversity by comparative genome hybridization  of  <dig> strains against an atcc  <dig> whole genome microarray  <cit> . that work further suggested that adaptation to the cheese environment had been accompanied by extensive decay of genes involved in carbohydrate utilization and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . metabolic simplification via the loss of genes for carbohydrate metabolism has been associated with adaptation of other lab species to the nutrient-rich milk environment  <cit> . intriguingly, many of the genes that l. casei cheese specialists lacked were associated with genomic islands postulated to function in lifestyle adaptation of other l. casei strains  <cit> .

cgh data for the  <dig> strains as well as comparative genome analysis between strains atcc  <dig> and bl <dig> identified numerous hypervariable regions and genomic islands, respectively, some of which showed an atypical base composition that is commonly associated with gene acquisition by hgt  <cit> . the diversity and distribution of these regions among different strains indicated that: i) there was a large pool of accessory genes in the population; ii) most l. casei strains were likely niche generalists that could exploit a variety of habitats and tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions; and iii) hgt has played a significant role in the evolution, lifestyle adaptation, and metabolic diversity of l. casei <cit> . however, these conclusions were softened by the knowledge that microarray-based cgh analysis cannot identify genes that may be present in the test strain but absent from the reference strain, and because the ecological origin of strain bl <dig> is unclear  <cit> .

in recent years, the availability of multiple genome sequences for a single species has demonstrated that a number of pathogenic bacteria possess an extensive pan-genome or “supragenome” that may be several fold larger than the genome of any single strain  <cit> . this discovery has given rise to the distributed genome hypothesis , which postulates that access to a supragenome through homologous recombination allows individual strains to rapidly shuffle their genetic information and overcome host defense responses  <cit> . although the dgh has been almost exclusively applied to describe genome evolution in pathogens, the circumstances upon which it is founded   <cit>  are widespread in the microbial world. baumdicker et al.  <cit>  recently showed the dgh extended to nonpathogenic bacteria, and it was our hypothesis that a distributed supragenome would drive genome evolution and lifestyle adaptation in an ecologically flexible species such as l. casei.

to test this hypothesis, we collected draft sequences for  <dig> strains that had been isolated from dairy , plant , or human  sources that appear to provide broad representation for the genetic diversity in l. casei <cit> , and performed comparative genome analysis between these strains plus the complete sequences from  <dig> additional l. casei strains  in the public database  <cit> .

RESULTS
l. casei genome features
genome features of the  <dig> l. casei strains included in the study, which provide a broad representation of genetic, ecological, and geographical diversity in the species, are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the  <dig> new draft sequences had a range of coverage between 17x and 133x  and ranged in total contig number from 28– <dig>  . using a set of only three closed genome references , we were able to determine orientation and order the contigs of each draft. the contig numbers listed in table  <dig> were obtained after contigs were ordered and oriented in mauve and the draft was aligned end-to-end based on the advanced order, which reduced the number of contigs obtained from the de novo assembly by an average of 20% . each of the genomes was assembled into scaffolds based on the placed and unplaced contigs from mauve, with the unplaced contigs being ordered by name at the end of the scaffold.

although the final contig order was not independently validated for all  <dig> draft genomes, an optical restriction map  <cit>  was used as a reference to validate assembly of the lpc- <dig> genome by this approach . the overall arrangement of the contig order for lpc- <dig> was done using progressive mauve, and alignment of the contigs to the optical map demonstrates that the method of assembly and ordering yielded a well ordered draft, with only a few major gaps. the optical map gave an estimated genome size of  <dig> , <dig> bp with a total concatenated ordered draft length of  <dig> , <dig> bp . based on the alignment between optical map and draft assembly, the size difference is likely derived from  <dig> major sequence gaps approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and 10kb in size .

the number of predicted cds features in each genome ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an overall gc content of  <dig> - <dig> % . comparative genomics of the resulting architecture revealed synteny was relatively high across the l. casei genomes, with several large blocks of highly conserved gene content across all  <dig> l. casei strains . these data also indicate that genome size differences were not due to major chromosomal insertions, deletions or re-arrangements.

sequence homology was determined even more accurately when strains were aligned based on gene content , so that most of the diversity is observed as indels. as expected, the number of locally collinear blocks  detected using the progressive mauve alignment increased with the number of genomes compared. hierarchical clustering of strains based on overall gene content yielded a dendrogram with  <dig> clusters, designated a-f . when members of each cluster were aligned to each other or to their closest reference genome, the number of lcbs was reduced, and the overall sequence homology detected between the strains was apparent based on the height of the similarity profile within each lcb . no major genomic rearrangements were detected within any of the draft sequences. content conservation was even higher within clusters , most notably for clusters e and f. even within clusters b and c, which contain  <dig> and  <dig> strains, respectively, overall synteny was high with mostly localized polymorphic content .

comparison of the gene content-based dendrogram  to an mlst-based phylogenetic tree for the  <dig> l. casei strains examined in this study  revealed similar clustering for strains in gene content clusters a, e, f, and parts of b and c. however, mlst-derived relationships among the remaining strains did not resemble those derived from overall gene content. the basis for this observation is well understood; mlst-based phylogeny reflects relatively slow genome evolution caused by point mutations and selective pressure, whereas the gene content dendrogram captures more rapid  large-scale insertion and deletion events. thus, variations between gene content- and mlst-based dendrograms are expected in bacterial species like l. casei that display frequent intra-species recombination  <cit> .

characterization of the l. casei core and supragenome
comparative genome analysis between the five complete and  <dig> draft genomes provided new insights to the genetic diversity of l. casei. the l. casei genome encodes an average of  <dig>   orthologous clusters, of which  <dig>  were common to all  <dig> strains analyzed . graphing the numbers of core and total features  as a function of the number of strains sequenced revealed the slope for core gene number was approaching an asymptote, whereas the pan-genome continued to expand even after compilation of  <dig> genomes . overall, differences in l. casei genome inventory reveal an open pan-genome comprised of  <dig>  core and  <dig>  accessory orthologous clusters identified to date, including a large number of unique orthologous clusters in each strain  . extrapolation of these data using the binomial mixture model described by snipen et al.  <cit>  yields an estimated core genome of  <dig>  orthologous clusters and a pan-genome of  <dig>  total orthologous clusters. these findings indicate l. casei has a supragenome that is approximately  <dig>  times larger than the average genome of individual strains, and support the hypothesis that the relative size and content of the pan-genome is an indicator of genetic plasticity and potential for environmental adaptation within a species  <cit> .

strain-specific features of the l. casei supragenome
protein homology searches with strain-specific accessory gene products  revealed 8-87%  of these proteins had highest similarity to gene products found in other strains of l. casei or lactobacillus paracasei . the lowest fractions  were found in the two wine isolates  and three dairy strains . expansion of the analysis to include gene products with greatest homology to proteins from other species of lactobacilli accounted for 45-95%  of the strain-specific accessory genes products. for example, different proteins with very high amino acid identity  to orthologs in the closely related species lactobacillus rhamnosus were found in all l. casei strains except three dairy isolates . additionally, strain-specific accessory genes encoding orthologs with high homology to proteins from a broad range of other lactobacillus species including l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. coryniformis, l. coleohominis, l. farciminis, l. helveticus, l. hilgardii, l. jensenii, l. kefiranofaciens, l. ois, l. pentosus, and l. salivarius were sporadically distributed among the  <dig> l. casei strains examined . many of these lactobacilli are only distantly related to l. casei, but all share at least one ecological niche with this species and theoretically might have contributed to the diversity of the l. casei supragenome. there were, for example, clear relationships between ecological co-localization with particular lactobacillus species and the unique accessory gene content of individual l. casei strains. l. coryniformis, for example, is commonly found in fermented plant material   <cit>  and accessory gene products with very high homology scores to various proteins from this species were found within each of the five silage and wine isolates, but not in any of the human or dairy strains . similarly, l. casei strains of dairy origin had a greater prevalence of accessory genes whose products gave very high homology scores to different proteins from l. fermentum , a species commonly found in milk products  <cit> .

overall, l. casei plant isolates showed the most diverse repertoire of strain-specific accessory genes. genes encoding orthologs with high amino acid identity to different proteins from l. plantarum, l. buchneri, and l. pentosus, for example, were most prevalent in plant isolates, as were proteins with orthologs in distantly related bacteria such as enterococcus, streptococcus, bacillus, and clostridium species . finally, accessory genes with very high homology scores to various proteins from listeria sp. were detected in each of the human l. casei isolates and in the three dairy strains, but not in any of the plant isolates, even though listeria are commonly recovered from vegetation  <cit> .

if niche-associated gene exchange contributes to the composite nature of the l. casei supragenome, and this process is important to l. casei strain evolution and lifestyle adaptation, then one might expect to find evidence of relatively recent events among different strains. indeed, several insertion sequence elements in l. casei strains shared at least 99% nucleotide sequence identity with elements that have been identified in the ge nomes of l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. fermentum, oenococcus oeni and even listeria innocua . more interestingly, l. casei strains ucd <dig>  bd-ii, and uw <dig> each possess a unique polycistronic region encoding features associated with lifestyle adaptation  <cit>  that share very high  nucleotide sequence identity with genomic regions in l. plantarum or l. brevis . only one strain of l. brevis has been sequenced to date, but nucleotide blast searches showed each of the clusters with homology to l. plantarum was common among sequenced strains of that species.

the four-gene cluster found in l. casei uw <dig> is virtually identical to a locus in l. brevis atcc  <dig> that encodes an abc sugar transport system of unknown specificity . tests on subset of nine stains, including uw <dig>  for the ability to grow in cdaa supplemented with one of  <dig> different substrates did not reveal any capability that was unique to strain uw <dig> , so the function of this gene cluster remains unclear. in both species, the cluster is flanked on one side by a gene for transposase , and the g+c content of the cluster  is considerably lower than that of either species' genome  , suggesting the cluster may have been acquired by one or both species from a third donor.

the polycistronic cluster identified in l. casei bd-ii is plasmid borne, and carries five of the six genes that comprise the l. plantarum lar operon  <cit>  . goffin and coworkers  <cit>  showed lar is required for lactate racemization activity in l. plantarum, but the function of most lar-encoded proteins, or even whether all six genes are required for this activity, remains unknown. d-lactate is a component of the cell wall in l. plantarum and l. casei, and goffin et al.  <cit>  suggested lar activity may provide the cell with a rescue pathway for d-lactate production under conditions that inhibit d-lactate dehydrogenase activity. the lar genes of l. casei bd-ii show 98-99% nucleotide sequence identity to their counterparts in l. plantarum, and the bd-ii locus is flanked on each side by transposase genes . there are no transposase genes in the immediate vicinity of the lar operon in l. plantarum. collectively, these observations provide good evidence that the lar locus in l. casei bd-ii was acquired via hgt from l. plantarum, but its role, if any, in lifestyle adaptation must yet be determined.

the third and most compelling example of lifestyle evolution via hgt was found in the wine isolate l. casei ucd <dig>  this bacterium contains a polycistronic cluster for l-tartrate catabolism and malate transport that was previously thought to be one of three defined l. plantarum-specific gene clusters  <cit> . tartaric and malic acids are the primary acids in grapes and therefore the strongest acids in wine. tartrate dehydratase allows cells to convert tartrate to oxaloacetic acid, an important metabolic intermediate, and malate transport and metabolism are known to enhance acid tolerance in l. casei and other lactic acid bacteria  <cit> . thus, acquisition of this cluster by ucd <dig> very likely promoted survival and adaptation of this strain to the acid environment of wine. features of the ucd <dig> tartrate dehydratase cluster, including 99% nucleotide sequence identity over the cluster and associated aroab genes with the corresponding l. plantarum locus, and the presence of flanking transposase genes in ucd <dig> , provide strong evidence that the locus was acquired by hgt from l. plantarum.

finally, we have noted l. rhamnosus might be an important source of genetic diversity in l. casei, but also found evidence that the reverse may be true. of the nine publicly available complete or draft genome sequences for l. rhamnosus, only two strains, gg  and lms2- <dig>  contain a genomic region that encodes three secreted lpxtg-like pilin proteins  plus a dedicated sortase for their export  <cit> . functional genomic studies showed the spacba pilus promotes adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells, and may function to modulate interleukin- <dig> expression that is induced by lipoteichoic acid or other surface molecules  <cit> . while the spacba locus and associated sortase are clearly uncommon among l. rhamnosus strains, it is fully conserved in l. casei strains atcc  <dig>  bl <dig>  zhang, and t <dig>  and present but probably inactive  in l. casei strains 21/ <dig>  m <dig>  crf <dig>  uw <dig>  a2- <dig>  32g, lc- <dig>  and lpc- <dig>  collectively, these strains span the major mlst-defined genetic lineages for l. casei <cit> , which suggests the genes were not recently acquired. the spacba and sortase genes of l. casei atcc  <dig> show 95-99% nucleotide sequence identity to their counterparts in l. rhamnosus, whose locus is also flanked by transposase genes that are virtually identical to elements found in l. casei. there are no transposase genes in the immediate vicinity of the spacba cluster in the l. casei strains sequenced to date. collectively, these observations provide compelling evidence that the spacba locus in l. rhamnosus gg and lms2- <dig> may have originally been acquired via hgt from l. casei.

overall, the composite nature of the l. casei strain-specific accessory gene pool and the presence of gene clusters in some strains that appear to have been recently acquired support our hypothesis that evolution of the l. casei supragenome has been heavily influenced by ecological co-localization with other bacterial species. placed within the greater context of the dgh, we propose that l. casei, and probably other ecologically flexible species, have access to a supragenome whose composition is not exclusive to the species, but instead might be viewed as a subset of the microbial metagenome within a particular niche. while the primary mechanism for supragenome access by l. casei are unknown, natural transformation has never been demonstrated in lactobacilli, and the prevalence of is elements and plasmid-linked traits among genes that appear to have been recently acquired  suggest that conjugation may be a key driver of hgt in l. casei. however, the widespread distribution of phage-related proteins among the l. casei accessory gene pool  suggest transduction could also be an important mechanism for genome evolution in this species.

adaptive immunity against invasive dna
although conjugation and transduction may be important mechanisms for hgt in l. casei, these and other bacteria have also acquired sophisticated mechanisms to combat invasive bacteriophage and plasmid dna. one key example is the crispr-cas adaptive immunity system, which consists of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  adjacent to cas  genes. the crispr loci are comprised of partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of "spacer" dna that are acquired from invasive bacteriophage or plasmid dna. once present, these spacer sequences allow cells to recognize and cleave invasive dna that contains those sequences  <cit> . two distinct types of crispr loci were identified in the l. casei genomes. these two loci are typically characterized by idiosyncratic crispr repeats: 5’-gtctcaggtagatgtcgaatcaatcagttcaagagc-3’ for the type ii-a  locus, and 5’-gttttccccgcacatgcgggggtgatccc-3’ for the type i-e  locus. such repeats have been previously identified in a variety of lactobacilli, including l. salivarius, l. casei and l. rhamnosus for lsal <dig>  and l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, l. acidophilus and l. brevis for ldbu <dig>  <cit> . overall, crispr repeats were highly conserved, with >97% typical repeats across lsal <dig>  and >96% typical repeats for ldbu <dig> .

lsal1-type crispr loci were identified in  <dig> strains, while ldbu1-type loci were identified in  <dig> strains, with both types present in the m <dig> genome . only four strains  did not possess crispr loci. the cas content for the lsal <dig> loci is typical of type ii-a systems  <cit> , with the universal cas <dig> and cas <dig>  in combination with the cas <dig> signature gene. also, a tracrrna homologous to those found in type ii systems  <cit>  was identified in the intergenic region between cas <dig> and cas <dig>  though universal genes were highly conserved, up to 19% nucleotide polymorphism was observed for the cas <dig> signature gene. the genomic location of these loci across the  <dig> strains was consistent, and occurred immediately following lcabl_ <dig> homologs . the cas content for ldbu <dig> is typical of type i-e systems  <cit> , with the universal cas <dig> and cas <dig>  in combination with the cas <dig> signature gene, and cascade-encoding genes, notably cas6e <cit> .

as expected, the spacer content was hypervariable across crispr loci from different strains, with spacer numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> for lsal <dig>  and between  <dig> and  <dig> for ldbu <dig> . of note, identical sets of spacers were conserved across cluster f strains  indicating very close genetic relatedness, which is also reflected in strain clustering based on overall gene content and mlst analysis . several sets of contiguous spacers were also conserved between cluster f strains and strains lc- <dig> and zhang, which suggest common ancestry or hgt inheritance of this crispr locus. in contrast, spacer content showed more typical hypervariability across the other strains, with only  <dig> spacer shared between uw <dig> and ucd <dig> . for ldbu <dig>  however, several sets of contiguous spacers were conserved between the dairy strains lpc- <dig> and m <dig> .

analysis of spacer sequences revealed that numerous spacers show homology to lactobacillus phages  and plasmids  . analysis of sequence conservation in the direct vicinity of proto-spacers that showed similarity or identity to crispr spacers revealed the presence of proto-spacer associated motifs   <cit> , namely, a conserved tgaaa immediately downstream of the lsal <dig> protospacers, and aay immediately upstream of the ldbu <dig> protospacers . the tgaaa pentamer is homologous to the agaaw pam previously identified downstream of protospacers in streptococcus thermophilus type ii systems  <cit> .

overall, crispr locus hypervariability across strains, in terms of occurrence, locus type and spacer content illustrates their functional value in response to environmental pressure, notably in providing resistance against phages. this polymorphism indicates crispr loci are desirable targets for typing of l. casei strains, in disagreement with a previous report  <cit> . the critical role that crispr-cas systems play in resistance to viruses has been documented in dairy cultures  <cit> , as well as environmental samples  <cit> . the occurrence of numerous l. casei crispr spacers with homology to lactobacillus phages  that prey upon closely related species  combined with the larger numbers of spacer sequences in strains isolated from commercial cheese production environments  further underscores the selective pressure against phage infection that exists in industrial dairy manufacturing environments. the propensity of hypervariable crispr loci for hgt  <cit>  is also illustrated within l. casei by the co-occurrence of various is elements for both types of loci , the sharing of contiguous spacer sets across strains that belong to different phylogenetic clusters , and the skewed gc content of cas genes . overall, these results highlight the reliance of l. casei strains on crispr-cas systems to provide immunity against invasive elements, as previously shown in bacteria and archaea  <cit> .

evolution via genome decay
our results and previous studies  <cit>  have indicated hgt is a dominant force in genome evolution of l. casei, but a prior cgh experiment also provided evidence for a genetically distinct and geographically distributed cluster of l. casei cheese specialists whose evolution was accompanied by extensive decay of genes involved in carbohydrate utilization and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by the fact that energy production in l. casei is primarily derived from carbohydrate fermentation, so niche adaptation should be heavily predicated by the ability of strains to utilize available carbohydrate. fermenting plant material, for example, can contain a diverse array of simple and complex carbohydrates as well as sugar alcohols  <cit> , and many of these substrates will also be encountered in the gi tract as a consequence of diet. thus, the ability to utilize c <dig> sugars and certain c <dig> and c <dig> sugar alcohols is more prevalent in l. casei isolated from plant material and the human gi tract than in cheese isolates  <cit> . the overlap in carbohydrate availability and use by l. casei associated with plants or the gastrointestinal tract also supports the hypothesis that many strains from these environments should be viewed as ecological generalists, whereas adaptation to cheese has been accompanied by extensive genome decay that, ultimately, resulted in niche specialization  <cit> .

to explore the role of genome decay in the relationship between niche adaptation and substrate utilization, we tested a subset of nine stains  distributed across the major mlst-defined l. casei lineages  <cit>  for the ability to grow in cdaa supplemented with one of  <dig> different substrates associated with plant, gut, or dairy niches. growth was detected on a total of  <dig> substrates, with individual strains able to utilize as few as  <dig> to as many as  <dig> different substrates . results showed the two cheese specialists uw <dig> and uw <dig>  which share the same mlst lineage , had the most restricted substrate profile with growth on  <dig> and  <dig> different substrates, respectively. each of the other strains was able to utilize at least  <dig> different carbohydrates, while two of the corn silage isolates  each grew on  <dig> substrates, although their profiles were not identical .

the genetic basis for utilization of many of these substrates is unknown, and efforts to detail the impact of genome decay on different substrate profiles is further challenged by the fact that most of l. casei genome sequences used for this study are incomplete. nonetheless, evidence for genome decay in the evolution of the cheese specialist strains uw <dig> and uw <dig> was observed in regard to genes for inulin, sucrose and cellobiose utilization. in l. casei, the ability to ferment sucrose and inulin is encoded by an operon for fructooligosaccharide utilization   <cit>  that is present in the other seven strains tested, which were all sucrose- and inulin-positive, but completely absent in uw <dig> and uw <dig> 

in contrast to the single fos operon, we identified nine distinct gene clusters among the  <dig> l. casei genomes studied here that may function in cellobiose utilization . cellobiose is a disaccharide formed by enzymatic or acid hydrolysis of cellulose that, like sucrose and inulin, may be encountered in plant material or in the human gastrointestinal tract but not in milk or cheese. each of the nine strains analyzed in this part of the study possessed single copies of one  to eight  of these gene clusters , and all but uw <dig> were able to ferment cellobiose . while the function of each cluster in cellobiose utilization  has not been demonstrated, data for strains atcc  <dig> and uw <dig> show at least two of these clusters must enable cellobiose fermentation in l. casei . cross comparison of the distribution of clusters  <dig> to  <dig> across the mlst lineages for the nine l. casei strains tested  provides clear evidence of genome decay; many clusters are entirely absent, presumably due to deletion events, and all but 12a contained at least one cluster that was predicted to be nonfunctional due to frameshift mutations . the single cluster in the cellobiose-negative strain uw <dig>  for example, was predicted to be nonfunctional . finally, examination of all  <dig> genomes included in this study confirmed the cheese specialists uw <dig> and uw <dig> had the fewest total cellobiose clusters, and were the only strains lacking cluster  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in bacteria, the concept of species is traditionally anchored to features that are encoded by the core genome, but which often do not adequately describe the genetic diversity that is characteristic of a particular species  <cit> . thus, there is increasing awareness that a large number of strains, preferably of disparate origin, must be sequenced to gain an accurate understanding of the evolution and biology of a particular bacterial species. to our knowledge, this is the first study to explore genome evolution and diversity in an ecologically flexible lactic acid bacterium using genome sequences from a large number of ecologically divergent strains.

as is depicted in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> l. casei genomes included in the study were not sufficient to capture the full pan-genome of this remarkable species. indeed, mathematical extrapolation of these data indicated only 2/ <dig> of the actual l. casei pan-genome has been sequenced to date . evidence for a much larger, open pan-genome was also provided by hierarchical clustering of strains based on overall gene content, since  <dig> of the  <dig> clusters  currently contain single isolates. overall, our findings indicate l. casei has an open and distributed supragenome that is approximately  <dig>  times larger than the average genome size for individual strains.

characterization of the l. casei supragenome suggested its composition has been influenced by ecological co-localization with other bacterial species, especially lactobacilli. these findings provide additional confirmation that the dgh extends to non-pathogenic species  <cit> , and indicate ecologically flexible bacteria like l. casei have access to a supragenome whose composition might be viewed as a subset of the microbial metagenome within a particular ecological niche. finally, our results also provide support for the hypothesis that hgt has been a dominant force in adaptation of l. casei to new habitats and lifestyles, and that evolution of a genetically distinct and geographically distributed cluster of l. casei cheese specialists has been accompanied by extensive decay of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization  <cit> .
