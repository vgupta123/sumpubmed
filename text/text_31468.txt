BACKGROUND
bananas and plantains  are perennial giant herbs grown in humid tropical and subtropical regions. their annual production exceeds  <dig> million tons, out of which almost 90% is targeted for local and national markets  <cit> . cultivated bananas are parthenocarpic, seed-sterile, vegetatively-propagated diploid, triploid and tetraploid clones. most of them are hybrids between two diploid  species m. acuminata and m. balbisiana  <cit>  with the a and b genomes respectively. the production of bananas is threatened by many diseases and pests, but the clonal nature, seed sterility and the lack of knowledge on the origin of cultivated clones hampers breeding of improved cultivars. it is expected that the use of molecular tools will speed up banana germplasm improvement. sadly, although the socio-economic importance of bananas and plantains cannot be questioned, musa remains outside the focus of major research programs and must be considered an under-researched crop.

this situation is reflected by a limited knowledge of the banana nuclear genome, even though it is relatively small   <cit> . it has been estimated that about 55% of the genome is made of various dna repeats  <cit> , but only a limited number of repetitive dna sequences has been characterized. valárik et al.  described twelve radka repeats  <cit> , representing partial sequences of various mobile elements and rrna genes. other characterized sequences included a copia-like element  <cit> , a species-specific element brep- <dig>  <cit>  and a ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposon monkey  <cit> . in order to identify more repeats, hřibová et al.  <cit>  applied a low-cot dna isolation technique to characterize highly repetitive fractions of banana genome. an important step forward in dissecting the musa genome was made by cheung and town , who sequenced ends of more than  <dig>  bac  clones  <cit> . moreover,  <dig> bac clones were completely sequenced through a generation challenge programme funded project , within the context of the global musa genomics consortium  <cit> . nevertheless, even after these efforts, the knowledge on the repetitive part of musa genome remains far from complete.

recent introduction of the next generation sequencing methods  <cit>  provided powerful tools to discover and characterize dna repeats, even in complex plant genomes. for example, macas et al.  used the  <dig> technology to characterize repetitive dna in the nuclear genome of pea   <cit> . despite the relatively small proportion of sequenced dna relative to the whole genome , the authors identified and characterized most types of retrotransposons and discovered thirteen new families of tandemly organized repeats. in a similar study, swaminathan et al.  used the  <dig> system to sequence  <dig> % of the soybean genome  <cit> .

this study addresses the lack of knowledge on the repetitive part of the banana genome by characterizing all major dna repeats after massively parallel sequencing of genomic dna of a diploid clone of m. acuminata. the experimental approach follows that of macas et al.  <cit> , in which all-to-all similarity comparison of  <dig> reads is performed to identify groups  of overlapping reads representing repetitive genomic sequences. as the number of reads in individual clusters is proportional to genomic abundance of corresponding repeats, this information can be used for quantitative analysis of repetitive genome landscape. in addition, consensus sequences of the repeated elements can be obtained by assembling the reads within clusters. we also demonstrate how databases of  <dig> reads sorted according to the type of repeats can be used to identify and classify repeats in bac sequences. finally, the large set of sequences obtained in this study provides a unique source of molecular markers potentially useful in genome mapping, anchoring physical maps, analyzing genetic diversity and for phylogenetic studies.

RESULTS
a diploid clone m. acuminata cv. 'calcutta 4' was chosen for sequencing as it has been used extensively as a model genotype in previous molecular studies  <cit> . moreover, this clone is being used in various banana breeding programs as a source of diseases resistance  <cit> . a sequencing run of nuclear dna on the gs flx platform  resulted in  <dig>  reads with average length of  <dig> bp, providing a total of  <dig> , <dig> bp of sequence data. considering genome size of 'calcutta 4'   <cit> , this represents  <dig> % of the genome. the sequencing reads were clustered based on their similarity and all clusters containing at least  <dig> reads  were further investigated.

ltr-retrotransposons
the most abundant dna sequences found in the banana genome were ltr-retrotransposons. out of them, ty1/copia represented more than 16% of the genome while the ty3/gypsy elements represented about 7% of the genome . this is an interesting observation as the available data from other sequencing projects indicate prevalence of ty3/gypsy retrotransposons in plant nuclear genomes  <cit> . in order to get insight into the diversity of banana ltr-retrotransposons, we performed phylogenetic analysis based on a comparison of their reverse transcriptase domains. this work revealed that while the more abundant ty1/copia-like elements were represented by four distinct evolutionary lineages , vast majority of ty3/gypsy-like elements belonged to a single evolutionary lineage of chromoviruses  <cit>  .

about 74% of identified ty1/copia sequences belonged to the sire/maximus lineage  <cit> , representing almost 13% of the genome. the remaining ty1/copia elements belonging to angela, tnt <dig> and hopscotch lineages  <cit>  represented only about  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the genome, respectively. interestingly, fluorescence in situ hybridization  on mitotic chromosomes revealed that elements from distinct evolutionary lineages have different patterns of genomic distribution. the elements from the sire/maximus and angela lineages were concentrated in several discrete clusters on all chromosomes  and the elements from the tnt- <dig> lineage gave only weak signals preferentially localized in distal parts of mitotic chromosomes . elements belonging to the hopscotch lineage were not tested for the distribution because of their very low proportion in the genome.

ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons showed relatively low degree of phylogenetic diversity and most of them belonged to the lineage of chromoviruses. this single lineage comprised about 87% of ty3/gypsy elements identified in this study, thus greatly outnumbering elements from the tat lineage, which included all other ty3/gypsy elements identified in the banana genome. the chromoviral sequences could be classified into four clades: galadriel, tekay, reina and crm  <cit> . the most abundant chromoviral clade was reina, which involved more than half of all chromoviral sequences, making up about 4% of the banana genome. many elements belonging to this clade appeared to be non-autonomous as they lacked parts of rt-coding domain . members of the tekay clade were found to be the second most abundant group of chromoviruses, reaching about 2% of the genome. sequences from the galadriel clade corresponded to the retrotransposon monkey, which has been identified earlier in the banana genome  <cit> . the consensus sequences of the monkey retrotransposon assembled from our  <dig> data as a  <dig> bp fragment showed 95% similarity to the monkey element described by balint-kurti et al.   <cit> . previous estimates of the copy number using slot-blot analysis indicated that monkey constituted about  <dig>  -  <dig> % of the m. acuminata genome  <cit>  and are on line with our estimates based on the proportion of monkey-derived sequences in  <dig> reads . although the monkey was supposed to be the most abundant repetitive element in banana  <cit> , our data showed that several other families of retroelements account for much larger parts of the genome. the crm clade sequences occupied a similar fraction of the genome as those from the galadriel clade. although being members of the same evolutionary lineage, banana chromoviruses from distinct clades partly differed in their chromosomal distribution. contrary to monkey, which preferentially localized in secondary constrictions  <cit> , members of other clades occupied mostly pericentromeric regions and some additional loci in distal parts of all chromosomes .

non-ltr retrotransposons and dna transposons
compared to ltr-retrotransposons, non-ltr retrotransposons and dna transposons were found relatively rare . within the clusters that represented at least  <dig> % of the genome, only one cluster of line sequences  <cit>  and two clusters of dna transposons were identified. the line elements were estimated to constitute about 1% of the banana genome. fish with a probe derived from reverse transcriptase domain of a line-like element, resulted in dot signals in centromeric regions on all chromosomes . dna transposons identified in this work included elements that showed similarity to transposons belonging to the hat superfamily  <cit> . fish with a probe derived from hat-related element failed to give visible signals, most probably due to relatively small copy number. the low abundance of lines and dna transposons seems to be typical for plant genomes and similar abundances were observed for example in rice, grape and maize genomes  <cit> .

45s and 5s rdna
clusters containing 45s rdna represented  <dig> % of the genome and the 45s rdna sequence region was reconstructed as a  <dig>  bp fragment that included complete sequence of the 18s- <dig> s-26s rrna locus surrounded by parts of intergenic spacer . moreover, based on similarity searches to bac clone ma4_01c <dig> from m. acuminata, which was sequenced within the context of the global musa genomics consortium  <cit>  and which carries 45s rdna units, another cluster containing igs-like sequence was identified in the  <dig> data.

in contrast to balint-kurti et al.  whose results obtained after fish with mitotic chromosomes indicated insertion of a part of monkey into 45s rdna  <cit> , our  <dig> data suggests that monkey is not frequently associated with the 18s- <dig> s-26s rrna gene copies. a plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the insertion is adjacent to the 45s rdna locus. in fact, the spatial resolution of fish on mitotic chromosomes is not sufficient to discriminate two loci closer than  <dig> -  <dig> mbp  <cit> . a close vicinity of the monkey fragment to 45s rdna is supported by the sequence data of the bac ma4_01c <dig> comprising 45s rdna, in which a  <dig> kb fragment of monkey was identified. however, the fragment was not inserted in the 45srdna or igs sequences. the fact that this bac comprises a chromovirus element from the tekay lineage and the sire1/maximus lineage indicates that the bac ma4_01c <dig> actually encompasses a border of the 45s rdna locus and flanking genomic sequences, characterized by sequence-heterogeneity and insertion of various mobile elements.

similar to the 45s rrna gene cluster, our  <dig> sequence data enabled reconstruction of the entire coding part of the 5s rrna gene and its non-transcribed spacer. the 5s rdna was found to represent  <dig> % of the banana nuclear genome. teo et al.  <cit>  identified a ty1/copia-like element in the 5s rdna spacer in several banana species. the analysis of retrotransposon protein coding domains in our data confirmed that the 5s rdna spacer contained a part of the reverse transcriptase of the tnt1-like element.

tandem organized repeats
repeat reconstruction from the  <dig> data led to discovery of two new tandemly organized repeats. one of them  consists of ~ <dig> bp monomer while the cl <dig> repeat is characterized by ~ <dig> kb monomer unit. fish on mitotic chromosomes revealed clusters of signals in the subtelomeric regions of one pair of chromosomes  and weak signals in telomeric region on two pairs of chromosomes  . southern hybridization resulted in a ladder-like pattern typical for tandemly organized repetitive units for repeat cl <dig>  only . the repeat cl <dig> gave a weak smear with a few visible bands, most likely due to partially dispersed distribution and/or poor conservation of the monomer length. a rather low copy number of cl <dig> and/or long repetitive unit of satellite cl <dig> may explain why these repeats were not identified in previous studies  <cit> . in general, the absence of more abundant tandem repeats in the banana genome may be related to its relatively small size. satellite dna is a typical component of subtelomeric and centromeric chromosome regions in various plant species, but they often form blocks of repeats in interstitial regions  <cit> . the results of this study, as well as our earlier observations  <cit>  indicate that typical centromeric satellite dna is absent in the banana genome, and that the centromeric regions are likely to be made of various types of retrotransposons.

identification of dna markers
following the thorough characterization of banana repetitive dna, we screened the  <dig> sequences for the presence of loci potentially suitable for use as dna markers. we focused on identification of simple sequence repeats  and sites of insertions of transposable elements   <cit> . in total,  <dig>  of  <dig> reads containing ssrs were identified with repeat units ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the most abundant motifs were dinucleotides ta and ga and trinucleotides gaa . more than  <dig>  reads were identified to contain potential isbp sites, most of them carrying insertions of retrotransposons into unknown low-copy sequences. databases containing  <dig> reads carrying ssr sequences and potential isbps were established and made publicly available on our website  <cit> .

repeat identification in sequenced dna clones
as the next step in utilizing  <dig> data, we took advantage of the read clustering during repeat analysis and created databases of sequence reads sorted according to their repeat of origin. these databases were then utilized for similarity-based repeat detection and classification in genomic bac clone sequences implemented at the profrep server  <cit> . the analysis was performed for  <dig> bac clones from m. acuminata cv. 'calcutta 4' and for  <dig> bac clones from m. balbisiana cv. 'pisang klutug wulung'  <cit> . the clones were sequenced as part of the generation challenge program supported project  and were selected based on the presence of resistance gene homologs and other gene-like sequences. indeed, out of the  <dig> m. acuminata bac clones, only  <dig> clones were highly repetitive.  <dig> bac clones contained a single copy sequence with a large repetitive region and the remaining bac clones comprised single copy sequence without any detectable repetitive dna and/or carried a very short repetitive region . out of the  <dig> bac clones from m. balbisiana, two were single copy, while the remaining  <dig> bac clones carried low copy sequences mixed with large repetitive regions. the repetitive profiles of all  <dig> bac clones are available as supplementary data .

CONCLUSIONS
this work represents a major advance in the analysis of the nuclear genome organization in banana, an important staple and cash crop. the application of low-depth  <dig> sequencing provided until now the largest amount of dna sequence data, and enabled a detailed analysis of repetitive components of its nuclear genome. all major types of dna repeats were characterized and musa dna repeats databases were established. the analysis of genomic distribution of selected repeats provided new data on long-range molecular organization of banana chromosomes, and a large number of loci potentially useful as dna markers were identified. the improved knowledge and resources generated in this study will be useful in annotating the banana genome sequence, in the analysis of the evolution of the musa genome, and for the study of dynamics of dna repeats over evolutionary time scale, as well as to isolate dna markers for use in genetic diversity studies and in marker-assisted selection.
