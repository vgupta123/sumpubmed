BACKGROUND
malaria, a disease caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus plasmodium , is responsible for the death of one million people every year, mostly children living in sub-saharan africa  <cit> . the burden of morbidity and mortality inflicted by this disease presents a serious hindrance to socioeconomic development, causing up to a  <dig> % decrease in the gross domestic product of countries with a high malaria rate  <cit> . the number of deaths due to malaria doubled in the last two decades of the 20th century, with one of the primary reasons being the spread of parasite resistance to anti-malarial drugs, especially chloroquine  <cit> . artemisinin combination therapy  has helped to reverse this trend, but the worrying appearance in southeast asia of parasite isolates with reduced artemisinin sensitivity suggests that this may be a short-lived respite  <cit> . the development of anti-malarial drugs with novel modes of action remains an urgent priority.

reversible phosphorylation is an integral part of many cellular processes, and perturbations in its regulation have been identified in many diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . protein kinases  are therefore attracting much interest as potential drug targets, and recent successes in cancer chemotherapy based on kinase inhibitors indicate that these molecules can perform as drugs with appropriate selectivity, potency and pharmacokinetic properties  <cit> . investigations of the druggability of the genome identified serine/threonine pks as one of the most promising groups for future small molecule inhibitors, comprising up to 20% of the druggable genome  <cit> .

protein kinase ck <dig>  is a pleiotropic serine/threonine pk, with over  <dig> substrates identified in mammalian cells  <cit>  and documented roles in multiple cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, survival, translation, apoptosis, transformation, tumorigenesis, rna synthesis, cell cycle progression, cell morphology and polarity, cellular responses to stress and to dna damage, and circadian rhythm  <cit> . the enzyme phosphorylates a range of dna-binding proteins, nuclear oncoproteins, and transcription factors  <cit> , and several studies have highlighted the predominance of ck <dig> substrates involved in transcription, chromatin structure, and gene expression  <cit> . taken together, these studies highlight transcriptional regulation as one of the major roles of the enzyme  <cit> . controlled cellular compartmentalization is crucial for the function of a pleiotropic enzyme such as ck <dig>  and substrate selection is presumably dependent on proper targeting  <cit> . although predominantly nuclear  <cit> , mammalian ck <dig> has also been found in the cytoplasm, in association with a number of organelles such as the golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes  <cit> , and plant chloroplasts  <cit> . the human genome contains two genes encoding catalytic  subunits, and a single gene encoding a regulatory  subunit. ck <dig> is present in human cells as a tetrameric complex comprising two identical β subunits and two catalytic subunits, which can be assembled in a α/α, α/α' or α'/α' configuration. ck2α has been found to be essential for viability in all organisms in which its role has been assessed, including p. falciparum  <cit> . the requirement for viability of the β subunits of ck <dig> varies across species: disruption of the single metazoan β subunit is lethal in mice  <cit>  and caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , whereas disruption of either or both of the β subunits in saccharomyces cerevisiae is not lethal  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of p. falciparum pks  <cit>  identified a ck2α ortholog and two putative ck2β subunits, pfck2β <dig> and pfck2β <dig> . the stoichiometry of the pfck <dig> complexes is not known; by analogy with other systems, it is hypothesized that a homo- or heterodimer of β subunits is complexed with two catalytic subunits in the holoenzyme, but this still requires experimental demonstration. using transcriptomics, it has been shown that all three subunits are expressed throughout the asexual erythrocytic asexual cycle, in gametocytes and in sporozoites  <cit> . proteomics data available for pfck2α and pfck2β <dig> indicate that both proteins are present in the asexual erythrocytic stages and gametocytes, and that the α subunit is also present in sporozoites  <cit> . we showed previously that pfck2α is essential for completion of the erythrocytic asexual cycle  <cit> , but neither the requirement of the β subunits for viability nor the cellular processes implicating the enzyme have been assessed.

in the current study, we used a reverse-genetics approach, and found that both regulatory subunits are also essential for intra-erythrocytic asexual proliferation. reasoning that identifying interactors of the regulatory subunits might provide useful insight into the cellular functions of the pfck <dig> holoenzyme, we analyzed the protein composition of complexes obtained by co-immunoprecipitation of pfck2β <dig> or pfck2β <dig> from transgenic parasite lines expressing tagged subunits. this allowed us to recover proteins involved in many cellular processes, consistent with our immunofluorescence assay  data localizing the kinase subunits to both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. to investigate the role of ck <dig> in gene regulation specifically, we focused validation experiments on nuclear proteins, and found that several proteins involved in chromatin dynamics, which were recovered in the β subunit pull-downs, are substrates for pfck2α in vitro. taken together, our data identify pfck <dig> as an essential kinase involved in chromatin dynamics.

RESULTS
both of the ck2β subunits play crucial roles in the erythrocytic asexual cycle
we first aimed to determine whether pfck <dig> β subunits play essential functions in parasite proliferation. ck2β proteins possess two conserved pairs of cysteine residues that form the base of a zinc finger required for homo- and heterodimerization  <cit> , a prerequisite for ck <dig> holoenzyme formation  <cit> . to generate plasmids able to disrupt pfck2β genes, an internal fragment of the coding sequence excluding those crucial motifs was amplified and cloned into the transfection vector pcam-bsd, which confers resistance to blasticidin  <cit> . it was expected that integration of the constructs  into their cognate genomic loci by single crossover homologous recombination would result in a pseudo-diploid configuration, in which both truncated copies would be unable to express a functional protein . after two independent transfections of pcam-bsd-kopfck2β <dig> into 3d <dig> parasites, integration was monitored by pcr in the blasticidin-resistant populations , using primer combinations that allow discrimination between the episome, the wild-type locus, and the disrupted locus. only the episome  and the wild-type locus  were detectable, with no sign of integration even after prolonged culture . this might be due either to the fact that pfck2β <dig> is essential to the completion of the asexual parasite cycle, or to the possible refractoriness of the locus to recombination.

to ascertain whether pfckβ <dig> can be disrupted if the subunit is provided through expression of an episomal copy of the gene, we constructed a complementation plasmid  containing the full-length pfckβ <dig> gene under the control of the pfhsp <dig> promoter and a 3' utr. in parallel with the transfection of the pcam-bsd-kopfck2β <dig> plasmid alone, a population of parasites was transfected with both pcam-bsd-kopfck2β <dig> and pchd-pfck2β <dig>  pcr  and southern blot  analyses showed that disruption of the targeted locus occurred only in this doubly transfected, doubly resistant parasite culture. probing the membrane with a bsd probe  confirmed that integration had occurred only in the parasites transfected with both the knockout and complementation plasmids. the pfckβ <dig> probe hybridized to the  <dig>  kb band, corresponding to the wild-type locus, in the lane that contained dna from untransfected parasites and from parasites transfected with the knockout plasmid alone . this band was undetectable in dna from parasites transfected with both the knockout and complementation plasmid , indicating that the gene can be disrupted only when an additional cassette coding for the pfck2β <dig> subunit is provided to the parasites. there are multiple possibilities for recombination of the knockout and complementation plasmids before or after integration, which presumably accounts for the additional bands. the crucial observation is the disappearance of the wild-type-specific band only in the doubly transfected parasite culture. similar results were obtained for pfck2β <dig> , indicating that both regulatory subunits play crucial roles in parasite proliferation in the red blood cell.

pfck <dig> subunits localize to both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments
to generate parasite lines expressing tagged pfck2β <dig> or pfck2β <dig> from the endogenous loci, we transfected wild-type parasites with 3'-ha-tagged constructs , which were expected not to cause loss of function of the target protein upon integration into the cognate locus. integration of the tagging construct and disappearance of the wild-type locus were readily achieved for both genes . to determine the subcellular localization of ha-tagged pfck2α  <cit> , pfck2β <dig> or pfck2β <dig> subunits, we examined these transgenic lines in ifas using antibodies against the ha epitope and against exp <dig>  a parasitophorous vacuole marker  <cit>  . in line with the pleiotropic nature of ck <dig> in eukaryotic cells, a signal for all three subunits was detectable in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of the parasite. the location of ha-tagged pfck2α and pfck2β <dig> in rings, trophozoites, and schizonts was further examined by immuno-electron microscopy, which confirmed presence of the protein in both cytoplasm and nucleus . furthermore, bands of the expected sizes of all three subunits were clearly visible on anti-ha western blots in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of unsynchronized cultures of the three ha-tagged parasite lines . antibodies against aldolase, a cytoplasmic marker, and against histone h <dig>  a nuclear marker, were used to probe the same western-blot membrane to ascertain the purity of the subcellular fractions . in conclusion, our data suggest that pfck <dig> subunits are expressed throughout erythrocytic schizogony, and are present in various subcellular locations.

purification and mass spectrometry analysis of protein complexes involving the pfck2β subunits
to gain insight into the functions of pfck <dig> through identification of the proteins with which the holoenzyme interacts, we subjected protein extracts from the parasite line expressing ha-tagged pfck2β <dig> to immunoprecipitation using the anti-ha antibody; the same analysis was performed on extracts from wild-type parasites as a negative control. the immunoprecipitates were separated by sds-page, and a western blotting was performed using anti-pfck2β <dig> to verify the immunoprecipitation efficiency . a parallel gel was loaded and slices excised  for mass spectrometry analysis.

potential interactors  were identified based on the number of unique peptides recovered, and on the unweighted spectrum count of the number of detected peptides. we considered proteins as potential hits if they were present in the immunoprecipitate from the ha-tagged line but were absent  in those from the wild-type parasites. the same experiment was performed in parallel with the parasite line expressing ha-tagged pfck2β <dig> , although in this case we were unable to perform western-blot verification of the immunoprecipitate because of the poor quality of the anti- pfck2β <dig> antibody.

pfck2α was pulled down with both ha-pfck2β <dig> and ha-pfck2β <dig>  in line with the previously reported in vitro interaction between the catalytic subunit and both regulatory subunits  <cit> . interestingly, pfck2β <dig> and pfck2β <dig> were present in similar amounts in both immunoprecipitates, suggesting that complexes containing both regulatory subunits may be relatively abundant.

we examined the distribution of all other potential interactors among the various parasite metabolic processes described in the malaria parasite metabolic pathways  website  . although some pathways were not represented at all in the immunoprecipitates, or had only a very small number of entries, others displayed many hits in both lists.

a different distribution pattern was seen when the same protocol, using the same anti-ha antibody, was applied to parasites expressing other ha-tagged kinases, such as pfck <dig> ; this result lends support to the specificity of the pull-down approach. for both pfck2β subunits, the highest numbers of potential interactors were found in the processes of 1) post-translational modifications, and 2) mitosis and chromosome separation. as we were aiming to understand the nuclear function of pfck <dig>  we focused further investigations on the latter process.

each metabolic process covers several specific pathways. of the various pathways grouped under the 'mitosis and chromosome separation' process, some contained very few or no hits . by contrast,  <dig> proteins belonging to the 'nucleosome assembly and regulation pathway'  were found in the pfck2β immunoprecipitates . these included both p. falciparum nucleosome assembly proteins pfnapl  and pfnaps . co-immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to western-blot analysis established that ha-tagged pck2α can also pull down both pfnaps . naps are negatively charged proteins that act as histone chaperones and function as histone depositors, allowing ordered formation of chromatin at definite sites. pfnapl and pfnaps proteins interact in vitro with p. falciparum histones h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig>  and are in vitro substrates for human ck <dig>  <cit> . a number of histones and their variants, and several proteins thought to be involved in virulence-gene regulation through association with sub-telomeric chromatin at the nuclear periphery, were also identified in the β subunit precipitates. these included two of the four alba p. falciparum proteins that have recently been identified as perinuclear dna-rna-binding proteins and thought to play a role in gene regulation in asexual stages  <cit> ; the prototype alba protein was described as an archeal chromatin protein  <cit> .

aproteins found in the ha-pfck2β <dig> and ha-pfck2β <dig> immunoprecipitates, which are part of the 'nucleosome assembly and regulation pathway' described in the mpmp website, or have been implicated in chromatin dynamics.

p. falciparum naps, histones and alba proteins are substrates for pfck2α in vitro
we tested whether recombinant pfck2α could phosphorylate selected chromatin-associated proteins from the potential pfck2β interactor list. kinase assays were performed with glutatione s-transferase -tagged pfck2α, using a gst-pfck2α k72m dead mutant as a negative control . pfck2α autophosphorylation generated a band of ~ <dig> kda in size, but the dead mutant did not autophosphorylate, and was unable to phosphorylate exogenous substrates, as previously reported  <cit> . when subjected to a kinase assay using pfck2α, both recombinant pfnaps were phosphorylated, with pfnapl  giving a very strong signal , and pfnaps  appearing as a much less efficient substrate  . no phosphorylation of the nap proteins was seen, either with the pfck <dig> kinase-dead-mutant control, nor with the unrelated pk pfpk <dig>  <cit> , despite the ability of the latter enzyme to autophosphorylate and to phosphorylate myelin basic proteins in our assay conditions .

we next examined the ability of histones to act as substrates for recombinant gst-pfck2α. recently, several phosphorylation sites in plasmodial histones have been identified , and because several histones were recovered in the pfck2β precipitates , we thought that pfck2α might be one of the kinases that can phosphorylate histones. when purified parasite native histones were subjected to a gst-pfck2α kinase assay, preferential phosphorylation of histone h2b  was seen, whereas the dead-mutant kinase failed to phosphorylate any of the histones . we also tested in pfck2α kinase assays all four p. falciparum alba members expressed as gst fusion proteins  <cit> , as well as the nuclear protein pfsir <dig>  which is implicated in establishment of heterochromatin in sub-telomeric region and hence represses var gene expression  <cit> . pfalba <dig>  pfalba <dig>  and sir <dig> were not phosphorylated by gst-pfck2α . by contrast, pfalba <dig>  and pfalba <dig>  gave signals on the autoradiographs after a kinase assay was performed with gst-pfck2α, whereas none of the substrates subjected to the gst-pfck2α dead mutant was phosphorylated .

discussion
our reverse-genetics data strongly suggest that both pfck2β subunits are essential for parasite viability, indicating that they have non-redundant functions in the parasite. this was unexpected given the dispensability of the β subunits for viability in s. cerevisiae  and ib schizosaccharomyces pombe   <cit> . however, the single β subunit present in c. elegans  <cit>  and in mice  <cit>  is essential. the different interactomes for the ck2β subunits in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  are consistent with functional specialization of each β subunit. the immunoprecipitates obtained with pfck2β <dig> and pfck2β <dig>  despite displaying significant overlap in the identity of recovered proteins, also contained hits that were found in only one of the two immunoprecipitates . this would be consistent with the non-redundancy in function suggested by reverse genetics; however, we do not have sufficient data to draw any firm conclusion in this respect. the dataset presented in the supplementary material  is from one of three experiments. although several hits obtained in the first dataset were confirmed in two further experiments, fewer proteins were recovered in the latter, pre-empting statistical analysis, more work is needed to confirm that individual proteins are truly absent from one of the other pfck2β interactome. however, the data  nevertheless enabled us to propose assignment of specific functions to pfck <dig> 

using recombinant proteins in pull-down experiments, we previously found that pfck2α is able to interact with both β subunits in vitro  <cit> . ms analysis of immunoprecipitated subunits  indicates that these interactions are also found in parasite extracts. ck <dig> is known to have several functions in various organisms  <cit> , and the glimpse into the interactomes of the p. falciparum ck <dig> regulatory subunits provided by our study is consistent with their involvement in a number of cellular processes. implementing the same protocol with different ha-tagged kinases such as pfck <dig>  yielded protein repertoires that were clearly distinct from those described here for the pfck2β subunits, lending support to the specificity of the approach. potential pfck <dig> interactors were found in  <dig> out of  <dig> metabolic processes described on the mpmp website. many processes displayed only a very small number of hits; whether or not these represent genuine interactors will require in-depth investigations of each individual case.

by contrast, other processes and pathways exhibited a large proportion of their proteins recovered in the immunoprecipitates, suggesting that a number of distinct functional complexes had been pulled down. a striking example is the 'nucleosome assembly and regulation' pathway, many components of which were found in both pfck2β <dig> and pfck2β <dig> immunoprecipitates . this included both pfnaps, many histones, and several proteins involved in chromatin remodelling . interestingly, all recovered proteins were members of the so-called 'activating factors' in this pathway, whereas none of the 'inactivating factors' were present in the immunoprecipitates , which again is consistent with the specificity of the approach. some of these interactions were validated by coupled co-immunoprecipitation/western-blot analysis  and in vitro kinase assays .

both pfnap proteins were phosphorylated by recombinant pfck2α. in yeast, phosphorylation of nap1by one of the two catalytic subunits of ck <dig> is implicated in cell cycle progression, as cells expressing ck <dig> phosphorylation site nap <dig> mutants display a lengthened s-phase and a shortened g <dig> phase, together resulting in a delay in mitosis. interestingly, these mutants retained the wild-type ability to interact with histones  <cit> . it has been proposed that phosphorylation of the pfnaps by human recombinant ck <dig> may affect their affinity for histones  <cit> . pfck <dig> might also act on pfnaps in vivo, thus affecting their function, and in accordance with this hypothesis, recent global phosphoproteomic analyses of parasite extracts  <cit>  found both pfnaps be phosphorylated on acidic peptides predicted to be ck <dig> substrates by the netphos tool .

aphosphosites predicted to be ck <dig> substrates by analysis using the kinasephos <dig> tool http://kinasephos <dig> mbc.nctu.edu.tw/ are highlighted in bthe phosphosite in the peptides are indicated by lowercase s or t. bold characters, and the score is indicated in the fourth column.

conly the sites experimentally shown to be phosphorylated are included here; note that there are additional predicted ck <dig> sites in these proteins.

we found that pfck2α preferentially phosphorylated histone h2b in vitro in a mixture of native histones extracted from the parasite. histone post-translational modifications such as methylation and acetylation play key roles in the control of expression of virulence genes  in malaria parasites  <cit> ) similarly, histone phosphorylation is known to play an important regulatory role in other eukaryotes  <cit> , and in yeast, ck <dig> phosphorylates histone h <dig> at serine  <dig> as part of a dna damage-signaling pathway  <cit> . although previous studies have identified few phosphorylation marks in p. falciparum histones, we recently characterized several novel phosphorylation marks on the parasite's histones . whether pfck <dig> is responsible for phosphorylation of any of these sites in vivo, and the functional consequences of these phosphorylation events, remain to be investigated. nevertheless, taken together, our data strongly suggest that pfck2-dependent phosphorylation may play a role in chromatin dynamics.

we also tested other known nuclear proteins with a potential role in gene regulation to see if they could be substrates for the kinase. of all the proteins tested, recombinant pfalba <dig> and pfalba <dig> were found to be substrates for the pfck2α in vitro , and pfalba <dig> was found to be phosphorylated in parasite extracts on several residues  <cit> , including one in an acidic stretch consistent with ck <dig> substrate preferences . by contrast, recombinant pfalba <dig>  pfalba <dig>  and pfsir <dig> were not phosphorylated by the kinase . pfalba <dig> and pfalba <dig> belong to the same phylogenetic cluster, which is distinct from that containing pfalba <dig> and pfalba <dig> , consistent with their different ease if phosphorylation by pfck <dig>  moreover, the former two pfalbas possess an arginine- and glycine-rich rgg domain in addition to the alba domain. it has been shown in s. cerevisiae that phosphorylation of the rgg domains affects protein localization and transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm  <cit> . given that pfalba <dig> and pfalba <dig> concentrate at the perinuclear space in ring-stage parasites, but expand to the cytoplasm of trophozoites and schizonts  <cit> , it is possible that phosphorylation by pfck <dig> may contribute to the regulation of their nucleocytoplasmic transport.

several proteins involved in mitosis and chromosome separation and in dna replication and dna damage pathways  were also pulled down. implication of ck <dig> in the dna damage response is well documented in other systems  <cit> , and a dna repair pathway has been characterized in p. falciparum  <cit> , of which the dna polymerase and dna ligase components can be retrieved in the ck2β immunoprecipitates . because dna repair is markedly reduced in the highly drug-resistant w <dig> isolate, which displays a higher rate of drug-resistance acquisition than do drug-sensitive strains  <cit> , it might be of interest to compare ck <dig> activity in the w <dig> versus drug-sensitive clones.

although many of the proteins identified in the immunoprecipitates were of nuclear origin, a number of potential interactors were associated with other cellular compartments. some of the recovered proteins were putative or established maurer's cleft proteins , proteins involved in invasion and motility processes  or in cell-cell interaction processes . likewise, several proteins and enzymes involved in redox metabolism were recovered . this diversity is consistent with our ifa, western blot, and immuno-em data localizing all the three subunits to both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. although these results require confirmation by other approaches, and despite the fact that we cannot exclude false positives in our interactome list, they are consistent with an involvement of pfck <dig> kinase in varied cellular functions in the parasite.

the availability of parasite lines expressing individual tagged pks for the almost entire p. falciparum kinome  <cit>  now allows implementation of a kinome-wide investigation of kinase function based on the interactomics approach used here for pfck <dig>  preliminary data obtained with other pks suggest that distinct functions can therefore be assigned to different enzymes on the basis of specifically pulled-down protein repertoires.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified the pfck <dig> complex as a kinase distributed to different cellular compartments. our data point to pfck <dig> as a pleiotropic kinase with various cellular functions. in this study, we explored potential nuclear functions of the kinase, and we propose a role for pfck <dig> in modifying a number of chromatin-related proteins, several of which are also substrates for the catalytic subunit of pfck <dig> in vitro. furthermore, reverse genetics data show that all three subunits of the kinase are essential for the viability of the blood-stage parasite, confirming its potential as target for chemotherapeutic intervention. this study paves the way for a kinome-wide interactomics-based approach to elucidate pk function in malaria parasites.
