BACKGROUND
roses  belong to the rosaceae family and are the most important ornamental plants, comprising 30% of the floriculture market. the rosaceae family consists of more than  <dig> genera and  <dig>  species, including many important fruits, nuts, ornamental, and wood crops  <cit> . members of this family provide high-value nutritional food and contribute desirable aesthetic and industrial products. in addition, there are abundant genomic resources from recently released genome sequences for apple, strawberry, and peach  that will contribute to better understanding of rosaceae biology  <cit> . despite active genomic studies of fruit-bearing rosaceae, molecular studies of ornamental roses have been limited, except for those focused on supporting breeding strategies.

the development of molecular markers for roses began with the first molecular linkage map covering over  <dig> markers from rosa multiflora hybrids  <cit> , and several genetic maps were constructed recently  <cit> . however, the genetic resources for roses are relatively weak compared to those for other rosaceae families. as of june  <dig>  approximately  <dig>  unigenes were available. these were generated from  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  for rose in the genome database for rosaceae   <cit> . these unigenes cover only  <dig> % of apple genes,  <dig> % of strawberry genes, and  <dig> % of peach genes. clearly, more abundant transcriptomic resources generated from different roses are needed to allow for the investigation of key traits, including resistance to disease or stress, flower morphology, and scent  <cit> .

transcriptome sequences are often analyzed from both model and non-model plants to monitor whole gene expression. whole gene expression is useful to identify biotic  <cit>  or abiotic stress related genes  <cit> , understand organ development  <cit>  and characterize differential traits between closely related species of rose  <cit> . next-generation sequencing  technologies, such as illumina, solexa, genome sequencer flx system , and abi solid, allow analysis of the transcriptome because of increased throughput and reduced sequencing cost  <cit> . the gs flx is considered by many to be the most powerful platform to analyze protein-coding sequence data with strengths, including long reads, good accuracy, and the ability to support ultra-high-throughput analysis  <cit> . because of these strengths, gs flx is often applied to generate transcriptome data . transcriptomic data in ornamental plants like roses expands our knowledge of the genetic control of flower quality. these findings can be applied in the floricultural industry to advance efforts to screen economically important phenotypes  <cit> . here, we generated transcriptomes of four rosa cultivars using gs flx sequencing to compare floral development and other features.

micrornas  are short  non-protein-coding rnas  <cit> , which play essential roles in regulating plant growth and development  <cit> . mirna genes, called mir genes, are transcribed by rna polymerase ii , and the mirna transcripts form self-complementary fold-back structures called primary mirna . pri-mirnas are processed to mature rnas  through cleavage by dicer-like  <dig>  protein  <cit> . after release into the cytosol, mirnas bind near-perfectly to their target mrnas, and the remaining strands  are degraded. mirnas regulate expression of target mrna post-transcriptionally through either cleavage of the target mrna or translational inhibition.

mirnas are often identified by cloning or by bioinformatic alignment to known mirnas. however, several strategies have been developed to computationally identify mirnas from deep sequencing data  <cit> . these algorithms, which were initially designed for vertebrate mirnas, are now able to predict plant mirnas considering different features of plant mirnas  <cit> . there are several databases of annotated and predicted mirnas for plants that can be used in bioinformatic approaches for mirna identification, including mirbase  <cit>  and the plant mirna database   <cit> . these recent developments of high-throughput sequencing techniques and analysis tools, as well as databases for mirnas, challenge us to identify mirnas from various plant species.

in this study, we constructed a rose database of transcriptomes and mirna sequences and annotations generated from flower tissues of three rosa hybrid cultivars  and r. rugosa thunb. . we included data from the three sequenced rosaceae genomes  and the grape genome. in the rose database, users can analyze gene contents, gene families, phylogenetics, and mirna profiles from a publicly available website . these data can be used to identify candidate mirnas and target genes that may regulate flower development and hormonal regulation. it can be used to establish a genetic basis of valuable phenotypes of rose flowers. to demonstrate the utility of the database, we describe mirnas that are highly conserved among rosa , as well as statistically abundant mirnas in one rose than others. several target genes of mirnas were experimentally validated using 5' race, and most of them were transcription factors regulating flower development. therefore, rose database provides a comprehensive resource to understand flower development and to identify new candidate genes for studying rose phenotypes.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequence assembly from rose flower libraries
we constructed sequencing libraries from complete flower tissue of three rosa hybrid cultivars, including red corvette , maroussia, and sympathy, and r. rugosa thunb. , and sequenced them using the gs flx platform. a total of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   reads were generated from ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haedang’, respectively . the average read length was 219– <dig> bp for each library. prior to assembly, we masked low-complexity and poly  sequences and removed reads shorter than  <dig> bp using the seqclean program downloaded from the dana farber cancer institute  . after pre-processing, 88-94% of raw data remained to be clustered and assembled into contigs .

to construct contigs, the tigr gene index clustering tools  package implements mgblast to collect reads into clusters, and cap <dig> was used to assemble clustered reads into contigs  <cit> . after clustering, clusters contained  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the pre-processed reads for ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haedang’, respectively . using the clusters, the cap <dig> constructed  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  contigs for ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haedang’, respectively. those contigs contained 95-97% of the clustered reads. average contig lengths were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  bp for ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haedang’, respectively . there are  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   singlets, including both un-clustered reads and reads that are clustered but are not assembled into contigs.

comparative analysis and functional annotation of rose flower mirnas
the scheme used to develop functional annotation for roses is depicted in figure  <dig>  we downloaded genes for three sequenced rosaceae genomes   <cit>  and grape  <cit>  to compare to rose unigenes. we annotated rose unigenes  and other protein-coding genes by implementing blastx against non-redundant -protein and arabidopsis protein sequences. we found that 51%, 61%, 58%, and 51% of unigenes aligned to known and/or hypothetical proteins for ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haedang’, respectively . although rose unigenes were annotated at a lower level than those of related species, , approximately 64-77% of rose contigs were annotated. using pfam, we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  distinct domains within the ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haedang’ unigenes, respectively . these numbers are slightly less than the numbers of domains identified in apple , strawberry , peach , and grape  genes . the reason why smaller numbers of domains were identified in rosa is probably due to the fact that the genes which contain unidentified domains were expressed at lower levels in rose flowers or only expressed in non-flower tissues.

b number of domain identified by implementing pfam. abbreviations: v: ‘vital’; m: ‘maroussia’; s: ‘sympathy’; h: ‘haedang’.

to identify functional and evolutional relationships, we analyzed orthologs and paralogs of  <dig>  gene/unigenes from  <dig> rosa, apple, strawberry, peach and grape, by implementing orthomcl  <cit> . we found that  <dig>  genes were clustered into  <dig>  gene families, suggesting that  <dig> % of total genes or unigenes have similarity among species . approximately 23% of the  <dig>  gene families were homologous to arabidopsis gene families in the arabidopsis information resource  database. the tair provides  <dig> gene families and  <dig>  genes, covering  <dig> % of arabidopsis genes  <cit> . gene family comparisons provide the number of conserved and shared genes in plants available in the rose database and the number of species-specific gene families for each species . on the whole,  <dig>  gene families corresponding to  <dig>  genes were conserved in  <dig> plants analyzed in this study , and  <dig> gene families corresponding to  <dig>  genes were common to all rosaceae species, indicating that conserved functions were specific to rosaceae . in rose,  <dig>  gene families with  <dig>  genes were common to  <dig> rosa and were not conserved in fruit-bearing rosaceae species . additionally,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> gene families were specific to vital, maroussia, sympathy, and haedang, respectively . of the species-specific gene families, only 3-6% was annotated based on homology to arabidopsis gene families, suggesting these may be the gene families evolved within each rose.

mirna analysis
we sequenced flower small rna  sequences for roses using the illumina gaiix platform and generated an average of  <dig> , <dig> srnas per rose . after pre-processing,  <dig> , <dig>  unique srna sequences, with 18– <dig> nucleotides  in length, were remained for mapping. the srnas were dominantly 24nt, 21nt, and 22nt in length, whose production relied on dcl <dig>  dcl <dig> and dcl <dig>  respectively .  <cit> , as previously observed in other plant species  <cit> . in order to distinguish mirnas from all other srnas, we predicted secondary structures of mirnas by mapping  <dig>  million srna sequences to the strawberry genome because there is no genome available for rose.  <dig> , <dig>  srna tags were perfectly mapped to the strawberry genome after discarding srnas that are aligned to more than  <dig> loci in the strawberry genome. we predicted secondary structures using rnafold, and the sequences used for this prediction were  <dig> bp marginal sequences from mapped srna. we validated mirnas which meet the criterion of plant mirna annotation  <cit> . finally, we predicted  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> known and novel mirnas for vital, maroussia, sympathy, and haedang, respectively . among them,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were novel mirnas for vital, maroussia, sympathy, and haedang, respectively. . to screen additional conserved mirnas from unmapped srnas, we aligned the rose srnas to conserved mirnas from the mirbase  <cit>  . using similarity search, we additionally annotated  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and,  <dig> conserved mirnas for vital, maroussia, sympathy, and haedang, respectively, which may be missed during the mapping to the strawberry genome due to lower sequence similarities or construction of hairpin structures . based on above analysis, we identified  <dig> distinct mirnas, including  <dig> novel mirnas. the size distribution of srna showed that approximately 98% of mirnas fell within the range of 19– <dig> nt, especially abundant  <dig> nt in length . in addition, 65% and 12% of the  <dig> nt srnas had 5’ uridine  and adenosine , whose characteristic depends on dicer cleavage and argonaute  <dig> and  <dig>  association, respectively  <cit> .

conserved mirnas in four roses and rosaceae
we investigated conservation and/or variation of mirnas in rose flowers by analyzing the presence or absence of mirna tags among four rosa cultivars . the mirna tags denote individual mirna with sequence redundancies. we found that two mirna tags are uniquely expressed in maroussia and haedang, respectively. most  of the mirnas were conserved in the four rosa cultivars . we also analyzed mirnas conserved in rosaceae. for this analysis, we retrieved srna sequences from gene expression omnibus  database for strawberry , peach , and apple . mirnas from these species were re-analyzed according to our pipeline . as a result, a total of  <dig> mirnas were conserved among rosaceae. among them,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were uniquely expressed in rose, strawberry, peach and apple, respectively . thirty mirnas were conserved in all rosaceae . strawberry has the largest number of mirnas  conserved in rosa flower, comparing to those in peach  and apple  , which suggest that strawberry is the most closely related species of rosa.

regulatory roles of conserved mirnas in rosa
plant mirnas are negative regulators of gene expression, and thus, play essential roles in developmental patterning  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that the conserved mirnas in four rosa cultivars may have evolutionally conserved functions. to address this hypothesis, we analyzed conserved mirnas whose target genes were commonly identified in rosa, and mirnas with higher reads were representatively shown . with these criteria, we selected fifteen mirna families, two of which were novel. these mirnas may have conserved function, but it is necessary to experimentally validate whether these mirnas actually regulate computationally predicted target genes. for the target validation, we selected  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> target genes whose penalty score were four or less . in the specific circumstance where the expression of a mirna target gene is regulated through mirna-directed cleavage mechanism, 5′ rna ligase-mediated-rapid amplification of cdna ends  is generally employed to confirm such targeting. therefore, it is necessary to experimentally validate whether computationally predicted targets are actually regulated by mirnas by means of mirna-directed cleavage of these targets because plant mirnas regulate their target genes mainly by cleaving them  <cit> . therefore, we isolated total rnas from four rosa cultivars and performed 5' rlm-race for squamosa-promoter binding protein , myb, apetela <dig> , no apical meristem , f-box, and auxin response factor . as a result, nine target genes of seven mirnas were successfully validated . the target gene, sbp transcription factor, was validated to be target of mir156/ <dig> families in three rosa cultivars . we observed that the sbp transcription factor was targeted both by mir <dig> and mir <dig> families in ‘sympathy’, whereas other sbp transcription factors were targeted only by mir <dig> family in haedang and ‘maroussia’ . mir <dig> and mir <dig> in plants have been grouped in one mirna family due to their high degree of sequence similarity and their conserved target, the sbp transcription factors  <cit> . additionally, for other mirnas , we confirmed mirna-directed cleavage in one or two rosa cultivars . considering the function of target genes, most of targets validated in 5' rlm-race assay were transcription factors such as sbp, myb, ap <dig>  arf, and nac transcription factors , indicating that these conserved mirnas in rosa may have important roles in flower development.

mirnas putatively determine the colour of rose
flavonoids synthesize diverse secondary metabolites determining flower colour such as antocyanins, flavonols, flavones and proantocyanidins. we aligned rosa unigenes against arabidopsis genes involved in flavonoid or carotenoid biosynthetic pathways. subsequently, we analyzed mirnas whose target genes are related to those pathways. we identified thirteen mirna families putatively targeting  <dig> target genes . to analyze mirnas regulating colour-related pathways, we examined mirna enrichment in given rosa with p-values less than  <dig>  by applying audic’s test . the mirna enrichment means that statistically over-expressed mirna tags in a given rose cultivar comparing with mirna tag constructed in another cultivar. five of the mirnas  were enriched in the white flowers of maroussia. especially, mir396e, which is predicted to target cytochrome p <dig> , had two fold higher read counts than other roses. cyp is an essential gene for synthesizing red colour in flowers, fruit, and epidermal tissues  <cit> . it is suggested that these mirnas may negatively regulate target genes to prevent accumulation of carotenoids or flavonoids, resulting in white flowers. however, no target genes with penalty scores of four or less were predicted. thus, we were not able to confirm the mirna-directed cleavage of target genes involved in colour determination. however, among the target genes, the spl and r2r3-myb transcription factors, both of which are known to negatively regulate flavonoid biosynthesis, were experimentally validated to be targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively  <cit> . in addition, the target gene of mir <dig> was predicted only in maroussia  and haedang , which indicates that the colours of the rose flowers, may be tightly regulated via complex mechanism of various mirnas in nature .

the bold characters denote enriched mirna tags with less than p< <dig>  by analyzing audic’s test  <cit> . abbreviations: v: ‘vital’; m: ‘marcia’; s: ‘sympathy’; h: ‘haedang’.

in addition to mirna profiles, we also analyzed differential expression of colour-related genes involved in carotenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis . we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes for carotenoid biosynthesis  and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigenes for flavonoid biosynthesis  for vital, maroussia, sympathy and haedang, respectively. based on these data, the number of colour-related unigenes in maroussia is lower than other roses and fruit-bearing rosaceae. moreover, all colour-related unigenes in maroussia were singlets due to smaller number of sequence reads, whereas unigenes in other roses were assembled into contigs. in summary, we found that some of the mirnas were enriched in maroussia, and the smaller number of sequencing reads of colour-related genes were found in maroussia, which raises an intriguing possibility of mirna-directed regulation of colour-related gene in maroussia.

discussion
rose breeders select roses according to particular criteria, which include cold and disease resistance, flower form, recurrent flowering, and to some degree, scent  <cit> . in spite of the importance of phenotypes for roses, only a few studies have addressed flower features at the molecular level. prior to this study, only a few thousand rose unigenes had been deposited in the est database  at ncbi . with the aim of providing valuable resources for molecular studies of rose flowers, we constructed the rose transcriptome database and analyzed mirna sequences from three r. hybrids  and haedang.

these rose cultivars were selected because of a range of structures  and colours  in their flowers . the database includes  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigenes for ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haedang’, respectively , covering an average of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of apple, strawberry, peach, and grape protein-coding genes, respectively. we annotated unigenes up to similar levels of related-species, especially in contigs . however, overall numbers of identified domains were slightly lower than those identified in related species . these domains may be expressed at lower levels in rose flowers or not expressed in flower tissues. in addition, the rose database provides additional information for the unigenes, including gene description, domains, go, po, metabolic pathway, funcat, and homologous gene families among roses, rosaceae families  and grape . the sequence dataset and high-quality annotation enabled us to analyse and compare the transcripts which are specialized in rose flowers and related species.

with the help of large-scale srna sequencing, a large number of mirnas have been identified, characterized, and reported  <cit> . however, these techniques are best applied to plant species whose genomes have been assembled, annotated and published  because it is necessary to predict and construct hairpin precursors of potential mirnas, using neighbouring genomic sequences of the mapped srnas to distinguish high quality mirnas from other srnas  <cit> . therefore, in the absence of the genome sequences, the strategy to identify mirnas is limited  <cit> .

in this study, we set out to identify highly qualified conserved and novel mirnas from floriculture plants rosa × hybrida  and haedang, for which genomes are not available. to predict hairpin precursors for potential mirnas, we mapped srna tags to the strawberry genome, the most closely related species among genome sequenced plants, and identified mature mirnas using modified mirdeep, a program that employs a probabilistic model of mirna biogenesis  <cit> . mapping srna to cross-species is possible because secondary structures for pre-mirnas are highly conserved between species  <cit> . identification of mirnas by mapping of srna to related species has strengths in that it i) maximizes the screening of novel mirnas in plants for which genome is not available, ii) allows identification of the conserved and novel mirnas between related species, and iii) provides an incremental improvement in accuracy of mirna identification by utilizing secondary structures. we might have missed some novel mirnas that are specific to roses; however, these novel mirnas are less likely to be important in functional studies because they are expressed at low levels and lack target-genes, whereas conserved mirnas are usually highly expressed  <cit> .

with this approach, we identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas for ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haedang’, respectively . of these mirnas,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were novel mirnas for ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haedang’, respectively . these novel mirnas correspond to 16–18% of the total identified mirnas. we also identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> conserved mirnas by aligning srna tags to known mirnas for ‘vital’, ‘maroussia’, ‘sympathy’, and ‘haednag’, respectively . this hybrid method maximized the identification of expressed mirnas for rose flowers, therefore providing many mirna candidates . in addition, this allows us to understand the conserved and unique regulatory processes occurring in rose flowers of different species and hybrids.

mirna research is advancing from analysis of single tissue or species to comparison of mirnas between species  <cit> , varieties  <cit> , tissues  <cit> , or different development stages  <cit> . today, ngs technologies allow for the comparison of mirna profiles with statistical analysis of the redundancy of mirna tags and enables discussion of tissue- or organ-specific mirnas  <cit> . we first compared mirna profiles among three r. hybrida cultivars and haednag to analyze the conservation and variation of mirna tags in the four roses . we identified mirna tags detected in single rose cultivar, leading to specific function to rosa. we also identified  <dig> conserved mirnas in all four roses , including  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas. among  <dig> conserved mirna,  <dig> mirna tags were also identified in strawberry. in addition,  <dig> conserved mirnas were also conserved in all rosaceae , suggesting that rosaceae share many conserved mirnas between ornamental and fruit-bearing plants. furthermore, among the conserved mirnas, seven mirna families were experimentally confirmed to regulate their target genes by cleavage mechanism using 5' race assay , suggesting that the conserved mirnas identified in this study are actually functional.

most of the target genes validated in this study were transcription factors , and their mutant phenotypes were characterized in many model plants . over-expression of mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  induced delayed flowering in arabidopsis by negatively regulating spl and myb family transcription factors genes, respectively  <cit> . the expression of mir167-resistant arf <dig>  leads to arrested ovule development and indehiscent anthers  <cit> . mir <dig>  is crucial for development of reproductive organs and for timely termination of floral stem cells by regulating ap <dig> rna stability  <cit> . the expression of mir172-resistant ap <dig> induces the formation of variable numbers of floral organs with numerous petals and lacking inner whorl organs  <cit> . mir <dig> regulates development by altering expression of auxin-induced genes through arf families  <cit> . mir <dig> targets cuc <dig> and cuc <dig> transcripts in arabidopsis and controls leaf margin development. therefore, we assumed that the conserved mirnas, which were experimentally validated in this study, may have important roles in floral organ identity or flower developments.

in addition, these eight mirnas are evolutionary conserved and abundantly expressed mirnas in roses. according to previous studies, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are evolutionary conserved in all land plants, and mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are conserved in seed-bearing plants  <cit> . evolutionarily conserved mirnas in plants tend to regulate ancestral transcription factors that specify basic meristem functions, organ polarity and separation, cell division, or hormonal control . based on experimental validation of conserved mirnas and the current discussions  <cit> , we might expect that novel and un-validated mirnas identified in this study  possibly play important roles such as flower development or hormonal control. our analysis suggests that the rose database is a useful tool to search for candidate target transcripts or mirnas that play roles in flower development in rose and for those have a variety of other specific functions.

flower colour in most angiosperms is one of the most important targets for plant breeders and many different-coloured cultivars have been bred using natural mutants or genetically-related species. flower colours are determined by an accumulation of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, carotenoids, and betalains  <cit> . we examined mirna profiles in which target genes were involved in colour-metabolite related biosynthesis pathways to gain insight into the regulation of the white flowered cultivar, maroussia , which seems to be regulated by mirnas . we hypothesized that mirna enrichment in maroussia may negatively regulate the colour-related genes, leading to white colour of maroussia. although mirna enrichments were also observed in other rosa , the most interesting thing was that five mirna tags were enriched in maroussia. especially, mir356e was expressed up to five times more than other rosa. thus, the function of its target, cyp, which involves catalyzing the biosynthesis of flavonoids and cyanidin  and delphinidin   <cit> , would be more negatively regulated in maroussia, which may possibly lead to lack of colour . unfortunately, we were not able to validate mirna-directed cleavage of these targets due to high penalty score of the target genes . however, we would rather expect that mirna-directed regulation of target gene possibly lead to low read counts of target genes  in the transcriptome library, which makes target identification more challenging.

however, previous studies reported that two transcription factors, spl and r2r3-myb, both of which regulate expression of antocyanins-related genes. moreover, over-expressed mir <dig> directly prevent the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes  by targeting spl <dig>  in arabidopsis <cit> . in this study, we identified nine mir <dig> members from all rosa , and their target genes, spl transcription factors, were experimentally validated by 5’ race assay . the mir <dig> were among the most frequent in our library  and its sequencing frequencies were  <dig> to  <dig> times more than other relatively abundant mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> . along with this, it has been previously reported that differential expression of r2r3-myb gene determine colour patterning in plants that are linked with anthocyanin production  <cit> . given the fact that the mir <dig> is very highly expressed in rosa and mir159-directed cleavage of r2r3-myb gene is confirmed using 5' race, our results raise an intriguing possibility that mirnas in roses may be involved in pigment synthesis pathway. in addition, mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  which are also involved in r2r3-myb regulation <cit>  was predicted target myb genes in rosa .

based on the mirna profiles  and the previous research, flower colour seems to be regulated by combinatorial mechanisms. therefore, it is difficult to elucidate the molecular mechanism or mirna-directed regulation of colour determinacy of rosa flowers. nevertheless, mirna profiles give potential clues to examine the colour of rosa flowers. moreover, there are limited numbers of unigenes currently available. therefore, we would expect to reveal more direct evidence of mirna-mediated regulation of colour development in rosa when genome resources become more available.

in addition to the mirna profiles, we also compared the expression profiles of colour-related transcripts in rosa and rosaceae families . it shows that maroussia contains less number of unigenes  than other rosa cultivars. the higher number of colour-related gene in apple arose by current whole genome duplication  <cit> . in addition, the average number of reads per gene in maroussia was also smaller than other rosa cultivars because all of them were singlets . on the whole, based on expression profiles of mirna and the smaller number of transcripts involved in colour-metabolite related biosynthesis in maroussia, it is possible to expect that colour-related genes are systemically repressed in maroussia.

CONCLUSIONS
the rose database is the first database that allows for the comparison of transcripts and mirnas for the flowers of rosa hybrida and haedang, containing more than  <dig>  transcript sequences for each rose and more than  <dig> conserved and novel mirnas with high quality annotations. these data and analysis are available at http:// <dig> . <dig> /rose/. we identified several mirna families that are conserved and highly expressed in four rosa, including novel mirnas. we also present preliminary data which raises intriguing possibilities of mirna-directed regulation in the white colouration of the maroussia flower. our study demonstrates that the rose database may facilitate a comprehensive understanding of rose flower development, and is a valuable genetic resource for the analysis of gene functions and regulatory pathways that determine flower phenotypes.
