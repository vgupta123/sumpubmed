BACKGROUND
the aids-related protist parasite cryptosporidium parvum primarily infects the microvillous border of the intestinal epithelium, and to a lesser extent extraintestinal epithelia, causing acute gastrointestinal disease in a wide range of mammalian hosts. the first case of human cryptosporidium infection was reported in  <dig>  <cit> , and only seven additional cases were documented before  <dig>  <cit> . since then the number of cases identified has increased dramatically, largely due to the recognition of a life-threatening form of infection in immunocompromised individuals  <cit> . cryptosporidium was also recently implicated as a significant pathogen contributing to moderate-to-severe diarrhea in children under two years of age in sub-saharan africa, second only to rotavirus  <cit> . seroprevalence rates of 25-35% in the united states indicate that infection with cryptosporidium is very common among healthy persons  <cit> .

c. parvum has a complex, obligate-intracellular life cycle involving both asexual and sexual developmental stages. transmission of cryptosporidium occurs through the fecal-oral route where an infection is initiated by the ingestion of oocysts, which release sporozoites capable of invading intestinal epithelial cells. the parasite’s obligate intracellular developmental stages are exceedingly difficult to study. the volume of parasite material relative to host cell is vanishingly small. each parasite is  <dig> μm or smaller  in a host cell that is a hundred to thousand times larger in volume. given these complications of size, the post-infection parasite cannot be isolated from host cells in sufficient numbers, nor can sufficient post-infection parasite protein or rna be obtained for most downstream molecular applications. currently, c. parvum is not amenable to continuous in vitro cultivation or genetic dissection  <cit> .

given the above-mentioned difficulties, transcriptional regulation in this parasite is largely unknown. indeed, transcriptional regulation across the entire apicomplexan phylum is still poorly understood, though the combination of computational and bench analyses have yielded significant discoveries in the distantly related parasites plasmodium falciparum and toxoplasma gondii. genome-wide scans of the phylum for proteins containing possible dna-binding domains revealed several families of dna-binding proteins including a significant expansion of the apicomplexan ap <dig>  family of transcriptional regulators  <cit> . subsequent experimental analyses confirmed regulatory roles for several of these apiap <dig> proteins  <cit> . campbell et al.   <cit>  determined dna-binding specificities for 20/ <dig> identified members of this family in p. falciparum by generating recombinant apiap <dig> proteins and testing them on protein-binding microarrays   <cit> . these experiments identified binding site sequences matching several previously determined plasmodium cis-elements. militello et al.  computationally predicted a cis-regulatory element in the upstream sequences of 8/ <dig> p. falciparum heat shock genes  and subsequently demonstrated the importance of this element through transient transfections and mutational analyses  <cit> . similarly, young et al.  predicted several cis regulatory elements upstream of plasmodium genes clustered based on similarity of gene expression profile  and demonstrated the regulatory importance of one of the predicted elements  in vitro <cit> . elemento et al.  developed a powerful bioinformatic approach taking advantage of mutual information  to predict several additional putative cis-regulatory elements  <cit> . the fact that campbell et al.  could identify specific trans factors that bound many of these motifs  <cit>  confirms the power of computational methods to predict cis-regulatory elements in plasmodium.

computational methods have been used successfully to predict regulatory elements across the apicomplexan phylum, though unlike in plasmodium we rarely know which, if any, trans factors bind these elements. in toxoplasma gondii, mullapudi et al.  identified putative cis-regulatory elements present upstream of functionally related groups of genes and subsequently characterized the function of some of these conserved elements using reporter assays in the parasite  <cit> . behnke et al.  used t. gondii tachyzoite gene expression profiles to predict regulatory elements in their upstream sequences  <cit> . guo and silva  mined the non-coding sequences in two theileria genomes and predicted the presence of five putative cis-regulatory elements  <cit> . two previous studies characterized putative regulatory elements in upstream sequences in c. parvum. they grouped genes based on function and looked for conserved dna motifs in the promoter regions, then correlated these conserved motifs with the rt-pcr expression profiles of the genes examined  <cit> . many of these classical techniques for the experimental analysis of promoters and gene expression are not feasible in c. parvum. alternate approaches are required. the availability of several genome sequences  <cit>  enabled the design of primers and the quantification of expression for each gene using semi-quantitative-rt-pcr  <cit> . these transcriptome data lay a foundation for inference of gene regulatory mechanisms since they can be used in conjunction with the genome sequence to identify putative cis-acting promoter elements.

we utilize expression profiles from a study that generated whole genome expression data for c. parvum using semi-quantitative realtime-pcr of rna from seven post-infection time points  <cit> . out of  <dig>  annotated protein-encoding genes, expression data were generated for  <dig> . we standardized these data and clustered gene expression profiles using fuzzy c-means  clustering. we identified groups of genes with similar expression patterns throughout the first  <dig> hours of the intracellular life cycle in hct- <dig> epithelial cell culture. we used motif-finding algorithms to identify conserved, overrepresented dna motifs in the upstream region of genes with very similar expression profiles. a recombinant c. parvum dna-binding protein domain from a putative apiap <dig> transcription factor  was generated and tested on pbms to determine its binding specificity. we demonstrate that cgd8_ <dig> can putatively bind an overrepresented g-box motif, providing support for our methods and potentially implicating this apiap <dig> protein in the regulation of many gene clusters. we additionally investigate cryptosporidium-specific functionally related genes , genes found to be co-regulated in other organisms , or genes related by peak expression . we find that each of these groups of genes often appear in the same or similar clusters and share conserved upstream motifs, providing further support for the biological relevance of the identified motifs.

RESULTS
real time pcr gene expression data
normalized relative transcript abundance data for  <dig>  genes  were standardized as described in materials and methods. expression profiles for all  <dig>  genes were sorted according to peak expression at each time point . there is a cascade of tightly regulated expression across the 72-hour intracellular life cycle of c. parvum.

identification of co-expressed genes using cluster analysis
the underlying assumption of putative cis-regulatory element discovery is that many co-expressed genes  are likely controlled by common regulatory elements. in order to identify tightly clustered groups of co-expressed genes, two clustering algorithms, hopach and fcm, were implemented using the normalized and standardized semi-quantitative real time pcr expression data. to identify putative cis-regulatory elements for these clusters, we searched the upstream regions of all genes in a group/cluster for conserved, overrepresented sequence motifs. one of the major challenges in cluster analysis is determination of the number of clusters present in a given dataset. most clustering methods are restricted to a one-to-one mapping scheme where one gene is assigned to only a single cluster, known as hard clustering  and hierarchical clustering), while soft clustering  can assign genes with a metrics  value indicating the strength of its association with a cluster . moreover, it is important to have tight clusters of gene profiles that are strongly associated with each other to be most informative for the identification of putative cis-regulatory elements. the fcm “fuzzification” parameter, m, determines the influence of noise  on the cluster analysis. for m= <dig>  fcm will be equivalent to k-means clustering. increasing m reduces the influence of genes with low membership values, which are most likely those genes that are only loosely associated with a cluster. one can assess the stability of clusters by tracking the variation of membership values as m and cluster number are increased. considering inherent biological properties of gene expression as well as the importance of identifying tight and stable clusters, soft clustering using fcm is the most appropriate method for this study.

determination of the optimal fcm parameter set
estimation of the appropriate values for the two major parameters, c and m, is crucial to identifying appropriate clusters . our initial effort to determine the optimal number of clusters using hopach cluster analysis resulted in  <dig> main clusters, of which  <dig> clusters contained more than two genes . results of additional fcm clustering by increasing c and m are also shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  for all analyses with minimal m, m= <dig> , almost all genes were included in the constructed clusters, particularly for c= <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this is equivalent to hard clustering, and false positives in clusters are more likely. the highest membership values were obtained for the analysis with m= <dig>  and increasing values of c, where there were corresponding increments in the overall membership values. as m was increased, the number of genes included in clusters decreased . there is also a gradual reduction in the overall average of the membership value for each fcm analysis as m increases, indicating fuzzification influences the membership values of genes, and genes with highly similar profiles that form stable clusters will be least affected as m is increased. for smaller c values, there were larger cluster sizes, but as c was increased those main clusters split into smaller clusters . an ideal parameter set allows sufficient fuzzification while also including an optimal number of genes in the analysis. by tracking the number of genes included in clusters and the range of cluster sizes for each of the fcm cluster analyses , we estimated the ideal parameter set would be one of the four combinations of m =  <dig>  or  <dig> , and c =  <dig> or  <dig>  in order to fix the optimal parameter set, we looked for the significant presence of the core motifs of three previously predicted c. parvum cis-regulatory elements  <cit>  in the upstream sequences of the genes clustered by the four possible fcm analyses. we performed meme analysis on the upstream sequences of all clusters  and tracked the number of clusters with significant presence of the three core motifs . the parameter set m= <dig>  &c= <dig> produced the most clusters wherein all three core motifs were conserved and overrepresented in upstream regions relative to other fcm parameter combinations. c. parvum has  <dig>  annotated protein-encoding genes. using this final parameter set, we were able to cluster  <dig>  of the  <dig>  genes for which we had expression data, or  <dig> % of the genome, into the  <dig> clusters . cluster sizes range from  <dig> to  <dig> genes , with the majority of clusters  having between  <dig> and  <dig> genes.

all  <dig> expression profiles generated using fcm cluster analysis were sorted by peak expression at each time point and are displayed in heatmap format, where each row represents a cluster . representative expression profiles for each of these clusters closely recapitulate the tightly regulated expression cascade of all  <dig>  genes across the 72-hour intracellular life cycle of c. parvum , with some differences; gene expression patterns can be more easily discerned among the  <dig> clusters, particularly those with multiple peaks in expression. gene ids for all genes associated with each cluster can be found in additional file 1: table s <dig>  seventy-four clusters showed at least one biological process go term enrichment based on the hypergeometric statistical test. not all genes have predicted go terms, which explains the limited number of clusters with significant go term enrichment. this reflects the lack of available experimental data in c. parvum relative to other apicomplexan parasites. we predicted at least one conserved and significantly over represented dna motif in the upstream regions of genes in  <dig> of  <dig> clusters.

determination of a putative transcription factor binding site
two n-terminal gst-tagged apiap <dig> protein domains  were produced as described previously  <cit>  and tested on protein-binding microarrays to determine their binding specificities. protein-binding microarrays, composed of chips dotted with all possible double-stranded dna 10-mers, are able to determine transcription factor binding specificity with great accuracy, with results comparable to in vivo-determined binding specificities  <cit> . as previously documented, the apiap <dig> domain cgd2_ <dig> binds the palindromic site 5′-gcatgc-3′, confirming our methods. our predicted apiap <dig> cgd8_ <dig> binds the motif 5′-g.gggg-3′, referred to as the g-box, which is discussed in detail below. these data represent the second experimentally determined putative transcription factor binding preference for a c. parvum protein.

conserved dna sequence motifs and their possible biological relevance
using three de novo pattern-finding algorithms, meme, alignace and fire, we mined the upstream region of all genes present in each of the  <dig> identified clusters. twenty-five statistically significant conserved motifs were identified by at least one of the three algorithms . all three pattern-finding algorithms identified motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while only meme and alignace identified motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  motifs  <dig> to  <dig> were identified by fire alone. in the case where multiple algorithms identified a motif, meme counts of genes and clusters possessing the motif are used for the purpose of presentation. motif identification statistics from all algorithms are reported in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

iupac codes are used to represent each motif. the algorithm that identified each motif are indicated, as well as the number of clusters containing the overrepresented upstream motif.

overrepresented motif families
we further grouped the  <dig> identified motifs into  <dig> motif families based on sequence similarity . motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are highly similar to the palindromic apiap <dig> binding site 5′-gcatgca-3′, a well-documented motif in apicomplexa. we have designated it “ap2_1”. the ap2_ <dig> motif was previously noted to be overrepresented in the non-coding regions of c. parvum in a study of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . it was also previously identified as a potential cis-regulatory element in c. parvum <cit>  in the upstream sequences of a subset of glycolysis pathway genes. de silva et al.  showed that orthologous apiap <dig> proteins from p. falciparum  and c. parvum  both bind the 5′-tgcatgca-3′ core sequence  <cit> . the ap2_ <dig> motif is known to be enriched upstream of p. falciparum sporozoite-specific genes, which suggested a role in sporozoite-specific transcriptional regulation  <cit> . yuda et al.  subsequently proved that the plasmodium berghei ortholog of apiap <dig> pf14_ <dig>  binds the ap2_ <dig> motif and is essential for regulation of sporozoite-specific genes  <cit> . outside the plasmodia, this motif is also overrepresented in the non-coding regions of other apicomplexan parasites, including t. gondii   <cit>  and e. tenella <cit> . in this study,  <dig> clusters of co-expressed genes  were predicted to have statistically significant overrepresentation of the ap2_ <dig> motif in the upstream regions of their genes . the majority of these clusters have lower levels of expression at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hr post-infection. we investigated the possible biological relevance of these gene clusters using hypergeometric tests for biological process go term enrichment. glycolysis, cellular polysaccharide metabolic process, carbohydrate metabolism, post-translational protein modification, protein phosphorylation and regulation of biological quality are all significantly enriched.

motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  are very similar to the g-box motif previously reported in c. parvum in the upstream region of a subset of genes involved in dna metabolism, as well as 8/ <dig> p. falciparum heat shock genes and 11/ <dig> c. parvum heat shock genes  <cit> . expression profiles were available for  <dig> out of the  <dig> c. parvum heat shock genes, and they grouped into nine different clusters. the g-box motif was significantly overrepresented upstream of the genes in only two of those clusters . promoter regions of the genes contained in the remaining clusters contained g-box motifs, but their presence was not statistically significant within their respective clusters. pbm results for putative c. parvum apiap <dig> transcription factor cgd8_ <dig> indicate it binds the g-box motif. g-box-like motifs are overrepresented in the upstream sequences of  <dig> c. parvum gene expression clusters  , and again we note that these clusters are for the most part not active  <dig> hr post-infection. some of the go terms enriched in these gene clusters are dna packaging, nucleosome organization, organophosphate metabolic process, alcohol metabolic process, mrna metabolic process, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, phospholipid biosynthetic process, membrane lipid biosynthetic process and dna metabolism. of the  <dig> clusters containing g-box-like motifs in their upstream sequences,  <dig> clusters also have ap2_1-like motifs, suggesting the possibility of joint involvement in regulation of these genes .

motif  <dig>  and motif  <dig>  are highly similar to the binding site of the e2f-dp transcription factor, which represents an important class of tfs that function as major regulators of the cell cycle and apoptosis  <cit> . e2f transcription factors have been studied extensively in a broad range of organisms, such as mammals  <cit> , worm  <cit> , frog  <cit> , fly  <cit>  and plants  <cit> . the e2f family is comprised of two subfamilies: e2f and dp. one member of each subgroup partners to form a heterodimeric complex that binds to the promoter of a multitude of target genes. the e2f motif was previously noted to be overrepresented in the non-coding regions of c. parvum chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , though it was not identified as an e2f motif. the typical conserved sequence of the e2f/dp binding site is  <dig> bp in length, which consists of a  <dig> bp cg core flanked by t- and a-enriched sequence. this conserved central cg motif  is symmetric, and amino acids that contact these bases are conserved amongst all known e2f and dp proteins  <cit> . ramirez-parra et al.  found that consensus motifs 5′-tttcccgcc-3′ and 5′-tttggcggg-3′ are the most abundant motifs in the arabidopsis genome, and these sites were previously shown to be able to direct binding of e2f/dp  <cit> . in c. parvum, templeton et al.  reported the existence of two e2f/dp winged-helix dna-binding domain transcription factor pairs not found in p. falciparum <cit> . however, the specific roles these transcription factors play in c. parvum are unknown. in fly, worm and mammals, e2f transcription factors have been shown to form complexes with members of the retinoblastoma protein family  as well as myb and other proteins to regulate cell cycle progression . prb acts as a repressor of e2f-directed cell proliferation; prb has been found to be inactivated in many cancers . no c. parvum  orthologs to prb proteins and most other protein components of the complex are contained in the orthomcl database , with the exception of d. melanogaster rpd <dig> and c. elegans lin- <dig>  e2f motifs are overrepresented upstream of genes present in 163/ <dig> clusters , making e2f-like motifs the most abundant putative transcription factor binding sites in c. parvum . clusters containing overrepresented e2f-like motifs in their upstream regions do not show any particular expression patterns and genes with peak expression can be observed at all examined time points. c. parvum possesses three putative e2f transcription factors and two dp <dig> binding partners . expression data is available for two of the three e2f transcription factors and both dp <dig> binding partners, and all are maximally expressed at  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-infection, though they are expressed at some level at all time points  <cit> . of the  <dig> clusters containing overrepresented e2f motifs maximally expressed at  <dig> hours, 45% have e2f as the only overrepresented upstream motif. this finding suggests that e2f regulation could be sufficient to drive expression of this subset of clusters. as described in the materials and methods, go enrichment analysis revealed that clusters having overrepresented e2f motifs are statistically enriched for a number of biological processes, including structure-specific dna binding, gene expression, translation, dna metabolic process, response to dna damage stimulus, dna repair, regulation of nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process, rna processing, rna binding, ribonucleoprotein assembly, nucleocytoplasmic transport, golgi vesicle transport, cell redox homeostasis, establishment of protein localization to lipids, secretion by cell, lipid transport, carbohydrate transport and glycolysis. e2f-like motifs have previously been found to be overrepresented in c. parvum at the promoter regions of subsets of genes associated with dna replication and glycolysis  <cit> .

domains commonly associated with transcription factors and their counts in c. parvum as determined by text searches at cryptodb.org. apiap <dig> protein counts determined using custom-built hmms. *presence of several of these domains, particularly the c2h <dig> zinc finger and myb, do not necessarily indicate the protein acts as a transcription factor.

motif  <dig>  with the a-rich core 5′-aacta-3′, is the second-most overrepresented motif in the upstream regions of the genome, found upstream of  <dig>  of the  <dig>  genes in  <dig> of  <dig> clusters. it does not have significant similarity to known regulatory motifs. these clusters are maximally expressed at any of the seven time points . this motif appears in conjunction with many different motifs upstream of clusters with very different expression profiles . unknown motif  <dig> can occur on either strand, at any coordinate in the upstream region, anywhere from one to eight times per upstream region. the ubiquity of this motif and the wide variation between combinations of motifs and expression profiles makes it very difficult to attribute any particular expression pattern to motif  <dig> 

the remaining  <dig> motifs fall into various families that do not appear to be significantly similar to known regulatory motifs and are discussed in additional file  <dig> 

evidence for biological relevance of select clusters and motifs
ribosomal proteins
identification of overrepresented motifs upstream of genes that cluster by expression profile gives us a global view of potentially co-regulated genes. to investigate potentially co-regulated genes on a more targeted scale , we examined several groups of functionally-related genes or genes expressed at a specific point in time, starting with ribosomal proteins. we examined expression data for  <dig> of c. parvum’s  <dig> predicted ribosomal proteins  and compared them to  <dig> p. falciparum ribosomal proteins expressed during the intraerythrocytic cycle . sixty of  <dig> c. parvum ribosomal proteins clustered into  <dig> groups; eight had expression profiles too dissimilar to be clustered. sixty-three percent of clustered ribosomal proteins fall into five clusters . the majority of ribosomal proteins have a bimodal expression pattern, peaking at both  <dig> and   <dig> hours, corresponding to stages in the life cycle thought to be translationally active in the production of trophozoites and type  <dig> merozoites  <cit> . ribosomal proteins have been documented to be tightly co-regulated in other organisms such as yeast  <cit>  and to be stage-specifically regulated in the apicomplexan eimeria tenella <cit> . though we see more variability in ribosomal protein expression in cryptosporidium in terms of the number of clusters, expression of these proteins still appears in clusters.

upstream regions of  <dig> co-expressed p. falciparum ribosomal protein genes  as well as  <dig> clustered c. parvum ribosomal protein genes were mined for overrepresented motifs using meme. we confirm the presence of the g-box motif that was previously noted upstream of p. falciparum ribosomal proteins   <cit> . upstream sequence analysis of this subset of c. parvum ribosomal proteins indicates that e2f-like and gaga-like motifs are overrepresented . campbell et al.  identified the g-box binding apiap <dig> transcription factor pf13_ <dig> as the putative regulator of p. falciparum ribosomal proteins  <cit> , noting that the mrna expression profiles of this protein correlated very tightly with ribosomal protein expression. the g-box motif is also conserved upstream of three other plasmodium species’ ribosomal genes, as well as piroplasm ribosomal genes  <cit> . the putative e2f transcription factor expression profiles do not closely correlate with the expression of these c. parvum ribosomal proteins, though e2fs are expressed at some level at all time points. there are no predicted trans factors for the gaga-like motif in c. parvum.

cryptosporidium oocyst wall proteins 
cowp genes have two distinct expression profiles: four cowp genes have peak expression at  <dig> hours with a decline at  <dig> hours, which we have termed class i; and five genes with expression increasing steadily from  <dig> hours to peak at  <dig> hours, class ii . though subclasses of cowps have not been previously described, the expression data utilized in this study generally agree with what has previously been shown for cowps  <cit>  with the exception of cowp <dig> and cowp <dig>  which both belong to class i according to the mauzy dataset  <cit>  but belong to class ii according to the templeton dataset  <cit> . three e2f-like motifs, one gaga-like motif and one motif with the consensus 5′-gcacac-3′, similar to several p. falciparum apiap <dig> binding sites as well as the binding site for a recently characterized t. gondii apiap <dig> which acts as a repressor  <cit>  are overrepresented upstream of class i cowp genes . we have designated 5′-gcacac-3′ as ap2_ <dig>  class ii cowp genes share the e2f motif but otherwise have very different motifs: ap2_1-like motifs, a ccaat-box-like motif, and an unknown motif with the consensus 5′-aggga.a-3′ which is not similar to any of our  <dig> overrepresented motif families . mass spectroscopy data has also indicated five other possible oocyst wall proteins  present in trace amounts in excysted, purified oocyst walls  <cit> . expression profiles for these five proteins also fall into our two proposed classes, with powp <dig>  powp <dig> and powp <dig> falling into class i, and powp <dig> and powp <dig> falling into class ii .

transcripts peaking at  <dig> hours post-infection
c. parvum in vitro parasite growth fails somewhere from  <dig> to  <dig> hours post-infection. following completion of the formation of type  <dig> meronts at 24– <dig> hours and the release and reinvasion of type  <dig> meronts into new cells, development can occur along two pathways: an asexual round of replication can lead to more type  <dig> meronts, or some parasites will form type  <dig> merozoites that upon release  will form the sexual stages of the parasite. type  <dig> and type  <dig> merozoites are morphologically indistinguishable by light microscopy  <cit> . while gametocytes are occasionally seen in in vitro culture, oocysts are never observed and parasite development stops. we examined the three clusters which peaked only at  <dig> hours  to examine what they may indicate about parasite biology at this critical time point . no go-terms are over-enriched for genes in clusters  <dig> or  <dig>  though genes involved in proteolysis and carbohydrate metabolic processes are over-enriched in cluster  <dig>  ap2_1-like, e2f-like, ap2_2-like and g-box-like motifs are over-enriched upstream of genes in these three clusters . apiap <dig> gene cgd2_ <dig>  which is ap2_1-binding, is maximally expressed at  <dig> hours post-infection, as is the g-box-binding apiap <dig> cgd8_ <dig>  no ap2_2-like binding proteins have been identified in c. parvum, but it is reasonable to believe that apiap2s orthologous to the cacaca-binding apiap2s in p. falciparum could also bind this motif, given the conservation of binding sites found between another p. falciparum/c. parvum apiap <dig> ortholog pair  <cit> . the finding that 3/ <dig> of the overrepresented motifs upstream of these late-peaking genes are potential apiap <dig> binding sites suggests that apiap <dig> proteins are important regulators in the later stages of the parasite’s intracellular life cycle.

discussion
little is known about transcriptional regulation in apicomplexans in general and cryptosporidium in particular, though recent studies in plasmodium and t. gondii have begun to reveal the tremendous complexity of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in these parasites  <cit> . in this study, we have used bioinformatics approaches to analyze available c. parvum transcriptome data and genome sequence to advance our understanding of possible regulatory mechanisms in this experimentally intractable parasite.

clustering of gene expression profiles is often used to reveal patterns of gene regulation. such analyses provide valuable information regarding which genes are expressed at a particular time in the life cycle. mauzy et al.  used the diana algorithm available in the “cluster” package in r  <cit>  to cluster  <dig>  c. parvum genes into nine groups based on similarity of expression profile  <cit> . these large clusters, consisting for the most part of hundreds of genes each, allowed them to observe general functional trends for genes expressed at each stage of the life cycle. among their findings, they note that transcripts expressed at each time point make biological sense in the context of what is known about c. parvum biology at each of the examined life cycle stages. for example, genes involved in protein synthesis and degradation, nutrient availability, and ribosome biogenesis are highly expressed in the trophozoite stage , where the parasite is growing, absorbing nutrients and preparing for the first round of cell division. while these observations are certainly useful for a global understanding of the c. parvum transcriptome and validation of the dataset, the hundreds of genes found in each of these clusters are not likely to be truly co-regulated in the organism, and the entire diversity of c. parvum gene expression profiles  cannot be captured in only nine gene expression clusters.

we have clustered  <dig>  c. parvum genes into  <dig> putatively co-regulated clusters based on their expression profiles. many lines of evidence support the biological relevance of many of these clusters, namely:  expression profiles within each cluster are well-correlated, and there are statistically significant overrepresented motifs upstream of the genes comprising  <dig> of  <dig> clusters;  identified overrepresented motifs fall into  <dig> motif families, many of which could potentially be bound by known c. parvum transcription factors, as well as one previously unknown g-box-binding apiap <dig> transcription factor, cgd8_810; and  the two examples of functionally related and known co-expressed genes  are clustered.

though functionally related genes, or genes known to be co-expressed in other organisms were often clustered together, there are instances where these genes fall into disparate clusters in c. parvum. the 11/ <dig> heat shock proteins for which expression data are available grouped into  <dig> different clusters, yet all share the g-box motif. the g-box is unlikely to be the only motif contributing to regulation of these genes; combinatorial transcriptional regulation, or other mechanisms such as epigenetic regulation prior to transcription may be involved to produce these different expression patterns. the ap2_ <dig> motif is not found overrepresented upstream of any individual cluster, but when we group several clusters  or functionally related genes  together, this motif is statistically overrepresented. these observations indicate that the  <dig> clusters we identified may be finer-scale or overly divided relative to larger overall patterns or not indicative of truly co-regulated genes. it may be the case that some of the identified clusters can be collapsed into larger clusters, and that we have overestimated the number of clusters. our fcm parameter exploration suggests that the true number of clusters is somewhere between  <dig> and  <dig>  with  <dig> producing the highest number of clusters with known regulatory elements conserved upstream. alternatively, it must also be considered that genes have been incorrectly assigned to clusters. as noted in mauzy et al. , c. parvum cultures cannot be synchronized beyond the first  <dig> hours post-infection. thus rna collected past this time point is a mix of life cycle stages, and gene expression profiles may begin to vary with unsynchronized parasite development in the culture. despite this possibility, we find that many clusters still exhibit tight co-expression at later time points , suggesting that culture asynchrony may not be a big problem. mauzy et al.  noted subsets of genes that are expressed at a single time point only. to investigate the earlier stages of development where culture asynchrony is not an issue, we examined the upstream regions of the  <dig> genes identified in mauzy et al. as being expressed only at  <dig> hours post-infection. all  <dig> genes were found in the same cluster . upstream motif analysis revealed overrepresented e2f and ap2_ <dig> motifs.

we observe e2f-like and gaga-like motifs conserved upstream of c. parvum ribosomal protein genes. the upstream regions of the ribosomal gene regulon have been examined in several other apicomplexans, and overrepresented motifs in the species examined are largely known apiap <dig> binding sites. t. gondii ribosomal proteins were found to have the ap2_1-like motif overrepresented upstream   <cit> ; essien et al. also reported conservation of this motif upstream of n. caninum ribosomal genes  <cit> . the apiap <dig> g-box motif is conserved upstream of four out of five examined plasmodium species’ ribosomal genes, as well as piroplasm ribosomal genes  <cit> . the overrepresentation of different motifs upstream of ribosomal protein regulons across the phylum raises the possibility that there have been multiple transcription factor substitutions in ribosomal protein transcriptional regulation over time. e2f/dp <dig> transcription factors can be traced back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor  <cit> , making it one of the oldest transcription factor families known, and cryptosporidium is the most basal-branching apicomplexan taxon for which we currently have a genome sequence  <cit> . it is therefore attractive to consider that e2f regulation of the ribosomal gene regulon is the ancestral state, with switches to, or between, various apiap <dig> transcription factors occurring over the course of apicomplexan evolution. given the extremely high level of breaks in synteny across the apicomplexa  <cit> , it is possible to imagine how coding regions can become associated with new and different regulatory regions.

we observe a disparity in the different types of motifs identified by the different algorithms; some motifs were identified by all algorithms, while other motifs were identified by only one or two algorithms. this finding is explained by the differences in these algorithms’ underlying assumptions. meme and alignace discover degenerate motif candidates using an expectation maximization strategy and gibbs sampling, respectively, from a set of sequences. fire uses model-independent mutual information and continuous  or discrete  data to identify motifs. due to the theoretical similarity behind the meme and alignace motif discovery methods, there should be a correlation between the motifs identified by them. this is exactly what we observed. the first six motifs  were identified by both meme and alignace. one of the possible limitations of fire is that it may overlook certain highly degenerate motifs, as it initially begins by searching non-degenerate motif representations  <cit> . perhaps for these reasons, fire did not identify motifs  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig>  nor was there a consensus between fire and the other two algorithms concerning all clusters identified as having overrepresentations of motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

many of the overrepresented motifs we identified are still of unknown function. likewise, the binding specificities of most of the putative c. parvum transcription factors are not known, particularly the many zinc finger and apiap <dig> proteins; these unknown motifs could represent binding sites for these transcription factor proteins. it is also a possibility that these motifs are not transcription factor binding sites; they might represent some other cis element important for other mechanisms of gene regulation, such as binding sites for proteins involved in epigenetic regulation. alternatively, it is possible that these motifs are not involved in gene regulation and represent some sort of repeat element. additional studies to elucidate binding sites for the remaining putative c. parvum transcription factors and dna-binding proteins coupled with experiments to determine their binding sites throughout the genome  are needed to distinguish between these possibilities. an additional complication to identifying cis-regulatory elements is that c. parvum utrs are largely undefined. apicomplexan cis-regulatory elements have traditionally been identified by looking in the 1-2 kb of sequence directly upstream of coding regions, or until a gene is encountered on either strand  <cit> ; however, there is some evidence that in highly compacted eukaryotic genomes, such as that of c. parvum, transcripts overlap, and utrs are not necessarily limited to intergenic spaces  <cit> . the extent of occurrences of overlapping transcripts in c. parvum has not been quantified. thus it is possible that the upstream sequence database we generated, and subsequently the motifs we identified, are not representative of what would be identified in the endogenous promoter. however, the finding that several known cis-regulatory elements are overrepresented in our upstream regions lends support that our motif-finding methodology is biologically relevant. strand-specific rna-seq data and epigenetic state information for cryptosporidium will reveal the utr sequences and open chromatin respectively and permit more accurate identification of endogenous promoters.

we also note that the e2f motif is particularly overrepresented throughout the upstream regions of the c. parvum genome. this is very interesting, given the absence of e2f/dp <dig> transcription factor proteins in other apicomplexans. it is an intriguing possibility that c. parvum is unusually reliant on a small number of e2f transcription factors for transcriptional regulation. most of the e2f-interacting proteins important for e2f-mediated transcriptional regulation identified in flies, worms and mammals are absent in c. parvum; however a few have been retained . e2f regulatory interactions may be different in c. parvum versus other well-studied organisms as a result. clusters containing overrepresented e2f motifs in the upstream regions of their genes are observed to have maximal expression at any of the seven post-infection time points. the two e2f genes for which we have expression data are expressed at some level at all time points, though e2f cgd1_ <dig> is maximally expressed at  <dig> hours post-infection, and e2f cgd6_ <dig> and both dp <dig> proteins are maximally expressed at  <dig> hours post-infection. e2f proteins could thus be available to regulate at all examined time points. however, the presence of the motif does not necessarily indicate that the transcription factor binds it. indeed, flueck et al.  recently concluded that p. falciparum apiap <dig> protein pff0200c  only binds instances of its motif that are located in subtelomeric heterochromatin in vivo <cit> . chip-seq experiments to determine whether or not most of these overrepresented motifs act as true e2f binding sites will help to elucidate the importance of e2f transcription factors in c. parvum transcriptional regulation.

our data suggest that in most cases, a single overrepresented motif is not sufficient to explain cluster expression patterns. a notable exception is in the case of e2f motif-containing clusters that peak at  <dig> hours post-infection, where the e2f motif is the only overrepresented motif detected upstream in 45% of these clusters. both e2f transcription factors and their dp <dig> dimerization partners are expressed at this time point and could possibly be driving expression of these clusters. however, peak expression at  <dig> hours post-infection is not so easily explained, and the presence of the e2f motif is not the only determinant of peak expression at  <dig> hours post-infection; clusters containing any of our identified overrepresented motifs can peak at this time. another 45% of e2f-motif-containing clusters also have unknown motif  <dig> overrepresented upstream. unknown motif  <dig> can occur on either strand, at any coordinate in the upstream region, anywhere from one to eight times per upstream region. given these variable characteristics and the abundance of unknown motif  <dig>  it is an attractive possibility that this motif is a general transcription factor binding site; future chip-seq experiments, if and when they become technically feasible, will help to determine the function of unknown motif  <dig>  at this time, the ubiquity of this motif in regions upstream of clusters having a wide variety of expression patterns makes the influence it has on gene expression, if any, very difficult to decipher. we see any manner of combinations of motifs overrepresented upstream of clusters with highly variable expression patterns, which suggests a very complicated interplay between motifs and transcription factors that act together to determine these intricate and precise expression patterns. the variable orientation, spacing, and overall number of overrepresented motifs upstream of clusters all need to be considered to understand c. parvum transcriptional regulation.

functionally related or known co-expressed genes appear together in clusters in the case of ribosomal proteins and cowp genes. clustering further allowed us to distinguish between two potentially co-regulated classes of cowp: class i, which peaks at  <dig> hours, then declines; and class ii, which rises steadily from  <dig> hours to peak at  <dig> hours. the e2f binding motif  is overrepresented upstream of class i cowps, while a known apiap <dig> binding site  is overrepresented upstream of class ii. it is possible that this differential regulation indicates functional differences between the two classes of cowp. it should be noted that the expression data for cowps utilized in our study differ slightly from what has previously been described  <cit> . the gene membership between class i and class ii differs slightly between datasets, with cowp <dig> and cowp <dig> changing classes. despite these differences, both datasets suggest two differentially regulated classes of cowps. electron microscopy data indicate that the c. parvum thick-walled oocyst is divided into three layers: a ~ <dig> nm outer layer, sometimes referred to as the outer veil  <cit> ; a rigid, sds- and protease-resistant  <dig>  nm electron-lucent middle layer that is largely uncharacterized; and a thick, multi-zoned inner layer of  <dig>  nm  <cit> . no mechanism has yet been indicated for how the oocyst wall is formed. protein localization data indicate that cowp <dig>  localizes to the inner oocyst wall  <cit> . an antibody to cowp <dig>  is only reactive to ruptured oocysts  <cit> , indicating this cowp is not expressed on the oocyst surface, but there is no precise localization data for cowp <dig>  to our knowledge no other cowp protein localization data are available. with these limited data, it is tempting to speculate that the earlier class of cowps represents components of the inner oocyst membrane, while the later-expressed class of cowps builds on this earlier structure to help form the remaining layers. mass spectroscopy data on excysted, purified oocyst walls without the outer veil indicate that cowp <dig>  cowp <dig> and cowp <dig> are the most abundant cowps in these parts of the oocyst wall, with cowp <dig>  cowp <dig> and cowp <dig> present in trace amounts. cowp <dig>  cowp <dig> and cowp <dig> were not detected at all  <cit> . chatterjee et al. also identify five other possible oocyst wall proteins  present in trace amounts in the mass spec data. expression profiles for these five proteins also fall into our two proposed classes, with powp <dig>  powp <dig> and powp <dig> falling into class i, and powp <dig> and powp <dig> falling into class ii. this is valuable information as to the composition of the oocyst wall, though these data do not conclusively indicate protein localization. future localization studies on the remaining cowps and all powps will help investigate the hypothesis that expression class is somehow related to role in oocyst wall structure.

CONCLUSIONS
bioinformatic approaches combined with experimental dna binding site determination for an apiap <dig> protein have allowed us to identify overrepresented upstream sequence motifs that are correlated with clustered gene expression profiles. this information allows us to postulate transcriptional mechanisms in c. parvum. we have generated testable hypotheses that will further elucidate regulatory mechanisms and other aspects of c. parvum biology.
