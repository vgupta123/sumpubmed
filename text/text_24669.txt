BACKGROUND
glucoamylase  is an exohydrolase that catalyzes the release of β-d-glucose by hydrolyzing α- <dig> - and α- <dig> -glucosidic linkages at the non-reducing ends of raw or soluble starches and related oligosaccharides  <cit> . ga has been used in industrial processes such as the production of glucose syrup and other food-processing applications  <cit> . although many fungal species are capable of producing ga under different growth conditions  <cit> , the industrial development of ga has focused only on ga from aspergillus niger  and rhizopus oryzae  because of their stability and high activity  <cit> . the overall domain structure of anga consists of an n-terminal catalytic region and a c-terminal starch-binding domain . in contrast, the organization of that of the roga consists of an n-terminal sbd and a c-terminal catalytic region. the biochemical properties of anga have been well characterized  <cit> , whereas less is known about roga  <cit> . this work focuses on functional analysis of roga.

roga is synthesized as a precursor containing a typical hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of  <dig> amino acids. the mature form of roga is a single-chain protein composed of three domains: an sbd , a thr/ser-rich linker region , and a catalytic domain   <cit> . the schematic representation of roga is shown in figure  <dig>  then-terminal sbd belongs to the carbohydrate-binding module  family  <dig> and shows a relatively low level of similarity to sbds in other starch-degrading enzymes  <cit> . the c-terminal catalytic domain of roga plays an active role in hydrolyzing starch and has a high degree of sequence similarity to those of other fungal gas  <cit> . the linker region between these two functional domains is rich in hydroxyl-amino acid residues, but information about its function is quite limited  <cit> . in the cazy classification based on amino acid sequences of the catalytic domain, gas are classified into glycoside hydrolase  family  <dig>  <cit> , and on two recently published articles  <cit> , the n-terminally positioned sbd  and the c-terminally positioned sbd  are classified to be grouped into a common cbm clan. however, the sequences of the linker regions are highly variable. comparison of the primary structures of different fungal gas reveals that the linker sequences vary greatly in length and composition .

in some fungal hydrolases, the substrate-binding and catalytic domains are separated by a linker segment rich in proline and hydroxy amino acid residues, some of which have been shown to be involved in various functions including enzymatic activity, stability, protein secretion, and ligand binding  <cit> . in anga, the heavily o-glycosylated linker domain is essential for secretion and is responsible for enzyme stability as well as activity toward raw starch  <cit> . aside from the knowledge that the linker region in roga acts as an interdomain spacer, very little is known about this specific sequence stretch. the linker region of roga contains high percentages of thr  and ser  residues. along with numerous putative o-glycosylation sites, the roga linker also contains one potential n-glycosylation site adjacent to the catalytic domain .

*genbank or genpept accession numbers are as follows: ro, rhizopus oryzae ; an, aspergillus niger ; hr, hormoconis resinae ; hg, humicola grisea ; mc, mucor circinelloides ; and nc, neurospora crassa .

here the baker's yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was used as a host system to study the structure and function of roga, with special attention to the interdomain linker region. the effects of the linker segment with specific length, composition, and glycosylation on the properties of the protein expression, ligand or substrate binding, enzyme activity and stability have been thoroughly investigated.

RESULTS
expression of the full-length and deletion mutant gas in s. cerevisiae
to investigate the function of the linker region of roga, several constructs containing full-length, truncated or partially deleted ga fragments were generated . all constructs used in this study contained a leader signal sequence of the n-terminal  <dig> residues of roga. when the full-length ga was expressed in s. cerevisiae, secreted enzyme activity was detected in the culture medium following incubation at 30°c . in contrast, removal of the interdomain 36-amino acid linker of roga  led to generation of a mutant with no detectable secreted ga as determined by plate assay or western blot analysis , suggesting that the linker played an important role in the function of roga. to further examine whether the linker region was essential for the formation of active starch-binding or catalytic domains, four deletion mutants devoid of either the substrate binding or catalytic domain in the presence or absence of the linker region were engineered to generate plasmids ps1-gaΔ168– <dig> encoding the sbd with the c-terminal linker region; ps1-gaΔ132– <dig> encoding the sbd alone; ps1-gaΔ26– <dig> encoding the linker region preceding the catalytic domain; and ps1-gaΔ26– <dig> encoding the catalytic domain only. it was found that two sbd-containing clones, one, gaΔ168– <dig>  containing the linker sequence and the other, gaΔ132– <dig>  without the linker sequence were both successfully expressed and secreted . since no effect was observed in the absence of the linker in both cases, the linker region appeared to be not essential for the formation and secretion of the sbd. as for the catalytic domain-containing variants, gaΔ26– <dig> was successfully expressed and secreted in yeast, but gaΔ26– <dig> lacking of the linker sequence was not expressed at all , indicating that the linker region was specifically required for formation and secretion of the catalytic domain. to further define which region in the linker was crucial for its role in facilitating formation and secretion of the catalytic domain, several constructs encoding partial deletions of the linker region fused to the catalytic domain were subsequently expressed and characterized. interestingly, both gaΔ26– <dig> and gaΔ26– <dig>  unlike gaΔ26– <dig>  were successfully expressed in secretory forms , indicating that the linker region from residues 161– <dig> was essential for in vivo folding and secretion of the active catalytic domain. it is of interest that a recently published article  <cit>  on rhizopus oryzar found a second ga gene, amyb, lacks the n-terminal sbd. the amyb gene contains the conserved residues in the catalytic domain important for starch hydrolysis, and the gene also contains a stretch of linker sequence  preceding the catalytic domain. this finding also indicates that the small region of linker plays an important role in function of roga.

characterization of recombinant gas
in order to characterize roga and to study the function of the linker region, the recombinant proteins including full-length ga, gaΔ168– <dig>  gaΔ132– <dig>  gaΔ26– <dig>  gaΔ26– <dig>  and gaΔ26– <dig> were individually expressed in the budding yeast s. cerevisiae and were grown in sd media at 30°c. extracellular  proteins were concentrated from culture supernatants and purified by cation-exchange chromatography. as shown in figure 3a, purified full-length ga, gaΔ168– <dig>  gaΔ132– <dig>  gaΔ26– <dig>  gaΔ26– <dig>  and gaΔ26– <dig> exhibited single protein bands with purity higher than 90%. sds-page and/or mass spectrometric determination revealed that the respective molecular mass of full-length ga, gaΔ168– <dig>  gaΔ132– <dig>  gaΔ26– <dig>  gaΔ26– <dig>  and gaΔ26– <dig> was approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda . the differences between the calculated and observed molecular weights ranged from 3% to 28%, indicating that post-translational modifications occurred in some of the recombinant proteins, presumably due to differential degree of glycosylation. there are two main types of protein glycosylation: n-glycosylation and o-glycosylation. the former refers to the attachment of oligosaccharides to a protein through the amide of asparagine residues, whereas the latter involves attachment of sugars to the hydroxyamino acids serine and threonine via their hydroxyl groups  <cit> . potential n-glycosylation sites in roga analyzed using the on-line prediction server netnglyc version  <dig>   <cit>  revealed that roga contained three putative n-linked glycosylation consensus sites, one  located in the linker region and two  in the catalytic domain . although no specific consensus sequence for o-linked glycosylation has yet been reported  <cit> , o-glycosylation may occur on any of the ser or thr residues within a short peptide region  <cit> . interestingly, the program netoglyc version  <dig>   <cit>  predicted that potential o-glycosylation sites in roga were clustered only in the linker region. of the residues in the 36-amino-acid linker region, 61% were ser and thr, among which some might serve as potential sites for o-linked glycosylation. maldi fingerprint mass spectrum from the tryptic digestion fragments of roga  also showed that no peptide fragment was mapped to the linker region, presumably due to the presence of heterogeneous glycosylation within this region.

*nd, not determined. †gaΔ26– <dig> displayed multiple mass spectral peaks ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. ‡gaΔ26– <dig> displayed multiple mass spectral peaks ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda.

to determine how much of the molecular weight discrepancy for each recombinant protein was derived from the addition of glycosyl groups, each protein was enzymatically deglycosylated by pngase f or jack bean α-mannosidase followed by sds-page analysis. pngase f is an amidase that cleaves between the innermost glcnac and the asparagine residue of complex n-linked oligosaccharides from glycoproteins  <cit> . the fully glycosylated roga possessed a molecular mass of  <dig> kda. after removal of n-linked carbohydrates with pngase f, its molecular mass was reduced to  <dig> kda , indicating that roga produced by s. cerevisiae was highly glycosylated and the n-linked carbohydrates contributed approximately  <dig> kda to the molecular weight. enzymatic deglycosylation of asparagine-linked glycans in the catalytic domain variants gaΔ26– <dig>  gaΔ26– <dig>  and gaΔ26– <dig> also showed that these proteins were efficiently glycosylated to various degrees .

the linker sequences code for a  <dig> amino acid extension at the c-terminal end of gaΔ168– <dig>  which correspond to a molecular mass of approximately  <dig>  kda. the difference in molecular mass between gaΔ168– <dig> and gaΔ132– <dig> was  <dig>  kda, implying that the linker region contributed to the hyperglycosylation in gaΔ168– <dig>  however, treatment of gaΔ132– <dig> and gaΔ168– <dig> with the n-glycan-specific pngase f did not reduce its apparent molecular weight; hence there seemed to be little or no n-glycosylation on either protein . at present, no enzyme comparable to pngase f is available for removing intact o-linked sugars  <cit> . in general, o-glycans are short linear oligosaccharides consisting of one to five mannose residues in yeast  <cit> . therefore, α-mannosidase, an exoglycosidase capable of removing terminal mannose, was used to treat the recombinant proteins. if o-linked carbohydrates were present, the overall mass of the protein would decrease after treatment with α-mannosidase. the sbd variant gaΔ132– <dig> did not respond to the treatment with α-mannosidase, such that no change was detected in the electrophoretic mobility , suggesting that no major o-glycosylation occurred in this case. on the other hand, a clear shift in the mobility of gaΔ168– <dig> was observed after treatment with α-mannosidase, indicating that presence of the linker region led to a considerable degree of modification by high-mannose-type o-glycans . taken together, our data indicate that the linker region of roga is modified by both n- and o-linked glycosylation, but the exact positions and functions are not clearly understood and require further investigation.

effects of mutations in the linker region of roga
the minimal active linker region ala <dig> to asn <dig> was previously demonstrated to be extremely important for ga function. in addition, n-terminal sequencing analysis of the gaΔ26– <dig> yielded the following sequence: ala161-thr162-phe163-pro164-xaa165-gly166-xaa <dig>  where xaa represented unidentified residues. generally speaking, biochemically modified amino acid residues were not identifiable by regular edman degradation; hence residues thr <dig> and asn <dig> were possibly modified after translation. to abolish the glycosylation and evaluate the consequence, thr <dig> and asn <dig> in the linker region were individually mutated to generate t165a and n167d, respectively, and their effects on protein secretion and enzymatic activity were examined at 30°c. t165a mutation showed no effect on the phenotype as compared with wild-type full-length ga , while a significant decrease in ga expression and function was observed in the n167d mutant . site-specific mutation at asn <dig> led to much less active ga secretion, presumably due to either misfolding of roga, or faster degradation of the nascent protein. in support of the misfolding hypothesis, several different methods were used to improve the production of the mutant ga, n167d. one evidence showed that n167d exhibited enhanced expression at 20°c , and about  <dig>  mg protein could be obtained from each liter of yeast culture at 20°c. the activity of the n167d mutant could also be detected directly on starch-agar plate with prolonged incubation at 4°c . similar phenomena were also observed for the mutants gaΔ132– <dig> and gaΔ26– <dig> after prolonged incubation at low temperature .

moreover, elimination of the n-glycosylation site at position asn <dig>  resulted in a faster relative electrophoretic mobility and lower apparent molecular weight , providing additional line of evidence that the only putative n-glycosylation site in the linker region, asn167-ser-thr, was indeed modified in s. cerevisiae. the biological function of carbohydrates in ga is not, however, completely understood, although it directs protein folding, facilitates secretion, and enhances stability of aspergillus gas  <cit> . in this study, we have demonstrated that n-glycosylation at asn <dig> in the linker is required for functional expression of roga, whereas mutation abolishing n-glycosylation in the linker, n167d, decreased the efficiency of protein expression. furthermore, similar result was obtained when asn <dig> was converted to gln . n-linked carbohydrates play important roles for a variety of structural and functional activities of glycoproteins  <cit> . here, we have characterized the n-glycans attached to the linker region of roga to be important for folding process, especially for its catalytic domain.

the starch-binding domain
the sbd, the non-catalytic module of ga that binds raw starch  <cit> , is found at the n terminus in roga and shares only  <dig> % identity with that of anga  <cit> . characterization of the key functional groups of this domain has been accomplished using sequence-based structure alignment and nmr spectroscopy  <cit> . the effects of the linker region on sbd adsorption on to insoluble starch were thus investigated. the binding assay was conducted at ph  <dig>  using insoluble corn-starch as the affinity matrix. figure  <dig> showed the binding isotherms for the interaction between corn-starch and the sbd variants . the binding isotherms were used to calculate binding parameters as described in the materials and methods section. the kd values for gaΔ132– <dig> and gaΔ168– <dig> were determined to be  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively; and the bmax values of gaΔ132– <dig> and gaΔ168– <dig> were measured as  <dig>  μmol/g and  <dig>  μmol/g, respectively. it was apparent that the 106-residue sbd, gaΔ132– <dig>  possessed stronger ligand affinity and higher capacity than those of the 142-residue sbd, gaΔ168– <dig>  indicating that the presence of the linker region in the sbd construct did not increase but instead slightly interfered with the raw starch-binding affinity. the difference in starch binding affinity between gaΔ132– <dig> and gaΔ168– <dig> might be due to higher sugar content in the linker region or steric hindrance caused by the linker tail. binding of the starch-degrading enzyme to its substrate is a critical step in starch hydrolysis because it involves the phase transfer of a soluble enzyme to the insoluble substrate  <cit> . in our case the linker sequence influences the binding of the sbd to starch, possibly by affecting the ligand transfer process.

the catalytic domain
ga activity was assayed by measuring the reducing sugar released from the reaction on starch. the standard assay was performed as previously described with minor modification  <cit> . the specific activities of the wild-type roga and the truncated mutants are listed in table  <dig>  full-length ga and gaΔ26– <dig> exhibited similar activities,  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/μmol and  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/μmol, respectively, indicating that the absence of the n-terminal sbd had little or no effect on the ability to digest soluble starch. moreover, comparison of the activities of the three catalytic domain variants gaΔ26– <dig>  gaΔ26– <dig> and gaΔ26– <dig> revealed that longer size of the linker region was correlated with enhanced catalytic activity.

*the data are expressed as the means ± sd.

structure analysis
the three-dimensional structure of roga is currently unavailable; circular dichroism spectroscopy has been widely used to study the secondary structure, with the goal of understanding the role of the linker in protein structure. in this study, the far-uv spectrum of full-length roga displayed two broad minima at  <dig> and  <dig> nm, characteristic of the presence of a mainly α-helical structure . the circular dichroism spectra of catalytic domain variants with different linker lengths were also indicative of a high content of helical conformation. in addition, the spectra of gaΔ26– <dig>  gaΔ26– <dig>  and gaΔ26– <dig> were very similar to each other, mainly differing in absorbance intensity . gaΔ26– <dig> possessed a higher fraction of ordered secondary structure than did the other mutants, suggesting that the linker sequence might increase the stability of the secondary structural motifs. it was thus concluded that the linker sequences or their high degree of glycosylation facilitated stabilization of conformation of the catalytic domain of roga.

as for the sbd, figure 7a also showed the calculated circular dichroism spectra of gaΔ132– <dig> and gaΔ168– <dig> . the negative ellipticity peak centered at  <dig> nm indicated that the secondary structure of the protein was predominantly β-sheet, but the latter showed a higher β-sheet conformation content. similar to the case for the catalytic domain variants, the presence of the linker peptide in the recombinant sbd induced a substantial conformational change to a more ordered state. in addition, the thermal denaturation of gaΔ132– <dig> and gaΔ168– <dig> was monitored by circular dichroism at  <dig> nm. figure 7b revealed that the denatured state of gaΔ168– <dig> possessed a greater negative ellipticity at  <dig> nm than did gaΔ132– <dig>  suggesting that the presence of linker sequence might induce the sbd to form a more compact structure at high temperature. taken together, although the 36-amino-acid linker alone of roga is predicted to be disordered, it strongly influences the structural ordering of the independent functional domains of roga.

CONCLUSIONS
many raw starch-degrading enzymes have a modular structure in which the functional domains are spatially separated by linker sequences. in anga, the highly o-glycosylated linker segment has been shown to be needed for the efficient digestion of raw starch  <cit> . in contrast, the raw starch-digesting α-amylase from the yeast cryptococcus sp. strain s- <dig>  lacking of a linker segment demonstrates that the linker region is not always essential for the discrete domains in raw starch-degrading enzymes to retain their proper function  <cit> . our present study focuses on functional characterization of the linker region of roga. the linker between the sbd and the catalytic domain consists of  <dig> amino acids with several oligosaccharides attached, and the region facilitates the formation of functional roga in s. cerevisiae. the gaΔ132– <dig> deletion mutant failed to produce detectable protein at 30°c, presumably because the distance between the two domains was too short for them to be folded and secreted correctly. interestingly, prolonged incubation at low temperature was allowed to synthesize the mutant, which showed detectable activity as visualized on starch plate , indicating that low temperature might work in concert to increase the de novo synthesis and stabilize correct folding of the mutant protein. in addition, our results show that the properties of two functional domains are influenced by the linker region. the linker sequence influences the substrate binding process, possibly in the substrate transfer step. analysis of the isolated catalytic domain shows that the formation of functional domain requires the linker region, especially the amino acid sequences from  <dig> to  <dig>  interestingly, the single n-glycosylation site within the linker domain, asn <dig>  is demonstrated to be extremely important for the function of roga. some glycoproteins need the n-glycans during synthesis for proper folding, sufficient for the efficient secretion or increased stability  <cit> . in this report, we have demonstrated that the n-linked oligomannosides in the linker region play an important role in expression of functional roga, however, the exact structures of the oligosaccharides attached to the linker segment remain to be further investigated.

prior to our present work, no three dimensional structure of intact roga has ever been reported. the catalytic domain of roga shows 36% identity and 52% similarity to that of anga, a functional domain with a characteristic α-helical structure. as for the three dimensional structure of sbd, it has been initially molecular modeled by structural bioinformatics methodology  <cit>  and subsequently determined by nmr spectroscopy  <cit> . interestingly, while the sbds of roga and anga share extremely low similarity in their primary structures, their secondary and tertiary structures appear to be quite similar, strongly suggesting that sbds from cbm <dig> and cbm <dig> can be grouped into a new clan with similar functional structures  <cit> . it has been clearly demonstrated that the presence of the linker region leads to much more stable conformation of the two discrete functional domains. taken together, our data provide several lines of direct evidence that the linker region of roga plays a crucial role in terms of holding structural integrity, enhancing structure stability, and facilitating functional protein expression.
