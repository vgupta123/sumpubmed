BACKGROUND
the biodiversity and specificity of animal venom compounds make them an uncommon and invaluable source from which pharmacological and therapeutic agents can be established  <cit> . in hymenoptera, the venom gland shows plasticity associated with organism life history diversification and venom compounds have evolved as important weapons used for colony or individual defense  <cit> . unlike other venoms such as from snakes, hymenopteran stings are generally not lethal causing mainly inflammatory and/or immunological reactions despite that some venoms from solitary hymenoptera have evolved to cause paralysis to permit egg laying on their arthropod hosts  <cit> . toxin peptides from social hymenoptera follow similar general features with short and linear polycationic peptides, responsible of cell lysis, hemolysis, histamine release and antimicrobial actions  <cit> . current knowledge of venom proteins and peptides involved in these processes is rather limited to stinging model species from wasps, bees, ants  <cit>  or solitary endoparasitoid wasps  <cit> . hence, little data are available from other groups especially from ants in spite of the astonishing taxonomic diversification in this insect group  <cit> . unlike stings from social bees and wasps that are solely used for defense, those from ants have additional functions as prey capture, aggregation and social communication which implies more diverse venom compounds. in addition, composition of venoms from ants varies significantly between the different ant subfamilies with probably unique venom components specific to each group which warrants their investigation  <cit> . this fact has been approved until recently by a comprehensive study of the venom gland transcriptome of the giant ant dinoponera quadriceps that revealed species-specific toxin diversification  <cit> .

in addition to biochemical investigation, ‘venomics’ involving cutting-edge transcriptomics, proteomics and high-throughput venom peptide characterization technologies are emerging projects aiming at unraveling animal venom complexity for both fundamental and practical aspects  <cit> . given that venom proteins/peptides are produced in dedicated glands, transcriptome sequencing has proven to be an effective approach to identifying the expressed toxin genes. this is of particular interest for venoms that are difficult to sample such as mandibular venoms or for animals producing limited venom amounts. the latter case applies in particular to ants, which are, due to their tiny body and venom apparatus size, difficult to screen by analytical investigation unless laborious venom sac dissection is undergone with many thousands of individuals sacrificed  <cit> .

our study species tetramorium bicarinatum  was chosen because of the diversity of its biotopes and also because this ant genus is more primitive than other highly derived genus . hence, it is considered to produce more protein venom  <cit> . in a previous study, we generated expressed sequence tags  from the venom-gland transcriptome of this species, however the study relied on sanger sequencing, generating important, but ultimately limited data  <cit> . for non-model organisms lacking defined genomes such as our studied species, de novo assembly is typically required for downstream rna-seq analyses  <cit> .

in the current study, we characterized the transcriptional expression in the venom gland cells of the ant species t. bicarinatum using next generation illumina sequencing technology. along with de novo assembly and transcriptome annotation, analysis of global patterns of gene expression and functional categorization were performed. in addition, features of some relevant putative toxin candidates are discussed.

RESULTS
illumina ngs and read assembly
the gene expression profile of tetramorium bicarinatum venom glands were deduced from mrna samples of ant whole body and venom gland tissues using the illumina sequencing approach. after the sequencing quality filtering step, a total of  <dig> , <dig> of 100-base-pair illumina reads were obtained for both samples . the de novo assemblies yielded  <dig>  contigs for the two libraries  among which  <dig>  contigs were shared by both tissues . all unassembled sequencing reads, which accounted for 25% for the ant library and 50% for the venom gland library, were excluded from our investigation. as the aim of this study was to profile venom transcriptome, we mainly focus on the  <dig>  contigs recovered from the venom gland library. the contigs recorded from the ant whole body sample were used to assess differentially expressed genes. among these detected transcripts ,  <dig>  have at least one predicted orf with  <dig> % producing significant hits in the available databases. gene ontology  functional categorization of the annotated contigs from t. bicarinatum venom glands is provided on figure  <dig>  the go analysis in relation to molecular functions revealed that the largest number of transcripts was related to protein binding, followed by catalytic activities and at a lower rate to structural protein and transporter activities . analysis of the biological processes revealed two dominant major gene categories of cellular and metabolic processes. the following categories are related to biological regulation, localization, response to stimulus, biogenesis and signaling .table  <dig>

in order to assess differentially expressed genes in the venom glands, we used the previously described deseq approach implemented in r package which allows investigation of differential expressed transcripts from high-throughput data without replicates  <cit> . regarding a likely important expression level variation between the two tested samples, the analysis failed to give workable results. this bias could be linked to the necessary pre-amplification of the venom gland sample prior to library construction compared to ant whole body sample from which extracted rna quantity was sufficient to be directly processed to cdna library construction . to bypass this bias probably originating from the amplification step, we set an arbitrary  <dig> fold expression-threshold to the  <dig>  contigs obtained from both sequenced samples. due to a lower quality of the sequencing of the read <dig>  we decided to perform our analysis using only the read <dig> for both samples. in total, we generated a list of  <dig> contigs that are  <dig> fold more expressed in the venom gland, that we called the ‘venom-gland over-expressed’ transcripts. analysis of the functional diversification among this group revealed a significant abundance  of contigs that have no hits in the databases . on the other hand, contigs that matched predicted toxins and non-toxin proteins, accounted for 11% and 3%, respectively. the remaining group of 9% consisted of uncharacterized compounds . moreover, about  <dig> contigs have significant hit with available bacterial sequences. these sequences have not been eliminated given that their low number does not affect the overall assemblage quality. the distribution of the possible bacterial community cohabiting with t. bicarinatum according to their contig number is provided in .figure  <dig>

cluster relevant to cellular functions
among the  <dig> ‘over-expressed’ transcripts, 3% clusters presented significant hits in the databases involved in various cellular functions . the most relatively high expressed transcripts of this category are those matching methyl-transferases  having transcription co-activator activities. this finding is in agreement with previous work showing that ‘gene transcription protein’ are the most abundant cellular transcripts reflecting the functional feature of the specialized tissues such as venom gland cells  <cit> . in addition, significant transcripts  matched the glucose dehydrogenase involved in carbohydrate metabolism. this enzyme, that belongs to a family of oxido-reductases, has been identified in a recent work based on genome mining and proteomic analysis and was described as a novelty in insect venoms  <cit> .

cluster related to venom toxins
venoms from social hymenoptera are important defensive weapons in which the most common components are low molecular proteins recognized as important allergens and resulting in an ige-mediated reaction  <cit> . the investigation of the reads mapping to a toxin class that accounted for 11% of the ‘over-expressed’ genes revealed a high diversification with the major part represented by hymenopteran allergens . as can be seen in figure  <dig>  venom allergens  <dig> and  <dig> have been found among the main ‘over-expressed’ transcripts in the toxin-like group . venom allergen  <dig>  described in the fire ant solenopsis invicta is closely related to vespid venom antigen  <dig> and represents the major allergen of a series of sol i peptides identified as the most frequent cause of hypersensitivity reactions following sting from this species  <cit> . amino acid sequence comparison with related sol i  <dig> allergens from our previous work shows special signature of sol i 3-like from t. bicarinatum which would be relevant in the synthesis of recombinant venom allergens for immunotherapy  <cit> . in addition to venom allergen  <dig> and  <dig>  transcripts encoding venom acid phosphatase were detected among the major expressed toxins/allergens . this enzyme has been found in relatively high levels in the honey bee and some social wasp venoms and recognized as potent releaser of histamine in human basophils  <cit> . its biological function in hymenoptera is however still unclear but appears to have evolved as a deterrent for vertebrate predators  <cit> .

members of the pilosulin-like peptides were also identified in our library. the status and features of these peptides have been discussed in our previous work where we showed that different isoforms and families of pilosulin-like sequences occur in t. bicarinatum <cit> . recently, two short peptides  from t. bicarinatum venom have been characterized by de novo sequencing using mass spectrometry and edman degradation  <cit> . the authors show that these mature peptides, identified among the most abundant in the venom of this ant species have no homolog in the public database. in our study, we have recovered these peptides and identified their cdna sequences . however, when we blast the whole peptide sequences predicted from the cdna, we found that their leader sequence and propeptide have homologies with those of pilosulin sequences . moreover, the bicarinalin has been shown to have a potent and broad antibacterial activity as much as pilosulins  <cit> . hence, it seems that the bicarinalin and peptide <dig> or the pilosulin-like forms from t. bicarinatum have the same features as some bioactive peptides in that they have a conserved secretory leader and propeptide sequence but differ greatly in their mature peptide  <cit> . this fact has been attributed to recombination as a toxin diversity-generating mechanism giving individualistic utilization of specific isoforms  <cit> .figure  <dig>

at a lower frequency, dipeptidylpeptidase iv has also been detected among the ‘over-expressed’ contig group . this enzyme is widely distributed in animal tissues and has a highly glycosylated serine protease that cleaves n-terminal dipeptides  <cit> . a role in the processing of major venom compounds is ascribed to this protein  <cit> .

in addition to the toxin found in the ‘over-expressed’ transcripts, possible toxins and related venom compounds were identified in this work among relatively less expressed transcripts . as some of these toxins/toxins-like have not been previously described from ant species and/or are potential pharmacological targets, a comparative study with families of related venom proteins has been investigated and discussed in respect to their amino-acid features.

venom allergen sol ii/ iv-like
interestingly, members of the venom allergen sol ii and the sol iv have been identified in our study. two contigs tb <dig> and tb <dig>  have shown similarities with sol ii allergen described in some fire ant species. the predicted sol ii-like amino-acid sequences are  <dig> amino-acid long for tb <dig> and  <dig> for tb <dig> with a putative predicted signal peptide cleavage site for both sequences . the tb <dig> showed a significant identity  with the queen venom protein sol g ii precursor of the species solenopsis geminata and 32% identity for the sol i ii allergen of the species s. invicta. the tb <dig> showed 23% and 26% identity with these sequences, respectively. the amino-acid alignment shows a consistent conservation of the cysteine patterns and a significant conservation of the predicted signal sequence  which suggests the presence of sol ii venom allergen in t. bicarinatum. this finding is interesting given that up to now these venom allergens have never been identified in other animal venoms and are regarded to be specific to some solenopsis species  <cit> . the main features distinguishing t. bicarinatum sol ii-like from its solenopsis sol ii counterpart are the number of cysteine residues  and the deletion of seven amino acid residues near the n-terminal and  <dig> in the c-terminal part.figure  <dig> 
amino acid sequence alignment of sol ii and sol ii- like from different ant species. the sequences of sol ii- like from t. bicarinatum tb <dig> and tb <dig> were aligned with sol i ii from solenopsis invicta  and sol g ii from solenopsis geminita . strictly conserved cysteines are indicated by black shading. cysteines that are unique to solenopsis sequences are indicated by asterisks. the predicted signal peptide cleavage site for t. bicarinatum sol ii-like is indicated by a solid green triangle.



in the same way, two transcripts of t. bicarinatum  have been found similar to the venom allergen sol iv, with consistent identity of  <dig> to 41%. the two contigs from t. bicarinatum are found more related to each other  than to sol iv from the fire ant species. given that the cysteine pattern is completely conserved along with three amino-acid motifs of more than  <dig> residues , this suggests that sol iv-like venom allergens occur in t. bicarinatum venom. as for the sol ii, sol iv is exclusively described from ants of the genus solenopsis and has never been identified in any other insect venom  <cit> .figure  <dig>

sol ii and sol iv have been described as related to each other in their amino-acid sequences but different in their expression: whereas sol ii occupy the two thirds of the protein venoms with important allergen reactivity, sol iv represent  <dig> to 9% of the protein venoms with less common patient reactivity  <cit> . in our library, the predicted sol iv-like has not been recorded among the ‘over-expressed’ transcripts, unlike venom allergens  <dig> and  <dig>  but has showed higher expression rate than sol ii-like , mirroring a possible different venom dynamic expressions across ant species. recently, a functional analysis of the sol ii from the species s. invicta emphasizes that this protein may play a role in capturing and/or transporting small hydrophobic ligands such as pheromones, odors, fatty acids, or short-living hydrophobic primers  <cit> . this is interesting in that some detected odor binding proteins in this study  and in our previous study  <cit>  might be investigated as possible venom allergens  <cit> .

t. bicarinatum pla2-like
phospholipases  are relatively common in social hymenoptera venoms occurring in different forms and are able to disrupt the phospholipid layers of several types of biological membranes responsible of many hemolytic and neurotoxic effects . in this work, five different contigs from t. bicarinatum matched with databases proteins of phospholipases a <dig>  from hymenoptera organisms but also from lizard and scorpion species . one contig  was found to be closely related  with pla <dig> previously described in the fire ant s. invicta. the remaining four contigs  showed a mean range similarities of 31% for s. invicta and 33% for apis mellifera. according to the amino-acid alignment, t. bicarinatum pla2-like sequences show a high conservation of cysteine patterns and are relatively well conserved in previously identified ca2+–binding loop region and active sites . the highly conserved active site residue his <dig> and the ca2+–binding residues gly <dig> and asp <dig>  available in group iii pla <dig> amino acid sequences  <cit>  are also well conserved in t. bicarinatum. taken together with the phylogenetic analysis , we could assume that these pla2-like from t. bicarinatum belong to the group iii family that have been identified in bee, lizard and scorpion venoms and characterized by low molecular mass  and ca2+-dependent enzyme activities  <cit> . it is worth to notice however a substitution of the highly conserved active site residue tyr <dig> with a phenylalanine in the contig tb <dig> of t. bicarinatum. as substitution in the active site and/or binding residues is critical and could result in inactive pla <dig>  <cit> , this substitution may affect the catalytic activity of this pla <dig> t. bicarinatum form. in this work, different pla2-like contigs were identified and the maximum-likelihood phylogeny tree supports the existence of different t. bicarinatum pla2-like clusters that show a closer relationship with pla <dig> from s. invicta than with the other aligned species from lizard and scorpion . the occurrence of different pla <dig> forms is in agreement with previous studies suggesting that this enzyme occurs as a series of different isoforms and/or post-translationally modified forms  <cit> .figure  <dig>

pla <dig> was previously reported in social hymenoptera as highly hemolytic. its allergenic effect however was reserved to honey bee and wasp rather than ants  <cit> . a previous study on hymenoptera venom pla <dig> activities  showed that each of the studied venom pla <dig> exhibits lineage related specific pattern and that the chemical composition of hymenopteran venoms is biologically linked to the behavior and biology of the producing organism  <cit> . indeed, a comparative study including  <dig> species from wasps and  <dig> from ants showed that phospholipase activities have generally higher levels among wasps than ants and even among ant species, differences in phospholipase concentration were also reported. while the enzyme-rich venom of the harvester ant  was reported to contain high concentrations of phospholipase a <dig>  <cit> , that from the ant myrmica ruginodis seems to lack detectable amounts of these enzyme activities  <cit> . in our study, pla2-like transcripts from t. bicarinatum venom were not detected among the ‘over-expressed’ contigs suggesting a low enzyme activity. previous study on a closer species  has shown that no activity from this enzyme was detected  <cit> , making evidence of the existence of different patterns of venom expression among and across taxa in hymenoptera even though these venoms share a degree of similarity in activity  <cit> .

t. bicarinatum pla1-like
one 1284 bp long contig  from t. bicarinatum has been identified as venom phospholipase a <dig>  and presented homologies with pla <dig> of different hymenoptera species. figure  <dig> shows the amino-acid alignment of the predicted  <dig> amino acid sequence from this contig with related vespid venom phospholipases and the sol i  <dig> from s. invicta. identity matrix shows a similarity of 31% with sol i  <dig> from s. invicta, 36% with pla <dig> from vespa crabro, 34% for vespula germanica, 34% for vespula maculifrons and 35% for vespula vulgaris. the sequence alignment shows conservation of the regions that form the enzyme active site and variation in the outer regions as described in  <cit> . the cysteine pattern displayed by t. bicarinatum represents unique features comparing to the other pla <dig> sequences. for example, the conserved cysteine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are replaced by a deletion and a serine insertion, respectively. the missing cysteine seems to occur at the position  <dig> . in addition, two tri-amino acid insertions and one tri-amino acid deletion occur at positions 58– <dig>  265– <dig> and 216– <dig>  respectively. according to the phylogeny analysis, t. bicarinatum pla1-like follows the hymenoptera phylogeny and appears to be most closely related to the fire ant phospholipase than to vespid clusters with well supported bootstrap values . this relatedness is in part due to the conserved cysteine residues between both species at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . however, the insertion of  <dig> residues near the c-terminal previously described in this fire ant was not detected for t. bicarinatum <cit> . the pla <dig> has been described in several hymenoptera venoms and it has been shown to have no sequence similarity with other known phospholipases, but has sequence similarity with mammalian lipases  <cit> . its occurrence in hymenoptera venoms was mainly associated with tissue damages and venom diffusion  <cit> .figure  <dig>

according to the differential expression analyses of transcripts abundance, it is likely that the pla1-like and pla2-like identified in t. bicarinatum venom are not among the major allergens and venom components in this ant species. however, providing ‘new’ sequence features from t. bicarinatum venom of these enzymes could be of great importance, especially to help studies aiming to build more complete microarrays of proteins for allergy diagnosis. in addition, studies of these enzymes  become useful tools for understanding ion channel structure and activity. the use of synthetic analogues from these toxins is suggested to lead to the development of new therapeutic agents and strategies for treatment of ion channel-related diseases  <cit> . besides, pla <dig> have been intensively described from snake venoms as antitumor targets  and recently it was suggested that pla <dig> from honey bee venom should be tested for the preparation of cell-based cancer vaccines  <cit> .

hyaluronidase
a 1640 bp cdna sequence  composed of  <dig> amino acid full-length orf was identified as hyaluronidase in t. bicarinatum venom. the putative amino acid sequence showed a relative high similarity to hyaluronidase sequences from other ant species  and to a. mellifera  and bombus sp. . structural features described in venom hyaluronidases  were highly conserved in t. bicarinatum, namely the four cysteine residues forming the two disulfide bridges and the active site residues . the –dfe- motif known to be extremely conserved and present in the active site of all of these molecules was also conserved  <cit>  suggesting that the contig tb <dig> from t. bicarinatum encodes hyal enzymes. hyals are in general among the more conserved hymenopteran allergens compared to other toxins such as the venom allergen  <dig> and the pla <dig>  <cit> . they were described to act as a ‘venom spreading factor’ in scorpion, snake, bee, and wasp venoms by hydrolyzing hyaluronic acid, a major component of the interstitial barrier, hence increasing the tissue permeability and easing venom component diffusion  <cit> . the expression of hyals in hymenoptera is very different depending on the organism. they were found in high level in the honey bee and some wasps but as a minor venom allergen in other organisms like the vespid yellow jacket  <cit> . in ants, enzymes with hyaluronidase activity are not described as a major component except for the harvester ant pogonomyrmex <cit> . in our study, the generated sequences matching hyals were about  <dig> times more expressed in the venom gland sequenced sample than in the ant body . given that the venom gland library was amplified prior to sequencing, only a biochemical characterization and/or a quantitative pcr should elucidate its actual expression level in t. bicarinatum.figure  <dig>

venom serine proteases
two transcripts of the contig tb <dig> of 1494 bp were identified to encode venom serine protesaes . the predicted t. bicarinatum vsps have matched with vsps from hymenoptera species, namely of the ant species camponotus floridanus with 49% identity. 41% and 40% of identity have been recorded for the bumlbee species bombus terrestris and bombus impatiens, respectively and 41% for the wasp nasonia vitripennis. consistent similarities with previously described vsp features were conserved, including the catalytic triad  , that represents the main criterion for classification of a protein as a serine protease  <cit> . serine proteases are multifunctional enzymes that play important roles in the immune response and hemostasis and are considered important allergens with significant ige binding activity  <cit> . recently, vsp from the bumblebee species bombus ignites venom was identified as a prophenoloxidase-activating factor in insects, triggering the phenoloxidase cascade and inducing thereby a lethal melanization response in target insects; whereas in mammals, it was shown to act similarly to snake vsp, which exhibits fibrinogenolytic activity  <cit> . like hyals, vsps were suggested to act as ‘spreading factor’ improving the diffusion of venom components and are likely involved in the process of their maturation or activation  <cit> .figure  <dig>

non hymenopteran toxins
the blast search against nr database of t. bicarinatum contigs tb <dig> and tb <dig> of 1303 bp and 1169 bp, respectively showed similarities with waprin-like  proteins from hymenoptera species that were submitted to genbank following whole genome sequencing or genome mining. in order to check the possible homologies with known wap from other venomous species, a blast search against an in-house toxin database  has been achieved and has revealed homologies with snake-venom wap. an average similarity of 33% with the matched snake species was recorded. domain search blast of the identified contigs against the prosite database  <cit>  revealed that the predicted sequences  contain the wap-type ‘four-disulfide core’ domain profile or whey acidic protein motif. in addition, the signature pattern of cysteine residues  in the central region found in all wap-motif proteins  <cit>  was also identified , which suggests that snake-venom wap-like are possibly expressed in t. bicarinatum venom glands. to the best of our knowledge, waps have never been reported from hymenoptera venoms. the wap family has been described from many tissue types and organisms and has been found to have many functions, including, immune-modulation, anti-protease and anti-bacterial activities  <cit> . recently, they have been described from snake venoms and from amphibian skins, each time associated with anti-microbial activities . the identification of wap from hymenoptera venom and precisely from ant venom in this study could be of great interest regarding the vast array of its biological functions and should stimulate the investigation of their activity against a panel of micro-organisms.figure  <dig>

and snake species. the waprin-like sequence from t. bicarinatum tb <dig> was aligned with waprin snake venoms of the species rhabdophis tigrinus tigrinus , thrasops jacksonii , naja nigricollis , liophis poecilogyrus  and philodryas olfersii . the conserved cysteines are shaded with black and the prolyl residue described in the wap family domain is indicated by an open red rectangle. the signature pattern of cysteine residues  in the central region found in all wap-motif proteins is indicated. the signal peptide of the predicted t. bicarinatum waprin-like tb <dig> is indicated by a solid green triangle.



in addition to waps-like discussed above, agatoxin-like sequences have also been detected in our analysis . blast search against specific toxin in-house library shows a similarity of 28% and 29% of the contigs tb <dig> and tb <dig>  respectively, to agatoxin sequence from the spider agelena orientalis , with a completely cysteine pattern conservation . the amino acid sequences deduced from both contigs have an agatoxin signature of  <dig> residues n-terminal signal peptide and  <dig> predicted mature residues. ncbi blast of these two contigs shows consistent similarities  with predicted agatoxin-like isoforms from the honey bee a. mellifera  and the bumble bee bombus impatiens . these agatoxin-like have been predicted from an automated computational analysis rather than validated from venom gland tissues. recently, based on a combined cdna cloning and shotgun deep sequencing approach, the spider u <dig> agatoxin has been recovered from the venom gland of the ant species d. quadriceps belonging to the ponerinae subfamily  <cit> . as for t. bicarinatum the agatoxin sequences are among the minor toxin-related components. this finding may be very useful especially for therapeutics based on new strategies for treatment of ion channel-related diseases. indeed, agatoxins are high specific ligands for voltage-gated ion channels and are among the potential target neurotoxins that are useful tools for studying channel structure and activity  <cit> .figure  <dig>

other toxins
other putative toxins/enzymes have been detected to be expressed by t. bicarinatum venom glands, namely secapin, venom serine carboxylesterase, venom serine carboxypeptidase, lectizyme, disintegrin and metalloproteinase-like, chymotrypsin-like inhibitors. details on their respective contigs, expression level are provided in . all these predicted toxin-like showed consistent similarities and homology with hymenopteran venom sequences mainly from ant species that have been submitted to public databases in the frame of whole genome sequencing. their description in this study strengthens their existence/expression in the venom glands.

no hits and putative ‘new’ venom toxins from t. bicarinatum
in addition to the venom peptides and proteins described above, the venom gland library contained about 40% of contigs that were not identified in the public or toxin specific databases . about 3% of these contigs with no match have been found among the arbitrary ‘overexpressed’ contigs where they form the most abundant group . that ‘no-hits’ level reflects and emphasizes the limited amount of information available for tetramorium species and more broadly from other ants in databases. definitely, this set of “no hit sequences” constitutes a potentially rich reservoir for the identification of novel toxins. in order to investigate the potential of these peptides as ‘new’ toxins, we searched for clues, such as the prediction of signal peptide and cysteine pattern. details on statistic features of the ‘no-hit’ contigs are provided in . thus, about 17% of these contigs belonging to the ‘over-expressed’ group have a predicted signal peptide and at least two cysteins. about 8% have signal sequences with no cysteine residues. as peptides from ant venom are more and more suggested to exhibit a defensive role against microbial pathogens, associated with prey introductions and/or ingestion  <cit> , special investigation of t. bicarinatum ‘no-hits’ sequences was carried out using the blast search against the antimicrobial peptide database . in addition, their signal peptide sequences were blasted against an in-house toxin-specific signal peptide database. six original toxin candidates were recorded based on their relative high expression level, presence of signal peptide and on homologies  with established antimicrobial peptides. the length of the predicted mature peptide from these sequences ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. the features of these putative novel toxins and the amino-acid alignment with their homologs from the apd are provided in . signal peptide blast result against the in-house toxin signal peptide was not significant except for the contig tb <dig> that shows supported homology  with pilosulin allergens .

the identified homologs from apd are antimicrobial peptides from the venom secretion of some scorpion and spiders species or from frog skin secretions. the major expressed contig, namely the tb <dig> matches with the charybdotoxin, an antimicrobial peptide from the yellow scorpion leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus with a sequence similarity of  <dig> % . among the  <dig> cysteine residues that are present in the t. bicarinatum peptide, two are conserved with that of the venom scorpion peptide known to target k+ channels  <cit> . the most important sequence homologies were recorded for the contig tb <dig> that matched with  <dig> % of similarity with the ponericin w <dig>  an antibacterial and insecticidal peptide from the venom of the ant pachycondyla goeldii <cit> .

given the homologies exhibited by the six t. bicarinatum predicted peptides identified in our study with antimicrobial peptides and their toxin-like features, it would be very interesting to characterize these peptides with proteomic approaches and test their antimicrobial potential against a panel of micro-organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we generated comprehensive transcriptomic data based on de novo assembly from a venom gland transcriptome of the non-model ant species t. bicarinatum . given the limited available data from venom of this zoological group, our work greatly expanded the current knowledge of these venoms. in addition, the venom protein diversity and the presence of atypical possible venom peptides recovered in this work indicate that ant venoms are a rather complex pool with currently unknown types of venom peptides that remain to be characterized and would provide a rich unexplored resource for biomedical applications. furthermore, data generated from sequencing of the whole ant body at transcription level from an ant species could be useful for entomologists.
