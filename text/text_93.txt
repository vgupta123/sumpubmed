BACKGROUND
physical interactions between proteins are essential for most, if not all, cellular processes. hence, many small-scale studies focus on finding binding partners of individual proteins, and much effort has been put into identifying protein interactions on a large scale. one of the most commonly used techniques to identify protein complex components is affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry . insight into protein complex composition obtained by ap/ms has already had a major impact on our understanding of cellular processes and signal transduction pathways  <cit> . systematic ap/ms efforts have mostly focused on single-cell systems, such as yeast, bacteria, and cultured drosophila melanogaster cells . in multicellular organisms, the composition and function of protein complexes containing a particular protein of interest may differ between cell types or tissues  <cit> . purifying a protein from whole-animal lysates will result in the identification of members of all complexes, which complicates the interpretation of the biological meaning of the identified interactors. one approach to overcome this limitation is to purify specific tissues or cell types. however, the purification of specific cell types from model organisms is challenging at the scale needed for ap/ms.

here, we present a method for the tissue-specific purification of protein complexes from the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, based on cell type-specific biotinylation. c. elegans is a widely used multicellular model organism that contains many differentiated cell types and tissues, including epithelia, neurons, and muscle. several studies have used ap/ms approaches to purify c. elegans proteins and identify interaction partners . however, tissue-specific ap/ms approaches are not widely used.

to purify proteins from specific c. elegans tissues, we adapted a system based on in vivo biotinylation of a protein of interest. in this approach, a protein of interest is tagged with the 15-amino acid avi-tag, which can be biotinylated in vivo by the bira biotin ligase from escherichia coli  <cit> . the biotinylated bait protein and any associated proteins are then purified with streptavidin-coated beads, and their identities are determined by mass spectrometry . we demonstrate the applicability of this approach by showing tissue-specific biotinylation of avi-tagged gfp, and by identifying the well-known lgl-1/par-6/pkc- <dig> complex in two epithelial tissues. we also identify a novel ubiquitous interaction between the c. elegans discs large protein dlg- <dig>  and the mitochondrial aaa-type atpase atad- <dig>  we confirm this surprising interaction by immunoprecipitation, map the atad- <dig> interaction domain by yeast two-hybrid assays, and confirm that this domain mediates the interaction in vivo. finally, we identify a candidate neuron-specific interaction between dlg- <dig> and maph- <dig> , an uncharacterized protein that shares some sequence similarity with mammalian microtubule-associated proteins map1a, map1b, and map1s. we show that maph- <dig>  is a microtubule-associated protein, and likely represents a c. elegans map <dig> family member.

RESULTS
a biotinylation-based tissue-specific protein purification approach
to purify protein from specific tissues, we express avi-tagged proteins of interest from their native regulatory sequences, while biotinylation in a specific tissue is accomplished by expressing bira from tissue-specific promoters . expression of the bait protein from its native regulatory sequences has several advantages. first, expression will closely mimic the endogenous expression pattern. second, functionality of the tagged protein can be tested by crossing the transgenic strain with a strain carrying a mutation in the corresponding gene. this simultaneously creates a strain that does not express the untagged endogenous protein. finally, only a single transgenic strain needs to be created, which can then be crossed to multiple bira driver strains to purify the protein of interest from different tissues . as a first step, we generated four distinct bira driver strains expressing c. elegans codon-optimized and myc-tagged bira ligase under the control of different promoters. two transgenic strains express bira in epithelial tissues, one expresses bira in the intestine from the elt- <dig> promoter, and one expresses bira in the seam and hyp <dig> epidermal cells from the wrt- <dig> promoter   <cit> . in addition, we generated strains expressing bira ubiquitously , and in neuronal cells . reverse transcription -pcr of transgenic animals expressing bira from the rgef- <dig> promoter showed that the bira transgene was properly transcribed and spliced .fig.  <dig> principles of the approach. a by crossing a transgenic c. elegans strain expressing the avi-tagged gene of interest  with different bira driver lines , biotinylation of the tagged protein  is accomplished in distinct tissues. b schematic drawing of the n- and c-terminal tags designed. tags contain the sequences encoding gfp , two tobacco etch virus  cleavage sites, and the avi-tag sequence



we designed n- and c-terminal tags consisting of gfp and the avi sequence, separated by two tobacco etch virus  cleavage sites, which we term the gta tag  . the presence of gfp enables the examination of the expression pattern and subcellular localization of the protein of interest, either to confirm that the tagged protein localizes as expected or to study the localization of proteins whose localization pattern has not yet been  described. tags combining gfp with affinity purification, including a similar tag incorporating the avi sequence, have been used successfully in c. elegans  <cit> . the use of tev cleavage sites is necessary to eliminate biotinylated proteins naturally present in c. elegans, which will also bind to streptavidin-coated beads. tev cleavage releases the bait protein and any associated proteins from the beads, while naturally biotinylated background proteins remain bound. gfp, tev, and avi are separated by short flexible linkers of five small amino acids, while gfp is separated from the bait protein by a longer flexible linker of  <dig> small amino acids .

to add the tags to genes encoding proteins of interest, we used fosmid recombineering, a homologous recombination-based genetic engineering technique in bacteria  <cit> . this approach enabled us to integrate the tag into large regions of genomic dna  that likely contain all the native regulatory sequences of the gene of interest, including the promoter, 3′ utr, and introns .

an overview of the entire tagging and ap/ms procedure is shown in fig.  <dig>  transgenic strains expressing gta-tagged proteins are generated by germline injection of engineered fosmids, and the transgenic array is integrated into the genome by gamma irradiation. transgenic strains expressing the gta-tagged bait protein are then crossed to bira-expressing strains. whenever possible, transgenic strains are also crossed to strains carrying a mutation in the endogenous protein of interest. this allows testing to determine if the tagged protein is fully functional and eliminates the presence of wild-type untagged protein, which would otherwise reduce the fraction of complexes incorporating a tagged protein. the strains are grown at a large scale in liquid culture before harvesting, lysis, and purification of biotinylated proteins with streptavidin-coated beads. the bait protein and any bound proteins are then cleaved off the beads using tev protease, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry  to determine their identities.fig.  <dig> schematic of the workflow. a the gta tag is added to a gene of interest using recombineering. b transgenic c. elegans strains expressing the gta-tagged protein are generated by injection followed by gamma irradiation-mediated integration of the extrachromosomal array. c transgenic strains are crossed with strains expressing bira from a tissue-specific promoter, and with a genetic null mutant if appropriate. d the transgenic strains are grown in triplicate in liquid culture. e affinity purification is performed on whole-animal lysates. the bait protein with any interacting proteins is subsequently cleaved off the beads by tobacco etch virus  protease. f the samples are analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry  to identify the proteins they contain



in vivo biotinylation and purification are highly tissue-specific
tissue-specific expression of bira should result in purification of the bait protein specifically from that tissue. however, at least two potential problems might give rise to biotinylation – and thus purification – of proteins from unintended tissues. first, if the expression of bira is not tightly limited to the tissue of interest, bira might be expressed at low levels in other tissues. however, many promoters with well-documented and highly tissue-specific expression patterns have been identified in c. elegans. second, bira might biotinylate avi-tagged proteins after the lysis procedure, when proteins from the entire animal are mixed together. the risk of this is low, as bira activity requires the presence of bivalent ions, which are chelated by the edta in the lysis buffer  <cit> . nevertheless, we first wished to demonstrate the specificity of biotinylation and purification from a specific tissue.

to test the tissue specificity of our approach, we generated transgenic c. elegans strains expressing cytoplasmic avi-tagged gfp from the intestinal elt- <dig> promoter and the seam and hyp <dig> epidermal wrt- <dig> promoter. both gta strains showed expression of cytoplasmic gfp in the expected cells . we crossed each gta strain with both epithelial bira driver strains. of the four resulting strains, two expressed the biotin ligase and gta in the same tissue , while the other two expressed bira and gta in two different tissues. animals of all four strains were lysed, biotinylated proteins were purified using streptavidin-coated beads, and the presence of gfp was examined by western blot with an antibody directed against gfp. all samples showed the expected purification pattern: when bira and gta were present in the same tissue, gta was purified by the streptavidin beads; when bira and gta were expressed in separate tissues, no gta was purified . thus, in vivo biotinylation and protein purification are highly tissue specific.fig.  <dig> in vivo biotinylation is highly tissue-specific. a expression of gfp::tev::avi from the intestinal elt- <dig> promoter. b expression of gfp::tev::avi from the seam and hyp <dig> epidermal cell-specific wrt- <dig> promoter. in a and b, the tissue and approximate region imaged are indicated in the cartoon worm. c western blot detection of gfp::tev::avi purified with streptavidin beads from lysates obtained from animals expressing gfp::tev::avi and bira in the same tissue  or in different tissues . scale bars are 10 μm



gta-tagged bait proteins are functional and recapitulate known localization patterns
to test the tissue-specific purification approach, we tagged five polarity regulators that show distinct subcellular localization patterns with the gta tag: the apical protein par- <dig>  the junctional protein dlg- <dig>  the basolateral proteins let- <dig> and lgl- <dig>  and the cortical protein cdc- <dig>  these five proteins all contain multiple protein–protein interaction domains and for some of these proteins, interacting partners have already been identified in c. elegans or other systems. for example, dlg- <dig> interacts with the c. elegans-specific protein ajm- <dig>  whereas par- <dig> and lgl- <dig> can both form a complex with pkc- <dig> and par- <dig>  and cdc- <dig> binds to par- <dig> . for par- <dig>  dlg- <dig>  let- <dig>  and lgl- <dig>  we added the gta tag to the c-terminus, as c-terminal tags are more often compatible with protein function than n-terminal tags  <cit> . for cdc- <dig>  we used the n-terminal tag, as it has already been shown that c. elegans gfp::cdc- <dig> is able to localize to the cortex, similar to wild-type cdc- <dig>  <cit> . for all five genes, we successfully generated integrated transgenic strains using the procedure outlined in fig.  <dig>  we examined the expression pattern of the tagged bait proteins in the intestine and seam cells and found that all proteins localized to the expected subcellular domains . in both tissues we observed junctional localization of dlg-1::gta, basolateral localization of let-413::gta and lgl-1::gta, and cortical localization of gta::cdc- <dig>  par-3::gta was visible at the apical surface of the seam cells. unexpectedly, no tagged par- <dig> was detected in the intestinal epithelium. in addition to the epithelial localization, we also observed expression of dlg-1::gta in ventral cord neurons , which is consistent with the expression in neurons of the human homolog dlg <dig>   <cit> .fig.  <dig> spinning disc confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images of subcellular localization patterns of gta-tagged bait proteins. a schematic representation of the areas imaged. b localization in intestinal cells. c localization in seam cells. in both tissues, cdc- <dig> localizes to cortex, dlg- <dig> localizes to cell junctions, and let- <dig> and lgl- <dig> localize to basolateral cortex. par- <dig> localizes apically in seam cells, while no par- <dig> expression was detected in intestine. d expression of dlg-1::gta in ventral cord neurons . scale bars are 10 μm



we crossed the dlg- <dig>  lgl- <dig>  and let- <dig> gta-tagged transgenic strains with strains carrying a mutant allele of the corresponding endogenous gene. cdc- <dig> and par- <dig> null alleles are early embryonic lethal  <cit> . transgenes are usually silenced in the germline and are therefore unlikely to rescue these phenotypes. consequently, we did not use mutant backgrounds for these two bait proteins.

the dlg-1::gta transgenic strain was crossed with a strain carrying the dlg- <dig> deletion allele, which causes embryonic arrest at the 2-fold stage. homozygous dlg- <dig> mutants carrying the dlg-1::gta transgene were fully viable, demonstrating that the dlg-1::gta protein is functional. loss of lgl- <dig> does not affect cell polarity or viability, preventing a complementation test of the functionality of the lgl-1::gta transgene  <cit> . nevertheless, we crossed our lgl-1::gta transgenic strain with the lgl- <dig> deletion allele to prevent incorporation of untagged lgl- <dig> protein into complexes. for let- <dig>  no molecular null allele is available, and the let-413::gta transgenic strain was crossed with a strain carrying the let- <dig> missense mutation, which causes lethality during elongation of the developing embryo  <cit> . while expression of let-413::gta restored embryonic viability, this strain still grew slowly. let- <dig> purifications where therefore performed in a let- <dig> wild-type background.

in summary, the five tagged proteins localize to the appropriate subcellular domains, and the two transgenes that we could test in complementation assays rescue the lethality caused by the corresponding mutant alleles. thus, the experimental design appears well suited for the tagging of proteins of interest, without interfering with their function.

large-scale culturing and purification of protein complexes
each of the five transgenic strains were crossed with the prps-27::bira , pelt-2::bira , and pwrt-2::bira  bira driver strains. because of the observed neuronal localization of dlg- <dig>  the dlg-1::gta strain was also crossed with the pan-neuronal prgef-1::bira transgenic strain . as described above, the dlg-1::gta and lgl-1::gta transgenic strains also carried a putative null mutation in the corresponding endogenous gene. as a negative control to identify common contaminant proteins or proteins that bind to the gta tag, we generated a transgenic strain expressing cytoplasmic gfp::tev::avi from the ubiquitous rps- <dig> promoter, which was crossed with each of the four bira driver strains. in total  <dig> transgenic strains were generated for affinity purification: strains expressing one of the five tagged bait proteins or the gfp::tev::avi control construct, combined with bira expression from one of three different promoters, and in addition, two strains expressing dlg-1::gta or gfp::tev::avi transgenes combined with bira expression under the control of the neuronal rgef- <dig> promoter.table  <dig> lines generated for purification

each of the  <dig> strains was grown in large-scale liquid culture, starting from semi-synchronized l <dig> cultures generated by starvation on plates. after growth in liquid culture, animals were harvested when most larvae were at the third or fourth larval stage. all strains were grown and analyzed in triplicate to enhance the possibility of separating bona fide protein–protein interactions from nonspecific interactions. all of the harvested cultures were lysed by sonication, and biotinylated proteins were purified using streptavidin-coated beads. next, bait proteins and binding partners were released from the streptavidin beads through tev protease cleavage.

to examine the specificity of the biotinylation by bira, and the efficiency of the purification and subsequent release by tev cleavage, we analyzed expression and purification of dlg-1::gta . western blot analysis of biotinylated proteins in whole lysates showed a band of the correct molecular weight in samples expressing dlg-1::gta and ubiquitous bira, which was absent from the wild-type n <dig> control . no additional biotinylated bands were detected upon expression of bira, indicating that bira specifically biotinylates the avi-tag. analysis of beads and eluate after purification with streptavidin beads and tev cleavage showed that dlg-1::gfp was released from the beads, while endogenously biotinylated proteins remained bound . we also analyzed the biotinylation efficiency and recovery by tev cleavage of gta::cdc- <dig>  we purified gta::cdc- <dig> from a strain expressing bira in the seam and hyp <dig> epidermal cells using gfp-trap beads as well as streptavidin beads . the equal levels of recovery  indicate efficient biotinylation of gta::cdc- <dig>  analysis of beads and eluate after tev cleavage of gta::cdc- <dig> purified with streptavidin beads indicate efficient tev cleavage. however, approximately half of the cdc- <dig> remained bound to the beads, despite having been cleaved by tev . thus, the overall efficiency of recovery can vary between bait proteins.fig.  <dig> in vivo biotinylation of gta-tagged protein and removal of endogenously biotinylated proteins by tobacco etch virus  cleavage. a western blot detection of biotinylated proteins in lysed wild-type n <dig> animals  and lysed animals expressing gta-tagged dlg- <dig> and ubiquitously expressed bira . an additional band of the correct estimated molecular weight for dlg-1::gta is detected upon expression of bira . b western blot analysis of eluate and beads after purification and release of bound bait protein by tev cleavage. both blots contain the same samples. the background of naturally biotinylated proteins remains bound to the streptavidin beads and is visible on the α-biotin western blot in the beads remainder, while tagged dlg- <dig> is cleaved off and visible on the α-gfp western blot in the eluate. no dlg- <dig> protein is purified in samples from animals not expressing bira. c

tissue-specific protein purification recovers known lgl- <dig> interactors
we next analyzed the samples by high-resolution ms. each sample was run on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  gel for a length of ~1 cm, followed by in-gel digestion with trypsin and liquid chromatography  ms/ms analysis. raw data are available via proteomexchange with identifier pxd <dig>  to distinguish genuine interacting proteins from nonspecific binding proteins, we analyzed the data using the saint tool, which was developed to assign confidence scores to protein–protein interactions identified in ap/ms experiments  <cit> . based on label-free quantification data, and taking into account the number of replicates in which a protein is observed, as well as negative control data, saint assigns a probability score to each bait–prey pair identified  <cit> . scores range from  <dig> to  <dig>  and interactions scoring > <dig>  can be considered to represent high confidence interactions  <cit> . we analyzed our samples using saint express embedded within the crapome online interface  <cit> . spectral counts for the triplicate experiments and negative control samples were uploaded and processed using the default settings. the four tissues analyzed  were processed separately. the results are presented in additional file 4: table s <dig> and additional file 5: table s <dig> 

the bait proteins lgl- <dig>  cdc- <dig>  dlg- <dig>  and let- <dig> were each themselves identified with high confidence: saint probability scores were ≥ <dig>  in all tissues examined, with the exception of let- <dig> in the intestine . bait protein par- <dig> was only identified in the ubiquitous sample, with a saint score of  <dig> . because par-3::gta was readily detected by microscopy, the protein is likely not efficiently recovered in our purification procedure. par- <dig> samples were therefore excluded from further analysis. the remaining four baits together identified  <dig> high confidence interactions, which were identified in at least one tissue with a saint score > <dig> . however,  <dig> of these were ribosomal proteins or proteins associated with ribosome biogenesis, and most of these were identified with multiple bait proteins . disregarding interactions with these ribosome-associated proteins, we identified  <dig> interactions with dlg- <dig>  two interactions with let- <dig>  and three interactions with lgl- <dig> . no interactions with a saint score > <dig>  were identified with cdc- <dig>  however, in an independent experiment, cdc- <dig> co-purified with the rhogdi rhi- <dig>  a known interactor of cdc- <dig>  <cit>  , which indicates that adjusting purification conditions may yield additional interacting proteins.table  <dig> candidate interactors identified

shown are putative interactors identified with a saint confidence score > <dig>  in at least one of the four tissues examined. ribosomal proteins are not shown. an expanded copy of this table including spectra counts is shown in additional file 5: table s2



the proteins that co-purified with let- <dig> appear unlikely to be specifically involved in cell polarity: b <dig>  is a homolog of β-ketothiolase, and qars- <dig> is a glutaminyl trna synthetase. in contrast, lgl- <dig> co-purified with par- <dig> and pkc- <dig>  c. elegans lgl- <dig> was previously found to be associated with par- <dig> and pkc- <dig> in embryos  <cit> , and drosophila and mammalian lgl form a complex with par- <dig> and apkc  <cit> . in our experiments, par- <dig> and pkc- <dig> both co-purified with lgl- <dig> biotinylated specifically in the intestine or seam and hyp <dig> epidermal cells, as well as with ubiquitously biotinylated lgl- <dig>  these results demonstrate that our biotinylation-based approach is able to identify biologically relevant interactions from specific tissues with high confidence.

identification of a novel interaction between dlg- <dig> and the aaa atpase-family protein atad-3
to validate the ability of our approach to identify novel interactors, we focused on the candidate dlg- <dig> interaction partner atad- <dig>  which was identified with high confidence using ubiquitously biotinylated dlg-1::gta, as well as with lower confidence using bira expressed in epidermal cells, intestine, and neurons . moreover, atad- <dig> was not identified with any confidence with the other bait proteins . atad- <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved aaa-family atpase that is essential for mitochondrial activity and development of c. elegans  <cit> . we verified the ubiquitous nature of the dlg-1/atad- <dig> interaction by immunoprecipitating atad- <dig> and dlg- <dig> from embryonic lysates using specific antibodies. purification of atad- <dig> revealed co-immunoprecipitation of dlg- <dig> at a level that was comparable to that observed after dlg- <dig> immunoprecipitation . this suggests that a major fraction of dlg- <dig> interacts with atad- <dig> in the embryo. conversely, purification of dlg- <dig> resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of only a small amount of atad- <dig> . purification of atad- <dig> or dlg- <dig> from lysates of embryos treated with rnai directed against dlg- <dig> or atad- <dig> failed to co-immunoprecipitate substantial amounts of dlg- <dig> or atad- <dig>  thus, the co-immunoprecipitation of dlg- <dig> is dependent on the presence of atad- <dig>  and vice versa. together, these data indicate that dlg- <dig> specifically interacts with atad- <dig> fig.  <dig> confirmation of the dlg-1/atad- <dig> interaction and mapping of the interaction domain. a western blots showing co-immunoprecipitation  of dgl- <dig> and atad- <dig>  to demonstrate specificity of the detection, samples were treated with control rnai  or rnai against dlg- <dig> or atad- <dig>  left panels: input lysates before ip. middle panels: dlg- <dig> ip. right panels: atad- <dig> ip. b atad- <dig> interacts with dlg- <dig> in yeast two-hybrid experiments. this interaction depends on the c-terminal etav motif of atad- <dig> and the second pdz domain of dlg- <dig>  note that atad- <dig> fragments lacking this c-terminal etav motif fail to interact with dlg- <dig> pdz domains. a fragment containing pdz 1– <dig> domains from drosophila bazooka was used as a negative control. n.d. not determined. c ip/western blotting experiment shows that, in vivo, the dlg-1/atad- <dig> interaction requires the c-terminal etav motif of atad- <dig>  lanes on the left show input signals of dlg- <dig> and atad- <dig>  the lanes on the right show ips in corresponding lysates. d progeny produced by n <dig> animals, or animals expressing full-length atad- <dig>  and atad- <dig> lacking the c-terminal four amino acids  at 15 °c and 25 °c. total: average total progeny produced. emb: average number of embryonic lethal progeny produced. bars represent average values, and error bars the standard deviation. n = 4



dlg- <dig> contains three pdz domains, which are known to function as protein interaction modules. yeast two-hybrid experiments with fragments of dlg- <dig> revealed that atad- <dig> binds to the second pdz domain of dlg- <dig> . pdz domains frequently bind to short c-terminal motifs in interacting proteins, and the final four amino acids of atad- <dig>  match a predicted pdz domain-binding-specificity class  <cit> . indeed, removal of the etav sequence rendered atad- <dig> incapable of binding to dlg- <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system . this indicates that atad- <dig> binds with its c-terminal etav motif to the second pdz domain of dlg- <dig>  to investigate whether the etav motif is necessary in vivo to mediate the interaction of atad- <dig> with dlg- <dig>  we generated strains expressing full-length atad- <dig> , or atad- <dig> lacking the c-terminal four amino acids . we inserted single-copy transgenes in chromosome iv by mossci  <cit> , and crossed these animals with the atad- <dig> strain to obtain animals expressing only the transgene. both strains express atad- <dig> at levels comparable to wild type . co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that atadfl interacts with dlg- <dig> in embryos . in contrast, truncation of the c-terminal etav motif of atad- <dig> completely prevented the dlg- <dig> interaction in vivo . these data strongly support the presence of a direct physical interaction between atad- <dig> and dlg- <dig>  mediated by the second pdz domain of dlg- <dig> and the c-terminal etav motif of atad- <dig> 

both the atad-3fl and the atadΔetav strains are viable. however, atadΔetav animals displayed a dramatically reduced fertility compared to wild type, as well as an increase in embryonic lethality . this phenotype was exacerbated at 25 °c compared to 15 °c. these findings indicate that the interaction between atad- <dig> and dlg- <dig> is physiologically relevant.

identification of a c. elegans map1-family member as a candidate neuron-specific dlg- <dig> interacting protein
four of the dlg- <dig> interactors co-purified exclusively with dlg-1::gta biotinylated in neurons, and may therefore represent proteins that function with dlg- <dig> specifically in this tissue. blast searches with one of these proteins, f32a <dig> , identified the map <dig> family of microtubule-associated proteins  as the closest homologs of f32a <dig> . mammalian genomes generally encode three map <dig> proteins: map1a, map1b, and the shorter family member map1s. in drosophila, a single homolog termed futsch has been described, which shares homology with mammalian map1a and map1b in the n- and c-terminal regions  <cit> . interestingly, map1a localizes to postsynaptic densities, and interacts with the dlg- <dig> homologs dlg <dig> , dlg <dig> , and dlg <dig>   <cit> . to date, no c. elegans map1-family proteins have been described. we hypothesized that f32a <dig>  represents a c. elegans map1-family member, and examined this protein in more detail.

map1a, map1b, and futsch are large proteins  with no predicted folded domains and extensive predicted unstructured regions. all three proteins are proteolytically cleaved into a heavy chain and a 26–30 kda light chain derived from the c-terminus  <cit> . c. elegans f32a <dig>  is smaller , but also contains a large predicted unstructured region. analogous to futsch, the similarity of f32a <dig>  with the mammalian map <dig> proteins was largely limited to the n- and c-terminus . phylogenetic analysis indicated that f32a <dig>  is equally related to map1a, map1b, and map1s . the c. elegans genome encodes two other proteins that are highly similar to f32a <dig> , termed f25d <dig>  and c36a <dig> . the high degree of similarity between these proteins  indicates that they are paralogs, and in the eggnog  <dig>  database of orthologous groups all three proteins are placed in the same orthologous group as mammalian map1a, map1b, and map1s  <cit> . based on phylogeny and the results presented below, we name these proteins maph- <dig> , maph- <dig> , and maph- <dig> , for “microtubule-associated protein  <dig> homolog  <dig> ”fig.  <dig> maph- <dig>  is a microtubule-associated protein related to mammalian map <dig> proteins. a sequence similarity between maph- <dig>  and human map1a, and between maph- <dig>  and drosophila futsch. for each protein the predicted disordered region is indicated in green. protein sizes are to scale. for map1a and futsch, a red line indicates the proteolytic cleavage site that is used to generate a light chain . a dotted red line indicates the homologous position in maph- <dig> . sequence similarity is indicated for three regions: two conserved n- and c-terminal regions  and the intervening less conserved region. amino acid coordinates for these regions are: map-1 n-terminal region 274– <dig>  map- <dig> c-terminal region 2847– <dig>  maph- <dig>  n-terminal region 1– <dig>  maph- <dig>  c-terminal region 742– <dig>  futsch n-terminal region 291– <dig>  and futsch c-terminal region 5082– <dig>  b phylogenetic tree of map1-related proteins. color coding indicates groups containing human map1a , map1b , and map1s . c western blots showing co-immunoprecipitation of dgl-1::gta and gfp::maph- <dig> . input lysates  show expression of dlg-1::gta , gfp::maph- <dig> , and the empty gta tag . maph- <dig>  co-purifies with dlg-1::gta  but not with the gta tag alone . strains used are n <dig> , box <dig> , box <dig> , box <dig> . d expression of gfp::maph- <dig> from an endogenously tagged gfp::maph- <dig>  locus. nerve ring, pharynx, seam cells, and hypodermis panels were taken from the same l <dig> stage animal. body wall muscle and vulva panels are ventral views from a second animal. arrowheads indicate the nerve ring an two seam cells. cartoons are schematic representations of the areas imaged. e expression of an n-terminal gfp::maph- <dig>  fusion in 6-day-old primary rat hippocampal neuron cultures. cells were co-stained for map <dig>  which localizes to microtubules in dendrites, and for α-tubulin. the right panel is a merge with map <dig> in cyan, maph- <dig>  in green, and microtubules in magenta. the arrowhead indicates the axon. f expression of a c-terminal dlg-1::mcherry fusion in 24-day-old primary hippocampal neuron cultures. all scale bars are 10 μm



to examine the expression pattern and subcellular localization of maph- <dig> , and to validate the interaction with dlg- <dig>  we used crispr/cas9-based genome editing to engineer a gfp-tagged maph- <dig> locus . by western blot, gfp::maph- <dig>  has an apparent molecular weight of ~60 kda, much lower than the predicted 119 kda molecular weight of an unprocessed gfp::maph- <dig>  fusion . this indicates that, like the mammalian map <dig> proteins, maph- <dig>  is proteolytically cleaved. to confirm the co-affinity purification of maph- <dig>  with dlg- <dig>  we crossed the gfp::maph- <dig>  strain with a strain expressing dlg-1::gta from its own promoter and bira from the neuronal rgef- <dig> promoter. as a control, we crossed the gfp::maph- <dig>  strain with a strain ubiquitously expressing cytoplasmic gfp::tev::avi, and expressing bira in neurons. we purified dlg-1::gta using streptavidin-coated beads, and tested for co-purification of maph- <dig>  by western blotting using an antibody detecting gfp. we observed co-purification of maph- <dig>  with dlg-1::gta, but not with the gfp::tev::avi control . this confirms the identification of maph- <dig>  in neuronal dlg- <dig> purifications by ms.

we observed broad expression of gfp::maph- <dig>  in multiple somatic postembryonic tissues. this included neurons, but also body wall muscle cells, the vulva, vulval muscle cells, the hypodermis, seam cells, and intestinal cells . the fact that we did not identify maph- <dig>  in dlg- <dig> purifications from seam or intestinal cells implies that this interaction is either occurring only in neurons, or stabilized in neurons by a neuron-specific protein.

the subcellular localization pattern of gfp::maph- <dig>  closely resembled that of previously described non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in uterine muscle cells  <cit> , circumferential microtubule arrays in the hypodermis  <cit> , and body wall muscle cells  <cit>  . furthermore, live imaging revealed a highly dynamic behavior of the observed arrays, including shrinkage events . we measured the shrinkage rate of several arrays in the hypodermis and body wall muscle cells, and obtained an average rate of  <dig>  μm/s and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/s respectively . these rates are consistent with the previously observed shrinkage rate of  <dig>  μm/s for non-centrosomal microtubule bundles in differentiated uterine muscle cells  <cit> . finally, we examined the dynamics of gfp::maph- <dig>  using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching . gfp::maph- <dig>  showed a half-time of recovery of 6 s, which is similar to the rapid dynamics observed for the microtubule-binding domain of ensconsin   <cit> . all of these observations are consistent with maph- <dig>  acting as a microtubule-binding protein. nevertheless, in body wall muscle cells and the hypodermids, tubulin and actin can form bundles that are similar in appearance. given that mammalian map <dig> proteins can associate with actin  <cit> , we cannot exclude that maph- <dig>  also localizes to actin structures.

to further confirm the localization of maph- <dig>  to microtubules, particularly in neurons, we expressed a translational gfp::maph- <dig>  fusion protein in cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons, in which microtubules are easily visualized. co-staining with an antibody directed against α-tubulin showed clear co-localization of maph- <dig>  with microtubules in the neuronal cell body, axon, and dendrites . we also expressed a dlg-1:: mcherry fusion protein in cultured hippocampal neurons, and observed localization to synaptic structures in dendrites . we conclude that, like mammalian map1a, maph- <dig>  is a microtubule-associated protein, and a candidate neuron-specific interaction partner of dlg- <dig>  in contrast to map1a, however, maph- <dig>  is broadly, if not ubiquitously, expressed.

discussion
here, we describe an in vivo biotinylation-based ap/ms approach to purify protein complexes from specific tissues in c. elegans. proteins of interest were expressed with a gta tag under the control of their normal regulatory sequences, and biotinylation in a single tissue was accomplished by expressing bira from a tissue-specific promoter. expression of gfp::tev::avi and bira in two different tissues confirmed that biotinylation and purification are indeed tissue-specific. the ability of our approach to identify bona fide protein interactions from specific tissues was demonstrated by the identification of the known lgl- <dig> interaction partners par- <dig> and pkc- <dig> from two distinct epithelial tissues. we also detected a prominent interaction between the junctional scaffold protein dlg- <dig> and the mitochondrial aaa atpase atad- <dig>  we confirmed this interaction through affinity purification, identified the interacting motif by yeast two-hybrid assays, and demonstrate the requirement for this motif for the atad-3/dlg- <dig> interaction in vivo. finally, through neuron-specific purification of dlg- <dig> we identified maph- <dig>  as an interactor of dlg- <dig>  and demonstrate that this protein represents a c. elegans member of the map <dig> family of maps.

as is generally the case with interaction detection assays, not all known interactions were recovered. in some cases, this may have been due to the stringency of the saint threshold of  <dig> , as potentially relevant interactions were observed below this threshold. for example, ajm- <dig> is a known interaction partner of dlg- <dig>  <cit> , and co-purified with dlg- <dig> from neurons with a saint score of  <dig> . similarly, in mdck cells, scribble has been reported to associate with lgl <dig>  <cit> , and in our experiments lgl- <dig> co-purified with let- <dig> from intestine with a saint score of  <dig> . neither ajm- <dig> nor lgl- <dig> co-purified with other baits, which indicates that these may represent valid and specific interactions. we also observed that not all bait proteins were recovered at equal levels, which may contribute to the lack of recovery of some known interaction partners. a number of different reasons may cause inefficient bait protein recovery. for example, some proteins may be present at low levels, or may not be effectively released in soluble form into the supernatant by the lysis procedure. it is also possible that some proteins are biotinylated less efficiently in vivo, or that the efficiency of tev cleavage varies. in part, such issues may be overcome by optimization of lysis and purification conditions for specific bait proteins.

an affinity purification tag incorporating gfp and avi has been used previously in c. elegans to purify a protein complex  <cit> . however, tissue specificity of the biotinylation and purification procedure had not been demonstrated, and no tissue-specific protein interactions had been identified to date. two other proteomics approaches using bira-mediated in vivo biotinylation have also been described in c. elegans. one study used in vivo biotinylation of the histone h <dig>  protein for the purification of chromatin and epigenetic profiling  <cit> . another study used biotinylation of the nuclear pore complex component npp- <dig> to purify nuclei from specific tissues  <cit> . thus, in vivo biotinylation is proving to be a versatile method for tissue-specific proteomics approaches in c. elegans.

the gta tag includes gfp to visualize the subcellular localization of tagged proteins. the expression patterns of the gta-tagged proteins we observed largely confirmed known localizations, though we failed to observe intestinal localization of par-3::gta. possibly, the regulatory sequences of par- <dig> extend beyond the region included in the fosmid, or the par- <dig> splice variants we tagged are not expressed in the intestine. two alternative start sites have already been documented to affect the expression pattern of par- <dig>  and it is conceivable that different 3′-ends can also affect par- <dig> expression  <cit> . in addition to previously described localization patterns, we observed expression of dlg-1::gta in ventral cord neurons. although the localization did not clearly resemble a synaptic pattern, this observation is consistent with the identification of mammalian dlg- <dig> homologs as postsynaptic density  proteins.

we identified a novel interaction between the junctional scaffold protein dlg- <dig> and the evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial aaa atpase atad- <dig>  atad- <dig> and its homologs in other species  have been described as mitochondrial proteins with roles in tumor progression . inactivation of atad- <dig> by rnai causes defects in the development and functioning of mitochondria, and results in embryonic lethality and early larval arrest  <cit> . immunopurification followed by western blotting indicated that a substantial fraction of dlg- <dig> associates with atad- <dig>  while only a small sub-fraction of atad- <dig> is in complex with dlg- <dig>  atad- <dig> contains a putative transmembrane domain and has been reported to be inserted into the inner membrane of mitochondria, with its c-terminus located in the matrix and the n-terminus facing the cytosol  <cit> . given the specific binding of dlg- <dig> to the c-terminal end of atad- <dig>  the dlg-1/atad- <dig> interaction should either occur in the matrix of mitochondria, or involve a subpopulation of atad- <dig> that is not present in the mitochondria. results from several studies support that mammalian atad3a does not reside exclusively in mitochondria  <cit> . in fact, a substantial number of mitochondrial proteins are dually localized  <cit> . in particular, proteins that have a less well-defined mitochondrial targeting sequence are more likely to be found at multiple subcellular locations. atad- <dig> has no recognizable mitochondrial targeting sequence and has been found in the plasma-membrane in certain cancer cells  <cit> , and in the endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria-associated membrane  fraction  <cit> . these findings indicate the possibility for interactions with atad- <dig> outside of mitochondria. our finding that expression of atad-3fl rescues the atad- <dig> mutation to a greater extent than expression of atadΔetav suggests that the dlg-1/atad- <dig> interaction plays an important role in c. elegans development. in epithelial cells, dlg- <dig> localizes to cell junctions  <cit> , a location that has not been observed for atad- <dig>  although the exact contribution of the interaction with atad- <dig> to dlg- <dig> remains to be discovered, it is possible that this interaction is of importance before the formation of cell junctions, or affects a non-junctional pool of dlg- <dig> 

maps control the organization, stability, and function of the microtubule cytoskeleton  <cit> . the mammalian map <dig> family of maps contains three family members: map1a, map1b, and the smaller map1s  <cit> . in drosophila, a single map <dig> protein, termed futsch, has been identified  <cit> . map1a, map1b, and drosophila futsch are predominantly expressed in neurons, and have been shown to play a role in several aspects of neuronal development and functioning  <cit> . map-1a is found in psds, where it interacts with the mammalian dlg <dig> , dlg <dig> , and dlg <dig>   <cit> . to date, no c. elegans map <dig> proteins had been described, and no clear orthologs are present in the genome. purification of c. elegans dlg- <dig> from neurons resulted in the identification of f32a <dig>  as a candidate interaction partner. based on sequence similarity to mammalian map <dig> proteins, we postulate that f32a <dig>  is a c. elegans map <dig> protein, which we named maph- <dig>  for “microtubule-associated protein  <dig> homolog  <dig> ” maph- <dig>  did not co-purify with dlg- <dig> biotinylated in the intestine or epidermal cells, nor with ubiquitously biotinylated dlg- <dig>  despite expression of maph- <dig>  in many non-neuronal tissues, including seam and intestine. despite the high saint score with which maph- <dig>  was identified in neuron-specific dlg- <dig> purifications, the actual number of peptides identified was low. this may reflect that only a minor fraction of dlg- <dig> and maph- <dig>  associate in neurons, or that a neuron-specific protein stabilizes the dlg-1/maph- <dig>  interaction, which would illustrate the value of using a tissue-specific approach. however, further study will be needed to confirm a biological role of this interaction in neurons in vivo.

the localization of maph- <dig>  to dynamic arrays resembling previously published microtubule arrays, the shrinkage parameters of these arrays, and the co-localization with microtubules in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons all support a function for maph- <dig>  as a map. the c. elegans genome encodes two other proteins that are highly similar to f32a <dig> , termed f25d <dig> , and c36a <dig> , which we termed maph- <dig>  and maph- <dig> . we did not identify maph- <dig>  in any of our purifications, but maph- <dig>  also interacted with dlg- <dig> specifically in neurons, though at a much lower confidence level .

map1a binds to the guanylate kinase  domain of dlg <dig> through a short peptide motif  <cit> , which does not appear to be conserved in the c. elegans maph- <dig> proteins. however, mutational analysis of the gk binding motif showed that it is highly permissive of changes, and gk binding sites do not appear to be well conserved across different proteins  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the mammalian consensus sequence has diverged from the maph- <dig>  binding site for dlg- <dig>  mammalian map1a and map1b, as well as futsch, are proteolytically cleaved into heavy and light chains  <cit> . residues surrounding the cleavage site are poorly conserved between map1a/b and futsch, and we could not identify a candidate cleavage site in maph- <dig>  by sequence analysis. thus, it remains to be determined if the c. elegans maph- <dig> proteins are proteolytically cleaved. in mammals, map1a and map1b heavy and light chains assemble into a trimeric complex together with the separately encoded map <dig> light chain  <dig>   <cit> . the c. elegans protein lgg- <dig>  which plays an important role in the generation of autolysosomes, is highly similar to lc <dig>  <cit> , consistent with conservation of the mechanism of map <dig> functioning in c. elegans. however, a role for lgg- <dig> in neuronal function or microtubule regulation has not been examined.

CONCLUSIONS
the approach we presented here should be widely applicable for the identification of protein complexes for many proteins, provided that the bait protein is soluble after lysis and can be tagged at either the n-terminus or c-terminus without interfering with the function of the protein. in addition, our approach can be used to identify tissue-specific protein modifications of the bait protein, such as phosphorylations, and to reveal differences in protein complex composition over time by using synchronized cultures. here, we used fosmid-based recombineering to generate the transgenic strains. with the development of crispr/cas9-based genome engineering, it has become possible to endogenously tag any c. elegans gene of interest  <cit> . thus, genes can now be endogenously tagged with the gta tag, which eliminates the need for crosses with a null mutant background, and should result in even more reliable expression patterns.
