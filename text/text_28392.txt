BACKGROUND
most membrane proteins are not abundantly expressed in their native tissues making it hard to recover enough material for functional and structural studies. in addition several isoforms with similar biochemical properties are often co-expressed which further complicates the purification process. hence, efficient heterologous systems for overexpression are important for biochemical characterisation of membrane proteins, which is also reflected by the increase in membrane protein structures derived from heterologously expressed material over the last decade  <cit> . escherichia coli is still the most common host for membrane protein overexpression but is often not efficient when expressing eukaryotic membrane proteins  <cit> . yeasts have emerged as alternative hosts for expression, having the benefits of being inexpensive and easy to manipulate in addition to having the ability to grow to high cell densities  <cit> . furthermore, they possess the eukaryotic machinery for post translational modifications  <cit>  and the eukaryotic translocon complex  <cit>  that might be required for synthesis of a correctly folded and fully functional membrane protein.

the use of the methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris for heterologous protein production was developed in the 1980s  <cit>  and it has proven to be a successful host when overexpressing soluble proteins  <cit>  as well as several different classes of membrane proteins, including a peptide transporter  <cit> , ion channels  <cit> , ion pumps  <cit> , g-protein coupled receptors  <cit> , abc transporters  <cit>  and glucose transporters  <cit> . due to its ability to grow to high cell densities and to its exceptionally strong and inducible aox <dig> promoter  <cit> , p. pastoris has become a potent alternative to the more studied baker's yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae as a eukaryotic tool for recombinant protein production.

a number of factors can potentially affect the outcome of heterologous protein expression in p. pastoris, including the properties of the nucleotide sequence , mode of sequence insertion into the genome, choice of host strain, mode of expression, methanol utilisation phenotype and cultivation conditions  <cit> . it has however been stated that when expressing protein from a single recombinant gene copy, the transcript level is most likely to be limiting in the protein production. it is therefore suggested that insertion of multiple recombinant gene copies should be aimed for in order to obtain maximal protein yields  <cit> . when using a p. pastoris expression vector carrying the sh ble gene which encodes a protein conferring resistance towards the antibiotic zeocin, a selection on varying antibiotic concentrations can be applied, as described in the invitrogen easy select™ pichia expression kit manual  <cit> . the level of antibiotic resistance will reflect the number of plasmids that have been incorporated into the p. pastoris genome, that is, the recombinant gene dosage. numerous studies have shown that increased number of inserted sequences can indeed boost the heterologous expression of soluble proteins  <cit> . concerning membrane proteins, the correlation between increased recombinant gene dosage and protein expression is less well studied and the results obtained are contradictory. there is one report where increased gene dosage, as estimated by semi quantitative dna dot blotting, rendered significantly increased recombinant expression of a na+, k+ -atpase  <cit> . in two other expression studies on gpcr:s, limited  <cit>  or no  <cit>  effect of increasing recombinant gene dosage was seen, suggesting that other factors were limiting the steady state expression levels.

another class of membrane proteins that, in addition to the ones previously mentioned, has been successfully overexpressed in p. pastoris is the membrane intrinsic proteins , also called aquaporins  <cit> . members of this superfamily of integral membrane proteins are present in nearly all living organisms  <cit> . aquaporins are proteins with a number of functions, whereof the most significant one is the facilitation of water transport over the membranes of the cell and the maintenance of water homeostasis in the organism  <cit> . functional and structural studies have led to a broadening of the knowledge base around these proteins  <cit> . however, since many questions regarding the aquaporin function and structure remain unanswered and more studies are needed to complete the picture, convenient methods for routinely obtaining high expression levels of recombinant aquaporins in p. pastoris are desirable. moreover, since the aquaporins are integral, they can serve as model proteins for other membrane spanning proteins and methods developed based on recombinant aquaporin expression might hence be applicable also in a broader context.

in this study, we systematically investigate how recombinant gene dosage influences expression levels of both mammalian  and plant  aquaporins in p. pastoris. we show that increased copy number leads to elevated heterologous expression of all the four members of the aquaporin family studied. interestingly this includes atsip1; <dig>  for which expression appears to be restricted due to impaired transcription and translation. a screen for multiple copy integrants should hence be a part of the routine optimisation strategy when overexpressing aquaporins in this host. we also present a method for fast, cheap and reliable determination of integrated plasmid copy number using qpcr. this method makes it possible to easily characterise the transformants and to correlate expression levels with gene dosage which is valuable when trying to find the p. pastoris clones with optimal characteristics for heterologous protein expression.

RESULTS
expression analysis
since the level of resistance towards the antibiotic zeocin is supposed to reflect the number of inserted vector sequences in p. pastoris, and potentially also the level of expression, clones carrying recombinant dna encoding each of the four aquaporin isoforms were selected at varying zeocin concentrations. for each isoform, five clones  at each antibiotic resistance level were induced in small scale and crude cell extracts were analysed by immunoblotting using an antibody directed towards the c-terminal his-tag of the recombinant proteins. western blots from the small scale expression show a clear difference in expression levels among the different clones . although, there are large differences in expression levels between the different aquaporin family members  it is apparent that, for each individual isoform, the yeast cells selected on zeocin concentrations higher than  <dig> μg/ml generally express larger amounts of heterologous protein. one exception, however, are the sopip1;2-clones selected at  <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml zeocin which were obtained only after an extended incubation of the selection plates.

to verify that the elevated aquaporin expression of the clones with high zeocin resistance levels did not compromise the protein folding and the membrane insertion, a large scale expression test and subsequent membrane preparation was made of a clone expressing high levels of hsaqp <dig>  with a clone with modest expression  as a reference applying exactly the same protocol for both clones. to be able to directly compare the hsaqp <dig> content in the fractions derived from the hsaqp8:1000: <dig> and the hsaqp8:100: <dig> clones respectively, each fraction was diluted to a normalized volume prior to analysis with western blots. immunoblotting  showed that some protein was retained in the cell debris pellet , but that the majority of the protein was situated in the purified membrane . also at high expression levels, the protein formed the multimeric complexes characteristic of correctly folded aquaporins. for the hsaqp8:1000: <dig> clone, some faint but distinct bands also appeared in-between the bands corresponding to the aqp <dig> multimers and these could correspond to aqp <dig> protein subjected to post translational modifications. these were not seen when analyzing the fractions from the hsaqp8:100: <dig> clone, since significantly less aqp <dig> protein was present in these fractions.

analysis of copy number by qpcr
to be able to correlate the recombinant protein expression level with the number of inserted gene copies a method based on qpcr was developed. the method takes advantage of the fact that the aox <dig> tt region, that is part of the ppiczb plasmid, is incorporated in the p. pastoris genome together with the gene to be expressed. quantification of the aox <dig> tt region will hence give an indirect measurement of the recombinant gene dosage, independent of which protein is to be overexpressed.

the qpcr data shows, as expected, that the aquaporin gene copy number increases with elevated resistance towards zeocin . generally, clones selected on  <dig> μg/ml zeocin tend to harbour 1- <dig> copies of the inserted plasmid, selection on  <dig> μg/ml renders clones with 4- <dig> plasmid copies and selection on  <dig> μg/ml could give rise to clones with as many as  <dig> incorporated heterologous dna sequences. the analysis also shows that low copy sopip1; <dig> clones were recovered at high antibiotic concentrations indicating that the zeocin selection method used did not completely exclude the occurrence of so called false positives . when comparing the qpcr data with the expression levels of the different clones it is obvious that there is a correlation between gene dosage and recombinant protein expression level. the linear regression correlation coefficients  for hsaqp <dig>  hsaqp <dig>  sopip1; <dig> and atsip1; <dig> are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the low r <dig> value for hsaqp <dig> is due to the low expression of the high copy clone hsaqp5:1000: <dig> and without this data point the r <dig> value is  <dig> .

comparison of single copy aquaporin clones
in order to compare expression levels of different aquaporin isoforms, crude cell extracts from induced, potentially single copy, aquaporin clones were analysed on the same western blot . the blot shows similar expression levels of hsaqp <dig>  hsaqp <dig> and sopip1; <dig>  with the two human isoforms giving a slightly stronger signal. it is noticeable that one hsaqp5- and one hsaqp8-clone that had been designated copy numbers around  <dig>   are more likely to carry two copies of the respective genes, since they show significantly higher expression than the clones with copy numbers closer to one. the most prominent feature though is the poor expression of atsip1; <dig>  which monomer  is on the verge of detection.

quantification of atsip1; <dig> mrna and modification of the consensus start sequence
to investigate whether the poor atsip1; <dig> expression was caused by low transcript levels an mrna quantification experiment using qpcr was performed. the results, summarised in figure  <dig>  show that upon induction the single copy atsip1; <dig> clone  produces about  <dig> times less recombinant mrna as compared with the single copy hsaqp <dig> clone . however, the atsip1; <dig> transcript level is still more than  <dig> fold higher than that of actin, that was used as a reference.

since the atsip1; <dig> construct was cloned with restriction enzymes different from those used for the other three aquaporins, it differed from the consensus start sequence  <cit>  in one nucleotide . to investigate whether this deviation was causing the low atsip1; <dig> expression levels, a new construct carrying the consensus start sequence was made and protein expression of a clone selected on  <dig> μg/ml was compared with that of the atsip1;1:100: <dig> clone. expression increased slightly but was still poor as compared with that of the single copy hsaqp <dig> clone  that was included as a reference .

discussion
the methylotrophic yeast p. pastoris has, during the last decades, increased in popularity as a eukaryotic host for recombinant protein expression  <cit> . numerous reports have described successful overexpression of soluble proteins as well as of membrane proteins in this system, but sufficient protein yields have not always been obtained. several methods have been described that could be used to improve the outcome of expression trials, among which an optimisation of recombinant gene dosage has proven to be one of the most potent ones  <cit> . when it comes to the aquaporin family of membrane proteins, optimisation of the nucleotide sequence both regarding codon composition and at content  <cit>  and controlled growth in bioreactors  <cit>  have been reported to improve the yields of heterologous protein. however, in no reports has a systematic examination of the effect of gene dosage on recombinant aquaporin expression in p. pastoris been done and results obtained for other membrane proteins  <cit>  are based on less precise dna quantification methods. neither has transcript levels for different genes with the same promoter and copy number been compared. a better understanding of how these factors may affect the yield will facilitate the design of future membrane protein expression experiments.

as for many other proteins expressed in p. pastoris  <cit> , recombinant aquaporin expression was shown to be intimately connected to the level of resistance towards the antibiotic. in general clones selected at  <dig> or  <dig> μg zeocin/ml are more likely to express high levels of recombinant protein as compared with the ones selected at  <dig> μg/ml. in this study we chose to perform a two step antibiotic selection in order to take full advantage of all the clones generated in each transformation. by doing a first selection at  <dig> μg zeocin/ml all recombinant clones were recovered and these were then subjected to higher zeocin concentrations. the benefit of this method is that the risk of losing potential high expressing clones by subjecting them to lethal levels of antibiotic is eliminated. the drawback is that several clones from the same origin may be recovered during the second selection event, as possibly seen for the sopip1; <dig> clones .

the large scale membrane preparation from a clone expressing high levels of one of the aquaporins  showed that the folding and the targeting to the membrane seem to be unaffected by the increased work load that is put on the protein production and the membrane insertion machinery. comparison with a clone with low expression level showed that the majority of the protein ends up in the membrane fraction in both cases and, most importantly, that the membrane fraction from the highly expressing clone contains substantially larger amounts of recombinant protein . some degradation seems to occur and this could probably be avoided by optimisation of the cell breakage procedure or by expression in a protease deficient strain  <cit> . when combining the high amount of correctly folded and targeted protein in multi-copy transformants with the high cell densities obtained in bioreactor cultures, exceptional membrane protein yields could be achieved. this was seen for one multi-copy hsaqp <dig> clone with high levels of recombinant protein expression, where  <dig> mg of functional protein was purified from  <dig> l fermenter culture . protein from this clone was also used for crystallisation and rendered well ordered crystals diffracting to  <dig>  Å  <cit> , confirming the high quality of the expressed protein.

when copy number was determined it was confirmed that the variation in antibiotic tolerance was due to differences in recombinant gene dosage among the different clones. assuming that the sh ble gene is incorporated at the same ratio as the aox <dig> tt sequence it generally seems like the presence of  <dig> copy of the sh ble zeocin resistance gene is the minimum requirement for growth at  <dig> μg zeocin/ml,  <dig> copies at  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> copies at  <dig> μg/ml, but clones with as many as  <dig> gene copies were recovered from plates with the highest antibiotic concentration. the results obtained for the aquaporin isoforms included in this study suggest a trend between elevated gene dosage and increased recombinant expression, also for sopip1; <dig> where, even though only intermediate copy numbers were observed, expression increased by a factor of  <dig>  this is in accordance with the results obtained when expressing a na+k+-atpase  <cit> , but in contradiction with results from a gpcr expression trial  <cit> . thus it seems like the multi copy strategy may not be the universal solution to all problems encountered when trying to over express mp:s, since there may be several factors limiting the recombinant protein production. one such bottleneck might be a limitation of the membranes to accommodate the expressed protein, resulting in a maximal upper limit for protein expression when gene dosage is further increased. indeed, in our study we observe a plateau in the average expression when increasing gene copy number as exemplified by hsaqp <dig>  the average expression of the 500- and 1000-selected clones were determined to  <dig>  and  <dig>  arbitrary units, respectively when the corresponding average gene dosage increased from  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. still, a  <dig> fold increase in hsaqp <dig> expression level was obtained utilising the multi copy strategy. this demonstrates the potential of this method.

it is remarkable that from the  <dig> μg zeocin/ml selection, at least  <dig> out of  <dig> clones  proved to harbour more than one recombinant gene copy. this frequency of multiple gene insertion events is notably higher than the expected 1-10% suggested in the easyselect™ pichia expression kit manual . possibly this high multi-copy frequency could have arisen during the two step zeocin selection due to posttransformational vector amplification which has been reported to occur when subjecting recombinant p. pastoris clones to gradually increasing concentrations of antibiotic  <cit> . in that report posttransformational vector amplification upon recurring antibiotic selection lead to elevated gene dosage in 40% of the clones studied. that frequency is comparable with the 45% seen in this study.

one problem that is commonly encountered when expressing protein in p. pastoris is the occurrence of false positives, that is, clones that have the capacity to grow at high antibiotic levels but express little or no recombinant protein  <cit> . false positives were also observed in this study. for the clones carrying the sopip1; <dig> construct, five out of the ten clones selected at the three highest zeocin levels  showed little or no recombinant protein expression. qpcr results showed that two of these clones  carried only one copy of the sopip1; <dig> gene and three of them  were assigned copy numbers close to four. probably the three latter false positives have a common origin in a clone with faulty heterologous expression. since all sopip1; <dig> clones selected at  <dig> or  <dig> μg zeocin/ml were shown to harbour unexpectedly low numbers of integrated plasmid, the antibiotic selection for recovering multiple insertions seems to have failed. the only factor that differed in this selection as compared with the ones done for the other three constructs was the incubation time, which was increased from three to four days. possibly there was degradation of zeocin over time or this procedure favoured the selection of mutations that increased resistance in alternative ways, not coupled to gene copy number. regardless of the underlying mechanism it is apparent that extended incubation should be avoided in order to exclude the formation of false positives.

the results from the sopip1; <dig> selection emphasise the importance of evaluating the outcome of the antibiotic selection not only at the protein level, but also at the dna level, to ensure that the selection is efficient and that satisfactory gene dosage is obtained. if, as in the case with sopip1; <dig>  gene dosage turns out to be moderate one should consider redoing the transformation and selection in order to obtain clones with maximal gene dosage since they may be superior protein producers. the qpcr based method presented here offers a convenient and reliable means of characterizing recombinant p. pastoris clones and could be included in the standard protocols when screening for multi-copy transformants. the big advantage of this new method as compared with other qpcr based methods used to verify recombinant gene dosage in p. pastoris  <cit>  is its versatility. since the primers used are designed to amplify a part of the vector sequence rather than the specific gene, it can be used to quantify any recombinant gene sequence sitting in an expression vector carrying the aox <dig> tt sequence.

one of the aquaporins, atsip1; <dig>  proved to express very low levels of recombinant protein as compared with the other aquaporin isoforms. analysis of the atsip1; <dig> mrna levels showed that atsip1; <dig> transcripts were not as abundant as hsaqp <dig> transcripts. due to the presence of an ecori cleavage site within the atsip1; <dig> coding sequence, the ecori restriction enzyme could not, as for the other three aquaporin isoforms, be used when creating the atsip1; <dig> construct. it is possible that the deviating site of insertion into the expression vector had an impact on the mrna levels. however, atsip1; <dig> mrna levels were still considerably higher than these of actin. recombinant protein expression could hence be expected to be lower than that of hsaqp <dig> but should still be readily detectable with a western blot, unless there are obstructions in the translation that could contribute to the poor atsip1; <dig> expression. to exclude the possible adverse effects on translation of a deviation in the nucleotide sequence proximate to the start codon, a new construct carrying the correct p. pastoris consensus start sequence was made. this modification did not lead to significant improvement of the recombinant protein expression, and hence that factor was excluded as being a major obstacle to efficient recombinant atsip1; <dig> expression.

there are no other obvious features at the nucleotide level  that distinguish atsip1; <dig> from the other three aquaporin cdna sequences studied. however, the atsip1; <dig> protein is the most divergent isoform  and the only one of the four aquaporins that, natively, has been reported to reside in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> , whilst hsaqp <dig>  hsaqp <dig> and sopip1; <dig> have been shown to be localised to the plasma membrane  <cit> . it is possible that the atsip1; <dig> is also retained in the er in p. pastoris and that the accumulation of recombinant protein in these membranes limits the yield. whatever the reason for the poor atsip1; <dig> expression, the fact that it could, to some extent, be overcome by elevating the gene dosage is encouraging and emphasises the potency of the multi-copy selection procedure.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present a method based on qpcr to determine recombinant gene copy number, that facilitates the validation of the antibiotic selection and the characterisation of recombinant p. pastoris clones. employing this method we have systematically investigated factors that could influence recombinant aquaporin expression in p. pastoris. we conclude that expression of correctly folded and targeted aquaporins is strongly dependent on recombinant gene dosage and also that increasing the gene dosage could, to some extent, help improving poor expression caused by inefficiency at the transcriptional and translational levels.
