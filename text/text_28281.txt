BACKGROUND
with some  <dig> species, crotalaria occupies place  <dig> in a list of the world’s largest angiosperm genera  <cit> . of these genera, only four have been studied with a species sampling >30%, namely piper  with 31% of c.  <dig> species sampled  <cit> , allium  with 41% of c.  <dig> species sampled  <cit> , erica  with 45% of c.  <dig> species sampled  <cit> , and solanum  with 34% of c.  <dig> species sampled  <cit> , studying mega-diverse clades  is important for understanding plant evolution, especially the timing of geographic expansion and rate of trait change, which can be inferred from calibrated phylogenies. here we focus on crotalaria, a pantropical clade of woody or herbaceous species of low statue that mostly occur in open habitats at low to mid-altitudes and that have conspicuous flowers and fruits so that they are frequently collected and well represented in herbaria. understanding of crotalaria has benefitted from consistent taxonomic work by roger polhill  <cit>  and modern phylogenetic studies focusing on its african and indian species  <cit> . of the  <dig> species, about  <dig> occur in africa and madagascar,  <dig> in india,  <dig> in australia, and  <dig> in the americas  <cit> . about  <dig> species are distributed pantropically due to their use as fiber crops, cattle fodder, and erosion control plants  <cit> . the biosynthesis of pyrrolizidine alkaloids  in crotalaria root nodules depends on infection by rhizobial bacteria  <cit> . so far, this has been studied in only four species of crotalaria that turn out to be closely related , and knowing the earliest-diverging species of crotalaria, as well as the closest relatives of the genus, is required to infer when this trait may have evolved.


crotalaria species have typical papilionoid flowers, composed of standard, wing, and keel petals . these flowers are adapted to bee pollination and especially to megachilidae, a worldwide clade of some  <dig> species  <cit>  whose pollen-carrying structures are restricted to the ventral surface of the abdomen. this matches the ventral pollen presentation in crotalaria. the only way for a bee to reach the nectary at the base of a staminal tube is by inserting its proboscis through a central channel at the base of the standard petal. access to the nectary from the sides is blocked by bulbous or plate-like appendages at the inner base of the standard petal. pollen transfer occurs while the nectar-drinking bee grabs the lateral wing petals with its tarsi, depressing the flower’s keel with its body weight, which causes the style to emerge from the staminal tube through the keel beak  <cit> . fitting with the predominant bee pollination, crotalaria flowers are yellow, sometimes with red or brownish markings. few species have white, blue, or greenish flowers; an example of a green-flowered species is the australian c. cunninghamii, which presumably is pollinated by honeyeaters   <cit> .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood  tree for  <dig> accessions representing  <dig> species of crotalaria and  <dig> species of the remaining  <dig> genera of crotalarieae based on  <dig> aligned nucleotides of nuclear and plastid sequences. bootstrap support values for every node are shown in additional file 10: figure s <dig>  key flower traits plotted: keel beak , calyx , and length of calyx . formal ml state reconstructions  of the three traits on the chronogram  are shown in additional file 1: figures s <dig>  additional file 2: figure s <dig> and additional file 3: figure s <dig>  photos: a. rockinger




leaves in crotalaria are usually compound and trifoliolate, more rarely are they unifoliolate, multifoliolate, or simple. unifoliolate leaves differ from simple leaves in having an articulation at the leaflet base; they appear to be derived from trifoliolate leaves, judging from the occurrence on the same plant of trifoliolate and unifoliolate leaves . while the adaptive value of simple leaves remains unknown, that of compound leaves is thought to lie in heat dissipation because there is greater convection than in a simple leaf of equal size  <cit> . compound leaves also allow individual leaflets to change their angle of inclination and thereby maximize diffuse light capture at microsites, with the degree of folding also varying diurnally  <cit> . given that about 71% of the  <dig> crotalaria species have trifoliolate, unifoliolate, or multifoliolate leaves, while some 29% have simple leaves, we were interested in the regions and climates where simple and compound leaves would occur. our expectation was that compound leaves would have evolved in dry, hot areas and be absent or evolutionarily lost in humid climates.

chromosome counts have been published for about  <dig> species of crotalaria . while these data are sparse, analyzing them in a phylogenetic framework should allow an initial assessment of the role of chromosome number change in crotalaria.

here we use three plastid and two nuclear gene regions to reconstruct a phylogeny for representatives of all sections of crotalaria and of all  <dig> other genera of crotalarieae, a tribe with  <dig> species of mainly african distribution  <cit> . our aim was to identify major species groups and then to use phylograms and chronograms to infer the relative evolutionary lability of flower traits, chromosome numbers, and leaf morphology and to relate leaf type to climate, using georeferenced occurrences of as many of the sequenced species as available in the global biodiversity information facility .

RESULTS
closest relatives and age of crotalaria, and flower and leaf evolution in the genus
based on our sampling of  <dig>  of the  <dig> species of crotalaria and representatives of all relevant outgroup genera, the genus is monophyletic and most closely related to the african bolusia , followed by the monospecific likewise african euchlora . inferred ages for key divergence events under different clock models are summarized in table 1; their 95% posterior probability intervals overlap, suggesting that the results are robust to choice of priors. the stem age of crotalaria falls between the late oligocene and the early miocene, with the divergence from bolusia occurring  <dig>  to  <dig>  ma ago . the deepest divergences between surviving crotalaria lineages date to between  <dig>  and  <dig>  ma ago. bolusia and euchlora, as well as most other crotalarieae occur in africa, suggesting that crotalaria originated in africa. from there, madagascar was reached at least nine times , while australia was reached at least five times, three times from se asia and apparently also from africa, although denser species sampling would be required to confidently infer closest african/australian relatives.table  <dig> estimated mean node ages  for selected divergence events under different clock models. ages are in million years, and the values in brackets are the 95% posterior probability intervals

within crotalaria, large species groups have almost homogeneous flower morphologies . thus, bilabiate calyces  are almost restricted to asia, australasia, and the neotropics and are rare in africa , with a few reversals to equally lobed calyces, such as predominate in africa. of the  <dig> sampled species,  <dig>  have a spirally twisted keel beak and mostly belong to our ‘bilabiate calyx’ and ‘bulbous standard appendages’ clades . there is also a species group with truncate calyx tubes that largely corresponds to polhill’s  <cit>  section hedriocarpae ; most crotalaria have a campanulate calyx. our ‘core chrysocalycinae’ clade comprises most sampled species of polhill’s section chrysocalycinae and all grandiflorae  and stipulosae . the sister relationship between c. linearifoliolata from somalia and c. persica from the horn of africa to the arab peninsula will require renewed assessment of their morphologies; pohlhill  had placed them in his sections schizostigma and hedriocarpae. calyces shorter than keel petals are conserved in species groups within the ‘truncate calyx tube’ and the ‘bulbous standard appendages’ clades .

leaf architecture in crotalaria is highly conserved, as shown by both the ancestral state reconstruction  and the permutation test . all five species of the closest outgroup bolusia have compound  leaves, while the single species of euchlora, the next closest relative, has simple leaves. most simple-leaved crotalaria species belong to the ‘bilabiate calyx’ and the ‘core chrysocalycinae’ clades and thus are found outside africa . trifoliolate leaves predominate in african and madagascan species , while  <dig> of  <dig> sequenced asian species have simple leaves.fig.  <dig> ancestral state reconstruction for simple and compound  leaves under a symmetrical rates model, carried out on a chronogram resulting from a strict clock model implementing a fossil-based constraint for  <dig> crotalaria species,  <dig> species of other crotalarieae, and  <dig> species of the remaining genistoids. pie charts indicate ancestral state probabilities, and node bars 95% posterior probability intervals for nodes ≥ <dig>  posterior probability. the geological time scale is in million years and follows cohen et al.  <cit> . the fossil seedpod most closely resembles the genera bowdichia and diplotropis  <cit> . photo: p. s. herendeen. additional file 5: figure s <dig> shows the leaf states also coded for the outgroups




occurrences, climate, and leaf morphology
the  <dig>  georeferenced specimens in gbif representing  <dig> of the  <dig> species of crotalaria  show that the genus occurs in the tropics and subtropics and extends into mild temperate climates. of the species assignable to one of the four climate types based on the köppen-geiger system,  <dig> occur in the humid tropics,  <dig> in the dry tropics,  <dig> in the arid tropics, and  <dig> in the mild temperate climate . most  species occur at altitudes <1000 m; the highest median altitude of any crotalaria is that of c. cylindrica, for which this value is 2170 m in the highlands of the horn of africa  <cit> . our phylogeny includes an estimated 53% of all simple-leaved species and 47% of the compound-leaved species . the occurrence of simple- and compound-leaved species differs significantly between the humid tropics and the other three climate types  and slightly between arid and mild temperate regions .fig.  <dig>

from trifoliolate leaves, there were eight transitions to unifoliolate, four to multifoliolate, and four to simple leaves . the generalized linear, logistic regression, and ‘random forest’ models  confirmed that mean annual precipitation  has an effect on leaf type. according to the recursive partitioning analysis , of the  <dig> species occurring in drier regions , 13% have simple leaves; of the  <dig> species occurring in more humid climates , 41% have simple leaves; and of the  <dig> species occurring in very humid climates , 71% have simple leaves. when we incorporated the phylogenetic structure of the data in a binarypglmm model, the correlation between map and leaf types was not significant because of the few transitions between compound and simple leaves; when we experimentally increased the transition frequency by recoding compound-leaved species that occur in climates with mean annual precipitation >1250 mm as simple-leaved, we found that  <dig> transitions  were needed for a significant correlation between simple leaves and high precipitation.

polyploidy in crotalaria
we gathered chromosome numbers from the literature for  <dig> of the  <dig> sampled crotalaria species and plotted them on the phylogeny . the most common number in crotalaria is 2n =  <dig>  with  <dig> of the  <dig> species having this number. most polyploids are tetraploid , with 2n =  <dig>  and occur in the neotropics, where they belong to our ‘bilabiate calyx’ clade. exceptions are c. tweediana, a species with 2n =  <dig> and endemic to brazil, and c. ferruginea with 2n =  <dig> from southeast asia and australasia, and c. massaiensis with 2n =  <dig> from kenya.

discussion
phylogenetic relationships and major groups in crotalaria

crotalaria as traditionally circumscribed  <cit>  is monophyletic. morphologically, the five species in the tropical african genus bolusia differ from the  <dig> species of crotalaria by having a spirally coiled keel  and a single, rather than paired, appendages blocking the nectary access. the single species of euchlora, endemic to the northern and western cape and the next-closest relative, lacks any appendages. bolusia has trifoliolate leaves, while euchlora hirsuta has simple leaves. we have sampled between  <dig> and 79% of the species in polhill’s  <cit>  eight sections , and with this sampling all sections are polyphyletic. le roux et al.’s  <cit>  merging of polhill’s sections crotalaria and dispermae  is supported by our results . on the other hand, eight of their eleven sections are rendered polyphyletic by our increased species sampling , grandiflorae , and stipulosae  are monophyletic). a future sectional classification should probably not be undertaken until a higher percentage of the species is sampled .

evolution of flower and leaf traits and their distribution in different climate types
flower traits  turned out to be highly conserved, which may reflect that the main pollinators of crotalarias, species in the long-tongued bee family megachilidae with over  <dig>  species, are abundant in ecosystems from arid habitats to tropical forests  <cit> ). all crotalaria flowers, even the honeyeater-pollinated australian c. cunninghamii  <cit> , have the same pollination mechanism in which the narrow keel beak serves as a cylinder and the style acts together with the anthers as a piston. no study has compared the effect of a spirally twisted or straight keel beak on pollen release, and pohlhill’s  suggestion that a twisted keel beak might better proportion pollen release does not match the finding that flowers with and without such keels have the same short life span and are visited by some of the same bee species .

the range map  resulting from gbif occurrences of  <dig> species illustrates the distribution of the genus but also the uneven uploading of data to gbif, with india and maritime southeast asia especially underrepresented. of the  <dig> species, only  <dig> come from this region, and this may have affected the number of species assigned to the humid tropics. crotalaria likely originated in africa as inferred from both the almost exclusive african occurrence of its closest relatives and the greatest species diversity of crotalaria itself in savannas of the afromontane region in kenya, tanzania, and zambia, around lake tanganyika and lake victoria  <cit> . the ancestral leaf type in crotalaria is the trifoliolate compound leaf, the adaptive advantage of which is thought to lie in heat dissipation  <cit> ; the adaptive value of simple leaves remains unclear  <cit> . an unexpected finding in our study is that in crotalaria, simple leaves predominate in humid climates and unifoliolate leaves in dry climates, which points to a different adaptive value of these morphologies, regardless of whether these two leaf types evolved rarely or frequently in our focal group. the few state transitions combined with the binary coding of the four leaf types  required for the phylogenetically-informed statistical analyses precluded more fine-scale analysis, but with the now available phylogeny, crotalaria would be suitable for experimental work on the adaptive benefits of leaf architecture  <cit> .

polyploidy in crotalaria
tetraploidy in crotalaria appears to have arisen in the common ancestor of a new world clade . of the  <dig> neotropical species in our phylogeny,  <dig> form a clade that is embedded within a clade of  <dig> mostly asian species . of these  <dig>   <dig> have had their chromosome numbers counted, and all are polyploid . windler  <cit>  suggested that polyploidy might be related to self-compatibility, but selfing has been documented in all three species of crotalaria studied in this regard, c. micans, c. retusa, and c. stipularia  <cit>  and may characterize the entire genus. crotalaria stipularia is native to south america and tetraploid, but c. micans and c. retusa are both now pantropical in their distribution due to their use as fibre crops, green manure, and cattle fodder  <cit>  and are diploid . two  asian species close to the neotropical tetraploid clade, c. ferruginea and c. humifusa, also are polyploid as is c. massaiensis from kenya.

CONCLUSIONS
this study resolved the main species groups of the mega-diverse pantropical genus crotalaria, inferred the evolutionary frequency of change in its flower traits and leaf types, and provided a first view of the possible role of polyploidy in its evolution, based on a compilation of all available chromosome counts. the adaptive value of leaf types needs to be investigated experimentally, and such experiments will benefit from the phylogenetic framework provided here.
