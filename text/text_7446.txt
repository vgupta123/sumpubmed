BACKGROUND
the tomato pathogenic fungus fusarium oxysporum forma specialis lycopersisci  posses a two-partite genome. eleven of the  <dig> chromosomes of the sequenced strain  are syntenic with chromosomes of the sister species fusarium verticilloides and the more distantly related fusarium graminearum, displaying high sequence similarity and conservation of gene order  <cit> . these core chromosomes contain all housekeeping genes and few transposable elements . additionally, fol <dig> possesses four chromosomes that are devoid of housekeeping genes and accommodate 74% of the whole genome te content and 95% of the class ii tes . the four chromosomes and two smaller regions at the ends of two core chromosomes comprise the lineage-specific  part of the fol genome. the genes encoded in ls regions differ in their phylogenetic history from the genes on the core chromosomes  <cit> . the term lineage-specific  reflects the largely clonal structure of the fo species complex. fo reproduces asexually and consists of many clonal lineages, which, if pathogenic, are grouped into host-specific formae speciales   <cit> . while some ff. spp. are monophyletic, others are composed of several clonal lineages that appear to have independently acquired the ability to infect the same host plant  <cit> . this polyphyletic origin was likely caused by horizontal transfer of chromosomes encoding host specific virulence genes between fo lineages, thereby allowing the distinction of members of a f. sp., not by overall genetic relatedness, but by the presence or absence of certain ls chromosomes  <cit> .

in fol, one ls chromosome  largely defines the pathogenic phenotype of this f. sp., i.e. the ability to cause wilt disease in tomato. horizontal transfer of this pathogenicity chromosome from a tomato pathogenic isolate to a non-pathogenic isolate during co-cultivation resulted in novel tomato-pathogenic lineages, demonstrating that it contains genes that promote infection of tomato  <cit> . among these genes are all known fol <dig> effector genes called six  genes. like many other plant pathogens, fol utilizes small, secreted proteins to promote virulence by manipulating its plant host and suppressing host defense responses, typically through interaction with host proteins  <cit> . six proteins are small, commonly cysteine-rich, lack homology to other proteins and have a signal peptide for secretion  <cit> . six of the seven previously described six proteins are encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome; the genomic location of six <dig>  whose gene product is recognized by the tomato resistance proteins i and i- <dig>  is unknown because it is not present in the sequenced race  <dig> isolate fol <dig>  although six genes were likely acquired by horizontal transfer of the pathogenicity chromosome, they are not functionally independent of the core genome. their expression requires the transcription factor sge <dig> , which is encoded on a core chromosome  <cit> . it is unknown whether sge <dig> regulates six gene expression directly or indirectly, for example through the action of other transcription factors.

effector genes in other plant pathogens, such as magnoporthe oryzae, leptosphaeria maculans or phythophthora infestans, are also found proximal to tes and tes have been proposed as the underlying agents that provide a plastic environment for the emergence of new virulence traits  <cit> . the potential of tes to affect genome structure is a consequence of both their mobility and their inherent structure. generally, two different te classes are distinguished by their transposition intermediate: rna or dna. class i tes  transpose via a “copy-paste mechanism” by copying themselves into an rna-intermediate before inserting at a new site, while class ii tes  leave the donor site to reintegrate at another site via a “cut-paste mechanism”, although the original copy can also be retained  <cit> . class i tes are either flanked by terminal inverted repeats , long terminal repeats  or simple non-coding regions. class ii tes are usually flanked by tirs  <cit> . special te families are the mites , non-autonomous class ii tes of short length, which are thought to have evolved from autonomous tes by deletion of their transposase orf  <cit> . recombination between identical or highly similar tes can cause structural rearrangements like deletions, inversions, duplications and translocations depending on the orientation and genomic location of the recombining te members  <cit> . for an asexual fungus like fol, te-mediated recombination might represent a mechanism to create genetic variation in the absence of meiotic recombination. next to gross structural rearrangements, tes also contribute to evolution of novel phenotypes by transposition into new sites. for example, insertion of the hat transposase drifter into the coding sequence of an ancestral six <dig> homolog  disrupted the open-reading frame  of six1-h, thus creating an effector pseudogene  <cit> . in another case, insertion of a hornet-like transposon at the six <dig> locus of a japanese race  <dig> fol isolate created a fusion protein, which was no longer recognized by the corresponding i- <dig> tomato resistance protein  <cit> . te insertion might also influence gene expression when it occurs within a promoter.

to further our understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity of fol towards tomato, we conducted a detailed annotation of the predicted proteins encoded by the fol pathogenicity chromosome. in addition, to advance our understanding of the potential role of the genomic context of effector genes in gene evolution or expression, we also annotated tes on this chromosome. we thus obtained a detailed picture of the genomic landscape of the pathogenicity chromosome. within this te-rich landscape, we recognized mini-clusters of six genes. six genes are associated with two mites: a mimp upstream in all cases and, frequently, an mfot <dig> downstream. using promoter deletions at two six gene loci, we studied the influence of the mimp on six gene expression. finally, we were able to exploit the consistent presence of a mimp in the promoters of six genes and other virulence-associated genes to develop a method to identify candidate effector genes in f. oxysporum.

RESULTS
non-te genes on the fol pathogenicity chromosome group into a small set of functional classes
non-te orfs occupy only 13% of the dna space on the pathogenicity chromosome of fol, which consists of four supercontigs   in the most recent fol genome assembly . most of the manually curated  <dig> non-te orfs on this chromosome encode proteins of unknown function, which are annotated as hypothetical proteins or proteins with domains of unknown function . some of these unknown proteins have homologous sequences in f. oxysporum or in other fungi . two functional groups stand out among the predicted products of the remaining  <dig> non-te orfs: secreted proteins  and proteins involved in secondary metabolism . other functional groups include transcription factors , proteins with nucleic acid related functions , heterokaryon incompatibility  proteins , transporters , cyclins  and other intracellular functions , such as gtpases and protein kinases . as reported by ma et al., there are no genes for housekeeping proteins on the pathogenicity chromosome  <cit> . among the predicted secreted proteins, we find nine secreted enzymes, such as oxidoreductase, chitinase and glucanase, and  <dig> secreted proteins of unknown function. sixteen of the latter encode proteins smaller than  <dig> amino acids. among those are the previously described effector genes six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig> and six <dig> <cit> . proteins encoded on the fol pathogenicity chromosome that are likely involved in secondary metabolism  <cit>  include methyl transferases , cytochrome p450s  and glycosyltransferases . a putative secondary metabolite gene cluster on sc <dig> includes genes for three cytochrome p450s, a glycosyltransferase, a methyltransferase, a squalene-hopene cyclase and a homolog of tri <dig>  an acetyltransferase that is part of the trichothecene gene cluster in gibberella zeae <cit> . the genes in this putative secondary metabolite cluster are expressed during tomato infection  and might therefore be important for pathogenicity of the fungus.

currently, it is not known how f. oxysporum can transfer chromosomes horizontally from one strain to another. one hypothesis is that horizontal chromosome transfer  occurs via anastomosis tubes – specialized, unbranched tubes that connect conidia or hyphae  <cit> . anastomosis tubes result in heterokaryon formation between two fungal individuals  <cit> . this heterokaryon is only viable if the individuals have the same het  genotype; otherwise it undergoes a characteristic cell death reaction called an incompatibility reaction  <cit> . four genes on the pathogenicity chromosome encode proteins with similarity to het proteins in other fungi . het proteins like het-e from podospora anserina often harbor nacht  domains, or a highly divergent nucleoside phosphorylase  linked with protein-binding modules such as ankyrin repeats  <cit> . foxg_ <dig> encodes a protein with a nacht domain, foxg_ <dig> a protein with a pfs domain and ankyrin repeats, foxg_ <dig> a protein with a pfs, an atpase and ankyrin repeats and foxg_ <dig> a protein with pfs and ankyrin repeats . the presence of het-like genes on the pathogenicity chromosome may be seen to contradict hct via anastomosis tubes, because additional het loci would raise the chance of incompatibility between strains, involving programmed cell death of fused compartments. on the other hand, incompatibility does not appear to be a barrier to hct  <cit> . moreover, we do not know whether the het-like genes on the pathogenicity chromosome are really involved in incompatibility.

since transfer of the pathogenicity chromosome is sufficient to confer pathogenicity towards tomato, the virulence genes on it must be expressed in the new host strain. we know that there is crosstalk between the core and pathogenicity chromosome, because the core chromosome-encoded sge <dig> controls six gene expression  <cit> . the presence of eleven genes encoding transcription factors on the pathogenicity chromosome suggests that transcription of genes on the pathogenicity chromosome may also be controlled by the chromosome itself. among the transcription factors encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome are three copies of ftf <dig>  which is induced upon plant infection  <cit> , suggesting that at least a subset of the transcription factors encoded on the pathogenicity chromosome may be required for transcriptional reprogramming during plant infection.

next to transcription factors, nine other genes encode proteins with nucleic acid-related functions . most of these proteins are predicted to function in structural rearrangements of dna or in chromatin modifications. foxg_ <dig> encodes a poly-ribose polymerase  which binds to damaged or single-stranded dna to recruit dna repairing enzymes  <cit> . other genes encode putative components of the rna silencing machinery, including closely spaced genes for an rna-dependent rna polymerase , an rna interference and gene silencing protein  and a rnaseh domain-containing protein . foxg_ <dig> encodes a protein homologous to the eukaryotic conserved kinetochore protein mis <dig> that is involved correct segregation of daughter chromatids during mitosis and meiosis  <cit> . foxg_ <dig> encodes a protein with a bah  domain which may interact with gene silencing components  <cit> . similarly, foxg_ <dig> encodes a chromodomain protein that typically recruits protein complexes to chromatin and reads the epigenetic code by recognizing lysine methylation  <cit> . proteins involved in chromatin modification and rna interference might influence gene expression during pathogenicity.

the fol pathogenicity chromosome harbours a large diversity of transposable elements
to exhaustively identify tes and te relics on the fol pathogenicity chromosome, we performed a self-blastn of the genome sequence, then identified multi-copy sequences and sorted them into non-redundant families. secondly, we looked for inverted repeats  of at least  <dig> bp encompassing at most  <dig> kb of sequence. this expanded the set of identified tes relative to an initial survey  <cit> . taken together, tes occupy about twice as much  chromosomal dna space as non-te orfs .

both class i and class ii tes  are present in approximately equal numbers  on the pathogenicity chromosome, which is surprising because retrotransposons often dominate the te fraction of a given genome  <cit> . for annotation of the te classes we followed the classification system proposed by wicker and colleagues that comprises both mechanistic and enzymatic criteria  <cit> . class i tes all transpose by transcribing themselves into an rna intermediate, then reverse-transcribing the rna by a te-encoded reverse transcriptase and inserting into a new genomic region. there are three orders of class i tes: long-terminal-repeat  tes, long-interspersed nuclear elements  and short interspersed nuclear elements .

 <dig> designations in bold letters indicate tes that have been described in fusarium oxysporum before.

ltr retrotransposons are similar to retroviruses and encode multiple enzymatic domains including gag , protease, rnaseh, reverse transcriptase and integrase, flanked by long terminal repeats  <cit> . within the ltr order we identified members of the gypsy/ty <dig>  and copia/ty <dig>  superfamilies, a novel class i te named yaret <dig>  which encodes integrase , rnaseh , reverse transcriptase  and a zinc-finger  domain, as well as two novel solo-ltr families. solo-ltrs can be the result of intrachromosomal or intraelement recombination between the ltrs, thereby removing the internal domains and creating a solo ltr at the excision site  <cit> . several of these ltr transposons have been previously recognized in fo or in other pathogenic fungi. nht <dig>  for example, is also present on a ls chromosome of fusarium solani <cit> .

line elements lack the ltrs that are characteristic for the retroviral-like class i tes. in this order we identified  <dig> mgr583-like elements and  <dig> yaret <dig> and yaret1-like elements . mgr <dig> accompanies the effector gene avr-pita in some m. oryzae isolates  <cit> . the latter two are novel lines. foxy  represents the only te of the sine class on the pathogenicity chromosome. foxy appears to be an active te that is specific for fusarium species  <cit> . foxy elements are the most abundant class i tes in fol and they are evenly distributed over the pathogenicity chromosome and also throughout core chromosomes  <cit>  . this dispersed distribution pattern is also apparent for the other class i tes. finally, we detected  <dig> copies of marsu, which is a retrotransposon that cannot be classified as ltr, line or sine. copies of marsu were first described in fo f. sp. phaseoli where they were found downstream of the ftf <dig> gene  <cit> . ramos et al. speculated that the marsu element might be responsible for gene duplication events of ftf <dig> <cit> . for most retrotransposon classes on the pathogenicity chromosome, we find only few full-length copies. marsu is the marked exception: seven of the ten copies are full-length. marsu copies are present in other fol <dig> ls regions, and two copies reside on core chromosomes. although we did not detect identical copies within the genome sequence of fol <dig>  the presence of moderately divergent copies and many full-length copies suggest that marsu elements have been active relatively recently.

compared to class i elements, class ii elements are less evenly distributed on the chromosome and many aggregate in large chromosomal subregions . class ii elements are divided into two subclasses. among subclass i we identified one crypton copy. cryptons encode a tyrosine-recombinase to cut and rejoin recombining dna strands. they were first identified in human pathogenic fungi and were later found to be domesticated in vertebrates  <cit> . there are more crypton copies present on other ls chromosomes, but none on core chromosomes. within subclass ii we identified nine helitron copies. helitrons are unusual class ii te; instead of a ‘cut and paste’ mechanism they transpose via a rolling-circle mechanism  <cit> . with this transposition mechanism they often capture host genes and thus contribute to genome evolution  <cit> . at least eight of the nine helitron copies on the pathogenicity chromosome are intact; one is truncated by a sequence gap . all copies are 99-100% identical in sequence, and there are intact helitron copies on core chromosomes, suggesting that helitrons are still active.

the best-represented order of class ii tes are the terminal inverted repeat  tes . these tes consists of a transposase orf flanked by tirs  <cit> . among the tc1/mariner superfamily, we found multiple, diverse fot lineages belonging to the pogo family. this finding confirms the previously shown preferred localization of pogo elements on ls chromosomes  <cit> . we observed a similar diversification of hop elements belonging to the mutator family. five hop classes are present with one to  <dig> copies, most of which are not full-length, although hop has been shown to be active in fo <cit> . most te families, including three folyt copies and  <dig> hornet copies, belong to the hat family. folyt has been identified as an expressed and active transposable element in fol by transposon trapping  <cit> . hornet <dig> was discovered during analysis of transposons in fo f. sp. melonis <cit> . the only copy of the hat transposon drifter adjoins the truncated effector gene six1-h <cit> . overall, as previously shown for some genomic regions in fom, class ii tes seem to preferentially insert into or close to each other, creating class ii te-enriched subregions on the fol pathogenicity chromosome.

these subregions are also enriched for mites. mites are non-autonomous tes, which basically consist of tirs flanking a short non-coding dna sequence. three different classes of mites are present on the pathogenicity chromosome:  <dig> mimps , three gimlis and  <dig> mfot5s . mites require an associated transposase for transposition. often, this associated transposase has similar tirs  <cit> . for mfot <dig> transposition, two tes encoding intact fot <dig> transposases on the pathogenicity chromosome might facilitate transposition. mimps are transposed by the impala transposase, which was shown to be active in the melon pathogenic strain fo f. sp. melonis by transposon tagging  <cit> . however, in fol <dig> all three impala copies, which reside on the pathogenicity chromosome, do not encode a full-length transposase, suggesting that mimps are presently not actively transposed in fol <dig>  the large diversification of the mimp lineages with members of more than four families and without two identical copies also suggests that mimps are not presently active in fol <dig> 

mimps are associated with promoters of six genes
six genes tend to reside in chromosomal subregions that are enriched for class ii tes, sometimes as mini-clusters . for example, six <dig> and six <dig> form a mini-cluster with one intervening gene ) and two intervening mimps, flanked by another mimp and a fot <dig> . six <dig> and six <dig> form another mini-cluster with an intervening mimp, with nearby mfot <dig> and fot <dig> fragments. this mini-cluster is flanked on both sides by inverted repeats, suggesting that this mini-cluster might be able to be transposed .

a closer inspection of the six gene promoters, which we pragmatically define as  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon, revealed the presence of a mimp in the promoters of six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig> and six <dig> . the mimp in the six <dig> locus was revealed by re-sequencing, because in the fol <dig> genome assembly there is a sequence gap upstream of the six <dig> orf. another sequence gap separates a mimp from six <dig>  we were not able to bridge this gap by pcr and therefore cannot rule out that the distance between the mimp and six <dig> is bigger than  <dig>  kb or that there is another mimp present that is closer to the six <dig> start codon. the avirulence gene six4/avr <dig> of race  <dig> fol strains, which is not present in fol  <dig> , also harbors a mimp in its promoter sequence . the pathogenicity chromosome harbors more than half of the mimps present in the fol <dig> genome . the other copies are mainly present on the three other ls chromosomes with the exception of four mimps on core chromosomes, as observed before  <cit> . only a subset of the mimps on the pathogenicity chromosome is present in putative promoters . while six1- <dig> all harbor a mimp in their promoter, only  <dig> % of all annotated non-te orfs on the pathogenicity chromosome do so. this association of mimps with six gene promoters is highly significant . additional annotated orfs with a mimp in the promoter region encode a bzip transcription factor, an integral membrane protein, an alpha-n glucosaminetransferase, the ftf <dig> transcription factor , a catalase-peroxidase, the oxidoreductase orx <dig>  a homolog of the verticillium dahliae avirulence protein ave <dig>  a methyltransferase, a cytochrome p <dig> and a squalene-hopene cyclase. the latter three genes belong to the putative secondary metabolite cluster that is co-expressed during plant infection . likewise, ftf <dig> has previously been shown to be expressed during plant infection  <cit> . the catalase-peroxidase and orx <dig> are secreted in the xylem sap of fol-infected tomato plants  <cit>  . overall, therefore, mimps seem to be preferentially associated with the promoters of genes that are expressed during plant infection.

to see whether additional, potentially regulatory elements may be enriched in six gene promoters, we analyzed the promoter sequences of six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig> and six <dig> for enriched k-mers. several overlapping  <dig> to 9mers were significantly enriched within these promoters. the most frequent of these form the sequence tcggcagtt . perfect matches to this sequence are present in the six <dig> and six3/six <dig> promoters. compared to the entire gene set of the fol <dig> genome, the association between the presence of at least one or two of the 6mers tcggca, ggcagt and the 7mer ggcagtt and the  <dig> bp upstream region of effector genes appears to be significant .

finally, we also examined the  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codons of six genes. mfot <dig> is present downstream of six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig> and six <dig> . the association of this mite with the six genes is weaker than the mimp association with the six gene promoters, because it is not present downstream of all the six genes on the pathogenicity chromosome.

six <dig> gene expression is not dependent on the presence of a mimp in the promoter
we next wanted to know whether the mimp or the putative regulatory elements enriched in the six gene promoters are directly involved in transcriptional regulation of the six genes. to test this, we designed two constructs to replace different parts of the six <dig> promoter with a hygromycin resistance cassette. both deletion constructs included the mimp, the difference between the constructs being that the six1p <dig> construct  deletes only three of the six conserved six gene promoter  <dig> mers, while the six1p <dig> construct  deletes five of these  <dig> mers .

first, we tested whether six <dig> was still expressed in the promoter deletion strains in vitro. most six genes are not highly expressed in vitro, their expression is only switched on upon plant infection. however, a low amount of six <dig> transcript is detectable in vitro <cit> . to our surprise, six <dig> was expressed in both six1p <dig> and six3p <dig> promoter deletion strains despite the absence of a large part of the six <dig> upstream region .

six <dig> is recognized by the tomato resistance protein i- <dig> and triggers disease resistance in tomato plants carrying the i-3-gene, thereby prohibiting extensive fungal infection  <cit> . upon plant infection, six <dig> was only expressed from strains with the shorter six1p <dig> deletion in both susceptible and resistant tomato cultivars. all transformed strains remained pathogenic towards tomato without fol resistance genes, indicating that they were not affected in pathogenicity . consistent with the in planta expression pattern, only the wild type and strains with the six1p <dig> promoter deletion were avirulent on the resistant tomato cultivar. in contrast, i- <dig> tomato cultivars that were infected with fol strains carrying the six3p <dig> promoter deletion were diseased, indicating the absence or reduced accumulation of the six <dig> avirulence protein . taken together, deletion of the mimp did not impair six <dig> expression in vitro or in in planta and this mimp is therefore not required for transcriptional regulation of the six <dig> gene. however, a promoter region including two tcggca elements appears to be required for six <dig> expression during plant infection.

six3/six <dig> promoter deletions reveal complex regulation at this locus
to further investigate the functional role of mimps in effector gene expression, we also designed promoter deletion constructs for the six3-six <dig> locus. six <dig> and six <dig> share the same  <dig> bp upstream sequence. this bidirectional promoter allowed us to test the expression of two different six genes with the same promoter deletion constructs. like six <dig>  six <dig> is also recognized by a tomato resistance protein, i- <dig> in this case, and expression of six <dig> and six <dig> is low but detectable in vitro <cit> . we designed three promoter deletion constructs: six3p <dig> , six3p <dig>  and six3p <dig> . six3p <dig> deletes six of the nine tcggca elements, but does not include the mimp, six3p <dig> includes the six tcggca elements and the mimp and six3p <dig> additionally deletes one more tcggca element . again, none of these promoter deletions impairs expression of six <dig> or six <dig> in vitro . during plant infection, a reduced level of six <dig> mrna was detected in fol strains carrying the six3p <dig> deletion, but not in strains with the six3p <dig> deletion. six <dig> is not expressed in either six3p <dig> or six3p <dig> deletion strains . remarkably, both six <dig> and six <dig> are expressed during plant infection in fol strains carrying the most extensive promoter deletion, six3p <dig> . with one exception, all tested strains were still able to cause disease on susceptible tomato cultivars and are thus not generally impaired in pathogenicity . only strains with the six3p <dig> deletion trigger a resistance response in tomato plants carrying the i- <dig> resistance gene, while the fol strains with the six3p539and six3p <dig> promoter deletions break i-2-mediated resistance, consistent with the six <dig> protein not being produced by these strains . although in the fol strains carrying the six3p <dig> promoter deletion a residual amount of six <dig> transcript is present, these strains are virulent. this may be explained by the additional requirement of six <dig> for i-2-mediated resistance .

from this set of experiments in two six gene loci, we can conclude that the mimps are not required for regulation of six gene expression. on the other hand, deletion of a short region containing a single tcggca element in the promoter of six <dig> abolishes six <dig> expression suggesting that this motif might represent a transcription factor-binding site . in contrast, at the six3-six <dig> locus additional deletion of a region containing the same motif restores expression of both six <dig> and six <dig> during plant infection .

the presence of mimps in the promoters of six genes enables prediction of novel effector candidates
next, we wanted to test whether we can use the consistent presence of a mimp in the upstream region of the six genes to predict novel effector candidates. we searched the fol <dig> genome for the presence of a mimp tir within  <dig> kb upstream of an orf encoding a protein with an n-terminal signal peptide for secretion . we also analyzed the xylem sap proteome of fol-infected tomato plants by mass spectrometry to see which of the predicted effectors are secreted by the fungus during plant infection.

by the in silico search for mimp-association we predicted  <dig> effector genes in fol <dig>  which are located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these include three of the known six genes on the pathogenicity chromosome: six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig> and six <dig> were not identified because of sequencing gaps in the fol <dig> genome assembly . six <dig> is a small gene comprising three exons. the first exon is unusually short and ends directly after the encoded signal peptide for secretion. therefore, six <dig> escaped signal peptide prediction  and thus was not identified with our approach.

besides the known six genes, we identified nine genes coding for small secreted proteins and four genes coding for secreted enzymes with a mimp in the upstream region . the latter comprise several multi-copy genes in the fol <dig> genome: two  orx <dig> copies, two copies of a gene coding for a catalase-peroxidase, two copies of a gene coding for a metalloprotease and three copies of a gene coding for an endo-polygalacturonase . both orx <dig> and the catalase-peroxidase proteins were identified with mass spectrometry in the xylem sap of fol-infected tomato plants, suggesting that they may play a role during plant infection.

 <dig> distance between the mimp ir and the atg start codon.

 <dig> predicted signal peptide.

 <dig> not identified because of a sequence gap in the genome assembly.

 <dig> not identified because of a short first exon.

 <dig> not identified due to absence of a signal peptide.

next to these two enzymes, we obtained protein sequences for four of the nine predicted effector proteins from the xylem sap proteome. additionally, we identified three more small proteins in the xylem sap of infected tomato plants that were not predicted by our in silico search. we named the genes for which we found the protein products in xylem sap six <dig> - six14; one additional gene we named six8b for its high similarity to six <dig> . upon inspection of the regions upstream of their respective genes we could always identify a mimp. six <dig>  six <dig> and six <dig> were not found with the in silico search because no signal peptide was detected. similar to six <dig>  six <dig> and six <dig> have a short first exon and therefore the signal peptide was not recognized by signalp. six <dig> is an unusual effector gene: it does not encode a protein with a canonical signal peptide for secretion.

in contrast to the other six genes in fol, six <dig> is not a single gene, but is present in two copies on the pathogenicity chromosome  and in subtelomeric regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in a repeated block of around  <dig> bp. this block includes incomplete copies of the class ii tes marsu and yahat <dig>  a foxy and a gene encoding an unknown protein . the repeated sequences flanking the six <dig> genomic block on sc <dig> suggest that six <dig> is present in a subtelomeric region. furthermore, two copies of a related gene, six8b, are present on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> each in the fol <dig> genome. in total, there are nine six <dig> and four six8b copies in the fol <dig> genome sequence. both six <dig> and six8b appear to be preceded by a complex structure of  mimps and mimp irs .

like the six1- <dig> genes described above, the newly identified six genes, as well as several additional potential effector genes for which we did not find evidence for expression in planta, reside in class ii te-rich subregions . six <dig> resides in a region that includes six <dig>  three genes coding for conserved secreted proteins, one gene for a mfs transporter and one for a fumarate reductase/succinate dehydrogenase, a ftf <dig> homolog and the orx <dig> gene. six <dig> is part of a cluster containing six <dig>  ssh <dig> and six <dig> . six <dig> and six <dig> make up a mini-cluster with six <dig>  similar to the six3/six <dig> mini-cluster, six <dig> is flanked on both sides by inverted repeats, suggesting that it may be mobilized by a transposase that recognizes these irs. six <dig>  is part of a duplicated region on chromosome  <dig> , which is different from the interchromosomal duplication shared with chromosome  <dig> 

taken together, we have developed a method to predict novel effector genes in genomes of f. oxysporum based only on the following characteristics:  coding for small, secreted proteins,  harboring mimps or inverted repeats of mimps within  <dig> kb upstream of the start codon. we validated this method by mass spectrometric analysis of the xylem sap of fol-infected tomato plants and confirmed in planta secretion of several predicted novel candidate effectors. these novel six genes represent ideal candidates for functional analysis.

discussion
effector genes on the fol pathogenicity chromosome are associated with chromosomal subregions enriched in class ii transposable elements
tes dominate the fol pathogenicity chromosome with large aggregates of class ii tes and more evenly distributed class i tes. interspersed within this te-rich landscape are mostly single non-te orfs, a putative secondary metabolite cluster and the six gene mini-clusters. in many plant and fungal species with expanded genomes, retrotransposons are mainly responsible for genome expansion. their mode of replication, which involves creating new copies during every transposition cycle, can rapidly increase genome size. often, a single or few class i tes account for the majority of tes present in a genome. the maize genome, for example, consists of 76% class i tes, with the gypsy family element huck and the copia element ji together accounting for nearly one quarter of the genome sequence  <cit> . similarly, in the obligate fungal pathogen blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, the class i te i  alone occupies  <dig> % of the entire genome space  <cit> . on the fol pathogenicity chromosome, we do not observe such a massive expansion of retrotransposons. instead, large aggregates of class ii tes are associated with genes involved in pathogenicity, such as the six gene mini-clusters. the tendency of class ii tes to concentrate in subchromosomal regions might result from recombination of their irs with irs of the same or a similar te family. occasionally, six genes might be trapped between the irs and subsequently transposed together with the te, resulting in the observed presence of six genes within class ii te-enriched chromosomal subregions. support for this hypothesis stems from the observation that irs directly flank six <dig> and the six3/six <dig> mini-cluster, although the transposase recognizing these irs remains unknown. similarly, the highly dynamic genomic location of the small, subtelomeric gene family avr-pita within the m. oryzae population has been attributed to the retrotransposons inago- <dig> and inago- <dig>  which flank avr-pita. these are thought to be involved in multiple translocation events of avr-pita, thereby facilitating a cycle of loss and gain of recognition by rice cultivars encoding the cognate pita resistance protein  <cit> . next to retrotransposons, some dna transposons have also been observed proximal to fungal effector genes. in leptosphaeria maculans, putative effectors are clustered in at-blocks together with three significantly over-represented tes   <cit> . clustering of virulence genes might provide a selective advantage, because all captured genes experience the same genomic environment, e.g. an open or closed chromatin structure, thereby being simultaneously amenable for transcriptional regulation  <cit> . this might facilitate coordinated gene expression during plant infection.

mites and fol evolution
mimps are always found within  <dig> bp upstream the translation start site of six genes as well as upstream of several other genes that are expressed during plant infection. mimps are uniformly small in size, ranging from  <dig> –  <dig> bp. their central region has no coding capacity and is flanked by ~ <dig> bp tirs that resemble the tirs of the tc1/mariner transposase impala  <cit> . impalas have been shown to transpose mimps in a heterologous system  <cit> . however, none of the impala copies in the fol genome are intact, suggesting that mimps are not currently transposed in fol <dig>  in the past there appear to have been several bursts of mimp amplification resulting in at least six mimp subfamilies present in fol <cit> . strikingly, more than half of the mimps in fol <dig> are present on the pathogenicity chromosome and the other mimps, with four exceptions, are restricted to the ls regions   <cit> .

mfot5s reside downstream of the six1/ssh1/six <dig>  the six3/six <dig> and the six10/six12/six <dig> mini-clusters as well as downstream of the solo six <dig> gene . mfot <dig> is also part of the putative secondary metabolite cluster that is co-expressed during fol infection of tomato plants . downstream of six <dig> is no mfot <dig>  but a full-length fot <dig>  the same is true for orx <dig>  which encodes an oxidoreductase that is secreted by fol during tomato infection. mfot <dig> is a pogo-like mite, less than  <dig> bp long with tirs similar to those of the fot <dig> transposon. in contrast to the lack of intact impalas for mimp transposition, fol <dig> possesses around  <dig> intact fot <dig> transposase orfs that could mobilize mfot5s  <cit> .

what could be the function of mimps in promoters of effector genes?
strikingly, mimps are not only present in six gene promoters, but also in the promoters of several other genes that are expressed during plant infection. among these are the gene for the oxidoreductase orx <dig> and two genes of the presumptive secondary metabolite gene cluster. one possible scenario is that the mimp is a domesticated te, which has adopted a function as transcription factor binding site, perhaps for sge <dig>  the transcription factor regulating six gene expression  <cit> . we tested this by deleting fragments of varying length in the promoter of six <dig> and the bidirectional, shared promoter of six <dig> and six <dig>  in a strain in which the mimp in the promoter of six <dig> was deleted , six <dig> expression in vitro and in planta was the same as in wild type. likewise, six <dig> and six <dig> expression was not affected in a strain in which the mimp was absent in their shared upstream region . therefore, we can rule out a direct involvement of the mimp in transcriptional regulation of six gene expression.

we did, however, observe that the presence or absence of other promoter regions affect gene expression at the six <dig> and the six3/six <dig> locus. by comparing two different promoter deletions, we found that six <dig> expression in planta requires a  <dig> bp region that includes one of the conserved tcggca elements that we found to be enriched in the six gene promoters . in contrast, six <dig> and six <dig> are not expressed from the two shorter promoter deletion strains, but expression of both genes is restored in the strain with the longest promoter deletion. the longest deletion additionally includes one of the tcggca elements , which in this instance may mediate the action of a transcriptional repressor. the association of this element with upstream regions of effector genes is statistically significant . also, a perfect match to the extended motif  is present in the upstream regions of three genes encoding enzymes that we found in our analysis of the xylem sap proteome: foxg_ <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  encoding a glycosyl hydrolase and the closely related foxg_ <dig> on the pathogenicity chromosome and foxg_ <dig> on an unpositioned scaffold, encoding a peroxidase-catalases. nevertheless, the function of this putative regulatory sequence remains to be established.

interestingly, six <dig> as well as six <dig> and six <dig> were weakly expressed in all promoter deletion strains in vitro, but not in planta. in absence of a plant host, six gene expression is usually very low  <cit> , while it is strongly induced upon plant infection  <cit> . six genes are only needed during plant infection; therefore the fungus might actively suppress six gene expression in the absence of a plant host. one way of suppressing gene expression is by modification of chromatin to a repressive, closed state. repressive chromatin structures often involve histone modifications such as h3k <dig> methylation  <cit> . one origin of such repressive chromatin structures is te silencing, often guided by small rnas transcribed from the te  <cit> . in plants of the solanaceae family, mites proximal to r gene loci were shown to produce small rnas that are recruiting the histone methylation machinery for te silencing resulting in the formation of closed chromatin  <cit> . te silencing of the mites surrounding the six genes might likewise create a repressive chromatin environment, which may serve as a first layer of six gene regulation. upon stress, such as during plant infection, tes might be derepressed as shown for the oomycete pathogen phythophthora ramorum <cit> , thus creating an open chromatin structure. binding of transcriptional activators or repressors would be possible in an open chromatin state and provide the basis for a second layer of regulation of six gene expression.

identification of novel effector candidates
we identified eight novel  effector genes based on the presence of a mimp in their promoters and/or the presence of their protein product in xylem sap of infected plants. five of these genes  were identified by the in silico search and validated by the analysis of xylem sap from infected tomato plants. like the previously identified six <dig> and six <dig> genes, six <dig> escaped the in silico identification due to a sequencing gap close to its promoter. six <dig> encodes an unusual effector lacking a recognizable n-terminal signal peptide for secretion via the classic endoplasmatic-reticulum/golgi route. nevertheless, the six <dig> protein is present in the xylem sap of infected tomato plants and therefore might be secreted via an unconventional protein secretion route  <cit> . six <dig> encodes the only effector known so far that is located on a ls chromosome other than the pathogenicity chromosome. we also identified foave <dig> as a gene harboring a mimp in its promoter, but we did not detect the foave <dig> protein in the xylem sap nor detected foave <dig> mrna in infected plants . apparently, in the strains used here foave <dig> is not expressed during infection, although it was shown to be able to elicit ve1-mediated resistance in a heterologous system  <cit> . foave <dig> might be part of a silent effector reservoir together with the other three genes that encode small, secreted proteins and harbor a mimp in their promoters, but are not expressed during infection.

some of the genes we identified here have been subject to gene or segmental duplications. orx <dig> is present in two similar but not identical copies on the pathogenicity chromosome . two other genes, foxg_ <dig> on the pathogenicity chromosome and foxg_ <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  both encode a metalloprotease. apart from a missing 3’ end of foxg_ <dig> due to a sequencing gap, the two genes and their promoters are identical, indicating a recent duplication event. six <dig> is also duplicated. in both cases the duplicated gene copies do not harbor a mimp in their promoter. six8b is present in four identical copies due to an intra- and interchromosomal segmental duplication within and between chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . this duplicated chromosomal segment corresponds to another small chromosome that can be transferred horizontally from the strain fol <dig> <cit> . progeny strains possessing both the pathogenicity chromosome and the other small chromosome are more aggressive towards tomato than progeny strains with only the pathogenicity chromosome. at present, we do not know which gene on the small chromosome  contributes to pathogenicity towards tomato – six8b was not found in the xylem sap proteome.

in summary, mimps are associated with the promoters of all small in planta secreted proteins, as well as several enzymes. our strategy for in silico detection of effector genes in f. oxysporum is limited by three factors: 1) imperfect conservation of the irs of a mimp, 2) sequencing gaps in the genome assembly and 3) absence of a canonical n-terminal signal peptide for secretion. the impact of first two factors may be alleviated by more advanced methods for mimp detection and genome assembly. the third factor, absence of a canonical signal peptide, can be either due to secretion via an unconventional route or to a failure of signalp to predict a signal peptide, as was the case for six <dig> or six <dig>  in the latter case, incorporation of gene structure  predictions or transcript sequences will be helpful. overall, our approach presents a powerful tool to predict novel effectors and other virulence factors in f. oxysporum.

CONCLUSIONS
class ii tes are much less evenly distributed over the fol pathogenicity chromosome than class i tes. effector genes reside as single genes or mini-gene clusters within class ii te-enriched chromosomal subregions. two mites are closely associated with effector genes. a  mimp is always present in effector gene promoter regions and a mfot <dig> is frequently present downstream of the effector gene mini-clusters. we could exclude a direct involvement of the mimp in effector gene expression by making promoter deletion strains for two effector gene loci followed by gene expression analysis and tomato pathogenicity assays. overall, the unique association of effector genes and mimps allowed us to develop a method to successfully predict candidate effector genes. for most of these genes, the corresponding protein was found by mass spectrometry in the xylem sap of tomato during fol infection. our method can easily be extended to predict novel effector genes in fo strains with different host specificities.
