BACKGROUND
the investigation of gene regulation in general, and transcription factor binding in particular, is a challenging task  <cit> , and many data sources should be considered. in silico predictions based on position specific scoring matrices  suffer from many matches. these matches may be false positives, since they only rely on the primary structure of a sequence. for instance, the spatial structure and accessibility of dna, which is not only defined by its sequence, is important when considering transcription factor binding. hence, predictions made using only the primary structure of a sequence are usually not presumed to be very specific.

one may expect that similarity between a base sequence and a known binding motif is a necessary condition for binding, but it is neither a necessary, nor a sufficient one. on one hand, transcription factors can bind sequences that are quite dissimilar from their known binding motif. on the other hand, other effects  can prevent the transcription factor from binding, even if the binding motif is matching. nevertheless, to arrive at a binary binding/non-binding statement, predictions with a sequence-based similarity score below an arbitrary threshold are usually discarded. a binary decision is of course problematic, since binding and functionality are both better reflected by a gradual scale. in vitro analyses may likewise not be reliable. that is, even if transcription factor binding is measured, this may be an experimental artifact and does not necessarily imply regulatory effects. no method or algorithm based on sequence data alone can predict regulatory function of individual transcription factor binding sites, even if binding has been demonstrated in vivo.

to make the best of this situation, we and others proposed to integrate data from different sources  <cit> . apart from computational predictions, curated data and gene expression experiments can be considered; some are available from genome browsers such as the ucsc browser  <cit> . however, such data is usually not available. then again, conservation data on the sequence level is very often available, and conservation of transcriptional modules  <cit>  can help to improve hypotheses about transcriptional regulation. based on this premise, using the conservation of binding sites between species, we developed a tool called rexspecies  <cit>  for the identification of transcriptional modules, and of their gain/loss patterns in evolution.

in the following, a transcriptional module is defined as a set of transcription factor binding sites, and a gain/loss pattern is defined as a transcriptional module, for which we find a gain or loss in evolution, see implementation. please note that the term transcriptional module as defined here is closely related to the term regulatory module. in turn, the term regulatory module has three distinct definitions in the literature. a regulatory module is defined either  as a sequence region that contains regulatory functions with no particular reference to transcription factor binding sites, or  as a particular transcription factor binding site combination that has one defined transcriptional function, or  as a sequence region that contains regulatory functions, including transcription factor binding site combinations that may separately or simultaneously have one or more transcriptional functions. rexspecies aims to find regulatory modules in the sense of definition . it highlights regions in sequences as potentially functional and proposes transcriptional modules, i.e. sets of transcription factor binding sites providing one or more of such functions.

here, we present version  <dig>  of rexspecies, which offers an array of new features, and has been improved in terms of graphical visualization, interactivity, and usability. it provides full automation; the only input needed is a gene name, or the coordinates of a promoter region. in case of a gene name, a genomic region upstream of the transcription start site is taken, based on ucsc  <cit>  data. starting from a precomputed selection of homologous regulatory regions available via ucsc  <cit> , rexspecies  <dig> automatically searches for transcription factor binding sites therein, using position specific scoring matrices and the possum tool  <cit> . further, it generates novel hypotheses about modules and the gain/loss patterns associated with these. such groups of predicted transcription factor binding sites are relevant for the study of gene regulation; their evolutionary conservation and history can now be visualized by means of the following figures:

 <dig>  an annotated alignment, combining sequence and binding site information,

 <dig>  an annotated phylogenetic tree, including ancestral states estimated for the transcription factor binding sites found in today's species,

 <dig>  a combination of alignment and tree,

 <dig>  interactive web pages of 1- <dig> 

 <dig>  interactive genome browser web pages . in particular, rexspecies  <dig>  can now write bed file format  <cit>  that can be visualized using the ucsc genome browser  <cit>  and the ensembl genome browser  <cit> .

interpretation of predicted transcription factor binding sites - lots of false positives or lots of ubiquitous transcription?
as methods for the investigation of gene regulation neglect some aspects of binding and frequently generate a large amount of predictions, a high false positive rate is usually assumed. however, an alternative to declaring that most predicted transcription factor binding sites are false positives is motivated by the concept of "ubiquitous transcription"  <cit> . in general, ubiquitous transcription refers to the observation that virtually every nucleotide is transcribed  <cit> , even though often at low levels, and usually with negligible biological effect. the biological effect may in turn depend on the biological context. ubiquitous transcription can be explained by a utilization of binding sites by transcription factors that is much higher than usually estimated. such binding would be highly context-dependent; in particular it may depend on transcription factor abundance, and on epigenetic influences that modify dna accessibility. if the regulatory regions of specific genes are studied, as will be the case here, high utilization of binding sites means that many predicted binding sites and corresponding modules are functional, even though many of them are only functional in specific, often negligible contexts.

in this paper, we cannot and do not need to prove or disprove ubiquitous transcription. however, the actual amount of ubiquitous transcription has implications for the interpretation of the results we find. the more ubiquitous transcription there is, the more likely the predicted binding sites and corresponding modules are functional, and the closer the findings we report below are a true reflection of reality. in the remainder of this paper, our interpretation will be on the conservative side, and we will write about the "large amount of false positives" in the usual fashion. in the extreme case, almost every predicted binding site may be considered "false positive". we suggest, however, that binding sites found by rexspecies, which are included in an evolutionarily conserved module and which are gained or lost together, have a good chance of being "true positive". in the results and discussion section, we wish to demonstrate that there is some evidence for our suggestion provided by the plausibility of many of the modules that we detect.

other approaches to filter transcription factor binding sites using evolutionary conservation
as discussed, we assume that there are many putatively false positive predicted transcription factor binding sites found as matches of position specific scoring matrices in eukaryotic genomes . in our case, predictions will be filtered by taking binding sites forming a module that is conserved in evolutionary time. a critical point for filtering by evolutionary conservation is to identify homology. such homology should not just hold for the base sequence. instead, evolutionary constraints also apply to binding effects, which depend on the spatial structure and accessibility of the dna and on binding affinities  of transcription factor molecules to the dna, which classical alignments based on sequence  fail to consider. moreover, functional equivalence of different sub-sequences may be retained although the sequence itself changes heavily.

to overcome some of these difficulties, two approaches are possible in principle. one way is to first search for transcription factor binding sites, and to afterwards identify homology . the other way is to start with finding homologous sequences and their alignment, and then to search for transcription factor binding sites therein . in each case, the first step is crucial.

• finding transcription factor binding sites first  means that it is not possible to use evolutionary conservation for that step, and a decline in specificity may be the result.

• if analyses start generating an alignment , the result, i.e. statements about homology on the sequence level, given by the alignment, may be of low quality. during the alignment step, no knowledge about the putative transcription factor binding sites found in the sequences can then be used, so their possible homology cannot be taken into account. for example, some binding sites may inadvertantly be torn apart by the alignment in one of the sequences, because they are not considered during the alignment step.

one alignment-free method is the regulatory region score  proposed by koohy et al.  <cit> . it combines gene expression related features with sequence features and then calculates average scores for sequences to be bound by certain transcription factors. it afterwards generates a list of functionally homologous sequences.

unlike the rrs method, rexspecies  <dig>  belongs to the phylogenetic footprinting methods, generating an alignment first. it does not generate de-novo transcription factor binding site motifs, but instead it uses libraries of known binding site motifs, and it subsequently generates de-novo modules of transcription factor binding sites. manke et al.  <cit>  published such a method that finds transcription factor binding site modules in conserved regulatory sequences. it is based on gene expression data and gene function  data and their algorithm does not directly consider a phylogeny, but evolutionary conservation is used. similarly, mcast  <cit>  allows one to search for clusters of motif matches, but without using phylogenic information. gibbsmodule  <cit>  and phyme  <cit>  provide de-novo detection of motifs and transcriptional modules constituted by such motifs. compared to these two tools, rexspecies  <dig>  uses validated libraries of position specific scoring matrices  <cit>  for finding transcription factor binding sites and searches for sets of potentially cooperating transcription factor binding sites, using their phylogenetic conservation.

other important frameworks used to analyze transcriptional regulation are genomatix  <cit>  with its frameworker module, transfac  <cit>  and mapper  <cit> . except for mapper, these tools are only commercially available. mapper and transfac do not search for modules, but for transcription factor binding sites only. one feature of mapper is that it provides a user interface to meme  <cit> , a tool to generate de novo transcription factor binding site models. genomatix frameworker does not reconstruct ancestral states, but searches in a set of sequences for common patterns to detect modules.

many of the approaches listed above only generate lists of putative modules but lack the ability to render sophisticated figures. when these approaches generate figures  or interact with genome browsers , they only show aligned sequences where glyphs  below these sequences represent the predictions. they fail to show the evolutionary history of single transcription factor binding sites or crms. rexspecies  <dig>  provides some novel figure types  that were designed to analyze transcriptional regulation, including its evolution.

RESULTS
input for rexspecies  <dig> 
once logged in to the rexspecies web-server to start a new analysis, only genome coordinates  or a gene name have to be entered. additionally, the set of position specific scoring matrices to use  may be changed and the parameters for the different stages/steps  of the analysis may be adjusted.

workflow of rexspecies  <dig> 
after starting an analysis, rexspecies  <dig>  first supplements the data with a set of regulatory regions from other species homologous to the selected one. this is done using the multiz track of the ucsc genome database  <cit> . in the next step , sequence based predictions for transcription factor binding sites are generated by possum  <cit> , in particular based on the jaspar position specific scoring matrix database  <cit> . in the following two steps , these predictions are aligned and annotated, such that redundant matches are clustered and homologous predictions are detected. this generates a table of predictions for each species. then, in the 5th step , the nodes of the phylogenetic species tree for the species under investigation  <cit>   are labelled using the table of predictions and fitch parsimony  <cit>  reconstruction for the ancestral states. the edges of this tree are then, in the 6th step, annotated with all gains and losses of transcription factor binding sites based on the node annotations generated in the step before. finally, in the set of predicted gains and losses, rexspecies  <dig>  searches for gain/loss patterns of modules and generates the output files as described next.

output files generated by rexspecies  <dig> 
rexspecies  <dig>  generates different files, especially figures that allow users to visualize regulatory sequences and that highlight evolutionary conserved modules. all figures can be exported in pdf format. depending on a file's content , it can also be exported in different spreadsheet formats , or in common graphic formats . additionally, rexspecies can write bed files  <cit> . such bed files  are input files for genome browsers such as ucsc  <cit>  or ensembl  <cit> . the genome browser can then be used to generate figures of the transcription factor binding site predictions made by rexspecies, with extended annotations available via the user interface of the genome browser as clickable links.  rexspecies  <dig>  can also generate figures that show an annotated alignment with color-coded species, giving an overview of the annotated sequences . another type of output file is a table  that lists all modules with gain/loss patterns . all output files are systematically presented in additional file  <dig>  part ii.

bed files, and ucsc visualization
using ucsc  <cit>  and ensembl  <cit> , custom annotation tracks may be uploaded in bed  format  <cit> . therefore, we implemented export of results generated by rexspecies  <dig>  as bed files  <cit> . these files can be uploaded to the ucsc genome browser and to ensembl. ucsc can also directly be opened from rexspecies  <dig>  with the bed file already uploaded, enabling scientists to analyze rexspecies  <dig>  predictions in a familiar manner together with other features as proposed in  <cit> .  above a given threshold. given a phylogenetic species tree annotated with binding site predictions, the branch length score corresponds to the summation of all branch lengths  of the subtree, in which for all leaves the prediction is annotated. thus, the bed files contain either transcription factor binding sites as parts of modules, or highly conserved transcription factor binding sites filtered and ranked by their individual branch length score.

annotated alignment 
in genome browsers, figures are generated in a sequence-centered way and annotations are usually plotted below the sequence. a complementary sequence-centered figure is generated by rexspecies since  <dig>  visualizing the transcription factor binding sites species-by-species . this figure is called alignment-based figure. examples are provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, because we usually consider homologous sequences from many species, which often contain many predictions, we will generate very large images if we consider all species in the alignment separately. to consider all species simultaneously, rexspecies  clusters homologous predictions, and the size of the figure can thus be reduced to fewer glyphs  by eliminating redundant ones. only one glyph is then used for each transcription factor binding site prediction, instead of many different ones for each prediction in each species. to generate such figures, we implemented a homology-based rendering in rexspecies  <dig>  where each prediction is shown only once, as in figure  <dig>  for each transcription factor binding site prediction, all species in which homologous transcription factor binding sites occur are color coded. in figure  <dig>  the species tree is plotted to the left of the predictions and its nodes are colored the same way as the predictions are.

we developed a color assignment algorithm that assigns similar colors to closely related species and different colors to distant species. this algorithm implements the following principles:

• the color hue of the nodes follows a gradient along the leaves of the tree, so that evolutionary distant nodes are assigned dissimilar colors while evolutionary close nodes are similarly colored.

• nodes close to the root get darker colors than nodes close to the leaves.

homology-based figures emphasize highly conserved predictions in a natural way since they are rendered in many colors, because they are present in many species.  also, it is easy to find predictions that are present in two distant regions of the species tree, because for each region, a block of similar colors is shown. such predictions present in two distant regions often form a gain/loss pattern.

as in all types of figure , gain/loss patterns can be highlighted using the pattern color option. if activated, colors are assigned to patterns, and the pattern colors are shown in the left half of each prediction box in the alignment, while node--colors of the transcription factor binding site prediction  are plotted to the right of the pattern colors. the nodes are then split in half, where the left half shows the pattern colors, and the right half shows the node  colors. examples for homology-based figures are figure  <dig> and additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

legend of the homology based figure
in figure  <dig>  the pattern and the transcription factor binding sites found in the murine cr <dig> region are visualized species by species. the leaves of the species tree consist of colored boxes that are split into a left and a right half. on the left, all patterns that are predicted to be gained at this node by parsimony are indicated by color ; on the right, another color indicates the species corresponding to the node. in case of cr <dig>  only one pattern is found, and it is gained at the root; hence we see only the dark pink color for this one pattern at the root. as explained above, species are indicated using another color scheme, going from green  to brown . a plus "+" sign next to the box denotes that a node gains transcription factor binding sites predicted by parsimony. between the box just discussed, and the label with the species name, another box  indicates those patterns, whose transcription factor binding sites all are predicted to exist for the species in question. in case of cr <dig>  only one pattern is found, hence we see only the dark pink boxes for this one pattern. on top, alignment coordinates and genome coordinates of the reference genome  are shown. the transcription factor binding sites  are labelled using their cluster name that contains the name of the transcription factor, the strand , the  position in alignment coordinates and the length of the transcription factor binding site in base pairs , if identical for all clustered transcription factor binding sites and homologs. the transcription factor binding sites have colored overlays that represent the species where homologs of that transcription factor binding site are predicted. the thicker part of these overlays  indicates the patterns , for which the transcription factor binding site is predicted by parsimony. the thin part indicates extant species , for which the transcription factor binding site is predicted using position specific scoring matrices and clustering. in the legend below the figure, all leaf/species and all pattern colors are explained. to keep the figures readable, by default, only the first  <dig> patterns  are shown in the homology-based figures.

table with all details about patterns
the most extensive output is the full list of gain/loss patterns of transcriptional modules. each pattern is shown with its branch length score, the nodes in the tree where the gain/loss occurred, its transcription factor binding sites, and two logos:

• the pattern logo  shows the pattern as it would occur in the alignment-based figure. that is, it shows a small alignment-based zoom-in where only the transcription factor binding sites consisting of the pattern are drawn.

• the tree logo  shows the species tree. in this tree, the ancestral inner gain/loss nodes of the pattern as found by parsimony  are highlighted in the pattern color. furthermore, all leaves of extant species, where the full pattern is present, are drawn in that color. the treelogo is strongly related to the branch length score. more specifically, the branch length score increases when there are more highlighted leaves and when the evolutionary distance separating the leaves is greater.

the pattern table can also be downloaded in excel  <cit>  or openoffice calc opendocument format  <cit> , as a pdf or as an xml file, which could be processed further, using xsl transformation  <cit> .

a long version of the pattern table includes sequence logos  <cit>  for each sequence motif that is part of the pattern. furthermore, direct links to different databases are provided, linking to

• the ncbi entrezgene  <cit>  entries for the genes that code for the transcription factors,

• the string  <cit>  network of all transcription factors and the target gene of the regulatory sequence,

• a google search for the transcription factors of the pattern and the target gene of the regulatory sequence,

• ihop  <cit>  searches for the transcription factor names, especially for those that are not mapped to any gene identifier.

each match can easily be found in the figures generated by rexspecies  using a javascript function that highlights the corresponding elements, using the rexspecies web site. pattern tables can be found in the supplement as additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

insights into the regulation of two of the core genes of pluripotency, pou5f <dig> and sox2
in the following, we will exemplify the use of rexspecies  <dig>  by four case studies. we used position specific scoring matrices from two databases  <cit>  to analyze the so-called "most conserved elements"  of known regulatory sequences of pluripotency related genes. for the following case studies, we have chosen the cr <dig>  and the cr <dig> of the murine pou5f <dig> gene  <cit> . the cr <dig> is found at chr17: <dig> ,919- <dig> , <dig>  and cr <dig> at chr17: <dig> ,642- <dig> , <dig> in version  <dig> of the mouse genome. further, we analyzed the n <dig> and srr <dig>  <cit>  regions of the murine sox <dig> gene. the n <dig> region is found at chr3: <dig> ,105- <dig> , <dig> and the srr <dig> region at chr3: <dig> ,031- <dig> ,378; it is part of the n <dig> region  <cit> . rexspecies  <dig>  was used to remove duplicate matches, to find putative homologous matches, and to remove implausible matches such as plant specific transcription factor binding sites in mammals. further, it was used to generate figures to visualize transcription factor binding in an evolutionary context and to highlight interesting evolutionary patterns.

here, we present rexspecies  <dig> figures for all above mentioned regions and formulate hypotheses about their biological function. we will discuss these hypotheses in the context of what is known about these regions. therefore, table  <dig> includes all transcription factors listed in  <cit>  that are known to bind to the regions investigated here, indicating which of these are available to rexspecies  <dig>  based on the jaspar/transfac  <cit>  libraries it uses. table  <dig> is only used to discuss rexspecies results; there is no initial expert-guided restriction on the transcription factor binding sites considered by rexspecies.

transcription factor binding sites from  <cit>  and their availability in jaspar  <cit>  or transfac  <cit>   as of  <dig>  "-" indicates that a position specific scoring matrix is not available, "+" indicates that it is. instead of rare, retinoic receptor rara and rar-gamma are available.

one should keep in mind that our hypotheses require experimental validation; some experiments will be reported in the next section. following the hypothesis of "ubiquitous transcription" , we suggest that many of the following interpretations do have a small, but often negligible, probability to hold true in a specific biological context. nevertheless, one or more interpretations may emerge as important new links in the transcriptional regulatory network, if more experiments are done. patterns are ordered by branch length score  <cit> . the numbering of patterns in the ucsc tracks of some figures is not always consecutive; while patterns found only in species other than mouse are included in the rexspecies  <dig>  pattern list for the respective regulatory region, they are not included in a figure using mouse as the reference genome.

interpretation  <dig>  the cr <dig> region 
the cr <dig> region is of interest because there are no known binding sites .

the only module found by rexspecies  <dig>  in the cr <dig> region  includes smad  and klf4/stat , matching the module proposed in tomlinson & chambers   <cit> , figure six therein. the smad3-klf <dig> cooperation was also demonstrated by hu et al,  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, we were able to demonstrate that both smad and klf <dig> binding have a regulatory impact on the cr <dig> region, see the next section.

interpretation  <dig>  the cr <dig> region 
sorting the patterns found for cr <dig> by branch length score, the first six patterns with exception of the forth are describing "small modules". the binding sites they include are often also included in the "large modules" # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig> and # <dig> 

pattern # <dig>  is composed of ets <dig> and etf . notably, it is long known that ets <dig> activity is enhanced by tef- <dig> , leading to activity of ctalpha. ctalpha in turn regulates phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, which is implied in mouse embryonic development  <cit> , and its possible co-regulation with pou5f <dig> may be reflected by this module.

pattern # <dig>  may relate to vitamin d receptor  expression, which plays a role in growth and differentiation. it consists of wt <dig> and zeb <dig> binding sites, both of which up-regulate the activity of the vdr promoter   <cit> . thus, vdr activation may go hand in hand with oct4/pou5f <dig> repression by way of this module. moreover, zeb <dig> is an emt inducer  <cit> , and wt <dig> is required for emt in embryonic stem cells , providing another possible connection to repression of pluripotency and pou5f <dig> 

pattern # <dig>  etf  and brca <dig>  in euteleostomi  are both linked to proliferation, just by their names. however, investigating the literature and databases  no other connection between these two putative stimulators of pou5f <dig> could be found.

pattern # <dig> features some of the earlier discussed transcription factors, as well further transcription factors that are known to be involved in pluripotency and differentiation . notably, the sp <dig> site  matches a literature-curated site , thus this is already experimentally validated.

pattern # <dig> is found in all boreotheria. the transcription factor acaat shows similarity to the binding motif of the sox <dig> protein . unfortunately, no position specific scoring matrix for sox <dig> is available in jaspar nor in transfac. sox <dig> was proposed to play a role in differentiation of male germ cells  <cit> . gata was discussed to play a potential role in germ cells  <cit> . it is possible that both differentiation-related transcription factors are involved in pou5f <dig> regulation, suppressing its expression in the course of germ cell differentiation.

pattern # <dig> in boreotheria includes transcription factors that are implied in the development of the pancreas, cd44+ cells and photoreceptor cells. if it is functional, it may simply be inhibitory. this pattern also contains pax and gata <dig>  which may work together in regulation of kidney development  <cit> . pattern # <dig> is like pattern # <dig> quite large. even though it is predicted for the boreotheria by parsimony, only parts of it are available for many of the boreotheria including mouse and human. it contains many factors that are relevant for the control of pluripotency, such as coup , stat, gata, and esrrb, but no clear interpretation is possible.

pattern # <dig>  overlaps with the literature-curated known binding site lrh- <dig> . at the "far left" , it includes ets <dig> and tef1; this part is not found in mouse . since it is not found in some other species either, it triggers a disharmonic treelogo . lrh- <dig> may cooperate with some other transcription factors in the pattern, which are implicated into pluripotency, such as klf <dig> and p <dig>  pattern # <dig> in murinae yields an interesting hypothesis of the mouse- specific cooperation of the pluripotency-related transcription factor binding sites zic2/ <dig>  mycn, coup-tf <dig> , and yy <dig> 

interpretation  <dig>  the n2/srr <dig> region 
part of the srr <dig> region was already analyzed by rexspecies  <dig>  in  <cit>  . in that analysis, we zoomed into the small subsection of srr <dig> that includes the stat <dig> and oct4/brn1/ <dig> binding sites experimentally validated in mouse: this subsection is conserved up to fish. we found patterns including the stat <dig> and oct4/brn1/ <dig> binding sites, and two further patterns that combine predicted binding sites of transcription factors of dual  relevance, possibly reflecting the known dual role of the n2/srr <dig> region  <cit> . in figure  <dig>  we show the patterns that we observe if we zoom out and analyze the entire srr <dig> region. in particular, pattern # <dig> includes matches to the experimentally validated oct4/brn1/ <dig> binding sites, designated brn <dig> and octx . in the earlier zoom-in analysis, the first oct4/brn1/ <dig> binding site was out-of-scope and could not be found; this first site is now found, in pattern # <dig>  together with the second validated oct4/brn1/ <dig> binding site, and it co-localizes with sox-related binding  as well as stat-related binding . pattern # <dig> includes, besides others, nobox and pdx <dig> binding sites on the left that are missing in mouse . therefore, not the entire pattern is found in mouse/rat. however, it is estimated by parsimony to be gained first in tetrapods.

the first two tracks  are surprising; pu. <dig> and gata <dig> are known as antagonistic regulators of hematopoiesis  <cit>  and no connection with pluripotency or  neural development has been described so far. thus, either  <dig>  the patterns are false positives, or they contribute to ubiquitous transcription ; or  <dig>  pu. <dig> and gata <dig> are involved in pluripotency or early neural development, that is they are "moonlighting" in addition to their well-known role; or  <dig>  the region under investigation is involved in hematopoiesis ; or  <dig>  pu. <dig> and gata <dig> could fulfill a repressive function on the sox <dig> locus, to ensure that there is no ectodermal pattern being expressed in the hematopoietic cells.

there is a hint of evidence for scenario , since the sox <dig> n <dig> region regulates the anterior neural plate  <cit>  and rekhtman et al  <cit>  report that after injection of pu. <dig> rna, xenopus "embryos also displayed defects unrelated to hematopoiesis in the developing dorsal axis, seen first as an uneven neural plate  and resulting in abnormally shaped tails." it should be noted that although the pu. <dig> pattern  is inferred to be amniotic , it also appears in some fish , where it must have been gained independently, according to parsimony. then again, it is more likely that it was gained once in euteleostomi, but lost in zebrafish and frog.

in the next two tracks, patterns # <dig> and # <dig> are displayed. they both feature stat <dig>  which is slightly upstream of the validated stat <dig> binding site. they also feature movo-b/ovol <dig>  which is required for embryonic development, in particular of the cranial neural tube  <cit> . finally, the last two patterns occur in very few species, reflected by their low branch length score. if they are not false positive, they are likely a "negligible" part of ubiquitous transcription.

interpretation  <dig>  the n <dig> region 
the n <dig> region regulates the anterior neural plate  <cit> ; it features few binding sites that were experimentally validated in mouse . however, transfac-based computational analyses cannot find fgf binding sites, because there is no model . as reported by  <cit>  , the first lef <dig> binding site is found in all tetrapods that were investigated, whereas the second lef <dig> binding site was lost  in xenopus frog. in line with this observation, we infer that patterns with the second site were gained in amniotes , whereas patterns with the first site are inferred to be gained in tetrapods . all these patterns include a variety of other predicted binding sites, with no clear overrepresentation of specific groups of transcription factors. apart from the group of patterns that include lef <dig>  a second group of patterns is worth to be discussed . these patterns include oct and/or sox motifs . in particular, the oct/sox  motif of pattern # <dig> may indicate an involvement of n <dig> not just in neural development, but also in pluripotency.

experimental validation
in order to evaluate the benefits of rexspecies  <dig>  transactivation of three transcription factors to the conserved regions of the pou5f <dig> regulatory region  <cit>  was investigated by luciferase assays . lif  was used to trigger the stat-pathway and resulted in a significant transcriptional decrease in cr <dig>  while it showed no effect on cr <dig> in comparison to the negative control. the straightforward interpretation is that only the cr <dig> region has a functional stat binding site in the context of our experimental setup. this functional binding site may match the one predicted to be part of pattern # <dig>  activin a was used to activate the smad-pathway, facilitating smad <dig> binding to its downstream target genes. the activation of smad <dig> showed a modest but reproducible increase of the luciferase activity on cr <dig> while it shows no regulatory effect on the cr <dig>  this matches the rexspecies 2-based results for these two conserved regions that we presented above; no smad binding is predicted for the cr <dig> region, in contrast to the cr <dig> region. klf <dig> overexpression led to a transcriptional repression in the conserved regions  <dig> and  <dig> in our assay; klf <dig> was predicted to bind to both conserved regions.

since it was shown that klf <dig> partners with the histone acetyltransferase p <dig>  and the luciferase system lacks the epigenetic landscape of the endogenous regulatory elements, the transcriptional repression may not represent the full picture of klf <dig> function on the regulatory region of the pou5f <dig> gene. however, the observed effects on the transactivation activity clearly indicate that stat binds to the cr <dig>  smad <dig> binds to the cr <dig>  and klf <dig> binds to the cr <dig> and cr <dig> regions. these experimental data validate in part the predicted modules and highlight the value of the rexspecies  <dig> filters for experimental researchers.

CONCLUSIONS
exploration of regulatory sequences made easier
the examples show that there are usually large amounts of filtered data returned by rexspecies  <dig> , which must still be vetted by an expert. this is not necessarily the fault of rexspecies, but it is due to the fact that only sequence information, but no gene expression data, etc., which is not usually available, is used as input. moreover, as discussed in the next section, the large amount of filtered data returned by rexspecies  <dig>  may reflect reality at least to some degree. nevertheless, we believe that scientists benefit from its first-line filtering, and they moreover can benefit from our visualization and from the interactive tools we provide. the incorporation of evolutionary considerations can help identify true positive transcription factor binding site predictions. the putative evolution of  transcription factor binding sites is thus displayed, going beyond common visualization approaches such as genome browsers. rexspecies  <dig>  helps to explore the large amount of predictions returned by matching classic position specific scoring matrices. it automates many steps from downloading the data to running position specific scoring matrix software, and it aligns sequences and predictions in order to find conserved patterns in the output data. it then converts the results into useful formats .

furthermore, it interfaces with genome browsers to analyze the conserved patterns in other contexts. thus, integrative and comparative studies with known tracks at ucsc and other genome browsers are made easy and supplementing results of such regulation studies with other published work is facilitated. scientists can therefore find relevant transcription factor binding site predictions for their work.

ubiquitous transcription and the interpretation of rexspecies
