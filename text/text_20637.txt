BACKGROUND
similarly to the development of other organs, tooth morphogenesis is a complex multifactorial process involving fundamental morphogenetic mechanisms , which are controlled by interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme.

mouse adult dentition comprises one incisor, which is separated from three molars by a toothless diastema in each jaw quadrant. although adult mouse diastema does not contain teeth, there are tooth rudiments transiently apparent in the upper and lower embryonic diastema  <cit> . in mouse embryonic lower diastema two large rudimentary tooth buds  appear during embryonic development  <cit>  and they have been associated with premolar teeth lost during evolution  <cit> . the larger posterior rudiment  is incorporated into the rising cap of the functional first molar   <cit> .

enamel knots  are transient signaling centers comprising non-dividing cell population in dental epithelium  <cit> . eks are important structures initiating and regulating tooth shape and determining the number of tooth cusps  <cit> . they were considered to be the main regulator of tooth development  <cit> . it has been discovered that the primary enamel knot  controls morphogenesis in the first molar germ in mouse  <cit>  and that sonic hedgehog  is expressed there  <cit> . during early stages of odontogenesis, shh expression is limited to the epithelial cells and it is considered as an early marker of odontogenesis  <cit> . the shh stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells in areas of early tooth development  <cit> . moreover, shh is also expressed in the signaling centers of the ms and r <dig> rudiments  <cit> . in the present study, we showed that m <dig> pek in its accepted meaning  arises as late as after the fusion of the original r <dig> and early m <dig> shh signaling domains.

a supernumerary tooth in front of molars was found in adult spry <dig> or spry <dig> knock out mice  <cit> . the premolar rudiments ms and r <dig> have been assumed to take a part in the formation of supernumerary tooth in front of m <dig>  <cit> .

gene dosage is an issue that is far from being explored. research is carried out in particular at the level of chromosomes mainly dealing with chromosomal or segmental aneuploidy . transgenic mice enable to study the dose of one or two selected genes. using wise-null mice, it has been proven that phenotypes of tooth  number depends on varying doses of the lrp <dig> and lrp <dig> co-receptor genes  <cit> . similarly, it has been proven that doses of the fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> genes affect formation of diastemal tooth in sprouty <dig> deficient mice  <cit> . using sprouty2;sprouty <dig>  transgenic mice, it has been found that number of incisors may be influenced by the level of activity of a single signal transduction pathway  <cit> .

however, the information about relationship of spry <dig> and spry <dig> gene dosages and early tooth development in the cheek region is missing. we presented here that a lack of sprouty <dig> and sprouty <dig> alleles influences the dynamics of the shh expression in the lower jaw of spry2;spry <dig> mutant mice, as well as the development of the r <dig> rudiment and the m <dig>  this influence increased with the decreased number of functional sprouty alleles. we proved that with decreased dosages of sprouty genes, the signaling center of r <dig> rudiment did not participate in the m <dig> formation and it stayed separate becoming a signaling center of the supernumerary tooth primordium in front of m <dig> anlage.

RESULTS
dynamics of shh expression influenced by sprouty gene dosages
for all nine possible genotypes , the shape of dental epithelium and a presence and pattern of shh expression domains were evaluated during the tooth development in the lower jaw from e <dig>  till  <dig>  . the sequential occurrence of the shh expression was determined in the rudiment ms, rudiment r <dig> and m <dig> anlage in mutants and compared to controls .table  <dig>

lower number of spry2−/−;spry4−/− mutant embryos compared to other genotypes could be caused by their early prenatal lethality that might be related to a high incidence of additional developmental defects  <cit> .



higher spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages
a group with higher spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages comprised the control genotype  and the genotypes with one mutant allele of one or both spry <dig> and/or spry <dig> genes . the samples showed similarities in shh expression dynamics and in shape  of dental epithelia during development.figure  <dig> physiological and pathological tooth formation in dissociated epithelia of mouse lower cheek region.  in samples with higher spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages , r <dig> shh signaling domain  merges with early m <dig> shh signaling domain  to form a typical elongated pek  of the germ of m <dig>   in samples with lower spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages , r <dig> signaling domain  persists in front of m <dig> signaling domain  and became a signaling center of supernumerary tooth primordium . anterior direction is on the left side .



the first shh expression domain localized in ms rudiment was detected from e <dig>  until  <dig>  . it was followed by r <dig> signaling domain from e <dig>  until  <dig>  . in two genotypes of this group  we noticed synchronous presence of two separate signaling centers corresponding to ms and r <dig> at e <dig>  , but only for a short time and both signaling domains were very weak. from e <dig>  until  <dig>   the dissociated epithelia showed two isolated shh expression domains in r <dig> and m <dig> primordia. between e <dig>  and  <dig>   the fusion of these two  domains was obvious . after that, only one single shh domain persisted corresponding to the pek of m <dig> from e <dig>  until  <dig>  . all the above-mentioned chronological parameters were summarized for the four genotypes with higher dosages of spry <dig> and spry <dig> genes . interestingly, the development in general was slightly delayed compared to control mice  in all transgenic specimens .figure  <dig> 
shh expression in three distinct signaling domains  in spry2;spry <dig> samples. shh expression in three distinct signaling domains: ms , r <dig>  and m <dig> , was sequentially detected in the cheek region of embryonic mandibles in nine various spry2;spry <dig> mouse genotypes according to embryonic body weights.  the supernumerary tooth formation is dependent on decreasing dosages of spry <dig> and spry <dig> genes. the samples with higher spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages showed merging  of r <dig> and early m <dig> shh signaling domains into one expression domain  located in the center of m <dig> germ. in contrast, samples with lower spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages did not evince any merging. instead of this, they showed a supernumerary tooth primordium which arose from persisting r <dig> with its own shh signaling domain.  the prolongation of shh expression was strengthened with decreasing spry <dig> gene dosage. the prolongation of shh expression in preceding signaling domain implies later start of subsequent expression domain. black arrowheads represent the moment where the early m <dig> shh signaling domain appeared and it co-existed transiently with the persisting shh expression in r <dig>  dashed black line suggests the trend of prolongation of shh expression in r <dig> rudiment according to decreasing spry <dig> gene dosage. the colored frames  represent referential presence of signaling domains of ms , r <dig>  and m <dig>  observed in wt mice  <cit> . the green dashed line is a reference line representing m <dig>  signaling center appearance in control genotype . the density of harvested embryos is shown by dots in bars. pink dots represent embryos with supernumerary tooth germ formation. orange arrow determines continuation of yellow bar given by harvested material with higher body-weight out of the graph field. gaps between colored bars mean absence of material.



lower spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages
the further five genotypes formed a group with lower spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages, where both alleles of at least one of spry <dig> or spry <dig> genes are mutant . the distinction was found in temporal-spatial distribution of shh signaling domains compared to the samples with higher spry2;spry <dig> dosages during development . shh was expressed in the signaling centers of r <dig> and m <dig> similarly to the specimens with higher spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages. however, there was a prolongation of the shh expression in r <dig> resulting in delayed start of shh expression in m <dig> compared to control . this became more evident with decreasing dosages of spry <dig> genes . moreover, the shh expression domains of the r <dig> and m <dig> never merged together . this non-fusion resulted in the formation of a supernumerary tooth primordium from the autonomous development of the unmerged r <dig> rudiment anteriorly to m <dig> tooth germ.figure  <dig> differences in the tooth development according to the dosages of spry <dig> and spry <dig> genes. bright field images of dissociated epithelia combined with gfp visualization of shh expression  supplemented with gfp only panels  show distinct patterns of shh signaling domains during tooth development in mouse mandible.  in specimens with similar body weights , it means at the same level of the development, the dissociated epithelia in the samples with higher spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages  already show merging of r <dig>  and early m <dig>  shh signaling domains preceding the pek formation of prospective functional m <dig>  in contrast, samples with lower spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages exhibit only single r <dig> signaling domain  or separate shh signaling domains of r <dig>  and m <dig>  .  the persisting r <dig> rudiment in the genotypes with lower spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages gives rise to a supernumerary tooth primordium  in front of m <dig> at later stages . anterior direction is on the left side .



supernumerary tooth formation
we evaluated all samples for presence of the supernumerary tooth primordium . the supernumerary tooth primordium occurred in all evaluated genotypes , but its appearance varied depending on the sprouty gene dosages. with decreasing spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages, the incidence of the supernumerary tooth primordium increased. the development of dental epithelium in the cheek region was different between the embryos with higher and lower spry gene dosages . the genotypes with higher spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages  showed normal progress of tooth development in the cheek region . in contrast, in the genotypes with lower spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages  only the early shape of dental epithelium exhibiting ms expression domain was similar to control samples . however, when the ms signal disappeared, the anterior part of the epithelium enlarged and reached a “button”-shape . the posterior part of dental epithelium was narrow with a straight tail. in the middle of the enlarged anterior part, a rounded shh signaling domain was located corresponding to the r <dig> signaling domain and persisting until later stages as a signaling center in the separate supernumerary tooth primordium. during the subsequent development, the posterior part of the dental epithelium in the cheek region was extended forming the m <dig> cap with an elliptical shh expression domain while the anterior part did not change. then, both parts developed into two separate tooth primordia: supernumerary tooth germ and m <dig> germ .

the tracing of the fate of cells expressing shh in supernumerary tooth primordium
to investigate the relationship of the r <dig> shh signaling domain and supernumerary tooth primordium formation in mouse embryonic mandible, we generated spry4−/−shhercre mouse strain and spry4−/−rosa26-lacz line. these mice exhibited dental phenotype of spry <dig> deficient mice and allowed preparing tamoxifen inducible cre-loxp system for tracing of the fate of cells expressing shh in r <dig> rudiment in mice with supernumerary tooth formation.

the tamoxifen dose was administrated into pregnant female mouse at e <dig> , it means before the fusion of original r <dig> and early m <dig> shh signaling domain under physiological conditions. embryos were harvested at e <dig>  and  <dig> , when only m <dig> pek was present in controls . x-gal staining visualized the cells expressing shh  from the time of tamoxifen injection and all their descendants until harvesting of embryos. we found two distinct and separate blue areas in the cheek region of spry <dig> deficient mouse mandibles. histological sections showed that the posterior area of the blue cells was located in the m <dig> primordium, and the anterior area of the blue cells was located in the center of the supernumerary tooth cap . this proved the persistence of cells of the originally separate r <dig> shh signaling domain in the center of the supernumerary tooth primordium. these blue-labelled cells of the r <dig> were separated by a negative zone from the labelled cells of the m <dig>  they did not mix with the cells expressing shh and their descendants in the early m <dig>  it implies that the fusion of original r <dig> shh expression domain with early m <dig> shh domain was absent and the formation of m <dig> pek was disrupted. this resulted in the pathological development of the tooth row. the group of cells expressing shh in original r <dig> rudiment and their descendants remained separate as the proper signaling center of the supernumerary tooth.figure  <dig> the tracing of cells originally expressing shh in tooth primordia visualized by x-gal staining. left – whole mount staining of the lower jaw, right - corresponding histological sections. the shh expressing cells and their descendants in the r <dig> rudiment and m <dig> germ are compared during supernumerary tooth formation in spry4-/- mutants and control mice. the tamoxifen dose was administrated into pregnant female mice lacz  and spry4-/-lacz  at e <dig> , because shh is expressed in r <dig> rudiment in this time. in control embryos, merging of two labelled descendant cell populations in areas of original r <dig>  and m <dig>  at e <dig>  was clearly detectable  leading to a single area of blue cells in m <dig> germ at e <dig>  . in contrast, spry4-/-lacz embryos showed two isolated areas of blue cells indicating descendant cell populations of original r <dig>  and m <dig>  at e <dig>   as well as at e <dig>  . the area between descendant original r <dig> and m <dig> showed no shh expression . the anterior area of blue cells was located in the center of developing supernumerary tooth primordium  originating in the r <dig> rudiment. black arrows indicate the areas of tooth germs shown on histology without shh expression. the scale bar indicates 2 mm on whole mount, or 100 μm on slices.



discussion
the presence of dental rudiments in the antemolar space of mouse embryonic jaws has been previously demonstrated on the basis of a combination of histology, morphometry and 3d reconstructions  <cit> . it has been shown that the shh expression domains of individual structures  appear sequentially in the anterior-posterior series in the cheek region of the mouse embryonic mandible  <cit> .

formation of primary enamel knot
it is generally accepted that pek starts to appear at the tip of tooth bud  and is clearly detectable at cap stage   <cit> . according to our results, there are two isolated shh expression domains appearing in r <dig> and m <dig> primordia in the cheek region of mandible that have been already detected in wt mice  <cit> . the sensitive detection using isolated epithelia in the present study clearly documented the transient synchronous co-expression of shh in the r <dig> rudiment and original early m <dig> and their following fusion between e <dig>  and  <dig>  forming one composite shh expression domain – called pek in the center of prospective functional m <dig>  based on this new insight, the original early shh expression in m <dig> should not be identified as pek, since the typical oblong pek in m <dig> germ forms as late as after the fusion of the former shh signaling centers in the r <dig> rudiment and original m <dig> germ.

non-fusion of r <dig> and m <dig> shh expression domains results in supernumerary primordium formation
molecular and genetic studies over the last twenty years have shown that the development of dentition is a dynamic and very complex process controlled by numerous signaling pathways. these processes determine the appropriate shape, number and pattern of teeth  <cit> . it is obvious that errors can occur during such complicated process, resulting in formation of oral pathologies  <cit> .

presence of supernumerary teeth belongs to pathological condition  <cit> . they have been found in the antemolar space in several mouse mutant strains, for example, in transgenic mice with overexpressed ectodysplasin  or its receptor   <cit> , or in ectodin-deficient mice  <cit> . similarly, a supernumerary tooth in front of molars also develops in spry <dig> or spry <dig> deficient mice  <cit> .

in the present study, the fusion between the shh expressing domains r <dig> and m <dig> was standardly apparent in control genotype and in the mice with a higher dosages of spry genes  where the supernumerary tooth forms only very rarely. in contrast, the genotypes with lower spry gene dosages, did not exhibit the fusion of r <dig> and m <dig> shh signaling domains. . the lack of fusion resulted in supernumerary tooth primordium formation in majority of embryos according to genotype. the r <dig> shh signaling domain stayed separate anteriorly to the persisting original early m <dig> shh domain and the r <dig> bud developed progressively into a supernumerary tooth primordium . this provides clear evidence that in mutant mice with an extra tooth in front of m <dig>  the r <dig> shh signaling domain indicates a signaling center of separately evolving supernumerary tooth. the r <dig> rudiment in such cases develops autonomously giving rise to the supernumerary tooth primordium, instead of being incorporated into the m <dig> 

this phenomenon was confirmed by cre-loxp technology allowing the tracing of the cells originally expressing shh in two separate domains in r <dig> and m1primordia that are finally localized in one area of m <dig> germ at e <dig>  . in contrast, in spry <dig> deficient embryos, a presence of two separate areas of cells originally expressing shh in a supernumerary tooth germ and in m <dig> germ documented the non-fusion of r <dig> and m <dig> shh expression domains at e <dig>  with a consequent supernumerary tooth formation anteriorly to m <dig> primordium .

in the present study, the number of the supernumerary tooth germs decreased in developmentally more advanced specimens . regression of the supernumerary tooth primordium has been previously also reported in spry4−/− and spry2−/− mice. the presence of supernumerary tooth germ during prenatal development has been detected to be significantly higher than the presence of supernumerary tooth in adults sprouty deficient mice  <cit> .

in general, the supernumerary teeth were more frequent with decreasing dosages of spry2;spry <dig>  which demonstrates essential roles of sprouty genes for normal tooth development and patterning.

sprouty gene dosages
the influence of dose of mutant genes on mouse phenotype has been confirmed previously. variation of pax <dig> mutant alleles causes oligodontia, hypoplastic or missing lower incisors and third molars in mouse  <cit> . palate development is sensitive to spry <dig> dose  <cit> . using spry mutant mice, the loss of function in spry genes results in the increased number of incisors in the upper jaw  <cit> .

our data document that the presence of rudimentary and functional tooth germs is not totally disrupted by lacking spry genes. however, the dosages of sprouty <dig> and sprouty <dig> genes affect the timing and formation of the early tooth primordia in the cheek region of mouse mandible. the consequent appearance of shh expression domains in three distinct areas corresponded to those observed in controls, but the expression was slightly prolonged. the prolongation was followed by a delay  of the shh expressions in r <dig> and m <dig> areas compared to control genotype. interestingly, the prolongation of the shh expression was more obvious with the decreasing dosage of spry <dig> gene . this suggests that spry <dig> has a higher impact in tooth development than spry <dig> 

molecular regulation of supernumerary tooth primordium formation
sprouty genes belong to evolutionarily conserved family and they are essential for the normal development of craniofacial structures including dentition. they encode a negative regulator of fgf and other rtk  signaling and indirectly influence the expression of shh  <cit> .

it has been reported that mutations in spry <dig> or spry <dig> genes cause the formation of a supernumerary tooth in mouse diastema through increased fgf signaling  <cit> . fgf signaling pathway is active in the epithelium and mesenchyme and plays a role in the stimulation of cell proliferation  <cit> . it also prevents apoptosis  <cit> . this is in agreement with findings that after loss of function of the sprouty genes and increased fgf signaling  <cit>  the apoptosis is reduced and cell proliferation is increased in the area of dental rudiments ms and r <dig>  <cit> . such rudiment “revitalization” results in the formation of the supernumerary tooth primordium  <cit> . several genes from fgf family induce shh expression, which then affects other members of fgf family  <cit> . this feedback model was confirmed in supernumerary tooth in spry <dig> deficient mice  <cit>  and also in the limb buds development in mice  <cit> . according to this the increased fgf expression could prolong the shh expression.

developmental arrest of the supernumerary tooth development in spry mutant mice
frequency of the supernumerary tooth presence in the erupted dentition has been detected to be substantially lower than prenatal presence of supernumerary tooth primordium  <cit> . based on our results we tried to explain this phenomenon and outline hypothetically the signaling pathways that could stop supernumerary primordium development in spry2;spry <dig> mutant mice during later prenatal period.

interaction between shh and wnt signaling has been proven during tooth development, where shh acts as a negative feedback regulator of wnt in diastemal tooth development  <cit> . wise-null mice have shown that reduction of shh activity leads to continuous r <dig> development by increased wnt signaling  <cit> . using feedback model  <cit>  we can propose that the shh signaling is strongly upregulated by an increased fgf signaling in spry2;spry <dig> double-knockout mice. it is known that shh is required for separation of teeth  <cit>  by antagonizing wnt signaling  <cit> . using these knowledge we suggest a model explaining why supernumerary tooth primordia ceased to be detected at later stages in some genotypes  in diastema . the maintenance of shh signaling is involved in the separation of r <dig> rudiment from the developing first molar and indicates formation of supernumerary tooth primordium . higher level of shh should strongly antagonize wnt signaling, which is necessary for proper tooth development. decreased levels of wnt might stop continuous r <dig> development and the primordium of supernumerary tooth regress. this would mean that shh modulates the levels of wnt signaling during tooth development . however, the question remains, why some tooth primordia still develop into erupted supernumerary teeth  <cit> .figure  <dig> a tentative model of molecular control of formation and inhibition of supernumerary tooth development in mouse lower diastema in spry2;spry <dig> mutants. in wild-type mouse embryos , spry2/spry <dig> antagonizes fgf signaling  <cit>  and thus indirectly influences shh level  <cit> . shh is a negative regulator of wnt  <cit>  and plays a role in tooth separation  <cit> . in spry2;spry <dig> mutants  loss of function of the sprouty genes leads to increasing of fgf signaling  <cit> . this results in a reduction of apoptosis and stimulation of cell proliferation in the ms and r <dig> rudiments, which results in the formation of the supernumerary tooth primordium  <cit> . higher level of fgf causes a higher level of shh, which helps r <dig> rudiment to separate from m <dig> tooth germ. however, the elevated shh strongly inhibits the wnt signaling, decreased wnt signaling cannot prevent an independent development of r <dig> rudiment as supernumerary tooth primordium, which finally regresses. the thickness of lines and frames symbolizes approximate levels of signaling activity.



the present data document that changes of spry <dig> and spry <dig> gene dosages have consequences for developmental dynamics and patterning of tooth primordia and that increasing spry <dig> and spry <dig> gene dosages allow approaching the normal tooth development in mutants.

CONCLUSIONS
the shh signaling domain of r <dig> rudiment transiently synchronously co-exists with early m <dig> shh signaling domain.

these two signaling domains finally fuse together giving rise to pek in prospective functional m <dig> germ between e <dig>  and  <dig>   under physiological conditions.

by contrast, the non-fusion of original r <dig> and early m <dig> shh signaling domains results in the subsequent development of the supernumerary tooth primordium on the base of r <dig> rudiment.

the formation of the supernumerary tooth germs depends on the dosages of sprouty <dig> and sprouty <dig> genes – the number of supernumeraries increases with decreasing spry2;spry <dig> gene dosages.
