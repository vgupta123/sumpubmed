BACKGROUND
vj recombination leads to the assembly of genes encoding for the immunoglobulin and t-cell receptors , and as a result is a fundamental process in the development of lymphocytes  <cit> . in the germline configuration, genes encoding the antigen-binding region of these receptors are divided into separate classes of genetic coding segments termed v , d , and j . each gene segment is flanked by a recombination signal sequence  that contains both a conserved heptamer and a conserved nonamer sequence element separated by a spacer of either  <dig> ±  <dig>  or  <dig> ±  <dig>  base pairs. recombination events are limited by the "12/ <dig> rule" to those in which a pair of rss participate, one 12-spacer signal and one 23-spacer signal  <cit> .

the initial site-specific dna cleavage steps in the vj recombination mechanism are catalyzed by rag <dig> and rag <dig>  <cit> . once the rag proteins have created the double-strand breaks, the appropriate joining of both the coding and signal ends require factors that mediate nonhomologous dna end joining  <cit> . there is evidence that the rag proteins may prefer to assemble first on the 12-rss to form the single rss complex  <cit> , followed by recruitment of the 23-rss to form the paired complex  <cit> . the dna-bending proteins, hmgb <dig> or hmgb <dig>  facilitate formation of the latter complex  <cit> . the rag proteins form dna double strand breaks in two successive catalytic steps  <cit> . first, a dna nick is generated between the coding gene segment and the heptamer of the rss. second, a dna hairpin is formed by a transesterification reaction in which the 3'oh at the coding end is coupled to the phosphate group between the rss and the gene segment on the opposing strand. the resulting products are a 5'-phosphorylated double-strand break at the signal end and a covalently closed hairpin at the coding end  <cit> . the macromolecular assemblies differ for each of the catalytic steps, with hairpin formation requiring the presence of both the  <dig> and 23-rss in the paired complex, whereas nicking may be carried out on a 12-rss in the single rss complex  <cit> . thus, to understand the parameters for both dna cleavage steps, it is important to characterize both the single rss and paired complexes. significant questions remain about the architecture of both of these catalytically active complexes. for example, there have been conflicting reports concerning the stoichiometry of the rag proteins in the vj recombinase. specifically, the stoichiometry of rag <dig> was reported as dimer both in the single rss complex  <cit>  and in the paired complex  <cit> . conversely, a separate study concluded that at least a trimer of rag <dig> was present in both the single rss and the paired complexes  <cit> .

both rag proteins are required for catalytic activity. however, the core region of rag <dig> j recombination activity) contains the active site motif and the relevant dna binding domains that recognize the rss heptamer and nonamer. rag <dig> residues d <dig>  d <dig>  and e <dig> constitute the dde motif active site, with these residues acting to coordinate the divalent metal cations essential for the dna cleavage functions  <cit> . in addition, rag <dig> residues 384– <dig> mediate dna binding to the rss nonamer  <cit> , while the binding site for the rss heptamer is located in the central domain   <cit> . the dna binding capabilities of rag <dig> alone may be significant since it is not clear if the vj recombinase binds to the rss as a pre-formed complex, or if rag <dig> binds first, followed by rag <dig>  it is also not known if the total amount of rag <dig> in developing lymphocytes is complexed with rag <dig>  or if there is a separate pool of free rag <dig>  in addition, rag <dig> protein levels, but not rag <dig>  are cell cycle regulated, with increasing degradation occurring at the transition from g <dig> to the s phase  <cit> . thus, there may be times in the cell cycle when only rag <dig> is present. as a result it is important to determine the characteristics of rag <dig> in the absence of rag <dig> 

rag <dig>  expressed and purified from bacteria, has been shown to exist in multiple, oligomeric forms  <cit> . however, little is known about rag <dig> oligomerization interfaces since a high-resolution structure of core rag <dig> has yet to be determined. nevertheless, a recently reported crystal structure of a eukaryotic transposase, hermes transposase, has yielded a feasible model for the overall topology of core rag <dig>  <cit> . similar to the rag-mediated dna cleavage mechanism, hermes transposase catalyzes hairpin formation on the flanking dna rather than the signal ends  <cit> . significantly, the crystal structure of hermes transposase revealed the presence of three structural domains  <cit> , which may reflect how the three domains identified in core rag <dig>  <cit>  are oriented in the tertiary structure. hermes was shown to be active as a dimer, but full activity required formation of a hexamer  <cit> . likewise, characterization of the oligomeric properties of rag <dig> is important to determine its requirement for full catalytic activity. to this end, previous studies demonstrated that core rag <dig> was predominantly dimeric in solution  <cit> , although higher order species, namely tetramer and octamer, were observed  <cit> . the relative proportions of tetrameric and octameric rag <dig> increased significantly at ionic strengths approaching physiological conditions  <cit> . however, it was not clear if these higher order oligomeric forms of rag <dig> directly contributed in the vj recombination reaction.

in this study we investigated the self-association properties of rag <dig> as a function of temperature, with an emphasis on the temperature range of 10–37°c. dimer and octamer forms of rag <dig>  but not tetramer, were detectable over the entire temperature range studied. however, only the dimer species maintained interaction with the rss and rag <dig>  and is thus the form likely present in the catalytically active complex. significantly, although dimeric rag <dig> is the active form, it is highly susceptible to aggregation even at relatively low temperatures. the tendency for aggregation may be driven by small changes in protein conformation, although it is not associated with the global unfolding transition of rag <dig>  significantly, the major vj recombinase:rss complex, formed after incubation at 37°c, contained rag <dig> and a single dimer of rag <dig>  in contrast to lower temperatures where multiple protein-dna complexes were formed. these results suggest that the rag <dig> dimer is preferentially stabilized over higher order oligomers in the presence of rag <dig>  overall, the characterizations of rag <dig> in this study have resulted in a more complete picture of the biophysical properties of this protein, and will be valuable in further investigations of macromolecular interactions mediated by rag <dig> during vj recombination.

RESULTS
temperature-dependent self-association properties of mcr1
recombinant core rag <dig>  expressed and purified from bacteria as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein , was previously shown to be active in in vitro dna cleavage assays when combined with rag <dig> purified from 293t cells  <cit> . recombinant core rag <dig>  is produced in a soluble form at relatively high levels from this system, which has been useful for characterizing fundamental physicochemical properties of this protein. in contrast, production of the full length rag <dig> protein in bacteria, to date, only yielded aggregated and inactive protein .

the final purification step of the mbp-core rag <dig> fusion protein  was size exclusion chromatography  using a  <dig> ml superdex  <dig> gel filtration column . the sec purification step was used to separate the dimeric form of mcr <dig> from aggregated material that eluted in the void volume. in addition to the dimeric form of the protein, higher order oligomeric forms of the protein were generated. in this study, and also as done previously  <cit> , we focused on the characterization of three fractions of mcr <dig>  that were pooled after the preparative sec gel filtration step .

the separate fractions were further characterized using multi-angle laser light scattering combined with sec, referred to as malls-sec. the sec was performed using a  <dig> ml analytical superdex  <dig> column that resulted in a significantly higher resolution for the separation of the mcr <dig> oligomeric species than the preparative sec column, especially for fraction c. the elution profiles of all three fractions obtained from malls-sec at 10°c are shown in figure  <dig>  consistent with our previous results  <cit> , mcr <dig> self-associated as tetrameric and octameric forms, in addition to the dimeric form. specifically, the elution profile of fraction a showed two distinct peaks  that corresponded in molecular mass to tetrameric  and dimeric  mcr <dig> . the elution profile of fraction b also showed two distinct peaks ; however, the first resolved peak eluted over a broad volume range  and was more polydisperse in molecular mass , indicating co-elution of multiple oligomers . lastly, a resolved peak  in the elution profile of fraction c  corresponded to octameric mcr <dig> as determined by malls-sec analysis . the elution profile of fraction c also included a small peak at ve max of  <dig>  ml. the concentration of protein eluting at this volume was too low to yield an accurate molecular mass; however, the ve max is consistent with dimeric mcr <dig>  the first peak in each of the chromatograms in figure 2b corresponded to protein that eluted in the void volume of the column, and likely included misfolded and/or non-specifically aggregated protein.

previously, the relative proportions of the dimer, tetramer, and octamer forms of mcr <dig> as a function of ionic strength were examined  <cit> . at high ionic strengths  it was found that the dimer form was favored; however, at near physiological ionic strengths  the total protein was comprised of an increased proportion of both the tetramer and octamer forms. while the different oligomeric mcr <dig> forms appeared to re-establish equilibria after changes in ionic strength, the redistribution occurred slowly . therefore, the octamer could dissociate to smaller oligomers, albeit slowly, indicating that it was not formed by nonspecific aggregation of misfolded protein  <cit> . it is not likely mcr <dig> oligomers of a higher order than octamer exist, since protein that eluted in the void volume did not dissociate to lower oligomeric forms even at high ionic strengths  <cit> .

our findings of the three distinct oligomeric forms of rag <dig> coupled with the contradictory reports of rag <dig> stoichiometry in catalytically-active complexes  <cit>  led us to further investigate the self-association properties of this protein. in this study we examined how the self-association properties of mcr <dig> varied with temperature . fractions a, b, and c were each incubated at the indicated temperatures for  <dig> min prior to analysis by sec. with increasing temperature, the proportion of tetrameric protein appeared to decrease in fraction b , as well as in fraction a . in fraction a, the only retained peak at the higher temperatures contained dimeric mcr <dig>  likewise, in fraction b, the proportion of tetrameric mcr <dig> in the broad peak at 10°c appeared to decrease at the higher temperatures, yielding resolved peaks with ve values consistent with the dimer and octamer forms only . it is likely that the reduction in the tetrameric form at temperatures higher than 10°c was due either to dissociation to the dimer form, or more likely, association to higher order oligomeric forms. with fraction c, the octamer peak was present in the elution profiles over the entire temperature range of 10–37°c .

the dimer form of rag <dig> preferentially interacts with the rss, rag <dig>  and catalyzes dna cleavage
of the resolved mcr <dig> species from sec , fractions a and c contained predominantly dimer or octamer species, respectively . in contrast, fraction b contained a mixture of oligomers, with the tetramer form only detectable at the lower temperatures . it is feasible that octameric rag <dig> could contribute to rag <dig> function in vj recombination, due to its presence at physiological temperatures. to assess this possibility, we compared fractions a and c in rag1-related functions, including binding to 12-rss, complex formation with rag <dig>  and dna cleavage in a single 12-rss cleavage assay.

to test for the affinity of binding to a single 12-rss, electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were performed. increasing concentrations of mcr <dig> fractions a and c were incubated with radiolabeled 12-rss prior to electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions. fraction a  formed multiple complexes with the rss at protein concentrations of less than  <dig>  μm , consistent with our previous results in which we showed that mcr <dig> can form two major complexes with a single 12-rss prior to saturation of the dna  <cit> . in previous studies it was determined that the fastest migrating mcr1:rss complex in the nondenaturing gel contained a single mcr <dig> dimer  <cit> , whereas the slower migrating complex contained four mcr <dig> subunits bound to the 12-rss  <cit> .

the band labeled in figure 4a as the 4-subunit mcr1:12-rss complex may form from the interaction of the pre-formed tetramer or from two separate mcr <dig> dimers with the rss. while there is some evidence that this complex may contain pre-formed tetramer  <cit> , it is more likely that it is due to the binding of two separate dimers to the rss, since  the pre-formed tetramer is less evident at 25°c . however, in the event that two separate mcr <dig> dimers bind the rss, it is not clear if both dimers form contacts with the rss. additionally, if the two dimers form contacts with each other on the rss, then it is not possible to determine by emsa if the interface is the same as that in the pre-formed tetramer. due to these limitations, the slower mobility complex will be referred to as a 4-subunit mcr1:rss complex rather than a tetrameric mcr1:rss complex .

a greater than 10-fold increase in the concentration of mcr <dig> fraction c was required to shift an equivalent fraction of the rss as compared to fraction a . it is likely, however, that the dna binding observed in fraction c was due to small amount of dimer present in this sample . moreover, the relative migration of the protein-dna complexes in the gel was the same between fractions a and c. since the fastest migrating band corresponds to dimeric mcr <dig> bound to the 12-rss, this would be inconsistent with pre-formed mcr <dig> octamer forming a complex with the 12-rss.

to compare the interaction of fractions a and c with rag <dig>  a pull-down assay using core rag <dig> fused to glutathione s-transferase  was performed. gst-core rag <dig> was incubated with the mcr <dig> fractions in the presence of glutathione-sepharose resin. after extensive washing of the resin with binding buffer, the proteins were released from the resin, resolved by sds-page, and analyzed by western blot . mcr <dig> fraction a, but not fraction c, bound to gst-core rag <dig> under the conditions used here. it is possible that within the octameric form, the rag <dig> subunits may be associated in a way that shields both the rss and rag <dig> binding sites.

as expected from the lack of rss or rag <dig> binding, mcr <dig> fraction c was inactive in a single rss cleavage assay . in this assay, both mcr <dig> fractions were incubated separately with gst-core rag <dig> followed by the addition of double-stranded wt 12-rss. as shown in figure 4c , dimeric mcr <dig>  was catalytically active and formed the hairpin and nicked products, whereas the octameric mcr <dig>  was inactive even with increased concentrations of protein from fraction c .

it was somewhat surprising that fraction c showed no evidence of dna cleavage activity or interaction with rag <dig>  given that this fraction contained a small proportion of dimeric mcr <dig>  it is possible that dissociation of the octameric protein to a dimeric form resulted in protein in an inactive conformation. nevertheless, it is apparent that fraction a isolated by preparative sec contains the active form of mcr <dig> 

conformational changes in rag <dig> as a function of temperature
although the dimeric form of mcr <dig> was the most effective at carrying out rag <dig> functions, the relative proportion of the dimeric form in fraction a was substantially decreased with increasing temperature, with the majority of protein in an aggregated state at  <dig> and 37°c . specifically, ~60% of the total protein in fraction a was dimeric at 10°c, whereas <10% was dimeric at temperatures of 25°c and greater, with the remainder aggregated in an inactive form. the aggregation occurred within an incubation period of  <dig> min at two temperatures tested, with no further aggregation occurring between  <dig> to  <dig> min incubation times .

to determine if the aggregation of dimeric mcr <dig> was due to protein unfolding, we measured the thermal denaturation of dimeric mcr <dig>  by circular dichroism  spectroscopy. the protein showed two transitions with a minor transition occurring between  <dig> to ~37°c and a major transition at ~55°c . both transitions were irreversible under the conditions used here. notably, the major protein unfolding transition occurred at higher temperatures  than the range of interest . the denaturation curve of mbp alone was also measured, with the transition temperature for mbp unfolding at ~57°c, with a relatively constant cd signal from 10–50°c . therefore, it is consistent that the minor transition between 20–37°c is due to the rag <dig> portion of mcr <dig>  and thus this transition may reflect conformational changes that occur upon oligomerization of the protein.

a less likely possibility for the minor cd transition between 20–37°c could be due to a temperature dependent disruption in an interface formed between the core rag <dig> and mbp portions of the fusion protein. a change in cd signal of the magnitude observed here would result from significant changes in the secondary structure of one or the other proteins upon complex dissociation. we believe such an interaction to be unlikely in this case since previous attempts to detect association between mbp and core rag <dig>  by various methods, such as chromatography and protein-protein crosslinking, were unsuccessful .

the cd spectra for mcr <dig> incubated at 20°c, 30°c, and 37°c for  <dig> min are shown in figure 6b. at 10–20°c, mcr <dig> is predicted to contain 52% α-helices and 14% β-sheet, whereas at 37°c, the proportion of α-helical structure is decreased by 10%. since the transition between 20–37°c was irreversible, there may be a time-dependent shift in the cd signal within this temperature range. additionally, it was important to confirm that protein incubated at temperatures between 20–37°c did not enter into the major unfolding transition over time. to analyze time-dependent changes in the conformation within this temperature range, cd spectra were collected over a 2-hour incubation period at 20°c, 30°c, and 37°c. at temperatures representing the beginning and end of the first minor transition , there were no changes in either set of cd spectra over a  <dig> hr time period . therefore, mcr <dig> remained in its low temperature folded state at 20°c, while at 37°c the protein had obtained a stable intermediate conformation. after incubation at 30°c, the cd spectra changed slowly with time, with the final spectrum at  <dig> hr incubation matching the spectrum obtained at 37°c. this was expected, given the irreversibility of the minor transition. in conclusion, the majority of aggregation of dimeric mcr <dig> occurred between 20–37°c, which coincided with an irreversible minor transition in the thermal denaturation profile. the minor transition may be due to unfolding of a small region in core rag <dig> that increases the propensity for nonspecific aggregation.

temperature dependent association of the vj recombinase and the rss
in previous studies it was shown that rag <dig> could bind to both the 2-subunit mcr1:12-rss and the 4-subunit mcr1:12-rss complexes following incubation at 25°c  <cit> . since these complexes may be due to either one or two active rag <dig> dimers bound to the 12-rss, we asked if both of these complexes may be relevant to rag <dig> function at 37°c. here, we monitored the formation of the mcr1:rag2:12-rss complexes as a function of temperature. upon incubation at  <dig> and 25°c, two complexes were formed , as has been previously observed under these conditions  <cit> . the addition of gst-core rag <dig> substantially increased the level of protein-dna complexes formed , which may be due either to rag2-induced conformational changes in rag <dig> or to additional contacts formed between rag <dig> and the rss.

significantly, upon incubation at 37°c, the higher mobility mcr1:gst-core rag <dig> complex with 12-rss  was maintained, while the level of complex  <dig> was significantly diminished . there appears to be a slightly lower binding affinity overall at 37°c given the increased amount of unbound 12-rss . however, the addition of hmgb <dig> also showed decreased formation of the slower mobility complex  <dig> at 37°c, but with no significant increase in unbound 12-rss . overall, in both lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  there was robust formation of complex  <dig>  but with little evidence of complex  <dig>  this is in contrast to lower temperatures where both complexes are observed, particularly after saturation of the oligonucleotide duplex . complexes  <dig> and  <dig> were both catalytically active, with nicking and hairpin formation detected by an in-gel dna cleavage assay . in this assay, the gel slices containing complexes  <dig> and  <dig>  were tested for dna cleavage activity. moreover, it should be noted that since dna cleavage activity must be performed at 37°c, it is possible that a rag <dig> dimer could dissociate from complex  <dig>  effectively forming complex  <dig> 

mcr <dig> purified from mammalian cells showed similar results, as mcr <dig> and gst-core rag <dig> protein co-expressed in 293t cells primarily formed complex  <dig>  with incubation at 25°c . further, complex  <dig> remained the predominant complex formed even after saturation of the 12-rss substrate with increasing concentrations of the co-expressed rag proteins . overall, it appears that complex  <dig> is the most stable rag1:rag2:rss complex observed under various conditions, which is consistent with the findings from the physicochemical characterizations that the dimeric form of mcr <dig> is the relevant oligomer that functions in vj recombination. we have previously assigned rag1:rag2:rss complexes  <dig> and  <dig>  as gst-core rag <dig> bound to the 2-subunit and 4-subunit mcr1:12-rss complexes, respectively  <cit> . there is a possibility that complex  <dig> could be due to the binding of additional gst-core rag <dig> subunits to the 2-subunit mcr1:12-rss complex, which would correspond to the previously reported complexes "sc1" and "sc2" that contain  <dig> and  <dig> subunits of rag <dig> bound to the rag <dig> dimer:rss complex, respectively  <cit> . however, we do not believe that this is the case, but rather, under the conditions used here, only one physiologically relevant rag1:rag2:12-rss complex can form . this may be due to the use of a gst tag on rag <dig> in our system, which could preclude formation of an 'sc1' complex containing a single subunit of rag <dig> given that the gst moiety is known to dimerize  <cit> .

to test the oligomeric state of gst-core rag <dig>  malls-sec was performed on the purified protein . in summary, the major oligomeric form of gst-core rag <dig> detected was dimer , with possibly minor amounts of tetramer , but no obvious monomeric species present. specifically, protein eluting in the predominant peak  was at a molar mass consistent with the dimer form. material eluting in a shoulder of this peak  was also at a molar mass consistent with dimeric gst-core rag <dig>   lastly, a peak with ve of  <dig>  ml  yielded a molar mass of  <dig> kd. peak  <dig> is likely due to the presence of a contaminating protein, which is evident on coomassie blue-stained sds polyacrylamide gels at ~ <dig> kda. the contaminating protein does not appear to be derived from either gst  or the core rag <dig> portion  of the fusion protein. moreover, protein eluting in peak  <dig> could be not be detected by western blotting against a monoclonal α-gst antibody . finally, mcr <dig> combined with material eluting in peak  <dig>  but not peak  <dig>  resulted in the formation of complex  <dig>  by emsa and formed hairpin products in dna cleavage assays . as the protein concentration eluting in peak  <dig> varied between 40– <dig> nm, which is within the range of protein concentration used in these studies , we surmise that gst-core rag <dig> is in the dimeric state. these results are consistent with previous studies, which showed that dimeric gst unfolds in a two-state mechanism to denatured monomers, indicating that a monomeric folded form of gst is highly unstable  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have shown that self-association of rag <dig> is temperature dependent from  <dig> to 37°c. characterization of the temperature dependent variation in rag <dig> oligomerization is essential, especially since the binding interactions of rag <dig> with rss have typically been examined at either 4°c or 25°c, but dna cleavage activity is monitored at 37°c. in summary, we found that the relative proportions of each rag <dig> oligomer changed significantly as the temperature varied from 10–37°c. while the dimer and octamer forms were observed over this entire temperature range, the tetrameric protein was only detected at the lowest temperatures studied. although both the rag <dig> dimer and octamer forms were present at physiological temperature, only the dimer-containing sample was active in dna binding, rag <dig> interaction, and in dna cleavage. in contrast, the octamer-containing sample appeared to show no significant activity in any of the assays tested, indicating that this higher order pre-formed oligomer cannot contribute to rag <dig> activity in vj recombination.

we conclude that the single rag <dig> dimer:rss complex is the physiologically relevant moiety, since this complex with rag <dig> incorporated is preferentially formed at 37°c with separately expressed proteins, and is the predominant complex formed with co-expressed proteins. altogether, these results show that at physiological temperature only a single dimer of rag <dig> is stably incorporated into the catalytically-active vj recombinase:rss complex. thus, we are in agreement with previous reports that the stoichiometry of the physiologically-relevant vj recombinase consists of two rag <dig> subunits  <cit> .

significantly, our finding that dimeric rag <dig> aggregates upon a minor conformational change in the temperature range of  <dig> to 37°c was previously not known. understanding such physicochemical properties of rag <dig> under different conditions is necessary for the interpretation of experiments conducted in solution, and may be useful in determining conditions to perform structural studies of this protein.
