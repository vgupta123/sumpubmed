BACKGROUND
intelectins are glycoproteins with an approximate subunit size of  <dig> kda, that have been described in mammals, fish and amphibians. the genome sequence of the sea squirt ciona intestinalis  <cit>  shows the presence of closely-related genes, indicating that intelectins arose early in chordate evolution. in mammals, intelectins have so far been described in humans  <cit> , mice  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , cattle  <cit>  and pigs  <cit> , although interestingly, the dog genome  <cit>  apparently lacks any intelectin genes.

the three-dimensional structures of intelectins have not yet been elucidated. much of the predicted protein sequence is highly conserved across species, including eight cysteine residues and a fibrinogen-like domain  <cit> . there has been significant interest in the functions of intelectins, which appear to be many and varied. a ca2+-dependent galactose-specific lectin activity was first detected in xenopus intelectins, such as xl <dig>  <cit> , which subsequently led to the naming of the family as "intelectins"  following the detection of a closely-related gene in mouse small intestinal paneth cells by komiya et al.  <cit> . due to the cellular localisation of expression of this gene, currently denoted itln <dig> or itlna, a role in innate immunity was postulated.

human and mouse intelectins were shown to bind lactoferrin  <cit> , leading to the alternative nomenclature of "intestinal lactoferrin receptor" . additionally, transcripts identical to human intelectin- <dig>  were detected in omental fat tissue, and termed omentin by yang et al.  <cit> . these authors and others  <cit>  have investigated the metabolic significance of itln <dig>  which is present in blood plasma and is thought to function as an adipocytokine. circulating levels are inversely correlated to body mass index  <cit>  and to occurrence of type- <dig> diabetes mellitus  <cit> . a single nucleotide polymorphism in itln <dig> has also been implicated in susceptibility to crohn's disease  <cit> , and a closely-linked coding snp was also found to be associated with incidence of asthma  <cit> .

intelectin expression in the gut and lung mucosa is known to be highly up-regulated in the immune response to parasitic infections and th2-cytokine dominated allergic responses  <cit> . whilst itln <dig> is expressed in paneth cells at a high level in normal mouse small intestine, infection of balb/c mice with the small intestinal dwelling helminth trichinella spiralis, induced de novo expression of an additional gene termed intelectin- <dig>  in goblet cells, which was secreted into the mucus layer  <cit> . this gene, alternatively termed itlnb, is absent from the reference c57bl/6j genome, and it was suggested that lack of itln2/itlnb may be partially responsible for the delayed expulsion of t. spiralis in c57bl/6j mice compared to balb/c  <cit> .

in a subsequent genome-wide screen for gene copy number variation , graubert et al.  <cit>  highlighted the itln locus on distal chromosome  <dig> as a hotspot of gene duplication in most mouse strains analysed. gene duplication  <cit>  represents an evolutionary mechanism whereby populations can adapt to increase the effective dosage of an advantageous gene in the face of a particular selection pressure, such as the burden of intestinal parasites. once fixed, duplicated genes  can evolve distinct functions. in the context of responses to parasites, a notable example of gene duplication in the mouse is at the mast cell proteinase locus on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . mast cell proteinases contribute anti-parasite effector mechanisms, and the gene mcpt <dig> has been shown to enhance expulsion of t. spiralis  <cit> .

in this study, we aimed to sequence the itln locus in a non-c57bl/6j strain, in order to characterise the nature and extent of duplication of mouse itln genes. we focussed on the 129s <dig> mouse, as a bac library was available for this strain  <cit> , which is commonly used in gene deletion studies, and this information would enable the design of future specific itln knockout strategies.

RESULTS
sequencing of 129s <dig> itln locus
the itln locus on chromosome  <dig> of the celera mouse assembly  <cit>  shows multiple copies of itln genes as compared to that of the c57bl/6j reference genome. however, it is an assembly consisting of a mix of  <dig> different mouse strains  and there are about  <dig> kbp of gaps on this locus. to improve on the annotation and resolve the exact structure of the 129s <dig> itln copy number variations,  <dig> flanking bacterial artificial chromosome  clones were sequenced to a depth of ~ <dig> × using the conventional sanger sequencing method while the remaining middle two were sequenced to a much greater depth of ~300× using the illumina paired-end sequencing method. in view of the expected repetitive nature of the itln locus, the use of this tiling path sequencing strategy was necessary to minimise errors in the assembly. nevertheless, several gaps estimated  to be less than  <dig> kbp in total are yet to be bridged. gap closure over repeat elements with high level of sequence identity remains computationally challenging. the final assembly of the  <dig> bac clones yielded a scaffold of about  <dig> kbp ; adding approximately  <dig> kbp of sequences to the corresponding celera assembly. the overall sequence identity between the two is about 97%. however, there exist variable regions with sequence identity as low as 60%  suggesting potential errors in the assembly using mixed strains of mouse. the sequence and annotations of the scaffold have been deposited in the genbank with the accession number hm <dig> and a graphical representation is also available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/300085578?report=graph.

analysis of the 129s <dig> itln locus
a dotplot analysis  was first used to pinpoint regions of high similarity where the itln genes may be located. six complete or partial ~ <dig> kbp tandemly or invertedly duplicated segments could be identified on the locus. each of these segments is found to be flanked by murine endogenous retroviral  elements which have been known to mediate the host recombination  <cit> . these erv elements may well serve as the breakpoint for the recombination and expansion of the itln locus. it is perhaps no coincidence that about 43% of the 129s <dig> itln locus is made up of repeat elements. this is significantly denser than the average  <dig> % observed for the whole genome in the c57bl/6j mouse  <cit> .

in addition to the flanking genes , the ~ <dig> kbp itln locus has been predicted to be made up of  <dig> full-length itln variants , one truncated itln ,  <dig> pseudo-itln, one cd <dig> variant cd244_se, one full-length cd <dig> and  <dig> pseudo-cd <dig> . the  <dig> itln genes can be further classified into two categories based on their sizes of either ~ <dig> or ~ <dig> kbp; with itln <dig> and itln <dig> having additional line/l <dig> retrotransposable elements inserted into their respective intron  <dig>  in fact, variations also exist in the organisation of the pseduogenes on each of the duplicated segments; with some having different exons removed.

to further investigate the evolutionary basis of the seemingly active segmental duplication, an unrooted neighbour-joining tree  was constructed using intron  <dig> and its equivalent in all the itln genes and pseudogenes, respectively. with less selection pressure than the exons, introns are known to mutate more rapidly and uniformly; making them an informative phylogenomic marker. the tree shows that the full-length genes and pseudogenes are clearly separated into two distinct clades. the clustering of the pseudogenes suggests that they probably propagate by serial duplication of an existing pseudogene which may already be present within the duplicated segments together with its full-length gene. detailed sequence analysis of each of the introns shows that the insertions of erv and/or line repeats probably account for the branching of each genes and pseudogenes.

although all  <dig> exons of the itln genes can be mapped onto the  <dig> variants and their predicted mrna sequences are highly conserved , they are predicted to be expressed and probably regulated differently. both itln <dig> and itln <dig> transcripts are found to contain an early stop codon. while this is most likely to result in a truncated itln <dig>  the presence of potential ribosomal - <dig> frameshift sites identified further upstream of the stop codon at positions  <dig> and  <dig> is predicted to allow the translation of the full-length itln <dig> protein to proceed. sequence conservation among the  <dig> predicted full-length itln proteins ranges from  <dig> to 96%. not surprisingly, similar conservation is also observed when comparing the variants with the itln <dig>  of c57bl/6j; with the itln <dig> from both strains being identical to each other on the protein level. however, higher degrees of variation are found among the  <dig> itln variants and the predicted celera homologues; with the protein sequence identity ranges from  <dig> to 100% . two of celera's itln variants may also contain sites for ribosomal - <dig> frameshifting. the itln <dig> and itln <dig> genes of 129s <dig> are found to be identical to celera's itlna  and itlnb  respectively. the observed variation in the remaining itln variants is probably the result of a mixed itln population derived from the  <dig> mouse strains.

cd244_se was initially predicted to be a cd <dig> pseudogene due the lack of the terminal exon  <dig>  however, a closer inspection has resulted in the identification of a potential internal splicing site in the predicted exon  <dig>  comparison of all the probable coding sequences derived from this internal splicing site has led to the prediction of a protein which shares 65% identity with the soluble form of rat cd <dig>  <cit> . this novel protein is made up of  <dig> exons which are highly similar  to that of cd244; with part of exon  <dig> spliced to exon  <dig>  on the other hand, it is also interesting to note that the cd <dig> protein sequence of 129s <dig> and celera  are almost identical with 99% sequence identity but they share only 89% sequence identity with that of c57bl/6j .

all the pseudogenes contain exons that share at least 70% sequence identity with their full-length counterparts. none of them contains the full set of exons and multiple stop codons are often spread across them.

southern blot analysis
southern blot analysis  was conducted to experimentally verify both the assembly and the dotplot analysis on the number of duplicated segments. using probes  that hybridised to the 5' and 3' end of the itln genes, fragments gave a banding pattern that was consistent with that predicted from the in silico restriction analysis of the locus. in addition to the 129s <dig> strain, southern blotting was also carried out on c57bl/6j, 129x <dig>  129s <dig>  dba2/j and a/j mice . all the  <dig> substrains also showed a banding pattern that was consistent with restriction fragments predicted from the sequenced 129s <dig> itln locus. dba2/j and a/j strains showed a similar pattern, but with the appearance of a prominent extra band with the 3' probe. although it is highly likely that these four mouse strains share a similar genomic organisation at the itln locus with the 129s <dig> substrains, differences observed in the southern analysis should further warrant a note of care when using the mixed assembly of celera's mouse genome. the c57bl/6j strain consistently gave a single band, as expected.

itln cnvs in mouse
to date,  <dig> genome-wide cnv studies of varying degrees of resolution have been carried out in different mouse strains  <cit> . however, none has specified the exact copy number of the itln genes. recently, the wellcome trust sanger institute has sequenced  <dig> different mouse strains using the illumina next generation sequencing technology. with the knowledge that there are  <dig> itln genes in the 129s <dig> mouse and that it has a similar southern pattern to the other  <dig> substrains, an attempt to identify the itln cnvs in these strains was done by comparing the sequencing coverage across the itln locus . during the mapping of these reads against the c57bl/6j reference genome, reads are expected to collapse together to increase the mapping coverage at segments where copy number gains are located. this gain can be quantified by the log <dig> ratio of the coverage at a particular position; with for example a single  copy gain represented as log <dig> =  <dig> . a locus duplicated once in a homozygous inbred strain would be represented as log <dig> =  <dig>  such a comparison is in fact analogous to cnv detection using the array comparative genomic hybridisation  method  <cit> .

relative to the single itln locus in the c57bl/6j reference mouse, an approximately  <dig> kbp segment containing the itln gene has apparently been duplicated several times in all the  <dig> strains investigated. although the log <dig> ratio of the cast/eij strain falls close to the threshold , the consistently higher than reference coverage across the itln locus  suggests that the segment may actually be duplicated once. the log2ratio for the 129s1/svimj strain vs c57bl/6j varies between  <dig>  and  <dig>  over the itln locus , well above the threshold for calling gene amplication, and suggesting  <dig> to 6-fold gain of the locus compared to c57bl/6j. similar gain is also observed in the other strains .

evidence for expression of mouse itln variants
polymerase chain reaction analysis using common primers which amplified the itln cdna from all mouse tissues sampled, gave a product of the expected size . restriction enzyme analysis  revealed variation in patterns across the different tissue samples, indicating heterogeneity of itln variant expression. pcr products were sequenced to confirm the identities of variants expressed in different tissues . briefly, itln <dig> was expressed in trachea and itln <dig> was the dominant form expressed in small intestinal tissues, whereas itln <dig> was dominant in stomach and caecum. since there was evidence for expression of both itln <dig> and itln <dig> in colon, the pcr product was cloned and  <dig> clone sequences were obtained. twenty six clones were consistent  with itln <dig> and  <dig> were consistent with itln <dig>  the remaining  <dig> sequences contained ambiguities and/or were not consistent with any of the six known itln variants.

summary of the rt-pcr and sequencing of pan-itln pcr products show tissue specific expression of the variants. similar results were obtained with 129s <dig> and 129p <dig> tissues . these results do not preclude the presence of additional itln variants in any tissue.

detection of putative nkx <dig>  transcription factor binding sites in itln promoter regions
in c57bl/6j, the so-called "int5" promoter region of itln <dig>  which we have renamed promoter region  <dig>  to avoid confusion, has been found to harbour the binding site for the transcription factor nkx <dig>   <cit>  at position - <dig> to - <dig>  the cognate dna binding sequence for nkx <dig>  was determined by steadman et al.  <cit>  to be taagt. this pr <dig> promoter region is found to be conserved in itln <dig>  itln <dig>  itln <dig> and itln <dig> of the 129s <dig> mouse . since itln <dig> is predicted to be a truncated protein, it was excluded in the subsequent search for the nkx <dig>  binding site. putative binding sites on the promoter of itln <dig>  itln <dig> and itln <dig> are predicted to be located at positions - <dig> to - <dig>  - <dig> to - <dig>  and - <dig> to - <dig> respectively .

however, the "taagtg" motif is only conserved between the itln <dig> promoter of c57bl/6j and 129s <dig>  a single bp variation results in a "taaatg" binding motif on the promoters of itln <dig> and itln <dig> which may in turn affect the binding affinity for nkx <dig> .

discussion
we present here the sequence of the itln locus on mouse chromosome  <dig> in a non-c57bl/6j mouse strain . multiple duplications of itln and cd <dig> genes/pseudogenes have resulted in the expansion of the locus in comparison to that found in the reference c57bl/6j mouse. nearly half of this expanded itln locus comprises repeat sequence elements. it is likely that the presence of flanking erv and line elements was involved in the duplications and inversion of the itln locus; and that the events may be relatively recent and active  <cit> .

the present data allows us to unequivocally define the genetic architecture of the itln locus in the 129s <dig> genome. it bears considerable similarity to that obtained in the celera mouse genome but with reduced homology over the coding regions. this is most likely due to the celera sequence being a composite of  <dig> different strains and the difficulty in resolving repetitive sequences; and hence not necessarily representative of any one strain. it has been estimated that as much as 57% of highly identical segmental duplications in the mouse genome were potentially misassembled and that segmental duplications/cnvs make up  <dig> - <dig> % of the mouse genome  <cit> . we have overcome this pitfall by a combined strategy of tiling path sequencing of bac clones and southern verification.

furthermore, our southern blot data suggested that other non-c57bl/6j strains also have a similar structure. in support of this, not only have a number of previous genome-wide studies on the structural variations of the mouse genome identified this locus as a hotspot of recombination and cnv, the ensembl annotated itln protein family ensfm <dig> also reports variations in the copy number of the itln gene in different animal species. the majority of the  <dig> mouse strains show evidence of expansion at this locus too, raising the question as to whether the itln locus has been deleted in the c57bl/6j and related strains, or alternatively expanded in a common ancestor to the 129s <dig> and other non-c57bl/6j strains.

it was not known whether cnv at the mouse itln locus confers a simple dosage effect, or alternatively, whether each variant plays a different functional role. we found that in contrast to the c57bl/6j mouse strain, which expresses a single itln <dig> gene  <cit> , 129s <dig> and 129p <dig> mice exhibited site-specific expression of at least three different itln variants along the gastrointestinal tract. such differential tissue expression of itln variants has also been observed in the channel catfish  <cit> . this highly selective expression pattern and the minor amino acid sequence differences between the itln variants suggest that these duplicated genes may be of functional significance at the different sites of expression. it has been suggested that intelectins play a role in modifying mucus properties, and therefore site-selective expression of variants may be important in the same way that mucosal trefoil factor variant expression tends to be co-ordinated with specific mucin types in different regions of the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . similarly, sheep intelectin variants have been found to exhibit site-specific expression differences between airways, gastric stomach  and small intestine  <cit> . however, the consequences to c57bl/6j mice, if any, of lack of expression of itln <dig> and itln <dig> in the gi tract, remain to be established.

it has been shown that a functional nkx <dig>  transcription factor binding site is located in the mouse itln <dig> promoter  <cit> . nkx <dig>  is highly expressed in the prostate, where it is believed to function as a tumour repressor gene  <cit> , and regulates itln <dig> expression in prostate epithelial cells  <cit> . haploinsufficiency in nkx <dig> , where only a single functional allele of the gene is present, was found to result in reduced expression of a range of dosage-sensitive genes in the mouse prostate, including itln <dig>  expression of which was essentially lost in nkx <dig> +/- mice  <cit> . importantly, itln <dig> expression was itself shown to suppress prostate cell growth  <cit> , and thus itln <dig> appears to be an effector of prostate cancer repression. it was of interest therefore to determine the occurrence of nkx <dig>  binding sites in all six itln genes described here. the pr <dig> region which was found to contain the nkx <dig>  binding sequence taagtg  <cit>  was present in the promoter regions of four of the six itln genes but the binding region was mutated to taaatg in all but itln <dig>  suggesting that although itln <dig> probably remains under the transcriptional control of nkx <dig>  in 129s <dig> mice, the same is not necessarily true for the other itln variants.

importantly, an adipocytokine  <cit>  role has been ascribed to human itln <dig> , which can be detected in blood plasma and serum. estimates for normal human serum itln <dig> concentration vary from  <dig> ng/ml  <cit>  to over  <dig> ng/ml  <cit> . recombinant itln <dig> has been shown to stimulate insulin-dependent glucose uptake by adipocytes in vitro  <cit> , and its expression in visceral fat and in the circulation is negatively correlated with body mass index and waist circumference  <cit> . weight loss and aerobic exercise were associated with significant increases in serum itln <dig> levels  <cit>  and a corresponding reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors.

with reference to the comparative metabolic significance of itln expression in mice, orozco et al.  <cit>  investigated the influence of cnv on metabolic traits using a combined genomic - metabolomic approach in the c57bl/6j  and c3h/hej  strains, and in b6xc <dig> h crosses. hotspots of copy number variation in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were associated with metabolic traits, and specifically, cnv in itln <dig>  was linked with weight, triglycerides, adiposity, glucose and insulin level  <cit> . itln mrna expression level, as detected by agilent microarray analysis  <cit> , was significantly elevated in the high copy number genotype , when assayed in adipose, brain and liver tissue. the detailed characterisation of the itln locus described here provides new specific candidates for further investigation of the role of itln genes in mouse models of metabolic disorders.

in addition to itln, the cd <dig> gene sequence is also amplified within the 129s <dig> locus. specifically, this study has identified a putative cd <dig> variant, analogous to the secreted cd <dig> variant previously described in the rat  <cit> . however, we found no evidence of expression of the corresponding transcript by rt-pcr in mouse small intestine , so it is not clear whether it is actively transcribed in this mouse strain. cd <dig>  is a member of the slam family of cell surface receptors, which are present as a gene cluster adjacent to the itln locus on mouse and human chromosome  <dig>  a range of lymphocytes, including natural killer  cells and cd8+ t-cell subsets have been shown to express cd <dig>  which is the high affinity counter-receptor for cd <dig> . while engagement of human nk cell cd <dig> with cd <dig> results in enhanced killing of cd48-expressing cells  <cit> , the situation appears more complex in mice, where both activating and inhibitory roles have been demonstrated  <cit> . it is known that c57bl/6j mice possess a single cd <dig> gene, expressed as long and short splice variants, which are distinct from cd <dig> cdnas amplified from other mouse strains  <cit> . the potential expression of a soluble cd <dig> variant suggested by this study, may introduce an additional level of regulation of lymphocyte interactions in non- c57bl/6j -related strains, and may therefore contribute to immunological differences between c57bl/6j and other strains.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, we have determined the sequence for essentially the complete itln locus in the 129s <dig> mouse, as a prototype for non-c57bl/6j mouse strains. this has elucidated the nature of the copy number variation occurring at this locus, arising from tandem duplication of itln and cd <dig> genes. individual itln genes showed strong tissue expression specificity while most duplicated cd <dig> genes were non-functional.
