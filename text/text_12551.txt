BACKGROUND
fruits are specialized organs that encapsulate seeds. botanically a fruit is the ripened ovary or carpel of a flower. functionally it allows the development of and is a vehicle for the dispersal of seeds. there are different kinds of fruits. fleshy fruit examples are grapes, apples and oranges; dry fruits include cereal grains and nuts. both fleshy and dry fruits have similar regulatory subnetworks and developmental programs  <cit> .

grape berries are formed on flower clusters or inflorescences. grape berry development and ripening involve complex physical and molecular changes  <cit> , including color development, softening, volatile production, acid catabolism, and sugar accumulation. these processes at maturity or peak ripeness produce attractive signals for human, avian and other vectors of seed dispersal. grape berries have many bioactive compounds, like polyphenols and carotenoids with bright colors and aromas that signal their edibility and health-related benefits  <cit> .

grape berry color change and sugar accumulation are common metrics for ripeness. these processes change significantly at veraison, the start of the ripening stage in grapes. sugar accumulation can vary with genotype and environment  <cit> . for example, higher temperatures lead to higher sugar accumulation in the berry at the optimum time of ripeness . many times the winemaker will taste the berries to determine optimum flavor and time to harvest.

nonetheless, sugar accumulation is a wine industry standard for assessing grape maturity. wine grapes are typically harvested between  <dig> and  <dig> °brix. other measures of fruit maturity exist , but the sugar level remains a simple and standard measurement of grape maturity in the wine industry. measurement of sugar levels in grapes is an easy and accurate measurement; all that is needed is a simple refractometer that measures soluble solids , which are essentially made up of glucose and fructose sugars. wine grape berries typically can reach 25% sugar if allowed to ripen fully. higher concentrations can be achieved, but this is often due to dehydration of the berry. a recent paper characterizes in detail the effects of postharvest dehydration in these late stages of berry ripening  <cit> , which are beyond the stages studied in the present study.

sugars affect plant growth and development. sugars provide energy for cellular respiration and transcriptionally signal and regulate gene activity, allowing the fine-tuning of fruit metabolism and development  <cit> . sugar can interact with hormones and the circadian clock to regulate gene expression  <cit> . in addition, sugar can induce senescence  <cit>  and inhibit the expression of photosynthetic genes  <cit> . some of the sugar sensors have been identified in plants  <cit>  including hexose kinase , snf <dig> related protein kinase  <dig>   and target of rapamycin . a glucose phosphate transporter  appears to be an important sugar sensor in the chloroplast  <cit> .

sugars can influence fruit development as well . sugar signaling has been linked to wheat grain development  <cit> . in strawberry, tomato  <cit> , and grape  <cit> , sugar influences the expression of the aba-stress-ripening  gene, a transcription factor, which when it is over-expressed or silenced, accelerates or delays fruit ripening, respectively  <cit> . in grapes, sugars enhance anthocyanin development and the expression of many genes, including the sugar sensor, hkt <dig>  transporter 1)  <cit> .

other factors can affect fruit ripening, such as epigenetic regulation and hormones  <cit> . an investigation of the tomato methylome showed epigenetic control of ripening that was tissue and developmentally specific at the breaker stage  <cit>  when color begins to develop. grape berry development is likely to be under epigenetic regulation as well  <cit> .

hormonal regulation of fruit development is perhaps best studied in tomato  <cit> . a complex interplay of hormones are involved at different stages of fruit development. a number of grape studies indicate that different aspects of ripening are also under hormonal control by auxin, ethylene, abscisic acid and other hormones  <cit> . most of these grape studies were focused on veraison.

a few studies have focused on the late ripening stages of grapes . this stage of development represents a senescence-like phase preparing the fruit for seed dispersal with several degradative processes occurring including chloroplast disintegration  <cit>  and cell death  <cit> . a large number of genes and physiological processes appears to be operating including genes involved with ethylene signaling and flavor pathways  <cit>  in the skin of cabernet sauvignon berries in the late stages of ripening over a range of °brix levels . this present study focuses on a better definition of a core set of late ripening genes by expanding upon our previous findings in cabernet sauvignon. to better understand fruit ripening processes in this stage, four red-skinned and three white-skinned grape cultivars were studied: cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and semillon, respectively. a narrower range of °brix levels was selected to restrict the set of candidate genes involved in berry skins to those genes that are expressed around the optimal sugar levels that flavor maturity develops; berry skins are the primary source of aroma, flavor and color in grapes  <cit> .

transcriptomic and gene network analyses can be used to infer active physiological processes in organisms. to derive and understand complex gene subnetworks  in cells or whole organisms, scientists use gene co-expression network analysis approaches to identify highly connected gene subnetworks with highly enriched gene ontology  categories . wgcna  is one approach that was effectively used to identify highly connected hubs in gene subnetworks for arabidopsis  <cit>  and vitis  <cit> . another approach, petal  <cit> , was developed recently to provide a truly scale-free and small-world network model for large-scale omics analyses. a common set of transcriptional changes occurring in the late ripening stages for all cultivars was identified in this study using a standard  approach of gene mapping to known biochemical pathways and gene network  approaches. these approaches have elucidated multiple transcriptional processes of grape berry ripening at the mature stage and identified top hub genes in these gene subnetworks some of which involve autophagy, photosynthesis, chromosome organization and the circadian clock.

RESULTS
throughout september and october of  <dig>  whole berry clusters were harvested at the valley road nevada agricultural experiment station experimental vineyard. seven grape cultivars were harvested: cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and semillon. individual berry skins were separated immediately from the whole berry and the individual sugar  level of the berries was determined. rna-seq profiling of transcript abundance during the late stages of development was then conducted on berry skins at different sugar levels . prior to signal filtering, there were  <dig>  expressed genes out of  <dig>  annotated genes in the v <dig> reference genome . independent filtering of lowly expressed genes by minimum counts mapped  reduced the count to  <dig>  genes for downstream analysis .

a principal components analysis  was performed  to validate sample uniformity and investigate the degree of separation between cultivar and °brix effects. cultivars were distinctly separated on the 1st principal component explaining  <dig> % of the variance, with red and white cultivars segregating together and away from one another. °brix levels segregated along the 2nd principal component explaining  <dig> % of the variance, in some cases distinctly from one another . the cultivars separated in a similar pattern as in a previous study  <cit> , with pinot noir again segregating between red and white cultivars.fig.  <dig> a pca plot of berry skin samples according to their normalized counts per million. the first  and second  components are represented. samples corresponding to three biological replicates from four °brix levels were analyzed. °brix levels are colored across cultivars. sample abbreviations represent the cultivar, replicate number and brix level, respectively. cultivar abbreviations are cabernet franc , sauvignon blanc , cabernet sauvignon , merlot , pinot noir , chardonnay  and semillon 




while there were many transcripts changing that were different for different cultivars, in this presentation of the results we focus on the common changes in transcript abundance amongst the seven grape cultivars at different °brix levels. we define a common differentially expressed gene  as the gene’s transcript abundance changing significantly in at least one brix comparison of all possible comparisons  and this had to occur for at least one comparison in every cultivar. we identified  <dig> common differentially expressed genes  using a series of contrasts between each °brix level .

in the following analyses, we utilized the degs to conduct a “standard” transcriptomic analysis approach, followed by two different gene co-expression network analysis approaches. in the first approach , gene set enrichment of gene ontologies  was utilized to identify “genes of interest”. they were then mapped to known physiological and biochemical pathways  to gain further insight. in the second approach, we applied two different gene co-expression network analyses, wgcna and petal, to the set of  <dig>  filtered and quality-controlled transcripts  and evaluated some of the gene subnetworks and hubs identified.

standard transcriptomic analysis
gene ontology enrichment analysis
enriched go categories for the  <dig> degs for the common genes of all cultivars  were identified  and were depicted in a go network . the color and size of the circles signify the level of enrichment and the number of genes in each set, respectively. approximately  <dig> go categories were overrepresented after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing . mapping the degs on the cellular overview of the vitiscyc  <cit>  webpage showed that these transcripts were widespread across most biochemical pathways . these results indicated that grape berry ripening in the late stages was broad and complex across many biochemical pathways.

some of the top overrepresented go categories included membrane, regulation of hormone levels, catabolic process and response to abiotic stress. other interesting go categories included developmental process, response to light, response to monosaccharide, nitrogen metabolism, rna processing and chloroplast. many go categories related to flavor development were overrepresented .

of the  <dig> degs, approximately half of the transcripts increased and the other half decreased with increasing °brix level . gene set enrichment was performed for the gene ontologies of the top  <dig> degs that increased and decreased the most  to determine the biological processes involved. the top three enriched go categories  for the increasing degs were nucleic acid metabolism, mcm  complex and chromosome organization . additional interesting categories that were highly enriched were dna methylation and lipid catabolism. the top three go categories  for the decreasing degs were membrane, cell wall and photosystem . other interesting categories included regulation of hormone levels and pigment accumulation.fig.  <dig> a heat map representing the difference in log <dig> expression of the  <dig> degs with different °brix contrasts. individual ratios for the six contrasts were computed for each cultivar and then averaged




examples of three of the top genes with increased and decreased transcript abundance with increasing °brix level include a myb transcription factor, a lob domain protein, a ubiquitinase, an expansin, a bifunctional lipid transfer protein and a pectin lyase .fig.  <dig> the transcript abundance of some of the top degs. data shown are the means ± se; n =  <dig>  error bars not shown are smaller than the symbol. the symbol legend is displayed in the figure




chromosome organization and regulation of transcription
gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that chromosome related events  were significantly modified in the late stages of ripening . chromatin remodeling was recently discovered to be very important in regulating tomato fruit ripening  <cit> . many genes related to chromatin silencing or chromosome organization that negatively regulate gene transcription were associated with increasing °brix. these included histone methyltransferases and a number of sucrose non-fermentable  <dig>  transcripts. snf <dig> domain-containing proteins participate in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription to control development in plants and other organisms  <cit> . for example, the transcript abundance of photoperiod independent early flowering  <dig>  whose protein contains helicase and snf <dig> domains, was increased with °brix level . similarly, the transcript abundance of the transcription factor vviddm <dig>  also peaked at  <dig> °brix. ddm <dig> belongs to the lsh subfamily of snf <dig> domain proteins  <cit> . the transcript abundance of another tf, methyl-cpg-binding domain 9-like  also significantly increased with °brix. and finally, a minichromosome maintenance family protein  increased with increasing °brix.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of some genes involved in chromosome organization. data shown are the means ± se; n =  <dig>  error bars not shown are smaller than the symbol. symbol legend is the same as in fig. 3





regulation of hormone level genes
genes involved in the regulation of hormones were also significantly enriched. the regulation of several different hormone pathways was represented in this group . a protein kinase receptor, hsl <dig>  is one of the most significantly reduced degs with increasing °brix. it interacts with an abscission signaling peptide to inhibit seed maturation  <cit> . its expression is dependent on sugar levels and it also interacts with sugar-inducible and aba-regulated genes  <cit> . a reduction in transcript abundance of vvihsl <dig> may contribute to seed maturation.fig.  <dig> the transcript abundance of some top genes that are involved in the regulation of hormones. data shown are the means ± se; n =  <dig>  error bars not shown are smaller than the symbol. symbol legend is displayed in fig. 3





other genes with decreasing transcript abundance  included non-phototropic hypocotyl  <dig> , auxin response factor  <dig> , and oxophytodienoate-reductase  <dig> . nph <dig> regulates auxin efflux carriers  <cit>  and opr <dig> is involved in jasmonate biosynthesis  <cit> .

light responsive and photosynthetic genes
many blue-light responsive genes, including zeitlupe  and xap <dig> circadian timekeeper  had an increasing response to °brix level. these genes are known to measure day length and adjust the circadian clock. the transcript abundance of a constans-like  <dig> gene  was increased significantly with °brix. constans-like genes were first identified in flowering and are important sensors of day length and light-driven redox signaling  <cit> . constans-like  <dig>  belongs to group iii of co-like tfs  <cit> . almada et al.  <cit>  reported both spatial and temporal expression patterns for the vvicol <dig>  with a reduction of expression in maturing berries, a pattern seen in all cultivars.

nearly all of the transcripts for photosynthetic degs were decreasing with increasing °brix level, such as cytochrome c6a  or light harvesting complex ii type i cab- <dig> . the gene expression of some of these photosystem genes appears to be completely shutting down. only two transcripts associated with photosynthesis were increasing in expression: a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing  protein  and ferritin . these results support the hypothesis that chloroplasts are becoming nonfunctional for photosynthesis or possibly even degraded. chloroplasts are also the location for isoprenoid, carotenoid and terpenoid metabolism, and thus a source of important volatiles and aromas  <cit> .

gene co-expression network analyses
wgcna
wgcna was applied to the entire set of transcripts to systematically and globally identify highly-connected gene subnetworks or module eigengenes , which are the first right-singular vectors of the standardized module expression data. wgcna was also used to identify highly correlated hub genes within these modules. results from the wgcna r package hierarchical clustering function confirmed the pca results that the transcript abundance of all quality-controlled transcripts of the berry samples separated very well according to cultivar and °brix effects . wgcna produces module memberships with highly enriched go categories with important biological meaning  <cit> . wgcna defines modules as clusters of gene nodes with high topological overlap, which means that members of a given module share a greater number of connections with other members of the module than with genes outside the module  <cit> . the gene network had near scale-free topology  with a number of highly connected hub gene nodes. extensive branches  can be observed in the gene dendrogram produced using average linkage hierarchical clustering . utilizing the wgcna r package,  <dig> modules were identified by applying the cuttreedynamic function with a minimum membership of  <dig> genes. modules were merged based on a threshold of  <dig>  . the color grey is reserved for genes not belonging to any module, thus the grey module  does not present a real module.

a module eigengene was calculated for each module and correlated with the berry traits: °brix level, cultivar, red or white grapes . each square in the figure table was colored if it was statistically significant and labeled with two numbers; the upper number is the correlation coefficient and the lower number is the p-value. some modules were significantly correlated with specific traits. here we focus on modules most correlated with the °brix levels. the orangered <dig>  turquoise, antiquewhite <dig> and coral <dig> were the most significantly correlated modules with an increasing gene expression trend with increasing °brix . the darkgrey, navahowhite, darkseagreen <dig> and lavenderblush <dig> modules were the most significantly correlated modules with a decreasing gene expression trend with increasing °brix.fig.  <dig> heatmap correlation of berry traits  of each of  <dig> gene modules. gene modules were identified by a color name  as assigned by the wgcna r package. values in each heatmap block are the correlation  and p-value  of the module eigengene with the berry trait




module membership  was calculated for each gene for each module . a kme value of  <dig> indicates perfect correlation with the module eigengene and the higher the kme of a gene the higher its connectivity within the module. genes with a high kme are considered hub genes. go category enrichment was determined with the top  <dig> genes of each module .

major details of all  <dig> modules were summarized , including the top hub gene and go categories highly enriched in each module. half of the  <dig> modules were significantly correlated with °brix . many of these modules were enriched with many go categories including chloroplast, ribosome, cytoplasm, nucleus, photosynthesis, translation, nucleic acid metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, defense responses, etc.

module eigengenes for all  <dig> modules were correlated with each other to elucidate the relationships between modules . hierarchical clustering revealed a complex network order;  <dig> higher order subnetworks  could be subdivided into what we call “module subnetworks” . the  <dig> module subnetworks were identified with a minimum set of three modules .fig.  <dig> a hierarchical clustering dendrogram and heatmap of module eigengene correlations. the hierarchical clustering dendrogram is overlaid with symbols identifying gene subnetworks. colored blocks at the periphery represent individual modules




the higher order subnetworks, a, b, and c, all were highly enriched in chloroplast, cytoplasm, photosynthesis and translation go categories . they were mostly associated with higher expression in white grape varieties, but there were a significant number of modules that had no differences between red and white grapes.

higher order subnetwork d was enriched in the nucleus, nucleotide binding and gene expression. higher order subnetwork e was not enriched in any particular cellular compartment but was enriched in phenylpropanoid and aromatic compound metabolism go categories. higher order subnetwork f was enriched in the golgi apparatus and transport processes. these latter higher order subnetworks  were mostly associated with higher expression in red grape varieties, but there were a significant number of modules that had no differences between red and white grapes ; these represent common gene subnetworks for all cultivars.

some module subnetworks were large and complex, consisting of  <dig> or  <dig> modules ; they formed a subnetwork within a larger subnetwork. for example, the group  <dig> module subnetwork consisted of modules involved in protein folding, translation, chloroplast and response to light. only  <dig> of the  <dig> modules in this subnetwork were correlated  with increasing °brix, the rest were more correlated with different genotypes .

the group  <dig> module subnetwork consisted of  <dig> modules and was similar to group 3; the module clustering in the module dendrogram indicated that the subnetworks formed into a larger branch or subnetwork. five of the six modules in group  <dig> negatively correlated with increasing °brix. these modules had gene ontologies involving the chloroplast, translation, and photosynthesis and were similar to those in group  <dig> 

in summary, the wgcna network of the grape berry skin at the late ripening stages could be divided into  <dig> higher order subnetworks and  <dig> module subnetworks. these subnetworks were enriched in go categories involving cellular compartmentation  and major metabolic processes . in the next section we will focus on details in the two largest gene modules identified by wgcna that were correlated with °brix levels.

turquoise module had the largest positive correlation with brix
the turquoise module was highly correlated with three other modules: orangered <dig>  antiquewhite <dig> and coral <dig> . these four modules formed the core of the group  <dig> module subnetwork . there were many common go categories amongst these modules including nucleic acid and protein binding . interspersed within the top kmes were many of the core circadian clock genes .

the turquoise module eigengene had the highest significant correlation of  <dig>   with  <dig> °brix. the turquoise module was the largest most connected module with  <dig> transcripts having a  <dig>  kme or higher. transcript abundance in this module increased with °brix level. the response was generally common for all varieties . the top hub was vit_13s0067g <dig>  a pre-mrna-splicing factor  <dig> protein, with a kme of  <dig> . the protein of this gene is required for rna-directed methylation of dna  <cit> .

there were  <dig> go categories overrepresented in the top  <dig> genes in this module . highly enriched go categories of the top  <dig> turquoise module genes included nucleic acid binding , nucleus , mrna metabolic process , and protein binding . other interesting go categories included rna processing, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, post-embryogenic development, response to red or far red light and autophagy.

the top  <dig> genes of this module were highly enriched in specific categories that may be interacting with each other;  <dig> were involved in rna processing,  <dig> were involved in chromosome organization,  <dig> were involved in proteolysis,  <dig> were transcription factors,  <dig> were involved in the circadian clock or circadian rhythm and  <dig> were involved in autophagy . many of these processes are intimately connected to the core circadian clock . these genes represented  <dig> of the total top  <dig> hubs, indicating very high enrichment of these go categories in the top  <dig> genes.

some of these top  <dig> kme genes were involved in more than one category. for example, cbf1-interacting co-repressor cir domain containing protein , enhancer of polycomb-like transcription factor protein , microrchidia  <dig> , rna polymerase ii large subunit , high mobility group  are involved in both rna processing and epigenetic regulation; methyl-cpg-binding domain  <dig>  and ddb1-cul <dig> associated factor  <dig>  are involved in rna processing and protein ubiquitination.

the turquoise module was highly connected to the circadian clock and other light regulated genes; the module contained the largest number of circadian clock and light-regulated genes  in the top  <dig> kmes  than any other module ; it also had  <dig> circadian clock and light-regulated genes in the bottom  <dig> kmes , inferring that these genes may have been negatively regulated or repressed by the same factors that positively regulated the genes within the turquoise module. the light-regulated gene from the turquoise module with the highest kme was cop1-interacting protein  <dig>  . cip <dig> was highly connected in  <dig> similar modules: its hub rank was equal to # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> for turquoise, orangered <dig>  and coral <dig> modules, respectively. cip <dig> is a transcriptional activator that promotes photomorphogenesis  <cit> . it appears to act downstream of most photoreceptors and constitutive photomorphogenic  <dig> . photoreceptors can inhibit cop <dig> and thus activate cip <dig> 

the next highest hub in this group was time for coffee ; it is the circadian clock gene with the highest connectivity. it interacts with lhy  and prr <dig>  in the core circadian clock  <cit> . ztl, also known as adagio protein  <dig> , was the next most connected circadian clock hub gene, having a kme of  <dig>  and had a rank of  <dig> in the module.


elf <dig>  is part of the evening complex  and phytoclock  <dig> ) and appears to be a key regulatory hub for the circadian clock that modulates light signals  <cit> . the gene expression trends for far-red impaired response  <dig>  and other far1-related genes, elf <dig>  ztl, topless , and cop <dig> within our data set were very similar and indicate a possible light signal sensing cascade/cycle involving far <dig> , phyb , ztl, elf <dig>  cop <dig> and tpl.


tpl was another interesting gene from the circadian clock core in this subnetwork of increasing gene expression; it forms a complex with prr <dig> and hda <dig>  a histone deacetylase  <cit>  that positively regulates chromosome compaction. tpl is a broad repressor of many genes and down-regulates the early morning genes as a co-repressor with prr <dig>  which binds to the promoters of the morning genes, cca <dig>  and lhy, inhibiting their expression. increasing tpl shortens the day phase  as in short days. it also interacts directly with emf <dig>  and wrky <dig>  <cit> ; both of these genes were within the top  <dig> kmes of this module. emf <dig>  is part of a polycomb group  complex  and regulates flowering by repressing flowering locus t  expression; it helps to synchronize environmental cues and is a vascular signal.

another top hub, early flowering in short days  is a histone lysine n-methyltransferase required specifically for the trimethylation of h3-k <dig> in flowering locus c  chromatin. it also affects carotenoid biosynthesis genes, and light and carbon responsive genes. efs methylates lhy in arabidopsis  <cit> . other top hub genes were histone ubiquitin ligases  involved in protein processing and post-embryonic development. monoubiquination of histones by hubs stimulates gene expression  <cit> . thus, there is a strong representation of key components of the circadian clock in this gene module.

there were  <dig> autophagy genes in the top  <dig> kmes of the turquoise module: homolog of yeast autophagy 18 g , autophagy  <dig> , autophagy-related  <dig>  and autophagy  <dig> . in particular,  <dig> of the  <dig> are part of the apg <dig> cycling. atg18g  was the most highly connected autophagy hub followed by apg <dig> . autophagy is an important part of the senescence process  <cit> .

darkseagreen <dig> module had the largest negative correlation with °brix
the darkseagreen <dig> module was part of the group  <dig> module subnetwork and thus a part of one of the largest subnetworks elucidated in the late stages of berry ripening. the darkseagreen <dig> module eigengene had a significant correlation of − <dig>   with  <dig> °brix. it was the second largest most connected module with  <dig> transcripts having a  <dig>  kme or higher. the transcript abundance of gene members in this module decreased with increasing °brix level. this decreasing response was generally common for all varieties, but there was higher transcript abundance in white grape skins. the top hub was vit_09s0002g <dig>  a curvature thylakoid <dig> protein , with a kme of  <dig> , a membrane phosphoprotein responsible for curvature at the grana margins  <cit> .

there were  <dig> go categories overrepresented. the top go categories of the top  <dig> kmes were chloroplast , thylakoid , photosynthesis , and cytoplasm . other interesting go categories included isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthetic process, mevalonate-independent pathway, alcohol metabolic process, monosaccharide metabolic process, lipid biosynthesis, and cysteine biosynthesis.

there were  <dig> and  <dig> circadian-related and light regulated genes in the top and bottom  <dig> kmes, respectively. elf <dig>  part of the evening complex, was the top circadian clock gene at # <dig>  another circadian rhythm gene was plastid transcriptionally active  <dig>  at # <dig>  transcription factor tcp domain protein  <dig> , accumulation and replication of chloroplast  <dig> , light-inducible and clock-regulated  <dig> , and regulator of chromosome condensation .

some of the top negatively correlated circadian clock genes included vvielf <dig>  vviztl, vviskip , vvitic , vvirve <dig>  and vvifrs <dig> . these genes were all positively correlated hubs in the turquoise module and indicated a coordinated regulation between the turquoise and darkseagreen <dig> module.

petal analysis
to provide another independent approach for gene co-expression analysis, petal analysis was performed on the same set of  <dig>  filtered and quality-controlled genes. petal constructs models based on seven different spearman correlation thresholds and calculates multiple topological network measures to automatically determine the ‘best’ possible network model for this dataset meeting scale-free and small-world characteristics  <cit> . the final model used for down-stream analysis  is constructed based on a spearman correlation value of  <dig>  and includes  <dig>  of the  <dig>  original genes . here we define hub genes by the top 5% of connected genes within the final network model corresponding to  <dig> genes; their connectivity  ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  all maximal largest cliques within the hub subnetwork were extracted, resulting in  <dig> cliques  with  <dig> genes each. the intersection and union of these largest cliques include  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. the union is a highly intra-connected subnetwork of  <dig> genes with a density of  <dig>   are missing to make a clique).

to build a larger subnetwork, the common immediate neighbors of the  <dig> hub genes were combined into what we define as a hub module; this resulted in a module of  <dig> genes with density of  <dig>  . the genes in this hub module  were also represented in the wgcna turquoise module. both approaches independently identified gene modules with highly connected hub nodes, although wgcna’s turquoise module included more genes, its intra-connectivity was much lower, indicating that the gene expression profiles within the wgcna turquoise module exhibited greater variability compared to petal’s hub module. there was general agreement of the order of hubs in petal with the kme values of the hubs in the turquoise module . a true comparison is difficult, because wgcna’s kme values are local hub measures, whereas petal defines hubs based upon the entire small-world and scale-free network model. thus, we can conclude that the two gene co-expression network approaches consistently identified a list of highly connected hubs in a common network of all grape cultivars of the late stages of grape berry ripening.

integration of wgcna module subnetworks with the circadian clock in berry skins
several other wgcna modules had circadian clock genes in the top  or lower   <dig> kmes. to better understand the role of the circadian clock in fruit ripening, an integrated circadian clock model was constructed relating known circadian clock genes with the grape berry skin gene modules in which they had the highest correlation . the model integrated both blue and red light receptors  as well as genes involved in biochemical processes regulating the clock. these processes included light sensing, proteolysis, alternative splicing and chromatin remodeling. the model depicted a complex interplay of these processes and the large number of gene modules that were affected. lines in the model represent known interactions between genes; red arrows are positive interactions, black lines are negative interactions, and blue lines indicate direct physical interactions but the direction, positive or negative, is unknown. no lines indicate that there are no known interactions at this time.fig.  <dig> an integrated circadian clock model with gene modules of grape berry skins in the late ripening stages. colored symbols indicate genes within that particular module. light sensing, proteolysis, alternative splicing and chromatin remodeling or miscellaneous represent certain regions of the model. red and blue lightning bolts represent the reception of their respective light wavelengths for each gene symbol. lines in the model represent known interactions between genes; red arrows are positive interactions, black lines are negative interactions, and blue lines indicate direct physical interactions but the direction, positive or negative, is unknown. no lines indicate that there are no known interactions at this time




from this model it is hypothesized that light signals  drive the resetting of the clock through the photoreceptors. these in turn affect a series of positive and negative feedback loops in the model.

more subtle associations in the model can be perceived through the module correlations. the two modules participating the most in the clock were the turquoise  and cyan  modules. ztl, frs <dig> and frs <dig> photoreceptors were part of the turquoise module. the cryptochrome  <dig>  photoreceptor was part of the cyan module. there is no direct interaction evidence of these photoreceptors to the core clock components, but their expression was highly correlated with some clock components , elf <dig>  cop <dig>  phye , spa <dig>  indicating some sort of linkage. in other cases, module associations were more obvious. for example, ztl, a blue light photoreceptor, has a number of known interactions with clock components, including the inhibition of toc <dig>  lnk <dig> has direct positive effects on elf <dig> 

at a higher gene subnetwork level, module subnetwork  <dig> was largely represented by circadian clock components in the turquoise, coral <dig>  antiquewhite <dig> and skyblue <dig> modules. again, these modules were enriched in the nucleus, rna splicing, chromosome organization, epigenetic regulation, and ubiquitination. the circadian clock components of the darkseagreen <dig>  cyan, firebrick <dig> and lavenderblush <dig> modules were each part of the module subnetworks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these subnetworks were enriched in the chloroplast and the cytoplasm categories.

thus, this model depicted different genes  within the circadian clock that had direct positive and negative interactions with other genes or proteins in these subnetworks, reflecting the complex interplay of positive and negative feedback loops in the circadian clock. other genes were connected in this clock model through gene module associations, but with no known physical interactions. these genes are new targets for future research on the nature of their interactions within the clock.

discussion
the mature berry skin transcriptome was highly dynamic
this study investigated grape berry skins sampled at four concentrations of total soluble sugars:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> °brix. all of these grapes were grown in the same vineyard and thus exposed to nearly identical environmental conditions. we sampled individual berries from a cluster over a narrow developmental range of increasing sugar in an attempt to reduce variability of our samples. most of the transcriptional changes could be examined with co-expression subnetworks and could be associated with highly enriched go categories. by comparing both red and white grape cultivars in the same vineyard we could identify modules common to all cultivars that were active in the late ripening stages. in the following sections we discuss some of the processes that appear to be involved in the berry skin gene subnetworks during the late stages of ripening.

accumulation of sugar and gene expression
sugar levels appear to play a role in the transcriptional profiles of the berry skin. pca and the hclust function utilized in the wgcna r package showed clear separation by sugar level and a uniformity between samples. these observations were similar to other studies where developmental stages were separated by °brix . grape berries on a cluster can ripen asynchronously with a range of °brix levels  <cit> . the lack of uniformity in sugar concentration can range from  <dig> to  <dig> °brix within a grape cluster  <cit> . indeed, we observed varying °brix within a cluster while separating individual berries from our clusters in this study, which followed a normal distribution within a cluster. ripening related asynchronicity within a cluster has been shown to synchronize in some situations at maturity  <cit> , but this process was not complete in our berries of seven different varieties, where we observed differences in berries on a single cluster of approximately  <dig> °brix .

gene expression in grape berries is affected by the sugar concentration  <cit> . grape berry sugar concentrations increase substantially after veraison, when soluble sugars are actively transported via the phloem while vines are photosynthetically active  <cit> . sugars influence fruit development and gene expression in other plant species . in grapes, sugar can affect cell growth and induce the transcription of some genes in berries  <cit> . sugar increases the expression of a glucose-6-phosphate transporter facilitating sucrose transport for starch conversion in plastids  <cit>  and acts as a sensor for sugar signaling  <cit> . a putative glucose-6-phosphate transporter  had increasing transcript abundance with °brix .

some bzip tfs also contain a sucrose-controlled upstream open-reading frame that exhibits repressed expression under increasing molarities of sugar  <cit> . the promoter sequence of a dihydroflavonol reductase gene  contains a g-box binding domain, myb and sucrose box domains that can be induced by sucrose, glucose and fructose, constituents of a ripening berry  <cit> . sugar regulates other genes involved in sugar transport and anthocyanin biosynthesis in grape berries  <cit> .

thus we confirmed our hypothesis that the transcript abundance of genes would vary with sugar level. this argument is supported by the substantial separation of samples by sugar level in the principal component  <dig> , which was only slightly lower  than principal component  <dig> , which separated by genotype. in addition, there was an enrichment of several go categories for responses to sugar . while harvesting grapes at different times may have contributed to some variability in the samples, separating samples based on their sugar level captured a large part of the variability. it is likely that some changes in gene expression in these berry skins were influenced by the sugar concentration.

autophagy and the decrease of photosynthesis transcripts
many ripening related processes were observed in our data. there was an increase in specific hub genes involved in autophagy. the most highly connected hub for autophagy was the atg18g transcript in the turquoise module . autophagy is a degradative process that involves the formation of autophagosomes  <cit>  and intracellular vesicle transport  <cit> . atg18g, apg <dig>  and atg <dig>  all hubs in the turquoise module, are part of the atg <dig> cycling system, which participates in the formation of autophagosomes  <cit> . there were also a number of proteolysis genes in the top  <dig> hubs of the turquoise module . other senescent-like processes have been observed during grape ripening such as chloroplast disintegration  <cit>  and cell death  <cit> .

ripening also included the continued decrease in transcript abundance of most photosynthetic transcripts that were highly enriched in the darkseagreen <dig> module. this is consistent with the deactivation or degradation of chloroplasts; interestingly, the darkseagreen <dig> module was negatively correlated with the turquoise module indicating that there may be an interaction between the two subnetworks.

most photosynthesis-related transcripts were decreased in late ripening berries. the ripening berry is a sink organ for photosynthate, losing its photosynthetic capacity with time and changing color as chloroplasts are degraded or converted to other plastids with changing carotenoid production  <cit> . in tomato, chloroplasts are converted to chromoplasts, which are the source of the red pigments. in grapes, it appears from two studies that the chloroplasts remain chloroplasts, but that the chloroplasts structure begins to become disorganized with plastoglobules forming and enlarging  <cit> . these plastoglobules may be a source for lipids used in volatile production during the late stages of fruit ripening  <cit> . hardie et al.  <cit>  associated changes in chloroplast structure with the formation of lipid bodies and monoterpenes, which contribute important volatile aromas in maturing grapes. high sugar concentrations can induce senescence  <cit> , repress transcription of the plastome, reduce chloroplast numbers and alter chloroplast morphology  <cit> . perhaps the high sugars in the berries have the same effect?

other ripening processes included cell wall and lipid metabolism. some cell wall softening genes like a polygalacturonase  and a xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase  were positively correlated with °brix levels in the mature berry skins, whereas the transcript abundance of other cell wall proteins were decreased, such as a group of expansins . genes involved in fatty acid and lipid oxidation were also highly enriched in the turquoise module ; the transcript abundance of these genes increased with increasing sugar level.

epigenetic regulation
the turquoise module was highly enriched with genes involved with epigenetic regulation. dna methylation plays an indispensable role in regulating endogenous gene transcription  <cit> . in general, methylation of genes inhibits gene expression or methylation of rna affects alternative splicing. methylation of histones can be permissive for gene expression . acetylation and monoubiquination of histones are also generally associated positively with gene activity. in contrast, histone h2a monoubiquitination  <cit>  and h3k <dig> trimethylation  <cit>  potently repress transcription by the action of the polycomb repressive complexes, prc <dig> and prc <dig> 

regulation of fruit ripening is linked to dna methylation. for example, gradual decreases in methylation of the promoter region of the rin mads-box tf in tomato  <cit>  allows ripening to proceed. differentially expressed methyltransferases, like cmt, drm and met, are transcriptionally active during fruit development in pear  <cit>  and legume  <cit> . these findings indicate a possible role for normal fruit ripening through the regulation of dna methylation, particularly in this class of genes highly conserved in eukaryotic species  <cit> .

methyl-cpg-binding domain  <dig>  in arabidopsis can modulate dna methylation and histone acetylation to regulate both flowering time and shoot branching by specifically binding methylated cpg dinucleotides . atmbd <dig> mutants flower earlier and show abnormal axillary bud outgrowth  <cit> , displaying significantly methylated promoter and intronic regions of the flc gene  <cit> . a common increase in transcript abundance of vvimbd <dig> in all grape cultivars was observed and raises the possibility for methylation of dna and histones .

likewise, ddm <dig> and pie <dig> transcript abundance increased in berries with increasing °brix level in the late ripening stages, peaking at 26° brix. ddm <dig> proteins have been observed co-localizing with mbd proteins forming protein complexes  <cit> . ddm <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit>  is necessary for genomic dna methylation and chromatin remodeling through preferential methylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  instead of transposable elements.

genome-wide reduction of dna methylation results in severe developmental and morphological defects in ddm <dig> mutants  <cit> . in arabidopsis, pie <dig> forms part of the swr1-like complex which deposits a histone variant, h2a.z, onto chromatin around both the transcriptional start and stop sites on genes responsible for flowering repression  and maf <dig> ) enabling their competence for activation by other factors  <cit> . our results support the hypothesis for a role of epigenetic regulation during the late stages of berry development.

light and the core circadian clock
not all degs in the berry appear to be related to the sampled °brix levels, some genes appear to be influenced by the genotype . light may also be having an effect on gene expression. there are at least two publications that provide evidence for a role of light and the circadian clock in grapevine.

in the first, over a thousand genes in two vitis vinifera cultivars were recently observed expressing distinctive circadian rhythms throughout the light-dark cycle  <cit> . for example, vvilhy and vvitoc <dig> did not oscillate, whereas vvirve <dig> and vvielf <dig> of the core clock genes did display a circadian rhythm in grape  <cit> . the authors attribute the differences in clock gene expression to grape maintaining a simplified clock in ripening fruit. furthermore, secondary processes seemed more responsive to circadian oscillation in late ripening stages than primary metabolism, such as the phenolic pathway enzymes: stilbene synthases and phenylalanine ammonia lyase  <cit> .

in the second publication, a genome-wide analysis of the cis-regulatory elements  of grapevine protein-coding gene promoters was performed  <cit> . highly enriched modules or gene networks were identified. there are over  <dig> promoters with a circadian clock-associated cre. the genes with this cre in their promoters are highly enriched in functional categories associated with abiotic stress, hormone, flavonoid, and isoprenoid metabolism. there are a large number of chalcone synthase, stilbene synthase, and terpene synthase genes in this group. the authors suggested that grapevine might have an “expanded clock regulatory network”. in addition, they linked light- and chloroplast-related genes to the subnetwork of the circadian clock gene, vvihyh.

the circadian clock is regulated by light and may have affected gene expression in grape berry skins during the late stages of berry ripening. day length decreased with advanced berry ripening and the progression of autumn.

numerous genes in the core circadian clock were highly connected in gene subnetworks in the late ripening stage. many of the core clock genes displayed similar patterns of expression for all genotypes . as the day length shortened, it appears that the day phase of the clock accelerated or shortened, allowing a greater involvement of the evening complex and its cyclic repression of the morning genes.

the circadian clock is regulated by a number of negative feedback loops and positive regulators  <cit> . its regulation involves a complicated interaction of transcription  <cit> , rna splicing  <cit> , proteolysis  <cit>  and histone modifications  <cit> . light regulates histone modifications, gene expression and higher order chromosome organization  <cit> . genes from all of these processes are present in our circadian clock model .

the circadian clock regulates gene expression throughout the day and night. it regulates the rhythmic variation in photosynthesis, starch accumulation, and starch turnover  <cit> . a well-supported hypothesis is that the circadian clock regulates starch metabolism in the leaf to maintain sugar metabolism throughout the night. the circadian clock in turn is sensitive to photosynthesis and soluble sugar accumulation  <cit> . sugars accelerate the day phase of the circadian clock.

do sugars accelerate the day phase in berries? the role of the circadian clock is well studied in leaves, roots, apical meristems, buds and flowers, but there are few papers on the role of the circadian clock in fruit development.

light signals set the circadian clock  as the day length shortens in autumn. the circadian clock likely received day length signals through far red  and blue light sensors  that trigger changes in gene expression involving rna processing, proteolysis, chromosome modification and organization, and may lead to major changes in berry metabolism .

yet berries develop normally in grapevines grown under constant environmental conditions in the greenhouse  <cit>  or growth chamber  <cit> . elevated co <dig> concentrations substantially accelerate photosynthesis and berry development  <cit> , indicating that sugar accumulation may affect rates of berry development. can changes in day length or the circadian clock alter the rate of berry development and fruit composition as well? to what extent the circadian clock functions in berry development is unclear, but the network analyses results in this study indicate that it was highly connected to major developmental processes and gene modules related to epigenetic regulation and chromosome organization. the interactions of sugar with the circadian clock may be even more complex. the roles and interactions of the circadian clock with sugar accumulation and grape berry development warrants further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
gene expression of berry skins in the late stages of ripening was associated with sugar accumulation and genotype. a common set of genes for all seven cultivars was identified in the late ripening stages of berry development. transcriptional regulation of fruit ripening involved many transcription factors and other regulators of hormone levels. in addition, the transcript abundance of genes related to dna methylation indicated that epigenetic programming might be involved in the regulation of transcription during berry ripening at maturity, suppressing or silencing many genes. gene co-expression analysis was used by two different approaches to elucidate complex transcriptional networks. two of the most highly connected gene subnetworks consisted of hundreds of genes: one subnetwork involved rna processing, chromosome organization, epigenetic regulation, proteolysis and autophagy and the other subnetwork, negatively correlated with the first, involved photosynthesis. thus, there seems to be an interaction between these two subnetworks that links nucleotide metabolism and autophagy with berry skin ripening processes including the large decrease in photosynthetic transcripts. a circadian clock signature for key clock components was also observed to participate in these subnetworks and warrants further study to better understand the role light plays in these subnetworks and the late stages of berry ripening.

the identification of a core set of genes common to all seven cultivars, both red and white wine producing, allowed the identification of key processes in the development of late ripening berry skins, including autophagy, catabolism, nucleotide metabolism, photosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, gene expression and chromosome organization. some of these key processes were associated with specific modules or gene subnetworks and the key hub genes in these subnetworks were ranked for future targeted testing. these transcriptomic results support the hypothesis that senescent-like processes dominate the late stages of berry ripening as the seed matures and prepares for dispersal.
