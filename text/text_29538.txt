BACKGROUND
cryptosporidium spp. inhabit the brush borders of the gastrointestinal and respiratory epithelium of various vertebrates, causing enterocolitis, diarrhea, and cholangiopathy in humans  <cit> . immunocompetent children and adults with cryptosporidiosis usually have a short-term illness accompanied by watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. in immunocompromised persons, however, the infection can be protracted and life-threatening  <cit> . cryptosporidiosis is one of the most important causes of moderate-to-severe diarrhea and diarrhea-associated deaths in children in developing countries  <cit>  and a major cause for waterborne and foodborne outbreaks of human illness in industrialized nations  <cit> . in the united states the number of reported cases of cryptosporidiosis has increased more than twofold since  <dig>  <cit> . currently, it is estimated that there are approximately  <dig>  annual cases of cryptosporidiosis in the united states  <cit> .

among the many established cryptosporidium species and genotypes, c. hominis and c. parvum are the two responsible for greater than 90% of the human cryptosporidiosis cases in most countries. c. hominis is largely human-specific and responsible for anthroponotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis. c. parvum infects both humans and some farm animals, especially pre-weaned calves and lambs and thus can be transmitted both anthroponotically and zoonotically  <cit> . within c. hominis, subtype iba10g <dig> is the dominant strain for c. hominis-associated waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in the united states, europe, and australia  <cit> . the dominant subtype associated with waterborne cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in the united states since  <dig> is a new subtype, iaa28r <dig>  <cit> .

whole genome sequencing of cryptosporidium spp. has greatly facilitated the development of genotyping, subtyping and multilocus sequence typing  tools for characterizing the transmission of c. hominis and c. parvum  <cit> . these tools have played a major role in improving our understanding of cryptosporidiosis epidemiology  <cit> . nevertheless, genomic studies of cryptosporidium spp. lag far behind those on other related apicomplexan parasites largely because of the lack of effective cultivation and animal models. thus far, only the genomes of one laboratory isolate each of c. parvum, c. hominis, and c. muris have been sequenced using traditional sanger sequencing technology  <cit> . more recently, the genome of an anthroponotic ii subtype  of c. parvum serially propagated in immunosuppressed mice has been sequenced using illumina technology  <cit> . the lack of whole genome sequence data, especially from field specimens obtained from outbreaks, has hampered our understanding of genetic determinants for host specificity, virulence, and the biological fitness of various cryptosporidium species and c. parvum and c. hominis subtypes.

in this study, we sequenced the genomes of two dominant outbreak subtypes  of c. hominis by using  <dig> and illumina technologies. prior to sequencing, oocysts were isolated directly from field specimens without propagation in laboratory animals, and extracted dna was amplified to generate enough material for sequencing. results of this study have  filled some gaps in our understanding of cryptosporidium genomics,  identified some major deletions and one large insertion in the c. hominis genome, and  showed the high genetic similarity of the two outbreak subtypes. we have also demonstrated the occurrence of genetic recombination in chromosome  <dig>

most of the  <dig> unmapped contigs from specimen  <dig> were small  and were sequences of multicopy genes  and genes with paralogs in the genome or large repetitive sequences . however, sequences of four contigs  had no similarity to any published sequences, and one contig  had 95% sequence similarity to a 500-bp region of the genome of strentrophomonas maltophilia . similarly, most of the unmapped contigs from specimen  <dig> were small  and were sequences of multicopy genes , genes with paralogs in the genome and large repetitive sequences , and telomeric sequences of cryptosporidium. sequences of  <dig> contigs  had no similarity to any published cryptosporidium sequences, and one contig  had 98-100% sequence similarity to bacteroides fragillis plasmids from humans . similar observations were made for tu <dig>  in addition, the 547 bp at the 5′ end of contig aael <dig>  had 98% sequence similarity to cgd3_ <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  while the remaining part of the sequence mapped to chromosome  <dig>  similarly, the 5′  region of contig aael <dig>  mapped to chromosome  <dig>  the 3′ region  mapped to chromosome  <dig>  while the middle region containing the rrna unit mapped to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

in contrast, most of the unmapped contigs from iaa28r <dig> specimens  <dig> and  <dig> had non-cryptosporidium sequences. for example, the largest  <dig> unmapped contigs  from specimen  <dig> were 99-100% similar to the genome  of the enterobacteria serratia liquefaciens, with the exception of contig  <dig> , which was from its plasmid. as the genome of s. liquefaciens is about  <dig>  mb, the  <dig>  contigs of  <dig> ,231 bp from specimen  <dig> were from the combined c. hominis and s. liquefaciens genomes, with all s. liquefaciens contigs positioned behind the mapped cryptosporidium sequences . evidence of contamination from several bacterial species was present in data from specimen  <dig>  as the  <dig>  contigs totaled  <dig>  mb, which is larger than the combined genomes of c. hominis and one bacterial species. blast analysis of contigs indicated that ~28% of the total nucleotides were from members of enterobacteriaceae and 8% from bacteroidaceae. the  <dig> largest unmapped contigs  had 75-85% sequence similarities to genomes of members  of enterobacteriaceae, except for one , which had a 98% sequence similarity to a  <dig>  bp region of an uncultured organism from the human gut .

sequence similarity to published c. parvum genome and physical characteristic of c. hominis genomes
the genomes of specimens  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and tu <dig> had  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % sequence similarities to the c. parvum iowa genome in the mapped regions, respectively . the alignment of whole genome sequences generated by mauve showed near complete sequence synteny of the four c. hominis genomes to the published c. parvum reference genome, which is the only complete cryptosporidium genome available for comparison. some possible inversions and translocations of sequence fragments were seen in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the two almost fully sequenced c. hominis genomes from specimens  <dig> and  <dig> . however, these inversions and translocations all occurred in sequence gap regions of the reference c. parvum genome. for example, specimens  <dig> and  <dig> generated sequences that cover the sequence gap in chromosome  <dig> of the c. parvum genome and have ~ <dig> -bp extra sequences at the 5′ end of the fragment, with telomeric repeats  . the inversions of sequences in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> also happened around sequence gaps in the c. parvum iowa genome . near the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig>  the large c. hominis contigs in  <dig> and  <dig> that are upstream of the two small scaffolds  in the c. parvum iowa genome both end with telomeric repeats . similarly, the large c. hominis contigs in  <dig> and  <dig> that are upstream of the small scaffold  at the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig> in the c. parvum iowa genome both end with telomeric repeats. in addition, one or two of the genes coded by the c. parvum scaffold  are located at the 5′ end of chromosome  <dig> in c. hominis, which has telomeric repeats at the 5′ end . most of the remaining genes are missing in c. hominis, except for cgd6_ <dig>  whose ortholog is present in c. hominis in an unknown chromosome together with the ortholog of cgd5_ <dig>  although the genome sequences of specimens  <dig> and  <dig> were more fragmented, the same inversion of scaffolds was seen in chromosome  <dig> .figure  <dig> deletion of genes in cryptosporidium hominis genomes in comparison with cryptosporidium parvum. a. deletion of four genes  at the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig>  in c. hominis. b. a major  <dig> -bp deletion in c. hominis genome in chromosome  <dig>  including the cgd8_ <dig> and cgd8_ <dig> genes. note the ~10 kb sequence gap in c. parvum.



most of the missing sequences in the sequenced genomes were in the telomeric regions or low sequence complexity areas of the eight chromosomes of c. parvum, and generally occurred in the two 454-sequenced and the published c. hominis genomes. half of the ten sequence gaps  in the c. parvum genome were missing in the 454-sequenced and the published c. hominis genomes . the two illumina-sequenced genomes, however, fully covered most of the ten sequence gaps in the c. parvum iowa genome . most of the sequences generated from c. hominis specimens  <dig> and  <dig> were longer than the estimated length of sequence gaps in the c. parvum iowa genome, with the noticeable exception of the ~ <dig> -bp sequence gap in c. parvum, which is not present in all five c. hominis genomes . this region was fully covered by contig  <dig> of  <dig>  contig  <dig> of  <dig>  contig  <dig> of  <dig>  contig  <dig> of  <dig>  and contig  <dig>  of tu <dig> . in c. hominis, the ~100 bp sequence downstream of the deletion is almost identical to the beginning sequence of the insert and the immediate sequence downstream of the insert in c. parvum. this might have contributed to the large deletion in the c. hominis genome. the size of the deletion was  <dig>  bp if the sequence gap in c. parvum was indeed  <dig>  bp.table  <dig>

c. parvum- and c. hominis- specific sequences
in addition to the large  <dig> -bp deletion, which contained the c. parvum-specific cgd8_ <dig> and cgd8- <dig> genes and other potential genes in the ~ <dig> -bp sequence gap, the comparative genomic analysis identified several other deletions in the c. hominis genome , including those mentioned above at the 3′ end of chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . most of the c. parvum-specific genes were members of multicopy gene families. thus, cgd5_ <dig>  cgd5_ <dig>  cgd5_ <dig>  cgd5_ <dig>  cgd6_ <dig>  and cgd6_  <dig> in c. parvum are genes of the cryptosporidium telomeric medle family of secreted proteins, all with signal peptides and similar sequences. as mentioned above, these genes are located in tandem in telomeric regions of these two chromosomes, but c. hominis has only one such gene, chro. <dig> or the ortholog of cgd5_ <dig>  likewise, cgd6_ <dig> and cgd6_ <dig> both code for telomeric insulinase-like proteases with signal peptides. members of the insulinase-like proteases all have very different nucleotide sequences, and both c. parvum and c. hominis have  <dig> such genes in tandem near the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig>  thus, c. hominis lacks two of the subtelomeric genes at the 5′ end of chromosome  <dig> as well as five copies of the cryptosporidium telomeric medle family of secreted proteins in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the c. parvum-specific nature of cgd6_ <dig>  was previously known  <cit> .table  <dig>

the comparative genomic analysis further identified several large contigs not found in the published c. parvum iowa genome, including contigs aael <dig>  aael <dig>  and aael <dig> in the published tu <dig> genome. contig aael <dig> is  <dig>  bp in length  and has  <dig> copies of telomeric sequence tttagg at its 3′ end. it mapped to contigs  <dig> and  <dig> of specimen  <dig> and contigs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of specimen  <dig>  and was fully covered by contig  <dig> of specimen  <dig> and contig  <dig> of specimen  <dig>  it codes at nucleotides  <dig> - <dig>  for the hypothetical protein chro.  <dig> with rs/hs repeats at the carboxyl end. the coding region was fully covered in all c. hominis genomes sequenced in this project. sequence alignment indicates that the gene is located at the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig>  with the entire insertion  all ending with copies of the telomere repeat sequence tttagg . as the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig> of c. parvum also had the telomeric repeats, this insertion appears valid. the coding region is not present in c. parvum est library data and five ms/ms peptide libraries deposited in cryptodb . pcr amplification of dna from five c. parvum and c. hominis specimens each confirmed its presence in only c. hominis .figure  <dig>

in contrast, contig aael <dig> is  <dig>  bp in length  and mapped to contig  <dig> of specimen  <dig> and contigs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of specimen  <dig>  it is located in chromosome  <dig> of specimens  <dig>  and  <dig> , and within a sequence gap area in the c. parvum iowa genome. pcr analysis using primers based on the aael <dig> sequence amplified dna of c. hominis, c. parvum, and c. andersoni, with the sequences from c. parvum and c. hominis differing from each other by two nucleotides in the 413-bp region, and from c. andersoni having 97% sequence similarity to nucleotide  <dig> - <dig>  of xm_ <dig>  from c. muris . contig aael <dig>  which contains the sensor histidine kinase gene , was probably not of cryptosporidium origin. it is  <dig>  bp in length had a 66% gc content. it has no equivalents in the published c. parvum and c. muris genomes and c. hominis genomes sequenced in the present study, but has a 77% sequence similarity to the sensor histidine kinase gene of rhizobium etli . pcr primers based on this sequence did not amplify dna of c. parvum or c. hominis .

sequence similarity among sequenced c. hominis genomes and occurrence of genetic recombination
the genomes of the four c. hominis specimens sequenced in this study were similar to each other, except for a subtelomeric region at the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig> and three regions on chromosome  <dig>  this was supported by snp analyses through both mapping of illumina reads to assembled contigs  and direct comparison of sequence alignments of assembled contigs. at the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig> , two types of sequences were seen among the specimens sequenced in this study: one from the two iba10g <dig> specimens  and another from the two iaa28r <dig> specimens . both were very divergent from the sequence in tu <dig> . in contrast, at the three loci in chromosome  <dig>  the sequence polymorphism was biallelic, with each genome showing one of the two types of nucleotide sequences, including the reference c. hominis genome . thus at the 5′ end of the chromosome , all specimens except for specimen  <dig> had sequence identical to the published sequence from tu <dig> . at the gp <dig> locus , specimens  <dig> and  <dig> had the ib type sequence whereas others, including tu <dig> had the ia type sequence. similarly at the 3′ end of the chromosome downstream of chro. <dig> , specimens  <dig> and  <dig> had sequences similar to the published sequence from tu <dig>  whereas specimens  <dig> and  <dig> had a different type of sequence . the breakpoints for the three genetic recombination areas occurred at intergenic regions upstream and downstream of cgd6_ <dig> , upstream of cgd6_ <dig>  and downstream of cgd6_ <dig> , and upstream of cgd6_ <dig>  and downstream of cgd6_ <dig>  for the three regions, respectively. because of the occurrence of genetic recombination, the two iba10g <dig> specimens  sequenced in the study had different types of sequence at the 5′ end of chromosome  <dig> .table  <dig>

intra-specimen sequence diversity at the trinucleotide repeat region of gp60
because of a recent report on intra-specimen genetic heterogeneity seen in illumina sequencing of a pcr-wga product from a c. parvum specimen  <cit> , we examined intra-specimen sequence diversity at the trinucleotide repeat region of the gp <dig> gene in the four c. hominis specimens sequenced in this study. in the specimens sequenced by using  <dig> technology,  <dig> and  <dig> sequence reads mapped to the gp <dig> gene for specimens  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. among them,  <dig> and  <dig> reads had sequences fully covering the entire trinucleotide repeats for the iba10g <dig> and iaa28r <dig> subtypes, respectively. no intra-specimen sequence diversity was seen . similarly,  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequence reads mapped to the gp <dig> gene in specimens  <dig> and  <dig> sequenced by using illumina, respectively. among them,  <dig> and  <dig> reads had sequences fully covering the entire trinucleotide repeats for the iba10g <dig> and iaa28r <dig> subtypes, respectively. no intra-specimen diversity was seen in specimen  <dig>  whereas in  <dig> ,  <dig> reads had  <dig> copies of the tca repeat, one had  <dig> copies of the tca repeat, and one had  <dig> copies of the tca repeat .

discussion
genome similarity between c. hominis and c. parvum, gene deletions, and species-specific genes
results of this study have confirmed the genetic similarity between the almost fully sequenced c. parvum and c. hominis genomes. the genomes of the two species are nearly 97% similar in nucleotide sequences, with complete synteny in gene organization. this is similar to the previous conclusion based on comparison of the fully assembled genome of the c. parvum iowa isolate and the more fragmented genome from the c. hominis tu <dig> isolate  <cit> . some potential genetic rearrangements in several chromosomes were observed in the current study, but they all occurred in the ten sequence gaps and several sequence ambiguity areas in the reference c. parvum genome. as there are no happy maps and genomic libraries with large inserts for c. hominis, the observations on genome organization of c. hominis need to be supported by pacbio sequencing. nevertheless, comparative genomic analysis in this study has identified several major deletions and one insertion in c. hominis, which were overlooked in previous studies probably because of the fragmented nature of the published c. hominis genome. the significance of these gene insertions and deletions  is not clear. because of the high sequence similarity in most genes between c. parvum and c. hominis, these major indels could potentially be responsible for some biological differences between c. parvum and c. hominis.

gene duplication and interallelic recombination could contribute to the gene expansion and losses seen between c. parvum and c. hominis genomes. most of the genes deleted in the c. hominis genome are members of multigene families and have paralogs nearby. thus, of the six medle family of secreted protein genes possibly present in tandem in c. parvum , only one, the ortholog of cgd5_ <dig>  is present in c. hominis. similarly, two genes  that code for insulinase-like are absent in c. hominis. the subtelomeric locations of these genes facilitate the expansion and deletions of multicopy genes by interallelic recombination. sequence homology is probably also involved in the loss of cgd8_ <dig> and cgd8_ <dig> orthologs in chromosome  <dig> of c. hominis, as the ~100 bp region upstream of the fragment containing the two genes and the ~100 bp region downstream of the fragment have almost identical sequences. the sequence homology in two nearby regions could have resulted in the deletion of the two genes in c. hominis during species evolution. as cgd8_ <dig> is a paralog of cgd8_ <dig> and has some sequence similarity to the 5′ end of cgd8_ <dig>  this gene loss in chromosome  <dig> of c. hominis also involves a multigene family. in compact apicomplexan genomes with mostly single copy genes, members of multigene families usually play very important biological functions  <cit> . the function of the medle family of secreted proteins in apicomplexan parasites has not been examined. however, insulinase-like proteases have been shown recently to be rhoptry or microneme-associated in toxoplasma gondii and are probably involved in cell invasion  <cit> . indeed, both cgd6_ <dig> and cgd6_ <dig> have peak expression during the invasion process. the expression of cgd6_ <dig> and cgd6_  <dig> in c. parvum may also be developmentally regulated, as they showed identical expression patterns in in vitro culture  <cit> . as sequence differences in non-coding regulatory elements can also affect the timing or expression levels of invasion-associated proteins, more studies are needed to determine whether the duplications of medle and insulinase genes are indeed the cause of the host expansion of in c. parvum.

compared to the deletion of at least nine genes, c. hominis appears to have only one unique gene that is absent in c. parvum. this gene, chro. <dig>  is located at the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig> instead of the original annotation at the 5′ end of chromosome  <dig> . it codes for a  <dig> aa hypothetical protein that contains rs and hs repeats at the carboxyl end, and has recently been identified as a c. hominis–specific gene, chos- <dig>  by bouzid and colleagues  <cit> . although the function of the protein is not clear, it has been suggested that this protein is a member of a new cryptosporidium-specific protein family that are candidate mediators of host specificity and virulence  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether the c. hominis genome codes for additional species-specific genes in areas of the ten sequence gaps in the c. parvum iowa genome.

sequence similarity among c. hominis genomes and genetic recombination in virulent c. hominis subtypes
as expected, much higher genetic similarity is present among c. hominis genomes. the four c. hominis specimens sequenced in this study had whole genome sequences that are  <dig> - <dig> % similar to the published c. hominis genome from tu <dig>  genes coding for some secreted proteins  and proteases contribute more to the sequence differences than others, suggesting they are under selection and therefore may serve as good targets for the development of diagnostic tools and intervention measures. for example, some of the polymorphic mucin genes such as cgd2_ <dig>  and cgd6_ <dig>  are well known targets of host immune responses  <cit>  and have been used widely in subtyping c. parvum and c. hominis  <cit> . proteases  and protein kinases have been recently shown to play important roles in cell invasion of cryptosporidium and thus have been used as common targets in the development of therapeutic treatments  <cit> .

in contrast to the relatively high nucleotide sequence differences between the genomes sequenced in this study and the published c. hominis tu <dig> genome, the genomes of four specimens from two virulent c. hominis subtypes  in the united states are very similar to each other except for the 3′ end of chromosome  <dig> and three areas in chromosome  <dig>  in particular, chimeric sequences were seen in chromosome  <dig> , indicating the occurrence of genetic recombination in the two subtypes. one of the three areas with genetic recombination is where gp <dig>  is located, a locus widely known for its extremely high sequence diversity and occurrence of genetic recombination  <cit> . recently, population genetic analyses of chromosome  <dig> sequences have shown the exclusive occurrence of genetic recombination in the virulent c. hominis subtypes iba10g <dig> and iaa28r <dig>  especially around gp <dig>  <cit> . it was postulated that the fitness of the two subtypes as a result of genetic recombination was likely responsible for the wide dissemination of iba10g <dig> around the world and the emergence of iaa28r <dig> in the united states. the two iba10g <dig> specimens sequenced in this study also differ from each other at the 5′ end of chromosome  <dig>  especially in the ortholog of cgd6_ <dig>  as a result of genetic recombination. it was previously shown by mlst analysis of chromosome  <dig> that iba10g <dig> specimens from different areas are genetically different  <cit> . although the two iaa28r <dig> specimens sequenced in this study are mostly identical, data from a recent population genetic study of iaa28r <dig> specimend in the united states suggest that there are at least two origins of the subtype  <cit> . therefore, multiple genetic recombination events are probably involved in the evolution of both iba10g <dig> and iaa28r <dig> and are likely responsible for the observed emergence of the same virulent gp <dig> subtypes in different geographical locations in response to selection pressure  <cit> . the occurrence of genetic recombination in virulent c. hominis subtypes also suggests that the widely used gp60-based typing alone is insufficient in molecular epidemiologic characterizations of field specimens, as pointed out previously  <cit> . therefore, the use of mlst and other multilocus subtyping tools can provide new insights into the transmission of cryptosporidium spp.  <cit> . as expected, the three loci in chromosome  <dig> where genetic recombination occurs, cgd6_ <dig>  cgd6_ <dig>  and cgd6_ <dig>  are all highly polymorphic in the present study. the biological functions of proteins coded by cgd6_ <dig> and cgd6_ <dig> thus should be studied.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this comparative genomic analysis has revealed some unique genetic differences between c. parvum and c. hominis and identified some multigene families that can potentially contribute to differences in host specificity of the two closely related species. it has further supported the potential role of genetic recombination in the emergence and evolution of virulent c. hominis subtypes. improvements in knowledge in these two areas are still hampered by the lack of genomic studies of other cryptosporidium species of significant public health and economic importance, the incompleteness of the reference c. parvum and c. hominis genomes, and poor understanding of the functions of the thousands of hypothetical proteins in cryptosporidium genomes and regulatory elements in non-coding areas. with the increased recognition of the importance of cryptosporidiosis in pediatric health in developing countries  <cit> , common occurrence of large waterborne outbreaks in industrialized nations  <cit> , and a major increase in cryptosporidiosis incidence in the united states in recent years  <cit> , more effort should be directed toward studies on functional genomics and the basic biology of cryptosporidium spp.  <cit> .
