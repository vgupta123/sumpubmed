BACKGROUND
the basic function of the lactating mammary gland is to produce milk, providing nutrients for growth and development of the offspring. the main constituents of bovine milk are lactose, proteins, and lipids  <cit> . among these, lactose is the major carbohydrate of milk. it plays a primary role in milk production because it represents the main osmotic constituent in milk and draws water into the mammary epithelial cells  <cit> .

lactose is synthesized from free glucose and uridine diphosphate -galactose. in lactating ruminants, the mammary gland can consume up to 85 % of circulating glucose  <cit> . uridine diphosphate-galactose is also derived from glucose. analysis of lactose synthesis in rodent and bovine models of secretory activation has demonstrated increases in a number of enzyme activities and carbohydrate metabolites that together form the fundamental framework of the lactose synthesis pathway  <cit> . the lactose synthesis reaction is catalyzed by lactose synthase , a complex of β- <dig>  4-galactosyltransferase  and the essential cofactor α-lactalbumin , in the golgi compartment  <cit> . the expression of α-la is very low during pregnancy and increases significantly with parturition  <cit> . beginning in late pregnancy, the β4galt-i level in the mammary gland is estimated to increase about 50-fold in preparation for lactose biosynthesis  <cit> . as the substrate of lactose synthase, the glucose concentration in the lactating mammary epithelial cells is higher than usual  <cit> . generally, animal nutrition has a substantial effect on milk composition  <cit> . glucose is a dietary factor that affects milk synthesis  <cit> , but whether glucose supplementation can affect lactose synthesis in dairy cow mammary gland is not well understood.

lactose synthesis and secretion by the mammary gland involve the expression of a large number of genes  <cit> . however, few studies have focused on the effects of glucose supplementation on the expression of genes involved in lactose biosynthesis. the protein kinase b  is a critical downstream effector in multiple signal transduction pathways and regulates cellular proliferation, survival, and metabolism  <cit> . among the members of the akt family, only akt <dig> is upregulated in the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation  <cit> . knockout studies have demonstrated that akt <dig> has roles in the functional differentiation of the secretory epithelium and in metabolic pathways that regulate milk synthesis  <cit> . loss of akt <dig> results in failure of the coordinated metabolic responses required for the establishment of lactation at parturition, including increased glucose uptake and lipid synthesis, which in turn results in decreased milk production  <cit> . the lactation defect observed in akt1–/– mice is thus due to a metabolic defect that results from a failure to upregulate glucose transporter  <dig>  and other akt1-specific target genes  <cit> . it is unknown whether glucose supplementation modulation of lactose synthesis could be related to akt <dig> expression in dairy cow mammary gland.

in this study, we hypothesized glucose supplementation could affect lactose synthesis in lactating mammary gland of dairy cow. additionally, glucose induced lactose synthesis is related to akt <dig> expression in lactating cow mammary epithelial cells. to meet these objectives, we evaluated the effects of different concentrations of glucose on mammary epithelial cell survival, proliferation, and lactose synthesis. the expression of genes known to be involved in glucose transportation and lactose synthesis was examined by quantitative real-time pcr  and western blot when cells were cultured with dmem containing 12 mm glucose. to evaluate if glucose modulates lactose synthesis via akt <dig> activation, sirna-mediated knockdown of akt <dig> in cultured mammary epithelia cells was performed.

RESULTS
effect of glucose on lactose synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells
glucose is the primary precursor of lactose in lactating mammary glands. in animal and human models, plasma glucose gives rise to the vast majority of the monosaccharides of lactose  <cit> . to investigate if glucose supplementation has the ability to induce lactose synthesis in lactating dairy cow mammary gland, we generated mammary epithelial cells from mid-lactating mammary tissues of dairy cows . immunofluorescence staining of cytokeratin  <dig> was observed in the cytoplasm , indicating that the cells we cultured were purified mammary epithelial cells  <cit> .fig.  <dig> glucose induces dairy cow mammary epithelial cell growth and lactose synthesis. a mammary epithelial cells isolated from mid-lactating mammary tissues of dairy cows were acquired using a phase-contrast light microscopy with a leica l 40 ×  <dig>  ph <dig> objective. b immunofluorescence staining for cytokeratin  <dig> in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells was acquired using a confocal microscopy with a leica hcx pl apo cs 40 ×  <dig>  oil objective. cytokeratin  <dig> was stained with fitc , and nuclei were stained with propidium iodide . for a and b, scale bar, 75 μm. c, d the effect of glucose on cell viability  and proliferation  in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. e lactose secretion from dairy cow mammary epithelial cells cultured with or without glucose. lactose content in medium was measured with the lactose/d-glucose  assay kit . for c, d, and e, mammary epithelial cells were cultured in dmem with high glucose  or without glucose  for 24 h. data are shown as the mean ± sem from  <dig> independent replicates. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> 



to detect the effects of glucose on mammary epithelial cell survival, proliferation, and lactose biosynthesis, mammary epithelial cells were cultured in dmem with or without glucose for 24 h. cell viability  and proliferation  were both markedly increased in mammary epithelial cells cultured with high glucose compared with those in glucose-free medium . we also measured the lactose secreted from mammary epithelial cells into the medium. the amount of lactose in medium collected from cells cultured with high glucose for 24 h was significantly higher than that from glucose free-cultured cells . these data suggested that glucose induced mammary epithelial cell growth and lactose biosynthesis.

next, we measured the effects of different concentrations of glucose on lactose synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. mammary epithelial cells were cultured in dmem with glucose at concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 20 mm. the effects of glucose concentration on cell viability and proliferation were examined after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h of treatment. cell viability and proliferation both increased for the first 24 h, followed by a decrease . however, the viability and proliferation of only those cells cultured with 12 mm glucose were upregulated significantly, peaking at 24 h, compared with the other glucose concentration groups . the lactose content in the medium increased for the first 24 h, followed by a plateau when cells were cultured with  <dig>   <dig>  and 16 mm glucose. similarly, lactose content reached highest in the medium when cells were cultured with 12 mm glucose for the first 24 h . as a result, a concentration of 12 mm glucose was determined to be the optimum concentration to induce lactose synthesis in cultured dairy cow mammary epithelial cells.fig.  <dig> the effect of glucose concentration on cell growth and lactose synthesis. a, b the effect of glucose concentration on cell viability  and proliferation  in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. c the effect of glucose concentration on lactose synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. dairy cow mammary epithelial cells were cultured in dmem with glucose at concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 20 mm. the effects of glucose concentration on cell viability, proliferation, and lactose content were examined after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h of treatment. data are shown as the mean ± sem from  <dig> independent replicates. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig>  versus corresponding value for cells cultured in dmem with 0 mm glucose



effect of glucose on expression of genes involved in lactose synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells
in lactating mammary gland, lactose synthase catalyzes the conversion of glucose and udp-galactose to lactose in the golgi  <cit> . glucose is passed across the plasma membrane and golgi membrane into the golgi lumen by gluts  <cit> . uridine diphosphate-galactose is actively transported into the golgi lumen by solute carrier family  <dig> member a <dig>  and solute carrier family  <dig> member b <dig>   <cit> . to explore the molecular process by which glucose induces lactose synthesis, we first examined the expression of glut <dig>  glut <dig>  glut <dig>  glut <dig>  slc35a <dig>  and slc35b <dig>  which mediate glucose and udp-galactose transportation in mammary gland . as shown in fig. 3a, glut <dig>  slc35a <dig>  and slc35b <dig> mrna levels were significantly increased in mammary epithelial cells cultured in dmem with 12 mm glucose for 24 h , whereas glut <dig>  glut <dig>  and glut <dig> mrna levels did not change compared to the control. next, we examined the expression of hexokinase  <dig> , α-la, β4galt-i, and akt <dig>  which are involved in catalyzing and regulating lactose biosynthesis in lactating mammary gland  <cit> . the results showed that hk <dig>  β4galt-i, and akt <dig> mrna levels were significantly increased in mammary epithelial cells cultured in dmem with 12 mm glucose for 24 h , whereas expression of α-la remained relatively unchanged .fig.  <dig> effect of glucose on expression of genes involved in lactose synthesis. a quantitative real-time pcr analysis of the mrnas encoding glucose and udp-galactose transporters, including glucose transporter  <dig> , glucose transporter  <dig> , glucose transporter  <dig> , glucose transporter  <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig> member a <dig> , and solute carrier family  <dig> member b <dig> . b quantitative real-time pcr analysis of the mrnas encoding key enzymes and regulators in the lactose synthesis pathway, including hexokinase- <dig> , α-lactalbumin , β- <dig> -galactosyltransferase  <dig> , and protein kinase b alpha . for a and b, total rna was isolated from dairy cow mammary epithelial cells treated with or without 12 mm glucose for 24 h. the mrna levels were measured by qpcr and normalized to β-actin mrna. c, d western blot analysis  and quantification  of proteins involved in lactose synthesis. e, f western blot analysis  and quantification  of akt <dig> and pakt <dig>  for c and e, protein lysates from dairy cow mammary epithelial cells treated with or without 12 mm glucose for 24 h were collected for western blot analysis. data are shown as the mean ± sem from  <dig> independent replicates. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ns, no statistical significance



on the basis of the mrna expression data, we analyzed protein expression of glut <dig>  slc35a <dig>  slc35b <dig>  hk <dig>  β4galt-i, akt <dig>  and pakt <dig> in mammary epithelial cells by western blot. compared with the control, the levels of glut <dig>  slc35a <dig>  and slc35b <dig> were significantly increased  in mammary epithelial cells cultured in dmem with 12 mm glucose for 24 h. consistent with this, hk <dig> and β4galt-i levels were also increased  . protein kinase b alpha and its active form, pakt <dig>  were also upregulated in mammary epithelial cells cultured in dmem with 12 mm glucose compared with the control . overall, these results strongly suggested that glucose induced lactose synthesis in mammary epithelial cells by upregulating glut <dig>  slc35a <dig>  slc35b <dig>  hk <dig>  β4galt-i, and akt <dig> 

relationship between akt <dig> and glucose modulation of lactose synthesis in dairy cow mammary gland
next we examined the regulatory mechanism underlying the effects of glucose on lactose synthesis. protein kinase b alpha has a critical role in the proliferation, survival, and metabolism of numerous cell types  <cit> . the above findings demonstrated that akt <dig> and pakt <dig> expression were both upregulated by glucose in vitro cow mammary epithelial cells. to determine whether glucose modulates lactose synthesis via akt <dig> activation in dairy cow mammary gland, sirna-mediated knockdown of akt <dig> in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells was performed, followed by measurement of akt <dig> mrna and protein 48 h later. the expression of akt <dig> mrna was suppressed significantly by transfection with akt <dig> sirna  but not by the scrambled sirna . consistent with the qpcr results, knockdown of akt <dig> in mammary epithelial cells also led to substantially lower levels of akt <dig> .fig.  <dig> glucose modulates cell growth and lactose synthesis via akt <dig> activation. nonspecific scrambled sirna  was used as a negative control in all experiments. a relative akt <dig> mrna levels in sirna-transfected dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. the mrna levels were measured by qpcr and normalized to β-actin mrna. b, c western blot analysis  and quantification  of akt <dig> in sirna-transfected dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. the protein levels were normalized to β-actin. d, e, f the effect of glucose concentration on lactose synthesis , cell viability , and proliferation  in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells when cells were transiently transfected with akt <dig> sirna. sirna-transfected dairy cow mammary epithelial cells were cultured in dmem with glucose at concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 20 mm for 24 h. the effect of glucose concentration on lactose content, cell viability, and proliferation were examined. data are shown as the mean ± sem from  <dig> independent replicates. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> 



we then investigated the effect of akt <dig> knockdown on lactose synthesis in mammary epithelial cells and measured lactose production under both basal  and stimulated  conditions. compared with the control, akt <dig> knockdown decreased lactose synthesis in both basal and glucose-stimulated conditions. the effect at 0 mm  was not significant, and the inhibition effect was significant at 8 mm and 12 mm glucose . we further examined the effect of akt <dig> knockdown on cell viability and proliferation when cells were cultured in medium with different concentrations of glucose . compared with the control, cell viability and proliferation were both significantly decreased when akt <dig> was knocked down . however, cell viability and proliferation were increased by treatment with 12 mm glucose compared to other glucose concentrations when akt <dig> was knocked down.

we next examined whether akt <dig> knockdown in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells cultured in medium with 12 mm glucose downregulated the expression of a glucose transporter and genes encoding enzymes involved in lactose synthesis. quantitative real-time pcr analysis showed that the mrna levels of glut <dig>  hk <dig>  and β4galt-i in akt <dig> knockdown mammary epithelial cells were significantly reduced , whereas the expression of α-la remained relatively unchanged . consistent with these qpcr results, knockdown of akt <dig> in mammary epithelial cells also led to significantly lower levels of glut <dig>  hk <dig>  and β4galt-i, as well as slc35a <dig> and slc35b <dig> . overall, these data strongly support the hypothesis that glucose modulation of lactose synthesis is related to akt <dig> expression in dairy cow mammary gland.fig.  <dig> protein kinase b knockdown decreased the expression of genes involved glucose transportation and lactose synthesis. nonspecific scrambled sirna  was used as a negative control in all experiments. a relative mrna levels of glucose transporter  <dig> , hexokinase- <dig> , β- <dig> -galactosyltransferase  <dig> , and α-lactalbumin  in sirna-transfected dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. sirna-transfected dairy cow mammary epithelial cells were cultured in dmem with 12 mm glucose for 24 h. cells were collected and the total rna was isolated for gene expression analysis. the mrna levels were measured by qpcr and normalized to β-actin mrna. b, c western blot analysis  and quantification  of protein expression levels of glut <dig>  solute carrier family  <dig> member a <dig> , solute carrier family  <dig> member b <dig> , hk <dig>  and β4galt-i in sirna-transfected dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. sirna-transfected dairy cow mammary epithelial cells were cultured in dmem with 12 mm glucose for 24 h. cells were collected for western blot analysis, and the protein levels were normalized to β-actin. data are shown as the mean ± sem from  <dig> independent replicates. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> 



discussion
lactose synthesis is related to milk volume. glucose is the primary precursor of lactose. once taken up by the lactating mammary epithelial cell, glucose is either used in the synthesis of lactose or processed by glycolysis to provide energy  <cit> . compared with non-lactating dairy cows, lactating dairy cows have an approximately 4-fold higher requirement for glucose  <cit> . because lactating dairy cows need more glucose than non-lactating dairy cows, one might reasonably expect that glucose availability could affect lactose synthesis in lactating dairy cow mammary gland. in this study, we observed that glucose increased lactose synthesis in cultured dairy cow mammary epithelial cells, as well as cell viability and proliferation. a concentration of 12 mm glucose was the optimum concentration to induce lactose synthesis in cultured dairy cow mammary epithelial cells within 24 h. protein kinase b alpha was activated by glucose in lactose synthesis process. glucose transporter  <dig>  slc35a <dig>  slc35b <dig>  hk <dig>  and β4galt-i expression were also increased as a result of akt <dig> signaling in dairy cow mammary gland.

in mammals, glucose transport across the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells is carried out by glucose transporters  <cit> . in the current research, we examined the expression of glut <dig>  glut <dig>  glut <dig>  and glut <dig>  which has been previously reported in mammary gland . glucose induced significant increases in glut <dig> mrna and protein levels in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells but did not affect glut <dig>  glut <dig>  and glut <dig> mrna, suggesting that glut <dig> is one of the glucose transporters induced by glucose in dairy cow mammary gland for lactose synthesis. glucose transporter  <dig> is abundantly expressed in bovine mammary gland and increases during pregnancy and lactation  <cit> . our result is in agreement with a report that glut <dig> is the main extracellular and intercellular  glucose transporter in mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . in mouse and dairy goat mammary epithelial cells, glut <dig> is mainly distributed along the plasma membrane and golgi apparatus  <cit> . the presence of glut <dig> on the golgi membrane appears to be specific to mammary epithelial cells, as most cells do not have this glucose transporter on the golgi membrane  <cit> .

in rat and mouse mammary glands, glut <dig> expression markedly decreases during pregnancy and practically disappears during lactation  <cit> . this is because glut <dig> is mainly located in the adipose compartment, not in the plasma membrane  <cit> . in bovine mammary gland, the expression of glut <dig> increases 10-fold from prepartum to postpartum, and fairly strong glut <dig> staining is observed at both the apical and basolateral membrane of lactating bovine mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . but our results showed that glut <dig> expression in cells cultured with 12 mm glucose did not changed compared to the control , which is consistent with the report that glut <dig> mrna is not affected by various concentration of glucose in cultured bovine mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . although glut <dig> is detected in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells during lactation in rats, forced weaning results in decreased cytoplasmic glut <dig> staining intensity but no change in glut <dig> staining  <cit> . our data, along with previous evidence, demonstrate that glut <dig> is the main glucose transporter in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells for lactose synthesis, and its levels are regulated by glucose.

the synthesis of lactose takes place in the golgi compartment of mammary epithelial cells. lactose synthesis paralleled the induction of expression of proteins involved in udp-galactose synthesis and its transport across the golgi membrane. the initial step in the synthesis of udp-galactose is phosphorylation of glucose by hk. bovine mammary epithelial cells grown in higher glucose concentrations have higher hk activity  <cit> . in rodents, hk <dig> is expressed in the mammary gland throughout pregnancy and lactation, whereas hk <dig> is expressed only following parturition  <cit> . in the current study, we detected hk <dig> mrna and protein expression in cultured dairy cow mammary epithelial cells, and this expression was upregulated when cells were treated with 12 mm glucose for 24 h. these expression data are positively correlated with lactose synthesis, indicating that hk <dig> expression was affected by glucose during lactation. glucose has the ability to induce hk <dig> expression in mammary epithelial cells, but various concentrations of glucose do not elevate hk <dig> mrna expression levels  <cit> . uridine diphosphate-galactose is actively transported into the golgi lumen by slc35a <dig> and slc35b <dig>  we found that the levels of slc35a <dig> and slc35b <dig> were markedly increased in mammary epithelial cells treated with 12 mm glucose for 24 h. similarly, the expression of slc35a <dig> and slc35b <dig> strongly correlated with lactose concentration.

in the golgi compartment, the biosynthesis of lactose involves the combination of free glucose and udp-galactose, which is catalyzed by the lactose synthase system. this enzyme complex is composed of β4galt-i and α-la  <cit> . β- <dig>  4-galactosyltransferase is a constitutively expressed, trans-golgi resident type ii membrane-bound glycoprotein  <cit> . in mammals, β4galt-i is required for the tissue-specific production of lactose, which takes place exclusively in the lactating mammary gland. α-lactalbumin is a noncatalytic mammalian protein expressed de novo exclusively in the mammary gland during lactation  <cit> . the physiological function of α-la is to lower the glucose km of β4galt-i so that it may be used maximally for the synthesis of lactose and it changes the specificity of β4galt-i from n-acetylglucosamine to glucose  <cit> . mice with a null mutation of the α-la gene fail to lactate  <cit> . in this study, we found that β4galt-i levels were upregulated in the presence of additional glucose, but the expression of α-la in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells was not affected by glucose. this result is in agreement with the previous report that elevated level of glucose increases β4galt-i expression, but not α-la in bovine mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . our data, along with previous evidence, indicate that glucose supplementation may stimulate lactose synthesis partly by altering the expression of β4galt-i, but not α-la.

in this study, we also demonstrate that glucose modulation of lactose synthesis is likely related to akt <dig> in lactating mammary glands of dairy cows. protein kinase b alpha serves as a potent survival factor for secretory epithelial cells  <cit> . protein kinase b alpha is upregulated in the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation, and knockout studies have demonstrated that this particular serine-threonine protein kinase plays a role in the functional differentiation of the secretory epithelium and in metabolic pathways that regulate milk synthesis  <cit> . in our experiments, akt <dig> knockdown decreased both basal and glucose-stimulated lactose synthesis, as well as cell viability and proliferation, indicating that akt <dig> is required for lactose synthesis in response to glucose.

the protein kinase b family stimulates transport and metabolism of glucose  <cit> . in hematopoietic cell line, akt <dig> activation increases the localization of glut <dig> to the cell surface and maintenance of hk function  <cit> . in mammary gland, previous studies have shown that mice lacking akt <dig> exhibit a pronounced metabolic defect during late pregnancy and lactation that results from a failure to upregulate glut <dig>  <cit> . our data showed that knockdown of akt <dig> in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells decreased both the mrna and protein expression of glut <dig> in response to glucose. these data, along with previous evidence, demonstrate that akt <dig> is required for upregulation of glucose uptake in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. consistent with a role in upregulation of glut <dig>  akt <dig> knockdown also resulted in deceased expression of slc35a <dig> and slc35b <dig>  as well as hk <dig> and β4galt-i, in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells.

CONCLUSIONS
glucose supplementation has the ability to induce lactose synthesis in in-vitro bovine mammary epithelial cells. glucose modulation of lactose synthesis is related to akt <dig> activation in lactating mammary glands of dairy cows. additionally, glut <dig>  slc35a <dig>  slc35b <dig>  hk <dig>  and β4galt-i expression were increased as a result of akt <dig> signaling in dairy cow mammary gland.
