BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rna molecules that are approximately  <dig> nucleotides  in length, which negatively regulate specific target genes by mrna degradation or translational repression. the role of mirna was first reported in caenorhabditis elegans, where aberrant expression of lin- <dig> caused abnormal cell division and proliferation, affecting the timing of cell division and development in larvae  <cit> . several developmental and physiological processes including stem cell differentiation, hematopoiesis, cardiac and skeletal muscle development, neurogenesis, insulin secretion, cholesterol metabolism and immune response have been shown to be regulated by mirnas  <cit> . the expression of most mirnas has a spatio-temporal pattern, suggesting that they play specific functions in a variety of processes. recently, several studies have explored mirnas as molecular biomarkers for use in identifying biological pathways, aiding cancer diagnoses, and identifying disease activity and treatment effects  <cit> .

the bovine mammary gland  is a complex organ that grows and develops after calf birth  <cit> . the complex initiation of mg lactation has been extensively studied over the years at the genetic, physiological and morphological levels because of its important functions  <cit> . it has been reported that many genes are expressed differently to maintain lactation  <cit> . however, only a few studies have assessed the potential implication of mirnas in mg lactogenesis. numerous mirnas have been found to be involved in the regulation of milk protein expression and mg differentiation, and computational and experimental methods have been exploited to identify mirnas in cattle  <cit> . however, studies on the regulation of mirna expression profiles in bovine mg during lactation are still in their infancy. there are currently  <dig> bovine mirnas deposited in mirbase  <dig>   <cit> , with only a few found in the mg  <cit> . therefore, identifying mg mirna expression profiles is an important approach to explore the mechanism of lactation initiation and to identify biomarkers for lactogenesis.

to obtain mirna expression profiles and to compare the difference in mirna expression between periods of lactation and non-lactation, we used next-generation sequencing technology to sequence two mirna libraries constructed from tissue samples taken during these two periods. using computational prediction, potential targets for these mirnas were identified, leading to the construction of an interaction network related to lactation. our integrative analysis highlights the complexity of gene expression networks regulated by mirnas in mg during lactation.

RESULTS
determination of bovine mg period
hematoxylin-eosin staining  and immunofluorescence  were employed to verify the microstructure differences of the lactating and non-lactating mg tissues used in constructing mirna libraries. in the lactation mg , many mature alveolar structures were packed with mammary lobules of a variety of shapes. mature alveolar lumens were large in appearance and filled with secretions, with little connective tissue between alveoli. additionally, large amounts of α-casein were found surrounding the nuclei and in the large alveolus. in contrast, an increase in stromal, connective and fatty tissue was observed in the non-lactating mg . in addition, most of the ductal lumens were either comparatively smaller than in the lactating mg or collapsed, with a few residual ductal forming clusters of epithelial cells. small amounts of α-casein were detected around the tissues.

furthermore, mrna expression of αs1-casein, a major milk protein, was measured using real-time pcr. as expected, αs1-casein mrna was highly expressed during the lactation period and had barely detectable expression during the non-lactation period .

analysis of sequencing data
two mirna libraries were constructed using small rna isolated from bovine mg and sequenced using genome analyzer. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained from the lactation and non-lactation period libraries, respectively . the ratio of lactation/non-lactation was  <dig> %, indicating that the two libraries were well represented.

after filtering low-quality reads and adaptor sequences,  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from the lactation library and  <dig> , <dig> from the non-lactation library . certain rna reference sequences including mrna, rrna, trna, snrna, snorna and rfam were filtered from the raw reads. the detection of a low proportion of long rnas, such as mrna , rrna , trna  and snorna  , indicated that our samples were not contaminated by degraded rna. finally,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads from lactation and non-lactation libraries, respectively, were used for subsequent analysis . length distribution analysis revealed that more than half of these clean reads  were  <dig> nt in length , consistent with the typical size range of small rna generated by dicer. this analysis indicated that the clean reads included a large proportion of mirna sequences.

all clean reads were then aligned against the bta genome and mammalian mirbase using the acgt-mir program. this process detected  <dig> pre-mirnas encoding  <dig> mirnas, of which  <dig> were unique sequences, while  <dig>  were expressed in both periods. the unique mirnas were categorized into three groups based on their hits:  <dig> mirnas matched with known bta mirnas registered in the mirbase database;  <dig> mirnas were conserved among other mammals but have yet to be identified in bovines; and  <dig> mirnas were mapped to the bta genome, with the extended genome sequences having the potential to form hairpins.

features of the three mirna categories in bovine mammary glands
the  <dig> unique sequences from  <dig> known mirnas corresponding to  <dig> bta pre-mirnas only accounted for  <dig> %  of the sequences deposited in mirbase  . reads of these known mirnas accounted for  <dig> %  of the total clean reads . these results indicated that while known, highly abundant bta mirnas were easily detected, there are novel mirnas in the mg that have yet to be isolated. the known mirnas had a broad range of expression levels in the mg, ranging from hundreds of thousands of sequence reads for the most abundant mirnas to single reads for the least abundant . the two libraries had  <dig>  of the known mirnas in common, indicating that most of the known mirnas were shared during mg development.

the sequences were also mapped to other mammalian genomes. in this study, the  <dig> mirnas prefixed with “pc” corresponding to  <dig> unique mirna sequences were classified as conserved . our results showed that  <dig> genomic cognates were predicted to be homologous mirnas, of which  <dig> were cognates in mus musculus,  <dig> in homo sapiens,  <dig> in canis familiaris and  <dig> in rattus norvegicus . in general, the bovine mirna population is more conserved in mus musculus than in homo sapiens.

the  <dig> mirnas representing  <dig> unique mirna sequences comprising the third group were termed as novel bovine mirnas and prefixed with “cn” because they mapped to the bta genome without homology to any known mammalian mirnas, and the corresponding extended genome sequences are capable of forming hairpins . this mirnas in this group accounted for a large proportion of the total expressed unique mirnas  and were novel mirnas in cattle. in this unique “cn” series of mirnas,  <dig>  novel bovine mirnas were detected in both libraries, while the remaining mirnas were expressed in a lactation period-specific manner. unsurprisingly, the reads of novel bovine mirnas were less abundant than those of known mirnas. only  <dig> and  <dig> novel bovine mirnas produced more than  <dig>  reads in the lactation and non-lactation libraries, respectively.

a custom-designed microarray assay was performed to validate these mirna expressions in the mg of lactation and non-lactation dairy cows. after removing mirnas that had less than  <dig> reads  from the original  <dig> unique mirnas, the remaining  <dig> mirnas  were fabricated on the microarray. only  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas were identified by the microarray, including  <dig> of the known mirnas,  <dig> of the conserved mirnas and  <dig> of the novel mirnas .

identification of differential expression patterns of mirna in bovine mg
the main aim of this study was to identify mirnas that may play regulatory roles in bovine mg by comparing their expression patterns in lactation and non-lactation periods. we examined the co-expression of unique mirnas in the two libraries representing these two periods . analysis of the sequencing results demonstrated that more than 60% of reads overlapped between lactation and non-lactation periods, in which  <dig> mirnas were known,  <dig> mirnas were conserved and  <dig> were novel. the ideg package was then used to identify differentially expressed mirnas on the basis of potentially significant changes in expression. the expressions of  <dig> mirnas were significantly different between lactation and non-lactation periods . among these,  <dig> unique mirnas were expressed in both periods, while  <dig> mirnas  were only highly expressed in the lactation period and  <dig> mirnas  were only highly expressed in the non-lactation period. microarrays were performed to confirm these  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas. the expression patterns of  <dig> of these mirnas  were consistent with the deep sequencing data . this finding indicates that deep sequencing is slightly more sensitive and reliable for the identification of differentially expressed mirnas than microarray analysis.

characteristics of chromosomal locations of pre-mirnas in bovine mammary glands
the chromosomal positions  of all  <dig> pre-mirnas detected in this experiment, including novel mirnas, were searched by blast. it was determined that  <dig> of the pre-mirnas  matched with the bta genome and that  <dig> mature mirnas of pre-mirna hairpins were located at more than two genomic loci on different chromosomes .

the genomic density distribution of bovine pre-mirnas, i.e., the number of pre-mirnas per mbp of individual chromosome, was analyzed . densities were calculated by dividing the number of pre-mirnas by the number of nucleotides on the individual chromosome. the shortest chromosome  and the longest chromosome  encode  <dig> and  <dig> pre-mirnas, respectively, corresponding to  <dig>  and  <dig>  pre-mirnas per  <dig> mbp genomic sequence. chromosome  <dig> encodes  <dig> pre-mirnas, the most pre-mirnas of all the chromosomes, corresponding to  <dig>  pre-mirnas per  <dig> mbp genomic sequence. the coefficients of variation  are 72% in this study and  <dig> % as reported in mirbase  <cit> , indicating a consistent genomic density distribution .

in gene studies, genes are clustered to identify co-expressed genes from the same primary transcript or to identify gene clusters that share similar functions. we followed the criteria proposed by mirbase and defined  <dig> kbp as the maximum inter-distance for two pre-mirnas to be considered as clustered. there were  <dig> pre-mirnas grouped into  <dig> clusters, accounting for only  <dig> %  of the total pre-mirnas .

we predicted all of our mature mirnas of pre-mirna hairpins using unafold software and found that  <dig> pairs of known mirnas and novel candidates share the same pre-mirna structure and that their pre-mirnas’ chromosomal locations were identical . the two mature sequences were located in different arms of one pre-mirna, including  <dig> known mirnas located at the 3’ end and  <dig> known mirnas at the 5’ end. we also found that reads of sequences were heavily biased towards the arm containing known mirnas. for example, mir-26b-5p and pc-468-3p share the same hairpin structure and are located on different sides of chromosome  <dig>  ; the reads of each sequence for mir-26b-5p and pc-468-3p were  <dig>  and  <dig> in the lactation period and  <dig>  and  <dig> in the non-lactation period, respectively. it is possible that these lower-read novel candidates may be new mirnas revealed by the highly sensitive deep sequencing approach.

prediction of mirna targets and lactation networks in bovine mg
the  <dig> known bovine mirnas detected were grouped into families with unique seed sequences  to identify putative targets. more than  <dig>  annotated mrna transcripts were selected as potential targets, equivalent to approximately  <dig> targets per mirna. all targets were then processed by gene ontology annotation analysis. it was found that these targets have a wide range of diverse functions, with over half involved in transcriptional activity .

based on the results of target prediction, mirnas and target gene interactions were integrated using egan to construct possible regulatory networks to investigate the relationship between mirnas and lactation . we chose lactation as the gene ontology central process to show all entrez gene neighbors and then imported  <dig> known mirnas to find possible relationships. the resulting network includes  <dig> mirnas detected by this study and  <dig> expressed target genes relating to lactation. for example, mir- <dig>  reported to have a role in lactation, has five predicted targets related to lactation, including slc35b <dig>  cabp <dig>  gpr, mapkap and prlr. of these predicted targets, mir- <dig> is known to inhibit prlr protein translation by regulating stat <dig> and mapk, thereby suppressing the proliferation and viability of mouse mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . in this study, mir- <dig> was expressed more highly during lactation than during non-lactation, as detected by deep sequencing. prolactin, which acts through its receptor, is a key factor in lactogenesis and lactation maintenance  <cit> . prlr causes ductal outgrowth and side branching when grafted into prlr−/− epithelium  <cit> .

regulation of lactation genes by mirnas
two genes and six mirnas in the network were selected to validate its reliability. our data collection and analysis revealed that the 3’utr of signal transducers and activators of transcription  mrna contains a complementary site for the seed region of bta-mir- <dig>  while the 3’utr of hexokinases  was paired with five mirnas: bta-mir- <dig>  bta-mir-199a, bta-mir-125b, bta-mir-181a and bta-mir- <dig> . these findings highlight the fact that our network is able to propose possible interactions between mirnas and genes that have yet to be determined experimentally.

real-time pcr analysis was performed to analyze the expression levels of mir- <dig>  mir-125b, mir-181a, mir-199b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in mg tissues. mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were readily detectable in both periods but were expressed at obviously lower levels in the lactation period than in the non-lactation period. in marked contrast, significant reductions in the expression of mir-125b, mir-181a and mir-199b were observed in the non-lactation period . expression of hk <dig> and stat <dig> mrna was found to be higher in the non-lactation period than in the lactation period .

the significant differences in the expressions of mirnas and their targets between the two periods prompted us to explore the possible biological significance. we investigated the possible roles of these differentially expressed mirnas in the regulation of gene expression using a cell-based model. mir- <dig> mimic, mir- <dig> inhibitor, mir- <dig> mimic, mir-199a mimic, mir- <dig> mimic and mir- <dig> mimic were individually transfected into mac-t cells.

mir- <dig> mimics target and downregulate stat <dig>  while mir- <dig> inhibitors may increase stat <dig> protein levels by antagonizing the effect of mir- <dig>  therefore, it is conceivable that mir- <dig> could be involved in regulating stat <dig> gene function during lactation .

mir-125b, mir-181a, mir-199b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> can regulate expression of the hk <dig> gene according to our network. to examine the effects of these  <dig> mirnas on hk <dig> expression, mac-t cells were transfected with mirna mimics or negative control dsrna. hk <dig> protein levels were evaluated by western blotting. transfection with mir-181a, mir-199b and mir-125b mimics did not significantly change the protein level of hk <dig> , while mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> mimics markedly inhibited the production of hk <dig> protein. taken together with the fact that no significant differences were observed at the transcriptional level by real-time pcr , these results suggest that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> may function at the translational level.

discussion
although the involvement of mirnas in human mg has been extensively studied, no systematic work has been conducted on bovine mg. some bovine mirnas have been recently identified by computational and direct cloning approaches  <cit> , but most bovine mg mirnas have not been identified or functionally studied. in this study, an extensive mirna profile of lactation and non-lactation bovine mg was created. two small rna libraries generated a total of  <dig> m sequencing reads, from which  <dig> m reads of mappable sequences  were derived. in total,  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were detected in bovine mgs. a custom-designed microarray assay was performed to confirm these sequenced mirnas. seventy-four novel mirnas and  <dig> conserved mirnas were detected using this microarray. we propose that these confirmed mirnas are novel mirna candidates in bovine mg.

differentially expressed mirnas in bovine mgs
the comparison of mirna expression between lactation and non-lactation mg allowed us to identify  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> conserved bovine mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas that were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups. although there is no direct evidence showing the relationships between these mirnas and mg development, it has been reported that the overexpression of mir- <dig> can lead to decreased rates of cell division with cell cycle arrest  <cit>  and is related to the metabolism of cellular lipids. milk lipid synthesis in mg is increased during the lactation period. the processes that take place between lactation and non-lactation resemble an epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition . the loss of inter-epithelial cell-cell contacts, including loss of the cell adhesion molecule e-cadherin, takes place between the two periods  <cit> . graziano martello and colleagues showed that mir- <dig> induces emt in breast cancer cells  <cit> . taking these observations together suggests that mir- <dig> could play important roles in lactation. it has been reported that mir-23b represses duct gene expression by down-regulating transforming growth factor-beta  signaling  <cit> . our data showed that the growth of the ductal system became active and mir-23b showed opposite expression patterns in the lactation and non-lactation periods. therefore, we propose that mir-23b may be involved in mg duct system development.

mirna location and structure
there is evidence that mirnas are often clustered and sometimes co-expressed from the same primary transcript, leading to the hypothesis that they may share functional relationships  <cit> . mirnas clustered on genome loci are ubiquitous in animals. characteristics of mirna clusters have already been reported for many mammals  <cit> . based on the consensus criteria, our results reveal a unique feature. the low percentage of clustering seen in our data may be due to the currently incompletely characterized bovine genome. each cluster contained  <dig> to  <dig> pre-mirnas. the chromosome with the most clusters is chromosome  <dig>  with  <dig> clusters. some mirna clusters contain different types of pre-mirna, such as cluster  <dig>  housing mir- <dig>  cn- <dig> and pc- <dig> within chromosome  <dig> . these three pre-mirnas may act cooperatively.

our most interesting finding is that there were  <dig> pairs of known mirnas and novel candidates with the same pre-mirna structures but very different counts. one potential reason for this finding is that the highly sensitive deep sequence technology makes it possible to identify novel candidates with lower counts. another possible explanation is that the pre-mirna hairpin can be cleaved into two arms. one arm is the mature mirna, which is loaded with argonaute  proteins into the rna-induced silencing complex , where it guides the risc to silence target mrnas, whereas the other arm goes on to be degraded via the mirna processing canonical pathway. because mature mirna is derived from different pre-mirnas depending on the body’s needs, the amount of the degraded arm will vary under different physical conditions.

lactation network
mirnas exert their effects by interacting with target mrnas. therefore, target-predicting software  was used to identify putative targets. on the basis of the predicted targets of the  <dig> known mirnas, an interaction network composed of these mirnas and their candidate targets expressed during lactation was constructed by egan. using this network, it was demonstrated that  <dig> mirnas interact with a total of  <dig> targets, which are involved in amino acid, fatty acid and lactose metabolism. it has been reported that the increased activity of the xanthine dehydrogenase  gene, a putative target of mir- <dig>  mir-15b and mir- <dig>  is an early event in mammogenesis in vivo and in vitro rather than a terminal component of differentiation  <cit> . mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> target bcat <dig> encodes a branched chain aminotransferase found in mitochondria. it has recently been observed that branched chain amino acids can play a signaling role for protein synthesis in addition to serving as substrates  <cit> . in a study designed to determine the effect of lactation, it was found that bcat activity increased in mammary tissue during rat lactation and was 6-fold higher than in virgin rats  <cit> . prlr is the putative target of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-374b, mir-30a and mir-27b and plays a function in mg development together with prolactin. prolactin promotes alveolar survival, maintains tight junctions and regulates milk protein and lactose synthesis  <cit> . stat <dig> serves as a common point in the signal transduction pathways of several lactogenic and galactopoietic hormones in the mg  <cit> . feuermann and colleagues found that one of the targets of stat <dig> is the mir-17/ <dig> cluster  <cit> . gene knockout experiments have demonstrated that the formation of lobular-alveolar structures depends upon the actions of progesterone and prolactin receptors functioning through the stat <dig>  cyclin d <dig> and wnt pathways. molecular analyses have established that caveolin- <dig>  abrogates prl-induced gene expression by sequestering jak <dig>  the loss of both cav- <dig> alleles results in precocious mg development during pregnancy and the concomitant precocious activation of stat <dig>  all of the above indicate that although little is known about the exact functions of these mirnas, the relationships with their respective target genes indicate potential roles in lactation.

both hk <dig> and stat <dig> are key genes in the constructed network. five related mirnas were used to validate the network. stat <dig> expression patterns were opposite to those of mir- <dig> in the mg detected in this study. according to our target predictions, we found that the stat <dig> 3’utr is paired to mir- <dig> by a 7-mer seed region. our transfection assay using mac-t cells revealed that increased levels of mir- <dig> could reduce stat <dig> protein expression. these findings emphasize a potential role of mir- <dig> in lactation regulation.

the interaction network predicted that hk <dig> is a target of mir-125b, mir-181a, mir-199b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  currently, there are no reports on any associations between hk <dig> and mirnas. although  <dig> mirna binding sites were predicted in the hk <dig> 3’utr, only mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> at high concentrations resulted in significant reductions in hk <dig> protein level. it is possible that the network is regulated by other factors or that the three mirna binding sites are located at the position of the hk <dig> 3’utr  <cit> . the results of this analysis indicated mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as putative mirna regulators of hk <dig>  therefore, in this study, we have identified a relatively large number of mirnas from bovine mg, validated  <dig> newly isolated mirnas , analyzed their expression and predicted their putative targets. our results also demonstrated that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  characterized by the mirna-gene regulatory networks, are probably essential for lactation via the targeting of stat <dig> and hk <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of our work was to examine mirna expression profiles in bovine mg and to evaluate mirna functions through the identification of differentially expressed mirnas in lactation and non-lactation mg. our identification of novel mirnas highlights the importance of mirnas with low abundance and less conservation between species. an interaction network of known mirnas and their target genes relating to lactation was constructed to postulate the functional roles of mirnas in the mg. this integrated analysis provides important information that may inspire further experimental investigation into the field of mirnas and their targets during lactation.
