BACKGROUND
endothelial cells  are frequently thought to be homogenous because of the multiple functions they share independent of the organ they serve, such as providing a non-thrombogenic surface, regulation of production or inhibition of vasoactive substances, haemostasis as well as leukocyte recruitment. yet on closer examination, they show significant heterogeneity between similar vessels in different organ systems or in arterial versus venous endothelia . although known as highly specialized cells since the description of their fenestrated phenotype by f. jorgensen more than 40 years ago  <cit>  glomerular endothelial characteristics remain largely undefined.

global gene expression studies added large amounts of valuable information to our knowledge on various ec and related pathologies, e.g. atherosclerosis  <cit> . yet, in the case of human glomerular microvascular endothelial cells  developments did not have comparable pace. due to challenges in obtaining, culturing and maintaining hgmec studies employing primary cells in human glomerular research have been scarce, but very useful in obtaining new insights of human glomerular endothelium; most recently amaral et al. investigated how shiga toxin type- <dig> and subtilase cytotoxin lead to damages characteristic for haemolytic uremic syndrome  <cit> . the ultimate aim to experiment with non-cultured glomerular ec has never been attained and the very first human glomerular endothelial cell line  was not presented until  <dig>  <cit> . this cell line has proved to be a useful tool in kidney research. recently, glomerular endothelial barrier function and its regulation were finally studied in great detail using this tool while previously filtration barrier function research has mostly been on podocytes and the contribution of the glomerular endothelium had been relatively neglected  <cit> . these studies showed how reactive oxygen species present in common pathologies such as diabetes cause glomerular injury by directly disrupting glycocalyx and how chondroitin sulphate controlled by vascular growth factors a and c contributes to glomerular endothelial glycocalyx modulating the protein passage  <cit> . nevertheless, despite its usefulness in endothelial research an immortalized cell line is not suitable to define the cellular transcriptome with its predominant and specific transcripts. thus, we hypothesized that such an investigation using genetically unmodified hgmec would enhance our understanding regarding the source of the unique morphological characteristics, the behaviour in both culture and in disease and prepare the grounds for further studies of hgmec. we used serial analysis of gene expression , because it provides an unbiased approach to gene discovery and enables quantitative acquisition of most transcripts expressed  <cit> . secondly, sage has become a powerful tool due to creation of large datasets holding more than two hundred million tags from a wide spectrum of tissues or cells including different ec which are publicly available as part of the cancer genome anatomy project  <cit> .

the goals of this study were to establish extensive transcriptomic data as a step towards identification of the transcripts controlling the distinctive morphological and functional characteristics of glomerular endothelium and to underline endothelial diversity by comparisons between sage libraries from glomerular endothelial and uncultured glomeruli or from other non-glomerular ec. to reach these goals based on the known challenge in receiving useful data out of large transcript lists we describe a research strategy powerful enough to first confirm the endothelial origin of the transcript lists by bioinformatics, then to identify a low abundant transcript, neurogranin  for the first time in glomerular endothelium using an in-silico analysis and finally to verify its expression in vitro and in vivo by means of sequencing and immunohistochemistry.

verification of endothelial origin of hgmec sage library
the library was confirmed to be of endothelial origin with a classification approach as explained in detail in the methods section. in short, we used the sum of the relative expression of  <dig> tags  as a test statistic: a value larger than the threshold  <dig>  indicates an endothelial origin. in other words, if the sum of the total copy numbers of these tags account for  <dig> % or more, that library qualifies as endothelial. with a sum of  <dig>   for these  <dig> tags our hgmec sage library is clearly classified to be of endothelial origin . notably, two of the analyzed  <dig> endothelial cell sage libraries, “vascular_endothelium_normal_breast_associated_p1h12 + _ap_1”  and “normal corneal endothelium” , scored below the threshold of  <dig> . consequently, although this might be the reflection of a significant endothelial heterogeneity, only the remaining  <dig> endothelial cell sage libraries were merged to build a non-glomerular endothelial reference sage library for further analyses.figure  <dig>

overlap analysis and mapping
after verification of the endothelial origin of this library, we took advantage of the existing public data  to reduce the high number of tags to a small group of relevant and differentially expressed tags in hgmec. the algorithm we used as the research strategy is depicted in figure  <dig>  first, we determined overlapping transcripts from both the hgmec sage library and the ex vivo glomerular library containing  <dig>  tags  <cit> . this showed that  <dig> transcripts were shared by the cultured hgmec and the non-cultured glomeruli that contain ec. this group represented transcripts in our hgmec sage library with the potential of in vivo expression. out of these  <dig> transcripts   <dig> were differentially overexpressed in hgmec using chi-square test with p <  <dig>  in comparison to the non-glomerular endothelial reference sage library  and with the restriction that the observed count in hgmec is higher than statistically expected . to test whether our statistical analysis settings were adequate we applied multiple test correction to all p-values of the above described  <dig> transcripts by means of “false discovery rate ”. this p-value cut-off only included tags with a false discovery rate of <  <dig>   and was thus expected to result in less than 5% false positives. surprisingly, this procedure led to the detection of five additional overexpressed transcripts and therefore was less stringent than our previous p-value cut-off of  <dig>  with no correction . adding these transcripts to the set of overexpressed transcripts did not have an influence on our data or their interpretation. nevertheless, we added the fdr corrected p-values to table  <dig>  additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig> figure  <dig>

gene ontology  analysis
we identified the go terms present in the  <dig> overexpressed genes by mapping them to the go biological process and determining whether they occur more often in a category than expected. we defined a category to be redundant if its child term contained the same genes. among the  <dig> detected categories  <dig> redundant child terms were deleted. the remaining most significant categories resulted in five connected components in the gene ontology graph that are listed in table  <dig>  the known interplay between different ubiquitination processes and apoptosis in different biological systems such as tnf receptor signaling  <cit>  is reflected in hgmec by the overexpression of many go terms from these biological processes. ubiquinol to cytochrome c  and nuclear migration  are not displayed in table  <dig> despite their significant overexpression due to the small numbers of molecules in the go-terms mitochondrial electron transport. nonetheless, in the case of “nuclear migration”  both of the molecules in this cluster were overexpressed in hgmec and also in the regulatory microtubule associated molecule tpx <dig>  <cit> . this is not a high abundance molecule and yet it was clearly detected in our hgmec sage library . our go analysis demonstrates that hgmec have high expression of ribosomal proteins . also, molecules involved in interspecies interactions and cytoskeleton organization are enriched in hgmec. one of two other molecules of interest in the glomerular endothelium, the von willebrand cleaving protease adamts <dig> , tag caggctgaaa, was not detected in hgmec or in any other endothelial sage library except in the endothelium of the normal colon . on the other hand caveolin- <dig> involved in endo- and transcytosis  <cit>  . interestingly, the pathway analysis in hgmec and dermal human microvascular ec  sage libraries revealed novel differences regarding caveolae between these two microvascular endothelial cell types. in caveolae pathway caveolin- <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> were all present in hgmec and absent in dermal microvascular ec. a complete list of molecules from this pathway present in hgmec and absent in dermal microvascular ec is shown in additional file 7: table s <dig> table  <dig>

glomerular and non-glomerular endothelial expression of neurogranin
to identify transcripts with the highest potential to be novel and hgmec pre-dominant we applied the final group of transcripts of interest containing  <dig> tags  to a set of additional criteria: a) completely absent in all other nephron regions ex vivo
 <cit>  and b) more highly expressed than statistically expected in hgmec. ultimately, one transcript fulfilled all these criteria, namely nrgn. its expression in hgmec equalled to 192% of the statistically expected expression and it was enriched in hgmec when compared to ex vivo glomerulus or to the fusion endothelial reference library with  <dig> versus  <dig> copies or  <dig> versus  <dig> copies per  <dig>  tags, respectively. it was on position  <dig> when sorted from highest to the lowest expression level in the group of  <dig> tags . the corresponding tag for nrgn is tgactgtgct. based on the sagegenie algorithm from boon et al.  <cit>  this tag has a high ranking of 95% and is classified as a reliable 3’ end of nrgn refseq transcripts  and , which strongly supported the validity of the tag. neurogranin transcript expression in genc under non-permissive conditions  was shown by quantitative rt-pcr and the 116 bp long product was cloned, sequenced and matched the nrgn refseq transcript , 237 bp, 100% . to confirm the expression of nrgn in the glomerular ec in vivo, frozen sections of human kidney were co-immunostained for nrgn  and the ec marker vwf . as shown in figure 6e, both proteins show a significant co-localization confirming the transcriptional data that nrgn is expressed in the kidney’s glomerular ec. no reactivity was observed with secondary antibodies alone . the endothelial expression of nrgn is further corroborated by the in silico analysis using each of the  <dig> publicly available endothelial libraries considered for the reference endothelial library. we found that  <dig> of them expressed the nrgn tag to some extent , with a mean number of nrgn tags per  <dig>  of  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

the last two libraries in italic were not included in the non-glomerular endothelial reference sage library based on their failure to be clearly classified of endothelial origin according to our verification analysis as explained in methods.

nrgn: neurogranin.

two of the four libraries which did not contain the nrgn tag, were the ones which were below the “endothelial” threshold  and thus not included into the fusion endothelial reference library. the other two were “vascular normal_cs_control” from dermal microvascular ec and “vascular_endothelium_normal_liver_associated_ap_nlec1”. according to these data treatment of dermal microvascular ec with vascular growth factor  known as a differentiation factor for ec  <cit>  led to a detectable expression of nrgn, as shown in the “vascular normal_cs_vegf+” library .

discussion
human glomerular endothelium is composed of highly specialized cells. their molecular features leading to the unique phenotype remain largely unknown. in this study we define the transcriptome of hgmec using sage  <cit> . serial analysis of gene expression gives exceptionally unbiased transcriptional data because it is based on extraction of unique sequence tags for each distinct transcript, known or unknown, differentially expressed or not, from a population of transcripts. the frequency with which a given tag is present in a sage library reflects the abundance of its transcript resulting in quantification of obtained data. thus, it does not involve error prone statistics resulting from comparison to laboratory controls and thus its data are readily comparable among different laboratories. moreover, it obtains a broader snapshot of gene expression when compared to the commercial arrays  <cit> . these clearly distinguish sage from other methods used for similar purposes. also, in endothelial cell research sage has proven to be both reliable and successful . it has to be noted that more recent and advanced high throughput sequencing methods such as deep rna sequencing were considered for this study. this particular method displays similarities to sage regarding the linearity over a wide range of transcripts from low to high abundance as well as some technical advantages. it can work with significantly less starting material at a higher speed, with less work-load and cost for large sets of raw data from a single experiment to detect novel splice variants or alternative transcription sites  <cit> . yet, sage was the method of choice when designing the study due to the combination of its validity and the availability of unprecedented, large, well-maintained datasets and quality-controlled databases from sage libraries .

the main challenges of transcriptional studies remain a) the sequencing errors, which was reported to account for approximately 10% of tags in sage  <cit> , b) the validation of detected transcripts, c) managing the vast number of transcripts and d) not “overseeing” novel transcripts of interest which are present, but not easily “visible” in the transcript library. in this study, these issues were addressed by incorporation of advanced bioinformatics and conventional methods such as real-time pcr and immunohistochemistry. our bioinformatics strategy allowed verification of endothelial origin of the hgmec as well as  <dig> out of the  <dig> sage libraries which were publicly available at the time . the failure of two established endothelial sage libraries to qualify as endothelial using our methodology deserves to be mentioned. although many possible explanations can be given for this phenomenon, we suggest that this is based on the significant differences between endothelia accounting for endothelial diversity. nevertheless, we chose not to incorporate the transcript tags from these libraries into the non-glomerular endothelial reference library, although according to our calculations this would not change any statement or conclusion of this study. furthermore, exclusion of singletons and comparison of hgmec sage library first with ex vivo glomerular then with  <dig> endothelial sage libraries were fundamental. only hgmec-enriched tags with a significant overlap between hgmec and ex vivo glomeruli under the simultaneous exclusion of common transcripts with non-glomerular endothelial cells were used for analyses, thus the probability of chasing tags based on sequencing errors was further minimized. thus, expression of all the  <dig> randomly chosen transcripts in the resulting list of overexpressed hgmec transcripts could be verified by qrt-pcr. finally, robustness of our strategy was additionally validated by the demonstration of nrgn, a low-abundant molecule previously thought to be brain specific, in human glomerular endothelium in vitro and in vivo for the first time. interestingly, although this transcript had never been known in kidney or any endothelial cell, our analysis showed that it was present in some previously generated endothelial sage libraries but was never recognized due to a lack of a strategy such as the one described in this study. the results from this stepwise procedure provide valuable large lists of transcripts expressed in human glomerular endothelium which have a high potential to be present in vivo and underline endothelial diversity.

moreover, a genetic analysis of glomerular ec is especially intriguing: not only because their uniqueness is evident in their morphology, behaviour in culture, and disease , but also because it is postulated that they have a distinct embryological origin and that the developing kidney generates its own endothelium  <cit> . because the origin of distinct hgmec features in vitro or in vivo is not fully understood, we defined the transcriptome of human glomerular endothelium by means of sage using hgmec in culture which carried typical characteristics of differentiated glomerular endothelium including fenestrations and particularly focused on transcripts which are common to hgmec and non-cultured ex vivo glomeruli. only those transcripts were exposed to further analysis regarding their presence or absence in a fusion endothelial reference library. thus, the vast numbers of transcripts were gradually reduced to manageable numbers and to relevant lists which are presented here. next, these lists were explored in increasing depth. at first glance the remarkable abundance of ribosomal proteins in the hgmec sage library was evident by the presence of  <dig> different ribosomal proteins among the most abundant  <dig> tags. we argue that this is not a mere consequence of cell culture and is a pattern found in other sage libraries from non-cultured cells, e.g. human monocytes   <cit> . high translational activity possessed by hgmec was reflected by the overexpression of “translation and energy metabolism” go cluster. according to the go analysis another cluster which was more abundant than statistically expected in hgmec was “ubiquitination”. ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification of proteins. monoubiquitination is involved in various processes e.g. in endocytosis or transcriptional regulation. in contrast, polyubiquitination of a protein results in recognition and degradation of this protein  <cit> . in this context, it is noteworthy that internalization and transport of proteins, particularly albumin, is of special interest in physiology as well as pathology of glomerular endothelium, both of which involve caveolins. a major caveolin is caveolin- <dig>  which is significantly related to albumin excretion  <cit> . ubiquitination seems to be responsible also for the turnover for cav <dig>  hence, the presence of cav <dig> in hgmec sage library and enrichment of ubiquitination go terms in addition to high concentration of ribosomal proteins substantiate the previously suggested characteristics of glomerular endothelium. novel differences between different microvascular ec appeared by comparing caveolae pathway: in contrast to hgmec the dermal microvascular ec  did not express any of the caveolin 1– <dig> in addition to some other qualitative differences . our results regarding the absence of adamts <dig> in hgmec are conflicting. the presence of this von willebrand cleaving protease had been demonstrated in immortalized glomerular as well as in dermal microvascular ec before  <cit> . in most of the previously established endothelial sage libraries including dermal microvascular ec  this molecule was not detected. neither a complete kidney  nor the liver endothelial cell sage library  expressed any adamts <dig> tags, although liver and kidney cells were used as positive controls in the study by tati et al. only the sage library from endothelium of normal colon expressed adamts <dig>  probably, this is due to the low abundance of this molecule as it was demonstrated by its appearance only at high cycle numbers of rt-pcr experiments especially in human glomerular and microvascular ec  <cit> . it can be argued that in spite of remarkable tag numbers the sizes of the sage libraries were too small to detect this transcript.

finally, when obtained transcript lists were further filtered using additional criteria  only one low abundance transcript, namely nrgn, stood out. it is reasonable to assume that a larger size of hgmec sage library would probably lead to the detection of a higher number of nrgn tags and more transcripts fulfilling same criteria. subsequently, we first confirmed the presence of nrgn transcript in hgmec by sequencing and then the in vivo expression of nrgn protein in human glomerular endothelium by immunohistochemistry. thus far, nrgn was believed to be brain specific and abundant in forebrain neurons whose interactions with calmodulin are suggested to play an important role in the regulation of synaptic responses and plasticity  <cit> . in brain, nrgn expression is dependent on thyroid hormones  <cit>  and it is a direct target of thyroid hormone action . there are numerous studies suggesting a link between thyroid and glomerular functions starting from embryogenesis  <cit>  and involving chronic kidney disease as well as acute kidney injury  <cit> , glomerular filtration rate  <cit>  or resistant proteinuria  <cit> . recent data in a rat model showed that proteinuria seen in hyperthyroidism is not due podocyte pathology and that hyper- as well as hypothyroidism lead to an increased capillary density when compared to control animals while hyperthyroidism resulted in an expansion of glomerular area  <cit> . yet, molecules linking both organ systems have never been defined. we postulate that nrgn in glomerular endothelium represents a potential link between the kidney and the thyroid as this was described for brain and thyroid. studies are underway to test the function of glomerular endothelial nrgn in the thyroid-kidney axis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we describe and analyze a hgmec sage library as the first quantitative description of the human glomerular endothelial transcriptome. by using open-source sage data from uncultured glomeruli and from  <dig> other non-glomerular endothelial cell types which were merged to gain a reference endothelial library as well as by employing specific in-silico analyses an efficient research strategy was established. in this method we included an analysis to verify the declared origin of large transcript lists and strongly suggest this or similar analyses should be employed whenever using such transcript lists before including them in the studies, because 11% of the analyzed endothelial sage libraries failed to qualify as such. also, integration of additional stringent filters into the bioinformatics to reduce the vast number of transcripts to manageable groups appeared to be indispensable. the described multi-step strategy which also involved go and pathway analyses was capable of determining a list of genes potentially expressed in vivo, highlighting glomerular endothelial uniqueness as well as endothelial diversity and identifying the low abundant nrgn for the first time in glomerular endothelium and confirming its expression in vitro and in vivo. the demonstration of nrgn as a molecule potentially linking glomerulus to thyroid and the sufficiency of our transcriptomic data providing a novel insight in significant differences between the glomerular and other endothelia represent novel and exciting findings in glomerular endothelial research.
