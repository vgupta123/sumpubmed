BACKGROUND
cholesterol levels within the brain may affect the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases including alzheimer's and parkinson's diseases and multiple sclerosis  <cit> . neuronal cholesterol levels are also thought to affect the progression of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , otherwise known as prion diseases  <cit> . these diseases are associated with the conversion of the normal cellular prion protein  to an alternatively folded isoform   <cit> . the accumulation of prpsc is closely associated with the main pathological features of tses: the spongiform degeneration of the brain, synaptic alterations, glial cell activation and extensive neuronal loss  <cit> . while a recent study reported that prion infection in vivo was associated with changes in brain cholesterol levels  <cit> , the change in cholesterol regulation in neurons following prion infection has not been characterised extensively. furthermore, because the brain is composed of diverse cell types, it is possible that changes in the cholesterol content of neurons may be obscured in mixed cell populations or whole brain studies. to reduce the problem of cell heterogeneity, the effects of prion infection on two neuronal cell lines were examined. we report that prion infection is associated with increased amounts of free cholesterol in the cell membrane, but also with reduced amounts of cholesterol esters suggesting that prion infection alters cholesterol regulation. the effects of prion infection on cholesterol balance were reproduced in primary cortical neurons incubated with exogenous prpsc preparations.

disturbing cholesterol metabolism within cells may have profound effects on cell function. although cholesterol is a component of normal cell membranes, the amounts of free cholesterol are increased between three- and five-fold in specialised detergent-resistant micro-domains within the plasma membrane that are commonly called lipid rafts  <cit> . such lipid rafts are also highly enriched in sphingolipids and gangliosides, and contain specific proteins  <cit> . the raft-associated proteins include many proteins attached to membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchor  <cit>  including both prpc and prpsc  <cit> . in addition, cellular receptors for folate or the p <dig> neurotrophin receptor are found within rafts  <cit> , as are receptors for neurotransmitters including acetylcholine  <cit>  and gamma-aminobutyric acid  <cit> . such domains also contain components of signalling pathways including the src family tyrosine kinases  <cit> , adenylyl cyclase  <cit> , the trimeric g-proteins  <cit>  and cytoplasmic phospholipase a <dig>   <cit> . lipid rafts act as membrane platforms that concentrate molecules for cell signalling  <cit>  and changes in membrane cholesterol levels may lead to abnormal cell signalling. as the neurotoxicity of prpsc was blocked by pla <dig> inhibitors  <cit>  the effects of prion infection on pla <dig> activity was examined. here we report increased activation  of cpla <dig> in scgt <dig> cells.

RESULTS
prion infection increased free cholesterol in neuronal cell lines
the amounts of protein and cholesterol in two prion-infected neuronal cell lines  were compared to that of uninfected controls . there were no significant differences in the amounts of protein between infected and uninfected cells. in contrast, the amounts of total cholesterol  were significantly higher in infected scgt <dig> cells than in gt <dig> cells  . more detailed analysis showed that the amounts of free cholesterol within scgt <dig> cells were 36% higher than those in gt <dig> cells , while the amounts of esterified cholesterol were 50% less than in gt <dig> cells . similar results were obtained when scn2a and n2a cells were compared: amounts of free cholesterol in scn2a cells were 23% higher than in n2a cells , but the amounts of esterified cholesterol were significantly lower than those of n2a cells . thus, in both cell lines prion infection was associated with a significant decrease in the amounts of cholesterol esters and in the percentage of cholesterol that was esterified .

brain-derived neurotrophic factor  increased the prpsc content of scgt <dig> cells  <cit> . here we report that treatment with bdnf, glial-derived neurotrophic factor  or retinoic acid also increased the prpsc content of scgt <dig> cells, while treatment with nerve-growth factor  did not . the increased prpsc content of treated scgt <dig> cells was accompanied by increased amounts of free cholesterol. the free cholesterol content of scgt <dig> cells was significantly higher in cells treated with bdnf , gdnf  or retinoic acid  but not in cells treated with ngf . none of the treatments increased the cholesterol content of uninfected gt <dig> cells showing that the increases in free cholesterol were related to the prpsc content of cells. to examine this relationship further, scgt <dig> cells were treated with varying concentrations of gdnf and amounts of prpsc and free cholesterol were measured. a significant correlation coefficient between the amounts of prpsc and free cholesterol was observed ; see figure  <dig> 

prpsc increases the free cholesterol content of cortical neurons
as the above observations were on prion-infected neuronal cell lines, we sought to determine whether prpsc had the same effect on non-transformed cells. primary cortical neurons were incubated with sub-lethal amounts of prpsc, or equivalent amounts of prpc for  <dig> hours. the addition of prpsc increased the amounts of free cholesterol when compared with untreated cells or cells treated with prpc . the amounts of free cholesterol were significantly higher in neurons treated with  <dig> pg/ml prpsc than in untreated cells . similarly, the amounts of free cholesterol were significantly higher in neurons treated with  <dig> pg/ml prpsc . there was no significant difference in the amounts of free cholesterol in untreated neurons and in neurons incubated with  <dig> pg/ml prpc .

stimulating cholesterol synthesis increases cholesterol esters but not free cholesterol in neurons
the possibility that prion infection stimulated cholesterol synthesis was examined by comparing the effects of prpsc with those of increased cholesterol biosynthesis in cortical neurons. mevalonate is a precursor of cholesterol synthesis that is a product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a  reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis  <cit> . treatment with  <dig> μm mevalonate significantly increased the amounts of total cholesterol in neurons ; this increase consisted primarily of cholesterol esters  as the amounts of free cholesterol were unchanged . similar results were obtained in cells treated with  <dig> μm cholesterol, which increased the amounts of cholesterol esters  but not free cholesterol ; see figure  <dig>  the percentage of cholesterol that was esterified in untreated cells  was raised to 17% ±  <dig> in neurons incubated with mevalonate, and 22% ±  <dig> in neurons treated with cholesterol. the addition of mevalonate or cholesterol did not affect the protein content of cell extracts.

prion infection increased activation of cpla <dig> in neuronal cell lines
as lipid rafts act as platforms in which signalling complexes assemble  <cit> , the possibility that the altered composition of lipid rafts in prion-infected cells affected cell signalling was examined. more specifically, as pla <dig> was required for prion formation  <cit> , the amounts of activated cpla <dig> in cells were examined. the amounts of activated  cpla <dig> in scgt <dig> cells were greater than those in gt <dig> cells . the relationship between activated cpla <dig> and prpsc was examined in scgt <dig> cells treated with different neurotrophins or retinoic acid. the increased prpsc content of treated scgt <dig> cells was accompanied by increased amounts of activated cpla <dig>  the amounts of activated cpla <dig> in scgt <dig> cells was significantly higher in cells treated with bdnf , gdnf  or retinoic acid  but not in cells treated with ngf . in contrast, none of these treatments significantly increased the amounts of activated cpla <dig> in gt <dig> cells showing that increased activation of cpla <dig> is related to the prpsc content of cells . the relationship between cpla <dig> and prpsc was examined further in scgt <dig> cells treated with varying concentrations of gdnf. the correlation coefficient between the amounts of prpsc in cells and the amounts of activated cpla <dig> was significant ; see figure 4b.

confirmation of increased pla <dig> activity in scgt <dig> cells was provided by observations that the amounts of pge <dig> produced by scgt <dig> cells were significantly higher than that of gt <dig> cells . similarly, the amounts of pge <dig> produced by scn2a cells were significantly higher than that of n2a cells . to ensure that pge <dig> was produced via the pla2/cyclo-oxygenase pathway, scgt <dig> cells were treated with pla <dig> or cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors. the addition of the pla <dig> inhibitors reduced pge <dig> production in scgt <dig> cells; treatment with  <dig> μm aacocf <dig> reduced pge <dig> levels from  <dig> ±  <dig> to  <dig> ±  <dig>  n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> , while  <dig> μg/ml aristolochic acid reduced pge <dig> production to  <dig> ±  <dig>  n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> . cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors also reduced pge <dig> production,  <dig> nm acetyl-salicylic acid reduced pge <dig> levels from  <dig> ±  <dig> to  <dig> ±  <dig>  n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> , and  <dig> nm ibuprofen reduced pge <dig> production to  <dig> ±  <dig>  n =  <dig>  p =  <dig> .

rafts containing prpsc also contain cpla2
immunoprecipitation was used to determine whether cpla <dig> was associated with prp-containing lipid rafts in scgt <dig> cells. mab 4f <dig>  which recognises both prpc and prpsc, precipitated cpla <dig> out of membrane extracts from untreated scgt <dig> cells. two methods were used to show that cpla <dig> was associated with prpsc rather than prpc in these scgt <dig> cell extracts. first, immunoprecipitation with mab ic <dig>  which recognises prpc but not prpsc, did not precipitate cpla <dig> from scgt <dig> cells. second, immunoprecipitation with mab 4f <dig> precipitated cpla <dig> from scgt <dig> cells from which prpc had been removed following treatment with pi-plc . a mab to cd <dig>  or an igg <dig> isotype control, did not precipitate cpla <dig> from scgt <dig> cells. next we examined the distribution of activated cpla <dig> within scgt <dig> cells. the amounts of activated cpla <dig> in whole cell extracts  were compared with those in membranes precipitated with mab 4f <dig> and to the depleted membrane extract. greater than 60% of activated cpla <dig> was found in the immunoprecipitated membrane fraction .

discussion
the major goal of this study was to investigate the impact of prpsc on the biochemistry of cell membranes. the amounts of total cholesterol in membranes were significantly higher in prion-infected cell lines than in their uninfected counterparts and there was a significant correlation between amounts of cholesterol and prpsc. more specifically, prion infection was associated with a significant increase in the amounts of free cholesterol. while much of what is known about the role of cholesterol in cell membranes is surmised from the changes in cells brought about by cholesterol depletion, either from cholesterol synthesis inhibitors or via cholesterol extraction, little is known about how neurons respond when the cholesterol content of membranes is increased.

how the presence of prions affects cholesterol levels remains to be determined. a synthetic prion-derived peptide activated hmg-coa reductase suggesting a mechanism by which prion infection increased cholesterol production  <cit> . however, we were unable to replicate the effects of prion infection in non-infected cells by stimulating cholesterol biosynthesis or by adding exogenous cholesterol. the addition of mevalonate or cholesterol did not increase the amounts of free cholesterol in cell membranes; rather, they increased the amounts of cholesterol esters. this contrasts with the situation in prion-infected cells where the amounts of cholesterol esters were reduced. cholesterol in cells is found either as free cholesterol in membranes or as cholesterol esters in cytoplasmic droplets. a dynamic equilibrium between the pools of free cholesterol and cholesterol esters is tightly controlled by acyl-coenzyme a:cholesterol acyltransferase , an endoplasmic reticulum -resident enzyme that catalyses the formation of cholesterol esters from cholesterol and long-chain fatty acids  <cit> . in uninfected cells excess free cholesterol activates acat resulting in increased production of cholesterol esters. in these cells, increased free cholesterol levels were only seen following the addition of a combination of free cholesterol and an acat inhibitor .

the situation in prion-infected cells, where the increased amounts of free cholesterol is accompanied by reduced amounts of cholesterol esters, is unusual. the increase in free cholesterol and the reduction of cholesterol esters in prion-infected cells may be a result of direct inhibition of acat or by sequestration of cholesterol in micro-environments that avoid acat. the amount of cholesterol in cell membranes is partly determined by its fatty acid composition. the high incidence of saturated fatty acids attached to sphingolipids, gangliosides and gpi-anchored proteins allows tight molecular packing and increases the solubilisation of free cholesterol  <cit> . thus, the formation of prpsc may have a direct effect on the composition of cell membranes as the self-aggregation of prpsc results in the clustering of gpi anchors attached to prpsc. the increased density of saturated fatty acids within prpsc-containing micro-domains encourages the solubilisation of free cholesterol and the remodelling of those membranes.

increasing the free cholesterol content of membranes is thought to reduce membrane fluidity and subsequently affect the endocytosis and trafficking of proteins. therefore, the formation of prpsc may alter conventional lipid raft structure and the prpc-protein interactions that occur within lipid rafts. for example, prpc has been reported to bind to caveolin- <dig>  <cit>  or n-cam  <cit> , proteins that reside within lipid rafts. it is unclear whether these protein-protein interactions are affected following the conversion of prpc to prpsc. the sequestration of free cholesterol into prpsc-containing lipid rafts may deplete free cholesterol from other cellular pools where it helps to stabilise the packing of sphingolipids, gangliosides and raft-associated proteins in the membrane. this may affect the function of such proteins. for example, free cholesterol affects the formation and function of synapses  <cit> . therefore, sequestration of cholesterol by prpsc may affect synaptic transmission, a hypothesis supported by observations that scgt <dig> cells contain altered amounts of synaptic proteins including synaptophysin  <cit>  and that synapse damage is seen during the early stages of experimental prion diseases  <cit> .

cholesterol-dependent micro-domains are increasingly implicated as platforms necessary for cell signalling  <cit>  and scrapie infections of neuronal cells are associated with increased levels of src kinase  <cit> . the activation of pla <dig> that is necessary for prion formation  <cit>  is reduced in cholesterol-depleted cells suggesting that this enzyme may reside within a lipid raft  <cit> . here we show that scgt <dig> cells contained four times as much activated cpla <dig> as gt <dig> cells and there was a significant correlation between amounts of activated cpla <dig> and prpsc. immunoprecipitation studies showed that activated cpla2co-localised with prpsc-containing lipid rafts in scgt <dig> cells. previous studies showed that cell activation results in the translocation of cpla <dig> to endoplasmic and plasma membranes  <cit> . our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that prion infection stimulates the translocation of cpla <dig> to lipid rafts containing prpsc. the activation of cpla <dig> is associated with the production of prostaglandins and the amounts of pge <dig> produced by scgt <dig> cells were significantly higher than that of gt <dig> cells. our observation that pre-treatment of scgt <dig> cells with pla <dig> or cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors reduced pge <dig> production showed that pge <dig> was a valid measure of pla <dig> activity in these cells. these findings are consistent with reports of increased pge <dig> in murine scrapie  <cit>  and raised levels of pge <dig> in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with creutzfeldt-jakob disease  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that the presence of prpsc increased the free cholesterol content of cell membranes. the increased free cholesterol could not be replicated by the stimulation of cholesterol synthesis or by the addition of exogenous free cholesterol, which increased the amounts of cholesterol esters. our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the clustering of saturated fatty acids, parts of the gpi anchors attached to prpsc, increased the amounts of free cholesterol solubilised within the plasma membrane which increased membrane rigidity. these changes in cell membranes could reduce endocytosis and the recycling of cholesterol through the er where it is exposed to acat, consistent with reduced cholesterol ester production in infected cells. the increased amounts of free cholesterol in the plasma membrane were associated with increased activation of the pla <dig> pathway that is necessary for prpsc-mediated neurotoxicity. this is a rare example of an infective agent increasing free cholesterol levels within cell membranes and raises the possibility that disturbances in membrane cholesterol are major triggering events in neurodegenerative diseases.
