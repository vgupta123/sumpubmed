BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fluorescens is a gram-negative psychrotrophic bacterium that can be divided into five biovars . this bacterium has frequently been isolated from milk and food related environments and characterized due to its relevant spoilage activity. pseudomonas spp. are the main concern with regard to proteolytic degradation of milk, along with other less proteolytic degradative and milk coagulant organisms such as achromobacter, aeromonas, flavobacterium, and xanthomonas spp.  <cit> .

studies with phages as control organisms of bacterial infections have increased in the recent years mainly due to the emergence of bacterial resistance to a vast number of antimicrobial agents. phage therapy has again become a field worth of attention after years of abandonment in the western world. phage application to humans and to animals is already being performed, nevertheless there is hardly any literature on studies concerning industrial environments and the use of phages as sanitation agents. although the spoilage ability of p. fluorescens is well known, there are no studies involving the use of phages capable of infecting dairy industry isolates of this host species. essentially, the work on pseudomonad phages is concentrated on p. aeruginosa phages due to the clinical relevance of this strain, which is an opportunistic pathogen affecting mainly immunocompromised people and those suffering from cystic fibroses. there is some work done with p. fluorescens and phages focused on co-evolution studies  <cit> . so far, bacteriophages for p. fluorescens were never closer characterized in view of their physico-chemical, morphological, and life cycle properties.

here we describe the isolation of phages for the milk spoilage bacterium p. fluorescens and the further characterization of one phage with a very high lytic efficiency. the data of this work indicate that this effective phage belongs to the t7-group of bacteriophages and that it may be a good sanitizing agent for control of environments where p. fluorescens may provoke a quality risk.

RESULTS
isolation and host range characterization of promising lytic phages
the aim of this work was to isolate, select and characterize an effective lytic phage for a range of p. fluorescens strains. therefore, initially several phages were isolated from raw sewage of a wastewater treatment plant that receives effluents from different dairy plants. isolation was performed using the enrichment method with different test species of p. fluorescens, which had been earlier isolated from portuguese and united states dairy plants. these isolates include different ribotypes and also strains with different enzymatic activities . not all p. fluorescens are capable of producing degradative defects in processed milk. therefore isolates from new york dairy industries which were able to produce extracellular enzymes that are problematic for milk products and cause their respective spoilage  <cit>  were included in this study. all initial tests were performed with ny p. fluorescens isolates positive for protease, lipase, and lecithinase activity , with exception of two of the strains, d3- <dig> and b1- <dig> which were able to produce only one type of enzyme, protease or lipase, respectively.

altogether  <dig> phages were isolated and showed lytic activity against some of the different bacterial strains . all the isolated phages were used in further screening assays using the phage spot test on bacterial lawns of each different strains in order is to characterize their host range and to select the phage capable of infecting the greatest number of p. fluorescens strains. this screening procedure is the basis of phage typing methods and it enabled the differentiation of  <dig> different p. fluorescens strains as they resulted in dissimilar phage screenings profiles.

* not tested, c – clear phage plaque, t – turbid phage plaque, tt – very turbid, – no phage plaque

according to the phage lytic profiles, the phages were divided into  <dig> different groups based on the host susceptibility, as indicated on the bottom of table  <dig>  each group is characterized by the same lytic profile of the phages for the same host strains, which either were sensitive to the distinct phages, by showing clear or turbid plaques, or resistant . from these results it seems very likely that the phages belonging to different groups also represent different phages. several phages were able to lyse most of the p. fluorescens isolates from the portuguese dairy plant, however some phages were more host-specific, such as the phages isolated for p. fluorescens strains d3- <dig> and  <dig>  phages ϕibb-d3-331a to c only formed clear plaques on the p. fluorescens isolate d3- <dig> and a turbid plaque in one more isolate. phages ϕibb-33b to d caused turbid plaques on the host which was used for isolation and only ϕibb-33d was additionally able to produce clear plaques on host strain  <dig>  the phages with the widest host range belonged to group  <dig> and where isolated with the p. fluorescens strains number  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. from the phage group  <dig>  phage ϕibb-pf7a had the largest plaque diameter . therefore, phage ϕibb-pf7a was selected for further characterization studies and tested for lysis ability in other characterized p. fluorescens isolates and other pseudomonas species provided  by the cornell university  which were unable to produce extracellular enzymes. phage ϕibb-pf7a was only able to form plaques on p. fluorescens strains and did not lyse the three pseudomonas species tested .

p. fluorescens ribotypes tested where: 409-s- <dig>  422-s- <dig>  408-s- <dig>  50-s- <dig>  and 57-s- <dig>  ribotypes 50-s- <dig> and 57-s- <dig> belong to p. fluorescens biovar ii and the respective isolates, b1- <dig> and d1- <dig>  cluster between the p. fluorescens and p. putida lineages in the so-called b <dig> cluster. ribotypes 409-s- <dig>  408-s- <dig> and 422-s- <dig> have not been classified according to the biovar to which they belong. according to dogan and boor  <cit> , from  <dig> pseudomonas spp. isolated from four new yok dairy plants,  <dig> isolates had p. fluorescens ribotypes. furthermore, only 19% of the total pseudomonas spp., or approximately  <dig> p. fluorescens ribotypes, are found in more than one dairy plant, while the other 81% are dairy plant specific ribotypes. taking this into account and the fact that phage ϕibb-pf7a could infect  <dig> different strains of which  <dig> were had different ribotypes suggests that ϕibb-pf7a may be an interesting candidate for sanitizing applications and therefore was further characterized.

morphology of the phage particles
morphological characterization of phages using transmission electron microscopy , one of the most used methods to classify phages, showed that phage ϕibb-pf7a has a pentagonal outline indicating an icosahedral nature . according to the tem micrograph, phage ϕibb-pf7a belongs to the podoviridae family, which is characterized by phages with a short non-contractile tail. phage ϕibb-pf7a has a very short tail most likely belonging to type c in bradley's classification  <cit> . furthermore, the diameters of phage ϕibb-pf7a's icosahedral capsid and tail length  are similar to typical morphological values observed in members of the t <dig> phage group .

phage dna studies
the isolation of phage dna and the application of restriction enzymes allow the approximate determination of the genomic size of phages and evaluate if the size is consistent with the t <dig> classification proposed through the tem observation. the restriction of phage ϕibb-pf7a dna was performed with ecori and hindiii. the sum of the fragments resulted in the following genomic sizes:  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp with ecori and hindiii, respectively . the approximate genomic size of ϕibb-pf7a with ecori and hindiii is approximately  <dig> kbp which is in the range of t <dig> phages that varies between  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp as further discussed below.

analysis of phage structural proteins
to further characterize ϕibb-pf7a, its protein composition was analyzed by sds-page and  <dig> bands were n-terminally sequenced. sds-page allows the observation of the number of structural proteins present on this phage and to evaluate the similarities with protein profiles of known t <dig> structural proteins.

at least  <dig> bands can be clearly distinguished in the gradient gel  ranging from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> kda. the most predominant polypeptide band appeared at a size of approximately  <dig> kda. this band  could be assigned to the t <dig> major capsid protein 10a by its size and by its n-terminal sequence determination of the first  <dig> amino acid residues. this protein has 80% of sequence homology with ϕyeo3- <dig> and t <dig> phages, which are both members of the t <dig> phage supergroup. also four other protein bands could be correlated with t <dig> structural proteins: t <dig> tail fiber protein in the monomeric form ; head-tail connector protein , capsid assembly protein , and also the internal virion protein b   <cit> . one of these four bands, the  <dig>  kda band , gave a signal in the n-terminal sequence determination. the  <dig>  kda band resulted in  <dig> clearly determined amino acid residues and was 80% similar to a hypothetical protein of thalassomonas phage ba <dig>  like ϕibb-pf7a, phage ba <dig> also belongs to the podoviridae family of phages but has not yet been further classified. the n-terminal sequence of the  <dig>  kda protein band did not give sequence which indicates that this protein is n terminally blocked. the analysis of ϕibb-pf7a structural proteins clearly demonstrate that there are comparable proteins to other t7-like phages and like other phages belonging to this group, the most predominant structural protein is the major capsid protein 10a as verified by n-terminal sequencing.

phage growth characteristics
the em, genomic and structural protein studies permit to classify ϕibb-pf7a as a t7-like phage. furthermore, it was our aim to characterize ϕibb-pf7a's life cycle and adsorption ability. firstly, one-step growth studies were performed to identify the different phases of a phage infection process. after infection of ϕibb-pf7a's host, the p. fluorescens isolate nr.  <dig>  the phage growth cycle parameters – the latent period, eclipse period, rise period, and burst size, were determined from the dynamical change of the number of free and total phages . in the system studied, the eclipse and latent periods of ϕibb-pf7a were very short,  <dig> and  <dig> min, respectively. ϕibb-pf7a yielded a burst size of  <dig> pfu per infected cell after  <dig> min at rt. these phage life cycle values are in conformity with the values normally observed for t <dig> group phages.

the adsorption efficiency of phages to the host was estimated with cells in the early logarithmic growth phase. the experiment was carried out at room temperature under constant shaking  and a phage inocculum of moi =  <dig> . the number of free phages was calculated from the pfu of chloroform-treated samples within  <dig> min after inoculation . phage ϕibb-pf7a appears to have two adsorption phases: a very rapid adsorption to its host during the first  <dig> min is followed by a slower rate of attachment after  <dig> min. the number of free phages was below 10% already within  <dig> min and below 5% within  <dig> min after infection . the adsorption rate, which represents the phage adsorption affinity towards the host, was calculated according to barry and walter  <cit>  for a period of  <dig> min. the adsorption rate constant of phage ϕibb-pf7a was calculated to be  <dig>  × 10- <dig> ml min- <dig>  which is similar to other t <dig> rates in literature  <cit> .

discussion
pseudomonas fluorescens is a major milk product contaminant as well as spoilage causing agent of fresh poultry and refrigerated foods, in particular of refrigerated meats  <cit> . product contamination occurs at different stages of processing which shows that it is difficult to maintain the processing environment clean from this bacterium mainly due to the ecologic diversity and multiple origins of pseudomonas spp.  <cit> . phages have been suggested as alternative anti-microbial agents for a variety of pathogenic bacteria found in food processing environments  <cit> . so far, no phages have been closely studied for their ability to infect the spoilage causing bacterium p. fluorescens. the bacterial isolates tested in this work include different ribotypes and isolates capable of producing extracellular enzymes, such as protease, lecithinase and lipase that cause spoilage of milk products. a number of phages were isolated for p. fluorescens, some of which exhibited a high efficiency in lysing different p. fluorescens isolates while others had a narrower host range. this shows that a variety of lytic p. fluorescens phages can be easily isolated from the environment and their use as alternative sanitation agents will most likely be feasible for application in food and dairy industry as demonstrated by studies with p. fluorescens biofilms subjected to phage  <cit> .

of all the phages isolated, phage ϕibb-pf7a was selected for further characterization. this novel highly lytic phage ϕibb-pf7a has a strong virulence towards a number of p. fluorescens present on portuguese and american dairy facilities. the verification of the ability of phage ϕibb-pf7a in infecting isolates capable of producing extracellular enzymes isolates was an exceptionally important result and is an additional argument for phage based sanitation – it is possible to select phages only for a specific range of bacteria, in this case for the enzyme producing bacteria that are the major spoilage causative microorganisms.

the structural proteins are similar with known t <dig> proteins. five distinct protein bands were identified according to their size representing the t <dig> tail fiber protein, the minor capsid protein, the major capsid protein 10a, the capsid assembly protein, and the internal virion protein b  <cit> . in fact, n-terminal sequencing identified one of the protein bands as the t7-like major capsid protein 10a.

phage ϕibb-pf7a has a genome size of about  <dig> kbp  which is very close to the t <dig> phage ϕkmv , a pseudomonas aeruginosa phage  <cit> . this is well in the range of genome sizes of other t7-like phages; the smallest t7-like phage genome sequenced so far is the e. coli phage t <dig> having a size of  <dig>  bp and the largest t7-like phage, a vibrio parahaemolyticus phage, has a size of  <dig>  bp  <cit> .

the adsorption rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> ml min- <dig> obtained through the one-step growth curve  is also well in accordance with other t7-like phages, with values varying between  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> ml min- <dig>  depending on whether the bacteria are alive or were killed  <cit> .

the use of phages of the podoviridae group, specifically t7-like phages, as therapeutic agents has been reported for different bacteria. p. aeruginosa t7-like phages ϕkmv, lkd <dig>  and lka <dig> have been suggested as good biological agents due to their ability to infect a variety of clinical p. aeruginosa isolates  <cit> . phage pppw- <dig> for p. plecoglossicida has been suggested equally suggested for combating the hemorrhagic ascites disease in cultured ayu fish  <cit> . aside from the high rate of development of t7-like phages if e.g. compared to t <dig> phages that are being used in animal therapy, t7-like phages are also interesting for their small genome, which decreases the chance of transferring extended fragments of chromosomal dna with pathogenicity islands  <cit>  to host strains.

the data obtained in this study support the hypothesis that phage ϕibb-pf7a can be a good candidate for phage based sanitation in food processing environments, preventing product spoilage due to extracellular enzyme producing p. fluorescens strains.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first report with a detailed study of phages isolated for dairy p. fluorescens isolates. the newly isolated t7-like phage has an increased potential for lysing a variety of isolates and has several attractive features such as very short replication times and very fast adsorption ability which makes the phage a promising candidate for therapeutic or sanitation purposes.
