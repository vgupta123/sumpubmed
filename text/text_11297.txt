BACKGROUND
xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  is a gram-negative plant pathogenic bacterium that causes leaf blight in rice plants, thus having a serious effect on rice production in taiwan, china, japan, india, and south america  <cit> . agrochemicals have been somewhat effective for disease control, although biological control using bacteriophages has been considered  <cit> . in addition, phages that specifically infect xoo have been used to type xoo hosts in the field  <cit> .

among the xoo phages are the lytic phages xp <dig>  xp <dig>  op <dig>  and op <dig>  and the filamentous phages xf and phixo  <cit> . recently, the genomic sequences of xp <dig> , op <dig> , and op <dig>  were determined. xp <dig> and op <dig> both have linear genomes and share high degrees of similarity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels  <cit> . in contrast, op <dig> has a circularly permuted and terminally redundant genome, which differs in sequence from those of xp <dig> and op <dig>  <cit> . xp <dig> is a phage of x. campestris pv. pelargonii; its genomic sequence  is available in the ncbi database .

we recently isolated a xoo bacteriophage, xop <dig>  from rice plants from a rice paddy near national chung hsing university that showed serious symptoms of bacterial leaf blight  <cit> . during our sequencing of the xop <dig> phage genome, the genomic sequences of xp <dig> and op <dig> were published  <cit> . since comparative analysis of several bacteriophages from a single species offers a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms that drive prokaryotic genetic diversity  <cit> , we compared the sequence of xop <dig> with those of xp <dig>  isolated in taiwan in  <dig>  and op <dig>  isolated in japan in  <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
assignments of xop <dig> genes
assembly of over  <dig> overlapped sequences  of the xop <dig> genome showed that it was linear and consisted of  <dig>  bp. the terminal sequence, 5'-ggacagtct-3', is identical to the 9-bp 3'-protruding sequence of xp <dig> but was not observed in op <dig>  <cit> . the g+c contents of the three xoo phages were similar, 52% each for xop <dig> and xp <dig> and 51% for op <dig>  <cit> , but deviated from the 65% of xoo  <cit> . the three phages showed highly similar genomic organization and highly similar protein products . the xp <dig> gene numbers were used for the corresponding genes  in xop <dig>  with a two-part number assigned when an additional gene was present, for example  <dig>  for the gene between  <dig> and  <dig> . some genes, encoding hnh endonucleases  or hypothetical proteins, were only found in xop <dig> , xp <dig>  or op <dig> , or were missing only from xop <dig> , xp <dig>  or op <dig>  . these findings indicate that numerous insertions/deletions have occurred in the xoo phages. more deduced xop <dig> proteins shared higher degrees of similarity with xp <dig> than with op <dig> proteins. only  <dig> xop <dig> proteins, most located between p <dig> and p <dig>  shared higher identities with op <dig> than with xp <dig> proteins . these findings suggest that xop <dig> is more closely related to xp <dig> than to op <dig>  although sequence information from more phages is required, discrepancies in similarity indicate that geographical separation may have limited lateral gene transfer between phages and other sources.

a, b, and c indicate sequence comparison with a protein from xop <dig>  op <dig>  and xp <dig> itself, respectively. d, predicted orf in this study. symbol -, no similarity was found.

holin genes required for host lysis were not assigned for xp <dig> and op <dig>  <cit> . these genes are usually small and adjacent to the cognate lysozyme genes, with their protein products usually containing at least one transmembrane domain  and a hydrophilic c-terminal domain  <cit> . in xop <dig>  p <dig>  , located upstream of the previously characterized lysozyme gene   <cit> , was assigned as the putative holin gene. however, since p <dig>  overlaps with p <dig> by  <dig> bp and lacks a hydrophilic c-terminal domain, it is unclear whether it encodes holin function. a corresponding orf was identified in op <dig>  but the corresponding region in xp <dig> was assigned to the n-terminus of the lysozyme gene .

the next best matched orfs other than those from xp <dig> and op1
the deduced xop <dig> proteins also share similarities with proteins other than those of xp <dig> and op <dig>  and proteins encoded in five xop <dig> regions are worth noting : 1) the tail-related proteins p <dig> to p <dig>  encoded in a  <dig> -kb region, share 33–44% identity  with orfs of the x. campestris pv. pelargonii phage xp <dig>  2) proteins p <dig> to p <dig>  encoded in a  <dig> -kb region and including tail fiber and phage lysozyme, show 33–48% identity to proteins from chromobacterium violaceum. 3) proteins p <dig> to p <dig>  encoded in a  <dig> -kb region, share 30–47% identity with proteins from pseudomonas aeruginosa. 4) proteins p <dig> to p <dig>  encoded in a  <dig> -kb region, show 38–45% identity to proteins from burkholderia pseudomallei. 5) protein p <dig> shares 60% identity with a protein from bradyrhizobium sp. in addition, xop <dig> p <dig> , p <dig>  and p <dig>  are similar to proteins from xylella fastidiosa  and x. axonopodis pv. citri  . these data suggest that xoo phages have actively participated in gene transfer with several organisms. in contrast, the xoo genome did not contain homologues with significant similarity  to the proteins of the three phages. since the xoo phages are lytic, opportunities to exchange genetic material with the host may have been rare.

gene products related to endonucleases of the hnh family
members of the hnh endonuclease family are encoded by free-standing orfs between genes or within introns or inteins in viruses, bacteriophages, and bacteria, as well as in eukaryotic nuclear and organellar genomes  <cit> . most of these proteins are homing endonucleases involved in the mobility of their own genes or of the introns/inteins in which they are located  <cit> . these hnh proteins are characterized by the motif his-asn-his at the n-terminus but share little overall sequence similarity and can be classified into  <dig> subsets  <cit> . proteins of the second subset usually consist of an hnn domain and an adjacent dna-binding domain, ap <dig>  or ienri , and are found primarily in phage genomes  <cit> . for example, multiple copies of hnh endonuclease genes are present in the sequenced genomes of coliphages rb <dig> , rb <dig> , t <dig>  <cit> , rtp  <cit>  and t <dig>  <cit>  as well as in the lactophage bil <dig>  <cit> .

xp <dig> and op <dig> contain  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes encoding hnh endonucleases, respectively  <cit> . it was suggested that i) these proteins conserve many functionally important residues which may preserve their ability to bind dna, ii) these genes may have populated the genomes through gene duplication and/or transposition, iii) their presence may account for the branched dna structures observed by electron microscopy following denaturation and renaturation, and iv) one or more of these hnh family proteins may be involved in domain duplication of the tail fiber, which can alter the host range   <cit> . the xop <dig> genome was found to contain  <dig>  hnh endonuclease genes . using weblogo to analyze these  <dig> xoo phage proteins, consensus sequences were generated for the hnh and ap <dig> domains   <cit> . they could be divided into  <dig> groups . the hnn domain was found in proteins of groups i , ii  and iii , whereas the hnh domain was detected only in the  <dig> proteins of group iv, which do not retain an ap <dig> domain. the  <dig> proteins in group v had degenerated, losing their hnh domains and over half of the n-terminus of their ap <dig> domains. a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of  <dig> conserved amino acids of the hnh domain of the  <dig> proteins in groups i to iv suggests that the hnh type endonucleases may have arisen from an ancestor different from that of the hnn type endonucleases .

we found that all the hnn domain-containing proteins of the xoo phages have conserved asp/his residues flanked by two quasi-conserved boxes  at the n-terminus and three conserved boxes  at the c-terminus, but do not have either metal-binding cysteine-dyads  or conserved gg motifs . the lack of a metal-binding motif suggests that these hnn type endonucleases may not require zinc ion to function. since most hnn-ap2/ienri proteins are intron-encoded site-specific endonucleases  <cit> , the presence of multiple hnn-ap <dig> endonuclease genes in all three xoo phage genomes suggests that these genes, like the homing-endonuclease genes , are able to self-duplicate in the genome. however, since no conserved sequences could be identified in the flanking regions of these endonuclease genes and their genomic locations varied among the three phages, it is likely that transmission of these hnn-ap <dig> endonuclease genes was sequence-independent.

the hnh domains of the group iv proteins, which share higher degrees of similarity with the consensus hnh domain, have two cysteine-dyads  flanking the conserved asp/his residues, suggesting that zinc ion is required for their function, as well as two boxes  on the c-terminal side of each domain . these group iv proteins are similar to the hnh-type protein  found in the lactophage bil <dig>  which has two cysteine-dyads  and no dna-binding motif  <cit> . as endonucleases of this type are present as unique copies at the analogous positions of the xoo phage genomes , they may have specific functions other than transposition, similar to the hnn-ap <dig> type endonucleases.

the hnn-ap <dig> type endonuclease genes may not only be able to transmit into multiple sites of the genome but may also degenerate. for example, although the genes hegg and hegj are present in the genomes of three t <dig> phage strains, our sequence analyses showed that full-length genes are retained in the strains sequenced in france  and moscow , but that both genes had degenerated in the t <dig> strain atcc11303-b <dig> . specifically, a short insertion disrupted hegg  and two point deletions caused frame shifts in hegj , suggesting that degeneration of hnh endonuclease genes may occur after a deleterious insertion/deletion. in addition, one t <dig> hnh type mob endonuclease gene, moba, was found to have degenerated into a pseudogene  <cit> . a cyclical model of gain and loss of hegs  <cit>  has been used to deduce the possible evolutionary path of the i-scei endonucleases of a self-splicing group i intron in saccharomyces cerevisiae and the intron/heg of t-even-like phages  <cit> . for xoo phages, however, the data may be better explained by a linear model of gain and loss, in which functional alien endonuclease genes would be fixed but start degenerating after successful incorporation . for example, in xp <dig>  proteins p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  each with intact hnh and ap <dig> domains, may represent endonuclease family members that retain their functions; proteins p <dig>  and p <dig>  may represent proteins after different degrees of progressive degeneration; and protein p <dig>  which has only a small segment of a highly degenerated ap <dig> domain, may represent a gene product with the greatest extent of degeneration and the most ancient hnh-ap <dig> endonuclease in the genome . similar clues to gene degeneration were observed in the hnh-ap <dig> endonuclease genes of the other two phages .

promoters and terminators
we found that the nucleotide sequences between the end of p <dig> and the right end of the genome were highly variable in the three xoo phages, with xp <dig> and op <dig> being more similar to each other than either were to xop <dig>  and segments with higher degrees of identity present at different positions . mosaicism of the common segments suggests that these phages have undergone numerous recombination events, possibly during co-infections, resulting in gene rearrangements and insertion/deletion. in xp <dig>  the intergenic region between p <dig> and p <dig> separates the genes transcribed leftward and rightward and contains all six promoters  <cit> . based on a similarity search, we located putative promoters resembling those of xp <dig> in xop <dig> and op <dig>  we found that the promoter sequences in xp <dig> and op <dig> were highly conserved, but shared lower degrees of identity with the xop <dig> promoters . in addition, xop <dig> had five sequences located between p <dig> and p <dig>  and one sequence, p <dig>  between p <dig>  and p <dig>  whereas op <dig> had four sequences located between orf <dig> and orf <dig> and two, pup and φp <dig>  contained within orf <dig> .

similarity searches of the xop <dig> and op <dig> genomes for the five predicted terminators of xp <dig>  <cit>  revealed four corresponding sequences at analogous positions . these predicted terminators in xop <dig>  tr <dig> to tr <dig>  each shared high degrees of identity with the respective analogous terminators in the other phages. however, sequences similar to xp <dig> tr <dig>  which is thought to possess a low efficiency of termination  <cit> , were not found in xop <dig> and op <dig>  suggesting that such a low-efficiency terminator may not be essential.

domain duplications in tail fiber and implications in host range
japanese isolates of xoo can be classified into four phagovars, based on their susceptibility to op <dig>  with host-range mutants of op <dig> capable of infecting different phagovars  <cit> . sequencing of the tail fiber genes from these phage strains revealed that changes in host range are due to duplications in at least one of three domains  in ca.  <dig> aa at the n-terminus . this is similar to findings in other phages; for example, the host range of t <dig> is expanded by duplications of a small region of the tail fiber adhesin  <cit> . amino acid sequence alignments showed that op <dig> possesses domains -1-2-3-, xp <dig> has domains -1-2-2-2-3-  <cit>  and xop <dig> exhibits domains -1-2-3-3-3- . interestingly, while op <dig> and oph <dig> have the same domain architecture  and no drastic changes in the surrounding amino acid residues, op <dig> infects only phagovar a whereas op1h infects only phagovar b   <cit> . this finding suggests that these related xoo phages might use a complex structure, also containing other component, to determine the host range, with mutations in the latter component altering the host range. further tests are needed to understand the host ranges of xop <dig> and xp <dig> 

in mouse minisatellite pc- <dig>  tandem repeats of dn, which can facilitate the formation of a telomere-like intra-molecular folded-back quadruplex structure, have been shown to be hotspots of recombination during meiosis  <cit> . the genes encoding the tail fibers of the xoo phages contain many short repeats , including i) inverted repeats that are all located outside the domains, which may be important in the acquisition/loss of domain architectures, ii) direct g-rich pentanucleotide  repeats at both ends of domains  <dig> and  <dig>  and iii) a direct g-rich octanucleotide  repeat flanking domain  <dig>  it is currently unclear whether the presence of these short direct repeats can facilitate the duplication/deletion of the tail fiber domains by recombination, as observed for mouse minisatellite pc- <dig>  inoue et. al. proposed that the hnh-family proteins may be involved in domain duplication via recombination using holliday junction structures as the intermediates  <cit> , but it is not clear if this is the mechanism occurring here.

identification of virion proteins
sds-page separation of the xp <dig> virion proteins resulted in  <dig> major bands, three of which  were identified  <cit> . sds-page separation of the xop <dig> virion proteins resulted in at least  <dig> discrete bands:  <dig>  on 12% gels and  <dig>  on 6% gels . lc ms/ms analysis  indicated that these bands contained  <dig> proteins,  <dig> from the virion and  <dig> from the host. the 250-, 200-, 150-, 78- and 42-kda bands contain oligomers of p <dig>  the  <dig> -kda major capsid subunit, of  <dig> to  <dig> subunits. oligomerization of p <dig> was also observed in xp <dig>  but in the 140- and 165-kda bands and in high mw materials in the gel wells. xp <dig> p <dig> may be cleaved by a phage-encoded protease, p <dig>  generating a mature major head protein of  <dig> aa, which is  <dig> aa less than the precursor protein  <cit> . in contrast, our n-terminal sequencing of the 42-kda band gave a sequence, tditsk, showing that only the n-terminal methionine was missing.

the head portal protein, p <dig>  with a calculated mw of  <dig> kda, was found in the 47- and 31-kda bands, suggesting that the unprocessed and processed forms co-exist in the virions. lc-ms/ms analysis showed that the 31-kda band contained another protein, p <dig>  which was identified as the tail fiber in xp <dig>  <cit> . n-terminal sequencing showed that the 22-kda band was p <dig>  the major tail protein in xp <dig>  the 13-kda band was also a doublet, containing p <dig>  and p <dig> . the 160-, 105-, and 11-kda bands were identified as p <dig> , p <dig> , and p <dig> , respectively. in summary, six more proteins than those identified for xp <dig> were found here, and the conserved proteins p <dig> and p <dig> in xp <dig> were found to be phage coat proteins.

the  <dig> host proteins in the  <dig> bands were tonb-dependent receptor fyua , outer membrane protein mopb and hypothetical protein xoo <dig> , mopb and colicin receptor protein cira , and hypothetical protein xoo <dig> . since the experiments were repeated four times using virions freshly purified by ultracentrifugation, the consistent presence of these proteins indicates that they were rather tightly associated with the phage particles.

CONCLUSIONS
our results, showing that xop <dig> and xp <dig> have the same g+c content and that more of the deduced xop <dig> proteins share higher degrees of identity with xp <dig> than with op <dig> proteins, indicate that the two phages isolated in taiwan are more closely related to each other than they are to op <dig>  thus, geographical separation may have limited lateral gene transfers between phages and other sources. however, our finding that more of the dna sequences are conserved by xp <dig> and op <dig> in the region between p <dig> and the right end of the genome, a region containing the predicted promoters, suggests that xop <dig> has undergone sequence rearrangements and insertions/deletions to a greater degree. the hnn-ap <dig> type endonucleases may have transferred their genes randomly and begun degenerating after successful horizontal transmission, whereas the hnh type endonucleases, each with one copy, were located within the same genome context. comparison of the host range and the architecture of the duplicated domains in the n-terminus of the tail fiber proteins suggests that the xoo phages may need additional components for adsorption. some of the repeated sequences in and around the domains may be involved in duplication/loss of the domains. we identified  <dig> more proteins than those identified for xp <dig>  with p <dig> and p <dig> shown to be phage coat proteins.
