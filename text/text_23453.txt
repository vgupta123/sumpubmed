BACKGROUND
dna replication and cell division are probably the most fundamental processes in the cell life cycle. both proceed through a remarkably conserved general mechanism and are inextricably intertwined to each others and to the cell metabolism  <cit> .

the dna replication cycle can be divided into three distinct stages; initiation, elongation, and termination. replication is initiated by the highly conserved aaa+ superfamily atpase-member dnaa that binds the oric, inducing dna strand melting  <cit> . in e. coli, dnaa also interacts with the ring helicase dnab and directs the loading of dnab/dnac onto the single stranded dna  region. after binding of dnab on the ssdna region of the oric, dnac is released in an atpase dependent manner. then, dnab recruits the dnag primase and dna polymerase iii to form the replication fork  <cit> . in b. subtilis, two additional essential proteins, called dnab  and dnad, are engaged in entry of the ring helicase at oric. dnab could function as a membrane anchoring factor for the replication initiation machinery  <cit>  or, together with dnai, the functional homolog of e. coli dnac  <cit> , in the recruitment of the ring helicase  <cit> . dnad interacts with both dnaa and dnab  <cit> . it exhibits dna remodelling activity, enhancing partial melting of the dna strands, and could, therefore, function in early steps of replication such as initiating the recruitment of the ring helicase  <cit> . during elongation, the replication forks constituted at the oric travel in opposite directions to achieve replication of the entire chromosome. when the replication forks reach the terminus, terc, the replication complexes are dismantled in a process involving specific termination factors  <cit> .

the earliest event in bacterial cytokinesis is the definition of the future cell division site. this occurs through the dynamic assembly/disassembly of the z-ring structure resulting from the self-polymerization of the ubiquitous tubulin-like protein ftsz  <cit> . placement of the z-ring is mainly dependent on the min system both in e. coli and in b. subtilis  <cit> . once assembled, the z-ring is believed to serve as a scaffold for recruitment of the cell division machinery to activate septation and physical separation of the daughter cells. in contrast to the model organisms e. coli and in b. subtilis, the molecular basis of cell division has not been as well studied in cyanobacteria. nevertheless, studies with the two unicellular cyanobacteria synechocystis pcc <dig> and synechococcus pcc <dig> and the filamentous anabaena pcc <dig>  have allowed the identification and the characterisation of clear fts and min orthologs as well as zipn/ftn <dig> and ftn <dig>  two cell division factors restricted to cyanobacteria  <cit> . although ftn <dig> deletion leads to cell division defects, resulting in cells dramatically elongated in synechococcus pcc <dig> or enlarged in anabaena pcc <dig>  <cit> , the molecular function of ftn <dig> remains unclear. nevertheless, recent data suggest an involvement of ftn <dig> in recruitment of ftsz proteins to the septum or subsequent z-ring assembly, as cells deleted for ftn <dig> do not exhibit condensed z-rings, but rather diffuse localization of ftsz  <cit> .

based on sequence and structure analyses, we here propose that the cyanobacterial-specific cell division factor ftn <dig> contains a not hitherto described n-terminal domain related to the dnad-like domain found in the dnad chromosomal replication protein family. identification of the ftn <dig> n-terminal domain, we termed fnd , opens up very interesting perspectives about ftn <dig> function in cell division and possibly in chromosome segregation as well as on their necessary interplay. consistently, we also showed that ftn6-depleted cells are sensitive to dna damages generated by uv rays.

RESULTS
ftn <dig> orthologs contain a conserved n-terminus domain 
to identify putative ftn <dig> motifs amenable for functional analysis, we performed database searches using the synechocystis pcc <dig> ftn <dig> protein sequence  as query. blast search of the ncbi-database allowed the identification of  <dig> ftn <dig> orthologs, all belonging to the cyanobacteria phylum. no ortholog was found in plastids or other prokaryotes. interestingly, ftn <dig> orthologs were found in all nostocales , oscillatoriales  and gloeobacterales , in some chroococcales , but not in prochlorales  even in those whose genome is fully sequenced. this finding, along with the viability of ftn6-depleted mutants  <cit> , suggests that other cell division factors functionally overlap with ftn <dig> in cytokinesis. alignment of all ftn <dig> amino-acids sequences identified by blast  revealed a single conserved region encompassed within the first  <dig> first amino-acids of syn <dig> ftn <dig> . this  <dig> amino-acids-long domain , termed here fnd for ftn <dig> n-terminal domain, is bipartite with the first  <dig> amino-acids  poorly conserved and the  <dig> remaining ones  characterized by the w-x3-a-x2-e-x4-g-r-y-x3-s-x4-l-x2-w consensus . the high degree of conservation of fnd in ftn <dig> orthologs suggests that this domain plays an important part of the function of ftn <dig> in cell division.

fnd is related to the dnad-like domain
interrogation of protein domain databases did not allow identification of any fnd-related domain . conversely, psi-blast searches of the ncbi non-redundant database using the syn <dig> fnd sequence as query identified significant hits for the alignment of this sequence with its orthologs and, interestingly, with members of the dnad protein family. dnad sequences that were reported from the 3th psi-blast iteration share low, typically less than 20% identity, but significant similarities with ftn <dig> orthologs . for instance, the psi-blast returned alignments with highly significant e-values between syn <dig> fnd and several members of the dnad-like family . dnad consists of two domains with distinct biochemical properties  <cit> . the n-terminal domain is involved in the oligomerization of the protein and interactions with dnaa, while the c-terminus, listed in the pfam database as the dnad-like domain , binds dna  <cit> . very interestingly, the sequence similarity we observed between the ftn <dig> orthologs and the dnad family is restricted to the dnad-like domain , suggesting a dna-binding activity for fnd.

modelling fnd
the belonging of fnd to the dnad-like domain family was further supported by fold recognition techniques. indeed, submission of each fnd domains to the phyre server constantly returned the two dnad structures currently deposited in pdb as best hits, i.e. the dnad-like domain of the replication proteins from streptococcus mutans  and from enterococcus faecalis . dnad-like domains reported from the phyre search share low but noticeable similarities with all fnd tested , suggesting structural similarities between fnd and the dnad-like domain. then, streptococcus mutans dnad-like domain has been included in the alignment shown in figure  <dig>  as expected for proteins sharing a low level of sequence identity, we noticed that the nature of the hydrophobic residues conserved in dnad-like domains  was not preserved in fnd . by contrast, their positions were highly conserved. the high degree of conservation  of the hydrophobic pattern between fnd and dnad-like domain strongly argues in favour of a similar fold. this is particularly evident for the helices  <dig> and  <dig>  in which the hydrophobic pattern is not only conserved in position , but is also highly similar, particularly the two alanines of the third helix  and the leucine and the tyrosine  at the extreme c-terminus of the fourth helix .

based on these results and the alignment shown in figure  <dig>  we constructed a homology 3d-model of syn <dig> fnd with modeller  <cit>  normalized dope z-score: - <dig> ). overall model quality assessed by prosa-web returned a z-score of - <dig> , which is in agreement with the z-scores of all experimentally determined chains currently deposited in the pdb database. most of the hydrophobic positions of fnd conserved in the dnad-like domain  are buried within the structure , emphasizing their importance for structure stability and/or folding. note that two hydrophobic positions conserved in dnad-like domains , but missing in fnds, are not buried in the dnad-like domains structure  and, hence, are probably not required for the folding of this domain. the highly conserved g58r59y <dig>  <dig> motif that is specific for fnds , localizes in a loop between the helices h <dig> and h <dig> . the tyrosine is buried within the structure, whereas the glycine and the two basic amino-acids are exposed on the surface of fnd. consurf-based mapping of the evolutionarily conserved residues exposed on the surface of the syn <dig> fnd domain  <cit>   show that g <dig>  r <dig> and k <dig> residues cluster with f <dig> and d <dig> from the first helix, e <dig>  l <dig> and y <dig> from the third helix and s <dig> from the fourth helix. all these residues are either strictly or functionally conserved  and hence, could be engaged in ftn6-specific interactions.

functional prediction for ftn6
so far, dnad-like proteins have only been found in some low g+c content gram positive bacteria and their associated phages  <cit> , where they exhibit pleiotropic functions all related with dna metabolism. for instance, dnad was shown to be involved in initiation of chromosome and plasmid replication  <cit> , sporulation  <cit> , dna repair  <cit>  and recombination  <cit> . furthermore, the dnad-related protein from the thermophilic bacteriophage gbsv <dig> exhibits an unspecific nuclease activity  <cit> . the exact function of the dnad-like domain in these processes remains unclear, but the dnad-like domain from b. subtilis was found to exhibit dna-binding and dna-remodelling activities  <cit> . altogether, these data strongly suggest that the dnad-like domain does not define a common structural fold occurring in functionally unrelated proteins, but rather that the dnad-like domain-containing proteins, including ftn <dig>  share common functions involving dna.

what is the function of ftn6? fnd could suggest a function in dna replication for ftn <dig>  however, this hypothesis is unlikely as ftn6-depleted mutants do not appear to affect chromosome replication and do not produce anucleate cells  <cit> . furthermore, the n-terminal extension in dnad proteins, which interacts with dnaa  <cit> , is missing in ftn <dig> orthologs . alternatively, ftn <dig> could function in the cross talk between chromosome replication and cell division, a fundamental biological process not yet investigated in cyanobacteria. in most bacteria, both processes are intimately co-ordinated, as formation and placement of the future division septum is regulated by nucleoid occlusion and only occurs after replication of a significant portion of the chromosome  <cit> . by contrast, z-ring can assemble at nucleoid-occupied sites and nucleoid separation occurs during z-ring constriction in cyanobacteria  <cit> . this lack of nucleoid occlusion supposes an efficient mechanism to segregate chromosome trapped at the midcell during z-ring constriction. it has recently been proposed that ftn <dig> could be involved in chromosome segregation in synechococcus pcc <dig>  <cit> . how ftn <dig> is functionally connected to chromosome segregation remains unknown. nevertheless, identification of the putative dna-binding domain, fnd, strongly supports the involvement of ftn <dig> in this pathway and its interplay with cell division.

to test this hypothesis, we reasoned that defective chromosomal segregation should generates dna damages thereby increasing the sensitivity of the cells to dna damaging agents. as expected, we found that the ftn6-depleted mutant we recently constructed  <cit>  is significantly more sensitive to uv rays than the wild-type strain . together, our findings strengthen both the functional relationship between dnad-like domain-containing proteins and dna metabolism, and the potential function of ftn <dig> at the interface between dna replication and cell division.

CONCLUSIONS
although depletion of ftn <dig> leads to cell division defects, the molecular function of this cynobacterial-specific divisome component remained unclear. sequence alignment of ftn <dig> orthologs beforehand identified by blast allowed us to uncover a new conserved domain localized within the n-terminus of the proteins. combining several approaches, we then shown that this domain, designated here as fnd, exhibits sequence and structure similarities with the dnad-like domains found in several factors involved in dna metabolism. the structure similarities between fnd and dnad-like domains together with the sensitivity of the ftn6-depleted mutant to uv rays, led us to propose that ftn <dig> is functionally linked to dna metabolism, possibly playing a role at the interface between dna replication and cell division. whether this function involves or not other cell division factors and what is  the dna target of ftn <dig> remain to be determined.
