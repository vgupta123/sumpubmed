BACKGROUND
many organisms have the ability to enter a temporary state of suspended animation before resuming the normal progression of life. various terms describe the phenomenon in specific situations in nature:  embryonic diapause, in which an embryo’s development is temporarily arrested during early ontogeny  <cit> ;  torpor, when body temperature and metabolic rate in endothermic animals are significantly reduced during certain times of the day  <cit> ;  hibernation or multiday torpor, as utilized by various animals to escape harsh winter conditions  <cit> ;  aestivation, when multiday torpor occurs in hot or dry seasons in warm climates  <cit> ; and  cryptobiosis, which entails a temporary absence of measurable metabolic activity  <cit> . in this study, we will use the term “diapause” when it occurs during embryonic development. other terms sometimes used to describe this phenomenon in kmar are “delayed hatching” or “embryonic quiescence”.

diapause was first described in roe deer in  <dig>  where blastocyst development and subsequent implantation in the uterus were delayed for 4– <dig> months  <cit> . similar phenomena have since been discovered in more than  <dig> species of mammals  <cit> . remarkably, mammalian embryonic diapause can last up to 90 % of the total gestational period  <cit> . another form of diapause is displayed by some egg-laying fishes in which embryonic hatching can be delayed for a year or more. such fish may display any of three different types of diapause: diapause i, occurring during the dispersed-cell phase of early ontogeny; diapause ii, occurring mid-somite embryogenesis; and diapause iii, occurring just prior to hatching  <cit> .

whereas the role of environmental cues in triggering diapause in killifish or more generally in vertebrates is well established  <cit> , biological mechanisms underlying the phenomenon have yet to be elucidated. for example, there is no consensus on how patterns of gene expression change during diapause. this problem promised to resolve following two major breakthroughs in the measurement of gene expression:  cdna microarray technology in the mid-1990s and  next generation sequencing  based rna-sequencing  technology in the mid-2000s  <cit> . indeed, about  <dig> studies used cdna microarrays or rna-seq to assay biological samples undergoing some form of suspended animation, and many more papers have addressed the diapause syndrome more generally. rna-seq is superior to cdna microarray in that it allows:  the capture of whole-genome expression ;  execution without prior knowledge of annotated genes; and  the detection and quantification of low-abundance genes or those with higher-fold changes of expression  <cit> . the use of rna-seq to determine genes with distinct levels of expression during diapause previously has been confined to invertebrates  .

to address this issue, we take advantage of the unique mating/reproductive system of the mangrove rivulus fish  - the world’s only vertebrate species that is highly inbred due to consistent self-fertilization . we generate isogenic lineages for transcriptomic dissection of one form of diapause. in this hermaphroditic species, selfing repeated across successive generations leads to a rapid decay of heterozygosity and to the rise of isogenic lines that are effectively “clonal”  <cit> . in captivity, kmar survives well in 25 ppt saltwater, where >90 % of kmar embryos enter diapause at stage  <dig>  . in kmar, the average duration of embryonic stages 1– <dig> is 24 days. however, in the laboratory we regularly observe kmar embryos remaining in stage  <dig>  for up to  <dig>  months. we suggest that kmar offers an excellent model to understand the biology of diapause because of its genetic homogeneity, simple rearing environment, translucent externally developing embryos, and relatively straightforward form of diapause. here, we report the use of next generation sequencing and rna-seq to distinguish the kmar diapause transcriptome from those of pre-diapause and post-diapause  embryos . since a kmar genome sequence was not publicly available, we sequenced the whole genome of this species. we then built de novo genome assemblies to serve as a genomic reference for the rna-seq data. we also built de novo transcriptome assemblies to further capture and validate the rna-seq data. differentially expressed genes unique to diapause in kmar are herein identified and discussed.fig.  <dig> images of diapause or hatched kmar embryos. a each kmar embryo enters diapause at stage  <dig>  which is marked by the diminished presence of nutritional oil droplets . any prolongation of embryonic stage  <dig> beyond 24 days is considered diapause. b kmar embryos can either enter diapause or hatch 



RESULTS
mapping of kmar rna-seq reads to known reference genomes
by using tophat software  <cit> , we found that less than 10 % of kmar rna-seq reads could be mapped against the annotated genomes of humans, mice, and several fishes  . to increase the number of mapped reads, we sequenced the whole kmar genome and built a de novo reference genome using abyss software  <cit> . the genome size was determined to be 642 mb . two additional references were built from rna-seq reads using trans-abyss and trinity software  <cit> . more than 89 % of the rna-seq reads were mapped against these three kmar references . the references were used as templates to identify transcripts. a computational program called “tuxedo suite” was utilized to identify, quantitate, and calculate differential transcript abundance between diapause and pre- or post-diapause rna samples   <cit> .table  <dig> alignment of kmar rna-seq reads against various reference genomes

fig.  <dig> optimization of kmar de novo genome assemblies. raw reads for pair-ended kmar wgs were assembled at various k-mer values to build a de novo genome. the graph shows a positive correlation between higher k-mer values and kmar genome size. a similar correlation was found for n <dig>  but peaked at k =  <dig>  thus, a kmar genome with the highest n <dig> value  that yielded a genome size of  <dig> ,823 bp was selected to serve as a reference genome for the rna-seq data analyses. 



mitochondrial housekeeping genes had high and stable levels of gene expression across developmental stages
we found that the level of expression of mitochondrial housekeeping genes was high and consistent across the three developmental stages surveyed in kmar  = ~ <dig> , rpkm: reads per kilobase per million mapped reads). these mitochondrial genes include cytochrome oxidase, ribosomal rnas, atpase, and nadh dehydrogenase. the fact that the expression of such housekeeping genes was not affected by developmental stage makes comparison of the expression of other genes straightforward.fig.  <dig> mitochondrial housekeeping gene expression. the graph shows  <dig> highly abundant kmar mitochondrial transcripts that were identified from the de novo genome  assembly



genes with distinct levels of expression in diapause constitute a minority of surveyed genes
we observed that >97 % of the surveyed gene transcripts were detected in all kmar samples , including pre-diapause, three diapause replicates, and post-diapause. of these detected transcripts, only  <dig>  % were up- and down-regulated in diapause compared to both pre- and post-diapause. most of these latter transcripts had lengths between  <dig> and 4000 nt and with expression abundances in the range  <dig>  < log10 <  <dig>  . when diapause transcripts were compared to pre-diapause transcripts, the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes were approximately equal. however, for 67 % of surveyed genes, the level of gene expression in diapause was down-regulated compared to post-diapause .table  <dig> the percentages of transcripts that exist in various developmental stages of kmar fish

our transcriptome profiling identified three genes  that had higher expression in diapause than in both pre- and post-diapause in all three references . conversely, three other genes  were found to have lower expression in diapause than in both pre- and post-diapause .

discussion
environmental cues are known to contribute to the induction and termination of diapause in fishes, but any gene expression changes associated with the phenomenon are less well understood. here we used ngs technologies to characterize patterns of gene expression during diapause in the world’s only vertebrate species that normally reproduces as a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite. isogenic sets of kmar embryos were screened for gene-expression profiles during diapause and compared against pre-diapause embryos and post-diapause larvae. to our knowledge, this is the first such study of naturally occurring diapause in any vertebrate species. thus, massively parallel genetic expression analyses of vertebrate diapause via ngs-based rna-seq are unavailable for comparison with the current study.

nevertheless, several diapause studies using an earlier technology  can provide some useful perspectives. by using microarrays,  <dig>  expression sequence tags  were obtained from a time-course analysis of the mummichog fish , including embryos with delayed hatching due to desiccation  <cit> . the individual f. heteroclitus genes identified were different than those reported in the current study. however, the ontologies of various genes involved in energy metabolism, cellular stress response, cytoskeleton, ion regulation, extracellular matrices, transcriptional control, and growth may share some degree of similarity with those reported here  <cit> . for invertebrates, several studies using rna-seq were published recently . again, particular genes found to be differentially regulated during diapause are not in obvious agreement with those identified in the current study. it may seem counterintuitive to observe that diapause occurs broadly across such animal taxa, yet few if any of the genes associated with the phenomenon were reportedly identical.

however, when we compare functional clusters of diapause genes , we find some degree of similarity as exemplified by the following two summaries:  up-regulated transcripts during diapause in a leafcutting bee  were involved in oxidative stress, neural activity, development, immune response, and ion homeostasis  <cit> ; and  differentially expressed diapause genes in a mosquito  were involved in the cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and dna replication  <cit> . similar statements apply to our current study of kmar. overall, we have identified  <dig> functional clusters of genes associated with diapause in kmar. within a particular cluster , we found that multiple genes were differentially regulated during diapause. another example involves cardiac muscle related genes that on average were up-regulated in diapause over both pre- and post-diapause . similarly, genes related to the immune system were up-regulated in diapause over pre-diapause . conversely, numerous gene clusters were down-regulated in diapause versus post-diapause . examples include clusters involved in extracellular matrices, respiration or energy metabolism, cellular or enzymatic processes, hormones, cytoskeleton, toxin-like, ion binding, and development-related functions. our results clearly provide evidence that after diapause is terminated, such gene clusters are activated beyond levels that were expressed during diapause.

CONCLUSIONS
kryptolebias marmoratus offers a strong model for understanding patterns of gene expression during diapause. our study highlights the importance of using a combination of genome and transcriptome assemblies as references for ngs-based rna-seq analyses. for example, one gene cluster that proved to be up-regulated in kmar diapause over both pre-diapause and post-diapause was related to cardiac function. several other gene clusters important for various functions were on average similar in diapause and pre-diapause. however, numerous genes and gene clusters were down-regulated in diapause compared to post-diapause, suggesting that lower gene expression during delayed development is emblematic of the diapause phenomenon. three individual diapause genes  were highly up-regulated in diapause versus both pre-diapause and post-diapause. as for all identified diapause genes, in the future studies it will be critical to link various levels of rna expression with the functional roles of the coded products.
