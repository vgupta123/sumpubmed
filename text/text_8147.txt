BACKGROUND
sunflower rust, caused by puccinia helianthi schw., is a widespread disease of sunflower  throughout the world and may cause significant yield losses and loss of seed quality. p. helianthi is an obligate pathogen and completes its life cycle on sunflower. although p. helianthi is a pathogen of great economic importance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in its pathogenicity and host specificity.

pathogen secretory proteins and host plant defense interactions involve complex signal exchanges at the plant surface and at the interface between the pathogen and the host  <cit> . plant pathogens are endowed with a special ability to interfere with physiological, biochemical, and morphological processes of the host plants through a diverse array of extracellular effectors. these are present or active at the intercellular interface or delivered inside the host cell to reach their cellular target and facilitate infection or trigger defense responses . thus, genes encoding extracellular proteins have a higher probability of being involved in virulence.

many avr genes encoding secreted proteins were identified from haustoria-forming pathogens, such as avrl <dig>  avrm, avrp <dig>  and avrp <dig> in flax rust caused by melampsora lini  <cit> , avrpi-ta and avrpiz-t in rice blast magnaporthe grisea  <cit> , avr1b- <dig> in stem and root rot of soybean phytophthora sojae  <cit> , avr3a in potato late blight p. infestans  <cit> , and atr <dig> and atr <dig> in downy mildew of arabidopsis caused by hyaloperonospora parasitica  <cit> ; all of which exhibit pathogenic functions during pathogen infection. in addition, some cell wall degrading enzymes  produced by pathogens are secretory proteins, such as the wood xylanase xyn <dig> and xyn <dig> of m. grisea  <cit> , and pectinlyase pmr <dig> of erysiphe cichoracearum  <cit> . some virulence-related proteins, such as gas <dig> and gas <dig>   <cit> , hydrophobic protein mpg <dig>  <cit> , tetraspanin-like protein pls <dig>  <cit>  and chitin binding protein cbp <dig> of rice blast  <cit>  are in the same category.

amino terminal signal peptides are responsible for transporting the virulent factors  <cit> . the n-terminal signal peptides can be classified into four types based on recognition sequences of signal peptidases. the first class is composed of “typical” signal peptides, which are cleaved by one of the various type i spases of bacillus subtilis  and most secretory proteins with this signal peptide are secreted into the extracellular environment. this group also includes signal peptides with a so-called twin-arginine motif  that are transported via the twin-arginine translocation pathway . in bacteria, the tat translocase is found in the cytoplasmic membrane and exports proteins to the cell envelope or to the extracellular space  <cit> . the second class of signal peptides are lipoproteins cleaved by the lipoprotein-specific  spase of b. subtilis   <cit> . secretory proteins with the aforementioned signal peptides are transported via the general secretion pathway   <cit> . the third class constitutes prepilin-like proteins cleaved by the prepilin-specific spase comc and the fourth class of signal peptides consists of ribosomally synthesized bacteriocin and pheromone  <cit> . these signal peptides lack a hydrophobic h-domain and they can be removed from the mature protein by a subunit of the abc transporter or by specific spases.

with the development of molecular biology, large scale genome and transcriptome sequencing has been used as an effective method for discovering gene expression profiles and novel genes. several computer-based prediction algorithms have been used to predict the secretomes from many microbial species, such as candida albicans  <cit> , p. infestans  <cit> , saccaromyces cerevisiae  <cit> , agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit> , fusarium graminearum  <cit> , neurospora crassa  <cit> , verticillium dahliae  <cit> , aspergillus oryzae  <cit> , puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici  <cit> , and colletotrichum graminicola  <cit> . these predicted secretomes provide a basis for further investigations using wet-lab procedures or more in-depth computational comparisons of relevant data sets.

an examination of the pathogenesis-related secretome of p. helianthi is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of pathogen-host interaction. here, we generated a high-throughput transcriptome analysis of proteins containing a signal peptide. we analyzed a total of  <dig>  orfs of the p. helianthi transcriptome using signalp v <dig> , tmhmm v <dig> , targetp v <dig> , tatp v <dig>  and big-pi predictor bioinformatics tools to identify secretory proteins.

methods
isolates and culture conditions
rust-infected sunflower leaves were collected in paper bags seperately, air dried at room temperature for 24 h and then spores from mature uredial pustules were brushed off the leaves and stored at 4–5 °c. the collected inocula were inoculated on universal susceptible line  <dig>  after 10– <dig> days urediospores of a single pustule were used inoculating two weeks old susceptible plants to produce purified isolates. subsequently, fresh urediniospores of each isolate were collected from rusted leaves by flicking leaves against parchment paper, and then fresh spores were dried for 3 days in a desiccator and stored individually in the refrigerator at 80 °c below zero. in this experiment, the transcriptome data were obtained from p. helianthi isolate sy.

puccinia helianthi transcriptomic data sets
we constructed a p. helianthi reference transcriptome for different growing stage urediniospores . the cdna library was sequenced on the illumina hiseq™  <dig>  for the assembly library, raw reads were filtered to remove those containing an adapter and reads with more than 5% unknown nucleotides. low quality reads were also removed, in which the percentage of low q-value  bases was more than 20%. clean reads were de novo assembled by the trinity program yielding  <dig>  transcripts with a mean size of 1394 bp. sequence data has been uploaded to the short read archive  of the national center for biotechnology information ; accession number srp <dig>  the secretory proteins were predicted according to the n-terminal amino acid sequences of  <dig>  orfs .

prediction and validation of excretory/secretory  proteins
orfs fulfilling the following four criteria were defined as the computational secretome:  the orf contains an n-terminal signal peptide;  the orf has no transmembrane domains;  the orf has no gpi-anchor site; and  the sequence does not contain the localization signal, which may target mitochondria or other intracellular organelles.

table  <dig> summarizes the bioinformatic tools used in this study. signalp v <dig> , tmhmm v <dig> , targetp v <dig> , protcomp v <dig>  and big-pi predictor tools were employed to identify expected secretory proteins of p. helianthi. signalp predicts classical secretory proteins in eukaryotes and a truncation protein sequence at  <dig> amino acids as filters. the standard was l = − <dig> - <dig> *  + <dig> *  and l >  <dig> for predicting signal peptide proteins. targetp allowed the prediction of mitochondrial proteins with a cut-off of  <dig>  for mitochondrial proteins and  <dig>  for proteins in other locations. transmembrane proteins were predicted with tmhmm  with default options. the putative proteins generated from the transcriptome were initially analyzed by signalp to predict classical secretory proteins on the basis of a d-score greater than  <dig> . the proteins identified were then analyzed with tmhmm to screen for classical secretory proteins without transmembrane segments. proteins that passed the first two steps were then evaluated by targetp to identify mitochondrial proteins. once mitochondrial proteins were identified, the remaining secretory proteins were examined and their sub-cellular localization was predicted with protcomp. those assigned to extracellular  categories were considered pathogenic secretory proteins.table  <dig> the bioinformatic tools adopted for the prediction of secretory proteins from puccinia helianthi transcriptome

analysis of signal peptide sequences
in order to further examine the length of signal peptide sequences, the secretory proteins obtained from the previous step were analyzed using custom perl script. lipoprotein signal peptide prediction was done with lipop v <dig> , which was able to distinguish among lipoproteins , spasei-cleaved proteins, cytoplasmic proteins, and transmembrane proteins  <cit> . signal peptides with an rr-motif were selected by tatp v <dig>  and homology prediction of those signal peptide sequences was evaluated following alignment by clustal omega.

es proteins annotation
predicted es proteins were annotated with interproscan and gene ontology  terms for protein domain and family classification  <cit> . go term enrichment analysis was performed using the david bioinformatics resource  <cit> . kaas  performed functional annotation by blast search against the manually curated kegg database  <cit>  and provided insight into brite functional hierarchies and kegg pathway maps  <cit> . the es proteins were independently assessed for homology matches against ncbi’s non-redundant protein database and for orthologs against the cluster of orthologous groups of proteins  database using blast with permissive  search strategies. finally, the es proteins were predicted to have pathogenic function by blast analysis of the pathogen host interaction  database .

RESULTS
es protein prediction from the transcriptome data set of p. helianthi
a total of  <dig>   out of  <dig>  orfs were predicted as classical secretory proteins with signalp. according to tmhmm v <dig>  tool prediction,  <dig>  proteins have two or more transmembrane helices,  <dig>  proteins have one transmembrane helix, and  <dig>  proteins lack transmembrane helices, accounting for  <dig> % among  <dig> proteins with n-terminal signal peptides. the remaining  <dig>  proteins without transmembrane helices were queried with big-pi predictor yielding  <dig> potential gpi-anchored proteins that may not be extracellularly secreted and  <dig>  non gpi-anchored proteins orfs.

targetp v <dig>  software was used to predict mitochondrial proteins. among  <dig>  proteins,  <dig>   proteins had extracellular targeting signals,  <dig>  proteins contained mitochondria targeting signals and  <dig> proteins  contained other targeting signals.

the application of protcomp v <dig>  to the remaining  <dig>  orfs yielded a total of  <dig> orfs  as es proteins  and the remaining  <dig> proteins were predicted to be transported to the mitochondria , cell membrane , nucleus , golgi , cytoplasm , endoplasmic reticulum , lysosome , peroxisome  and vacuole .

orf length of the secretory proteins from p. helianthi
to examine the orf length of the predicted secretory proteins from p. helianthi,  <dig>  p. helianthi orfs were analyzed by bioinformatics tools and  <dig>  orfs were identified as secretory proteins. among them,  <dig> proteins contained the complete orf. the longest protein was  <dig> amino acids  and the shortest one was  <dig> aa. the length of most secretory proteins  was between  <dig> and  <dig> aa. within this group,  <dig> % of them were 101– <dig> aa long. thus, we suggest most secretory proteins probably fall in the shorter length range .fig.  <dig> length distribution of puccinia helianthi orfs coding secretory proteins




characteristics of signal peptides of predicted secretory proteins in p. helianthi
the analysis of the signal peptides of  <dig> predicted secretory proteins reveals the length of the signal peptide ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> aa  and most signal peptides  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> aa. signal peptides with  <dig> aa length, however, were the most abundant, accounting for  <dig> % . the alignment of all  <dig> signal peptide sequences was done by clustal omega. the homology among the signal peptide sequences was low with the highest similarity  observed between signal peptide sequence ku <dig> and ku <dig>  no protein with an rr-motif signal peptide was found by tatp v <dig>  while  <dig> proteins contained secretory pathway signal peptides cleavable by spasei, and  <dig> proteins harbored lipoprotein signal peptides cleavable by spaseii. n-terminal transmembrane helices were found in  <dig> proteins and  <dig> of them could be localized to cytoplasmic organelles. thus, most of the secretory proteins were determined to be secreted through the general secretion pathway .fig.  <dig> length distribution of puccinia helianthi signal peptides




amino acid composition of signal peptides of predicted secretory proteins in p. helianthi
the distribution of  <dig> amino acids in the signal peptide was statistically analyzed and the frequencies of amino acid residues in a descending order were: l - s - t - r - a - i - c - v - f - e - k - m - g - n - q - p - y - h - w - d. hydrophobic amino acid leucine  showed an appearance rate of  <dig> %, followed by serine  as  <dig> % . the occurrence of the negatively charged hydrophilic amino acid aspartate  is the lowest, accounting for  <dig> %.fig.  <dig> percentage of  <dig> amino acid residues in puccinia helianthi secretory protein signal peptides




in general, the c-terminal region of signal peptides contains an enzyme recognition site. based on this cleavage site, the amino acids of negative direction were named as − <dig>  − <dig>  and −3; those of positive direction were named as + <dig>  + <dig>  and + <dig>  between protein cutting locus positions − <dig> and + <dig>  valine  is most likely to occupy the position − <dig> at a frequency of  <dig> %. the frequency of serine  being at position − <dig> is  <dig> %, alanine  has a  <dig> % chance to be at position − <dig>  while  <dig> % of the time glutamine  is found in position + <dig> . interestingly, it was found that most amino acids were widely used in the range of cleavage site − <dig> to + <dig> position in sunflower rust but no h, k, or y was observed at position − <dig>  this indicates amino acids near the cleavage site are highly polymorphic in sunflower rust.table  <dig> amino acids frequency and distribution in cleavage sites of signal peptide of secretory proteins




annotation of excretory/secretory  of p. helianthi
all es proteins identified were searched for sequence homology against our non-redundant dataset using blast. it was found that  <dig>  computationally predicted es proteins shared similarities with known proteins. a total of  <dig> es proteins could be annotated in gene ontology  and were classified into  <dig> functional groups, including  <dig> groups in biological process, seven in cellular component, and six in molecular function . within biological process, “metabolic process”  with  <dig> es proteins and “cellular process”  with  <dig> es proteins were predominant. in the category of cellular component, the three main groups were “extracellular region” , “cell” , and “cell part” . the categories “catalytic activity”  and “binding”  were most common in molecular function, represented by  <dig> and  <dig> es proteins, respectively.fig.  <dig> gene ontology annotation of the secretory proteins of puccinia helianthi. the best hits were aligned to the go database, and  <dig> putative secretory proteins were assigned to at least one go term. most consensus sequences were grouped into three major functional categories and  <dig> sub-categories




es proteins were subjected to go enrichment analysis. the  <dig> top significant enriched go terms are shown in table  <dig>  the hydrolase activity, hydrolyzing o-glycosyl compounds , hydrolase activity , hydrolase activity, acting on glycosyl bonds , carbohydrate metabolic process , peptidase activity, acting on l-amino acid peptides , extracellular region , peptidase activity , serine-type endopeptidase activity , serine-type peptidase activity  and serine hydrolase activity  are significantly enriched. these proteins included glycoside hydrolase, glucoamylase, phosphatase, phosphoesterase, lipase, cysteine peptidase, peptidase, cysteine-rich secretory protein, etc. pathway associations were established for  <dig>  es proteins with the majority belonging to metabolism. the predicted es protein dataset is comprised of important biological molecules, including enzymes, the spliceosome and the ribosome .table  <dig> the  <dig> top go terms significantly enriched for secretory proteins

go enrichment analysis was carried out using the hypergeometric test with a value threshold of  <dig> . most significantly enriched terms were selected according to their p-value






function prediction of predicted secretory proteins in p. helianthi
out of  <dig> secretory proteins queried against our non-redundant dataset using blast,  <dig> had functional descriptions, of which  <dig> had clear functional descriptions and  <dig> were predicted as hypothetical, conserved hypothetical, uncharacterized, or unnamed proteins. the querying of  <dig> secretory proteins against the cog database was performed for functional classification . a total of  <dig> proteins could be assigned to the cog classification, of which  <dig>  potentially participated in the transport and metabolism of carbohydrates , followed by  <dig> % involved in post-translational modifications, protein turnover, and molecular chaperones . proteins participating in inorganic ion transport and metabolism; replication, recombination and repair; transcription; amino acid transport and metabolism accounted for only  <dig> %, respectively .  <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins had annotations based on interpro, of which  <dig>  were hydrolases, including  <dig> peptidases,  <dig> glycoside hydrolases, seven esterases, five phosphatases, four each ribonuleases, and polysaccharide deacetylases, three each alpha/beta hydrolases, and glucanases .fig.  <dig> cog classifications of predicted secretory proteins in the transcriptome of puccinia helianthi. all  <dig> putative proteins showing significant homology to those in the cog database were functionally classified into  <dig> families. note: p, inorganic ion transport and metabolism; l, replication, recombination and repair; k, transcription; e, amino acid transport and metabolism; c, energy production and transformation; u, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport; s, function unknown; m, biosynthesis of cell and outer membrane; j, translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis; q, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, transport and catabolism; r, general function prediction; g, the transport and metabolism of carbohydrates; o, post-translational modification, protein turnover and molecular chaperones; i, lipoid metabolism






peptidase, glycoside hydrolase, pectinesterase, polysaccharide deacetylase, pectate lyase and glucanosyltransferase were found possibly to be related to cell wall degradation. nine proteins contained an md-2-related lipid-recognition  domain, six contained a lipocalin/cytosolic fatty-acid binding domain, and three contained a tyrosinase copper-binding domain. six were annotated as lipocalin, four as the proteinase inhibitor i <dig> cystatin, four as apolipoprotein, three each as ribosomal protein, one as thaumatin, and two were annotated as the cysteine-rich allergen v5/tpx-1-related secretory protein. the functions of most predicted secretory proteins are still unknown.

discussion
protein is the major functional component of living organisms. many pathogenic microbes can secrete proteins into host cells to promote their infection process  <cit> . therefore, analysis of secretory proteins in the pathogen genome or transcriptome will help reveal pathogenic mechanisms. according to the signal peptide hypothesis  <cit> , secretory protein destination is determined by its signal peptide. the signal peptide will be cleaved off when the protein reaches its destination. a free online program, signalp, has been developed that accurately identifies eukaryotic signal peptides  <cit> . an analysis of  <dig> known secretory protein and  <dig> other proteins of c. albicans by signalp v <dig>  showed that the putative results obtained were credible  <cit> .

signal peptides structures from various proteins commonly contain a positively charged n-region, a hydrophobic h-region and a neutral polar c-region. in the c-terminal region, helix breaking proline and glycine residues and small uncharged residues which are often found at the positions − <dig> and − <dig> determine the signal peptide cleavage site  <cit> . in p. helianthi, valine was observed more frequently  at position − <dig>  alanine was most likely to be at position − <dig> , while histidine, lysine, tyrosine were not observed at this position. this indicates amino acids at − <dig> and − <dig> positions are relatively conserved, which might guarantee the recognition accuracy of signal peptidases.

numerous algorithms are freely available for the prediction of protein structures, functions and interactions. analyses of entire s. cerevisiae genome databases have included identification of gpi-anchored proteins  <cit> , a prediction of protein sub-cellular localization  <cit>  and a prediction of the “typical” secretory protein with internet-based software signalp v <dig> , targetp v <dig> , big-pi predictor and tmhmm v <dig>   <cit> . bioinformatics approaches made the large scale prediction and analysis of es proteins of helminths possible, which included a comprehensive blast analysis to annotate the function of the es proteins  <cit> . thus, one approach to rapidly analyze the entire p. helianthi transcriptome and to predict its secretome is to utilize a wide range of appropriate and efficient bioinformatics tools.

after screening  <dig>  orfs of transcriptome data,  <dig>  were predicted as secretory proteins. these putative secretory proteins were small proteins. up to  <dig> % of these secretory proteins were between  <dig> and  <dig> aa with signal peptide length between  <dig> and  <dig> aa. the short length of amino acids in secretory proteins is likely due to the reference genome of p. helianthi is not available and the unavoidable limitations of de novo transcriptome reconstruction. in signal peptides, the frequency of leucine , a hydrophobic amino acid, reached  <dig> %. abundant hydrophobic amino acids may be relevant to the secretion of secretory proteins and their subsequent destination. most of the amino acids in signal peptides were aliphatic, which are mostly neutral amino acids or hydroxyl or sulfur amino containing amino acids. these amino acids may be important for physiochemical properties of the secretory proteins, which can make the signal peptide cross the plasma membrane easier and enhance signal guidance function. prediction result showed most of the signal peptides of  <dig> putative secretory proteins were cleaved by spi. the majority of the secretory proteins in p. helianthi are likely transported via the general secretory pathway. furthermore, no signal peptide contained the rr-motif, which may indicate the tat pathway does not exist or has minor roles in p. helianthi.

signal peptides can guide the secretory proteins to subcellular locations, and play a key role in the process of metabolism. signal peptide sequence analysis of all  <dig> secretory proteins showed sequence similarity is low, which indicates higher sequence variability, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . the low conservation might contribute to accurate positioning and specific metabolic functions of individual secretory proteins.

among the  <dig> secretory proteins, most with functional descriptions are proteins responsible for transport and metabolism of carbohydrates, which is similar to previous research on bradyrhizobium japonicum  <cit>  and rhizobium etli  <cit> . this implies a great deal of materials needed for rust pathogen development and infection may involve sugars, inorganic salt, and organic small molecules, which can be used as cofactors and to meet pathogen energy requirements. our go enrichment analysis indicated that hydrolase activity, carbohydrate metabolic process, peptidase activity were significantly enriched in the putative secretory proteins. it suggests rust pathogen p. helianthi can secrete various types of extracellular hydrolases which may include nucleases that can degrade the genetic material of the host plants and interfere with the host genetic metabolism. additional hydrolase enzymes may be responsible for cell wall degradation; thereby making the host conducive to rust pathogen colonization by destroying the host cell structure and accelerating the process of infection. in addition, the secretory proteins also contain relatively unique serine proteases and similar proteins. in fungi, serine proteases are closely linked with pathogen infection and are often used to degrade the host plant proteins  <cit> . this suggests serine proteases may also be associated with the rust infection process. cysteine peptidases  play important roles in facilitating the survival and growth of mammalian parasites  <cit> . cps found in the sunflower rust pathogen, in turn, could also be associated with virulence to the host. in addition, two cysteine-rich secretory proteins identified as calcium chelating serine proteases  <cit>  could be candidate effectors of this pathogen  <cit> . three proteins similar to effectors of p. sojae were also found that might be similarly correlated with the pathogenicity of p. helianthi. these candidate proteins may provide more insight into common pathogenesis pathways utilized by both p. sojae and p. helianthi but more experimental evidence is necessary to confirm the biological roles of p. helianthi effectors.

proteins containing the conserved ml domain are involved in lipid recognition or metabolism and are particularly important for the recognition of pathogen-related processes such as lipopolysaccharide  binding and signaling  <cit> . lps and glycoproteins have been detected in the neck region of haustoria  <cit> . proteins containing the ml domain in p. helianthi may, therefore, play a role in the recognition of host lipid-related products.

the thaumatin protein is considered a model pathogen-response protein domain for pathogenesis-related  proteins involved in systematically acquired resistance and stress responses in plants, although their precise role is unknown  <cit> . thaumatin-like secreted proteins of rust fungi may alter the plant-signalling pathway and have also been reported in the melampsora secretome  <cit> . future research into the role of thaumatin in sunflower rust infection will provide a better understanding of general and specific mechanisms of thaumatin-mediated resistance and pathogenesis.

among these  <dig> secretory proteins in p. helianthi, the majority of them were unclassified due to rust fungi are biotrophic species and require specific genes in their life. the similar results were reported in wheat rust fungus p. striiformis f. sp. tritici  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, various open source bioinformatics tools were used to predict and analyze es proteins from p. helianthi transcriptome. out of  <dig>  orfs of transcriptome data,  <dig>  were predicted as secretory proteins and most were short proteins. a blast analysis was used to annotate the function of the es proteins and provided further evidence for some proteins as candidates participating in the infection process of p. helianthi. blasting phi yielded a total of  <dig> secretory proteins that could be involved in pathogenicity and three secretory proteins were predicted to be similar to the effectors of p. sojae. therefore, this investigation provides a novel approach for identifying elicitors and pathogenic factors. it also establishes a sound foundation for understanding the structures and functions of the pathogenic factors of p. helianthi. in conclusion, our data can be used as a candidate gene resource for further computational or wet lab research to unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between sunflower and p. helianthi.
