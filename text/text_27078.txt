BACKGROUND
the extensive use of elite sires exacerbated by the large-scale exploitation of artificial insemination in cattle breeding causes important reductions in effective population size and the common spread of loss-of-function variants. this in turn is responsible for the periodic outburst of genetic defects that cause considerable economic loss and welfare issues. with the development of genome-wide snp arrays for all livestock species, it has become possible to rapidly map the underlying locus by means of autozygosity mapping to intervals that typically span  <dig> to  <dig> megabases thereby proving the inherited nature and mode of inheritance of the corresponding condition . with the advent of targeted or whole-genome next generation sequencing , it is becoming increasingly facile to identify the causative mutation, needed to develop accurate diagnostic tests, provided that the mutation is a frame-shift, nonsense, canonical splice-site, or severe missense variant. in other cases, the causative mutation may remain elusive for a considerably longer time. we show in this work how the combined use of dna and rna ngs data, may accelerate the discovery of an otherwise elusive, novel class of causative mutations.

RESULTS
arthrogryposis emerges as a new genetic defect in belgian blue cattle
we recently established an “heredo-surveillance platform” to effectively identify and control inherited defects that recurrently emerge as a result of intensive use of elite sires in belgian blue and other cattle breeds . twenty-five belgian-blue cases of a new form of arthrogryposis were referred to this platform in  <dig> alone. affected calves were all characterized by arthrogryposis  of the four limbs, severe scoliosis , and a stocky head with macroglossy and impaired tooth eruption. a majority of cases suffered from cleft palate  and upper lip , omphalocele  and corneal clouding  . several dams developed metritis and peritonitis, caused by hydrops  of the fetal membranes due to impaired fetal swallowing.figure  <dig> lethal arthrogryposis syndrome clinical spectrum. a. generalized arthrogryposis. b. brachygnathism and macroglossy. c. impaired tooth eruption. d. omphalocoele. e. corneal clouding. f. hard cleft palate.

the  <dig> cases traced back, on sire and dam side, to the artificial insemination  sire kalimine du barsy fontaine, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. we therefore genotyped  <dig> cases with the bovine snp <dig> beadchip  to perform a genome-wide association study . we used the genotypes from  <dig> belgian blue ai sires, obtained with the bovine hd  beadchip , as controls. the analysis was restricted to  <dig>  snps shared by both arrays, and conducted with glascow as previously described  <cit> . this yielded a single genome-wide significant signal  on chromosome  <dig> . it resulted from autozygosity of the  <dig> cases for a  <dig>  mb  identical-by-descent haplotype, hence confirming the suspected mode of inheritance .figure  <dig> genetic mapping of the mutation causing the arthrogryposis syndrome in belgian blue cattle. a. manhattan plot for the case–control gwas study. b. genotypes of  <dig> cases for a bta <dig> segment centered around the most significant gwas peak, and encompassing  <dig> snp . homozygous genotypes are shown in black or white, heterozygous genotypes in red. the presumed ancestral haplotype encompassing the mutation is underlined in yellow. the  <dig>  mb region of homozygosity shared by all cases is highlighted in red.



resequencing the whole genome of four cases identifies  <dig> candidate causative mutations
the corresponding interval is collinear with a  <dig>  mb segment of human chromosome  <dig>  and encompasses  <dig> annotated genes. as none of these would be obvious candidates, we generated paired-end libraries for four cases and re-sequenced them to average  <dig> -fold depth  on a illumina gaiix instrument as described  <cit> . equivalent genomic sequences of  <dig> healthy belgian blues that did not carry the incriminated haplotype were used as controls. sequence reads were mapped on the bostau6/umd <dig> reference genome using bwa  <cit> , and variants called with samtools  <cit> . we detected  <dig>  variants with quality score >  <dig> mapping to the  <dig>  mb interval. as expected, the four cases appeared homozygous for the  <dig> beadchip snps defining the associated haplotype. filtering against known bovine dbsnp snps and variants observed in at least one of the  <dig> controls, and demanding homozygosity for the four cases, left us with only  <dig> candidate variants . yet, none of these would alter coding sequences , or map within three base pairs from an exon-intron junction.

rnaseq reveals skipping of pigh exon  <dig> and pinpoints an intronic mutation as the likely causative variant
the findings described in the previous paragraph suggested that the causative mutation was either regulatory or affecting splicing otherwise. to pursue this hypothesis, we took advantage of available rnaseq data  from liver  and cerebral cortex  of a 60-day post fertilization belgian blue fetus shown by snp genotyping to carry the arthrogryposis risk haplotype. sequence reads were analyzed using tophat and cufflinks  <cit>  and predicted transcripts mapping to the arthrogryposis locus visualized in the igv browser  <cit> . we readily noticed skipping of the second exon of approximately half  of the pigh  transcripts . to verify whether this observation might be related to the arthrogryposis condition we extracted rna from available skeletal muscle and kidney of an affected calf and an age-matched control, and performed rt-pcr using primers located in exon  <dig> and  <dig> of the pigh gene. while we obtained a unique band of expected 593-bp size for the control, the only band obtained from the case rna was 377~bp . sequencing of the corresponding rt-pcr products revealed the expected pigh exon 1-2- <dig> sequence for the controls, yet two distinct sequences for the case. the most abundant  form corresponded to the skipping of exon  <dig>  while the minor  form was - in addition to missing exon  <dig> – devoid of the first aag triplet of exon  <dig> . note the 3′ ag end of this lysine codon susceptible to act as a cryptic acceptor splice-site. this form was also observed in five rnaseq reads, validating this finding .figure  <dig> alternative splicing at the pigh locus and private c211-10c > g intronic variation. a. screen capture of an igv output from liver rnaseq data of a heterozygote mutant embryo aligned on the bovine genomic reference sequence at the pigh locus . the four exons appear as stacks of grey reads and splicing is schematically denoted by thin blue lines. complete skipping of pigh exon  <dig> in ~ half of the transcripts is noticeable . pigh intron/exon annotation and the two alternative splicing events are represented by dashed red  and blue  lines. b. screen capture of an igv output displaying  on the positive strand , a private g to c mutation  from genomic dna sequence reads of four pooled homozygous cases,  on the negative strand , pigh intron 1/exon  <dig> annotation showing the private mutation position at − <dig> nucleotide in the splice acceptor sequence .



interestingly, one of the  <dig> candidate mutations identified by whole genome sequencing is a c-to-g transversion located in the first intron of pigh, 10-bp upstream of the exon  <dig> junction ″211-10c > g) . the corresponding residue is located in the consensus polypyrimidine track defining canonical “gt-ag” type acceptor splice-sites , and is conserved in  <dig> of the  <dig> sequenced mammals . we developed a 5′exonuclease assay to interrogate the c211-10c > g variant and genotyped  <dig> cases,  <dig> parents and >  <dig>  healthy belgian blue animals. all cases were homozygous “gg”, and all parents “cg” as expected. six percent of the healthy belgian blues were carriers, while none were homozygous “gg” .

the clinical spectrum of arthrogryposis is compatible with severe glycosylphosphatidyl inositol  deficiency
the pigh protein is ubiquitously expressed. it is one of seven highly conserved  subunits of the complex catalyzing the first step out of eleven in the biosynthesis of the glycophosphatidyl inositol  anchor, a complex c-terminal posttranslational modification concerning >  <dig> proteins or ~ <dig> % of cellular proteins  . within the gpi-glcnac transferase complex , pigh is anchored in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum  by two trans-membrane helices , connected by a short er intra-luminal loop , and bounded by a short n-terminal  and a long c-terminal cytoplasmic tail   <cit> . deleting exon  <dig> generates a protein missing amino-acids 61– <dig>  therefore unlikely to be properly anchored in the er membrane and to be functional . in culture, cells with mutations in pigh do not display any gpi-anchored protein  surface expression . in animals, all known gpi-anchor related defects characterized by a complete lack of gpi-anchored proteins are lethal for the embryo. it is thought that this embryonic-lethal phenotype is due to the fact that several cell-to-cell adhesion molecules required for normal development and acting at specific developmental stages are gpi-anchored . the additional file  <dig> lists the known gpi-ap and their associated knock-out phenotype in mice. taken together, our results strongly suggest that the observed pigh c211-10c > g mutation causes arthrogryposis in belgian blue cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
we herein describe the identification of an intronic mutation that disrupts pigh function by causing the skipping of exon  <dig>  thereby causing a severe and lethal form of arthrogryposis in homozygous animals. we mapped the corresponding locus by performing a haplotype-based gwas, an approach that has proven successful in many instances . if the causative mutation is either a stop-gain, frameshift, splice-site variant within 2-bp from an exon-intron boundary, or a severe missense variant, its identification is often relatively straightforward. in our experience, this situation occurs approximately fifty percent of the time, which is in agreement with the data reported by  <cit> . in the other cases, the identification of the causative mutation may be considerably more arduous. in the present study, it was the concomitant generation of rnaseq data from tissue of a carrier animal that provided the clues for the identification of the causative mutation. the detection of exon skipping in an essential gene that was not observed in non-carrier animals pointed towards one of  <dig> genetically defined mutations  as being the likely causative mutation. it would have been very difficult to predict the effect of this variant, located at 10-bp from the exon-intron junction, on the splicing reaction without the information on the corresponding transcripts. our work therefore illustrates the value of the combined availability of dna and rnaseq data to rapidly identify a broader panel of disease causing mutations.

although we consider the supporting evidence to be very strong, we haven’t formally proven that skipping of exon  <dig> of the pigh gene abrogates its function and interferes with gpi-anchor biosynthesis. in human and mice, functional validation of gpi biosynthesis pathway’s defects relies on the detection of incomplete or absent cell surface expression of cd <dig>  a well-characterized gpi-anchored protein . this quantification is typically performed by facs on fresh erythrocytes. unfortunately, homozygous mutant calves are dead at birth, precluding the collection of fresh blood. producing and collecting homozygous mutant fetuses by mating carriers was beyond the scope of this study.

to the best of our knowledge, this the first report of a naturally occurring loss-of-function mutation in the pigh gene in animals. a genetic test interrogating the pigh c211-10c > g variant has been developed and offered to breeders since  <dig>  its widespread use has led to the rapid elimination of this syndrome from the belgian blue population.
