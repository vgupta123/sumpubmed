BACKGROUND
in genome projects such as the medicago sequencing initiative  <cit> , expressed sequenced tags are of great value for genome annotation because they provide evidence of expression of predicted genes, and by spliced alignment to genomic dna, they can provide support for gene structures. in instances where genome sequence is not available, est sequencing provides a first catalog of a species' gene inventory. combinations of library normalization and deep sequencing are used to maximize gene discovery. here, we examine whether the deep sequencing made cost-effective by pyrosequencing technology leads to significant new gene discovery in a normalized cdna library, and whether the short reads produced are of value in gene structure annotation and ssr identification.

 <dig> life sciences corporation, branford, ct, has developed the first dna pyrosequencing platform to employ picoliter volumes in a highly multiplexed, flow-through array capable of producing 20â€“ <dig> million bases per run. sequencing is performed on randomly fragmented dna using microbead-based pyrosequencing chemistry. this technology enables sequence data generation for large genome organisms that was previously inaccessible with conventional sequencing platforms because of prohibitive cost and throughput limitations  <cit> . the usefulness of 454-derived sequences was assessed with the specific goal of identifying new genes and improving gene predictions.

ests, are single-pass and partial sequences from cdna clones that provide a rapid and cost-effective method to analyze transcribed portions of the genome while avoiding the non coding and repetitive dna that can make up much of the genome of some crop plants. est sequencing has been shown to accelerate gene discovery including gene family identification  <cit> , large-scale expression analysis  <cit> , establishing phylogenetic relationships  <cit> , developing pcr based molecular markers  <cit> , and identifying simple sequence repeats  <cit>  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  <cit> . in both of the finished plant genomes of arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa, expressed sequences  have been invaluable  <cit>  in defining the correct components of gene structure, with spliced alignments of transcript sequences resolving partial or complete exons, splice sites, and in the case of full-length cdnas, complete gene structures. est assemblies generated using pasa  were shown to allow the automated modeling of novel genes and more than  <dig>  alternative splicing variations, as well as updates  to nearly half of the ~ <dig>  annotated protein coding genes in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . since experimental biologists are more interested in the reliability of individual predictions than in the average performance of gene predictions, it is important to have an extensive est collection to guarantee the quality of individual gene models. although large numbers of ests have been generated for many species including barley, rice, maize, sorghum, soybean, medicago and wheat, characterizations of the transcriptomes of these species are likely far from complete.

here, we examine whether the deep sequencing made cost-effective by the  <dig> technology leads to significant new gene discovery in a cdna library by comparisons with the institute for genomic research  medicago truncatula gene index  containing  <dig>  high-quality ests  <cit> . we also investigate whether the short reads produced are of value in gene structure annotation by comparisons to high quality automated gene prediction generated by the international medicago genome annotation group   <cit> .

RESULTS
the overall objective of this study was to determine if the  <dig> technology leads to significant new gene/transcript discovery in a cdna library, and whether the short reads produced by this technology are of value in gene structure annotation.

library normalization,  <dig> derived cdna sequences, assembly, functional annotation, ssrs and new transcripts/genes discovery will be discussed first, followed by an analysis of genome mapping to determine their ability to validate and update gene structures.

cdna library production
an adapter-ligated normalized cdna population was generated from rna pooled from four aerial plant tissues  of m. truncatula as described in materials and methods. this cdna  was used to construct both a plasmid library and the  <dig> library used for  <dig> sequencing. in order to address the number of full length cdnas generated from the smart technology, conventional sequencing was carried out and analyzed. a total of  <dig>  5' end reads from conventional sequencing were generated that assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences. of these,  <dig>   assembled sequences have a protein hit that contains the corresponding start codon and are thus potentially full-length. the top protein matches range between  <dig> to over  <dig> amino acids in length and would thus indicate that the predicted open reading frame generated from this library did not have any bias towards long or short protein sequences . approximately 30% of these full length cdnas do not have a full-length counterpart in the current mtgi.

 <dig> sequencing
a single  <dig> run on this sample generated  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides and a total length of  <dig> mb. in the previous section, conventional sequencing of the plasmid-based library was discussed with reference to the percentage of full length cdnas. the remainder of the analysis in this manuscript will focus on  <dig> sequencing of the normalized  cdna population. conventional sequencing on the plasmid library was performed using a plasmid-located primer close to the 5' end of the cloned cdna and thus represents the 5' ends of the cdna population generated by reverse transcription and second strand cdna synthesis. by contrast, the  <dig> library preparation involves random shearing of the normalized but un-cloned cdna population, fragment end polishing, adaptor ligation, library immobilization, fill-in reaction, single stranded dna library isolation and pyrosequencing  <cit> . the  <dig> reads therefore originate from random locations within each cdna and may have either orientation. however because the original cdna preparation involved the use of directional adapters that were subsequently used for cloning, we can also recognize the  <dig> reads that originate from the 5' and 3' ends of the cdna population by the presence of different adapter sequences and, in the case of the 3' end, also by polya tracts . searching for the directional adapters resulted in  <dig>  reads containing the 5'end adaptor while  <dig>  reads either contained the 3'end adaptor or a poly a/t tail. in addition the complete set of reads had matches to over 50% of the arabidopsis proteome. the presence of adapter sequences, poly a tracts and hits to the arabidopsis proteome indicates that the  <dig> sequences represents both good coverage both of the ends  and within the protein open reading frames.

 <dig> cdna sequence assemblies
cleaning  of these sequences resulted in a total of  <dig>  high quality reads with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides totaling  <dig> mb. after clustering and assembly using tgicl clustering utilities  <cit> ,  <dig>  sequence reads were incorporated into  <dig>  assemblies leaving  <dig>  singletons for a total of  <dig>  unique sequences. most assemblies are short  and contain few component reads . this is presumably due to both the length of the individual reads and the low coverage of the transcriptome represented in this dataset. based on the current mtgi, the transcriptome space was estimated as follows: ~ <dig>  sequences of approximately  <dig>  nucleotides equates to  <dig> mb of unique m. truncatula expressed sequence. the  <dig> mb of  <dig> cdna sequence analyzed in this study represents only  <dig>  times coverage of the transcriptome space, and therefore any attempt at clustering and assembly will not generate high levels of overlapping reads. in order to address the effectiveness of normalization of the library, a comparison was made between the top five most abundant transcripts from the mtgi and the  <dig> derived sequences. representation of the most abundant transcripts was  <dig> to  <dig> fold reduced in the normalized cdna population as compared to the collection of ests in mtgi, the vast majority of which are derived from non-normalized libraries .

uniqueness of  <dig> sequences
many plant genomes have a high proportion of repetitive sequences, and many multi-gene families. short reads from recent duplications might not be distinguishable. in order to address this,  <dig> derived sequences were compared to the mtgi with regard to their ability to map to a single location on the genome. using a threshold of 95% identity plus 95% coverage, 70% of the  <dig> unique sequences could be mapped to a unique location. similarly, 70% of the mtgi sequences could be mapped to a unique location using the same threshold of 95% identity plus 95% coverage. this demonstrates that although short,  <dig> reads can be mapped to the medicago genome, with the same confidence as longer ests.

functional annotation
gene ontology  is a controlled vocabulary of functional terms that allows coherent annotation of gene products. in order to assign putative functional roles to the medicago sequences, we used the go assignments of the arabidopsis proteome  <cit> . the medicago  <dig> and the mtgi derived unique sequences were compared with the arabidopsis proteome using blastx . top protein matches from  <dig>  arabidopsis genes was assigned to each of  <dig>  medicago  <dig> sequences. both the mtgi and  <dig> sequences were plotted side by side and in both cases, the genes cover a broad range of go categories. striking differences can be seen within the molecular function of 'response to abiotic or biotic stimulus' and 'biological process unknown as a function'. however this is not surprising since a large percentage of the libraries that were used in the mtgi were generated under abiotic or biotic stress.

comparison between  <dig> mb of  <dig> cdna sequence with  <dig> mb of randomly selected est sequence
in an attempt to compare est sequence from conventional sequencing and pyrosequencing, we randomly sampled approximately  <dig> mb of dna sequence from the available medicago ests in genbank. using the same conditions to assemble the  <dig> cdna reads and repeating the following analysis three times generates similar results as follows. cleaning  of these sequences resulted in a total of  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides. after clustering and assembly using tgicl clustering utilities  <cit> ,  <dig>  assemblies were generated leaving  <dig>  singletons for a total of  <dig> , unique sequences . not surprisingly, the individual est reads, and assemblies generated were longer on average and had higher coverage per assembly when comparisons were made with  <dig> cdna reads and assemblies . despite the much smaller number of reads, the longer est length of the individual reads increased the chance of forming contigs and increased the number of reads per assembly. strictly speaking, an ideal comparison would be to sample est reads out of the same library from which the  <dig> cdna reads were sequenced, however, no similar libraries are publicly available for m. truncatula because they were not normalized in the same way.

identification of simple sequence repeats  within  <dig> cdna sequence assemblies
a total of  <dig> unique  <dig> cdna sequences contained a ssr. among the ssrs,  <dig> are trinucleotides, followed by dinucleotides , mononucleotides  tetranucleotides , pentanucleotides , and hexanucleotides . ag/ct  is the most frequent repeat motif, followed by aag/ctt . among the ests without a mtgi hit;  <dig> sequences contained a ssr. among these ssrs,  <dig> are dinucleotides, followed by trinucleotides , mononucleotides  tetranucleotides  and pentanucleotides . randomly selected ests from the previous section generated  <dig> more sequences containing ssrs, three times more sequences with more than one ssr  and twice as many ssrs in compound formation.  probably due to the longer read and contig lengths.

comparison of  <dig> cdna aequence assemblies to the tigr medicago gene index and characterization of novel transcripts
the  <dig> cdna assemblies and singletons were searched against the tigr mtgi, containing  <dig>  high-quality ests  <cit> . approximately 70% of the  <dig> unique sequences had a blat or a blastn hit to  <dig>  mtgi sequences . from the  <dig>  assemblies and singletons  that had no match in mtgi  <dig>  had matches in a comprehensive protein database using blastx  and ~ <dig>  sequences had a blat match to one or more of  <dig> other tigr plant gene indices . the ~ <dig>  reads with matches to tigr gene indices could be condensed into  <dig> clusters based on their single best match to different parts of the same or orthologous tcs and likely represent this number of previously unobserved medicago transcripts. similarly,  <dig>  sequences that had matches in the comprehensive tigr protein database could be condensed into  <dig>  clusters based on their top protein matches.

to more clearly demonstrate that the  <dig> technology could discover new genes by deep sequencing, a comparison was made between the est sequencing coverage versus the annotated genes of medicago and lotus that are discovered. figure  <dig> shows that  <dig> derived ests contain many more gene hits for a given amount of est sequence coverage when compared to the mtgi. twice as many gene hits are found up to  <dig>  bp of est sequence coverage and thereafter the rate of gene hits slows but is always found to be substantially higher than the mtgi.

thus  <dig> sequencing has revealed many transcripts not previously detected in medicago, some of which have matches in protein or est databases. this supports the idea that deeper est sequencing using  <dig> technology will identify a larger number of expressed sequences than conventional est sequencing and is effective in revealing the expression of many rare transcripts.

mapping novel sequences to medicago genomic dna
of the  <dig>  sequences not found in mtgi,  <dig>  and  <dig>  could be mapped using blat with a threshold of 90% identity and 90% coverage and 95% identity and 95% coverage, respectively, to all available m. truncatula genome sequence in genbank . these transcripts had low levels of repeats sequences  <cit>  and are unlikely to represent sequencing errors, since alignments on the genome using lower thresholds, 60% identity and 60% coverage generated only a 10% increase in matches. at this point, it is estimated that ~50â€“60% of the medicago euchromatic gene space has been sequenced. thus the  <dig> sequences without matches to genomic dna may be derived from transcripts from the as yet unsequenced euchromatin, from expressed genes residing in the 200+ mb of heterochromatin or from contaminating nucleic acid e.g. plant bacteria or fungi, although there is no evidence for this last possibility. thus it is likely that a large fraction of the novel sequences will be useful for gene structure or expression validation in the remainder of the medicago euchromatin or as an indication of the presence of expressed genes in the heterochromatin.

use of  <dig> cdna reads to support annotation and define exon-intron boundaries
the program to assemble spliced alignments  was developed to cluster expressed sequences on genomic dna using blat, sim <dig> and geneseqer and to generate spliced alignments to validate and update gene structures  <cit> . the gene structure updates provided by alignment assemblies are classified into several distinct categories: utr extension, gene model incorporation without modification, cds extension, gene model merging and gene isoform creation .

from the  <dig>  sequence reads, a total of  <dig>  were mapped to  <dig> m. truncatula genbank htgs phase  <dig> high quality sequence bacs , producing  <dig>  pasa assemblies. these assemblies were incorporated into  <dig>  existing imgag gene models. a total of  <dig>  assemblies extend  <dig>  utrs, and  <dig> assemblies alter the protein sequence of  <dig> genes. twenty gene models could be merged to produce  <dig> new genes, and  <dig> gene model isoforms could be created from pasa assemblies . a total of  <dig>  pasa assemblies had a /ag consensus donor/acceptor splice sites at intron boundaries and a near-complete, near-perfect alignment requiring at least 90% of the sequencealigned with at least 95% sequence identity. introns generated from  <dig> pasa assemblies of length greater than a generous  <dig> kb were excluded, effectively eliminating alignments with false terminal extensionswhich otherwise appear to be high quality alignments.

to determine whether the novel transcripts which lack a mtgi match were useful in medicago gene structure annotation, the  <dig>  sequences consisting of assemblies plus singletons that had no match in the existing mtgi were mapped to  <dig> m. truncatula phase  <dig> bacs using pasa. from the  <dig>  sequences that aligned,  <dig>  pasa assemblies were generated and incorporated into  <dig>  existing imgag gene models. an additional  <dig> assemblies extend the utrs of  <dig> genes and  <dig> assemblies altered the protein sequence of  <dig> gene prediction. five gene models were capable of merging with five other gene models and eight gene model isoforms could be created. a total of  <dig> of these pasa assemblies conformed to the /ag consensus donor/acceptor splice sites.

thus, as with longer ests, 454-generated sequences derived from both known and novel transcripts in a cdna library can be mapped onto genomic sequence and provide valid spliced alignments to provide support for and modifications of gene predictions providing gene structure updates and defining exon-intron boundaries.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, two major ideas were examined: whether the deep sequencing made cost-effective by the  <dig> technology leads to significant new gene discovery in a cdna library, and whether the short reads produced by the  <dig> technology are of value in gene structure annotation. approximately 30% of the reads produced by a single  <dig> run were not found in the medicago gene index derived from over  <dig>  ests from more than  <dig> libraries, illustrating the power of the deep sequencing facilitated by this technology to generate more gene hits, and reveal rare and novel transcripts, albeit only a small portion of each sequence. although the read lengths are short,  <dig> % of the reads were of sufficient length to map to unique locations on the medicago genome as with ests from the mtgi via conventional sequencing. functional annotation shows that the  <dig> sequences cover a broad range of go categories. in addition,  <dig> reads can be mapped onto genomic sequence to provide support for and modifications of gene predictions. we expect that a similar analysis using other plant species would work synergistically with existing est data and identify new genes/transcripts and/or support a significant number of existing gene models at a very cost effective and efficient manner.
