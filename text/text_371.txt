BACKGROUND
rhizobia are gram-negative soil bacteria which can engage in a mutualistic association with leguminous plants. under nitrogen-limiting conditions, rhizobia colonize plant roots and highly specialized plant organs, the nodules, are generated de novo on host roots . when living symbiotically, rhizobia are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by the plant. in return, they receive dicarboxylic acids as a carbon and energy source for their metabolism. nitrogen is the most frequent limiting macronutrient in many soils, and it is generally supplied as fertilizer. the rhizobium-legume mutualistic association can reduce or eliminate nitrogen fertilizer requirements, resulting also in a benefit to the environment  <cit> .

a successful symbiosis is the result of an elaborate developmental program, regulated by the exchange of molecular signals between the two partners  <cit> . during growth in the rhizosphere of the host plant, rhizobia sense compounds secreted by the host root and respond by inducing bacterial nodulation  genes which are required for the synthesis of rhizobial signal molecules of lipo-chitooligosaccharide nature, the nod factors. in the host plant, the generation of intracellular ca2+ oscillations triggered by nod factors has been firmly established as one of the earliest crucial events in symbiosis signalling; these oscillations are transduced into downstream physiological and developmental responses  <cit> . it is not known whether there is a parallel key role for ca2+ in rhizobia.

as in eukaryotic cells, ca2+ is postulated to play essential functions in the regulation of a number of cellular processes in bacteria, including the cell cycle, differentiation, chemotaxis and pathogenicity  <cit> . homeostatic machinery that is able to regulate intracellular free ca2+ concentration  tightly is a prerequisite for a ca2+-based signalling system, and is known to be present in bacteria  <cit> . ca2+ transport systems have been demonstrated in bacteria, with the identification of primary pumps and secondary exchangers, as well as putative ca2+-permeable channels  <cit> . other ca2+ regulatory components such as ca2+-binding proteins, including several ef-hand proteins, have been detected and have been putatively identified from genomic sequences  <cit> .

in order to establish precisely when and how ca2+ regulates processes in bacteria it is essential to measure i and its changes in live cells. this has proven difficult because of problems in loading fluorescent ca2+ indicator dyes, such as fura- <dig>  into bacterial cells. however, the recombinant expression of the ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin, which has been demonstrated to be a suitable method to monitor i changes accurately in eukaryotes  <cit> , has been successfully applied also to bacteria. challenge of e.coli  <cit>  and the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. pcc <dig>  <cit>  expressing aequorin with different stimuli resulted in the induction of transient variations of i with specific ca2+ signatures.

here we report the introduction of a plasmid encoding apoaequorin in mesorhizobium loti, the specific symbiont of the model legume lotus japonicus, and the use of this reporter to examine the ca2+ response of rhizobia to abiotic and biotic stimuli. the results obtained highlight the occurrence in m. loti of ca2+-based mechanisms for sensing and responding to cues originating in the rhizosphere.

RESULTS
construction of an inducible reporter system for ca2+ measurements in rhizobia
the apoaequorin gene was cloned in the broad host-range expression vector pdb <dig>  <cit>  under the control of the strong synthetic promoter psyn, regulated by the laciq repressor . the paeq <dig> plasmid was mobilized by conjugation into the type strain of m. loti .

validation of the experimental system
the functioning in m. loti of the paeq <dig> plasmid containing the apoaequorin gene was verified by evaluating the level of aequorin expression in an in vitro reconstitution assay. light emitted by total soluble protein contained in the lysates from wild-type and aequorin-expressing m. loti cells was monitored after reconstitution of the apoprotein with coelenterazine. the strong luminescence signal detected in protein extracts from m. loti cells containing the apoaequorin construct and induced with iptg confirmed the efficient level of aequorin expression .

we analysed whether the introduced paeq <dig> plasmid  encoding apoaequorin or the expressed protein could affect bacterial cell growth and the symbiotic performance of m. loti cells. there is no significant effect on bacterial growth kinetics exerted either by the introduced plasmid or apoaequorin expression. nodulation efficiency of m. loti paeq <dig> cells on the specific plant host lotus japonicus was checked  <dig> weeks after bacterial inoculation on roots of seedlings grown on nitrogen-free medium. l. japonicus roots were found to be effectively nodulated by the transformed bacterial strain, with no differences in nodule number  and morphological parameters in comparison to seedlings inoculated with wild-type m. loti. the presence of bacteria inside nodules was verified by light microscopy . green foliage was indicative of functional symbiosis.

the occurrence in m. loti cells of homeostatic control of the internal ca2+ activity was then verified by preliminary ca2+ measurement assays in a luminometer after in vivo reconstitution of apoaequorin. unperturbed exponentially growing rhizobial cells showed a steady-state intracellular free ca2+ concentration  residing in the submicromolar range  , demonstrating a tight regulation of i. no luminescence was detected either in cultures of the non-recombinant strain incubated with coelenterazine or in recombinant cells that had not been exposed to coelenterazine , confirming that the recorded signal was due only to ca2+-dependent light emission from aequorin.

environmental stimuli are sensed through transient i elevations by m. loti
to further validate the experimental system, abiotic stimuli which are known to trigger i changes in both plants  <cit>  and cyanobacteria  <cit>  were applied to apoaequorin-expressing m. loti cells. a mechanical perturbation, simulated by the injection of isoosmotic cell culture medium, resulted in a rapid ca2+ transient increase  that decayed within  <dig> sec . this ca2+ trace, which is frequently referred to as a "touch response", is often observed after the hand-operated injection of any stimulus  <cit> . a similar ca2+ response characterized by an enhanced ca2+ peak of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm was triggered by a simple injection of air into the cell suspension with a needle .

cold and hypoosmotic shocks, caused by supplying three volumes of ice-cold medium and distilled water, respectively, induced ca2+ traces with distinct kinetics, e.g. different height of the ca2+ peak  and rate of dissipation of the ca2+ signal . as a control, cells were stimulated with three volumes of growth medium at room temperature,  resulting in a ca2+ trace superimposable on that of the touch response . these findings eliminate the possible effect of bacterial dilution on changes in ca2+ homeostasis.

challenge of m. loti with a salinity stress, which has recently been shown to affect symbiosis-related events in rhizobium tropici  <cit> , resulted in a i elevation of large amplitude  and a specific signature .

variations in the extracellular ca2+ concentration determined the induction of transient ca2+ elevations whose magnitude was dependent on the level of external ca2+. after a rapidly induced increase in i, the basal ca2+ level was gradually restored with all the applied external ca2+ concentrations , confirming a tight internal homeostatic ca2+ control, as previously shown for other bacteria  <cit> .

all the above results indicate that aequorin-expressing m. loti cells comprise a functionally valid system with which to investigate the involvement of ca2+ in intracellular transduction of environmental stimuli.

host plant root exudates induce in m. loti a ca2+ signal required for activation of nodulation genes
root exudates from the symbiotically compatible legume l. japonicus were collected from 3-week-old seedlings axenically grown in water and applied to m. loti cells. the dose used for ca2+ measurements was in the range that induced significant expression of noda, nodb, nodc genes in m. loti . this concentration was found to trigger a transient i change characterized by a very rapid increase  followed by a second sustained major ca2+ peak  at about  <dig> min , with a slow decay within the considered time interval . the observed induction of transient i changes in m. loti cells suggests a ca2+-mediated perception of signalling molecules contained in host plant root exudates.

flavonoids are components of root exudates that play a prominent role as inducers of structural nod genes in rhizobia. although flavonoids have been detected in l. japonicus seeds  <cit> , those that specifically activate the expression of nod genes in m. loti have not yet been identified  <cit> . the most common flavonoids, known as nod gene inducers in other rhizobia  were not able to trigger transient ca2+ elevations in m. loti . tetronic acid, an aldonic acid previously reported to promote nod factor biosynthesis in m. loti  <cit> , was found to induce a detectable ca2+ response . the kinetics of the ca2+ trace was similar to that induced by crude root exudates, with a prompt ca2+ spike  and a subsequent flattened dome . notably, this second phase of the ca2+ transient induced by tetronic acid only partially accounted for the larger ca2+ increase recorded with the whole l. japonicus root exudates . likewise, the level of nod gene expression induced by tetronic acid was found to be lower  than that generated by total root exudates .

pretreatment of rhizobial cells with the extracellular ca2+ chelator egta for  <dig> min effectively inhibited both the transient ca2+ elevation  and nod gene activation  induced by l. japonicus root exudates. this indicates that the main source of the observed ca2+ response is the extracellular medium, and that the elevation in i is required for nod gene induction. cell viability, monitored by the baclight bacterial viability assay, was not altered by incubation with the ca2+ chelator . the expression of both constitutive  and inducible  genes was not significantly affected by egta treatment , ruling out possible general effects of extracellular ca2+ chelation on gene induction.

to check host specificity of the ca2+ signal, metabolite mixtures exuded by the non-host legumes soybean and vicia sativa subsp. nigra were tested. after an initial rapid and steep ca2+ rise , shared also by the response to l. japonicus root exudates, the ca2+ transients triggered by non-host exudates show very different kinetics, such as a slow rate of decay of the ca2+ level . pretreatment with egta also blocked these transient ca2+ elevations . the distinct ca2+ signature activated by non-host legumes, together with the lack of activation of nod genes , suggests the possibility of ca2+-mediated perception by m. loti of molecules other than nod gene inducers, such as non-specific chemoattractants or other signalling molecules, e.g. proteins  <cit>  or plant cell wall fragments released during the detachment of border cells from the root tip  <cit> , activating a different ca2+ signalling pathway. further confirmation of the specificity of the host plant-induced ca2+ signalling comes from the complete absence of any detectable ca2+ change and nod gene transcriptional activation by root exudates from a non-legume  .

discussion
even though ca2+-based signal transduction processes are well-established to underpin plant cell responses to rhizobial informational molecules, a possible involvement of ca2+ as a messenger in rhizobia in response to plant symbiotic signals has not hitherto been considered. we approached this issue by constructing a m. loti strainexpressing the bioluminescent ca2+ indicator aequorin. the highly sensitive and reliable aequorin-based method is widely used to monitor the dynamic changes of i in both eukaryotic  <cit>  and bacterial  <cit>  living cells and represents to date the tool of choice for monitoring ca2+ changes in cell populations  <cit> . the effectiveness of this recombinant technique has been verified at more than one level, and the results obtained demonstrate the utility of aequorin as a probe to study the early recognition events in rhizobium-legume interactions from the bacterial perspective.

the generation of a well-defined and reproducible ca2+ transient in m. loti cells in response to root exudates of the host plant l. japonicus containing nod gene inducers is indicative of ca2+ participation in sensing and transducing diffusible host-specific signals. it cannot be ruled out that the biphasic pattern of the ca2+ trace , monitored by the aequorin method, may be due to an instantaneous synchronized ca2+ increase in cells immediately after stimulation, followed by a sustained ca2+ response probably due to the sum of asynchronous oscillations occurring in single cells. ca2+ oscillations, considered as a universal mode of signalling in eukaryotic cells  <cit>  have been proposed to occur in bacteria as well  <cit> .

the significant inhibition of nod gene expression obtained when the ca2+ elevation is blocked indicates that an upstream ca2+ signal is required for nod gene activation. the ca2+ dependence of nod gene expression strongly suggests that the i change, evoked by l. japonicus exudates, represents an essential prerequisite to convey the plant symbiotic message into rhizobia. all the above results fulfil the criteria required to demonstrate that a ca2+ transient is a crucial intermediate in a stimulus-response coupling  <cit>  and confirm that ca2+ signalling is operating in bacteria  <cit> .

the inability of root exudates from non-host legumes and non legumes to duplicate the response induced by l. japonicus exudates  further supports the symbiotic specificity of the host legume-induced ca2+ signature. the possible relatedness to legume-rhizobium symbiosis of the signals contained in non-host legume exudates is supported by the absence of any ca2+ response to non-legume exudates. in non-host legume root exudates m. loti cells may sense signalling molecules related to the symbiotic process but not strictly specific to the compatible host-microsymbiont pair, which may enable rhizobia to distinguish non-host from compatible plants.

plant root exudates contain a pool of molecules, both stimulatory and inhibitory, of potential relevance to the molecular signal exchange between the two partners  <cit> . the use of entire natural mixtures secreted by plant roots represents the first step in the evaluation of rhizobium reactions to plant factors, providing information on the global ca2+ responses occurring in the bacterial partner early in the symbiosis, even before a physical contact between the two interacting organisms. further insights into the dynamics of the activated ca2+ change may come from the comparison with the ca2+ responses obtained by using fractionated root exudates or purified molecules. this would enable to assess the possible placement of the ca2+ signal within the nodd-flavonoid gene expression paradigm  <cit>  in different species of rhizobia.

CONCLUSIONS
the above results demonstrate that m. loti cells sense host plant symbiotic cues through ca2+ and indicate that activation of nod genes requires an upstream ca2+ signal. transgenic rhizobium strains expressing aequorin can be used as a novel approach to the dissection of early events in legume-rhizobium symbiosis, that may shed light on a previously uninvestigated facet - bacterial ca2+ signalling - of the two-way partner signal exchange and transduction.
