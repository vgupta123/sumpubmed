BACKGROUND
lyme disease, caused by the spirochete bacteria borrelia burgdorferi, has become the most common vector-borne disease in the united states and europe  <cit> . the genome organization of the bacterium and the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with lyme disease have presented a number of research challenges. lyme disease is frequently a multisystem infection, commonly affecting the skin, joints, and central nervous system in humans  <cit> , yet at other times the symptoms are restricted to the skin. although much of the attention on b. burgdorferi involves the disease in humans, there is a complex relationship between the microbe in its vector, the ixodes tick, the animals it can infect, and the environment. for example, the prevalence of b. burgdorferi is associated with the geographic range and abundance of its host species rather than its tick  vector  <cit> . although it has been found in many vertebrates in the united states, white-footed mice  and eastern chipmunks  serve as major maintenance reservoirs of b. burgdorferi; however, there may be other preferred host species for different local strains  <cit> . in europe, b. burgdorferi  is transmitted by ixodes ricinus ticks  <cit>  and is carried by a large variety of hosts including birds and small-to-medium sized mammals  <cit> . for many reasons lyme disease remains a puzzling emerging disease  <cit> .

globally, the b. burgdorferi species complex  <cit> , b. burgdorferi sensu lato , is classified into different genomic groups or species  on the basis of their molecular phylogeny. these species differ by 1%-2% in the 16s ribosomal rna sequences  <cit>  and by about 9% in average genome sequences where the latter is known  <cit>  . the most common species in north america are b. burgdorferi sensu stricto  in the northeast and north central parts of the united states and b. bissettii in california and the western united states  <cit> . the most common species in europe are b. garinii <cit> , b. afzelii <cit> , b. burgdorferi s.s., b. valaisiana and b spielmanii <cit> . b. garinii, b. afzelii, and b. valaisiana are also common in northern asia, but b. burgdorferi s.s. is absent from eastern asia  <cit> . the three species b. burgdorferi s.s., b. garinii, and b. afzelii are the most common pathogens of lyme disease, and they are each associated with different clinical manifestations of chronic lyme disease  <cit> . more recently b. bissettii, b. lusitaniae, b. spielmanii and b. valaisiana have been isolated from human patients  <cit> . a series of molecular genotyping assays using genome-wide sequence signatures and individual loci have found genetic differentiation between the two continental b. burgdorferi s.s. populations, a european origin of the north american populations, and a few shared genotypes between the european and north american populations perhaps caused by contemporary migrations  <cit> . intriguingly, we find that genotypes characterized as highly pathogenic in humans are also the ones that have a broad host-species range, able to colonize both continents  <cit> .

intra-specific lineages of b. burgdorferi s.s. can be differentiated by 16s-23s ribosomal rna spacer  and outer surface protein c gene  sequences  <cit> . it has been found that these different intra-specific lineages may be related to different levels of pathogenicity. for example, a particular restriction fragment length polymorphism  in the b. burgdorferi igs sequence and ospc type are associated with hematogenous dissemination in patients with early stage lyme disease  <cit> . a significant number of ospc clonal types associated with invasive disease in humans have also been found in b. afzelii and b. garinii <cit> ; however, the ospc clonal types isolated from patients with invasive disease are not limited to those types  <cit> . these subtypes have been further subdivided using a broad range primer assay coupled with mass spectrometry  <cit> . however, none of these studies examined entire genomes in its entirety, so conclusions remain limited.

the overall objective of the study reported here was to develop an informative genome-wide picture of b. burgdorferi diversity, with the ultimate aim of understanding how variations in genomic composition may lead to variations in pathogenicity. although this study did not examine the molecular basis of lyme disease per se, we believe it will greatly enhance such studies in many ways. for example, conserved genome features should in principle be those likely to be most essential in the borrelia life cycle, while variable ones might be those that are more important immunologically and ecotypically. the present study was undertaken to help the scientific community generate hypotheses about what genes are related to human disease or of ecologic importance in the life cycle of this pathogen. furthermore, such studies should provide some insight as to whether there is potential for the non-lyme disease causing species to serve as a reservoir of genetic diversity for those that cause lyme disease.

RESULTS
harvesting the genomic diversity of the lyme agent through selection of borrelia strains for whole-genome shotgun sequencing
research efforts aimed at deciphering the mechanisms of borrelia pathogenicity have resulted in significant progress over the past few years  <cit> . however, the costs and difficulties for propagation of the bacteria in culture, the prolonged doubling time of borrelia, in addition to the limited tools that are available for genetic manipulation, have presented a number of significant challenges. therefore, rigorous genetic studies and biochemical approaches that require even moderate amounts of biological materials are expensive, technically difficult and slow. because of recent dramatic reductions in the dna sequencing costs, comparative genomics studies of borrelia species are now a cost effective way to provide a firm foundation for the generation of new, informed, and testable hypotheses which would be difficult or impossible to formulate by other means.

the borrelia genus contains two major clades, one that includes the lyme disease agents, and another that includes the relapsing fever agents, each of which contains numerous species  <cit> . variation among b. burgdorferi isolates has most recently been analyzed informatively using mlst analyses  <cit> . in order to choose a panel of isolates for genome sequencing that maximized the represented b. burgdorferi s.s. genetic diversity, we mlst-typed  <dig> such isolates  that reside in different major groups based on rrna igs <dig> spacer sequence  <cit>  and ospc sequence  <cit>  while also attempting to include a variety of hosts and geographical regions. in addition, we included geographically diverse b. burgdorferi s.l. isolates, including several species that are not known to commonly cause lyme disease. twenty-two isolates were chosen for sequencing that included most of the major branches of this mlst tree .

bfor b. burgdorferi strain  <dig>  all the plasmids have been identified and sequenced to closure. however, the chromosome of  <dig> was not sequenced.

cthe complete sequences for all strain pbi plasmids have not yet been reported.

these isolates include  <dig> b. burgdorferi s.s. strains  which include six isolates from ticks , a wild bird isolate , and seven isolates from human lyme disease patients  <cit> . within these s.s. isolates, considerable geographic distribution is also present, and it includes isolates from california, wisconsin, new york, massachusetts and connecticut as well as germany and italy. in addition, eight other b. burgdorferi s.l. strains were chosen for sequencing, including two b. afzelii , two b. garinii   <cit> , single b. bissettii , b. spielmanii  and b. valaisiana  isolates  <cit> , and one isolate that may be an uncharacterized species   <cit> . the latter seven isolates include human, bird  and tick  isolates. table  <dig> lists the isolates whose genomes we analyze in this report along with their rrna igs and ospc types. in addition, the chromosome and some plasmid sequences have been reported for b. “bavariensis” strain pbi  <cit> , so altogether the sequences of  <dig> chromosomes and  <dig> plasmid sequences have been reported from  <dig> b. burgdorferi s.l. genomes.

borrelia chromosomal diversity
chromosomal sequences from the above thirteen strains of b. burgdorferi s.s. and nine other borrelia s.l. isolates were aligned using the mugsy genome aligner to compute a conserved chromosomal core sequence alignment which consisted of  <dig>  bp of nucleotide sequence present in all chromosome sequences . the difference between this value and the ~ <dig>  bp of the chromosomal constant regions  is nearly all due to gaps between contigs in the draft chromosome sequences. in agreement with various less comprehensive methods  <cit> , we find that the chromosomes of different isolates and species of b. burgdorferi s.l. are syntenic and conserved across nearly the entire length of the chromosome.

length differences of up to about  <dig> kbp among b. burgdorferi chromosomes are due to different lengths of plasmid-like dna sequences attached to their right ends . the constant chromosomal region spans approximately  <dig> kbp located at the left end of the chromosome, and is delimited by type-strain b <dig> genes b31_ <dig> through b31_ <dig> . in order to have consistent annotations across all the chromosomes sequenced, the b <dig> genome annotation was refreshed during this study and now predicts  <dig> genes in this region, which occupy  <dig> % of the chromosome constant region . we examined three of the b. burgdorferi chromosomes for open reading frame differences and disruptions, and found  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> disruptions in strains b <dig>  n <dig> and jd <dig>  respectively . some of the apparent disruptions in b <dig> are likely due to sequencing errors, since base calling and genome assembly were less accurate in  <dig> when strain b <dig> was originally sequenced, there are very few obviously disrupted genes in the constant regions of these chromosomes.

the constant regions of the b. burgdorferi s.s. linear chromosomes are remarkably similar. nucleotide differences between the thirteen chromosomes range from only  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  . furthermore, only four indels larger than  <dig> bp are present. a 157-bp deletion appears to inactivate chromosomal gene  <dig>  which is predicted to encode the trna modification enzyme that synthesizes queuosine in a number of the b. burgdorferi sequences, and variable numbers of tandem repeat sequences are present in three genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  . gene b31_ <dig> encodes the surface protein lmp <dig> that may be required for host serum resistance  <cit> , and b31_ <dig> and b31_ <dig> encode a protein of unknown function and translation initiation factor  <dig>  respectively . in the b. burgdorferi s.s. chromosomes, the numbers of these repeats vary from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively, in these three genes , so these variable number tandem repeat  loci should be useful for lineage or epidemic tracking in borrelia.

a table values are percent differences in nucleotide sequence as determined from pairwise comparisons of the mugsy alignment described in the methods section.

the chromosomes of b. burgdorferi isolate b <dig>  one b. “bavariensis” isolate , and one b. afzelii  isolate species have previously been reported to have nearly identical gene content  <cit> . we confirm these observations and extend them to additional species. our data show that the sequences of b. burgdorferi, b. afzelii, b. garinii and b. valaisiana chromosomes are from  <dig> % to  <dig> % different from one another in between-species comparisons . the chromosomes of b. bissettii, b. spielmanii and b. “bavariensis”  are  <dig> % different from b. burgdorferi,  <dig> % different from b. afzelii and  <dig> % different from b. garinii, respectively. the chromosome of the finland isolate sv <dig> is  <dig>  ±  <dig> % different from the b. burgdorferi s.s. isolates , and its plasmids are quite different from those of b. burgdorferi . thus, if as has been suggested by margos and colleagues  <cit>  isolate pbi represents a newly defined species b. “bavariensis”, then isolate sv <dig> might also be considered as representative of another previously undefined species, for which we have suggested the name b. “finlandensis”  <cit> . the observed differences between isolates within species,  <dig> ± <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for b. burgdorferi s.s., b. afzelii and b. garinii, respectively, are all considerably less than inter-species values and so robustly confirm these existing groupings .

we have not performed an exhaustive comparison of the indels that relate the constant region of the b. burgdorferi s.s. chromosome to those of the other b. burgdorferi s.l. species, but nearly all of the b. burgdorferi chromosomal genes are present in chromosomes of each of the s.l. species. for example, our comparison of b. burgdorferi and b. afzelii shows that in addition to inter-species differences in the three repeat-containing genes mentioned above, we find only eleven indels larger than  <dig> bp that differentiate the chromosomes of the two species . compared to strain b <dig>  these include the previously described duplications in the bmp gene region in strains pbi and pko  <cit> , the differential presence of two genes , five indels < <dig> bp long between genes, and indels of < <dig> bp in genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, both b. afzelii isolates pko and aca- <dig> have an apparent duplication of the 16s rrna gene region relative to other b. burgdorferi s.l. isolates. we note that the above non-vntr indels are the same in the chromosomes of both sequenced b. afzelii genomes , again indicating the very similar nature of chromosomes within each species. finally, an unusually variable region of the chromosome was identified in regions orthologous to b <dig> gene b31_ <dig> , which has suffered various deletions/insertions in the different species. it is possible that these chromosomal indel differences could be used for species identification.

the linear chromosomes of four members of the relapsing fever borrelia clade have also been sequenced, those of b. recurrentis, b. duttonii, b. hermsii and b. turicatae . in regions of homology, their chromosomes are typically about 20% different in sequence from the lyme agent species, and form three subgroups: recurrentis/duttonii, hermsii and turicatae within which hermsii and turicatae chromosomes are 5-10% different and they in turn are 10-15% different from recurrentis and duttonii . the relapsing fever clade chromosomes are generally syntenic with the lyme agent chromosomes, but b. recurrentis and b. duttonii have about thirty gene content differences in the chromosomal “constant region”  <cit>  . it is clear that all known borrelias have quite similar chromosomes.

borrelia plasmid diversity
among the  <dig> b. burgdorferi s.s. isolates analyzed, the number of plasmids carried by each strain varies between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the other b. burgdorferi s.l. species carry on average somewhat fewer plasmids, between  <dig> in b. garinii far <dig> and  <dig> plasmids in b. afzelii pko . we have previously argued that plasmid proteins encoded by paralogous family   <dig> correlate with the compatibility type of borrelia plasmids that are > <dig> kbp in length  <cit> . our preliminary unpublished analysis suggests that the sequenced lyme agent plasmids represent  <dig> pfam <dig> protein compatibility types, and probably several additional types that do not have pfam <dig> genes. since b <dig> carries  <dig> different pfam <dig> type plasmids, and only ten “new” types are present in the  <dig> subsequently sequenced genomes, it seems likely that if other plasmid compatibility types remain to be discovered, they are not common. analysis of all  <dig> lyme agent genomes shows that plasmids cp <dig>  lp <dig> and at least a few cp32s are always present and largely structurally conserved . some plasmids, lp <dig> and lp <dig>  are less common and present in fewer than 10% of the analyzed isolates, while other plasmids are nearly always present but are organizationally variable . we recently described an in-depth analysis of the plasmids present in four b. burgdorferi s.s. isolates  <cit> , and a similar analysis of the additional plasmids sequenced in this study will be presented in a subsequent publication. only the most highly conserved plasmids, cp <dig> and lp <dig>  will be discussed further here.

single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis
to further resolve the population structure of borrelia species and gain insights into the evolutionary history, gene sequence conservation and diversity across borrelia isolates, we applied a single nucleotide polymorphism -based genotyping methodology on the predicted gene sequences that are conserved across all sequenced borrelia linear chromosomes and the lp <dig> and cp <dig> plasmids, using the b. burgdorferi b <dig> genome as reference. only intragenic snps were considered, because the goal was to gain insights into protein sequence variations across the different isolates . the small number of snps that might be present in the gaps between contigs in the chromosomes that remain in “draft” state would not be included in our analysis, but this does not affect any of the conclusions drawn below.

we identified a total of  <dig>  synonymous snps  and  <dig>  non-synonymous snps  in cp <dig>   <dig>  ssnps and  <dig>  nssnps in lp <dig>  and  <dig>  ssnps and  <dig>  nssnps in the chromosomes of the  <dig> isolates  <cit> . the snp locations were concatenated into one sequence and a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was built with this information . the branching orders of the different species are identical in the chromosome and cp <dig> snp trees, indicating that these two replicons as a whole have not been reassorted during the evolution of the strains in this study. all three snp trees are consistent with the previously delineated b. burgdorferi s.l. species, since the different species reside on strongly-supported, well-separated branches. all three trees show that b. “finlandensis”  is a rather close relative of b. burgdorferi . nonetheless sv <dig> is consistently and robustly separated from the b. burgdorferi s.s. strain cluster as well as from the other species, confirming the uniqueness of the sv <dig> isolate and its status as a potential new species  <cit> . the trees also show that b. bissettii strain dn <dig> is most closely related to b. burgdorferi s.s., b. “bavariensis” pbi is most closely related to b. garinii, and b. spielmanii a14s is most closely related to b. afzelii. b. valaisiana vs <dig> not particularly closely related to any of the other species in this study. the lp <dig> snp tree is quite similar to the chromosome and cp <dig> trees , except that the b. garinii-b. “bavariensis” cluster occupies a somewhat different position in the tree that is less closely associated with the b. afzelii-b. spielmanii branch than in the other two trees, and the b. bissettii lp <dig> plasmid is more divergent than its chromosome or cp <dig>  the positions of the b <dig> and wi91- <dig> lp54s are also somewhat different within the b. burgdorferi s.s. cluster than in the other two trees. lp <dig>  while not appearing to have diverged more rapidly than the chromosome or cp <dig>  may have undergone horizontal exchange at more locations than the other two replicons  <cit> .

this snp-based phylogeny reveals a tight grouping of all the b. burgdorferi s.s. strains, a finding consistent with their overall sequence similarity  and previous analyses using rrna igs sequences  <cit>  or protein-coding gene sequences in mlst analyses . in addition, the chromosome and cp <dig> snp trees  give very similar well-resolved pictures of the phylogenetic organization of the b. burgdorferi s.s. clade. the three snp-based trees have highly supported branch points and consistently identify four subgroups: strains b31/64b/bol26/zs <dig>  strains n40/29805/wi91- <dig>  strains 118a/72a/ca <dig> a-94a, and strains 156a/297/jd <dig>  these four subgroups are named snp groups a, b, c and d, respectively, in figure  <dig>  intra-species chromosomal diversity is about the same in the three cases where multiple genome sequences are available from a single species; i.e., the  <dig> chromosomes of b. burgdorferi isolates are about as divergent from one another as the two b. garinii and the two b. afzelii isolates are from each other .

are these four snp-based b. burgdorferi s.s. chromosome and cp <dig> snp subgroups consistent with other chromosomal typing methods? the previous chromosomal typing strategies to which we can compare our genome sequence data are rrna igs <dig> sequence type  <cit> , rrna igs <dig> restriction site type   <cit>  and two mlst schemes: the mlst analysis of margos et al.  <cit>   and our mlst analysis . both mlst studies included information from a number of chromosomal genes and so incorporate more information than the igs <dig> categorizations; they utilized different sets of eight and six chromosomal genes, respectively. table  <dig> shows a compilation of the chromosomal “types” determined by these different methods, and it shows that snp group a is convincingly supported by all four of the above analyses. these four strains clearly represent a separate chromosomal clade from the rest of the b. burgdorferi s.s. isolates. igs <dig> and mlst analyses indicate that igs <dig> types  <dig> and  <dig> form one major chromosomal clade and all the other types form a second major division . dissection of the second major igs1/mlst division into convincing sub-clades has been less certain. the inclusion of strains 156a and  <dig> in snp group d is in agreement with rrna and mlst analyses that also show these two strains to be closely related, however only the snp analysis includes jd <dig> in this cluster. snp groups b and c together correspond largely to rst type  <dig>  and some of these strains are similarly clustered by the other methods . however, there are also significant differences among the different grouping methods. for example, both mlst analyses place 118a and wi91- <dig> in the same group, while they robustly reside in snp groups c and b, respectively; and jd <dig> is placed in a different group in each of these three analyses. thus, although all three snp, igs <dig> and mlst typing methods display the genetic diversity of b. burgdorferi species, significant differences exist among these analyses, even when the two mlst analyses are compared. these differences are most likely due to the relatively small number of polymorphic sites at igs <dig> and mlst loci, which subject the latter trees more strongly to the homoplastic effects of recombination.

in table  <dig> we also show a summary of the following three additional categorizations which are not subject to homoplasy issues:  linear plasmid contents indicate that these are most similar within the following three groups: b31/64b/bol26/zs <dig>  156a/297/jd <dig>  and 118a/72a/ca <dig> a/94a  which correspond perfectly to snp groups a, d and c, respectively;  the plasmid accretion events at the chromosome’s right end are fully consistent with the four snp groups ; and  the  <dig> bp deletion in chromosomal gene b31_ <dig> that is present in some b. burgdorferi s.s. strains  is limited to snp groups b and d . the fact that b type strain  <dig> does not have the deletion, along with the facts that the linear plasmids of the three type b isolates are not particularly similar to each other or the other isolates and that the d strains are not clustered by igs <dig> or mlst methods , suggest that snp group b strains may be less uniform than the other three snp groups. the overall agreement between snp analysis and the plasmid content, chromosome right end structure and deletions in homologues of gene  <dig>  along with the extremely large number of alleles in the snp analysis, lead us to conclude that the snp groups most accurately reflect the real average evolutionary history of the chromosome. of course, occasional horizontal exchange of approximately gene sized dna fragments is known to happen and can lead to differences in the evolutionary histories of any given locus  <cit> .

the borrelia pan-genome
the genetic repertoire of a given species can be much larger than the gene content of individual strains, as the gene content of individual strains of the same species can vary considerably, and new genes continue to be discovered even after sequencing the genomes of many isolates. this observation has led tettelin and colleagues to introduce the concept of “pan-genome”, defined as the sum of the core genome  and the dispensable genome   <cit> . the core genome typically comprises the genes that encode essential functions related to the basic biology of the species, whereas the dispensable genome contributes to species’ diversity and provides functions that are not essential to its basic lifestyle but that may confer selective advantages . in order to understand the basic biology and population genetics of any species, the core and dispensable genomes must be known.

one approach to estimate the extent of the core and dispensable genome components is to compute the number of new genes identified each time a new genome of a species is sequenced. each of the core and dispensable genomes should approach their true values as more genomes are analyzed, assuming the isolates chosen for sequencing span the genomic diversity of the species. this strategy was applied here for b. burgdorferi s.s. isolates , as well as b. burgdorferi s.l. isolates . pan-genome calculations have not been previously applied to borrelia due to the lack of high-quality complete genome sequence information.

the b. burgdorferi sensu stricto pan-genome
comparative genome analysis performed with  <dig> b. burgdorferi s.s. genomes  provides a picture of the genetic diversity within this species. extrapolation of the exponential decay model shown in figure 3a suggests that the size of the conserved gene core for the b. burgdorferi species reaches an asymptote with the comparison of ~ <dig> b. burgdorferi genomes, for a number of core genes of ~ <dig> genes . the model is based on the median number of conserved genes in each of the permutations of all possible genome comparisons. the functions encoded by the conserved core genome closely follow the distribution profile of the functional categories encoded in the entire borrelia genome; e.g. there is no enrichment for a particular functional category in the set of conserved core genes. a total of  <dig> % of the conserved core genes are hypothetical proteins , highlighting the potentially important roles of these unknown genes in the borrelia physiology.

closer examination of the conserved core genes plot reveals  <dig> clusters of data points . the first group of points, the yellow circles below the line y= <dig> , represent the genome comparisons in which the n <dig> strain is used as the reference. the size of the n <dig> core genome, compared to the other b. burgdorferi isolates, is approximately  <dig> genes. the data points highlighted by the green area in figure 3a, represent the genome comparisons where  <dig> strains are used as reference in permutations of genome comparisons: b <dig>  118a, 156a,  <dig>  64b, jd <dig> and wi91- <dig>  this group of strains is characterized by a larger core genome . finally, the third group of points is represented by the following  <dig> isolates: zs <dig>  bol <dig>  72a, ca- <dig> a and 94a .

a likely explanation for the observation that permutations in which n <dig> is used as the reference genome lead to low values of predicted conserved gene core  is that the n <dig> genome has a lower gene redundancy when compared to the other b. burgdorferi genomes. in order to test this hypothesis, we performed a jaccard orthologous clustering  analysis on  <dig> borrelia s.l. genomes. joc analysis is typically used to group together highly similar proteins within a single genome/organism of interest and allows for 1-to-many orthology. joc analysis has been applied to the analysis of various organisms such as streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> , neisseria meningitidis <cit>  and plasmodium <cit> . the jaccard clustering analysis predicted a total of  <dig>  orthologous protein clusters, each containing between  <dig> to  <dig> proteins  . the protein cluster with the largest number of members,  <dig> proteins across all the genomes, has no known function and is encoded on the cp <dig> plasmids . on average, for the  <dig> orthologous protein clusters with the most members , n <dig> had clusters with  <dig> % fewer members than the equivalent clusters in strain b <dig> . this result confirms that the n <dig> genome has the lowest gene redundancy, in part contributing to the n <dig> smaller gene core.

our pan-genome analysis also estimated the size of the dispensable genome of b. burgdorferi s.s., i.e. the genes absent from one or more strains and the genes that are unique to each strain . the large deviation from the mean shown in figure 3b, ranging from only a few to over one hundred genes, is a reflection of the genetic variation within b. burgdorferi. the regression model in figure 3b shows a rapid decrease in the predicted number of new genes discovered for each new b. burgdorferi genome sequenced. this number reaches  <dig> for a number of genomes close to  <dig> , confirming that the  <dig> b. burgdorferi genomes included in our study should nearly cover the complete genetic diversity of the species and that the sequencing of additional strains  would add only marginally to the known genetic pool.

the pan-genome plot in figure 3c represents an estimation of the complete borrelia s.s. gene pool based on the set of genomes analyzed. the extrapolated curve ceases to increase as new genomes are added to the analysis and reaches a plateau of approximately  <dig> genes: thus, the b. burgdorferi s.s. pan-genome is a “closed” pan-genome.

the pan-genome of b. burgdorferi sensu lato species
because of their conserved synteny and highly related sequences, we also applied the pan-genome analysis to the b. burgdorferi s.l. group of species, including b. valaisiana, b. afzelii, b. garinii, b. bissettii and b. spielmanii. calculation of the conserved core genome size predicted approximately  <dig> core genes across  <dig> b. burgdorferi s.l. genomes . the exponential decay shown in figure 4a is based on the median number of genes for each genome comparison, and reaches an asymptote with the comparison of about  <dig> genomes. the range of size of the core genomes is broad, and varies depending on the combination of genomes being compared, from  <dig>  genes for strain far <dig>  to  <dig>  genes for strain jd <dig>  the strains with the largest core genomes are jd <dig> , 64b , and 118a . the strains with the smallest core genomes are far <dig> , pbr , a14s  and n <dig> . examination of the protein clusters from the joc analysis  showed that only  <dig>  orthologous protein clusters were identified in the genome of strain far <dig> , compared to a total of  <dig>  for strain b <dig>  the lower number of protein clusters predicted for stain far <dig>  reflecting the absence of proteins otherwise present in the other borrelia s.l. genomes, is the main contributing factor explaining the far <dig> smaller conserved core.

with  <dig> genomes compared, the predicted median number of new genes discovered per genome sequenced is  <dig> genes . this suggests that there is still some genomic diversity left undiscovered within the borrelia s.l. species although it may not be great. however, this predicted number of new genes is not homogenous and varies quite significantly depending on the genome considered, as highlighted by the wide variability in the data points in figure 4b. the pan-genome analysis identified  <dig> unique genes in vs <dig>   <dig> for strain dn <dig>   <dig> for strains a14s and  <dig> for strain pbr. in comparison, no unique genes were predicted for strains 64b, 118a, b <dig>  156a, bol <dig>  zs <dig>  72a, ca- <dig> a and n <dig> when compared to the other  <dig> genomes, confirming the results from the pan-genome analysis of the b. burgdorferi s.s. strains.

the pan-genome analyses we describe here might help predicting the genomic basis of human pathogenicity in b. burgdorferi s.l. for example, we identified genes uniquely present or absent in the genomes of b. burgdorferi s.s., b. afzelii, and b. garinii, the three species causing the majority of known cases of lyme borreliosis. three uncharacterized b <dig> plasmid genes  are present in all b. burgdorferi s.s. genomes while being absent in all other species including its closest outgroup sv <dig>  the two b. afzelii genomes  have no uniquely present genes and one uniquely absent gene . the two b. garinii genomes  contain  <dig> uniquely present genes, one of which is predicted to be an adenine-specific dna methyltransferase . intriguingly, a large number of erp  genes are missing in b. garinii genomes. the relatively large number of uniquely gained and lost genes may be a result of adaptation of b. garinii to its avian reservoir hosts  <cit> . lineage-specific genes in these three highly pathogenic species, most of which are encoded in the plasmids, are listed in additional file 6: table s <dig>  each of the three species was represented by at least two genomes, further strengthening the predictions of presence or absence of specific genes in the different borrelia lineages. while these genes are strong candidates contributing to human virulence, there are also possibilities of neutral gene acquisition or loss.

the b. burgdorferi s.l. pan-genome size calculation  suggests that the pan-genome of this group is open, e.g. the extrapolated curve continues to increase as new genomes get added to the analysis.

phylogeny-based pan-genome analysis
traditional pan-genome analysis, as applied above, uses the number of genomes as the sole explanatory variable. in some cases, this approach insufficiently captures variations in the pan-genome because of the underlining phylogenetic structure among the genomes. phylogenetic autocorrelation among individual strains is common even in bacterial species with moderate amount of recombination such as e. coli and b. burgdorferi <cit> . except in an idealized population where individual genomes are equally related to each other , sampling an increasing number of genomes lead to an early plateau of the pan-genome size since random sampling quickly exhausts the total amount of phylogenetic diversity .

pan-genome predictions could be improved by taking into account the phylogenetic relatedness of the genomes. a coalescence-based approach to pan-genome prediction has previously been applied to streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> , and it has been shown that the linear dependence of pan-genome size on level of polymorphisms can be readily interpreted by the coalescence process  <cit> . in the present analysis, we used the length of the sub-tree connecting the genomes as a proxy for the total coalescence time among a set of genomes, an approach validated by the strong linearity of the relationships . a molecular phylogenetic tree theoretically reflects gene coalescence history closely when there is no recombination between strains. here, the level of recombination appears not high enough to distort genome phylogenies due to the fact that these trees are based on a large number of snps .

the coalescence model, and its extension to evolution between populations, requires a single explanatory parameter, the rate of gene acquisition ω. this model removes the phylogenetic autocorrelation in nonlinear models, and assumes that the bacterial pan-genome is mainly dependent on the total tree distance between the genomes compared. thus, any new genome added to the analysis can theoretically increase the pan-genome size proportionally to its contribution to the total genome tree. in the coalescence model, there is therefore no concept of an ”open” or ”closed” pan-genome, as defined using previous strategies  <cit> , but instead, the upper limit of a species pan-genome is solely determined by its overall phylogenetic diversity. considering that the selection of bacterial isolates for genome sequencing is generally not random, the coalescence model might prove more robust in predicting bacterial pan-genomes. the coalescence model validates our genome sequencing strategy to sequence major evolutionary lineages within and between b. burgdorferi s.l. species, which maximizes pan-genome coverage for a given number of genomes.

based on the coalescence model, expanding the set of genomes by sequencing additional b. burgdorferi s.s. lineages or b. burgdorferi s.l. species would extend the curves but not change the linear models themselves. according to the linear dependency of pan-genome sizes on the chromosomal snp tree , we estimate that the rates of gene acquisition within and between species are, respectively,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  genes per unit tree distance, which is one substitution per nucleotide site on the main chromosome . the gene acquisition rate is thus 30% higher for between-species divergence than for within-species divergence. since b. burgdorferi s.l. species may differ in vertebrate host preference but not necessarily in their tick vectors, one contributing factor to the accelerated gene acquisition between species could be host adaptation.

considering the genetic distances  for a pair of b. burgdorferi s.s. strains – about  <dig> % per nucleotide site and a pair of b. burgdorferi s.l. species -  <dig> %, the above gene-acquisition rates translate to a gain of roughly  <dig>   novel gene during strain divergence within species and  <dig>  genes between species. based on the length of the aligned common sequences of the main chromosomes , these gene-acquisition rates translate to  <dig> x10- <dig>  snps within b. burgdorferi s.s. and  <dig> x10- <dig>  genes per snp between b. burgdorferi s.l. both rates are two orders of magnitude lower than the reported gene acquisition rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  genes per snp in streptococcus pneumonia <cit> . these low gene-acquisition rates suggest that our previous conclusion of the gene-content stability of b. burgdorferi s.s. holds true for the entire b. burgdorferi s.l. species group  <cit> . indeed, b. burgdorferi s.l. appears to have one of the largest core genomes among bacterial pathogens, which amounts to  <dig> %  of the pan-genome within b. burgdorferi s.s.  and  <dig> %  of the pan-genome b. burgdorferi s.l. . in comparison, the proportion of the core genome relative to the pan-genome ranges from  <dig> % in clostridium botulinum to  <dig> % in yersinia pestis by one survey  <cit>  and from 44% in escherichia coli to 98% in mycobacterium tuberculosis by a more recent account  <cit> . genome stability in b. burgdorferi s.l. and others may be a reflection of low rates of horizontal gene transfer and, ultimately, narrow ecological niches of these bacterial species  <cit> . based on the high degree of genome stability of b. burgdorferi s.l. and the large variations in the size of paralogous gene families among strains , we conclude that adaptive genome evolution in b. burgdorferi s.l. is driven primarily by duplication and loss of genes  and not by acquisition of new genes through horizontal gene transfer. nevertheless, variations in gene regulatory sequences may contribute to the adaptive genome divergence in b. burgdorferi s.l. as well.

the phylogeny-based pan-genome models allow for a more accurate prediction of the pan-genome size, providing a robust guidance for future genome sequencing efforts in b. burgdorferi s.l. in figure  <dig>  the predicted pan-genome sizes, calculated from genome permutations in which b <dig> was used as the reference, are plotted against the total number of phylogenetic groups. the goal of this approach was to determine how the predicted b. burgdorferi s.l. pan-genome size might be affected by sequencing additional phylogenetic groups. the addition of each species genome to b. burgdorferi s.l. increases the pan-genome size by approximately 50– <dig> distinct genes . since the overall relationship is linear , we predict based on this model that future sequencing of new b. burgdorferi s.l. species is likely to add similar numbers of new genes. by the same reasoning, this analysis predicts that sequencing an additional ospc-typed genomic group  would add little  to the pan-genome of b. burgdorferi s.s. .

orf sequence variation in borrelia spp
to quantify evolutionary constraints on the amino acid variations at each orf locus, we calculated maximum likelihood estimates of synonymous  and nonsynonymous  nucleotide substitution rates between b <dig> and the other s.s. and s.l. strains by using the paml package  <cit>  . among the three replicons, orfs on cp <dig> have the highest average k
s
 values . the elevated k
s
 values on cp <dig> are almost certainly a result of selectively maintained high localized recombination rates in regions surrounding ospc <cit> . orfs on lp <dig> show significantly higher k
a
/k
s
 ratios than those on cp <dig> and the main chromosome for both the within- and between-species comparisons . the relatively high k
a
/k
s
 ratios of orfs on lp <dig> suggest a high level of adaptive amino-acid variations on this plasmid, an explanation consistent with the high proportion of genes encoding surface-localized lipoproteins on this plasmid including ospa, ospb, dbpa, dbpb, as well as the pfam <dig> array of crasp-1-like genes  <cit> . on all three replicons, the within-species k
a
/k
s
 ratios are greater than the between-species k
a
/k
s
 ratios , a higher level of amino-acid variations within- than between-species may be a result of slightly deleterious mutations within bacterial populations  <cit> . it is also possibly due to the fact that some amino-acid variations  are beneficial and selectively maintained within b. burgdorferi s.s. populations. further investigation  is needed to evaluate these possibilities.

adaptive genome radiation as population expands
while evolutionarily stable, as b. burgdorferi s.l. populations expand its genomes are expected to diversify rapidly through sequence and copy-number variations at host-interacting loci such as ospc. mathematical analysis showed that the mean coalescence time of n segregating alleles at a locus under balancing selection is extended–relative to the neutral expectation–by a scaling factor: e{t
n
} = 2n
e
f
s
 , where n
e
 is the effective population size and f
s
 is the scaling factor that increases with selection intensity  <cit> . the same analysis suggested rapid emergence of new alleles at such a locus as a population grows. for example, when selection is strong and the population size  is large, the time for emergence of new alleles at such a locus in a diploid population is a small fraction of 2n generations or, more precisely, in the order of 1/ , where m=n
e
μ, s=2n

s, μ is the mutation rate, and s is the selection coefficient  <cit> . the time for the emergence of r new alleles at the same locus is given by the formula tr=12m∑j=1j=r1−e−2sjj+11−e−sjn  in the unit of 2n
e
 <cit> . to predict how the genomic diversity of the lyme pathogen would be affected by the on-going population expansion of b. burgdorferi s.s. in north america  <cit> , we simulated genome evolution under a model of immune escape and frequent recombination   <cit> . consistent with the above theoretical expectations, the steady-state sequence diversity at immune-escape loci increases proportionally with the population size  and the number of distinct genomic lineages increases correspondingly . these theoretical and simulation analyses may be used to estimate key population-genetic parameters of the lyme disease endemics such as the effective population size, time since colonization, and time for emergence of new genomic groups. for example, the mutation parameter of b. burgdorferi s.s. in northeastern u.s. could be estimated from nucleotide diversity at the ribosomal rna spacer  loci, because simulations on the effects of intra-genic recombination showed a gradual decay of f
s
 towards one  at loci with increasing distances from the selection target  <cit> . since m=2n

 generations, which is fifty thousand years if we assume b. burgdorferi replicates  <dig> generations per year. the rise of the first new ospc allele would take about  <dig> years based on eq. <dig>  both of these time estimates would be considerably shortened by taking into consideration the fact that the intragenic recombination rate is three times the mutation rate  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the genome sequences of  <dig> b. burgdorferi s.l. isolates. this information was used to generate snp trees of the chromosome and the most conserved plasmids cp <dig> and lp <dig>  these trees robustly show phylogenetic relationships among these isolates both within and among different species. our results show that b. burgdorferi s. s. and b. “finlandensis” form a closely related group, as do b. garinii and b. “bavariensis”. b. bissettii is rather closely related to b. burgdorferi s.s., but b. “finlandensis” is the closest known outgroup of b. burgdorferi s.s. b. afzelii and b. spielmanii form a robust  group, and b. valaisiana is not especially closely related to any of the other species analyzed here. these findings are largely in agreement with previous studies using only a few sequences from each isolate, but they provide a statistically much more robust and quantitative description of these relationships. we also find that, despite fairly frequent within-population recombination, the b. burgdorferi s.s. isolates fall into four well-supported groups.

we conclude that the intra- and inter-specific pan-genome sizes of b. burgdorferi s.l. depend strongly on its phylogenetic history. by taking phylogenetic relatedness among pathogen genomes into consideration, phylogeny-guided pan-genome analysis removes sampling artifacts in traditional approaches based on genome numbers and yields robust predictions on the pan-genome sizes of pathogens as well as their rates of gene acquisition. b. burgdorferi s.l. has a highly stable genome, with one of the lowest gene-acquisition rates and one of the largest core genome among bacterial pathogens. adaptive genome differentiation between and within b. burgdorferi s.l. species is driven mostly by copy-number and sequence variations rather than by gains and losses of lineage-specific virulence genes. finally, we predict a rapid emergence of novel ospc groups in areas newly colonized by b. burgdorferi s.l. due to a lack of molecular clock to calibrate the time scale of sequence evolution, however, it remains a challenge to estimate a time scale and the rate of such emergence of new genomic groups in local b. burgdorferi s.l. populations.
