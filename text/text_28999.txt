BACKGROUND
microarray techniques have changed the practice of detecting messenger rna  expression of a single gene to the current stage of simultaneously measuring the expression of thousands of genes. daily improvement in this technology also stimulates techniques that lead to new bioassays. among them, and of particular interest, is a recent development that enables the collection of genomic information from exfoliated colonocytes in fecal matter. it is known that early detection of cancerous colon cells results in high cure and survival rates among colon cancer patients. however, people tend to shy away from invasive procedures such as the colonoscopy. consequently, it is of great interest to develop non-invasive early detection instruments. although evidence exists in the fecal platform that partially degraded mrna in fecal samples can produce meaningful measurements <cit> , and davidson et al.  <cit>  and kanaoka et al.  <cit>  suggest that it is possible to isolate intact fecal eukaryotic mrna, it is unknown whether one can expect the same quality from the large amount of fecal microarray data. the current study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first one that investigates and reports the reproducibility of fecal microarray data. in a proof-of-principle study conducted by human nutrition scientists at texas a&m university, one main task is to find out whether one can expect the same level of reproducibility in the fecal platform as that observed in the mucosal platform where biological samples were taken from colon cells. because of biological variation, two gene expression values of the same gene taken from the same subject are most likely not the same. in order to determine if one can successfully obtain the same findings when an experiment is repeated, it is important to investigate whether the gene expression levels of a gene from the same subject behave more similarly to each other than to those of the same gene from different subjects. the signal is strongest and the reproducibility is highest when the outcomes can be perfectly repeated when a different set of measurements are taken from the same subjects. it is expected that due to mrna degradation, a larger proportion of genes in the fecal platform would possess no or lower reproducibility than those in the mucosal platform. however, it is of interest to understand the quality of those genes which are not degraded in the fecal platform.

generally, replicates are samples collected from the same subject that are processed separately and independently after sample collection. our replicates differ because the "same" biological samples are separately processed only right before the hybridization. the former "replicates" are often collected to evaluate the quality of microarray techniques, while we are truly interested in biological reproducibility at the subject level. this subtle difference is particularly important; some genes could be preserved in one sample but are degraded in another even when both samples are from the same subject. it is the genes with low possibility to be degraded that we are interested in. while we focus only on subject to subject variation, we acknowledge that there are other types of replication in gene expression data <cit> .

in order to assess the agreement between measurements from microarray data collected from the same subject, we use the intraclass correlation coefficient  as a reliability index. the use of icc in genomic study was promoted by carrasco and jover <cit> .

under each platform, we compute a single icc value for each gene. one key advantage of icc as a statistical tool for evaluating reproducibility for different platforms/instruments is that it does not require two platforms/instruments to be evaluated under the same treatment design. in most biological experiments, researchers tend to conduct the second experiment with modifications and improvements rather than simply to repeat what has been done before. consequently, a statistical tool for evaluating reproducibility has to have the flexibility to accommodate this common practice. in order to fulfill this requirement, the icc values were computed after removing the treatment effects. the single index recorded per gene uses variance components analysis to compare the measurement-similarity for samples taken from the same subject/rat versus the measurement-similarity for samples taken from different subjects/rats. we report the methodology for calculating icc in the methods subsection.

the larger the value of icc, the more differentiation among measurements collected from different biological samples relative to that among readings collected from the same biological material. an icc value near  <dig> signifies a strong indication of reproducibility and agreement between experiments. if the icc is near  <dig>  then within-subject variance is relatively large compared to between-subject variance and it is likely that one cannot obtain the same expression level in a repeated experiment.

in both the mucosal and the fecal genes, we observe at least a small proportion of genes that always have low reproducibility; their existence results in a mixture model for the distribution of icc values. it is common practice to use finite mixture modeling in bioinformatics research. the reasons tend to be twofold: to accommodate measurement heterogeneity and to identify potentially meaningful subgroups. the most popular approach is the use of finite normal mixtures  <cit> . allison et al. and ji et al. use beta-mixture modeling to describe distributional properties of different genes' correlation coefficients <cit> . like measurements of icc, the values of correlation coefficients are between  <dig> and  <dig>  for the same type of data, mclachlan et al. prefer the use of normal-mixture distributions which eliminates the -range constraint <cit> .

in a study comparing the fecal and mucosal bioassay platforms, we obtained different proportions for the mixture components when we modeled the probit transformed icc  values with a two-component normal-mixture distribution and when we modeled the icc values with a two-component beta-mixture distribution. it was our conjecture that, considering the boundary problem of beta distribution modeling, the normal-mixture modeling might be less sensitive toward model mis-specification. we observed the lower component of the beta mixture to be strictly decreasing with the density f approaching infinity as y approaches  <dig>  this phenomenon likely caused the maximum likelihood estimate  of β-parameters to be unstable. we conduct a sequence of numerical studies to compare the two approaches.

our ultimate goal is to select the better of the two systems to ascertain whether the "reproducible" component in the fecal array samples share similar properties to those of the mucosal array samples.

RESULTS
data sets
gene expression levels from the colon mucosal and fecal data samples were collected using codelink microarrays . the main dataset under study here consisted of  <dig> genes for the fecal data and  <dig> genes for the mucosal data. due to the fact that the bioassays that were used to extract fecal mrna were developed later, the mucosal data we used were collected much earlier in a different experiment. in fact, we did not have access to the original muscosal dataset. we were able to use the available summary statistics to produce icc measurements. all measurements  were collected from spraque dawley rats.

fecal data
the fecal array data were collected from rat fecal samples in a study designed to explore the effect that diet has on genes being differentially expressed after exposure to carcinogen/radiation. a normalization procedure was developed <cit> . rats in the study were exposed to carcinogen azoxymethane  and randomly assigned to one of four different treatments resulting from a  <dig> ×  <dig> factorial design. the two experimental factors were diet - fish oil/pectin  and corn oil/cellulose , and radiation - with radiation exposure  and without radiation exposure . fecal samples were collected  <dig> weeks after the last exposure to carcinogen aom. there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bioarrays collected under irt-d <dig>  irt-d <dig>  rct-d <dig>  and rct-d <dig>  respectively. genes that were not disqualified with at least  <dig> usable replicates were kept.

mucosal data
rats used in the study to obtain mucosal array data were randomly assigned in a  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> factorial experiment to a treatment with diet, exposure, and time points as factors <cit> . corn oil/n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acid  or fish oil/n- <dig> pufa or olive oil/n- <dig> monounsaturated fatty acid  was used as the dietary fat source; carcinogen aom or saline was used as the exposure source; time points were either  <dig> hours or  <dig> weeks after the first injection. the units were terminated at the appropriate time point in order to remove the mucosal layer from each colon so that rna could be extracted from the mucosal samples. the numbers of arrays for corn, fish, and olive oil diets under aom or saline treatments were  and , respectively for the 12-hour study and were  and , respectively for the 10-week study.

matched subset
to address the issue of reproducibility for a finite list of common genes between the platforms, we conducted an additional study referred to as the "matched subset" throughout. we were able to retrieve the ncbi gene information from the mucosal experiments and used them to create a matched subset in which the two subsets  were collected from the same genes. each subset contains  <dig> measurements.

preliminary application to the main dataset
the original icc values were fitted with a two-component beta-mixture using an em algorithm, producing the following density estimation for the fecal and mucosal data,  and , respectively:  

and  

we obtained the following estimated two-component normal-mixture densities,  and , for the probit transformed fecal and mucosal icc measurements, respectively:  

and  

the observation of the difference in proportion estimates for fecal and mucosal data leads us to question the accuracy of the two fits. it is unclear what the proportion of reproducible genes  for the fecal samples should be,  <dig>  or  <dig> ? unfortunately, the answer to this question depends on the mixture model we use to fit the data. it is well known that when α <  <dig> , values of the beta distribution strictly increase to infinity at the lower  endpoint. we find α is much smaller than  <dig> with the lower components of the beta mixtures for both datasets. this phenomenon is easily seen in the graphs displayed in figure  <dig> where we plot the fitted beta-mixture superimposed on the histogram of icc values for the fecal and mucosal data. because the beta distribution has such a boundary issue, we suspect that a simple violation of the distributional assumption near the boundary could have profound effects on maximum likelihood estimates. in comparison, the fitted normal-mixture superimposed on the histogram of pt-icc values is plotted in figure  <dig>  it is worth noting that the visual evaluation of figures  <dig> and  <dig> might not be helpful to the comparisons of these two modeling approaches. we investigate the veracity of the comparisons with numerical studies. in light of the numerical outcomes from our monte carlo investigation, we plotted three estimated density functions in figure  <dig>  the solid curves in each plot of figure  <dig> provide the kernel estimated density functions of the fecal and mucosal pt-icc values. the estimated density functions based on the normal-mixture models are given by the dashed lines. finally, the estimated density function calculated using the transformation theory gave the estimated density functions of pt-icc values shown by the dotted lines. even though not perfectly, the kernel density estimates and the normal-mixture based estimates correspond roughly well with each other. however, the transformed beta-mixture based density estimates misfit the lower mixture component for the mucosal data. for fecal data, this approach almost concluded that there was a single component - a feature which could not be clearly seen in figure  <dig> 

monte carlo assessments
to investigate the sensitivity of each of the two mixture modeling approaches to distributional mis-specification, we conduct monte carlo simulation studies to mimic what we observed in the fecal and mucosal microarray data sets. simulation for the fecal data is described as follows:

simulation scenario #1: data generated from beta-mixtures, fit with normal-mixtures

 generate y <dig>  ..., yn from  =  <dig>  beta +  <dig>  beta.

 transform y <dig>  ..., yn using the probit transformation and fit the pt-icc measurements with a two-component normal-mixture model.

simulation scenario #2: data generated from normal-mixtures, fit with beta-mixtures

 generate x <dig>  ..., xn from  =  <dig>  n  +  <dig>  n .

 transform x <dig>  ..., xn using the inverse probit transformation and fit the icc data with a two-component beta-mixture model.

we repeated each simulation s =  <dig> times for sample size n =  <dig> and used the em algorithm to obtain the estimates of corresponding parameters. the steps above were repeated for the mucosal dataset where the beta random variables were generated from  =  <dig>  beta +  <dig>  beta and the normal random variables were generated from  =  <dig>  n  +  <dig>  n .

we could not compare the outcomes of simulations # <dig> and # <dig> directly when the estimated parameters were for normal-mixtures and beta-mixtures, respectively. to ease the comparisons, we chose to transform the resulting estimates in simulation # <dig> so that the outcomes correspond to means and variances of distributions that would give observations on the whole real line, and then produced the monte carlo statistics corresponding to the two components. summary statistics for simulation scenarios # <dig> and # <dig> are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. we identified the targeted parameter values in each scenario as "truth" and reported the monte carlo mean, bias, standard deviation, and square-root of mean squared error  of the estimates. when comparing the true parameters with the estimates obtained from the fit of the assumed distribution, we find that summary statistics from fitting transformed normal random variables with a beta-mixture closely resemble the phenomenon observed when analyzing the fecal and mucosal data. namely, it is the case that although the true proportions for the upper components of the fecal and mucosal data are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, estimates of πu resulting from the fit of two-component beta distribution average  <dig> . in contrast, modeling the simulated pt-icc by normal-mixtures when the icc values were generated from the beta-mixtures, as described in simulation scenario # <dig>  is much less sensitive toward the distributional mis-specification. this led us to believe that the use of the two-component normal-mixture model on pt-icc is the more reliable approach of the two. we further analyzed the simulated outcomes and compared the sensitivity of each modeling approach toward distributional mis-specification through performing goodness-of-fit tests against assumed models.

summary statistics of simulation scenario # <dig>  monte carlo mean, bias, standard deviation, and square-root mse  of upper mixture proportion μu, upper mixture mean μu and variance , and lower mixture mean μl and variance  from scenario # <dig> 

precisely, for each simulated data set, we let the null hypothesis, h <dig>  be that the observed icc  values were from the assumed model. we then compared the observed and expected counts of observations within k bins, where k =  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  using pearson's chi-square goodness-of-fit test with significance level α =  <dig>  and k -  <dig> degrees of freedom. the exact procedure of the test is described in the methods subsection. analysis of goodness-of-fit test statistics resulting from the simulation studies are given in table  <dig>  ideally, if the h <dig> was true, there should be no more than 5% chance to reject the h <dig> when α =  <dig> . except when k =  <dig>  the proportions of tests that rejected h <dig> with normal-mixture modeling are all less than the nominal level of  <dig> . further, in all cases, the outcomes obtained by normal-mixture modeling were comparable between the two  true underlying distributions. the same did not hold for beta-mixture modeling. when the data were not generated according to the beta-mixture scheme, the goodness-of-fit tests were rejected close to or equal to 100% throughout. that is, the best fits of beta-mixtures still could not provide sufficiently close approximations that could pass the goodness-of-fit tests under simulation scenario # <dig> 

icc comparisons of fecal and mucosal data
since our findings from the simulation studies suggested that we use a two-component normal-mixture to fit the probit transformed icc values, we adopted this strategy and utilized it to compare reproducibility under the fecal and mucosal array platforms. we associate the two components of high  icc values with reproducible  genes; see the discussion subsection for more considerations.

we also let, for the fecal and mucosal data, πlf and πlm be the proportions of the mixture components consisting of irreproducible genes, and μuf and μum be the means of the mixture component with higher icc values. we reported two main studies that were conducted for the purpose of exploring the extent of the distributional differences between the two platforms. throughout, we used bootstrap methods described in the methods subsection. the first bootstrap analysis is designed to find the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of irreproducible genes contained in each data set, πlf - πlm. in the second analysis, we identify the 95% confidence interval for the average difference in the mixture components with higher icc values, μuf - μum. the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for the two studies were  for πlf - πlm, and  for μuf - μum. as a result, we concluded that while the fecal array had a higher proportion of irreproducible genes, its average icc values for the reproducible component of genes was a little higher than that obtained from the mucosal platform.

outcomes for analysis of matched subset
we now repeat the numerical investigation above but replace the main dataset by the matched subset in which fecal and mucosal measurements were collected from the same genes. the icc measurements from the matched subset were fitted with a two-component beta-mixture using an em algorithm, producing the following density estimation for the fecal and mucosal data,  and , respectively:  

and  

where the additional upper index "s" stands for "subset." we also obtained the following estimated two-component normal-mixture densities,  and , for the probit transformed fecal and mucosal icc measurements from the matched subset, respectively:  

and  

there were two immediate observations from this sub-study. first, even though the proportions of two components differ from those in the main study, for the pt-icc values, the estimated parameters correspond fairly well to those from the main study. that is, we obtained almost the same lower and upper components in the normal-mixture modeling as in the main study. on the other hand, the estimated parameter values changed quite dramatically for the beta-mixture modeling. second, for the mucosal subset, the estimated proportions for the two approaches are almost identical whether the data was fitted by a beta-mixture or a normal-mixture. in fact, by producing a figure equivalent to figure  <dig>  in figure  <dig> we note that the two estimation procedures reach the same conclusion for this estimation ). however, the outcomes produced by beta-mixture modeling remains to be unsatisfactory for the fecal samples. we also obtained the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for  and , where the parameters were equivalently defined as in the main study. the two 95% confidence intervals were  and , respectively. they further confirm that, for this matched subset, while the fecal array had a higher proportion of irreproducible genes, its average icc values for the reproducible component of genes was a little higher than that obtained from mucosal samples.

discussion
there are a few points worth making here. the key problem behind the instability of beta-mixture modeling is that one might attempt to estimate the worst component of the mixture distribution with a small proportion of data observed on the boundary. the specifics of simulation scenarios # <dig> and # <dig> were based on our analysis of the original subset of icc values. we expect the same difficulties would be encountered in the beta-mixture modeling if we have a high density of icc values close to  <dig> at the upper component. to investigate this conjecture, we conducted an additional simulation study and report the outcomes in the "additional file  <dig> " we found that the beta-mixture less accurately fit the transformed normal data when the mixture had a high density of values near  <dig>  however, the beta-mixture had no problems fitting transformed normal data resulting from a beta-mixture with no asymptotes at the boundary. there was less distinction between the quality of the fits when the normal-mixture was used to fit pt-icc data. again, suggesting that two-component normal-mixture modeling on pt-icc is a more reliable approach.

although it is not obvious to interpret the meaning of the estimated parameters, from the normal mixture modeling in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the cut-off between the two mixture components is around - <dig>  this roughly corresponds to the scenario of an icc = 5%. by pure randomness, even though the true correlation could be zero, one could observe a non-zero sample correlation of 5% or less. from our numerical analyses on the fecal microarray data, the proportion of icc values less than 5% range from 20% to 28%. the proportion of genes with icc values less than 5% for the fecal and mucosal samples are 25% and 20%, respectively in the main study, and are 22% and 18%, respectively for the matched study. these numbers again match better with the outcomes from the normal-mixture modeling.

finally, we conducted another simulation study using the estimated parameters from the matched subset. the exact setup and outcomes are reported in "additional file  <dig> " for the mucosal subset of icc values, we find equivalent results between the beta-mixture approach and the normal-mixture approach. however, results from the simulation study show unsatisfactory performances under the scenario of "data generated from normal-mixtures, fit with beta-mixtures". our mucosal matched subset is most likely beta-mixture distributed.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have demonstrated that when analyzing icc values of gene expression levels, it is a better strategy to first probit-transform the icc values onto the  domain and then to model the pt-icc values with a normal-mixture model. through this practice, we were able to obtain outcomes that were less sensitive toward distributional assumptions. we avoided the problem of estimating parameters for a beta distribution which increases to infinity at the boundary. our investigations suggested that even though there tended to be a higher proportion of genes that had low reproducibility in the fecal array data than in the mucosal array data, the average icc values for those genes which possessed relatively high icc values in the fecal data was even a bit higher than the corresponding average observed in the mucosal platform. we also note that the probit transformation strategy enables us to easily adopt the mixture of normal modeling approach that can be carried out by mclust packages in r or splus.
