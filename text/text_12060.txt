BACKGROUND
dna methylation plays a critical role in a large variety of cellular processes by controlling gene transcription via gene silencing. methylation in most animals occurs at the level of cytosines within the sequence cpg, although low levels of non-cpg methylation have been reported in some species. in mammals, there are two classes of dna  methyltransferases, de novo and maintenance methyltransferases. the de novo methyltransferase in mammals has two isoforms, dnmt3a and dnmt3b  <cit> . the maintenance methyltransferase, dnmt <dig>  is the most prevalent dna methyltransferase found in cells. dnmt <dig> has several isoforms, including an oocyte-specific isoform that lacks the first  <dig> amino acids  <cit>  and a splice variant known as dnmt1b  <cit> . maintenance methylation ensures the propagation of tissue-specific methylation patterns established during mammalian development. while the dnmt <dig> enzymes have a preference for hemimethylated dna  <cit> , dnmt3a and dnmt3b act on either hemimethylated or unmethylated dna. thus, the pattern of mammalian methylation is established and maintained by a set of at least three different dna methyltransferases.

at present, the signaling cascade by which dna methylation patterns are imprinted is unclear. connections between signaling cascades and epigenetic modifications have recently been unraveled by studies showing that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /protein kinase b  signaling pathway regulates the protein level of dnmt <dig>  protecting it from degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit> . the idea that dnmt <dig> activity could be regulated at the post-translational level through phosphorylation by a serine/threonine kinase was supported by mass spectrometry studies, which reported phosphorylation sites on the serine and threonine residues located in the n-terminal domain  <cit> . this region of dnmt <dig> fulfills several regulatory functions by interacting with proteins such as lsh, ezh <dig>  uhrf <dig>  g9a, dmap <dig> , hdac <dig> , hp1β, pcna, and rb  <cit> . recently, hervouet et al.   <cit>  have demonstrated that the disruption of dnmt1/pcna/uhrf <dig> interactions promote a global dna hypomethylation in human gliomas. they also found that such interactions were regulated by the phosphorylation status of dnmt <dig> since phosphorylation of human dnmt <dig> by akt and pkc, at the specific residues serine-127/ <dig> and serine- <dig> respectively, correlated with global hypomethylation  <cit> .

the protein kinase c  family consists of ubiquitously expressed phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases, which regulate a large number of physiological processes, including cell growth and differentiation. studies on simple organisms have shown that pkc signaling paradigms are conserved through evolution from yeast to humans. this conservation underscores the importance of this family in cellular signaling and provides novel insight into pkc function in complex mammalian systems. pkc isoenzymes with differential cellular distribution, substrate specificities, and activation responsiveness are divided into three groups: the conventional pkc isoforms, which are activated by calcium, diacylglycerol, and phorbol esters ; the novel pkcs, which are activated by diacylglycerol but are calcium-insensitive  and θ); and the atypical pkcs, which are calcium- and diacylglycerol-insensitive )  <cit> . although each pkc isoform regulates a large number of downstream targets, individual members of the pkc family are, however, regulated in different ways, and an increasing number of studies indicates that they have distinct, and often opposing, roles  <cit> . in fact, it is now well accepted that each of the pkc isoforms is unique in its contribution to specific biological processes  <cit> . whether all pkc isoforms can interact with and phosphorylate dnmt <dig> remains, however, unknown. here, we have examined the ability of pkc isoforms to phosphorylate the human dnmt <dig> 

RESULTS
in vitro phosphorylation of human dnmt <dig> by pkc isoforms
previous studies have demonstrated that human dnmt <dig> is phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine amino acid residues  <cit> . experiments using broad spectrum of inhibitors have shown that such phosphorylation on human dnmt <dig> is dependent on pkc activity  <cit> . since pkc family members have contradictory and tissue specific roles, we have compared their ability to phosphorylate human dnmt <dig>  using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that pkcα, δ, ζ and, to a lower extent pkcμ, were all able to phosphorylate recombinant human dnmt <dig> in a dose-dependent manner . no such phosphorylation was observed with pkcε, although this isoform showed similar activity as compared to other isoforms when tested against a creb peptide . additional evidence of phosphorylation of recombinant full length dnmt <dig> by a pkc isoform was demonstrated by gel autoradiography using pkcζ as a model .

to further compare the ability of pkc isoforms to phosphorylate dnmt <dig>  a series of gst fusions covering the entire length of dnmt <dig> were challenged with recombinant pkc isoforms . these fragments have previously been used to elucidate specific interaction between dnmt <dig> and accessory molecules such as hdnmt3a and hdnmt3b  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit>  and g9a  <cit> . our results showed that all pkc isoforms preferentially phosphorylated the n-terminal domain  of dnmt <dig> . pkcε was inefficient in its ability to phosphorylate the n-terminal domain . such inability of pkcε to phosphorylate dnmt <dig> was not restricted to amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> since only negligible phosphorylation of other dnmt <dig> fragments was observed when compared to the ability of other isoforms . these results were consistent with the preferential binding of pkcζ, used here as a prototype model, with the n-terminal domain of dnmt <dig> . a lower but reproducible binding was also observed between pkcζ and the c-terminal domains of dnmt <dig> encompassing amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> .

dnmt <dig> colocalizes with pkcζ in vivo
colocalization experiments were carried out by fluorescent microscopy in dsred-dnmt1-transfected hela cells, which were stained with an antibody specific for the activated form of endogenous pkcζ. red nuclear spots appeared in all of the transfectants, which was consistent with the localization of dnmt <dig> in the nucleus . green nuclear spots identifying the endogenous activated form of pkcζ were also visible in the nucleus . superimposition of gfp and dsred-dnmt <dig> signals resulted in yellow nuclear spots, demonstrating colocalization of dnmt <dig> and pkcζ . further evidence of an in vivo physical interaction between dnmt <dig> and pkc was provided by immunoprecipitates of c-myc-pkcζ obtained from nuclear extracts and probed by western blots with anti-dnmt <dig> antibody. physical interaction between dnmt <dig> and pkcζ was demonstrated by the presence of dnmt <dig> in pkcζ-c-myc immunoprecipitates . dnmt <dig> and pkcζ were not detected in control immunoprecipitation experiments using cells transfected with a c-myc expression control vector. furthermore, endogenous pkcζ activity was detected in immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-dnmt <dig> antibody, but not from immunoprecipitates using an isotypic igg antibody . together, these results confirmed the interaction between dnmt <dig> and pkcζ in hek- <dig> cells.

overexpression of pkcζ and dnmt <dig> induces dna hypomethylation of gene promoters
a recent study has reported that phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> is associated with a global dna hypomethylation and a poor prognosis in gliomas  <cit> . to determine whether interactions between pkcζ and dnmt <dig> could also induce genome-wide changes in other cell types, the dna methylation status on broad genomic regions were examined in hek- <dig> cells overexpressing pkcζ and/or dnmt <dig>  or control cells, including cells treated with the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine  . for this purpose, genomic dna was immunoprecipitated with an antibody against 5-methyl-cytosine and hybridized against affymetrix promoter  <dig>  tilling arrays covering  <dig> to  <dig>  kb regions  of  <dig>  human gene promoters, with an average tilling resolution of  <dig> nucleotides. analysis of the signals generated by such arrays showed an estimated  <dig>  methylated regions in hek- <dig> cells. most of the methylated dna regions identified corresponded to cpg islands . in fact, of the  <dig>  methylated regions,  <dig>  were in cpg islands. fifteen regions were selected for quantitative analysis of the methylation status by quantitative pcr  based on : 1) their distinct position on the chromosomes, 2) the presence of a cpg island within the active region, and 3) their location upstream of a gene known to be regulated by dna methylation  . methylated dna query, using specific primers for each gene showed that most, if not all, of the genes analyzed had a significant reduction in their methylation status in cells overexpressing pkcζ and dnmt <dig>  but not in cells overexpressing either pkcζ or dnmt <dig> alone . this reduction in the methylation status was comparable to that observed in cells treated with the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-dc. this decrease in dna methylation status was observed on  <dig> genes dispersed on nine different chromosomes. moreover, all genes, whether harboring low, medium, or high levels of methylated regions, were susceptible to the overexpression of pkcζ and dnmt <dig>  furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> by pkcζ strongly reduced its methyltransferase activity , which was consistent with the decrease in dna methylation observed in cells overexpressing dnmt <dig> and pkcζ.

discussion
in the present report, we have characterized the relation between pkc isoforms and human dnmt <dig>  more specifically, we found that: 1) pkcα, βi, βii, δ, γ, η, ζ and μ preferentially phosphorylate the n-terminal domain of human dnmt1; no such phosphorylation was observed with pkcε; 2) pkcζ and dmnt <dig> physically interact in vivo in the nucleus of hek- <dig> and hela cells; 3) pkcζ activity could be detected in dnmt <dig> immunoprecipitates of endogenous dnmt1; and 4) overexpression of pkcζ and dnmt <dig> in hek- <dig> cells induces a decrease in dna methylation, consistent with our results showing that phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> by pkcζ reduces its methyltransferase activity. overall, these results provide novel insights on the ability of pkc isoforms to play a role in controlling dna methylation.

in a recent study, the use of broad spectrum inhibitors have suggested that phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> likely involves akt and pkc  <cit> . here, we provide additional evidence that pkc and dnmt <dig> physically interact and regulate dna methylation. overall, our experiments have shown that most pkc isoforms, including pkcα, β, γ, δ, η and ζ, are able to phosphorylate, albeit with different efficiency, the n-terminal region of human dnmt <dig>  in fact, the preferential ability of pkc isoforms to interact with and phosphorylate the region encompassing amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> are consistent with previous results showing preferential phosphorylation of serine <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, pkcε and, to a lesser degree pkcμ, were inefficient in their ability to phosphorylate dnmt <dig> or its n-terminal domain. such differential phosphorylation by pkc has often been observed. for example, phosphorylation of ser <dig> of cav <dig>  α1c, but not ser <dig>  is pkc isoform specific, as only pkcα, βi, βii, γ, δ and θ, but not pkcε, ζ and η, phosphorylate this site  <cit> . although it is currently unclear why pkcε is unable to phosphorylate dnmt <dig>  our observations provide an interesting experimental model to investigate further the functional interaction between pkc isoforms and dnmt <dig> 

pkc participates in a multitude of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis  <cit> . increasing evidence has implicated pkc isoforms in nuclear functions, suggesting that they could represent a pathway to communicate to the nucleus signals generated at the plasma membrane  <cit> . for example, in pc <dig> cells, pkcζ has been found at the inner nuclear matrix of the nucleus  <cit> , where dna replication gene expression and protein phosphorylation take place  <cit> . pkcζ has also been located in the nucleus of rat h9c <dig> cells during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia  <cit> . here we provide further evidence of the presence of activated pkcζ in the nucleus of hela cells and of hek- <dig> cells, indicating that translocation of pkcζ into the nucleus is a common mechanism not restricted to a specific cell type. our attempts to demonstrate an interaction between endogenous dnmt <dig> and pkcζ by co-immunoprecipitation were, however, unsuccessful, most likely due to low expression level of dnmt <dig>  using a more sensitive approach, we were able to show pkcζ-specific activity in immunoprecipitates of endogenous dnmt <dig>  supporting our hypothesis that endogenous dnmt <dig> and pkcζ could be found in the same complex within the nucleus. this hypothesis is also supported by our data showing that flagged dnmt <dig> interacts with the endogenous form of pkcζ. whether nuclear pkcζ stands in close proximity of dnmt <dig>  ready to act in proliferative cells, is not known. this could be, however, a very effective means to rapidly regulate dnmt <dig> activity when necessary. a similar paradigm has recently been proposed from studies on the regulation of dnmt <dig> protein stability through the coordinated interaction of an array of dnmt1-associated proteins, such as uhrf <dig>  tip <dig>  and haus   <cit> .

given its preferential ability to phosphorylate the n-terminal domain of dnmt <dig>  pkcζ may contribute to the formation of multimolecular complexes copying the dna methylation pattern from a parental to a replicated dna strand. several proteins have indeed been reported to interact with dnmt <dig> via its n-terminal domain, including pcna, which recruits dnmt <dig> at the mammalian dna replication forks  <cit> . other proteins, such as hdac and dmap <dig>  <cit>  initiate the formation of dna replication complexes at the replication fork to mediate transcriptional repression. dnmt <dig> has also been associated with methyl-cpg-binding proteins such as mbd <dig>  mbd <dig> and mecp <dig> to maintain dna methylation  <cit> . histone methyltransferases and hp <dig> have been recently found to interact with dnmt <dig>  showing a direct connection between the enzymes responsible for dna methylation and histone methylation  <cit> . furthermore, dnmt <dig> can interact with cell cycle regulating proteins such as rb and p <dig>  <cit> . it is pertinent to note that pkcζ has been shown to interact with and to phosphorylate dna-bound sp <dig>  thereby causing the release of the repressor p <dig> on the luteinizing hormone receptor gene promoter in tsa-treated mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . because sp <dig> interacts with hdac1/2/msin3a on the luteinizing hormone receptor gene promoter in both hela and mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> , and hdac1/ <dig> binds to dnmt <dig>  <cit> , it is thus possible that pkcζ could interact with dnmt <dig> on the promoter via the sp1/repressor complex. additional studies will be required to test these possibilities.

phosphorylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications occurring in animal cells. the previous observations that human dnmt <dig> was phosphorylated in vivo were indicative that at some point, dnmt <dig> was interacting with yet unidentified serine/threonine kinases. the results from previous mass spectrometry studies suggested that several phosphorylation sites were targeted depending on the activation status of the cell and/or the cell type  <cit> , while ser <dig> and ser <dig> were shown to be the major phosphorylation sites in hek- <dig> cells  <cit> , ser <dig>  ser <dig> and ser <dig> in jurkat cells  <cit>  and ser <dig> in lung cancer cells  <cit> . although it is unclear at present whether distinct phosphorylation sites are targeted by pkc isoforms in different cell types, it is likely that ser <dig> is preferentially targeted  <cit> . examination of the phosphorylation profile of human dnmt <dig> reveals, however, the presence of several alternative phosphosites for pkc isoforms, including some located in the c-terminal regions of dnmt <dig>  future investigations will be necessary to identify the specific phosphorylation sites in different cell types and different states.

we found that the overexpression of pkcζ along with dnmt <dig> in hek- <dig> cells led to a decrease in dna methylation and that phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> by pkcζ reduced its methyltransferase activity in vitro. our preliminary data indicate that these changes in the methylation status may not, however, be sufficient to induce or modulate gene expression. for example, no significant changes in egr <dig> mrna expression were observed . this may not be surprising because dna hypomethylation of the promoter does not always result in increased gene expression. moreover, in cancer cells, although gene-specific hypomethylation occurs, much of the effect of global dna hypomethylation are thought to occur through the activation of the normally dormant transposons and endogenous retroviruses present in the human genome  <cit> . the fact that overexpression of pkcζ alone was not sufficient to trigger genome hypomethylation may be explained, in part, by the presence of excess of pkcζ as compared to endogenous dnmt <dig>  unbound pkcζ might also activate signaling pathways critical for cell proliferation, differentiation and survival, such as the erk/mapk pathway, thereby providing a counterbalance to the negative regulation of dnmt <dig>  it is well known that pkcζ can activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway in different cell types  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that inhibition of erk/mapk pathway lead to a decrease in dna methylation in colon cancer cells  <cit> .

our data support the idea that pkc-dnmt <dig> interaction is important in controlling dna methylation, possibly by regulating dnmt <dig> interaction with other proteins, such as uhfr <dig>  as recently suggested  <cit> . this possibility is also supported by data showing that activation of pkc with phorbol ester in mouse hippocampus tissues induced a rapid demethylation of the reelin promoter  <cit> . to date, it was believed that such a role was essentially mediated through the ability of pkc to down-regulate the dnmt expression at the mrna level  <cit> . moreover, sun et al.,  <cit>  have also shown that treatment of hela cells with a specific inhibitor of pi3k, which activates pkc, dnmt <dig> protein level and genomic content of methylated cytosines were decreased in a time-dependent manner without affecting the dnmt <dig> mrna level. whether phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> on specific residues was involved in maintaining the functional integrity of the enzyme is in fact a real possibility because mutations of one of the major phosphorylation sites of murine dnmt <dig>  ser <dig>   <cit> , has been shown to significantly reduce the in vitro enzymatic activity of recombinant dnmt <dig>  <cit> . alternatively, phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> could affect its structural integrity, thereby reducing its dna-binding activity, as shown by sugiyama et al. via in vitro phosphorylation of murine dnmt <dig> by ck1δ  <cit> . it would thus be very interesting to determine, for instance, whether phosphorylation of dnmt <dig> modulates its ability to bind specific endogenous dna sequences, thereby contributing to the overall genome hypomethylation. ideally, however, such experiments will require antibodies that recognize specific pkcζ-mediated phosphorylated residues on human dnmt <dig>  future investigations will be needed to address this issue.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to identify pkc specific isoforms involved in the phosphorylation of dnmt <dig>  indeed, all pkc isoforms except pkcε, which was very inefficient, preferentially phosphorylated the n-terminal domain  of dnmt <dig>  functional implications of dnmt <dig> phosphorylation by pkc isoforms have been highlighted by experiments using pkcζ as a model, which suggested possible roles in the control of dna methylation patterns of the genome, and possibly in the control of gene expression. based on the importance of pkc signaling in a multitude of biological processes and of a tight regulation of dna methylation in normal cells, these findings may provide a novel strategy for cancer therapy.
