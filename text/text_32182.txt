BACKGROUND
first isolated in  <dig>  legionella pneumophila, a gram-negative, intracellular bacterial pathogen is the agent causing the severe form of pneumonia named legionnaires’ disease, as well as the less severe flu-like pontiac fever  <cit> . it has drawn much attention for its capability of intracellular replication in both protozoa and human beings. after the endocytosis by protozoan hosts like amoebae or human alveolar macrophages, the legionella-containing vacuole  inhibits phagolysosomal fusion and recruits mitochondria followed by the association of ribosome-studded membranes that later disguise lcv as endoplasmic reticulum . within this er-like compartment, the bacterium replicates to high numbers and eventually is released through lysing the host cell for the next invasion  <cit> .

during this process, l. pneumophila requires most protein products of  <dig> dot/icm  genes to constitute a type ivb secretion system   <cit> . although neither the composition nor the function of t4bss has been fully understood in l. pneumophila, progress has been achieved in identifying and characterizing the dot/icm proteins. dotc, dotd, dotf, dotg and doth comprise the core of the secretion complex which spans across the bacterial membrane. dotc and dotd are outer-membrane lipoproteins and required for doth to target the outer membrane  <cit> . doth may be the out-membrane channel through which substrates get delivered following the transit from the dotf-dotg inner-membrane proteins with the assistance of the dotl–dotm atpase  <cit> . dotb, also an atpase, interacts with dotl and may play a role in various functions such as the assembly of t4bss, retraction of pili and/or export of substrates  <cit> . icmq participates in the membrane pore formation  <cit> , and icmt is crucial for pore formation-mediated escape of l. pneumophila from protozoan or mammalian cells  <cit> . dotl is proposed to be a type iv coupling protein  of t4bss and interacts with other inner-membrane proteins including dotn, dotm and icms/w, a heterodimer complex functions as t4bss adaptor, to constitute the t4cp subcomplex, a very important complex for t4bss to facilitate substrate secretion  <cit> .

through the t4bss, l. pneumophila secretes a large number of substrate proteins called effectors that interfere with the host pathways to help bacteria evade the endosome-lysosomal pathway and replicate in host cells  <cit> . the effector ralf, which has guanine nucleotide exchange activity and mediates the exchange of gdp for gtp, disturbs vesicle traffic between the er and golgi and further promotes the biogenesis of lcv by modulating the activity and localization of the key intracellular regulator arf <dig>  <cit> . the effector ankb is important for the moorage of k48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins when it is anchored into the phagosome membrane by host-mediated farnesylation and interacts with the scf <dig> e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex. then the k48-linked proteins are degraded and the amino acids are utilized for bacterial intracellular proliferation  <cit> . legk <dig>  whose deletion causes reduced cytotoxicity, and adversely affect the intracellular survival and replication of l. pneumophila, acts as a protein kinase  <cit> . so far more than  <dig> effectors have been identified but many of them are considered functionally redundant, only a few are indispensable for the intracellular proliferation of l. pneumophila, such as mavn and sdha .

during the shift between extracellular and intracellular environments, l. pneumophila encounters different growth conditions and has to respond accordingly to survive. to make the appropriate responses, l. pneumophila has developed a complex network to modulate the transition at different phases. proteolysis has been regarded as an important and precise regulatory mechanism for both eukaryote and prokaryote to adapt to a variety of growth conditions by removing short-lived regulatory proteins, as well as misfolded and damaged proteins  <cit> . it is now clear that cellular proteolysis is carried out by the energy-dependent proteases such as the lon and clp proteases and the eukaryotic 26s proteasome  <cit> . to date, clp protease is the most characterized protease in prokaryotes. it consists of two functional subunits: a cylinder-like proteolytic core named clpp which is widely distributed and highly conserved, and two chaperone rings with atpase activity such as clpa, clpc, clpe or clpx  <cit> . the protease core consists of  <dig> clpp serine peptidase subunits stacked in two heptameric rings, forming an internal chamber in which the active sites are sequestered from the cytoplasm  <cit> . the clp atpases are responsible for the recognition, unfolding and translocation of substrates into the degradation chamber  <cit> .

it is widely accepted that clp proteases are involved in many physiological processes of bacteria. in a range of low gc gram-positive bacteria including bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes and lactococcus lactis, clpp-deficient mutants suffer restricted growth at high temperatures . clpp is also considered as the major determinant for the turnover of bulk proteins in b. subtilis at the transition from exponential stage to competence and further sporulation stages  <cit> . moreover, both clpp and its atpase chaperones play significant roles in virulence expression and regulation in various bacterial pathogens. for instance, s. aureus cells lacking the clpb chaperone are unable to replicate intracellularly in bovine cells  <cit> . the absence of clpp in l. monocytogenes results in the lack of listeriolysin o, a major virulence factor implicated in phagosome lysis  <cit> . our recent research has shown that clpp is required for the transmission traits of legionella pneumophila during the transition in its biphasic life cycle, including some traits associated with virulence such as cytotoxicity and intracellular proliferation in the amoebae host acanthamoeba castellanii  <cit> . in this report, studies were focused on the function of legionella pneumophila clpp in the mammalian cell j774a. <dig> and results revealed that the deletion of clpp severely impaired the bacterial virulence and the translocation of several t4bss effectors though the functional integrity of t4bss was not fully neutralize.

RESULTS
clpp is essential for intracellular proliferation of l. pneumophila in macrophages
we have shown previously that clpp is essential for intracellular multiplication of l. pneumophila in amoebae a. castellanii  <cit> . to investigate whether clpp also affects intracellular proliferation of l. pneumophila in macrophages, the wild type, the clpp-deficient mutant, the constitutive complementation, and the dot/icm-deficient dota mutant strains were grown to the stationary phase and used to infect mus musculus macrophages. the infection was allowed to proceed for 5 days and the intracellular proliferation was evaluated by plating the cell lysate onto bcye plates per 24 h. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the wild type lp02pj and the complemented strain xp02c exhibited essentially identical proliferation rate in j774a. <dig> cells. in contrast, both the clpp-deficient mutant xp02pj and the dota mutant strain lp03pj showed significantly impaired multiplication. these results indicate that clpp is essential for the intracellular growth of l. pneumophila in macrophage.fig.  <dig> intracellular growth of clpp-deficient l. pneumophila strain xp <dig> in j774a. <dig> was impaired. j774a. <dig> cells were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with l. pneumophila at an moi of  <dig>  at each time point, cells were lysed and the cfu was determined by plating dilutions onto bcye plates. the intracellular growth kinetics of lp <dig> , clpp mutant , clpp complemented strain , and dota mutant lp <dig>  were shown. points indicate mean values and error bars indicate standard deviations of three independent experiments



clpp mutant is degraded rapidly upon entry into the host cells
avirulent l. pneumophila strains decrease rapidly in the first hours of phagocytosis  <cit> . because the clpp-deficient strain showed severely reduced cytotoxicity and intracellular replication , it is of interest to explore whether clpp is essential for preventing l. pneumophila from degradation after uptake into host cells. to this end, j774a. <dig> were exposed to the stationary-phase l. pneumophila strains and co-cultures were maintained for 3 h before the cells were lysed. the significantly lower percentage  of bacteria residing within host cells 3 h post infection  demonstrated the impaired survival capability of clpp-deficient mutant after phagocytosis. as a negative control, the dota-deficient mutant lp <dig> similarly exhibited impaired survival capability compared with the wild type strain lp <dig> . these data indicate the rapid degradation of the clpp-deficient bacteria post infection and suggest that clpp mutant cannot escape the host defense systems.fig.  <dig> the l. pneumophila clpp mutant xp <dig> was degraded within 3 h of phagocytosis. j774a. <dig> cells were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with l. pneumophila at an moi of  <dig>  after 3 h, the survival of bacteria was determined by plating dilutions onto bcye plates and calculating the numbers of cfu of l. pneumophila lysed from infected j774a. <dig>  *, p <  <dig> ; **, p <  <dig> . the phagocytosis assay was carried out in triplicate. shown are the averages and standard deviations of three independent counts



the clpp mutant fails to evade the late endosome-lysosomal pathway
to assess whether the clpp-deficient mutant could survive the endosome- lysosomal pathway, the molecular morphology of phagosomes containing l. pneumophila was investigated in j774a. <dig>  lysosomal-associated membrane protein  <dig>  and the texas-red conjugated ovalbumin  were utilized as markers of the late endosome and lysosome, respectively. the wild type strain lp02pj that was grown in broth until it reached exponential phase was used as the negative control  for the lysosome fusion assay because the phagosomes containing dot/icm-deficient dota mutant strain do not acquire lysosomal trov in the first several hours post-infection  <cit> . predictably, the wild type strain lp02pj that can replicate in host cells was excluded from lamp- <dig> stained compartments, while the clpp-deficient mutant xp02pj was frequently colocalized with lamp- <dig> staining, just like the negative control lp03pj . staining results showed that 31 % of the lp02pj-containing phagosomes exhibited detectable lamp- <dig> accumulation, whereas 65 % of the xp02pj-containing phagosomes were lamp- <dig> positive. although higher than that of lp02pj-containing phagosomes , the percentage of lamp- <dig> positive xp02pj-containing phagosomes was still significantly lower than that of lp03pj-containing phagosomes  . similar results were obtained in the lysosome fusion assay in which the percentages of trov positive phagosomes containing lp02pj, xp02pj or eplp02pj were about  <dig>   <dig> or 95 %, respectively . these means were significantly different from each other . based on these findings, we conclude that clpp is important for l. pneumophila to escape the late endosome-lysosomal pathway of mammalian host cells.fig.  <dig> immunofluorescence analysis of the late endosome and lysosome in macrophages infected with l. pneumophila. j774a. <dig> cells were incubated with the wild-type l. pneumophila or mutant strains for 2 h, then fixed and stained with a monoclonal antibody specific to lamp- <dig> or trov to identify the macrophage late endosomes or lysosomes. a phagosomes containing wild-type strain lp02pj were not co-localized with late endosomes, whereas phagosomes containing xp02pj or lp03pj were stained and colocalized with lamp- <dig>  b meanwhile the percentages of l. pneumophila-containing phagosomes fused with the late endosomes were determined. **, p <  <dig> . c the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes was also examined using confocal microscopy and d quantified as above. **, p <  <dig> . the immunofluorescence assay was carried out in triplicate. shown are the averages and standard deviations of three independent counts. the number of j774a. <dig> cells for each count is about 100



loss of clpp does not affect the expression of dot/icm components
to survive and multiply within phagocytic host cells, l. pneumophila manipulates host cellular processes, alters the host endocytic pathway, thereby inhibits rapid phagosome-lysosome fusion and creates a niche for its replication. these are achieved with the help of dot/icm t4bss and effectors  <cit> . in view of this, we presumed it might be the abnormal function of t4bss or interrupted secretion of effectors that caused the impaired survival and intracellular proliferation of the clpp-deficient strain in host cells. to test this hypothesis, we measured the transcription activity of dot/icm genes in  <dig> operon areas  <cit>  by examining the promoter activities of these genes. promoters were fused with gfp reporter gene and transformed into both xp <dig> and lp <dig>  the fluorescence intensities, as well as the expression of doth , doti  and dotg , which have been proved to be components of the dot/icm system  <cit> , were measured. plate patching results showed that there were no significant differences in fluorescence intensities between lp <dig> and xp <dig> harboring the icm-gfp fusion plasmids . the fluorescence in the liquid culture confirmed the results of patching and only a slight reduction of fluorescence intensity  was found in the icmr-gfp-harboring xp02pg <dig>  compared to that in lp02pg <dig> . furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that there were no differences between the expression levels of doth, doti, dotg, icms and icmw in lp <dig> and xp <dig> . taken together, these results indicate that loss of clpp might not significantly influence the expression of the t4bss components of l. pneumophila.fig.  <dig> analysis of the promoter activitiy and the expression of the dot/icm components. a-c promoter activities of  <dig> dot/icm operons were examined through streaking and comparing the bacterial strains harboring the promoter-gfp fusion plasmids on plates. d quantified fluorescence intensities of the wild-type lp <dig> and the clpp mutant xp <dig> harboring icmr:gfp fusion plasmid. there is no statistical difference between the two samples. e western blot analysis of the expression of doth, doti, dotg, icms and icmw in the wild type and the clpp deficient mutant strain. a western blot using antibody to isocitrate dehydrogenase  was used to confirm even protein levels of the samples. shown are the averages and standard deviations of  <dig> to  <dig> independent experiments, each performed in triplicate



the t4bss secretion apparatus is still functional in the l. pneumophila clpp deficient mutant
the dot/icm t4bss system of l. pneumophila consists of  <dig> proteins  <cit> . because not all antibodies to these components are available, we cannot determine whether the t4bss of the clpp deficient mutant still functions normally through western blot analysis. to investigate the integrity of t4bss complex in the clpp mutant, we utilized contact-dependent cytotoxicity assay. it is well comprehended that l. pneumophila triggers contact-dependent cytotoxicity, which is actually caspase-1-mediated or caspase-3-mediated cell death, through delivering flagellin protein into host cells and this process requires a functional dot/icm t4bss complex  <cit> . l. pneumophila strains harboring pjb <dig> were grown to post-exponential phase in broth and co-cultured with j774a. <dig> at an moi of  <dig> and  <dig>  after incubation for 2 h, the permeabilization of cells was detected by the release of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase . at an moi of  <dig>  both the wild type and the complemented strains showed high contact-dependent cytotoxicity and the ldh release was  <dig> and 48 %, respectively. in contrast, the ldh release of the dota-deficient strain lp <dig> was only 9 %. intriguingly, the ldh release of the clpp mutant was 34 % and remained cytotoxic, although it was lower than that of the wild type and the complemented strains  . similar results were observed when the moi was raised to  <dig> . these findings imply that the t4bss complex in the clpp mutant may be still functional and overall integrated.fig.  <dig> the clpp-deficient l. pneumophila still has a functional t4bss. contact-dependent cytotoxicity of the wild-type strain lp <dig>  the clpp mutant xp <dig>  the complemented strain xp02c and the dota mutant lp <dig>  infection was performed at an moi of  <dig> and  <dig>  and cell permeabilization was detected by the release of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase . shown are the averages and standard deviations of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate . and there is no statistical difference between the strains



clpp controls the translocation efficiency of some t4bss effectors
since the t4bss apparatus is still functional in the clpp mutant, we therefore examined if the translocation frequency of effectors is impaired. a well-established reporter gene for translocation assay, cyaa  <cit> , was fused with seven effector coding genes, respectively. the resulting plasmids were transformed into the wild type lp <dig>  the clpp deficient strain xp <dig> and the dota mutant strain lp <dig>  respectively. the recombined strains were then infected j774a. <dig> cells and the fused genes were expressed under iptg-induction for translocation frequency assay. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the camp levels of ralf and legk <dig> showed no difference between lp <dig> and xp <dig>  respectively, whereas the camp levels of sida, sidb, sidd, sidf and legu <dig> in xp <dig> were significantly lower than that in lp <dig>  which decreased to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of that in lp <dig>  respectively. immunoblotting assay showed that all cya fusion proteins were expressed abundantly . these results indicate that the translocation of some t4bss effectors is partly controlled by clpp.fig.  <dig> 
clpp-deficiency impaired the translocation of some effectors. j774a. <dig> cells were infected with the wild type , the dota mutant  and the clpp mutant  l. pneumophila strains expressing the indicated cya hybrid proteins. after 1 h of infection, tissue culture cells were lysed and camp was extracted from the sample. total camp production induced by translocation of the hybrid was quantified using an enzyme-immunoassay system, indicated as pmol. results represent average values of experiments performed in triplicate. **, p <  <dig> 



discussion
in the current study, we found that the l. pneumophila clpp deficient mutant exhibited poor survival and intracellular multiplication in j774a. <dig> cells . furthermore, the mutant strain could not escape the late endosome-lysosomal pathway . thus, consistent with our previous results obtained in the amoebae host a. castellanii  <cit> , clpp may be required for the expression of virulence in l. pneumophila. to investigate how clpp regulates the virulence, we tested whether the deficiency of clpp could affect the component expression and the function of t4bss complex. the  <dig> proteins of dot/icm components may not be significantly affected based on the results of transcriptional activity assay together with immunoblotting analysis . although we did not examine the expression of all  <dig> proteins, the findings that the clpp mutant could still induce contact-dependent cytotoxicity against host cells , together with that both ralf and legk <dig> could be translocated into host cells, indicated that the t4bss function was not compromised seriously in the absence of clpp. however, the fact that the secretion of some effectors was impaired in the clpp-deficient strain suggested that one of the strategies for clpp to affect the virulence of legionella pneumophila is via regulating the translocation of effectors.

the phenotype of clpp-deficient l. pneumophila resembles that of the icms/w mutants, the t4bss chaperone. they all exhibit significantly impaired intracellular replication, but still maintain fair contact-dependent cytotoxicity against host cells   <cit> . moreover, the translocation of three icms/w-mediated effectors  and legu <dig> was impaired obviously in the absence of clpp, and the translocation of non-icms/w-mediated ralf was unchanged without clpp   <cit> . more interestingly, the non-icms/w-mediated effector sidf showed reduced translocation efficiency in clpp-deletion mutant , which was similar in icms/icmw double mutant, and the translocation of sida, sidb and sidd in clpp-deletion mutant was more neutralized than that in icms or icmw single mutant  <cit> . taken together, a hypothesis that clpp-deletion mutant might resemble an absolutely icmsw-abolishing mutant could be proposed. currently, how clpp affects icms/w subcomplex is difficult to be clarified because the expression level of each protein in clpp-deletion mutant is unchanged . previous studies have shown that clpp affects the virulence expression in some gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and l. monocytogenes  <cit> . more details about the virulence regulation by clpp have been revealed in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and yersinia pestis, where clpp governs the protein levels of important virulence-regulating factors for type iii secretory systems , rpos and yoma  <cit> . for pathogens containing t4bss, little information about the association between clp proteases and other virulence-related factors is available. recently studies on the dotl-icmsw coupling subcomplex of l. pneumophila t4bss have revealed that clpap protease is responsible for the degradation of dotl in the absence of icms. briefly, in the absence of icms/w mediation, abundant effector proteins could be trapped within dotl, and subsequently the jamming complex is subjected to specific degradation by clpap  <cit> . interestingly, although dotl degradation by clpp requires specific recognition by clpa, the single deletion of clpa does not affect the intracellular replication or the protein level of dotl  <cit> . thus, it is possible that clpp may affect dotl-icmsw-mediated effector translocation through other processes bypassing clpa. on the one hand, clpp may influence the optimal assembly of t4bss rather than protein expression, especially in dotl-icmsw coupling subcomplex. on the other hand, successful effector translocation mediated by icms/w might need essential cleavage or modification by clpp protease. in the second situation, translocation signal peptides may be involved. up to now, a c-terminal signal peptide has been proven to be essential for the translocation of nearly all t4bss effectors and an internal signal sequence has been found to be important in icms/w-mediated translocation  <cit> . thus, the latter signal peptide may be the possible target of clpp modification or regulation. in our future proposal, the association of clpp with the internal signal peptide in icms/w-mediated effectors needs to be explored, and we also hope to examine the assembly status of the dotl-icmsw subcomplex in clpp-deletion mutant.

it is also possible that the neutralized intracellular replication is partially due to the impaired stress tolerance of clpp-deficient l. pneumophila. in both natural aquatic and intracellular environment, l. pneumophilla would encounter various stresses  <cit> . legitimately, a rapid responding system involving proteolytic procedures would be beneficial to the stress tolerance of l. pneumophilla. studies have revealed that clpp protease plays significant roles in dna repair and other stress responses and helps bacteria adapt to many harsh conditions . likewise, l. pneumophila clpp is required for the stationary-phase resistance against various stresses such as oxidation, acidity, osmotic stress and inappropriate temperatures  <cit> . among these stresses, acid resistance might be the most critical in legionella’s intravacuolar survival. l. pneumophila could neutralize the acidic environment of phagosome and subsequently maintain a nearly neutral-ph vacuole during the first hours of uptake  <cit> . however, about 18 h later l. pneumophila would still encounter the acidic environment when the lcv mature into low-ph and endocytic compartments  <cit> . considering our previous finding that the clpp mutant strain exhibited reduced acid resistance and vulnerable cell surface compared to the wild type strain  <cit> , we wonder whether and how much the “weakness” the clpp mutant displays under unfavorable environments contributes to the disability of virulence expression, this assumption needs deeper exploration.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, our data show that the loss of clpp prevents l. pneumophila from evading the endocytic pathway and replicating in host cells. our results also revealed that the clpp-deficiency affects the translocation of some t4bss effectors without impairing the integrity of t4bss. taken together, l. pneumophila clpp is an indispensable factor for the virulence and the translocation of some t4bss effectors.
