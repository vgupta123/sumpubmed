BACKGROUND
reactive oxygen species  are generated by the partial reduction of oxygen, producing a number of short-lived and highly electrophilic molecules , hydrogen peroxide , among others). these molecules have originally been seen as deleterious but in the last decade a wide array of diverse biochemical functions were assigned to them in several organisms. ros are implicated in important basic biological processes that include cell differentiation, development and motility, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell survival and apoptosis, stress response, gut homeostasis and defense, cell signaling and transcriptional regulation . in drosophila melanogaster, for example, the ros producing dual oxidase gene  seems to play a critical role in gut innate immunity  <cit> . ros can be produced in different ways:  as a side reaction of common enzymatic activity,  exogenous compound induction but also  as a physiological response produced by specialized enzymes. the gene family known as nadph oxidase  is responsible for the physiological production of ros  <cit> . this nox-dependent generation of ros is highly conserved across virtually all multicellular forms of life.

metazoan noxes are divided in three subfamilies . all proteins have two canonical domains that are also shared with ferric reductase enzymes: a heme-containing transmembrane domain and a c-terminal cytoplasmic dehydrogenase  domain, which contains fad and nadph-binding sites  <cit> . the ferric reductase domain is characterized by  <dig> transmembrane α-helices  where four conserved histidine residues  bind two heme molecules. the electrons are transferred from nadph to fad, then to the heme molecules and, finally, to molecular oxygen  which becomes superoxide by partial reduction. besides the canonical domains, members of the duox subfamily also have at least two ef-hand calcium-binding domains and one n-terminal peroxidase-like domain  <cit>  while nox <dig> enzymes have four n-terminal ef-hand calcium binding domains .

during the course of evolution, individual noxes have acquired different regulatory systems  <cit>  as separate cytosolic and membrane bound subunits  <cit> . the activation of nox <dig> has been extensively studied since point mutations in this gene cause the x-linked chronic granulomatous disease   <cit> . this was the first nox gene described and, in mammals, it is expressed in phagocytic cells, producing superoxide  <cit> . however, ros are also produced in a variety of other cell types and tissues  <cit> . in the nox1- <dig> subfamily, all proteins need to be associated with a non-glycosylated integral protein called p22-phox to be active  <cit> . this protein has a cytoplasmic proline-rich region  that helps stabilize the nox enzymes at the membrane  <cit> . nox1- <dig> need other cytosolic proteins and nox <dig> and nox <dig> also need the small gtpase rac to function . nox <dig> enzymes seem to require only p22-phox for basal ros production  <cit> . nox <dig> is constitutively active in the presence of p22-phox  <cit>  simply because the conformation of its dh domain seems to allow the transfer of electrons from nadph to fad  <cit> . in the other two subfamilies, nox <dig> and duox1- <dig>  apart from other proteins, calcium molecules are important for ros production since they are needed for enzyme activation .

in mammals, the most widely studied group so far, there are seven genes  that belong to the different subfamilies of noxes. the presence of nox genes in most eukaryotic groups suggests a common ancestor early in evolution with patterns of expansion and gene loss  <cit> . in metazoa, nox1- <dig> seem to have emerged from ancestral ef-hand containing subfamilies   <cit> . the relationship among the genes within the nox1- <dig> subfamily is somewhat unclear. nox <dig> is present in most groups and was suggested as the ancestral nox1- <dig> in animals  <cit> , however, it has been lost in ecdysozoa . previous studies suggested that nox <dig> appeared in the deuterostomes  but, recently, this gene was found in the genome of the sea anemone nematostella vectensis which indicates an earlier divergence than previously thought  <cit> . nox <dig> seems to be present only in vertebrates and nox <dig> only in mammals and reptiles/birds  <cit> . in arthropods, only nox <dig> and duox genes have been found  <cit> . interestingly, a new gene called noxm was found only in mosquitoes but its origin has not been carefully examined  <cit> .

to date, only a limited number of phylogenetic studies of metazoan noxes have been performed where just a few available arthropod genes  were utilized  <cit> . the most recent study used a whole superfamily approach with deep branching nodes but again, only a few metazoan species were analyzed  <cit> . the noxm gene described for mosquitoes, for example, has been linked to their hematophagous habit  <cit>  and warrants attention. despite its ecological importance and relevance to vector biology, its evolutionary history and functionality have never been looked at. we only know that wolbachia infection in aedes aegypti leads to increased noxm and duox transcript levels and their silencing suppresses the expression of some antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . more recently, park et al.  <dig> also found that eicosanoids seem to mediate ros production by a nox4-like gene in the moth spodoptera exigua  <cit> .

given the role of noxes in insects and how little is known about their evolution in this wide and diverse group of animals, a deeper understanding of their phylogenetic relationship is needed. furthermore, the discovery of the noxm gene raises intriguing questions about its function and evolution in arthropods  <cit> . here, we performed a more extensive analysis that profited by the availability of several recently sequenced arthropod genomes to characterize the evolutionary history of the nox family in arthropods and the structural and functional features of noxm. we performed a thorough search of genomes and transcriptomes, when available, and were able to browse most branches of arthropod phylogeny. furthermore, through bioinformatics and, to some extent, experimental work we show that the functionality features necessary for ros production are present in noxm, a gene closely related to vertebrate nox <dig>  finally, we determined that this gene is not restricted to mosquitoes and is present in a number of arthropod lineages although it has also been lost in many. since noxm is not limited to culicidae  but present in a number of arthropod lineages, we suggest renaming it to nox4-art.

RESULTS
gene searches
sequences encoding putative nox genes were identified from the predicted protein set of  <dig> arthropods, one choanoflagellate, two cnidarians, one sponge, four mollusks, two annelids, six nematodes, one echinoderm, one cephalochordate, one urochordate, and eight vertebrate genomes . this search greatly improves on previous searches of nox genes in invertebrate genomes, especially nematodes, mollusks, annelids and arthropods; the latter being the main focus of this work. the searches and posterior gene structure analysis of all genes in all genomes  revealed a total of  <dig> duox,  <dig> nox <dig>   <dig> nox4/nox4-art,  <dig> nox <dig>   <dig> nox <dig> and  <dig> nox <dig> genes. additional file  <dig> summarizes the organisms analyzed and number of copies of nox genes found in each genome and their source . we found that in only four cases the automated genome predictions did not recover one or more of the nox genes expected for the species and these were found with tblastn and exonerate searches of the scaffolds. four new genes were predicted using genewise: duox genes from the species eurytemora affinis  and blatella germanica  and nox <dig> genes from the species phlebotomus papatasi  and heliconius melpomene .

in public domain databases, arthropod genes that seem orthologous to vertebrate nox <dig> have been identified in some species but their function and true evolutionary origin and how pervasive they are in the arthropod phylum have never been studied. for a better look of the distribution of nox4-art genes in arthropod groups we performed tblastn searches against the transcriptome shotgun assembly  sequence database  <cit>  on ncbi website. this enabled us to find nox4-art orthologs in species of arthropods without sequenced genomes. with nox4-art searches against the tsa database,  <dig> sequences belonging to other species of arthropods than those for which we had full genomes were found . of these,  <dig> belonged to hexapoda species, two to chelicerata and five to crustacea. most sequences contained both the ferric reductase and the c-terminal cytoplasmic fad and nadph-binding sites. nevertheless, to make sure the alignments were reliable and enough sites could be used, only sequences longer than  <dig> amino acids were used in the phylogenetic analysis.

in vertebrates, where these enzymes have been well studied, nox genes  <dig> to  <dig> are regulated by a number of other proteins and the binding to the non-glycosylated integral protein p22-phox is essential to their function  <cit> . for that reason, sequences encoding the putative p22-phox accessory protein were also searched in the genomes analyzed using the same approach described for the nox genes. the search for the p22-phox gene in the  <dig> genomes studied yielded  <dig> genes in  <dig> genomes, with only the ascidian, ciona intestinalis, and the cephalochordate, branchiostoma floridae, with two copies . the tblastn and exonerate searches yielded one putative new gene for the species capitella teleta that could only be partially predicted. only for the two annelida species  the polybasic and proline-rich regions  could not be detected. it is important to highlight that orthologs of p22-phox were not found in any arthropod genome.

phylogenetic analysis
our phylogenetic analysis using the protein alignment of the ferric reductase and dehydrogenase  conserved domains of each sequence retrieved from the  <dig> metazoan genomes plus arthropod tsa sequences was able to divide the noxes into four well-supported clades . the duox subfamily  is the most pervasive with almost all species having at least one gene . these same species also lack a nox <dig> gene . this could be due to genome assembly errors or this gene may have been lost in these lineages. other annelida species do have nox <dig> and duox genes  <cit>  and we did find these genes for the species capitella teleta . however, no nox <dig> nor duox genes have ever been found in cnidaria or choanoflagellida  <cit> . in agreement with the literature, we did not find a nox <dig> gene in the urochordate species ciona intestinalis  <cit> . of the five arachnids, only in metaseiulus occidentalis no nox <dig> was found, suggesting an assembly error in this case. as expected, no nox <dig> gene was found in nematodes  <cit> . also, in agreement with kawahara et al.  <dig> nox <dig> was only found in vertebrates and nox <dig> in mammals and reptiles/birds   <cit> . the nox1- <dig> clade also has a high bootstrap value  but the relationships within the clade are not well defined with low bootstrap on most branches . this could be due to saturation and loss of phylogenetic signal at these deep nodes or, less likely, because most substitutions have occurred within the different lineages sampled and not between them. in vertebrates, nox1- <dig> forms a well-supported clade indicating that all three genes have diverged more recently from an ancestral vertebrate nox2-like gene. although zhang et al.  <dig> used the terminology nox1- <dig> for nox <dig> of non-vertebrate metazoans  <cit> , we felt that it was confusing and, for the lack of a better name, we will refer to non-vertebrate nox <dig> as nox2-like. as expected, no nox2-like gene was found in ecdysozoa, pointing to a probable loss in their ancestral lineage. nox <dig> forms a well-supported clade . the divergence between the nox1- <dig> and nox <dig> clades probably happened in the ancestral eumetazoan as indicated by the presence of a nox2-like in the choanoflagelate and porifera species but of nox <dig> only in cnidaria . although it was suggested that the sea urchin does not have a nox <dig> gene  <cit> , we found one that clusters with good support with other metazoan nox <dig>  a well-supported clade  nested within the nox <dig> genes is comprised only of arthropod genes. this clade includes the noxm gene found in mosquitoes  <cit> . with our thorough search of the genomes and tsa database we found that this same gene is present in many other arthropod species. therefore we suggest it to be renamed as nox4-art instead of noxm. the presence and absence of each nox subfamily and p22-phox gene for each animal lineage is summarized in additional file  <dig>  when more than one sequence of nox <dig>  nox <dig> or nox <dig> was found for one particular species these copies seemed to be derived from duplications within the species genome and are therefore paralogs .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogeny of aligned nox proteins identified in our searches, species names and their accession numbers. three well-supported clades have been highlighted in different colors: nox <dig>  nox1- <dig> and nox4/nox4-art. the yellow square within nox <dig> clade depicts the arthropod specific genes . the aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae genes have the same sequence as the ones used in kawahara et al.  <dig>  <cit>  and are highlighted in a different color. numbers on branches are bootstrap support values from  <dig> replicates; only numbers above 50% are shown. scale bar is substitutions per site. the image was created using itol  <cit> 




synteny and protein domain and motif analysis
for the synteny analysis, only species with complete genomes where nox4-art was found were analyzed together in the orthomcl searches. although many species of anopheles have their genomes sequenced, we chose to use only anopheles gambiae since it is the best annotated and studied species. within the species studied, synteny analyses revealed conservation of orthologous genes only among species of the same taxonomic group. within the culicidae , nox4-art genes are flanked by several orthologous groups . within three of the orthologous groups, paralogous genes were found indicating duplications within a species. besides putative duplication events, we also found inversions and changes in gene orientation . taking anopheles gambiae chromosome as reference, the whole syntenic block is inverted in aedes aegypti and, in culex quinquefasciatus, inversions were detected in two pairs of genes, one upstream  and one downstream  of nox4-art. in order to detect if this syntenic region was still present in drosophila melanogaster, a species that lacks nox4/nox4-art, we used the genes found in this region in mosquitoes as queries for online blastp searches against d. melanogaster’s genome in genbank’s nr database. although some orthologs were found in the fruit fly’s genome, they were not found in the same gene cluster and even belonged to different chromosomes . synteny analysis in both lepidopteran scaffolds revealed two and five pairs of orthologous genes up and downstream of nox4-art .

for all noxes, specific structural features have been identified and many key residues and loop sizes were described as important for ros production and structural stability of the enzymes  <cit> . aligning the proteins of the nox4/nox4-art clade separately and using the human nox <dig> as a guide, we identified previously described conserved amino acid residues, loops and segments. figure  <dig> depicts a schematic representation of nox <dig> structural features. as expected, all nox4/nox4-art proteins had the six transmembrane helixes, two fad binding and four nadph binding domains. all four histidine residues that are essential for heme binding and electron transport were present in most proteins. only in those that did not seem complete, probably due to prediction problems, some important residues could not be found . loops a, c, d and the segment between nadph3- <dig> were highly conserved in the number of residues they contain . apart from loop c, loops a and d and the segment between nadph3- <dig> were also conserved in size among all nox1- <dig> proteins, indicating that the size of the loops might be important for protein function  <cit> . in nox4/nox4-art, loop e varies in size among the different taxonomic groups . kawahara et al.  <dig>  identified this segment as being longer in all nox <dig> genes when compared to nox1- <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, in our study, with a higher number of taxa of different taxonomic groups, we can see that in some cases the loop is long but in other cases it is as small as in nox1- <dig> . one differentiating portion of nox4/nox4-art is loop c, that seems to be conserved in size in our analysis  but longer in nox1- <dig>  and nox <dig>   <cit> . in loop e, deletion of the thppgc motif or mutation of the histidine  and cysteine residues  switches hydrogen peroxide to superoxide production in nox <dig>  <cit> . in arthropods, although the motif is different, the histidine and cysteine residues are present in most species . loop b , segment tm6-fad , the vxgpfg-motif  and the extreme c-terminal regions  were identified as being important for nox activity  <cit>  . all species have a polybasic-rich region in loop b, characterized by arginine and lysine residues . in human nox <dig>  these residues are functionally important and bind to the c-terminal region of the dh  domain, providing proximity for the transmembrane heme-binding domain to interact with it  <cit> . although many arginine residues are present in loop b of arthropod’s nox4-art genes, the rrxrr motif characteristic of vertebrates  <cit>  is not present . in segment tm6-fad, most nox sequences have the glycine residue near position  <dig>  in vertebrate nox <dig>  this residue and an arginine near position  <dig> in loop b, also present in most of our sequences , are thought to participate in the binding of p22-phox  <cit> . the expected glutamate  and phenylalanine  residues are present in the c-terminal region of all sequences but the histidine  and a second glutamate  residue are absent in most arthropod sequences . since in the nox4/p22-phox complex these residues are necessary for the constitutive production of ros  <cit> , their absence in nox4-art sequences indicates that these genes are either not constitutively active or that the interaction of loop b and the c-terminal region might be different from that of vertebrate nox <dig>  all sequences have the vxgpfg-motif within nadph <dig> binding site.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of nox4/nox4-art and p22-phox proteins with partial regions of the alignment of important loops and segments. the six hydrophobic helixes of the ferric reductase domain are depicted in pink with the four histidine residues. the dehydrogenase domain is colored in green and yellow . the red asterisk in nadph <dig> shows where the vxgpfg-motif is located. the c-terminal region, important for the interaction with p22-phox, is dark orange. segments and loops are black with loops identified by capital letters. the protein p22-phox with its two transmembrane helixes and proline-rich region  is illustrated in blue. partial alignments of important regions are highlighted in blue for p22-phox  and grey for nox4/nox4-art. within the alignments important residues are colored in red. hs -

silencing of nox4-art
as p22-phox has been shown to be essential for enzymatic activity in the nox <dig> proteins studied so far, the presence of the nox4-art genes in arthropods, together with the lack of p22-phox could be interpreted as indicative of absence of catalytic activity. in order to test for the ros producing activity of nox4-art, we used dsrna-mediated silencing of the nox4-art gene in aedes aegypti embryonic cells . nox4-art silencing resulted in a significant decrease in hydrogen peroxide production , clearly demonstrating that the protein coded by the nox4-art gene is catalytically active, possibly by direct production of hydrogen peroxide, as shown for vertebrate nox <dig> and duox1- <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the silencing of nox4-art by dsrna decreases hydrogen peroxide production in aag- <dig> cells. a qpcr assays were performed with aag- <dig> cells 4 days after transfection with dsrna. error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. *p <  <dig>  . b hydrogen peroxide production by aag- <dig> cells was inferred by amplex red assay. results are pools of  <dig> independent experiments. error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. **p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig>  




discussion
in this study, we evaluated the diversity of noxes in  <dig> arthropod genomes and investigated the origin and function of a nox gene previously found only in the mosquitoes anopheles gambiae and aedes aegypti, here shown to be an ancestral trait of the arthropod lineage. the annotation of the complete nox repertoire in arthropods allowed us to better understand gene divergence and the importance of deletion events in the evolution of this essential gene family. combining the phylogenetic, domain and residue analysis and laboratory work, our data would suggest that: 1) indeed it seems that a nox2-like gene was lost in the ancestral lineage leading to ecdysozoa; 2) as suggested before, nox <dig> and duox are present in all arthropod lineages; 3) nox4-art evolved from a nox4-like ancestor; 4) nox4-art is functional and, although no p22-phox was observed in arthropods, there was no indication of neo-functionalization as this gene still produces hydrogen peroxide; 5) although functional and present in the genomes of many species, nox4-art was lost in a number of arthropod lineages. public domain database’s automatic blast similarity searches have already indicated that a nox4-like gene is present in some arthropod species. nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first work to show that nox4-art is an arthropod specific new gene that originates from a nox4-like ancestor in a phylogenetic framework. we show here the evolutionary origin of this new gene and how pervasive it is in arthropod phylogeny although it has also been lost in many species.

evolution of nox genes
a previous study that analyzed the nox family in a larger context found that this ros generating family is monophyletic and clusters together with other ferric reductase genes. it was proposed that the shift in function from metalloreductase to ros production took place in the ancestral gene of early eukaryotes  <cit> . in agreement with other phylogenetic studies, it was also suggested that since nox2-like is present in choanoflagellates and that sea anemones have both nox2-like and nox <dig>  the split between these two clades happened in the ancestral metazoan. we have not found nox <dig> in the sponge genome, indicating that the nox <dig> gene might have actually emerged later at the time of the cnidarian-bilaterian divergence or may have been lost in this sponge species. these two clades arose from ef-hand containing genes  and the ancestral nox2-like gene later lost these domains  <cit> . this would suggest that both nox <dig> and duox were later lost in choanoflagellates and cnidarians. gene loss seems to be common in the nox family evolution  <cit> . nox <dig>  for example, was also lost in the phylum nematoda  <cit>  and in the mammalian order rodentia  <cit> . our results also corroborate the loss of nox2-like in the ecdysozoa lineage  <cit> . in fact, ecdysozoans seem to have suffered extensive gene losses in many gene families throughout their evolution  <cit> .

gene duplication followed by subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization has been proposed to facilitate the evolution of new gene functions . nevertheless, the evolutionary impact of lineage-specific gene losses has never gained much attention. if no paralogs are present, a gene function that is exclusively associated with a certain gene may disappear if that gene is lost. this outcome has been thought of as detrimental to the species, rendering it less adaptable to the changing environment. however, recently, with new methodological and technological advances , more evidence of the pervasiveness of gene loss has been gathered  <cit> . it is now contemplated that gene loss can be neutral or even adaptive and thus relevant for species evolution . castro et al.  <dig>  for example, have found that gene loss, related to the gastric function gene kit, correlates with the evolution of different stomach types in vertebrates, which might be associated with their diet  <cit> . also, the absence of some urea cycle and essential amino acid synthesis enzymes in the hematophagous rhodnius prolixus was speculated to be due to relaxation of these pathways in an amino acid rich diet  <cit> .

the evidence for gene loss is negative and can pass unnoticed or not be considered due to uncertainties in the completion or assembly of sequenced genomes. therefore, the impact of gene loss in the evolution and function of surviving paralogs is not well investigated. it is easier to recognize gene duplication and the appearance of a new gene function as adaptive. in the evolution of the nox family, gene duplication followed by neofunctionalization seems to have happened very early since both the ability to produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide were present in the ancestral calcium binding enzymes   <cit> . in addition, further evidence of subfunctionalization has recently been gathered in vertebrates. vertebrate nox <dig> seems to be expressed mostly in phagocytes whilst nox <dig>  nox <dig> and nox <dig> have other specific functions and patterns of subcellular localization and tissue distribution  <cit> . still, the major characteristic of this family of enzymes seems to be evolution by gene loss.

gene loss and nox4-art evolution
our more extensive search shows that, as with nox2-like, the nox4/nox4-art gene is present in more animal groups than previously thought  <cit>  but was also lost in many lineages throughout metazoan evolution. this gene seems to have been lost in nematoda and annelida and, of the four molluscan genomes searched, it was found in only one. in these phyla, however, only a small number of genomes were searched and no transcriptomes. in arthropods, where a larger sampling scheme was performed, we show here that nox4-art was lost many times during evolution . although present in chelicerates, crustaceans and hexapods, it was not found in the two myriapoda genomes searched .fig.  <dig> current taxonomic tree of metazoans and choanoflagellida with emphasis on arthropod lineages. phylogenetic relationships between the taxonomic groups adapted from misof et al. and dunn et al.  <cit> . number of nox4/nox4-art genes and the total number of species analyzed here  are represented in the columns. names of taxonomic arthropod orders in grey had no nox4-art. the grey square delimits the phylum arthropoda




in hexapods, sometimes the gene seems to have been lost in the ancestral lineages of whole orders  but this has happened mostly in different species within different taxonomic groups . it is important to differentiate species where only transcriptomes were analyzed from those where complete genome assemblies are present  since the absence from a transcriptome may only mean the gene was not being transcribed at that particular time. nevertheless, even if we take into consideration that the gene could not be found in the genomes of a few species due to assembly errors, we would still see that it is absent from a variety of hexapod species. in diptera, for example, nox4-art is found in mosquitoes but not in the extensively studied genomes of the different drosophila species. this pattern of evolution certainly fits the “patchy ortholog” design that is commonly found in ancient gene families  <cit> .

the pervasiveness of gene loss begs the question of how many genes are actually indispensable in any given genome. in drosophila melanogaster, it has been suggested that around 85% of its genes are dispensable  <cit> . reductive evolution in parasitic or symbiotic species is not a new concept but for other species gene loss has usually been linked to reduction in fitness or has been associated to adaptiveness to specific environments such as the loss of genes related to vision in cave dwelling animals, for example . another possibility is the presence of other genes such as paralogs, analogs or even whole different pathways that serve the same or very similar functions and therefore the loss of a specific gene does not mean loss of function . since nox4-art produces the same byproduct  as duox enzymes, it is plausible that this redundancy might be the reason why it was lost in some lineages. however, this does not explain why in other lineages the gene is present and functional. if duox and nox4-art roles and expression patterns are exactly the same, one questions if a dosage balance problem could not have arisen.

comparative analyses of gene losses according to gene ontology  categories have shown that the differences in dispensability observed between different genes might not be stochastic. gos related to signal transduction, one of the main functions attributed to nox <dig> enzymes  <cit> , and other functions that are more sensitive to dosage imbalance are more prone to be lost  <cit> . other go categories of more ancient biochemical processes such as protein modification and immune response, among others, were also deemed more prone to gene loss in different organisms. all of these are functions in which the production of ros by nox enzymes seems to be involved in. this family of enzymes is certainly a success story that has arisen early in the evolution of multicellular life and thus their participation in ancient biochemical processes and patterns of gene gain and loss are expected  <cit> . however, it is also possible that the loss of a gene function altogether might not have a detrimental or adaptive effect on a species and, in fact, can be neutral  <cit> . neutral or nearly neutral gene losses can be fixed in a species through genetic drift and, in ancient gene families such as noxes, the effect on a phylogenetic framework can be seen as the patchy distribution of orthologs observed  <cit> .

although it would have been desirable to be sure whether incomplete genome coverage and/or assembly or true gene loss was the cause behind the apparent absence of nox4/nox4-art in many species, a synteny analysis to examine the genomic loci was simply not possible for most groups. a strong degree of synteny was only possible to be seen in closely related species probably due to the great divergence among the many species studied . even though hexapods are a more closely related group, the lack of synteny found among the different orders may be due to their ancient radiation  and to the great amount of genome rearrangements that might have occurred. indeed, much faster rates of chromosomal rearrangements have been found for drosophila species when compared to other eukaryotes  <cit> . in addition, for this genus, high rearrangement rates were also found for co-expressed genes within short intergene sequences  <cit> . extensive genome re-arrangements among mosquito  and fly lineages have also been found  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising then that in our study we have not found synteny between the three mosquitoes analyzed and the drosophila melanogaster genome. furthermore, the lepidopteran orthologous groups belong to completely different ones than those of the mosquitoes, indicating that there is no special region on the genome for the nox4-art gene. it seems that it has changed places in the genomes as much as any other old gene and does not seem to belong to any specific expression or otherwise constrained synteny block  <cit> .

nox4-art function and activation
the arthropod nox4-art clade includes the mosquito gene previously described as noxm  <cit> , indicating that this gene is more widely distributed within the phylum and is not related to hematophagy as previously thought. arthropod nox4-art formed a well-supported distinct group closely related to nox <dig> . indeed, our functional analysis indicates that this gene still produces hydrogen peroxide as other nox <dig> genes.

although nox4-art is closely related to nox <dig>  its expression and stability might be different. no p22-phox was found in any arthropod indicating that a different protein or mode of action might be responsible for nox4-art activation. when the expression of p22-phox is inhibited, it greatly diminishes the production of ros by nox <dig>  nevertheless, neither truncated nor mutated forms of p22-phox that disrupted the prr had any effect on ros production on vertebrate nox <dig> genes  <cit> . since this region is the most characteristic of p22-phox in most metazoans, it might be possible that another protein that we could not find with our searches using these proteins as queries could be acting as a nox4-art activator. it has been proposed that nox4/p22-phox complex is structurally different from nox1- <dig> with loop d being the most important feature for the formation of the complex. nox <dig> chimeras with nox <dig> loop d sequences did not translocate to the cell surface nor produced ros  <cit> . nevertheless, a specific motif or residue has not been attributed to the formation of this complex and a better understanding of the interaction of these two proteins is still needed.

motifs and residues in loop b and dh domain are essential for ros production since their interaction approximates the heme, fad and nadph binding sites, facilitating the transfer of electrons. although the characteristic mammalian rrxrr loop b motif is not present in nox4-art, it is also absent in other metazoan nox <dig>  this motif has been determined as important for ros production in mammalian nox <dig> but mostly because of the first arginine residue  <cit> . arginine residues are present in most nox4-art loop b sequences although not in that specific motif. it seems plausible that although different from the vertebrate motif other positively charged motifs might be responsible for the interaction of the dh domain and loop b and, therefore, nox4-art activity. the c-terminal region of nox <dig> is also important for catalytic activity. substitution of the amino acids histidine and glutamate or changes in the size of this region substantially decrease ros production in vertebrates. these changes alter the distance between fad and nadph binding regions and hinder the proper folding of the dh domain  <cit> . the glutamate residue seems to be present in most nox4-art sequences and the number of residues in the c-terminal region does not vary much among arthropod groups being well within the range found for vertebrates . the position of the histidine residue varies in nox4-art; which might not be a problem since in loop b the motifs are different from vertebrates and the relative position of these two regions, that have to interact for proper ros production, may be different for this gene when compared to vertebrate nox <dig>  indeed, although there are many differences in important functional residue positions and motifs between vertebrate nox <dig>  other metazoan nox <dig> and nox4-art, the silencing of aedes aegypti nox4-art shows us that this gene is functional and probably produces hydrogen peroxide as expected for a nox <dig> gene.

when vectorbase  expression maps are searched for anopheles gambiae and aedes aegypti nox4-art genes , we find differential expression during embryonic development  <cit>  and between tissues  <cit>  and increased expression after a blood meal  <cit> . in aedes aegypti, infection with micrococcus luteus or wolbachia  also increases nox4-art expression  <cit> . thus, it seems that nox4-art, in mosquitoes at least, might be linked to a number of physiological functions.

CONCLUSIONS
the increasing number of genomes available can significantly contribute to the study of gene family evolution. the noxes are an intriguing gene family that is responsible for important cellular processes such as cell signaling, transcriptional regulation, stress response and gut homeostasis and defense. genes from this family are present in all eukaryotic groups analyzed until now suggesting that the common ancestor of nox genes emerged at an early stage in the evolution of eukaryotes.

we have found that the noxm  gene described for mosquitoes is actually widespread within arthropods. this gene is potentially functional where it is present and probably produces ros in the form of hydrogen peroxide. important insect specific functions were described for noxes such as cuticular hardening  <cit> , wound healing  <cit> , smooth muscle contraction  <cit>  and gut immunity . nox4-art could have an arthropod specific function as well and therefore be an interesting target for new vector and pest control strategies. in addition, non-mammalian experimental systems are advantageous due to the smaller number of genes present which helps to elucidate questions regarding their expression in different developmental stages and/or tissues.

the arthropod nox4-art gene is also an interesting example of evolution by gene loss. within the phylum arthropoda it has a ‘patchy’ distribution with some species possessing the gene while others do not. it is difficult to determine if the loss of the nox4-art gene in different lineages is due to the presence of another enzyme with similar function  or simply a neutral pattern of evolution. dosage imbalance does not seem to be a problem where nox4-art is present, although subfunctionalization has not been discarded. one thing is certain though; the study of gene loss in gene family evolution should receive more attention, as it could be an important source of information about evolutionary patterns and processes.
