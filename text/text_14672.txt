BACKGROUND

pseudomonas aeruginosa behaves as an opportunist pathogen capable of affecting a wide range of tissues and generating clinical infection episodes which compromise the host’s defence mechanisms  <cit> . infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa represent a major therapeutic challenge in which choice of the right antibiotic is fundamental, however this choice is complicated by the fact that p. aeruginosa presents natural resistance to antibacterial agents to which it is not structurally related, and can even acquire resistance during treatment  <cit> . bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is determined mainly by the production of inactivating enzymes. ampc of p. aeruginosa is a naturally inducible enzyme. wild-type strains may be susceptible to anti-pseudomonas penicillin, inhibitor-penicillin combinations, cephalosporins and carbapenems, however in the presence of a β-lactam inducer, an increase in ampc production may cause resistance to almost all known β-lactams, except carbapenems  <cit> . ampc overproduction may occur through reversible induction of ampc expression during exposure to certain β-lactams  and β-lactamase inhibitors . an important treatment fail occurs when ampc regulation is lost due to de-repression, this condition generally involves genetic mutations in proteins responsible for regulating ampc expression  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa, ampc gene induction is closely connected to peptidoglycan recycling, but regulation of the expression is not yet fully understood  <cit> . recycling of peptidoglycan is a highly regulated system, allowing the bacterial cell wall to be efficiently remodelled during growth and division without its integrity being compromised. it has been proposed that p. aeruginosa is capable of “sensing” the disturbance of its cell wall, inducing expression of β-lactamase ampc and recovering homeostasis of the murein by hydrolysis of the antibiotic .

penicillin-binding proteins  are acyl-serin transferases, initially identified by their ability to form covalent bonds with penicillin  <cit> . they are located on the external face of the inner membrane and share common d,d-peptidase activities , catalysed by a domain which binds β-lactams . the active site of these proteins contains well preserved residues with principal sequence s*xxk containing catalytic serin and the sxn and ktg triads, which together allow acetylation and deacetylation processes  <cit> . pbps can be classified into two main categories as a function of their amino acid sequence and relative mobility in sds-page gels: high molecular mass pbps  and low molecular mass pbps . hmm-pbps are responsible for the polymerisation of peptidoglycan and its incorporation into the pre-existing cell wall, while lmm-pbps are involved in peptidoglycan cell separation, maturation and recycling, acting as catalyst for d,d-carboxypeptidase or d,d-endopeptidase activities  <cit> . five hmm-pbps are recognised for the pseudomonas aeruginosa model: pbp1a, pbp1b, pbp <dig>  pbp <dig> and pbp3a; and three lmm-pbps: pbp <dig>  pbp <dig> and pbp <dig>  which are homologous with pbp1a, 1b,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of e. coli. only the coding genes for pbp1a,  <dig>   <dig>  3a  and  <dig> have been cloned and characterised  <cit> ; the crystallographic structure has been resolved for hmm-pbp <dig>  <cit>  and lmm-pbp <dig>  <cit> .

modification of any protein involved in the ampc induction mechanism may lead to de-repression of the expression of this gene. although research into members of the enterobacteriaceae family has identified mutations in ampr, the majority of the changes observed in clinical isolations of p. aeruginosa have been associated with the ampd gene [7

,
18
]. the ampd protein has been characterised as a negative ampc regulator, however mutations in the coding gene compromise normal processing of anhydromuropeptides, producing a permanent increase in the concentration of cytoplasm effectors which favours binding with ampr and raises the constitutive expression of ampc  <cit> . a further complexity for p. aeruginosa is that some strains which overproduce ampc do not present mutations in ampr and ampd genes, or in the ampr-ampc inter-gene region, and do not show changes in the expression level of ampd, indicating the existence of additional factors contributing to ampc regulation in this model. spontaneous inactivation of lmm-pbp <dig>  encoded by the dacb gene, has been recognised as a clinically relevant cause of resistance to anti-pseudomonas β-lactam antibiotics through hyperproduction of ampc, with levels exceeding those produced by ampd mutants. inactivation of this lmm-pbp provokes a highly efficient and complex response in terms of β-lactam resistance, triggering overproduction of chromosomal ampc β-lactamase and specific activation of the two-components regulatory system crebc , which plays a role in resistance through an still unknown mechanism [2
7
,
21–23]. the connection between the peptidoglycan turnover and recycling processes, and the regulatory pathways for constitutive hyperproduction of chromosomal ampc β-lactamase, particularly the mechanism related with lmm-pbp <dig> inactivation, raised the need for the present work, whose aim is to define the in vivo functionality of this lmm-pbp of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

in vivo pbp <dig> d,d-peptidase activities on macromolecular peptidoglycan of escherichia coli

in vivo studies of d,d-peptidase activities  for lmm-pbp <dig> on macromolecular peptidoglycan of escherichia coli was carried out using bacterial cultures of recombinant constructs pet-pbp4hnc, pet-pbp4hn, pet-pbp4hc, transformed into a lysogenized mutant strain e. coli dv <dig>  cultured with and without iptg induction. these samples were used in the preparation and separation of peptidoglycan, according to the protocols mentioned above. the relative amount of monomer m <dig> and dimer d <dig> in the murein sacculus of the mutant strain e. coli dv <dig> allowed us to investigate in vivo the d,d-carboxypeptidase function  and the d,d-endopeptidase-d,d-carboxypeptidase function  for lmm-pbp <dig>  their activity was estimated from the variation in the abundance of the substrate and product muropeptides relative to a control sample in the hplc analyses of digested sacculi. the results correspond to the mean value of three individual experiments.

in vivo pbp <dig> d,d-peptidase activities on macromolecular peptidoglycan of pseudomonas aeruginosa
for in vivo studies of d,d-peptidase activities  of lmm-pbp <dig> on macromolecular peptidoglycan of pseudomonas aeruginosa were used murein preparations of the wild-type reference strain pa14wt under natural conditions and after antibiotic treatment. transformant strain pa14wt/pherd-pbp <dig> was used without induction, under overexpression conditions  and after antibiotic inactivation for lmm-pbp <dig>  lmm-pbp <dig> inactivation was carried by treatment of the culture with cefoxitin  at 37 °c for 42 min . enzyme activities were estimated from the variation in the abundance of presumed substrate and product muropeptides relative to a control sample in the hplc analyses. the results correspond to the mean value of three independent experiments.

d,d-peptidase activity on natural substrates. kinetic studies
the d,d-carboxypeptidase activity for lmm-pbp <dig> of pao <dig> was assayed in vitro by monitoring the appearance of the monomeric tetrapeptide  in mixtures containing increasing concentrations of monomer disaccharide pentapeptide   as substrate, purified enzyme pbp4hc  and pbs 1x ph  <dig> , in a final volume of 200 μl. reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °c for 150 min. d,d-endopeptidase activity was determined using increasing concentrations of the dimeric compound tetrapentapeptide  , pbp4hc protein  and pbs 1x ph  <dig> . reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °c for 110 min. all enzyme reactions were terminated by boiling the samples for 2 min; they were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 10 min, filtered  and analysed by hplc. apparent k

three-dimensional structure
a 3d model of pbp <dig> from pseudomonas aeruginosa was generated using homology modelling procedures and the crystal structure of pbp4a from bacillus subtilis as template   <cit> . model coordinates were built using the swiss-model server  and their structural quality was checked using the analysis programmes provided by the same server . global model quality estimation scores are qmean <dig> raw score:  <dig>  and qmean <dig> z-score: − <dig> ; these are within the accepted range for homology-based structure models. to optimize geometries, the model was energy-minimized using the gromos96_43b <dig> force field implemented in deepview v <dig>  , using  <dig> steps of steepest descent minimization followed by  <dig> steps of conjugate-gradient minimization. to evaluate the enzyme-substrate interaction we used the molecular structure of a fragment of synthetic pentapeptide ligand  extracted from the pdb 3itb archive  <cit> ; this was modified by combined use of the corina v <dig> , autodock  <dig>   <cit>  and pymol v <dig>  programmes, followed by manual edition of the atom coordinates to refine the interaction.

RESULTS
the cloned molecular forms of lmm-pbp <dig> from pao <dig> are functional as penicillin-binding proteins
the constructs for lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig> , enabled us to evaluate the yield and behaviour of the whole recombinant product, maintaining the sequence which defines its signal peptide, avoiding alterations to the structural nature of this protein and allowing it to be recovered in functional and constitutive conditions very close to those of its native organisation. after induction, overexpression and subsequent purification assays, sds-page and western blot analyses confirmed that only one protein migrated to a position close to 51 kda, matching the molecular masses expected and calculated for the constructs pet-pbp4hnc , pet-pbp4hn  and pet-pbp4hc  . although the final products for the recombinant proteins developed are identical, the forms adopted during synthesis vary and an unprocessed variant can be recognised with a higher molecular mass than the mature form  in recombinant proteins pbp4hnc and pbp4hn. in both cases the induced material presents two bands , while for pbp4hc only one band is identified, which corresponds to the mature form of the recombinant protein . the recombinant product recovered from the purification assays is the mature form of the protein for the clone pet-pbp4hc, and the unprocessed and processed forms for the clones pet-pbp4hnc and pet-pbp4hn. this allows us to evaluate the presence of the his · tag bound to the amino terminal and the difficulty which this configuration causes in protein maturation. both the precursor and the mature forms present the ability to bind to bocillin™ fl.fig.  <dig>

in vivo d,d-peptidase activity of lmm-pbp <dig> on macromolecular peptidoglycan of escherichia coli
d,d-peptidase activities were evaluated in vivo on macromolecular peptidoglycan derived from a mutant of e. coli  lacking d,d-carboxypeptidase and d,d-endopeptidase activities and modified by lysogenization, as shown in fig.  <dig>  the chromatograms obtained for transformant lysogens not induced and induced by iptg confirm significant decrease of the substrates m <dig> and d <dig>  in each transformant strain subjected to induction, in comparison with the absence of changes in the muropeptides profile for non-induced material. the muropeptides which determine a d,d-endopeptidase function are the monomers m <dig> and m <dig>  generated from substrate d <dig>  in this case there is a clear reduction of the substrate and an increase in the amount of m <dig> in particular. this effect is determined by the use of m <dig> as an alternative substrate for the second activity of the enzyme, d,d-carboxypeptidase. d,d-carboxypeptidase activity expressed with substrates d <dig> and m <dig> favours production of d <dig> and m <dig> respectively; this fact amplifies the final amount of m <dig> monomeric product both directly and indirectly through the occurrence of new d,d-endopeptidase activity on the newly generated dimeric product-substrate d <dig> fig.  <dig> d,d-peptidase activities on peptidoglycan of escherichia coli. hplc chromatograms of peptidoglycan obtained from strains e. coli dv900/pet-pbp4hnc, e. coli dv900/pet-pbp4hn and e. coli dv900/pet-pbp4hc, uninduced  and induced by iptg . chromatograms for the lysogenized mutant strain e. coli dv <dig> and transformed with the expression vector pet-28b are presented as controls. the following muropeptides are identified: m <dig>  monomer disaccharide tripeptide; m <dig>  monomer disaccharide tetrapeptide; m <dig>  monomer disaccharide pentapeptide; m4n, anhydrous monomer disaccharide tetrapeptide; d <dig>  dimer disaccharide tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide; d <dig>  dimer disaccharide tetrapeptide-pentapeptide; d45n, anhydrous dimer disaccharide tetrapeptide-pentapeptide; t <dig>  trimer tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide-pentapeptide; t445n, anhydrous trimer tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide-pentapeptide. a <dig>  absorbance at 204 nm, arbitrary units




in vivo d,d-peptidase activity of lmm-pbp <dig> on macromolecular peptidoglycan of pseudomonas aeruginosa
the peptidoglycan structure for the bacterial model pseudomonas aeruginosa ucbpp-pa <dig> was evaluated under three conditions, native, lmm-pbp <dig> overexpression and antibiotic inactivation, as a function of the relative amount of global muropeptides , unitary components  and related structural parameters  described in additional file 2: table s <dig> . under conditions of non-expression of the dacb gene and absence of β-lactam  antibiotic treatment, the peptidoglycan composition for the transformant strain pa14wt/pherd-pbp <dig> as compared to the murein composition of the reference strain ucbpp-pa <dig>  presents a fall in the levels of dimers, trimers, dap-dap and d-d/total; these define an increase in the amount of monomers and a lower percentage of crosslinking. there was also a reduction in anhydrous forms which explains a moderate increase in the chain lengths. these effects may be interpreted as a consequence of a basal level of expression of the dacb gene in this construction. the peptidoglycan of the transformant strain pa14wt/pherd-pbp <dig> under induction  presents an organisation which reveals a significant decrease in the amount of dimeric and trimeric constituents , leading to a proportional increase in the relative abundance of monomers  and a considerable decrease in the crosslinking levels ; the reduction in the number of anhydrous forms is also considerable , which in turn defines greater chain length , in the muropeptides composition for the murein of the corresponding non-induced control strain. dap-dap and lipoprotein levels do not present major changes, the percentages of d-d/total are slightly higher, while the values assigned to monomer disaccharide pentapeptide present only a slight reduction . under antibiotic treatment with cefoxitin , the structural composition of pa14wt peptidoglycan presented an important increase in the relative quantity of monomer disaccharide pentapeptide   which stimulates the formation of dimers and trimers with 4– <dig> bonds  , and as a consequence of this increase there is a reduction in monomers  and an increase in the crosslinking percentage . the consequence of this efficient blocking of all the lmm-pbps by the β-lactam cefoxitin, interrupting d,d-carboxypeptidase and d,d-endopeptidase functions, is favourable to the results described. in the case of lmm-pbp <dig> induction  and treatment with cefoxitin, the peptidoglycan architecture of the pa14wt/pherd-pbp <dig> strain presents structural parameters very close to those reported in the wild-type ; this confirms that there is a reversion, as there is again a rise in the level of monomers and a reduction in crosslinking, defined by the expression of d,d-endopeptidase activity. the recovery in the pentapeptide  value is not very efficient, since lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be better for d,d-endopeptidase than d,d-carboxypeptidase .fig.  <dig> d,d-peptidase activities on peptidoglycan of pseudomonas aeruginosa. hplc chromatograms of peptidoglycan obtained from reference strain ucbpp-pa <dig> , pa14wt/pherd-pbp <dig> induced with l-arabinose  <dig>  %, pa14wt treated with cefoxitin , and pa14wt/pherd-pbp <dig> induced with l-arabinose  <dig>  % and treated with cefoxitin . the following muropeptides are identified: m <dig>  monomer disaccharide tripeptide; m <dig>  monomer disaccharide tetrapeptide; m <dig>  monomer disaccharide pentapeptide; m3l, monomer disaccharide tripeptide associated with lipoprotein; d <dig>  dimer disaccharide tetrapeptide-tripeptide; d <dig>  dimer disaccharide tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide; d44n, anhydrous dimer disaccharide tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide; t <dig>  trimer tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide; t444n, anhydrous trimer tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide-tetrapeptide. arab., arabinose; a <dig>  absorbance at 204 nm, arbitrary units




d,d-peptidase activity of lmm-pbp <dig> on natural muropeptides. kinetic evaluation
the enzyme digestion assay for pbp4hc on the purified and concentrated muropeptides m <dig>  and d <dig> , and the evaluation carried out with hplc, confirm the capability of this enzyme to develop d,d-carboxypeptidase activity, since it can remove a d-alanine terminal from the peptide chain for the substrate m <dig> and generate an increase in the product m <dig> . the protein studied for its effects on dimer disaccharide d <dig> demonstrates its competence as an efficient d,d-endopeptidase, hydrolysing the peptide bond which maintains the dimer configuration of this substrate and recovering the expected monomer products, m <dig> and m <dig> respectively. the amount of monomer disaccharide tetrapeptide was slightly higher than the amount of monomer disaccharide pentapeptide recovered, which demonstrates secondary d,d-carboxypeptidase activity from the m <dig> generated; the same function is demonstrated by the production of d <dig>  from the original substrate d <dig>  enzyme activity on anhydrous derivates m5n  and d45n  shows very similar behaviour to that of muropeptide substrates with no chain terminus residues, although with a minority product profile. this helps to explain the d,d-carboxypeptidase and d,d-endopeptidase properties of lmm-pbp <dig> , despite this, d,d-carboxypeptidase activity can be identified on substrate m <dig> from the presence of product m4n, as well as d,d-endopeptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase bifunctionality on the dimer substrate d45n, from the recovery of muropéptidos m <dig>  m4n and m5n  and monomer m <dig>  . analysis of d,d-carboxypeptidase/d,d-endopeptidase activity for lmm-pbp <dig> on purified muropeptides m <dig> and d <dig> yielded kinetic constants v

3d structural homology analysis of lmm-pbp <dig> revalidates d,d-endopeptidase activity
homology simulation for the protein lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa o <dig>  enables us to distinguish clearly the three motives which define it as lmm-pbp class c, subclass c <dig>  located in domain  <dig>  as in the case of its structural homologues, pbp4a of bacillus subtilis and d,d-peptidase of actinomadura r <dig>  and its functional homologue pbp <dig> of escherichia coli, for the monomer unit of lmm-pbp <dig> in pao <dig> we confirmed the presence of an amino acid insert which constitutes domains ii and iii . the active site of the protein is located in domain i , at the interface between  <dig> β sheets and a group of α helices. it consists of the initial segment of helix α <dig>  which is part of the stmk sequence , the lateral chain of a β <dig> sheet  which contains the ktg conserved motive, and a small loop which connects helices α3-α <dig>  and incorporates a third snn conserved sequence . residues from domains ii and iii take part of the roof of a cavity which communicates at depth with the inner catalytic serine. the estimated dimensions of this u-shaped slit on the surface of the protein  are very close to those described for the slit of the active site on the functional homologue pbp <dig> of e. coli    <cit> . molecular simulation of the coupling of the mimetic pentapeptide substrate amv-l-ala-fga-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala in the cavity of the active site for lmm-pbp <dig> of pao <dig> validates its size and tolerance of larger ligands; it also allows us to identify the constituent amino acids of a sub-site in the catalytic pocket  . they are related  with the specificity for its substrate, by recognition of the terminal group nh3
+-ch-coo− for the amino acid mesoa2pm of the peptide chain. actually, in the molecular model, the l-lys of the mimetic pentapeptide substrate is linked to the protein by specific interaction with three of those residues: the carbon chain of l-lys interact with leucine  <dig> , and the nh3

in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the inactivation of ampd and point mutations in ampr and dacb  have been found to lead to ampc overexpression; the shared aspect of each of these three proteins is the functional requirement for concomitant maturation of its peptidoglycan. these two processes  are directly interconnected by the pathway for the efficient recycling of muropeptides . ampd and dacb are not required for overexpression. a functional ampr is required, but on the contrary, it is the mutational inactivation of ampd or dacb what produces the overexpression. recent studies stressed the complexity of this relationship, in which the role of the amidase ampd is definitely known, the role of the transcriptional regulator ampr is partially recognised with some degree of certainty, while researchers have speculated on the function of lmm-pbp <dig> based on information available for coding gene of this protein in the pao <dig> and ucbpp-pa <dig> strains. the putative nature of this information has been partly resolved in recent research showing, for example, that lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa exercises control over the function of ampr, presumably as a result of its ability to create or destroy a particular muropeptide chain subunit  <cit> . a study aimed to characterize the role of lmm-pbps in peptidoglycan composition, β-lactam resistance, and ampc regulation, indicated that pbp <dig> play a significant role as d,d-carboxipeptidase only when pbp <dig> is absent; on the other hand, the peptidoglycan structure of pbp <dig> and pbp <dig> single and double mutants showed that these proteins have d,d-endopeptidase activity  <cit> . a recent publication explored the catalytic capability of this enzyme through direct digestion assays on peptidoglycan sacculus and a variety of synthetic substrates, finding that lmm-pbp <dig>  exerts d,d-carboxypeptidase and d,d-endopeptidase activity, just like its functional homologue pbp <dig> of escherichia coli   <cit> . in an attempt to confirm the above with a dynamic experimental model in vivo using natural substrates, we investigated the function for lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa initially using digestion assay on macromolecular peptidoglycan derived from e. coli dv <dig>  a lysogenized mutant strain  with deletions in coding gene for all class c lmm-pbps, as well as ampc. this provided a biological system with structural organisation of the cell wall which was particularly favourable for studying d,d-carboxypeptidase and d,d-endopeptidase activities. variations in the relative abundance of muropeptides enabled us to identify a significant diminution of the substrates m <dig> and d <dig>  in each transformant strain subjected to induction, in comparison with the absence of changes in the muropeptides profile for non-induced material. starting with substrate d <dig>  the increase in the monomeric products m <dig> and particularly m <dig>  define a d,d-endopeptidase function for lmm-pbp <dig>  this does not appear to be affected by the presence of a d-alanine residue in position  <dig> for an acceptor peptide chain in dimeric muropeptides. the presence of the minority product d <dig>  and m <dig> confirms d,d-carboxypeptidase activities on substrates d <dig> and m <dig> respectively. the lower relative abundance of d <dig>  compared to the levels of m <dig> and m <dig> recovered from substrate d <dig>  eliminates the possibility that lmm-pbp <dig> of pao <dig> carries out an initial d,d-carboxypeptidase activity. a smaller reduction in d45n , t <dig>  and t445n  represents an important extension of substrate specificity in both activities . it has been suggested that the presence of  <dig> -anhydromurnac residue might have a significant implication for d,d-carboxypeptidase/d,d-endopeptidase eactions, given the smaller reduction in anhydrous d45n-t445n substrates under muropeptides d45-t <dig>  this hypothesis would appear to be incorrect, in view of the presence of a smaller but detectable amount of product m4n  in each muropeptides profile generated from induced material. the above shows the simultaneous bifunctionality of d,d-endopeptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase exerted in vivo on macromolecular peptidoglycan for each of the recombinant proteins for lmm-pbp <dig> of pao <dig>  expressed in the strain of escherichia coli tested. cloning of the coding gene for lmm-pbp <dig> of pao <dig> in expression vectors compatible with pseudomonas aeruginosa enabled us to design an experiment to investigate the modulating role of this lmm-pbp in the molecular integrity of the cell wall for this bacterial model. the organisation of the peptidoglycan for the wild-type strain ucbpp-pa <dig>  containing the recombinant construct for lmm-pbp <dig> , under induction shows a reduction in the amount of dimeric and trimeric constituents, leading to a proportional increase in the quantity of monomers and an important reduction in crosslinking, as well as a fall in the number of anhydrous forms and a smaller reduction in the levels of m <dig> . these results are consistent with the occurrence of a main d,d-endopeptidase activity and a secondary d,d-carboxypeptidase activity, produced by the overexpression of lmm-pbp <dig> in this bacterial system; the same was demonstrated in a previous study, in which the effect of lmm-pbp <dig> overproduction on the murein synthesized in vivo for the model escherichia coli presented results with a similar tendency, with low level of crosslinking in -d-ala-dap peptide bridges, an increase in the quantity of monomers and a reduction in the number of dimers, trimers and tetramers. this composition reflects the exclusive d,d-endopeptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase functions exercised by lmm-pbp <dig> of e. coli and involved in the turnover of the peptide crosslinking of their peptidoglycan  <cit> . a third group of studies, intended to evaluate direct d,d-peptidase activity for the purified pbp4hc on natural muropeptides m <dig>  d <dig>  m5n and d45n, confirm that lmm-pbp <dig>  is capable of exert d,d-endopeptidase/d,d-carboxypeptidase catalytic functions. jointly with these digestion assays, and as a way of establishing a definite conclusion on the predominant enzyme activity for lmm-pbp <dig>  we investigated the individual behaviour of each activity by estimating the kinetic parameters v

m of lmm-pbp <dig>  for d <dig> reflects the greater affinity between this protein and its dimeric substrate, and a minor presence of the elution product d <dig>  exclude the initial occurrence of d,d-carboxypeptidase activity. these data, together with the much higher catalytic effectiveness values  found for lmm-pbp <dig> activity on dimeric substrate d <dig> than the k
cat values for this protein on natural substrate m <dig>  confirm that d,d-endopeptidase activity is predominant for lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa o <dig>  finally, analysis of the structural model for the monomeric unit of lmm-pbp <dig> in pao <dig> evidence a trimodular organisation of this enzyme , with a russian doll  integration model for each module  and a very similar orientation to that described for structural homologues pbp4a of bacillus subtilis, d,d-peptidase of actinomadura r <dig> and the functional homologue pbp <dig> of escherichia coli  <cit> . on the back face of domain ii, opposite the contact surface with domain i , three residues of lysine and four of arginine expose a positively charged area and form a bonding mechanism to the internal membrane which is an alternative to the electrostatic and polarity interactions defined for the carboxyl terminal in this protein. a similar surface has been described for domain ii of pbp4a of b. subtilis and d,d-peptidase of actinomadura r <dig>  however the presence of residues of this kind has not been recognised for lmm-pbp <dig> in the escherichia coli bacterial system  <cit> . domain iii with a less rigid architecture, presents a segment which forms an integral part of the active site on this protein. comparison with related enzymes shows that domain i for lmm-pbp <dig> of pao <dig> contains the necessary groups to activate catalytic serine s <dig>  and to carry out a nucleophile attack on the substrate. the residues involved in the acetylation and deacetylation mechanisms by pbps have not been clearly identified, however in our case, for the first process, a lysine in position  <dig>  is probably the priority structural amino acid. the constituent residues of domains ii and iii determine a cavity which communicates with the catalytic serine of the active centre, with estimated width, depth and height which would favour access of small molecules  and longer substrates, as described in other members of this sub-class of proteins. our three-dimensional model highlights the orientation and ordering of the residues of domain iii at the entrance of the slit to the active site, which appears to support the idea of the function of this domain in steric control of access by the substrate, a competence which has not been confirmed but has been deduced for the homologue protein pbp <dig> of e. coli  <cit> . the positional equivalence demonstrated between residues in the active site of lmm-pbp <dig> in pao <dig>  particularly aspartic acid in position  <dig>  and asparagine in position  <dig> , with amino acids conserved and defined as constituents of a specific sub-site in the catalytic pocket of homologue proteins pbp <dig> of e. coli , pbp4a of b. subtilis  and d,d-peptidase in actinomadura r <dig> , involved in the specificity by their substrate, through recognition of a residue in position  <dig>  of the peptide chain, may constitute a distinguishing precedent, in terms of substrate requirement, between bifunctional proteins with d,d-carboxypeptidase/d,d-endopeptidase activities and monofunctional proteins with d,d-carboxypeptidase or d,d-transpeptidase activities  <cit> . it should be noted that for the structural model of pbp4a in b. subtilis, a threonine in position  <dig>  constitutes an amino acid residue with the capability of establishing a hydrogen bridge with t <dig> , contributing to the network of bonds which strengthen the active site. this bonding structure has been recognised in an equivalent position in other representatives of lmm-pbps, class c, subclass c <dig>  however, in pbp <dig>  pbp <dig> and pbp6b of e. coli , an arginine residue occupies this position, acting as a steric impediment to the positioning of a larger substrate than the methyl group of the last d-alanine in the peptide chain   <cit> . in our simulation for lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa, a threonine amino acid  in a position which coincides with the location of t <dig> in bacillus subtilis, together with the structural data given above, could represent constitutive information highlighting the occurrence of the d,d-endopeptidase function.

CONCLUSIONS
this study confirms in vivo the d,d-carboxypeptidase/d,d-endopeptidase bifunctionality of lmm-pbp <dig> of pseudomonas aeruginosa on macromolecular peptidoglycan in two models, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. it highlights the occurrence of d,d-endopeptidase activity as the principal activity on these substrates. kinetic assays on natural muropeptides allowed us to confirm both these hydrolytic capabilities and to define catalytic d,d-endopeptidase activity as predominant. this competence is supported structurally by the composition and dimensions of the active site, obtained by molecular modelling of this protein. this description of the function and conformation of lmm-pbp <dig> constitutes a new perspective which supports the proposal of this protein as a potential hydrolase-autolysin associated with peptidoglycan maturation and recycling, the fact that mutant pbp <dig> induces ampc, may indicate that a putative muropeptide subunit product of the dd-epase activity of pbp <dig> could be a negative regulator of the pathway, and this makes a significant contribution to further understand the regulatory pathways for the induction and constitutive hyperproduction of chromosomal ampc β-lactamase on pseudomonas aeruginosa.
