BACKGROUND
iron is an important nutrient for bacteria, serving as a co-factor for proteins involved in respiration, the tricarboxylic acid  cycle, enzyme catalysis, gene regulation, photosynthesis, n <dig> fixation, methanogenesis, h <dig> production and consumption, oxygen transport, and dna biosynthesis  <cit> . iron exists in two redox states under physiological conditions: the insoluble fe ferric form and the relatively soluble fe ferrous form, which renders it a useful enzyme prosthetic group  <cit> . however, iron can induce oxidative stress by catalyzing fenton reactions, and the prevalent fe form has low bioavailability  <cit> . intracellular levels of iron must, therefore, be carefully controlled to meet the metabolic needs of the cell while limiting cellular damage due to iron overload  <cit> .

microbial iron response has been well-studied in escherichia coli, which adapts to low iron conditions by inducing iron-binding transporters embedded in the outer and inner membranes to import iron  <cit> . iron-chelating siderophores also are secreted to solubilize iron prior to transportation across the membranes  <cit> . concurrently, production of non-essential proteins that use iron is inhibited, which increases the pool of free iron in the cell  <cit> . iron homeostasis in a diverse group of prokaryotes is maintained by the global transcriptional factor fur  and small regulatory rna ryhb. fur is an iron-responsive protein dimer with an amino-terminal helix-turn-helix dna binding domain and a metal-binding domain  <cit> . each fur monomer complexes with fe and binds the major groove of iron responsive gene promoters at a conserved 19-bp inverted repeat sequence  called the "fur box". the fur box, located near the cognate promoter  <cit> , effectively prevents recruitment of rna polymerase holoenzyme to the promoter and thus represses transcription  <cit> . fur directly represses the expression of ryhb small rna, which in turn represses a large group of mrnas encoding non-essential, iron-using proteins  <cit> . this regulatory cascade of fur and ryhb is believed to ensure that iron is directed towards essential iron-using proteins during iron limitation  <cit> .

studying iron homeostasis in s. oneidensis is of interest for a number of reasons. known terminal electron acceptors of s. oneidensis include a variety of inorganic and organic compounds such as fumarate, nitrate, thiosulfate, trimethylamine n-oxide , fe, mn, cr, and u  <cit> . the ability of s. oneidensis to respire fe is unique among the known γ-proteobacteria. iron not only acts as a cofactor in s. oneidensis, but also as an important terminal electron acceptor. s. oneidensis is also striking for its high cellular demand for iron due to a high cellular content of heme  <cit> , which is a protein cofactor requiring iron. the characteristic pink or red color of the cells indicates the high content of heme in s. oneidensis. in addition, s. oneidensis has been shown to be a fish pathogen as well as an opportunistic human pathogen  <cit> . iron-regulated metabolisms are essential for the virulence of vibrio cholerae  <cit> , bacillus cereus  <cit> , neisseria meningitidis  <cit>  and shigella species  <cit> . it is possible that iron may play a similar role in s. oneidensis as it does in other pathogenic γ-proteobacteria .

an ortholog of fur has been identified in s. oneidensis  <cit> . its major role is to act as a repressor that mediates transcription of genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis and iron acquisition systems  <cit>  and hence plays a role in response to iron depletion. it remains unclear, however, which other biological pathways respond to the change of iron concentration, as well as the nature of those responses. to identify iron-responsive processes, we carried out an integrative study with physiological, transcriptomic and genetic approaches.

RESULTS
physiological response of mr- <dig> to changes in iron concentration
to examine the iron response of s. oneidensis, the wild-type strain mr- <dig> was grown in lb medium with different concentrations of the iron chelator  <dig> '-dipyridyl used to deplete iron. lb medium, a rich source of iron   <cit> , was used to provide sufficient biomass for the following microarray experiments. iron depletion imposed a challenge to cell proliferation and survival, resulting in an extended lag phase, slower growth rate at mid-log phase, and lower cell density at stationary phase . while  <dig> μm  <dig> '-dipyridyl had a marginal effect on the growth rate of mr- <dig>  the cells displayed clear growth inhibition with  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm  <dig> '-dipyridyl. when  <dig> μm  <dig> '-dipyridyl was used, cell growth was completely arrested throughout five days of observation.

to test whether iron depletion led to a rapid physiological change, mr- <dig> was grown to mid-log phase , then  <dig> '-dipyridyl was added to a final concentration of  <dig> μm, followed by addition of ferrous sulfate after one hour. iron depletion rapidly slowed growth within an hour of adding  <dig> '-dipyridyl. growth was recovered by the subsequent addition of ferrous sulfate .

transcriptomics and gene co-expression network
for microarray experiments, mr- <dig> cultures at mid-log phase were treated with  <dig> '-dipyridyl. after one hour, iron was repleted with the addition of ferrous sulfate to the medium.  <dig> μm  <dig> '-dipyridyl was used for iron depletion for the microarray experiments because it inhibited, but did not abrogate, cell growth . samples were collected at multiple time points during iron depletion and repletion and were used for global transcriptomic analyses. the reliability of the microarray data was validated by quantitative rt-pcr of selected genes . a high correlation coefficient of  <dig>  was observed between rt-pcr and the microarray results.

avalues greater than  <dig> indicate up-regulation and values less than  <dig> indicate down-regulation. a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  was calculated after converting the rt-pcr and microarray data in the table to their logarithmic values. --: not detected.

the number of genes showing significant differential gene expression at each time point is listed in table  <dig>  the identification of  <dig> genes induced within one minute of iron depletion, many of which encode iron acquisition systems, clearly indicates that iron response is a very rapid process in s. oneidensis. also notable is the fact that the total numbers of differentially expressed genes are smaller at earlier time points of iron depletion and repletion than those at later time points, at which other effects  may impact gene expression profiles. as is common in microarray datasets, a large portion of the up- or down-regulated genes corresponds to genes with unknown function, indicating a much broader iron stimulon and regulon than have been deduced solely on the basis of gene annotation. when the genes with significant changes were classified according to their functional categories, several groups were predominantly represented: transport and binding proteins , regulatory functions, energy metabolism, adaptation to atypical conditions, and biosynthesis of cofactors or proteins, as exemplified at  <dig> minutes of iron depletion and repletion .

to gain more insights into the iron-responsive genes, a gene co-expression network containing a total of  <dig> genes partitioned into twelve modules  was constructed . further analyses indicated that each module contains a functionally coherent set of genes. large modules of genes related to iron acquisition, anaerobic energy metabolism and protein degradation are the most predominant in the network, suggesting that they are the major iron-responsive biological pathways in s. oneidensis. in addition, gene modules of dna metabolism, sulfur metabolism, protein synthesis and aerobic energy metabolism also were identified.

module of iron acquisition systems
the large module shown in fig. 3a is composed almost exclusively of iron acquisition systems, suggesting that these genes are highly co-regulated under iron depletion and repletion conditions. these genes include the tonb system , the hemin abc transporter , the siderophore synthetic protein , and an iron-regulated outer membrane protein . a majority of genes were strongly induced by iron depletion and repressed by iron repletion . notably, two homologous tonb systems located at the inner membrane have been annotated in s. oneidensis. the tonb1-exbb1-exbd <dig> operon was induced  <dig> – <dig>  fold during iron depletion and then repressed up to  <dig> fold by iron repletion, while tonb2-exbb2-exbd <dig> was not regulated by iron. consistently, a "fur box" was identified upstream of the tonb1-exbb1-exbd <dig> operon, but not upstream of the tonb2-exbb2-exbd <dig> operon  <cit> . in contrast, three genes  display expression patterns opposite to the iron acquisition systems . the presence of bfr <dig> can be explained as a bacterioferritin subunit that is regulated in the opposite way to iron acquisition.

expression ratio values greater than  <dig> denote increases in gene expression and values between  <dig> and  <dig> indicate decreases in gene expression. --: not detected.

five genes  encoding unknown conserved inner or outer membrane proteins are regulated by iron, raising the possibility of novel iron acquisition systems. in addition, a single transcriptional regulator  clusters with iron acquisition systems. very recently, an independent genetic study showed that so <dig> regulated siderophore production, confirming its role in regulating iron acquisition  <cit> .

to identify the possible transcriptional regulator for genes in this module, their upstream intergenic regions were searched for common motifs using the gibbs recursive sampler  <cit> . a motif almost identical to the predicted "fur box" in s. oneidensis  <cit>  was identified . thus, the genes in this module appeared to be directly controlled by fur. consistently, most of these genes were de-repressed in a fur deletion mutant  <cit> .

module of anaerobic energy metabolism
in general, genes in this module are repressed by iron depletion and induced by repletion . this module contains many genes contributing to anaerobic energy metabolism, including c-type cytochromes, which function in anaerobic metal reduction ; anaerobic ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase ; the fad-binding subunit of the inner membrane respiratory complex ; alcohol dehydrogenase ; biosynthetic genes of cytochromes such as the heme exporter ; and cytochrome maturation systems  . in addition, ten transcriptional factors are clustered with the functional genes, implicating that they function to regulate this process. although none of them has yet been experimentally characterized, we note that so <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig>  so <dig> and so <dig> are induced  <dig> – <dig>  fold in a microarray experiment of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> under anaerobic, iron-reducing conditions as compared to o2-reducing conditions . in addition, so <dig> also is induced  <dig> fold under anaerobic uranium-reducing conditions  <cit> .

the gibbs recursive sampler was used to identify the consensus sequence motif in the promoter regions of genes in the module. the search resulted in a palindromic sequence of "tgtgatctanatcaca", which was almost identical to the core binding motif of the global transcriptional factor crp   <cit> . in s. oneidensis, crp mutants were deficient in reducing fe, mn, nitrate, fumarate and dmso  <cit> . the identification of a conserved crp-binding site at the promoters of genes in this module suggests that inactivation of crp could lead to repression of multiple branches of the anaerobic energy metabolism pathway and thus to deficiency in reducing electron acceptors.

module of protein degradation
a module of protein degradation was identified in the network . these genes generally are induced by iron depletion and repressed by iron repletion . they include heat shock proteins  and heat shock protein  <dig>  system-interacting proteins   <cit> . an rpoh  binding site  was identified - <dig> and - <dig> upstream of genes in this module, which was consistent with previous observations in e. coli that rpoh was responsible for regulation of heat shock proteins  <cit> 

other biological processes
other iron-responsive biological processes are related to dna metabolism, sulfur metabolism, protein synthesis and aerobic energy metabolism. a number of genes encoding ribosomal proteins  are induced by iron repletion , which correlates well with the rapid resumption of bacterial growth after iron addition. additionally, genes related to aerobic energy metabolism are induced by iron depletion and repressed by iron repletion , possibly implying that the energy required for coping with iron depletion is greater than that required for normal growth. these genes include methylcitrate synthase , 2-methylisocitrate lyase , 2-methyl citrate dehydratase , isocitrate dehydrogenase , and malate dehydrogenase .

aexpression ratio values greater than  <dig> denote increases in gene expression and values between  <dig> and  <dig> indicate decreases in gene expression. --: not detected.

mutant analyses
to test the importance of iron acquisition genes under iron depleted conditions, a putative alcaligin biosynthesis protein so <dig> was selected for examination. a mutant of so <dig> and its parental strain dsp <dig> were compared under iron depleted conditions. the mutant displayed a severe growth defect when grown in the presence of  <dig> μm iron chelator , and had only marginal growth when grown in the presence of  <dig> μm iron chelator . this suggests that so <dig>  which is induced ~ <dig> fold after  <dig> minutes of iron depletion, is required for surviving iron starvation.

to determine the significance of a protein degradation module for iron depletion, a gene encoding a hypothetical protein  was selected for mutagenesis. this gene is located in the same operon as the heat shock protein , and its amino terminus contains a thioredoxin domain that might participate in redox reactions. recently, it was shown to be required for bacterial survival of heat shock  <cit> . although both the so <dig> mutant and its parental strain mr- <dig> grew almost indistinguishably in the absence of iron chelator  <dig> '-dipyridyl, the mutant failed to grow under iron depleted conditions after incubating for five days at 30°c . therefore, lack of so <dig> prohibited the cells' ability to survive iron depletion.

network analysis suggests that ten novel transcriptional factors might be involved in anaerobic energy metabolism. among them, one gene  was successfully inactivated from the mr- <dig> genome. the fe reduction rates of the so <dig> mutant and mr- <dig> were assessed by a ferrozine assay as described  <cit> . less than half the amount of fe was produced in the mutant as compared to mr- <dig> after four hours of incubation , indicating that disruption of so <dig> impaired anaerobic fe reduction.

we also assessed possible growth deficiency of the so <dig> mutant under anaerobic conditions with  <dig> mm lactate as the electron donor, and one of the following non-metal electron acceptors:  <dig> mm thiosulfate,  <dig> mm fumarate,  <dig> mm tmao,  <dig> mm nitrate or  <dig> mm dmso. significant growth deficiency was observed when thiosulfate or tmao was supplied . in contrast, only very mild growth deficiency was observed when dmso, fumarate or nitrate was supplied, and no growth deficiency was detected under aerobic conditions . together, these results suggest that so <dig> is involved in regulating specific branches of anaerobic energy metabolism.

discussion
in this work we show that iron response in s. oneidensis is a rapid process at both molecular and physiological levels. the use of the membrane permeable iron chelator  <dig> '-dipyridyl rapidly sequesters both intra- and extra-cellular iron  <cit> . as a result, when cells were sampled after one minute of iron depletion, functional and regulatory genes of iron acquisition systems  were induced greater than six fold. these genes appear to be direct targets of fur as evidenced by the presence of "fur boxes" in their promoters. notably, fur has a weak affinity for fe to form a repression complex  <cit> , allowing for a rapid and sensitive response to a change in iron concentration.

the identification of an anaerobic energy metabolism module for iron experiments conducted under aerobic conditions is intriguing. a straightforward explanation would be that gradually limiting oxygen induces an anaerobic response when bacteria are grown in shake flask cultures. however, we show here that s. oneidensis continues to grow and cell density continues to increase during iron depletion, a condition which should further limit the concentration of oxygen and thus up-regulate the expression of genes as an anaerobic response. the expression of genes in the anaerobic energy metabolism module does not fit this model. furthermore, a number of genes involved in aerobic response are induced by iron depletion , while genes involved in anaerobic response and not co-factored with fe are not induced by iron depletion. these genes include ubic, chorismate lyase involved in the initial steps of ubiquinone biosynthesis; ppc, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase synthesizing oxaloacetate; pta and acek, enzymes converting pyruvate to acetate during fermentation; glpk, glycerol kinase synthesizing glycerol-3-phosphate; tdh, threonine dehydrogenase involved in the supply of reducing potential; and glutamate decarboxylase , whose e. coli counterpart is highly induced by anaerobiosis  <cit> . therefore, an alternative explanation is that an anaerobic energy metabolism module may function as iron-storage proteins to release previously sequestrated iron in their protein products during iron depletion and thereby elevate the intracellular free iron pool. the use of non-essential, iron-cofactor proteins for iron homeostasis has been well documented in e. coli  <cit> . notably, a microarray study in e. coli indicates that a large number of genes related to anaerobic energy metabolism  function in iron storage  <cit> . such a mechanism seems to be present in s. oneidensis as well.

ten transcriptional regulators were grouped within the module of anaerobic energy metabolism, suggesting that they may be involved in this process. we were able to generate a mutant of one of those genes  and to experimentally verify its role in anaerobic energy metabolism. genome analyses reveal that s. oneidensis has a large repertoire of transcriptional regulators, e.g.,  <dig> two-component regulatory system proteins that enable the organism to adapt to a diversity of environmental conditions  <cit> . nevertheless, most of the transcriptional regulators remain unstudied. the grouping of transcriptional regulators in anaerobic energy metabolism is an exciting finding; understanding this process is crucial to the potential utilization of shewanella species to remediate u.s. department of energy's uranium-contaminated sites. in this regard, the rest of the transcriptional factors identified for anaerobic energy metabolism besides so <dig> are worthy of further investigation.

bioinformatics analyses suggest that genes in the anaerobic energy metabolism module may be directly regulated by crp. in e. coli, crp modulates different biological processes and responds to glucose levels as a global transcriptional factor  <cit> . however, in s. oneidensis, crp plays a critical role in anaerobic energy metabolism  <cit> . the identification of a crp-binding site in this module provides a reasonable explanation for the function of crp in multiple branches of anaerobic energy metabolism.

transcriptomics and genetic studies suggest that protein degradation is involved in iron response. lack of iron as a protein cofactor may impair the stability of a number of proteins. induction of heat shock proteins may be necessary to process denatured or misfolded proteins. intriguingly, no oxidative stress genes, such as fe-superoxide dismutase  and genes in the sos pathway   <cit> , were induced when iron was repleted. this is surprising since the excess of external iron is expected to provoke oxidative stress. it is possible that the concentration of iron used in this study is not sufficient to induce oxidative stress, or that s. oneidensis had yet not responded to oxidative stress during the period of time examined. another possibility is that s. oneidensis employs novel pathways for oxidative stress response.

in e. coli, the tca enzymes sdha and acna are controlled by the regulatory cascade of fur and the small rna ryhb. consequently, they are repressed under iron-depleted conditions  <cit> . this is not observed in s. oneidensis . indeed, we found that the expression of sdha and acna in s. oneidensis was regulated neither in the fur mutant  <cit> , nor in a strain that over-expresses ryhb , suggesting that sdha and acna are not regulated by fur and ryhb in s. oneidensis.

the regulation of iron acquisition genes by fur is affirmed both by the presence of "fur boxes" in the promoters and the abolishment of gene expression in fur mutants  <cit> . this mechanism is well conserved among γ-proteobacteria  <cit> . in contrast, it appeared that the regulation of anaerobic energy metabolism and protein degradation modules was largely fur-independent, as very similar sets of genes also were identified when a fur mutant was exposed to iron depletion and repletion conditions  <cit> . this implies that transcriptional regulators other than fur are also essential for iron response. indeed, fur-independent regulation of gene expression by iron has been observed in e. coli, v. cholera, and h. pylori  <cit> . nevertheless, we could not completely rule out the possibility of an indirect effect of fur on anaerobic energy metabolism and protein degradation. it was notable that an earlier study showed that crp was differentially expressed in a fur mutant  <cit> , despite the fact that there was no obvious "fur box" upstream of the crp orf.

CONCLUSIONS
this report provides a glimpse into the physiological and molecular events of iron response in s. oneidensis. in addition to the fur-regulated iron acquisition systems, numerous other genes are affected by changes of iron concentration. it will be interesting to further determine the mechanism of their involvement and regulation in iron response in future studies.
