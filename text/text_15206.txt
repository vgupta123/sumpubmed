BACKGROUND
aliivibrio salmonicida  is a facultative pathogen of fish responsible for causing cold-water vibriosis  in farmed atlantic salmon , sea farmed rainbow trout  and captive atlantic cod   <cit> . at the peak of its prevalence in the 1980s infected fish farms suffered heavy losses reaching 50â€“90%  <cit> . cv appeared to be effectively controlled in  <dig>  <cit>  but before vaccination was introduced, a. salmonicida was estimated to have been responsible for over 80% of disease related losses to the norwegian aquaculture industry  <cit> . although the impact of a. salmonicida on the aquaculture industry is primarily on salmonoids there is concern it poses a risk to new commercially important species for which farming is at an early stage or is planned. the decline in the wild atlantic cod population has lead to a massive expansion of cod aquaculture. in norway alone  <dig> tons of farmed cod were sold in  <dig>  which is more than twice the amount from previous year  <cit> . so far the cod farming industry has only suffered a few outbreaks of cv, and only in unvaccinated fish. however, despite this successful treatment the cv vaccine is administered by intraperitoneal injection and its use is associated with severe side-effects such as impaired growth, intra-abdominal lesions  <cit>  and adhesions in the abdominal cavity of the fish that may affect physiological functions and reduce the quality of the final product  <cit> . hence, alternative approaches and vaccines are essential.

the halophilic and psychrophilic bacterium belongs to vibrionaceae, which includes  <dig> species found in a wide range of aquatic environments in free-living forms and attached to both biotic and abiotic surfaces. plankton organisms, mainly copepods, host large populations of bacteria. the attachment to zooplankton may enhance environmental survival of vibrionaceae which are able to break down the chitinaceous exoskeleton and utilize the polysaccharides as an abundant source of carbon and nitrogen  <cit> . vibrionaceae are also found associated with, and are pathogens of, other aquatic organisms such as fish, mussels, corals, molluscs, seagrass, shrimps and squid  <cit> . currently the genome sequences of nine vibrionaceae have been published. we report here the complete genome sequence of the first fish pathogenic vibrionaceae.

during an infection a. salmonicida elicits tissue degradation, hemolysis and sepsis. clinical symptoms such as severe anaemia and extensive haemorrhages on the surface of all internal organs of the fish are commonly observed. however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that produce the pathology of these infections and the genome should provide an insight into evolution and mechanisms involved in mediating the disease. the cod isolate a. salmonicida strain lfi <dig> taken from the head kidney  of a diseased fish was chosen for sequencing in order to better understand pathogen-host interactions.

RESULTS
i. general features of the genome
the general features of the a. salmonicida strain lfi <dig>  genome are summarized in table  <dig>  the genomic g+c content of  <dig> % is relatively low in comparison to other sequenced vibrionaceae. characteristically for members of vibrionaceae  <cit>  the a. salmonicida genome consists of two circular chromosomes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb  . the presence of essential genes on chr ii indicates that this replicon is not a dispensable megaplasmid  <cit> . however unlike the other vibrionaceae sequenced lfi <dig> also carries four circular plasmids designated pvsal <dig> , pvsal <dig> , pvsal <dig>  and pvsal <dig>  which represent  <dig> % of the total genomic dna and harbour  <dig> protein coding sequences .

the functional distribution of cdss between the chromosomes is similar to that reported for other vibrionaceae  <cit> : chr i carries the majority of cdss needed for dna replication, cell division, biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. conversely, the majority of cdss involved in adapting to environmental changes, such as stress response functions, proteins associated with the cell envelope and proteins that could not be assigned any function are encoded on chr ii . from similarity searches comparing all of the lfi <dig> cdss against the cdss from the other published vibrionaceae genomes, it is apparent that a. salmonicida shares more orthologous genes with aliivibrio fischeri  than the other vibrionaceae compared . these observations are consistent with 16s rrna gene sequence analysis data  <cit>  and support the reclassification of these two species, together with aliivibrio wodanis and aliivibrio logei as a separate genus  <cit> .

the presence of multiple plasmids is characteristic of a. salmonicida  <cit>  with many which are common to isolates from diverse geographical areas in the north atlantic ocean . from plasmid profiles plasmids of the same size as pvsal <dig>  pvsal <dig> and pvsal <dig> are common to isolates from all of the above regions. however, lfi <dig> pvsal <dig> appears to be restricted to isolates from the northern parts of norway where it is found in strains alongside either pvsal <dig>  pvsal <dig> and pvsal <dig>  or together with pvsal <dig>  <cit> . pvsal <dig> harbours a tra locus containing  <dig> cdss with functions related to plasmid conjugation. this region is highly syntenic with the tra locus of the conjugation plasmid pyj <dig> identified in vibrio vulnificus  <cit>  and plasmid pes <dig> in a. fischeri  <cit> , and suggests a similar function involved in conjugation for pvsal <dig> 

plasmids pvsal <dig> and pvsal <dig> are predicted to encode acyltransferases. acyltransferases have the potential to change the acetylation state of the lipopolysaccharide  and so maybe important in providing antigenic variability of the cell surface to give better protection against the host antibody immune recognition  <cit> . in a recent study, the expression of an iron abc transporter harboured on pvsal <dig> was shown to be dependent upon iron and probably regulated by the ferric uptake regulator fur  <cit> . pvsal <dig> may therefore be important for the non-siderophore based uptake of ferrous iron. valla and colleagues  showed that a plasmid cured strain of a. salmonicida when injected through the intraperetoneal route was still able to cause cv in salmon  <cit> . therefore although these plasmids may contribute to colonisation and virulence they are not essential, at least by this route of infection.

the most striking feature of the a. salmonicida genome is the high number of insertion sequence  elements relative to other vibrionaceae. in total a. salmonicida carry  <dig> cdss  representing  <dig> whole and partial is elements , compared to only one is element in a. fischeri. these is elements can be subdivided into  <dig> different types , and fall into  <dig> different is families based on sequence similarities with defined families in the is finder database  <cit>  . the relative proportion of transposases is slightly larger in chr ii than in chr i . is element insertions have disrupted  <dig> cdss  in the chromosomes and plasmids. most of these "natural knock-outs" are probably not translated to give functional products. the distribution of the is elements suggests that the is elements present in high numbers on the chromosomes have spread to the plasmids by transposition. however, vsa <dig> and vsa <dig> are found exclusively on pvsal <dig>  vsa <dig> is restricted to pvsal <dig> and pvsal <dig> carries none of the a. salmonicida is elements. this suggests that these plasmids do not tolerate insertions or that they are relatively recent acquisitions and that pvsal <dig> is the most recently acquired. however, codon adaptation index  analysis, which measures the relative adaptiveness of the codon usage of genes towards the codon usage of highly expressed genes  <cit> , revealed that genes on pvsal <dig>  deviate more from the average genome composition  than the other plasmids . in addition the codon bias index  versus cai plot described in  <cit>  for a. salmonicida clearly showed that genes on pvsal <dig> deviate most from the genome background, suggesting that this is likely to be the most recent acquired plasmid .

ii. genome structure
compositional asymmetries  in the leading and lagging strand of dna, with bias towards g on the leading strand of the bidirectional replication fork, is a common characteristic of bacterial genomes  <cit> . it is evident from figure  <dig> that both of the a. salmonicida chromosomes show anomalies in their gc deviation. significantly is elements are found flanking all large regions showing an aberant gc deviation. since their homologous dna can serve as recombinational cross-over points they are likely to be largely responsible for the apparent anomalies  <cit> . consistent with this, whole genome comparison with a. fischeri also shows that these anomalous regions represent breaks in synteny .

by designing pcr primers to amplify across the borders of these anomalous regions we discovered that several genomic configurations may exist within a population of any given isolate . it has been suggested that this type of interreplichore recombinations have an effect on the gene dosage, whereby the continual initiation of replication folks leads to genes closer to the origin being at a higher relative gene dosage than those at the terminus. it has also been shown that gene orientation is under selection, with essential genes being preferentially encoded on the leading strand; this is hypothesised to be due to avoidence of the deleterious effects of collisions between the transcription and translation machinery  <cit> . how stable any given genomic configuration is and what affect this has on transcription in a. salmonicida is yet to be determined, but similar rapid rearrangements have been reported in other genomes with high is element loads  <cit> .

interestingly in addition to mediating homologous recombination, is elements also border three regions in the chromosome that are found duplicated in the plasmids . two such regions, each encoding three cdss from pvsal <dig> and pvsal <dig> respectively, are the flanking parts of the genomic island gi-vs <dig> . the duplicated cdss displayed nucleotide sequence identity up to 100%, and the functions of most are unknown. the third region carries four cdss of which two encode a hemolysin co-regulated protein  and a vgrg protein. both hcp and vgrg are virulence effector proteins secreted by the type vi secretion system. codon usage analysis clearly showed that the duplicated genes cluster more closely to the plasmid genes than to the genome background , which suggests that the genes originated from the plasmids. thus this recombination between is elements represents a mechanism by which to introduce new functions into the chromosome from a highly variable complement of plasmids.

the genome position, sizes, number of cdss and g+c content of the phages and gis are listed, together with a description of the most important content <dig> 

1abnormal g+c content; gc deviation; repeats flanking the ends; insertion next trnas; and the presence of phage genes.

2a complete list of the cdss are provided in .

 <dig>  gene acquisition
in addition to the plasmids and the is elements, the genome of a. salmonicida carries other mobile genetic elements, including nine prophages as well as  <dig> regions which have the characteristics of genomic islands   <cit> . the tailed phage Ï• vs <dig> present on chr i has an overall gc content of  <dig> %, slightly higher than the chromosome average . the majority of the  <dig> cdss show considerable homology and synteny to the k <dig> phage of vibrio cholerae strain o <dig>  <cit>  , but this phage is not found in any of the other sequenced vibrionaceae genomes. Ï• vs <dig> is likely to be the only complete prophage within the a. salmonicida genome . the remaining  <dig> prophage-like regions are likely to be remnants.

in total,  <dig> regions larger than  <dig> kb were identified as having atypical dna compositional and being present in a. salmonicida but absent the other vibrionaceae genomes . although the majority of cds encoded on these regions of difference are of no known function, some encode proteins involved in secretion, biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharides  and biosynthesis and uptake of siderophores .

 <dig>  duplications
in addition to the regions duplicated on the plasmids and chromosomes chr i also carries an additional perfect duplication of approximately  <dig> kb. pcr analysis of  <dig> different a. salmonicida isolates confirmed the duplication at the same locations in all tested isolates . each duplicate contains  <dig> genes, the majority encoding products involved in the biosynthesis of constituents of the lps. l-rhamnose is present in the o-antigens of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . four genes, rmlbadc, necessary for the conversion of d-glucose 1-phosphate to dtdp-l-rhamnose are present in the repeat. seven genes are similar to those found in the wav gene cluster of v. cholerae. the wav genes are responsible for the synthesis of lps core oligosaccharides  <cit> . nesper and colleges suggested that genetic exchange of wav genes could improve outer membrane stability by altering the structure of the core lps. in such case, it would provide for better adaptation to different niches. however, the duplicates in lfi <dig> are identical at the nucleotide level and homologous recombination would therefore not increase the variety of the surface molecules expressed in the bacteria. on the other hand, in haemophilus influenzae genes involved in the capsule expression are located within an  <dig> kb cap locus. up to five copies of the locus have been detected, and a relationship between the number of copies of the cap locus and the production of capsule has been demonstrated  <cit> . we speculate that the amplification may increase the gene expression and lead to increased lps production. espelid et al. observed that ball-shaped aggregates containing the protein/lipopolysaccharide vs-p <dig>  the dominant immunoreactive antigen of a. salmonicida, were released in large quantities from the bacterial membrane inside the host  <cit> . it has been suggested that much of the specific immune response of the fish may be directed against this "smoke screen"  <cit> . increased lps production by a. salmonicida could therefore be advantageous when entering a host.

 <dig>  gene loss
in total we identified  <dig> pseudogenes  containing frameshift and nonsense mutations that might disrupt expression of functional products . loss of functions seems to occur across all functional classes of products, but a striking number of transposases, transport proteins and proteins associated with the cell envelope are included in this list .

the accumulation of pseudogenes is high for genes involved in the utilisation of the polysaccharide chitin. chitin n is an insoluble homopolymer of n-acetyl-d-glucosamine , and is highly abundant in marine environments as constituents of the exoskeleton of crustaceans and zooplankton. chitin is important for the attachment of bacteria to a carrier organism such as copepods  <cit>  and known to be an important as a nutrient source  <cit> . furthermore in a recent study hunt et al. showed that the majority of genes involved in chitin degradation are conserved among the vibrionaceae  <cit> .

in a. salmonicida seven of the pseudogenes represent key components in the chitinolytic cascade  including a methyl accepting chemotaxis gene  that may be involved in motility toward chitin  <cit> , three chitinases  involved in the extracellular breakdown of chitin to chitin oligosaccharides  <cit> , a chitoporin  responsible for mediating transport of chitin oligosaccharides into the periplasma  <cit> , and a chitodextrinase  involved in the periplasmic breakdown of chitin oligosaccharides  <cit> .

in addition, several genes involved in the chitinolytic cascade are regulated by chitin oligosaccharides and a two-component chitin catabolic sensor/kinase encoded by chis  <cit> . the gene regulation on the transcriptional level is not known, but the periplasmic chitin binding protein  is required for chis-regulation . the cbp orthologue in a. salmonicida  contains a frameshift. the functional loss of genes thought to be regulated by chis/cbp is likely to have preceded, and perhaps facilitated, the degeneration of this gene.

to investigate whether the loss of these genes has impaired the ability of a. salmonicida to utilize chitin, six a. salmonicida isolates including lfi <dig> were grown on a minimal media containing either Î±-chitin n or glcnac as the only source of carbon. as a control, a. wodanis and vibrio splendidus were grown in parallel. none of the a. salmonicida isolates showed growth on n nor on glcnac . in contrast, the majority of controls grew on both the homopolymeric and monomeric form of glcnac. this implies that the loss of seven genes involved in the chitinolytic cascade have probably affected processes such as sensing, degradation and transport of chitin and suggests that the ability to catabolise chitin is no longer required by a. salmonicida. consistent with these findings preliminary studies looking for a. salmonicida in the environment have failed to find this species associated with copepods . accordingly, this could also confine the variety of carrier organisms a. salmonicida can attach to, and associate with.

it should be mentioned that programmed frameshifting and readthrough of premature stop codons are often used as methods of bacterial gene regulation  <cit> . in addition, homopolymeric dna tracts can give rise to slipped-strand mispairing during replication  <cit> . it is therefore possible that some of the predicted pseudogenes could be translated into functional products, and are retained in the genome for selective reasons. two flagellar biosynthesis genes, flif  and flag  are disrupted by premature stop codons. while the function of flag is unknown, the product of flif is the major component of the m-ring, a central motor component of the flagellum. despite the disruption of flif and flag the sequenced strain is still motile. this could imply that these genes are not essential in a. salmonicida, or that the translational machinery is able to read through the premature stop codons and produce functional products.

iv. quorum sensing
bacterial cell-to-cell communication, or quorum sensing  is a sophisticated mechanism that can allow for a synchronized gene expression of a whole community. bacteria can respond to environmental changes by monitoring the presence of other bacteria in the surroundings by producing and responding to extracellular signal molecules . a. salmonicida has five qs systems , which is more than reported in any other vibrionaceae  <cit> . however, there is extensive evidence of gene loss in these systems: luxn and luxp encoding the autoinducer receptors of the luxm/n and luxs/pq systems, respectively are pseudogenes. in addition, a. salmonicida lacks luxm and luxl, required for the production of n--l-homoserine lactone , the autoinducer of the luxm/n system  <cit>  further indicating that this system is non-functional. however, since the frameshift within luxn occurs within a homopolymeric tract  it is possible that the function of this gene could be restored by programmed frameshifting. in the absence of luxm and luxl this would allow the system to function as a "mute" system monitoring the presence of hhls produced by other bacteria.

v. potential virulence factors
little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which a. salmonicida causes disease. through detailed analysis of the genome possible functions that may be associated with mediating cv have been predicted .

the roles of several important virulence factors have been described for other vibrionaceae, such as the cholera toxin  of v. cholerae  <cit> , the thermostable hemolysin  of v. parahaemolyticus  <cit>  and the metalloprotease  of v. vulnificus  <cit> . common for ct, tdh and vvp is that they act extracellularly, and are exported from the cell by various secretion mechanisms. although none of these factors were found in a. salmonicida, the tissue damage observed in fish with cv suggests that a. salmonicida secrets proteins during an infection like these other pathogens. several protein secretion systems were identified in the genome, including three type i secretion systems , one type ii secretion system , two type vi secretion systems  and one flp-type pilus system.

the cdss of the flp-type pilus are harboured on gi-vsa <dig> and show sequence similarities and high synteny to the tad  macromolecular transport system of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the tad system is widely distributed in bacteria and secrets a pilus that is involved in adherance to surfaces  <cit> . this function is necessary for colonization and pathogenesis by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the tad genes are present and intact in a. salmonicida, a. fischeri,v. parahaemolyticus and an incomplete operon is found in both v. vulnificus strains sequenced.

functional gene-loss is evident in one t1ss, and both t6sss gene clusters . the products of the pseudogenes of the t6sss are not predicted to be structural components of the secretion apparatus  <cit> . it is therefore possible that these systems are functional in a. salmonicida. t6ssi and t6ssii are located on gi-vs <dig> and gi-vs <dig>  respectively. both systems show sequence similarities as well as considerable synteny to the v. cholerae t6ss  <cit> . virulence effector proteins secreted by t6ss lack an n-terminal signal sequence and include a hemolysin co-regulated protein  and a vgrg protein  <cit> . by sequence similarity we identified three vgrg  and three hcp  homologs in the genome. vsal_i <dig> is disrupted by the insertion of an is-element and is probably not expressed.

among the predicted cdss with the potential to cause tissue degradation and hemolysis in the fish, we have identified two cdss, vsal_i <dig> and vsal_i <dig> with 77% and 52% sequence identity to v. anguillarum hemolysins vah <dig> and vah <dig> respectively . vah <dig> and vah <dig> showed hemolytic activity against fish erythrocytes and are suggested to contribute to the hemolytic activity of v. anguillarum  <cit> . to what extent vsal_i <dig> and vsal_i <dig> can cause hemolysis of fish blood cells, as observed in fish with cv is unknown. similar to vah <dig> and vah <dig>  no export signal sequence was found for vsal_i <dig> and vsal_i <dig>  it is possible that the two putative hemolysins are exported by one or several of the a. salmonicida t1ss. in e. coli, export of hemolysin hlya is mediated by the hemolysin secretion system, which has been described as one of the prototypes of t1ss  <cit> .

a. salmonicida uses the siderophore bisucaberin to acquire iron  <cit> . a complete siderophore biosynthesis/acquisition system is contained on gi-vsa <dig> , but whether it could be responsible for the production of bisucaberin remains to be clarified. we have also identified a heme uptake system with high sequence similarity and synteny to that of many other vibrionaceae  <cit> . both transport of heme complexes, and ferric-siderophores across the outer membrane require a functional tonb system. several members of vibrionaceae possess two tonb systems  <cit> . a. salmonicida harbours three tonb systems, named tonb <dig>  tonb <dig> and tonb <dig>  in v. cholerae both tonb systems corresponding to a. salmonicida tonb <dig> and tonb <dig> are capable of mediating the transport of heme and siderophores  <cit> , while in v. anguillarum only the tonb system homologous to a. salmonicida tonb <dig> is essential for the ferric-siderophore transport and virulence  <cit> . in the tonb <dig> system, tonb <dig>  contains a translational frameshift and is probably not translated into a functional product. all three tonb systems in a. salmonicida are located adjacent to cdss with functions associated with iron-uptake. this indicates that more than one system may be involved in iron acquisition.

CONCLUSIONS
the a. salmonicida genome displays a mosaic structure  caused by large intra-chromosomal rearrangements, gene acquisition, deletion and duplication of dna within the chromosomes and between the chromosomes and the plasmids. from our sequence analysis it is clear that many of these events are mediated by homologous recombination between is elements.

multiple lines of evidence, such as compositional sequence differences, were used to identify recent gene acquisitions. the majority of the horizontally acquired dna is flanked by is elements. although the direct influence the gene acquisitions have had on the evolution and adaptation of a. salmonicida is not clear, some of the gis carry genes that may have provided new functions to the bacteria. for example, two t6ss and one flp-type pilus system that are involved in the export of proteins are located on dna segments that have the typical characteristics of gis. t6ss have been recognized as a major virulence determinant in other pathogens were they have been shown to be involved in the extracellular translocation of proteins required for cytotoxicity  <cit> . the flp-pilus system is similar to the tad macromolecular transport system of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the tad system has been proposed to represent a new subtype of t2ss and is essential for biofilm formation, colonization and pathogenesis  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the tad system shows a complex history of gene shuffling and multiple hgt among prokaryotes  <cit> . our findings support the hypothesis that the distribution of the tad genes is explained by their location on a mobile gi   <cit> . whether the protein secretion systems are important for the virulence towards fish remains to be elucidated.

over  <dig> cdss are disrupted by is elements or contain point mutations causing frameshifts or premature stop codons . a large fraction of the degenerate cdss have roles in the response to environmental changes and in modulating the host-cell interaction. the extensive loss of the same types of genes has been reported for the pathogen species mycobacterium leprae, salmonella typhi, bordetella pertussis, and others which have become host adapted  <cit> . the dna sequences of these cdss are still intact, which indicates that the gene losses are relatively recent events in a. salmonicida. is expansion has been related to genome reduction in the evolution and emergence of pathogenicity  <cit> , and accumulation of pseudogenes has been described for several other host-restricted pathogens  <cit> , supporting the hypothesis that a. salmonicida may have also become host-restricted through gene loss.

taken together, the acquisition of novel genes and loss of old functions may be related to the emergence of a. salmonicida as a pathogenic species for salmonids. the outcome of the horizontal acquisition of genes could have allowed for an expansion to a previously unexplored niche, and the accumulation of pseudogenes and is expansion resulting in massive loss of functional genes observed in a. salmonicida may be a result of selection against the expression of genes not required in the new niche, or a neutral process associated with the relaxation of selective pressure due to the evolutionary bottleneck associated with niche adaptation. the observations made for the a. salmonicida genome are similar to those of other recently-evolved host-restricted pathogens, suggesting that a. salmonicida has recently made the transition to the specific niche of fish pathogenicity.
