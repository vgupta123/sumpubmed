BACKGROUND
during tumorigenesis, cancer cells increase the production of ribosomes to support the higher rate of protein synthesis associated with cancer growth. this is supported by the increase in rrna synthesis transcribed in the nucleolus by rna polymerase i, and correlates with adverse prognosis . to contrast this mechanism, the products of rb and p <dig>  two important tumour suppressor genes, negatively interfere with the rna polymerase i and the assembly of the transcriptional machinery on the rdna promoter  <cit> . p <dig> activation is under direct control of the negative regulator mdm <dig>  which in turn is inactivated by arf. this explains why arf is pivotal for triggering the cell-cycle arrest and the apoptotic programme after oncogenic cues  <cit> . the stability of arf is significantly increased in cells that overexpress exogenous b <dig> . b <dig> associates with arf within the nucleolus, delaying its turnover. as a consequence, the inhibition of b <dig> by shrna has destabilizing effects over arf  <cit> . arf mutants unable to bind b <dig> are unstable and functionally impaired  <cit> . in mouse embryonic fibroblasts  lacking both b <dig> and p <dig>  arf is mainly found outside the nucleolus and with a shortened half-life, conferring the cells with higher proliferation rates  <cit> . b <dig> is an abundant, multifunctional protein present at high amount in the granular region of nucleoli  <cit> . it is involved in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis, and the control of genome stability and survival in response to a variety of stress stimuli . in fact, b <dig> −/− fibroblasts become aneuploid and have increased levels of p <dig> in a stable form  <cit> . conversely, b <dig> has been shown to induce senescence in normal primary fibroblasts  <cit>  and its overexpression in tumors lacking p <dig> is known to promote proliferation  <cit> . the transcription factor egr <dig>  is involved in the transcriptional regulation of responses to a wide number of proliferative, differentiation and stress stimuli  <cit> . in particular, egr <dig> regulates the expression of key genes, including p <dig>  tgfb, cdkn1a/p <dig> and pten, involved in the growth and division of cancer cells, . egr- <dig> +/− and egr- <dig> −/− mefs bypass senescence and grow as typically immortalized cells. besides to cover the role as “gatekeeper” of p53-dependent growth regulatory mechanisms  <cit> , egr <dig> has been suggested to play a role as tumour suppressor in several tumor types . we have recently demonstrated that egr <dig> behaves as a negative regulator of rna polymerase i  <cit> . egr <dig> localizes to the nucleolus and the more it is expressed the less is the 47s pre-rrna synthesized. arf is required for the nucleolar localization of egr <dig>  indeed, in cells arf −/− such as the nih-3 t <dig> egr <dig> does not keep the nucleolar localization and the ability to suppress the synthesis of the 47s ribosomal precursor  <cit> . in view of the functional interaction of arf with b <dig>  and the fact that egr <dig> regulates the transcription of arf  <cit>  we have hypothesized that egr <dig> might extend its control also on b <dig> expression. here, we show that egr <dig> promotes its stability and the transcription of b <dig> gene.

RESULTS
the expression of nucleolar b <dig> correlates with the levels of egr1
to verify our hypothesis we first monitored the effects on the expression of b <dig> in hela cells by either increasing or reducing the levels of egr <dig>  after transient transfection of the pegfp-egr <dig> expression vector, showed a six-fold increase of b <dig> mrna in low serum conditions . no changes were observed under culture conditions with 10 % fbs. accordingly, lowering the egr <dig> mrna levels with sirna specific to egr <dig> sequence, we observed a significant reduction of b <dig> mrna levels compared to cells treated with non-specific  sirna . here again, the inhibitory effect on b <dig> mrna synthesis was observed only in cells cultured in low serum conditions, and not in presence of 10 % fbs. similar changes were observed with the b <dig> protein synthesis under the same experimental conditions. in summary, in condition of serum deprivation the b <dig> mrna and protein levels increased after egr <dig> overexpression and decreased after egr <dig> silencing.fig.  <dig> b <dig> levels are directly correlated to egr <dig> under serum deprivation. egr <dig> and b <dig> expression in hela cells transfected with a gfp fused full length egr <dig>  or incubated with sirna specific for egr <dig> . a control empty vector for gfp  or a scrambled sequence of the sirna egr <dig>  were used for comparison, respectively. experiments were carried out in medium with either  <dig>  % or 10 % fcs. relative levels of b <dig> and egr <dig> mrna were quantitated by rt-qpcr in cells transfected with egr1-gfp or control gfp , and in cells incubated with sirna egr <dig> or control sirna scrambled . protein signal ratios of egr <dig> and b <dig> to gapdh were quantitated by densitometry in cells transfected with egr1-gfp or control gfp , and in cells incubated with sirna egr <dig> or control sirna scrambled , limitedly to serum deprived conditions. immunoblot of egr <dig> and b <dig> proteins from a representative experiment . data are the mean +/− s.e. of three independent experiments. comparisons were performed by t-test. significant results are highlighted with asterisks 



to verify that the above results in hela cells are not dependent upon the specific cellular context, we replicated the experiments with a primary culture of human lung tumor and a glioblastoma derived established cell line, u87mg and 293 t . in all these cultures the b <dig> mrna and protein underwent variations in their levels similar to those observed in hela under the same experimental conditions. we conclude that the levels of b <dig> expression are strongly influenced by egr <dig> under lower fbs concentration, a known stress inducing condition.

to investigate whether egr <dig> can influence the expression of b <dig> under different stress conditions, we sought to examine their response to actinomycin d, a genotoxic agent known to inhibit the rna polymerase i and ii activity and to induce dna damage  <cit> . the levels of egr <dig> and b <dig> mrna and protein showed a step-wise increase when cells were treated with increasing concentrations  of actinomycin d . also the expression of p <dig>  a specific egr <dig> target gene, increases, whereas the synthesis of 47s and 45s is strongly inhibited, as shown in fig. 2c-d. pre-treatment with egr <dig> silencing sirna abolished the response of b <dig> and p <dig> genes and restored the production of 47s rrna . finally, we asked the question of whether the b <dig> protein would translocate to the nucleoplasm in response to pol i-induced transcription repression, as suggested by yao z. et al.  <cit> . we confirm that in our experimental conditions actinomycin d causes the translocation of b <dig> to the nucleoplasm .fig.  <dig> actinomycin d induces egr <dig> and b <dig>  relative mrna levels of egr <dig>  b <dig>  47s,45s pre-rrna and p <dig>  expressed in hela cells treated with actinomycin d for 1 h at 37 ° c . the smaller inserts in the panels compare the effect of sirna egr <dig> plus actinomycin d to that of actinomycin d alone. quantitative evaluation of egr <dig> and b <dig> proteins under the effect of actinomycin d, together with a representative immunoblot, are shown in panel e to g. data are the mean +/− s.e. of three independent experiments. comparisons were performed by one way anova. significant results are highlighted with asterisks 



egr <dig> binds to b <dig> promoter
since the levels of b <dig> expression vary in response to egr <dig>  we hypothesized that as a transcriptional regulator it might control the b <dig> expression by interacting with the promoter. to verify this hypothesis, we first searched the b <dig> promoter  for the presence of canonical sequences that were recognized and bound by-egr <dig> 

by-bioinformatics-approach  one of such elements was found at −172 bp to the tata box . to establish the function of the putative egr <dig> binding site, we cloned a partial sequence of the b <dig> promoter  from hela dna and inserted into a luciferase reporter gene to assay the responsiveness to the activity of egr <dig>  as above, egr <dig> was exogenously expressed following transient transfection of the pegfp-egr <dig> expression vector. all experiments were carried out in hela cells cultured in low serum conditions . the b <dig> minimal promoter carrying the sequence of the egr <dig> binding site found in hela was successfully transactivated by the exogenously expressed egr <dig>  providing high levels of luciferase activity . no luciferase activity was detected when the b <dig> minimal promoter was deleted of the sequence or carried a mutated version of the egr <dig> binding site and tested in the same conditions as above .fig.  <dig> identification of the egr1-binding sequence required for b <dig> promoter induction. a the human b <dig> promoter sequence, partial. an egr <dig> binding motif is underlined at position − <dig> from the tata box. a schematic representation of the wt sequence of b <dig> promoter and a copy with a mutated egr <dig> binding site cloned upstream of renilla luciferase gene . b the luciferase assay in hela cells transfected with egr1-gfp or the control gfp in combination with either of the two luciferase vectors  plus a beta-galactosidase vector for normalization of transfection efficiency. all experiments were done under serum deprivation conditions. c real time pcr of hela cells extracts either transfected with full length egr <dig> or control gfp were incubated with dna fragments amplified from the promoter sequence of b <dig> gene, in presence or absence of anti-egr <dig> antibody



in vitro dna binding assays were performed to establish whether egr <dig> specifically associated with the minimal b <dig> promoter. we incubated dna fragments of the promoter sequence with anti-egr <dig> antibody in presence of extracts of hela cells either transfected with full length egr <dig> or egfp  <cit> . cells were cultured either in low serum conditions or at 10 % fbs. an abundant  enrichment of promoter sequences was obtained by rt-qpcr  and pcr  only with extracts of cells transfected with egr <dig> and cultured in low serum. no statistically significant differences were detected in 10 % fbs. furthermore, when the pcr was performed with oligonucleotides specific for a region located upstream the minimal b <dig> promoter no amplification products were obtained .

b <dig> expression is downregulated in the brain of egr <dig> −/− mice
in order to gain further evidence about the role of egr <dig> as a regulator of b <dig> expression, we compared the levels of b <dig> mrna and protein from brain of egr <dig> −/− with egr <dig> +/+ mice. since egr <dig> is present at high levels in mouse and human brain  <cit>  but not, the levels of b <dig> expression should likely be different in the brain of wild-type compared to egr <dig> −/− mice, in case b <dig> were regulated by egr <dig>  a significant reduction of b <dig> mrna and protein was detected in the brain of egr <dig> −/− mice .fig.  <dig> b <dig> is downregulated in egr <dig> −/− mouse brain. a b <dig> mrna and b-c protein levels in egr <dig> +/+ and egr <dig> −/− mice. whole brain extracts  were obtained from nine wt and egr <dig> −/− female three month old mice. the egr <dig> protein was quantified as relative to that of gapdh taken as control. comparisons were performed by t-test. significant results are highlighted with asterisks 



b <dig> increases the egr <dig> steady-state level of expression
b <dig> plays an important role in cell growth by regulating the function of proteins such as arf and p <dig>  <cit> . this is accomplished by delaying the turnover of these proteins, thus contributing to the activation of suppressor activities aimed to the control of cell cycle. in the case of arf, a physical interaction with b <dig> has been demonstrated which protected arf from proteasomal degradation  <cit> . we asked the question of whether a similar interaction might exist also between egr <dig> and b <dig>  if b <dig> stabilizes egr <dig>  then a fall in the b <dig> synthesis would likely translate into a change in the detectable levels of egr <dig>  due to a loss of stability. to test this hypothesis, we treated the hela cells with 30nm b <dig> specific sirna, and monitored the expression of both genes egr <dig> and b <dig>  we show that following a decrease of b <dig> mrna and protein, the levels of egr <dig> mrna remained unchanged . however, the levels of egr <dig> protein detected by immunoblotting were significantly lower . we also confirm that under the same experimental conditions the level of 47s pre-rrna increased whereas the level of p <dig> diminished, both significantly . to investigate whether the lower levels of egr <dig> protein following b <dig> silencing were the result of a proteasome-dependent degradation, we tested in hela cells the effect of the proteasome inhibitor mg- <dig>  on the stability of egr <dig> during b <dig> silencing after  <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h. only after 16 h from the treatment the levels of egr <dig> did actually increase . these experiments clearly suggest the partial involvement of proteasome machinery on egr <dig> turnover, and that, egr <dig> stability and accumulation within the nucleolus is likely regulated by b <dig> fig.  <dig> egr <dig> protein level is linked to b <dig>  analysis of egr <dig> after b <dig> sirna in hela cells grown at  <dig>  % fbs. a immunoblotting of egr <dig> and b <dig> in whole extracts of hela cells after b <dig> sirna. egr <dig> protein significantly decreases following endogenous b <dig> silencing at  <dig> nm. b-c-d-e real time pcr analysis of b <dig>  egr <dig>  p <dig> mrna and 47s pre-rrna under b <dig> silencing. the level of expression of egr <dig> remained unchanged . as expected p <dig> mrna decrease  while the 47s rrna levels increase levels . f-g immunoblotting of egr <dig> under mg- <dig> treatment after b <dig> sirna for  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h. the level of egr <dig> protein is restored during b <dig> silencing after treatment with proteosome inhibitor at 10 μm for 16 h at 37 ° c. comparison tests were performed by one way anova and significant results are highlighted with asterisks 



discussion
b <dig>  is the best studied member of the npm family of chaperones, a highly conserved protein found in humans, rodents, chicken and fish. human b <dig> is mapped to chromosome 5q <dig> and is made up of  <dig> exons. b <dig>  first isolated from xenopus laevis oocyte extracts  <cit>  is a histone storage protein affecting many intracellular processes such as: i) the rate of ribosome synthesis by binding to pre-ribosomal complexes; ii) dna duplication and transcriptional regulation; iii) nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and assistance to small basic proteins such as rev, rex, tat and p <dig> for transport to the nucleolus . within the nucleolus, b <dig> binds to arf. the interaction with b <dig> increases arf stability by interfering with the action of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

in a recent publication, we have shown that the transcriptional factor egr <dig> also localizes to the nucleolus and acts as negative regulator of rna polymerase i activity, similarly to p <dig>  <cit> . both b <dig> and egr <dig> are activated and expressed under at least two different stress stimuli, i.e., after uv exposure and h2o <dig> treatment  <cit> . we do not know whether the two genes are independently. to investigate this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments where hela cells grown in serum deprived conditions and treated either to express high levels of exogenous egr <dig> or to silence the expression of the endogenous egr <dig> gene, were examined for changes in the localization and the expression of b <dig> mrna and protein, and in the regulation of 47s and 45s pre-rrna synthesis. the above results show that both pre-rrnas  have a rise in their levels when egr <dig> is silenced. though very preliminar this observation leading us to hypothesize that the regulation of 47s could be not an abortive transcription. however, further investigations will help us to clarify this point. here we show that in hela cells the levels of b <dig> mrna and protein increase after egr <dig> overexpression, and decrease after egr <dig> silencing. we know that this correlation is not cell specific. in fact, very similar results were obtained also with established glioma cell line and a primary culture of lung adenocarcinoma. in addition, the same effect can be assumed in vivo for the brain of b <dig> by comparing the expression levels of b <dig> in the brain of egr <dig> −/− with that from egr <dig> +/+ mice. an investigation of the human and mouse b <dig> promoter nucleotide sequence allowed the recognition of a potential egr <dig> binding site, which proved to be effective in a reporter gene transactivation assay. the association of egr <dig> to the b <dig> promoter was further demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation . it has been shown that following dna damage b <dig> binds to chromatin  <cit>  and to other proteins as well, such as gadd <dig>  <cit> , the retinoblastoma protein prb  <cit> , parp <dig> and parp <dig>  <cit> . they are all intimately linked to the maintenance of dna structure, replication or repair. following treatment with actinomycin d, nucleolar b <dig> protein undergoes a rapid translocation to the nucleoplasm  <cit> . here we confirm these data and find that the levels of both egr <dig> and b <dig> increase with different concentrations of the drug. however, if cells are treated under conditions inhibiting the expression of egr <dig>  then the levels of b <dig> remain constant. one of the mechanism of actinomycin d is inhibit the transcription by intercalating with dna, in particular at the gc-rich rna polymerase i genes. in our experiments egr <dig> seem to facilitate the action of genotoxic drug. we have already demonstrate in a previous paper that egr <dig> bind ubf protein and the formation of this proteins complex could help the action of actinomycin d on the inhibition of rna polymerase i gene. this is only one of the possible scenario further experiments will help to clarify the role of egr <dig> under actinomycin action. these data further suggest a direct role for egr <dig> in regulating the expression of b <dig>  and that the correlation between egr <dig> and b <dig> is maintained under several conditions of cellular stress. several studies have demonstrated the involvement of b <dig> in the p <dig> tumor suppressor pathway. colombo et al. found that b <dig> when overexpressed promotes cellular senescence in fibroblasts and regulates the stability of p <dig> through direct interaction  <cit> . further, in response to nucleolar stress, b <dig> does promote the stabilization of arf protein  <cit> . in view of the multiple interactions that link b <dig> to the above molecules and likely to egr <dig>  we finally studied the effects of b <dig> over egr <dig>  indeed, by inhibiting the expression of b <dig> we observed a reduction of egr <dig> protein levels but not of egr <dig> mrna. since mg- <dig>  a proteosomal inhibitor, can reduce this effect we speculate that b <dig> might have a role for keeping adequate levels of the intracellular concentration of egr <dig> following stress conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, these findings provide the evidence that b <dig> is regulated by egr <dig> under stress conditions, and highlights egr <dig> as an important link of the arf-b23-rrna nucleolar network  <cit> , regulating ribosome biogenesis and promoting growth arrest.
