BACKGROUND
ocimum sanctum l.  is an important sacred medicinal plant of india known as “holy basil”, thulasi, vishnupriya, and tulsi  <cit>  and worshipped for over more than  <dig> years  <cit> . this herb is popular in traditional medicine as “the queen of herbs,” “the incomparable one,” and “the mother medicine of nature”  <cit> . being legendary sacred basil , is recognized  <cit>  not only for its sanctity, but forms an indispensible part of the traditional herbal medicine of east as discussed in ayurvedic text of charaka samhita as well as unani medicinal system. it is native to india and parts of northern and eastern africa, hainan island, and taiwan, and grows wild throughout india up to an altitude of  <dig> ft  in the himalayas . the leaf of the plant owes a stronger, somewhat pungent taste than other basils due to a sesquiterpenoid beta-caryophyllene, and a phenylpropanoid eugenol  <cit> . o. sanctum has been suggested to possess anti-fertility, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-fungal, anti-microbial, cardioprotective, analgesic, anti-spasmodic and adaptogenic actions  <cit> . the chemical composition of tulsi is highly complex, containing many biologically active phytochemicals with variable proportions among varieties or even plants within the same field. the volatile oil of leaf  <cit>  contains eugenol , euginal, urosolic acid  <cit> , carvacrol, limatrol, caryophyllene, methyl carvicol while the seed volatile oil has fatty acids and sitosterol. in addition, the seed mucilage contains some levels of sugars and the anthocyans are present in green leaves  <cit> . the leaf volatiles  are synthesized and sequestered in glandular hairs present on the leaves, also known as peltate trichomes, which are the characteristic of lamiaceae members  <cit> . two types of o. sanctum l. are used for cultivation:  plants with green leaves known as sri/ rama tulsi &  plants with purple leaves known as krishna/ shyama tulsi  <cit> . furthermore, the quantity of many of its constituents can be significantly altered by varying conditions used for growing; harvesting, processing and storage that are not yet well understood  <cit> . all of the varieties of ocimum have unique and individual chemical compositions; but their medicinal properties are not yet explored completely. despite huge importance of ocimum, very little transcriptomic and genomic data of ocimum sp. is available limiting studies on important phytochemical pathways. but comparative transcriptome analysis of ocimum species  was recently reported  <cit> . this report correlated higher digital expression of phenylpropanoid/ terpenoid pathway genes of o. basilicum to higher essential oil content and chromosome number . also several cytochrome p450s  and transcription factor families  were identified which could be utilized to characterize genes related to secondary metabolism and its regulation.

hence, there was a need to know about the genome of this plant to understand its metabolic potential, diversity, regulation and evolutionary implications. here, we report the draft nuclear genome sequence of  <dig> mb and the plastid of  <dig>  bp sequenced with a composite next generation sequencing technologies. on the basis of assembly,  <dig>  protein coding genes were identified. gene model prediction revealed the similarity of o. sanctum genome to nicotiana tabacum and solanum lycopersicum, all sharing same sub-class .

RESULTS
genome sequencing, assembly and validation
a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy by generating long and short paired-end reads, along with long reads and mate-pair libraries was applied to assemble the  <dig> mb genome sequence of o. sanctum. the process workflow of the same has been provided in the fig.  <dig>  two libraries  of illumina hiseq <dig>  one library of  <dig> gs flx and one mate-pair library of solid 5500xl were constructed. illumina libraries were used to generate the contigs and illumina paired-end data along with  <dig> gs flx single end data were used for contig merging as a result of which scaffolds were generated. while illumina generated  <dig>  gb data ,  <dig> sequencing resulted in  <dig>  mb  data and solid generated  <dig>  gb  data representing approximately ~130-fold coverage of the predicted o. sanctum genome. with the help of the two illumina library data  the assembly showed significant improvement in respect of n <dig>  long- and short-paired end reads from illumina deep sequencing was used to assemble a total of  <dig>  contigs into  <dig>  scaffolds. super-scaffolding was performed in order to merge the existing gap-closed scaffolds into super-scaffolds using relative orientation of solid mate pair reads. finally,  <dig> super-scaffolds of maximum length upto  <dig> , <dig> bp were generated . out of the total super-scaffolds generated,  <dig> super-scaffolds are larger than or equal to  <dig> kb in length . the n <dig> length of contigs, scaffolds and super-scaffolds was found to be  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp respectively . the total length of the gaps in the assembled scaffolds was  <dig>  mb in a total of  <dig> super-scaffolds. the total number of gaps present is  <dig>  considering even the presence of a single n as one gap. the biggest gap identified was of  <dig> bp in length. mate-pair reads significantly closed ~ <dig> % of gaps between scaffolds and five-fold change in n <dig> value and n <dig> value was also observed where n <dig> increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  while n <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in order to validate the genome assembly, a total of  <dig>  transcripts generated from our previous study  <cit>  were mapped to the genome data and more than  <dig> % transcripts  showed  <dig> % coverage .fig.  <dig> process workflow of ocimum sanctum whole genome sequencing and assembly



de-novo assembly of chloroplast and mitochondria genome data
the complete chloroplast  genome of o. sanctum is  <dig>  bp in length . recently, qian et al  <cit>  had reported the chloroplast genome of salvia miltiorrhiza to be the smallest with the exception of epifagus virginiana  <cit>  cp genome of order lamiales. but this investigation revealed o. sanctum cp genome to be  <dig> bp smaller than s. miltiorrhiza  cp genome of length  <dig>  bp. hence o. sanctum cp genome is now reported as the smallest of the lamiales cp genomes as it is ~ <dig> bp smaller than e. virginiana cp genome. the overall gc content of the o. sanctum cp genome is  <dig>  %, which is similar to the other reported asterid cp genomes . the o. sanctum cp genome was found to code a total  <dig> genes, including  <dig> transfer rna  genes and four ribosomal rna  genes. the aligned reads of cp genome of o. sanctum to other angiosperms  were assembled into contigs for finally generating the scaffolds using all the illumina data. similar procedure was carried out for mitochondrial genome  assembly except considering s. miltiorrhiza as the reference mitochondial genome. a total of  <dig> scaffolds from  <dig> contigs from cp genome, and  <dig> scaffolds from  <dig> contigs  from the mitochondrial genome got generated.fig.  <dig> gene map of the ocimum sanctum chloroplast genome genes drawn inside the circle are transcribed clockwise, and those outside are counterclockwise. genes belonging to different functional groups are color-coded. the darker gray in the inner circle corresponds to gc content, while the lighter gray corresponds to at content



genomic composition and ssr prediction
gc content is an important indicator of the genomic composition including evolution, gene structure , gene regulation and stability of dna  <cit> . average gc content of o. sanctum was  <dig>  %. earlier researchers have reported that across the broad phylogenetic sweep, genome size may be correlated with intron size , suggesting that some fraction of genome size evolution takes place within genes  <cit> . while performing the annotation of gene models, taking n. tabacum and s. lycopersicum as references, it was found that the percent genes containing introns from these plants were  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively . it has been observed that introns and their positions are highly conserved during land plant evolution excluding conifers  <cit> .

comparative studies had revealed that intron lengths and the abundance of mobile repetitive elements have a direct correlation with genome size, such that large genomes have longer introns and a higher proportion of mobile elements  <cit> . intron sizes in the genes of o. sanctum ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp . a reason for intron size variation among organisms may be due to inherent mutational processes generating insertions and deletions . it was also reported that low distribution of recombination regions leads to increased intron size  <cit> .

among different classes of molecular markers, microsatellite or simple sequence repeat  markers are the most preferred for its array of applications in plant genetics and breeding due to their multi-allelic nature, reproducibility, co-dominant inheritance with high abundance and wide genome coverage  <cit> . a total of  <dig> sequences greater than  <dig> bp length were examined for ssr search out of which  <dig> sequences were found having ssr repeats while  <dig> sequences showed the presence of more than one ssr . a sum of  <dig>  ssrs were predicted, with the highest being mono-repeats  and  complex ssr’s. the sequences were checked for mono-repeats occurring at-least  <dig> times, di-repeats occurring at-least  <dig> times and tri/ tetra/ penta/ hexa-repeats occurring atleast  <dig> times. the ssr was classified as complex when two ssr’s were present within  <dig> bp distance of each other. on the other side,  <dig> , <dig> sequences of less than  <dig> bp were identified, only  <dig> ssrs highest being mono-repeats  followed by complex ssr’s  . previously, we reported ssrs from the transcriptome of o. sanctum  <cit>  but the ssrs identified were very few in comparison to the present report. similarly, efforts were made by researchers towards the development of molecular markers in order to carry out genetic diversity studies on ocimum sp. . but, ssrs reported from the present study with a large data set would be helpful in providing insights to the plant breeders and geneticists for evaluation of desired genotypes with varied essential oil compositions and also for further development of new species of ocimum.fig.  <dig> frequency distribution of ssrs based on motif types. p1: mono-nucleotide repeats; p2: di-nucleotide repeats; p3: tri-nucleotide repeats, p4: tetra-nucleotide repeats; p5: penta-nucleotide repeats; p6: hexa-nucleotide repeats; complex: no. of ssrs involved in compound formation



a gene density of ~ <dig> genes per  <dig> kb and ~ <dig> genes per  <dig> kb was observed in o. sanctum gene model prediction taking n. tabacum  and s. lycopersicum , respectively as references. since o. sanctum is a small genome plant, the gene density is similar to that of arabidopsis thaliana i.e., upto  <dig> genes per  <dig> kb  <cit> . large genomes like barley and wheat show a gene density of about  <dig> genes per  <dig> kb  <cit>  as it was suggested that the larger genomes would have accumulated non-coding sequences between the single-copy genes  <cit> .

gene prediction and annotation
in order to assign putative functions to the predicted genes of o. sanctum, they were compared against the nr  protein sequences of arabidopsis. the associated hits were searched for their respective go. based on sequence homology,  <dig>  protein sequences were categorized into  <dig> functional groups under three main categories: biological processes , cellular components  and molecular functions  . genes were predicted from  <dig>  scaffolds by mapping  the predicted proteins with uniprot with all viridiplantae clade protein sequences. out of  <dig>  protein coding loci from  <dig>  scaffolds, a total of  <dig>  were annotated with uniprot  but only  <dig>  protein coding genes were found to be unique. on observing the plant species distribution of hits to uniprot database, maximum hits were from the plant genlisea aurea  which is one of the smallest known genome among higher plants  <cit> . the number of unique protein coding genes  in the o. sanctum genome, was in range as reported in potato, tomato  <cit> , neem  <cit>  and grapevine  <cit> , having  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  protein coding genes, respectively.fig.  <dig> pie-chart showing top  <dig> functional classes in each of the  <dig> categories of gene ontology classification. the three main categories are: biological process, cellular component and molecular function representing the assignment o. sanctum predicted proteins with blast matches in nr  protein sequences of arabidopsis to each go term



ab initio gene model prediction was performed on scaffold sequences utilizing minimal information from the nearest available species. overall,  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins were predicted using training sets of nicotiana tabacum and solanum lycopersicum respectively. a total of  <dig>  proteins were common between the two predictions. gene annotation of the predicted proteins with blastp resulted in annotation of  <dig>  nr proteins. a set of  <dig>  of these annotated proteins were common to the predictions from n. tabacum and s. lycopersicum, respectively. the un-annotated predicted proteins were scanned with pfam and another  <dig>  proteins got annotated with a predicted domain signature. database annotation of assembled scaffold sequences greater than  <dig> bp was carried out for matching with the est/mrna sequences available for ocimum in the ncbi databases . a total of  <dig>  est and  <dig> mrna were queried, with a match to the assembled scaffolds for  <dig>  of the est/mrna sequences at greater than  <dig> % sequence identity. also arabidopsis sequences  from tair database and n. tabacum  and s. lycopersicum  sequences from ncbi were blast- checked against the o. sanctum scaffolds with percent hitting scaffolds of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. database annotation of est/mrna from ncbi datasets identified the mitochondria and chloroplast expressed proteins. all of the  <dig> scaffolds identified were annotated to potentially map to these sequences . out of  <dig> scaffolds,  <dig> were redundant and only  <dig> were non-redundant. on the basis of annotation of chloroplast and mitochondria encoded proteins against tair database, it was found that out of  <dig> non-redundant scaffolds of o. sanctum,  <dig> were chloroplastic while remaining  <dig> were mitochondrial.

phylogenetic analysis
 to identify the phylogenetic position of o. sanctum within the asterid lineage, multiple sequence alignments was performed using  <dig> protein-coding genes  commonly present in the  <dig> complete cp genomes representing  <dig> families within five orders of asterids including apiaceae, araliaceae, asteraceae, convolvulaceae, gesneriaceae, lamiaceae, oleaceae, pedaliaceae, rubiaceae and solanaceae . two additional eudicot cp genomes, spinacia oleracea and arabidopsis thaliana, were set as outgroups. a phylogenetic tree was generated using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood method . bootstrap analysis showed that there were  <dig> out of  <dig> nodes with bootstrap values > <dig> %, and  <dig> of these had a bootstrap value of  <dig> %. the tree topologies formed two major clades, euasterids i and ii. the results strongly supported the position of ocimum sanctum and salvia miltiorrhiza with  <dig> % bootstrap from the same family lamiaceae as the sister of the closely related species sesamum indicum and boea hygrometrica in the order lamiales. as the chloroplast genome is considered to be free from evolutionary processes, like gene duplication/ deletion, intensive evolution and pseudogene formation, which are characteristically frequent among nuclear genes, this was included in the phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . slow rate of sequence evolution in chloroplast dna is appropriate to include cp genome in phylogenetic studies of the highly cross pollinated plant like o. sanctum  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the phylogenetic tree of the asterid clade based on  <dig> protein-coding genes of chloroplast genome. numbers above each node are bootstrap support values. spinacea oleracea and arabidopsis thaliana were set as outgroups



pathway identification
to identify the biological pathways functional in o. sanctum  <dig>  protein sequences from scaffolds were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in kegg taking arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa as reference organisms, out of which only  <dig> proteins got predicted in kaas . all transcripts were classified mainly under five categories: metabolism, cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing and others. highest numbers of sequences were related to metabolism. maximum percentage of the sequences fell under the category of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. o. sanctum is good source of phenylpropene- eugenol and is one of the compounds which attributes to its medicinal property  <cit> . precursor molecules for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis are derived from the shikimate pathway while terpenoid biosynthesis utilizes isoprenoid precursors from cytosolic mva  as well as plastidial mep pathways   <cit> . on sorting  <dig>  protein coding genes of o. sanctum annotated from uniprot for phenylpropanoid  and terpenoid  pathway genes  it was found that the highest number of phenylpropanoid pathway genes were identified as compared to the terpenes. since the o. sanctum variety used in the present study is high-yielding, eugenol-rich, oil producing variety  <cit>  with  <dig> % eugenol in the oil, it correlates with the presence of higher number of phenylpropanoid pathway genes. interestingly, highest number transcripts of copalyl diphosphate synthase  were present among the mevalonate pathway genes . this enzyme participates in gibberellin biosynthesis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> abundance of phenylpropanoid, mevalonate and non- mevalonate pathway genes as per the annotation of predicted genes against all viridiplantae clade genes in uniprot. 



not only gibberellins, but a wide range of secondary metabolites, including terpenes and alkaloids, are also derived either from ent-copalyl pyrophosphate itself or from ent-kaurene or ent-kaurenoic acid, the next two intermediates in the metabolic pathway to gibberellins. knowledge of these secondary metabolic pathways is very much limited as compared to gibberellin biosynthetic pathway, and is often little more than a speculation  <cit> . further functional characterization studies for copalyl diphosphate synthase may help in proving the possibility of cps involvement in terpene and alkaloid biosynthesis.

medicinal nature of o. sanctum
in this analysis o. sanctum cp genome was observed to be evolutionarily nearest to s. miltiorrhiza. in the absence of complete genome sequence data  of s. miltiorrhiza, the chloroplast genome comparison analysis was taken into account. both the plants are used widely in two different traditional medicine systems , and hence may be implicated for similar molecules, activities vis a vis the genes biosynthesizing metabolites. in addition, both plants have chromosome number described to be 2n =  <dig>  <cit> . the active ingredients in s. miltiorrhiza are both hydrophilic  and lipophilic diterpene components   <cit> . these molecules are responsible for a wide array of activities like anti-bacterial, anti-oxidative and anti-viral to hepatoprotective activities. the chemical composition of tulsi is highly complex, and the important are triterpene like urosolic acid , phenolics like rosmarinic acid, apigenin, cirsimaritin, isothymusin and isothymonin , and important aroma components like  <dig>   <dig> cineole, linalool, methyl chavicol  and eugenol  <cit> . phenolic acid compounds production by hairy root culture have been reported in both o. basilicum and s. miltiorrhiza  <cit> . in addition, the vast literature indicates phenylpropanoid derivatives in these two plants are responsible for a range of major activities. in this investigation also we could observe the dominance of phenylpropanoid pathway genes. the highest number of sequences among the mevalonate pathway genes in o. sanctum are observed to be homologous to copalyl diphosphate synthases , that are involved in the biosynthesis of an important bioactive diterpene tanshinone in s. miltiorrhiza  <cit> . as o. sanctum is traditionally used for many aliments and the compounds of this plant are not fully investigated, the possibility exists for the discovery of tanshinone like compounds and other novel diterpenes.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome of holy basil, assembled de novo in this study, presents the smallest nuclear genome in the family lamiaceae and smallest cp genome in the order lamiales. phylogenetically, s. miltiorrhiza is most similar to o. sanctum with a reported genome size of approximately ~ <dig> mb  <cit> . although, both s. miltiorrhiza and o. sanctum predominantly produce phenylpropanoids and both have the identical diploid number of chromosome , the genome size of o. sanctum is little more than half of the genome size of s. miltiorrhiza. hence, o. sanctum genome  seems to be quite compact with relatively less repeat sequences, even though it falls in the identical phylogenetic clade. in contrast to the genome sizes of the plants used in the gene model prediction like solanum lycopersicum  and nicotiana tabacum , o. sanctum genome  falls in the category of the plants with small genome and is just  <dig>  times that of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana  while approximately same size as that of oryza sativa   <cit> .

besides the saturated genome sequence, this investigation also provides an assembled chloroplast genome, showing highest similarity to that of s. miltiorrhiza, an important medicinal plant of traditional chinese medicine. both the plants are rich in phenylpropanoids and their derivatives, and many of these are implicated for different therapeutic activities. the presence of large number of homologs of copalyl diphosphate synthases  in o. sanctum genome indicates the possibility of finding newer diterpenes having potential bioactivity not implicated so far. genomic information generated in this investigation not only is an important resource for evolutionary studies it will also catalyze modern genetic research by augmenting the data available for plant comparative genomics. this will also accelerate identification of important secondary metabolite-synthesizing genes, not identified yet from this medicinal and aromatic plant. specific pathway related genes identified or mined in this genome could be used for the production of secondary metabolites following synthetic biology approaches. genetic markers can be developed based on these genome sequences for studies involving genetic map construction, positional cloning, strain identification and marker-assisted selection. these molecular tools and genomic resources will accelerate molecular breeding and ultimately holy basil’s utility in medical community.
