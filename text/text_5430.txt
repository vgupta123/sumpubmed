BACKGROUND
west nile virus  is a single stranded positive sense rna virus of the genus flavivirus. the 11kb rna genome is translated in the cytoplasm as a polyprotein and processed to yield  <dig> structural  and seven non-structural  proteins  <cit> . co-expression of prm and e proteins alone is sufficient for production of recombinant vlps  <cit>  that are similar to infectious virions in antigenic properties and have been commonly used to study virus assembly and budding. although the field of flavivirus assembly and release remains in its infancy, recent reports have identified certain residues in the prm that are important for wnv particle secretion  <cit> . it is known that wnv genome replication occurs in the cytoplasm in the perinuclear region and virus particles assemble and bud into the endoplasmic reticulum  lumen. subsequently virions are transported to the plasma membrane  via the cellular secretory pathway to be released from cells by exocytosis  <cit> .

following the synthesis of viral genome and proteins, enveloped viruses utilize cellular membranes to bud from infected cells. this is often facilitated by the presence of certain conserved motifs within viral proteins and their ability to interact with the cellular processes/machinery. the best known example of this process is the interaction of retroviral late domain motifs with components of the escrt  sorting machinery to promote budding. three types of consensus late domain motifs have been identified thus far:  the pt/sap motif recruits the escrt- <dig> component tsg <dig>   <cit> ,  the yxxl late domain motif interacts with the escrt associated protein alix  <cit>  and the  ppxy late domain motif binds to the nedd <dig> family of e <dig> ubiquitin ligases that are involved in cargo recruitment during multivesicular body  formation  <cit> . besides retroviruses, late domain motifs have also been identified in other enveloped viruses like rhabdoviruses   <cit> , filoviruses   <cit> , arenaviruses   <cit> , paramyxoviruses   <cit>  and dna viruses like hepatitis b virus, vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus- <dig> and epstein barr virus  <cit> . amongst flaviviruses, the ns <dig> of japanese encephalitis virus  has been shown to associate with tsg <dig>  <cit>  while the yellow fever virus  ns <dig> has been shown to interact with alix  <cit>  assisting in virus release. however, currently there is no information on the presence of late domains in wnv proteins.

the process of wnv budding into the lumen of the er is topologically similar to the process of mvb biogenesis in that both occur in a direction that is away from the cytosol. mvb biogenesis is mediated by the family of escrt proteins namely escrt- <dig>  -i, -ii and -iii and other associated proteins like alix/aip <dig>  the membrane associated escrt-iii complexes are finally disassembled and recycled by the atpase vps <dig>  a number of enveloped viruses via the conserved late  domain motifs that mimic similar motifs in cellular proteins are able to recruit the escrt machinery to the site of virus budding  <cit> . disruption of l domain motifs or their function leads to defects in the final  stages of virus budding characterized by the tethering of virions to the cell surface  <cit> . most data on the role of escrt proteins and viral late domain motifs has come from research on retroviruses that primarily bud from the plasma membrane. although there are reports that ns <dig> of other flaviviruses can interact with escrt components  <cit>  there are no such reports for wnv. furthermore, it is not known whether any late domain like motifs are present in wnv structural proteins especially e protein that is essential for assembly into virus like particles  <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of conserved motifs in the wnv e protein
in case of flaviviruses, the structural e protein is necessary for virus assembly and release and the production of recombinant vlps. hence, using sequence analysis and information based on work with other viruses we undertook this study to identify the presence of conserved motifs  in the flavivirus structural e proteins and determine whether they play a role in virus assembly and release. sequence analysis of different flavivirus structural proteins and different wnv isolates revealed the presence of conserved 461pxap <dig> and 349ycyl <dig> motifs in the e protein . similar but less conserved motifs were also present in other flaviviruses like kunjin, jev and st. louis encephalitis virus  . analysis of systematically selected wnv e protein sequences suggested that the paap motif was present in about 90% of the analyzed sequences while the frequency of the psap motif was less than 10% . the ycyl motif was present in more than 95% of the wnv sequences analyzed. table  <dig>  depicts the occurrences of the pxap and ycyl motifs in the protein non-redundant database  database. as expected, sequence motifs that serve some biological functions, occur more often than by chance  <cit>  although it deserves mention that these motifs are maintained within the flavivirus e proteins that themselves are highly conserved. while sequence analysis revealed the predominance of paap motifs over psap it is unclear as to what advantage the psap motif would render in case of wnv. from studies in hiv and that of host proteins like hrs  it is well known that the psap motif is a strong binding partner of tsg <dig>  <cit> .

 <dig> , <dig> protein sequences in the non-redundant  protein database downloaded from ncbi on 1st july  <dig>  were searched for presence of the pxap and ycyl motifs. the relative abundance of each of the relevant amino acids in the nr database was used to calculate the expected occurrences of the motifs by chance.

*the expected occurrences and frequency were based on the relative abundance of each of the  <dig> amino acid residues in the nr database. the expected occurrence and frequency of pxap motif is based on the relative abundance of proline and alanine, while that of the ycyl motif is based on the relative abundance of tyrosine, cysteine and leucine in the protein nr database.

development of a rapid assay to study wnv assembly and release
we next aimed towards conducting a functional analysis to determine if wnv may utilize the above conserved motifs for virus assembly and release. to this end we developed a rapid renilla luciferase  based virus release assay and compared it to the classical radioimmunoprecipitation based assay . this would not only be a useful tool for rapid sirna based screens or to identify potential drugs/compounds that inhibit wnv particle production but also obviate the requirement for a bsl <dig> facility that is necessary for working with infectious wnv. 293t cells were transfected with cprme and wnv ren/rep plasmids  <cit> . culture supernatants were harvested  <dig> h post transfection and cells lysed and read for ren-luc activity  using the dual glo luciferase assay substrate . equal volume of the harvested supernatants were then used to infect 293t cells, cells lysed and read for luciferase activity   <dig> h post infection . virus release was calculated as ratio of virion associated ren-luc/ activity. in parallel, classical radioimmunoprecipitation based virus release assay  <cit>  was also conducted to determine the validity of the rapid assay described above . although, the luciferase based rapid assay also accounts for entry defects in virions, it is a convenient high throughput method for identification of general inhibitors of the virus life cycle.

tsg-5’ and alix-v domain expression inhibits wnv assembly and release
as mentioned above, the conserved motifs identified in the wnv envelope resembled the late domain like motifs of retroviruses. we hence asked whether some of the well characterized inhibitors of escrt pathway previously used to study retrovirus budding would affect wnv assembly and release. to inhibit tsg <dig> we utilized either tsg-5’ expression vector that prevents hiv gag-tsg <dig> interaction or tsg-f and tsg-3’ that have been shown to inhibit hiv release by globally disrupting the endosomal sorting machinery  <cit> . we also used a transdominant form of vps <dig>  that prevents the dissociation of escrt-iii components at the endosomal membrane thereby inhibiting hiv- <dig> and murine leukemia virus  budding  <cit> ,  <cit> . similarly, the v domain of alix  which is known to bind both equine infectious anemia virus  and hiv- <dig> gag acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor of virus release  <cit>  was also used. 293t cells were transfected to express cprme, wnv ren/rep plasmids in the presence of either control plasmid  or tsg-f, tsg-5’ , tsg-3’  <cit> , alix-v  <cit>  or vps4eq  <cit>  expression vectors. virus release efficiency was then calculated by both the rapid assay and classical virus release assay. interestingly, the expression of tsg-5’ and alix-v domain modestly diminished wnv release whereas no significant effect on virus release was observed on expression of tsg-3’ tsg-f or vps4eq . while it is known that expression of tsg-5’ affects hiv- <dig> release by affecting late domain function  <cit> , the precise mechanism via which tsg-3’ , tsg-f or alix-v domain affect hiv release remains unknown. they could either be affecting the function of specific host proteins or universally disrupting the cell sorting machinery utilized for wnv particle production.

mutations of the conserved paap and ycyl motifs in wnv envelope inhibits virus particle production
to further examine the relevance of these conserved pxap and ycyl motifs in wnv assembly and release, we constructed mutations in the paap residues to either laal or psap  using site directed mutagenesis. interestingly, mutation of paap to laal caused a severe defect in virus budding, while mutation of the residues to psap led to virus release efficiency that was modestly better than wt . we also mutated the ycyl domain to acya or aaaa. interestingly, mutation of the above motifs to aaaa but not acya caused a severe defect in virus release . it is worth mentioning that disruptive mutations to aaaa may also have other adverse side effects since the highly conserved cysteine residue may be involved in maintaining protein structure and stability.

it has previously been shown in context of hiv- <dig> that the paap motif interacts poorly with tsg <dig> in in-vitro binding assays using purified proteins  <cit> . since a large number of wnv isolates naturally bear a paap motif at position 461– <dig> instead of ptap, we wanted to determine if a paap motif in the hiv p <dig> would permit virus release. we hence mutated the ptap motif in hiv to paap and determined virus release. although hiv-paap was released less efficiently than wt-hiv, it was significantly better than the ptap deleted mutant . these findings, at least in case of hiv where disruption of pt/sap tsg <dig> interaction significantly affects virus release are indicative that the paap motif may still be capable of binding tsg <dig> albeit at a lower efficiency. thus a paap motif can act as a functional late domain for hiv and hence could do the same for wnv isolates that predominantly bear paap motifs. our findings are consistent with those of demirov et al.  <cit>  although the possibility that the paap motif is capable of interacting directly or indirectly with certain other host factors that favor hiv and/or wnv release cannot be ruled out.

depletion of endogenous alix or tsg <dig> does not inhibit wnv assembly and release
our findings that tsg-5’ expression inhibits wnv release suggests a role for the escrt pathway in wnv budding. however, in other enveloped viruses that bear late domains  these motifs are located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and thus would be able to interact with escrt proteins to facilitate budding and particle release. the flavivirus e protein on the other hand is translated into the lumen of the er and hence these conserved motifs in wnv e protein would only be minimally exposed to the cytoplasmic side of intracellular vesicles or the plasma membrane. hence in order to confirm the role of tsg <dig> and/or alix in wnv assembly and release we used a sirna based approach. for this 293t cells were knocked down of endogenous tsg <dig> and alix expression using specific sirnas and wnv release determined using both ren-luc based and immunoprecipitation based virus release assays. as shown in figure 5a and c, while tsg <dig> depletion had no effect on wnv particle secretion, as expected, it caused a severe reduction in hiv- <dig> release. alix depletion on the other hand had no effect on either hiv or wnv release  but diminished eiav release . thus while the conserved pxap and ycyl motifs in wnv are important for virus assembly and release, it is most likely not due to dependence on the escrt component tsg <dig> or the associated factor, alix.

in the wnv e protein, the paap motif is surface located while the ycyl motif is deeply buried
our sirna mediated depletion studies above suggested that wnv may not rely on the escrt host cell sorting machinery for assembly and release. thus, it is plausible that these motifs may interact with other host factors to facilitate the assembly of the virion particles. in fact our structural analysis shows that the pxap motif is surface accessible and could participate in protein interactions with yet unidentified cellular factors . in the context of the viral capsid made up of multiple envelope  proteins the pxap surface motif appears to form part of the interface between the envelope subunits . it also lies adjacent to the discontinuous epitope recognition site of co-crystallized neutralizing antibodies. on the other hand the ycyl motif is deeply buried and forms part of the structural core with the central cysteine participating in formation of a critical disulfide bridge . this is in agreement with our findings where mutation of the ycyl motif to acya had little effect on virus release but mutation to aaaa severely affected budding possibly via loss of the disulphide bridging cysteine.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have developed a rapid assay to study wnv assembly and release and identified conserved motifs in the viral envelope  that have functional relevance. these motifs bear sequence homology to late domain like motifs described in retroviruses. experiments aimed at elucidating their role demonstrated that while expression of tsg-5’ and alix-v domain modestly inhibited wnv particle production, expression of vps4eq had no effect on wnv release. these data combined with the fact that sirna mediated depletion of alix or tsg <dig> did not affect wnv release argues against their utilization or the escrt pathway by wnv. for instance, it has been documented that hsv possesses pt/sap and yxxl motifs in several of its proteins but virus particle production is independent of alix or tsg <dig> expression  <cit> . likewise, the psap motifs are conserved amongst the vesiculovirus m protein without possessing l domain activity  <cit> . however, the conserved nature of these domains in wnv and reduced virus release upon disruptive mutations argues in favor of a role in virus assembly via yet unidentified mechanism/s.

our data are also reminiscent of the effects of alix v domain expression versus alix depletion on hiv particle production. while sirna depletion of alix does not affect hiv release, dominant negative inhibition via alix v domain expression does  <cit> . moreover, it was recently demonstrated that the alix v domain is capable of interacting with ubiquitin  <cit> . it is also known that ubiquitination plays a role in both hiv and flavivirus particle production  <cit> . it is thus plausible that expression of the alix v domain may alter ubiquitin dependent cellular functions thereby affecting wnv particle production. the precise mechanism behind this phenomenon with respect to hiv- <dig> remains to be elucidated. the fact that some wnv strains like sarafend exhibits significant budding from the plasma membrane  <cit>  would favor a role of escrt components like alix and tsg <dig> for budding.

sequence analysis and information based on other viruses showed the presence of pxap and yxxl conserved motifs in the e protein of flaviviruses and different wnv strains, motifs that resemble the retroviral late domain-like motifs. it is worth mentioning that sequence analysis of a large portion of several different flavivirus e proteins showed only 18% conservation in the amino acid residues, although the number does reflect the maximum diversity across the whole flavivirus family  <cit> . this conservation was mostly seen on the inner surface of the monomers plausibly as a result of neutralizing antibody pressure. on the contrary, the pxap and ycyl motifs were quite conserved indicating their functional relevance. moreover, substantial changes in the consensus sequences are also found to occur in only a few areas of the e protein and may have relevance to growth in insect cells versus vertebrates  <cit> . although mutational analysis confirms the importance of these domains in wnv assembly and particle formation, the role of tsg <dig> and alix in this phenomenon remains inconclusive from this study. molecular modeling shows that the pxap domain is present on the surface of the e protein and could potentially interact with cellular factors. on the other hand the ycyl conserved domain consisted of a conserved cysteine that is involved in disulphide bonding and protein folding. although the ycyl motif may be critical in maintaining structure of the virus, the conservation of this motif and its functional relevance has neither been studied nor demonstrated in other flaviviruses. moreover, the same was not true for the pxap domain. interestingly, mutation of the paap motif to psap, which is an optimal binding partner for cellular sorting proteins modestly enhanced virus release. considering the presence of only paap and psap at positions 461– <dig> in all the wnv sequences analyzed, the importance of this domain in virus assembly cannot be ignored. while the cellular sorting partner of ps/aap domain in wnv could not be identified, our study opens the gate for further investigation into understanding wnv and flavivirus assembly in general.

further studies are needed to determine the precise mechanism via which these motifs, specially the pxap domain, regulates wnv assembly and release and whether it functions via interaction with certain host factors or merely play a structural role in regulating virus assembly and release.
