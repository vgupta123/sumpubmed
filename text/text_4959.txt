BACKGROUND
metazoans undergo morphogenetic changes, which include embryogenesis , organogenesis , regeneration , senescence , and asexual reproduction . all these changes ultimately rely on modifications of gene expression with the production of different levels of mrna for housekeeping and luxury proteins as well as regulatory non-coding rnas. therefore, variations in rna expression are of interest, since the analysis of differential gene expression can reveal mechanisms and dynamics at the basis of biological events.

tunicates are marine filter feeding organisms representing the sister group of vertebrates  <cit>  and the only chordates with species exhibiting asexual reproduction   <cit> . ascidians, the major class of tunicates, are sessile animals including both solitary and colonial species  <cit> . botryllus schlosseri is a cosmopolitan colonial ascidian, commonly found in shallow waters of temperate regions. it reproduces both sexually and asexually, and is now considered a reference chordate for the study of asexual reproduction  <cit> . it is also considered a good model to analyze: i) the relationship between embryogenesis and blastogenesis, two developmental pathways producing similar individuals  through different reproductive processes ; ii) germ cell recycling and somatic chimeras  and somatic cell clearance and turnover  <cit> ; iii) natural apoptosis occurring cyclically in the colony  <cit>  and the mechanisms underlying aging related to tissue regenerative potential and stem cell functionality  <cit> ; iv) the allorecognition phenomenon and its molecular basis  <cit> ; v) the strategies of immune defense ; vi) the potentiality of the colonial circulatory system as a model for in vivo studies of angiogenesis  <cit> . a draft of the b. schlosseri genome has been recently released  <cit>  and its ontology of anatomy and development defined  <cit> .

a colony of b. schlosseri  derives from a single tadpole-like larva, which bears a bud primordium  <cit> . the larva metamorphoses into a filtering oozooid which develops its bud primordium into an adult zooid , starting blastogenesis. a colony is formed by many blastozooids, derived by cyclical budding and grouped in star-shaped systems. usually, a colony contains three blastogenetic generations: filtering adults, buds on adults, and budlets on buds, which develop synchronously  <cit> . generation changes, or take-overs , occurs cyclically  and defines the blastogenetic cycle, i.e., the interval of time between a generation change and the next  <cit> . during the to phase, all adult zooids cease filtering and close their siphons, while their tissues undergo apoptosis and are progressively resorbed. in the meantime, regressing adults are replaced by their buds, which grow to adulthood  <cit> . the entire lifespan of a zooid, from its appearance as budlet primordium to its resorption at the to, lasts about 3 weeks at 20 °c.fig.  <dig> blastogenetic cycle of botryllus schlosseri. colonies in take-over , mid-cycle  and pre-take-over  were chosen to study differentially expressed genes. squared areas in ,  and  are enlarged in ,  and , respectively. note that three generations coexist in colonies: filtering adults, buds and budlets. drawings: branchial basket in pink in adults, pale yellow in buds and dark yellow in budlets; endostyle in orange; epidermis in violet; heart in pale pink; gut in brown. a: adult; b: bud; ba: blood ampulla; bl: budlet; bv: blood vessel; e: endostyle; g: gut; rz: regressing zooid; t: tunic



the colonial blastogenetic cycle is characterized by many morphological changes of zooids, buds and budlets, which, ultimately, imply changes in gene expression. in the attempt to put in evidence these changes, we exploited the next-generation technology of rnaseq and carried out an analysis of the colony transcriptome at various developmental phases. here, we report on the transcriptome dynamics during the blastogenetic cycle, focusing, in particular, on transcripts of genes involved in cell death by apoptosis.

fifteen cdna libraries were sequenced from three key phases  of the blastogenetic cycle: i) the mid-cycle  phase, more than one day from the preceding or following to ii) the phase immediately preceding the to , when the colony is approaching the to; and iii) the to phase, when adult zooids are resorbed and replaced by new ones. to analyze differentially expressed genes in these phases, we developed a new bioinformatic tool, in the form of a web-based platform. this platform is available at http://botryllus.cribi.unipd.it where the results of rna-seq experiments here described are stored and available for further, free gene expression analysis.

RESULTS
genome annotation enrichment
the first release of b. schlosseri genome assembly  <cit>  contains  <dig> chromosomes and one scaffold that incorporates all contigs not associated with chromosomes . the authors estimated that the b. schlosseri genome contains roughly  <dig>  genes.

we enriched the genome annotation using specific transcripts of mc, pre-to, and to transcriptomes as described in the methods section. two approaches were followed  <cit> . in the first one, the rna-seq reads were directly assembled to produce a de novo transcriptome assembly  using the program satrap  <cit>  . in the second approach, “align then assemble” or “genomic approach” , the color-space reads were mapped onto the b. schlosseri reference genome using the program pass  <cit> .fig.  <dig> genome annotation enrichment. a  the rna-seq data referred to mc, pre-to and to were cleaned for the presence of contaminants  and then  assembled and color translated using the program satrap. the resulted assemblies  contain also the transcripts that did not map in the reference genome because of the lacking of genome information. b the mapping information of mc, pre-to and to phases  as well as the genome annotation data  were passed to the program cufflinks . the parsimonious dataset of transcripts produced by the program cufflinks and the assembling information of each considered developmental phase   were analyzed by the program pasa  to produce a new gene prediction consistent with the reference genome sequence . unmapped contigs  were reconsidered for further analysis



by considering the regions covered by rna-seq reads, we were able to update the prediction of most genes of the voskoboynik’s gene prediction. taking into consideration that some genes showed alternative splicing isoforms,  <dig>  transcripts were updated. newly predicted transcripts, absent in the old annotation, amounted to  <dig> ;  <dig>  of these resulted coding genes, while the remaining seem to be transcribed into non-coding rnas. results obtained from the gene prediction analysis are shown in fig. 3a and further information are included in the additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> gene prediction statistics. statistics inferred using the mapped transcripts are shown in , while statistics inferred using the unmapped contigs are evidenced in . the light green areas indicates the reliable transcripts selected as result of this analysis. b the areas  and  represent the updated and unmodified gene predictions referred to the genome annotation data. the new gene prediction stressed in  can be classified into coding genes  and unreliable information such as long non-coding genes and partial utrs . about  <dig>  % of coding genes  consisting of  and  were significantly similar to a sequence stored into the non-redundant database; while a percentage of  <dig>  % of  consisting of  and  had significant long orf predictions.  represents the number of unreliable coding genes discarded, while , , ,  and  represent the gene predictions considered in the gene expression analysis. b the area  represents the number of transcripts  that mapped less than 10 % of their sequence length onto the reference genome.   <dig> out of  <dig> transcripts evidenced a significant coding potential,   <dig> transcripts had orfs open at 5′-end;   <dig> transcripts resulted in orfs open at both ends;   <dig> transcripts resulted in orfs open at 3′-end, and   <dig> resulted complete orfs



unreliable transcripts, not consistent with the genome sequence were discarded, but those resulting entirely unmapped  were reconsidered for further investigations .

the assembled transcripts with an open reading frame  that had a significant coding potential were  <dig>  out of  <dig> mentioned above  <cit> . more precisely,  <dig> transcripts were resolved as complete orfs,  <dig> transcripts were resolved as orfs open at 5′-end,  <dig> transcripts were resolved as orfs open at 3′-end, and  <dig> transcripts resulted in orfs open at both ends. the complete orfs were analyzed to minimize the inclusion of putative chimeric assemblies and quantifying the presence of contaminants. to accomplish this purpose the  <dig> complete orfs were translated in silico into amino acid sequences and then aligned onto the non-redundant protein sequence database using the program blastp  <cit> . the same orfs were also aligned onto the nt database  using the tblastn program  <cit> . all mapped transcripts were classified according to the taxonomy inherited by similar and significant alignments  that is also reported in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> taxonomic analysis of  <dig> orfs. this graph represents the proportion of unmapped transcripts that have inherited the taxonomic classification by similar and significant proteins . as expected, the taxon of ascidiacea resulted the more represented one

proportion of unmapped transcripts, which inherited the taxonomic classification by similar and significant alignments, resulted from blastp and tblastn mapping onto non redundant sequence database  and partially non redundant nucleotide database . the e-value was set to 10- <dig>  whereas the percentage of sequence identity was set to the default value. as expected, the taxon of ascidiacea resulted the most represented



as expected, the class ascidiacea is the most represented, including about 74 % of the transcripts. the finding that some orfs have their most similar counterpart in organisms different from ascidiacea, is of interest and raises the possibility that they could be contaminants from coexisting organisms. although we cannot exclude that some of these sequences may be contaminants, it should be considered that the b. schlosseri colonies were grown in the laboratory under controlled feeding conditions. furthermore, it is noticeable that more than 15 % of the non-ascidiacea sequences belong to other chordate vertebrates, and in particular to mammals, which are much better known at the genomic level. on the basis of these considerations, the  <dig> transcripts were added to those obtained from the gene prediction analysis and the entire dataset was analyzed in the gene annotation process.

all transcripts were annotated using the blast2go annotation procedure  <cit> . updated and new gene predictions were considered as two different datasets and fig.  <dig> shows some results of statistical analyses. the majority of annotations come from the uniprot knowledgebase database source . a consistent fraction of ips  found for both datasets resulted associated with gene ontology  terms . the total number of annotations, referred to updated gene predictions, was  <dig>  while  <dig>  annotations were associated with new gene predictions. the mean go-level resulted  <dig>  and  <dig>  for both analyses .fig.  <dig> blast2go gene annotation. the transcripts resulted from both genomic and assembling approaches  allowed updating the old gene predictions  and producing new gene predictions . figures a <dig> and b <dig> show the statistics referred to the number of gos per database source as results of the blast similarity searching. figures a <dig> and b <dig> show the number of sequences containing interproscan  and gos given after the integration of data coming from the ips analysis. figures a <dig> and b <dig> show the go-level distribution, respectively for biological processes , molecular functions  and cellular components 



a web interface for comparative analysis of b. schlosseri transcriptomes
a web-based platform was developed to investigate gene regulation in the considered blastogenetic phases. the system includes several programs, mainly devoted to the comparative analysis of transcriptomes, and a web-based interface, which allows intersecting all the information resulting from specific queries. both queries and statistical functions make possible an overview of the genetic changes under different developmental stages. genes grouped into go categories were compared to highlight the changes in transcription and focus the main information. the web-based platform and all scientific data are available without restrictions at web site http://botryllus.cribi.unipd.it/.

the blastogenetic cycle: an overview of genetic changes
a statistical analysis was performed according to the method proposed by wang and collaborators  <cit> . mainly, it integrates the fisher’s exact test  <cit>  and the likelihood ratio test  <cit> . we considered the following comparisons: pre-to vs mc; to vs pre-to, and mc vs to. significant differentially expressed genes obtained from each analysis were classified within the go definitions and each category was compared with those coming from other analyses. in order to evaluate the differences in terms of gene number and differential expression, genes belonging to the same go definition were compared quantitatively. those more represented, in terms of gene number, related to the ontology domain molecular functions and are reported in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> overview of the differentially expressed genes grouped into the go domain molecular functions. differentially expressed genes obtained from each couple of analyzed conditions were grouped into go definitions  and then compared to analyze the differences of the most represented ones. in the comparison mc vs to, the functional definitions microtubule motor activity and atpase activity resulted strongly reduced in the total number of involved genes as evidenced by the thin slices in yellow and green. the percentage of genes resulted up or down-regulated  for a specific go definition is indicated nearby to each slice



while the number of differentially expressed genes included in the go definitions calcium ion binding, protein binding, atp binding and zinc ion binding resulted almost similar in all the compared conditions, a consistent number of differentially expressed genes included in the microtubule motor activity and atpase activity drastically decreased when comparing mc with to. as shown in fig.  <dig>  these genes changed their expression also when comparing pre-to with mc and to with pre-to, and related genes involved in myosin and dynein complex formation showed the same behavior . precisely,  <dig> genes involved in myosin-, dynein- and axonemal dynein-complexes appeared under-expressed in the pre-to compared with mc, while  <dig> genes resulted over-expressed in the to phase. in agreement with this evidence, the majority of genes involved in the atpase activity showed similar behavior. these data fit the hypothesis that the atp/adp hydrolysis is essential for the microtubule activity required for the resorption of the adult zooids, the growth of the buds to adulthood and to complete the morphogenesis of budlets which become buds.table  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved in microtubule motor activity


list of the go definitions related to microtubule motor activity and atpase activity for each couple of analyzed conditions



motor proteins, exploiting the cytoskeleton for movement, can be classified on the basis of their substrates. actin motors, such as myosin, move along microfilaments through interaction with actin, whereas microtubule motors, such as dynein and kinesin, move along microtubules through interaction with tubulin. our evidence indicates that only a few genes, involved in the formation of myosin complexes, changed their expression during the blastogenetic cycle. conversely, a high number of differentially expressed genes were involved in dynein complexes and microtubule formation, as stressed in table  <dig>  this evidence suggests that the dynein-based tubulin motors are important in the progression of the blastogenetic cycle, especially when to is approaching.

as reported in fig.  <dig>  the analyses of genes involved in biological processes gave results very similar to those described in fig.  <dig>  results concerning the go definitions atp catabolic process and microtubule-based movement are similar to the previously described data on microtubule motor activity and atpase activity, for both number of genes and regulation trend .fig.  <dig> overview of the differentially expressed genes grouped into the go category biological processes. differentially expressed genes obtained from each couple of considered conditions were grouped into go definitions  and then compared to analyze the differences of the most represented ones. in the comparison mc vs to, the biological processes atp catabolic process and microtubule-based movement resulted strongly reduced in the total number of involved genes as evidenced by the thin slices in green and pink. the same behavior was found for ribosome biogenesis evidenced by the thin slices in blue in the comparison to vs pre-to. the percentage of genes up- or down-regulated  for a specific go definition is indicated nearby to each slice


list of the go definitions that are more represented for at least one couple of analyzed conditions



the number of differentially expressed genes involved in ribosome biogenesis increased drastically in the comparison of pre-to with mc . the other two comparisons  showed that the majority of the differentially expressed genes resulted down-regulated. this supports the hypothesis that the ribosome biogenesis is mainly associated with the final phases of the blastogenetic cycle, probably because of an increased translational activity related to bud growth or the appearance of a new bud generation.

proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins into small peptides or amino acids. proteolysis serves many purposes: i) breakdown of proteins providing amino acids for basal metabolism and development; ii) cleavage of polypeptide chains for the activation the protein itself; 3) regulation of some physiological and cellular processes and prevention of the accumulation of unwanted or altered proteins inside cells.

the number of differentially expressed genes involved in proteolysis resulted high in the comparisons to vs pre-to and mc vs to, but decreased in the comparison pre-to vs mc . a detailed summary of the expression of genes involved in proteolysis is shown in table  <dig>  the majority of the observed proteolytic activities is ascribable to serine-type peptidases  i.e., enzymes cleaving peptide bonds carrying a serine as the nucleophilic amino acid at the active site of the enzyme  <cit> . in humans, they coordinate various physiological functions, including digestion, immune response, blood coagulation and reproduction  <cit> . more than  <dig> serine protease genes resulted activated after the to. however, the low presence of differentially expressed genes and the high number of read counts in the comparison of pre-to vs mc suggests that there were no changes in the regulation of these enzymes during this developmental transition.table  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved into proteolysis


list of the go definitions related to proteolysis for each couple of analyzed conditions



cysteine-based proteases play important roles in every aspect of physiology and development. in humans and other animals, they are responsible for pro-hormone processing, mhc ii-related immune responses, extracellular matrix remodeling, senescence and apoptosis  <cit> . interestingly, the cysteine type peptidase activity is higher during pre-to and to and inhibited in the mc . this fact suggests that the cysteine-type proteases probably contribute to the recycling process of regressing zooids during the generation change.

our results indicate that, for most of the transcripts, there is no evidence of differential expression . however, transcription factor six1/ <dig>  adult muscle-type actin ma <dig> and cadherin cdh, resulted differentially expressed. cdh transcript was down-regulated at the mc with respect to the to, and up-regulated in the pre-to with respect to the mc. no differences in the expression level of the ma <dig> and six1/ <dig> transcripts were observed when mc and the pre-to, as well as the pre-to and the to were compared; however, the two genes were differentially expressed when the to and the mc were compared. the unexpected result regarding ma <dig> and six1/ <dig>  can be explained considering that in this work we focused on three defined phases of blastogenesis. we hypothesize that their expression level is balanced in a blastogenetic phase not considered here.

unlike six1/ <dig>  the transcription factor eya did not result differentially expressed. considering that the eya protein is a cofactor of the six protein  <cit> , and that previous ish experiments had shown a comparable spatio-temporal pattern of the two transcripts during blastogenesis  <cit> , we explain this discrepancy considering the multiple roles of the two proteins  <cit>  which might be independently regulated in their gene expressions.

ca <dig> was not differentially expressed in the three blastogenetic phases. this stable expression level confirms the goodness of the choice of cytoplasmic actin as reference gene for quantitative pcr  experiments.

relative rt-pcr validation
in order to validate the differential expression for some transcripts, we performed experiments of relative rt-pcr  on inhibitor of apoptosis , apoptosis inducing factor , glutathione peroxidase  <dig> , and pax <dig> transcripts. the level of transcripts for iap significantly increased during to with respect to pre-to, and during pre-to with respect to mc. conversely, it decreased in mc with respect to to. the level of transcripts for aif increased in to with respect to pre-to. the level of transcripts for gpx <dig> and pax <dig> decreased and increased, respectively, in mc with respect to to. all the results are in agreement with the web interface analyses .fig.  <dig> relative expression levels of iap, aif, gpx <dig> and pax <dig> in different phases of the blastogenetic cycle. each bar of the histogram corresponds to the average of three independent experiments ± sd. significant differences, with respect to control , are marked by asterisks. ***p <  <dig> 



search for differentially expressed genes in b. schlosseri: the case of apoptosis-related genes
b. schlosseri is a useful model organism for studying apoptosis. it offers the advantage of a natural, massive induction of apoptosis during its cyclic generation changes without any external manipulation or drug administration  <cit> . the diffuse cell death is concentrated in tissues of adult zooids. at the same time, cell proliferation occurs in buds and budlets which grow to adult and bud size, respectively, and in hematopoietic niches to produce new hemocytes entering the circulation and replacing effete circulating cells  <cit> .

among the differentially expressed transcripts we selected those included in apoptosis-related categories . we identified  <dig> genes that play a role in apoptosis of b. schlosseri. six genes are involved in the apoptosis activation and seven in its inhibition; seven genes take part in apoptosis regulation; the remaining four genes are in relation to apoptosis with other roles, and are not discussed in detail here.table  <dig> apoptosis-related genes obtained comparing transcriptomes

genes involved in apoptosis activation
in agreement with previous results  <cit> , our data showed that pre-to and to are the phases in which major variations of apoptosis-related genes are observable. our analysis evidenced the following differentially expressed genes: camp-gmp phosphodiesterase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , apoptosis inducing factor , caspase  <dig>  insulin receptor  and o-methylguanine-induced apoptosis  <dig> .

the over-expression, in pre-to, of camp-gmp phosphodiesterase indicates that camp-mediated signaling pathways are involved in the induction of apoptosis. gapdh influences the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial membrane permeabilization  <cit> . its transcript is under-expressed in pre-to with respect to mc, probably related to a slow activation of the mitochondrial induction pathway. this fits the observed decrease, passing from mc to pre-to, of the expression of aif, a mitochondrial protein responsible for mediating cell death independently from caspases  <cit> ; aif then increases its expression at to.

caspase  <dig> is an effector caspase able to induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria  <cit>  and its over-expression in pre-to with respect to mc, indicates that mitochondria–related apoptosis really starts at pre-to.

results on ir and mapo <dig> were unexpected. ir over-expression at pre-to fits the recent description of ir as a dependence receptor  <cit> . ir mediates apoptosis promoting, by unknown mechanisms, bax- and caspase 3-mediated cell death  <cit> . mapo <dig> is one of the most important proteins involved in the execution of apoptosis induced by o6-methylguanine  <cit> . it is activated by mutagenic insults that lead to the formation of o6-methylguanine, when the specific repair protein, o6-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase  fails to transfer the methyl group from o6-methylguanine to a methyl-acceptor cysteine residue  <cit> . our results, indicating an over-expression of mapo <dig> during the to, suggest that dna alkylation is important in the activation of b. schlosseri natural apoptosis.

genes involved in apoptosis inhibition
the following genes resulted differentially expressed: apoptosis inhibitor  <dig> , homeodomain protein six, polo-like kinase  <dig> , ubiquilin- <dig>  epidermal grow factor receptor , γ-glutamyl-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit  and inhibitor of apoptosis .

api <dig> and the homeodomain protein six are over-expressed in mc with respect to to, in accordance with previous data indicating lower amount of cell death far from the generation change  <cit> . api <dig> and the homeodomain protein six act in a similar way, trough the inactivation of pro-apoptotic protein such as caspases .

plk <dig> is able to bind p <dig>  inhibiting its negative functions on cell cycle  <cit> . plk <dig> over-expression at pre-to is probably related to the cell proliferation required for bud to grow to adult size before acquiring functional maturity  <cit> . ubiquilin- <dig> is under-expressed at to. in mammals, ubiquitin- <dig> has the capability to suppress neuronal cell death  <cit> ; it could play a similar role in b. schlosseri, allowing neuronal cell death in regressing zooids. egfr activates the ras-mapk pathway and modulates the induction of apoptosis  <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster, the down-regulation of an egfr/ras/raf signaling pathway is required for apoptosis  <cit> . our data, indicating a reduced transcription of the gene at pre-to, suggest a similar role of egfr in b. schlosseri.

gclc is a key enzyme in the synthesis of gsh, which is produced, in ascidians, by a subpopulation of hemocytes  <cit> . gclc over-expression prevents cell damage and death by oxidative stress. its under-expression at pre-to strengthens the proposed role of ros in the induction of apoptosis at to  <cit> . iap is a negative regulator of caspase activity  <cit> . its over-expression at pre-to and to can be related to the need to suppress apoptosis before the beginning of a new blastogenetic cycle. the gene expression is switched off in the following mc.

genes involved in apoptosis regulation
seven genes, important for the regulation of cell death, resulted differentially expressed. they were: template-activating factor  <dig> , o-n-acetylglucosamine transferase , splicing factor 3b, scribble, dynein light chain  <dig>  cullin- <dig> and cystationine ß-synthase.

set is a multifunctional protein that exerts a negative regulation of apoptosis induction in mammalian neurons  <cit> . the increase of set transcription at mc is in accordance with this role.

it is well known that post-translational modifications are important for the modulation of biological events  <cit> . johnson and collaborators  <cit>  stressed the role of transfer of o-linked n-acetylglucosamine residues to serines and/or threonines in the regulation of apoptosis. the variation in transcription of the gene for ogt suggests that, also in b. schlosseri, the enzyme contributes to the regulation of cell death. even post transcriptional modifications seem to be important in b. schlosseri apoptosis, as indicated by the changes of splicing factor 3b. its over-expression at mc suggests a role of splicing events, similarly to what reported by laetsch and collaborators  <cit>  in neuroblastoma, in the regulation of the blastogenetic cycle.

it has been shown that deregulation of the polarity protein scribble is involved in the modulation of cell death pathways, in both normal morphogenesis and oncogenesis, acting as a scaffold protein for the activation of rac signaling pathway  <cit> . the over-expression, in mc, of a scribble homolog suggests the presence of a similar regulation also in b. schlosseri.

dynein light chain  <dig> is implicated in the regulation of germ cell apoptosis in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . our data indicate a variation of the expression of dynein light chain  <dig> gene and point to its involvement in b. schlosseri cell death.

in mammals, cullin- <dig> is involved in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis  <cit>  whereas cystationine ß-synthase regulates lps-induced apoptosis in hepatic cells  <cit> . homologous genes for cullin- <dig> and cystationine ß-synthase are present in our transcriptomes and the variation of their transcription supports the hypothesis of their involvement in apoptosis regulation during the b. schlosseri blastogenetic cycle.

CONCLUSIONS
the blastogenetic cycle of b. schlosseri is a fascinating process, which re-starts every week under laboratory conditions, allowing the cyclical rejuvenation of the colonies and giving the organism a potential never-ending life. in fact, in this animal, birth, development and regression of zooids are continuous, for the contemporary presence, in the colony, of the three blastogenetic generations.

the results reported in this paper contribute to the improvement of the annotation of the first released genome assembly  <cit> .

moreover, the analyses of differentially expressed genes in the chosen phases of the blastogenetic cycle give an overview of the transcriptional changes occurring during blastogenesis. recently, a complementary work has been performed  <cit> , where differential expression was investigated comparing fertile and infertile colonies. both studies paves the way to further investigations of biological processes such as growth and regression, cell proliferation, colony homeostasis, and competition among different generations in the colony.

the case of apoptosis, which we chose as an example, showed candidate genes involved in activation, inhibition and regulation of cell death in specific phases of the blastogenetic cycle. many of these genes were not investigated previously in b. schlosseri. their study will allow a better comprehension of the role and the importance of apoptosis in colony homeostasis.
