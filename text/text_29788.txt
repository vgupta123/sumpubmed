BACKGROUND
pelobacter carbinolicus is a bacterial species isolated from anoxic mud by anaerobic enrichment on the growth substrate  <dig> -butanediol, an end product of fermentations
 <cit> . p. carbinolicus was assigned to the genus pelobacter of the deltaproteobacteria on the basis of its ability to consume fermentatively alcohols such as  <dig> -butanediol, acetoin and ethanol, but not sugars, with acetate plus ethanol and/or hydrogen as the end products
 <cit> . subsequently, pelobacter species, which cannot oxidize acetate, were shown to be phylogenetically distributed throughout the order desulfuromonadales <cit> , among species that grow by oxidation of acetate with either s° or fe but not sulfate as the electron acceptor. p. carbinolicus belongs to the family desulfuromonadaceae <cit>  and pelobacter propionicus to geobacteraceae. the complete genome sequence of p. carbinolicus has led to the discoveries that it expresses c-type cytochromes
 <cit>  and that it utilizes fe as a terminal electron acceptor indirectly via reduction of s°
 <cit> . in silico metabolic models have been constructed for p. carbinolicus and p. propionicus <cit> , their genomes have been compared to those of acetate-oxidizing, non-fermentative geobacteraceae <cit> , and a shortage of histidyl-trna caused by the crispr locus has been proposed to account for the loss of some ancestral genes such as multiheme c-type cytochromes by the p. carbinolicus genome
 <cit> . however, there are many features of the p. carbinolicus genome that these studies have not addressed. the aim of this paper is to present these features as they pertain to current assumptions and questions about the physiology and metabolism of p. carbinolicus, from substrate uptake to enzymology to electron transfer processes and outer surface features.

RESULTS
contents of the p. carbinolicus genome
the genome of p. carbinolicus was sequenced and the annotation was curated as detailed in the methods section. the previous annotation consists of  <dig> orfs,  <dig> pseudogenes, and  <dig> structural rna genes. during curation,  <dig> false orfs and one pseudogene were removed, five pseudogenes were reclassified as orfs and one orf as a pseudogene,  <dig> orfs and  <dig> pseudogenes were added, one trna gene was reclassified as a mutant trna gene, and  <dig> nucleotide sequence features including riboswitches, crispr spacers and multicopy sequences were identified. the current annotation consists of  <dig> orfs,  <dig> pseudogenes,  <dig> structural rnas and  <dig> other nucleotide sequence features. the locations of multicopy nucleotide sequences of the p. carbinolicus genome relative to genes, their coordinates and their alignments can be found in the supplementary material .

the mutant trna
the trna gene that had to be reclassified, pcar_r <dig>  was originally annotated as specific for leucine, but its sequence does not align with the six true trna-leu genes of p. carbinolicus ; it aligns with trna-asn  except that the asparagine anticodon guu has mutated to a leucine anticodon cag and a deletion of seven bases has buried the aminoacylation site  within the acceptor stem. the deletion is expected to interfere with 3′ end trimming and aminoacylation of the mutant trna and prevent the mistranslation of cug leucine codons as asparagine. another indication that pcar_r <dig> may not function in protein translation is that the universally conserved frameshift control base u <dig> has mutated to a. mutations at other positions in pcar_r <dig> are reciprocal , indicating that the mutant trna may be under selective pressure to maintain the cloverleaf fold  for some function; it is not a pseudogene.

the location of pcar_r <dig> suggests a function in rna repair or editing . on its 3′ side, three genes transcribed in the same direction encode a stomatin-like multimeric membrane protein , an rna 3′-phosphate cyclase 
 <cit>  and an rna 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate--5′-hydroxyl ligase 
 <cit> . on the 5′ side of pcar_r <dig>  transcribed divergently, is the transcriptional regulator of rtcab 
 <cit> . accordingly, the mutant trna may be either a substrate or a guide for the rna-active enzymes. another rna 3′-phosphate cyclase  and rna-binding protein  may also participate.

asparagine metabolism
the mutant trna might also have a role in the synthesis of asparagine, for which no asparagine synthetase was identified in p. carbinolicus <cit> . p. carbinolicus is predicted to convert oxaloacetate to aspartate using both a nonspecific aminotransferase found in geobacteraceae  and an aspartate-specific aminotransferase  with 30% sequence identity to that of thermus thermophilus <cit> . in t. thermophilus, which lacks asparagine synthetase and asparaginyl-trna synthetase, aspartate is attached to trna-asn by a non-discriminating aspartyl-trna synthetase
 <cit> , then corrected to asparaginyl-trna by the amidotransferase system . in contrast, p. carbinolicus possesses an asparaginyl-trna synthetase  and a discriminating aspartyl-trna synthetase  similar to those of geobacteraceae, but no non-discriminating aspartyl-trna synthetase. therefore, either p. carbinolicus possesses an unidentified novel asparagine synthetase or its asparaginyl-trna synthetase can be modulated to accommodate aspartate in lieu of asparagine, with subsequent correction by the amidotransferase system. in the latter case, the role of the trna-asn-derived mutant trna might be to modulate the asparaginyl-trna synthetase homodimer by binding to one subunit in a manner that allows the other subunit to react trna-asn with aspartate.

if asparaginyl-trna synthesis is difficult in p. carbinolicus, one would expect the p. carbinolicus genome to encode fewer proteins with numerous closely spaced asparagine residues than the genomes of other desulfuromonadales. a similar expectation for a histidyl-trna synthesis defect was previously validated
 <cit> . when the total number of asparagine residues and the asparagine demand index  were computed for every protein in p. carbinolicus and other desulfuromonadales, the resulting patterns showed that proteins with numerous and closely spaced asparagine residues are in fact fewer in p. carbinolicus , as if asparaginyl-trna is limiting.

three  <dig> -butanediol dehydrogenases
the following seven sections will focus on different growth substrates. the initial description of p. carbinolicus established that it consumes all three stereoisomers of  <dig> -butanediol
 <cit> , whereas many other species are limited by the stereospecificities of their  <dig> -butanediol dehydrogenases
 <cit> . mdr family dehydrogenases that act on -chiral hydroxyl groups interconvert - <dig> -butanediol with -acetoin and/or meso- <dig> -butanediol with -acetoin, while sdr family dehydrogenases that act on -chiral hydroxyl groups interconvert - <dig> -butanediol with -acetoin and/or meso- <dig> -butanediol with -acetoin. genome sequencing of p. carbinolicus revealed three  <dig> -butanediol dehydrogenases , but the published studies have either noted only one
 <cit>  or assigned them to only two stereoisomers
 <cit> . the correct assignment of all three enzymes to their substrates could have commercial value for the production of optically pure  <dig> -butanediol
 <cit> . the budx protein has 39% sequence identity to enzymes of paenibacillus polymyxa <cit>  and bacillus subtilis <cit>  that have higher activity with - <dig> -butanediol than with meso- <dig> -butanediol. budy and budz are most closely related to each other, and 40-47% identical to meso- <dig> -butanediol dehydrogenase of klebsiella pneumoniae <cit>  and - <dig> -butanediol dehydrogenase of corynebacterium glutamicum <cit> . the active site of the c. glutamicum enzyme excludes meso- <dig> -butanediol and is formed by eleven amino acid residues
 <cit> , all of which are conserved in budy. two of these residues are different in the k. pneumoniae enzyme that excludes - <dig> -butanediol
 <cit> , and two residues are different in budz . therefore, budy may be tentatively annotated as - <dig> -butanediol dehydrogenase and budz as meso- <dig> -butanediol dehydrogenase, assignments that will have to be validated experimentally. p. carbinolicus does not grow on - <dig> -butanediol alone as it does with the other stereoisomers , suggesting that budy may not be expressed constitutively and budz may have a strong preference for meso- <dig> -butanediol.

mutations that could alter the substrate specificity from - <dig> -butanediol to meso- <dig> -butanediol are indicated in italics.

expression of budx and budz is upregulated during growth of p. carbinolicus on racemic acetoin compared to growth on ethanol
 <cit> . this may mean that the two enzymes act in concert to interconvert the stereoisomers of acetoin through meso- <dig> -butanediol. the stereospecificity of acetoin dehydrogenase has not been determined experimentally, but neisseria winogradskyi and micrococcus ureae oxidize meso- <dig> -butanediol through -acetoin only
 <cit> . if acetoin dehydrogenase prefers -acetoin, p. carbinolicus could use first budz to reduce the carbonyl group of -acetoin to an -chiral hydroxyl group in meso- <dig> -butanediol, then budx to oxidize the -chiral hydroxyl group to a carbonyl group in -acetoin. strains of p. carbinolicus growing on acetoin transiently accumulate meso- <dig> -butanediol to a lesser extent than optically active  <dig> -butanediol
 <cit> , consistent with conversion of -acetoin via meso- <dig> -butanediol to -acetoin for degradation while - <dig> -butanediol serves as an electron sink. expression of budy does not change during growth on racemic acetoin
 <cit> , consistent with the prediction that budy has no activity on meso- <dig> -butanediol. the pcar_ <dig> gene on the 3′ side of budz, encoding an sdr family oxidoreductase, is also upregulated on acetoin and should be investigated for a possible role in acetoin/ <dig> -butanediol metabolism.

the acetoin dehydrogenase gene cluster
genome sequencing revealed that the previously sequenced acetoin dehydrogenase genes acoabcsl of p. carbinolicus <cit>  are within a cluster of  <dig> genes  mostly upregulated during growth on acetoin and all transcribed in the same direction
 <cit> . the third gene of this cluster is budx  and the seventh gene  encodes a small protein similar to the c-termini of budy and budz , which might function as a modulator of  <dig> -butanediol metabolism. the pcar_ <dig> gene on the 5′ side of budx encodes a multitransmembrane protein that might facilitate transport of acetoin and  <dig> -butanediol across the inner membrane, and pcar_ <dig>  the eighth gene of the cluster, encodes a possible modulator of transport, a protein of the duf <dig> family distantly related to the glnk protein that controls the ammonium transport channel. five genes of the cluster  encode a partial set of enzymes for biosynthesis of thiamin, a cofactor of acetoin dehydrogenase; amidst them is the acox gene of unknown function  that is typical of acetoin dehydrogenase gene clusters. the p. carbinolicus genome possesses seemingly redundant genes for each thiamin biosynthesis enzyme , and most are quite divergent in sequence from their homologs in geobacteraceae, while thih has not been identified in any geobacteraceae genome. p. carbinolicus has only one source of lipoate, the other cofactor of acetoin dehydrogenase: the lipb  gene product transfers an octanoyl group from an acyl carrier protein to the enzyme and then the acos  gene product converts it to a dihydrolipoyl group. p. carbinolicus lacks the lpla gene of geobacteraceae to attach free octanoate or dihydrolipoate to enzymes, and although their lipb gene product sequences align well, acos is very different in sequence from its counterpart in geobacteraceae, lipa. altogether, the ancillary enzymes of acetoin dehydrogenase appear to be a mosaic of genes of various origins.

acor, the activator of acetoin dehydrogenase gene expression
 <cit> , has three counterparts in p. carbinolicus encoded by acor <dig>  in the acetoin dehydrogenase gene cluster, acor <dig>  next to budy, and acor <dig>  next to a gene encoding an oxidoreductase of the aldo/keto reductase family  that should be investigated for a possible function in acetoin/ <dig> -butanediol metabolism. the three acor proteins share 52-73% sequence identity. their multiplicity suggests that control of acetoin/ <dig> -butanediol metabolism in p. carbinolicus may be more complex than in other species. indeed, our unpublished microarray data for p. carbinolicus growing by disproportionation of  <dig> -butanediol to ethanol plus acetate indicate  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold upregulation of acor <dig> and acor <dig>  respectively, compared to growth by oxidation of  <dig> -butanediol to acetate, and  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold upregulation, respectively, compared to growth by oxidation of ethanol to acetate. none of the three acor genes changes expression during growth on acetoin.

other gene products of the cluster  are predicted to act on acyl-coa substrates , which is surprising because there is not a single acyl-coa dehydrogenase, enoyl-coa hydratase, or thiolase gene in p. carbinolicus. these enzymes might degrade a byproduct of acetoin dehydrogenase formed by accidental aldol addition of acetyl-coa to acetaldehyde . consistent with this prediction, acetate is a minor product when p. carbinolicus oxidizes  <dig> -butanediol to 3-hydroxybutanoate
 <cit> .

metabolism of glycerol and  <dig> -propanediol
p. carbinolicus was initially described as unable to degrade glycerol
 <cit> , but some strains in pure culture disproportionate glycerol to  <dig> -propanediol plus 3-hydroxypropanoate with acetate as a carbon source
 <cit>  and the type strain utilizes glycerol with geobacter sulfurreducens as a syntrophic partner . therefore, an attempt was made to delineate the pathway of glycerol metabolism in p. carbinolicus based on its genome . the glycerol dehydratase  and activating enzyme  of p. carbinolicus are 57% and 38% identical to characterized homologs in clostridium butyricum <cit> , respectively. the c. butyricum enzyme dehydrates both glycerol to 3-hydroxypropanal and  <dig> -propanediol to propanal, consistent with utilization of  <dig> -propanediol by a p. carbinolicus strain
 <cit> . oxidation of 3-hydroxypropanal to 3-hydroxypropanoate may yield one atp if 3-hydroxypropanoyl-coa is an intermediate. p. carbinolicus possesses multiple predicted isozymes of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase , phosphate acetyltransferase  and acetate kinase  that could nonspecifically catalyze these reactions. the final atp-yielding step might also be catalyzed by propanoate kinase  or butanoate kinase . to oxidize 3-hydroxypropanoate to 3-oxopropanoate, a candidate alcohol dehydrogenase  is encoded next to the gene for the next enzyme, a decarboxylating 3-oxopropanoate/2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate dehydrogenase  with 41% sequence identity to that of b. subtilis <cit> . this step produces acetyl-coa, which yields one atp upon conversion to acetate. of the predicted energy yield of two atp per glycerol molecule in syntrophic culture, a part must be expended to convert three nadh to hydrogen/formate molecules, which g. sulfurreducens consumes along with acetate.

p. carbinolicus possesses a  <dig> -propanediol dehydrogenase  that is 66% identical to the characterized k. pneumoniae enzyme
 <cit> . thus, the machinery may be present for p. carbinolicus in pure culture to derive two atp from fermentation of four glycerol molecules to three molecules of  <dig> -propanediol and one of acetate . p. carbinolicus in syntrophic culture may also oxidize  <dig> -propanediol to yield two atp, part of which it must expend to convert four nadh to four hydrogen/formate molecules to transfer to a syntrophic partner
 <cit> . nearby the 3-oxopropanoate dehydrogenase gene are genes for a hydrogenase  and an nadph oxidoreductase subunit  similar to sfrb of geobacteraceae <cit>  that together may dispose of electrons from glycerol and  <dig> -propanediol.

the glycerol dehydratase gene cluster and the  <dig> -propanediol dehydrogenase gene cluster share several notable features . the pcar_ <dig> gene on the 5′ side of the glycerol dehydratase genes and the pcar_ <dig> gene on the 3′ side of the  <dig> -propanediol dehydrogenase gene encode multitransmembrane proteins that share 47-54% sequence identity with the predicted acetoin/ <dig> -butanediol channel . these two proteins may facilitate diffusion of glycerol and  <dig> -propanediol, respectively. the pcar_ <dig> gene encodes a duf <dig> family protein that may modulate one or both channels. three outer membrane proteins sharing 49-56% sequence identity are encoded by pcar_ <dig> on the 3′ side of the glycerol dehydratase genes, by pcar_ <dig>  which is transcribed divergently from the  <dig> -propanediol dehydrogenase gene, and by pcar_ <dig>  they may facilitate diffusion across the outer membrane for glycerol,  <dig> -propanediol, and acetoin/ <dig> -butanediol, respectively. yet another triad of paralogous genes  linked to these gene clusters encodes radical sam domain oxidoreductases whose substrates are unknown.

metabolism of  <dig> -ethanediol
p. carbinolicus can grow by disproportionation of  <dig> -ethanediol to ethanol plus acetate
 <cit> , yielding  <dig>  atp . however, its genome does not encode a three-subunit adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase
 <cit>  to convert  <dig> -ethanediol to acetaldehyde. the  <dig> -ethanediol dehydratase of p. carbinolicus strains seems to be more oxygen-sensitive
 <cit> ; it may be a glycyl radical enzyme encoded by pcar_ <dig> , and pcar_ <dig>  may encode its activating enzyme. the intervening genes are of uncertain relevance to  <dig> -ethanediol metabolism . the reactions of glycerol and  <dig> -ethanediol metabolism are missing from the published metabolic model of p. carbinolicus <cit> , which attributes a pyruvate formate-lyase function to both dehydratases on the basis of similarity to an escherichia coli protein for which such a function could not be substantiated
 <cit> . experimental validation of  <dig> -ethanediol dehydratase function will surely prove valuable.

metabolism of ethanolamine and choline
duplicate genes encoding ethanolamine ammonia-lyase , each being an unusual fusion of the large and small subunits, were found in the genome of p. carbinolicus, strains of which grow by splitting ethanolamine or choline into ammonia or trimethylamine plus acetaldehyde, which is disproportionated to ethanol plus acetate 
 <cit> . the duplication suggests that ethanolamine ammonia-lyase and choline trimethylamine-lyase may be distinct enzymes. the genes surrounding the two lyase genes are also duplicates, and encode periplasmic substrate-binding proteins  and multitransmembrane proteins  that may mediate uptake of ethanolamine or choline, as well as proteins of unknown function  of which a third paralog  is encoded next to one of the two ammonium transporters. the ethanolamine ammonia-lyase gene cluster consists of  <dig> genes transcribed in the same direction , and encodes one of the four predicted acetaldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductases .

the genes between eutbc <dig> and eutbc <dig> have functions in biosynthesis of cobalamin, the cofactor of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase . some of them are seemingly redundant with genes elsewhere in the genome , and some have diverged considerably from their counterparts in geobacteraceae. notably, there is no euta gene in the p. carbinolicus genome that encodes an atpase that replaces damaged cobalamin within ethanolamine ammonia-lyase
 <cit> , and the gene for cobalt-precorrin-6a reductase  has no homolog in any geobacter genome except on the plasmid of geobacter lovleyi. on the 3′ side of the eutbc <dig> genes are genes encoding an uncharacterized metal abc transporter related to transporters for corrinoids such as cobalamin, several ligand-binding proteins of the vwfa superfamily, an atpase, and an outer membrane channel for cobalamin. the cobalt abc transporter genes cbimnoq of geobacteraceae have no homologs in p. carbinolicus, and it is not apparent how cobalt uptake may occur other than by this putative cobalamin transport system. overall, the gene organization implies that p. carbinolicus may coordinate cobalamin uptake and biosynthesis with the need to metabolize ethanolamine and choline.

ethanol as product and substrate
ethanol and acetate are the end products of fermentation of  <dig> -butanediol, acetoin,  <dig> -ethanediol, ethanolamine or choline. however, in the presence of s° as an electron acceptor or electron shuttle to fe, or with a hydrogen/formate-consuming partner, p. carbinolicus can oxidize ethanol to acetate
 <cit> . remarkably, the enzymes predicted to interconvert ethanol, acetate and acetyl-coa with acetaldehyde are each encoded by multiple genes in p. carbinolicus , but geobacter species typically have one homolog per genome. this redundancy may reflect high flux through these reactions in p. carbinolicus in different growth modes.

two putative ethanol dehydrogenases  are upregulated during growth by ethanol oxidation compared to ethanol-producing fermentation of acetoin
 <cit> , suggesting that they may be specialized for oxidation, along with a third isozyme  that shares 94-97% sequence identity with them. two more isozymes , with 63% identity to each other and >54% identity to the first three, might be dedicated to ethanol production. consistent with this hypothesis, the candidate ethanol dehydrogenases of ethanol-oxidizing geobacter species  have greater sequence identity with the first three isozymes. during  <dig> -butanediol oxidation, ethanol dehydrogenase is not required in either direction, but only two isozymes, pcar_ <dig> and pcar_ <dig>  are downregulated  compared to  <dig> -butanediol fermentation . an ethanol dehydrogenase function has been hypothesized also for pcar_2506
 <cit> , but as noted above, this gene may be 3-hydroxypropanoate dehydrogenase.

acetyl-coa reductase has a catabolic function in  <dig> -butanediol fermentation, when half of the acetyl-coa produced by acetoin dehydrogenase is reduced to acetaldehyde and then to ethanol to dispose of electrons. this function is absent in acetoin fermentation because all electrons are donated to the acetaldehyde produced by acetoin dehydrogenase. acetyl-coa reductase also works in concert with acetaldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase to maintain oxidized nad and doubly reduced ferredoxin  at levels that drive catabolic reactions forward. during oxidation of ethanol or  <dig> -butanediol to acetate and in the early stage of acetoin fermentation when acetoin is the electron acceptor instead of acetaldehyde
 <cit> , acetyl-coa reductase functions oxidatively as acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. of the three predicted acetyl-coa reductase isozymes , pcar_ <dig> is downregulated during  <dig> -butanediol fermentation  <dig> -fold compared to ethanol oxidation and  <dig> -fold compared to  <dig> -butanediol oxidation , suggesting that its function is oxidative; pcar_ <dig> is upregulated during ethanol oxidation  <dig> -fold compared to acetoin fermentation
 <cit>  and  <dig> -fold compared to  <dig> -butanediol fermentation, but downregulated during  <dig> -butanediol oxidation  <dig> -fold compared to  <dig> -butanediol fermentation , indicating both oxidative and reductive roles; and the third isozyme, pcar_ <dig>  is not differentially expressed.

four genes encode putative acetaldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductases  sharing 72-79% sequence identity. transcription of aora <dig>  aora <dig> and aora <dig> is predicted to be controlled by riboswitches that bind “molybdenum cofactor,” of which one variant is the cofactor of acetaldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, bis--tungsten. these three isozymes are differentially expressed according to the mode of growth: aora <dig> is upregulated during  <dig> -butanediol fermentation  <dig> -fold compared to  <dig> -butanediol oxidation; aora <dig> is upregulated during ethanol oxidation  <dig> -fold compared to  <dig> -butanediol fermentation and  <dig> -fold compared to acetoin fermentation
 <cit> ; and aora <dig> is upregulated during acetoin fermentation  <dig> -fold compared to ethanol oxidation
 <cit> . no riboswitch was found on the 5′ side of aora <dig>  which is not differentially expressed. given the high sequence identity of these four isozymes and the presence of homologs in many geobacteraceae, it seems incorrect that the acetaldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase reaction was assigned to only one aora in the metabolic model of p. carbinolicus and omitted from the metabolic models of g. metallireducens and p. propionicus <cit> .

the biochemical characterization of these enzymes, whose substrate specificity was predicted based on gene copy number and differential expression rather than sequence identity with characterized enzymes, is an important topic for future research.

oxidation of 1-propanol and 1-butanol
with acetate as a carbon source, p. carbinolicus can utilize 1-propanol and 1-butanol as electron donors, either by transferring hydrogen/formate to a syntrophic partner
 <cit>  or by using s° as an electron acceptor or shuttle to fe
 <cit> . of the two enzymes that were assigned a 1-propanol dehydrogenase function in the metabolic model
 <cit> , one  has homologs in geobacteraceae that utilize 1-propanol but the other  is the  <dig> -propanediol dehydrogenase described above. the two 1-butanol dehydrogenases  predicted from the p. carbinolicus genome
 <cit>  have 34% and 41% sequence identity, respectively, to the bdha and bdhb isozymes of clostridium acetobutylicum <cit> , but pcar_ <dig> appears to be frameshifted. following oxidation of 1-propanol and 1-butanol to propanal and butanal, oxidation to propanoyl-coa and butanoyl-coa may be catalyzed by the acetaldehyde dehydrogenases  and conversion to propanoyl-phosphate and butanoyl-phosphate by the phosphate acetyltransferases . production of atp by substrate-level phosphorylation is catalyzed by propanoate kinase  and butanoate kinase .

partial oxidation of ethanol, 1-propanol or 1-butanol to acetate, propanoate or butanoate produces two nadh and one atp. growth of p. carbinolicus using these electron donors with hydrogen/formate transfer to a syntrophic partner implies that the energetic cost of exchange of two nadh for two hydrogen/formate molecules must be less than one atp. the candidate enzymes for this process  are the atp synthases that hydrolyze atp to pump protons or sodium ions, the rnf complex that exploits the transmembrane potential to reduce ferredoxin to fd2e with electrons from nadh
 <cit> , the nfn complex that exchanges one nadh plus one fd2e for two nadph
 <cit> , and nadph oxidoreductases that form complexes with cytoplasmic -hydrogenases
 <cit>  or formate dehydrogenase. the overall pathway requires the rnf complex to exchange one nadh for fd2e by passing fewer protons or sodium ions than the number pumped by hydrolysis of one atp. the number of protons or sodium ions pumped by hydrolysis of three atp is equal to the number of c subunits in atp synthase, which varies between  <dig> and  <dig> depending on the protein sequence of the c subunit
 <cit> . the number of c subunits in each atp synthase of p. carbinolicus is unknown, but can be estimated from the results of an experiment that compared the yield of p. carbinolicus cells with either ethanol or hydrogen as the electron donor, s° as an electron shuttle, and either soluble or insoluble fe as the terminal electron acceptor
 <cit> . assuming that the amount of energy expended per cell produced is invariant and that electron transfer from nadh to s° yields no energy, a comparison of the numbers of cells produced per fe reduced during growth on ethanol versus growth on hydrogen is a comparison of the energy yields that accompany reduction of nad by oxidation of ethanol versus oxidation of hydrogen. the same -hydrogenases that are predicted to produce hydrogen from nadph should also oxidize hydrogen and reduce nadp; the nfn complex can function in reverse to exchange two nadph for one nadh and one fd2e; and the rnf complex can function in reverse to produce a second nadh with electrons from fd2e, pumping fewer protons or sodium ions than can be used to make one atp. oxidation of ethanol also produces two nadh but yields one atp. thus, the number of protons or sodium ions pumped by hydrolysis of one atp , divided by the number of protons or sodium ions pumped by the rnf complex, should be equal to the ratio of cell yields of p. carbinolicus with ethanol and with hydrogen. growth of p. carbinolicus on ethanol compared to growth on hydrogen produced approximately  <dig>  times as many cells per soluble fe reduced and  <dig>  times as many cells per insoluble fe reduced
 <cit> . the best fit to these data is a model in which hydrolysis of three atp pumps ten protons or sodium ions and the rnf complex pumps two protons or sodium ions as electrons pass from fd2e to nad. thus, for each ethanol/1-propanol/1-butanol molecule oxidized to yield one atp and requiring transfer of four electrons as hydrogen/formate to a syntrophic partner, the cell is predicted to expend  <dig>  atp to pump two protons or sodium ions that are returned through the rnf complex, for a net energy yield of  <dig>  atp.

the next two sections will describe what the genome of p. carbinolicus reveals about its multiple atp synthases, hydrogenases, formate dehydrogenase and associated nadph oxidoreductases.

atp synthases and cation gradients
as p. carbinolicus derives atp by substrate-level phosphorylation in every mode of growth except when it transfers electrons from hydrogen/formate to s°
 <cit> , its atp synthases almost always function in reverse, generating proton or sodium ion gradients by atp hydrolysis. p. carbinolicus has duplicate ancestral sets of atp synthase genes and a third, acquired set
 <cit> . interestingly, in both ancestral sets, the b’ stalk subunit  that communicates between the proton channel and the atp-binding sites differs from those of geobacter species; its predicted isoelectric point is  <dig> , several ph units more acidic than those of geobacter species, which range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . this difference may reflect the need to transport protons in opposite directions.

the three gene sets are in notable locations . one copy of the ancestral genes is divided into two divergent operons flanking the chromosomal origin of replication at distances of  <dig> kbp  and  <dig> kbp , locations that favour constitutively high expression. this may be important because the end product of p. carbinolicus metabolism is acetate, which can diffuse across the inner membrane and re-enter as acetic acid, dissipating the proton gradient
 <cit> . this gene set includes the atpz and atpi genes that are found in geobacteraceae and implicated in import of magnesium
 <cit> .

the second ancestral copy  is located next to the previously described crispr locus
 <cit> . a sequence on the 5′ side of this operon  contains overlapping predicted binding sites  for the transcriptional regulator colr
 <cit> , followed by inverted repeats . it aligns with the pcar_r <dig> sequence located on the 5′ side of epta , encoding lipid a phosphoethanolamine transferase, an enzyme that may modify the outer membrane to increase resistance to acid and cationic peptides
 <cit> . colr  and its cognate sensor kinase cols  share 65% and 37% sequence identity, respectively, with homologs that regulate outer membrane modification in pseudomonas putida <cit> . therefore, whenever the metabolism of p. carbinolicus causes acetic acid to accumulate in its surroundings, it is likely to use colr signalling to impermeabilize the outer membrane and to overexpress atp synthase so as to regulate the acidity of the periplasm.

the laterally acquired atp synthase  is of the n-type, which translocates sodium ions rather than protons
 <cit> . these genes are transcribed divergently from a mechanosensitive ion channel gene , suggesting that expression of this atp synthase may be controlled to ensure rapid restoration of the sodium gradient dissipated by opening of the channel. compared to its homologs in g. sulfurreducens and geobacter metallireducens, pcar_ <dig> has an n-terminal extension of ~ <dig> amino acid residues comprised of a predicted periplasmic domain and eight additional transmembrane segments of unknown function. six other mechanosensitive channels are encoded by the genome of p. carbinolicus , of which only pcar_ <dig> has a homolog in any geobacter species, in geobacter daltonii. it might be valuable to investigate the roles of these ion channels in the physiology of p. carbinolicus.

interestingly, all genes of the n-type atp synthase operon are upregulated during fermentation of  <dig> -butanediol compared to oxidation of either  <dig> -butanediol or ethanol with fe as the electron acceptor , but are not upregulated during fermentation of acetoin. in contrast, several genes of the other two atp synthases are downregulated during fermentation of  <dig> -butanediol but not acetoin.

p. carbinolicus may interconvert the sodium ion and proton gradients using at least three antiporters : an mrp complex of seven subunits with homologs in various species
 <cit> ; nhaa, with 52% sequence identity to an e. coli antiporter that is activated at high ph
 <cit> ; and nhad, with 54% sequence identity to an alkalimonas amylolytica anitporter that functions at high sodium ion concentrations and high ph
 <cit> . p. carbinolicus may establish a potassium ion gradient by symport with a sodium ion through a ktr transporter  with 37-38% sequence identity to characterized homologs in b. subtilis <cit> . in contrast, potassium uptake in geobacteraceae may occur through atp-dependent kdp and proton gradient-dependent kup transporters, consistent with their growth at lower salt concentrations. the salt tolerance of p. carbinolicus may be due to production of an osmolyte, n-epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine, by l-lysine  <dig> -aminomutase  followed by beta-lysine n-epsilon-acetyltransferase , as in methanogens
 <cit> .

electron transfer to hydrogen and formate
the p. carbinolicus genome encodes three -hydrogenases  in different gene clusters , which may indicate their roles in various growth modes. hydrogenase hndd- <dig>  encoded near enzymes of the glycerol/ <dig> -propanediol oxidation pathway, may receive electrons from this pathway via an sfrb-like protein  as its nadph-oxidizing partner. hydrogenases hndd- <dig> and hndd- <dig> may each form a complex with a three-subunit nadph oxidoreductase encoded next to them , as is the case in desulfovibrio fructosovorans <cit> . the hypothesis that hndd- <dig> has a different partner than hndd- <dig> and hndd- <dig> is consistent with the fact that hndd- <dig> and hndd- <dig> share 83% sequence identity with each other but only 41-43% with hndd- <dig>  two of the maturation factors required by -hydrogenases, namely the -cluster assembly scaffold gtpase hydf
 <cit>  and the cyanide/carbon monoxide ligand-forming enzyme hydg
 <cit> , are encoded by the hndd <dig> gene cluster, but the third factor, hyde, hypothesized to synthesize the dithiolate ligand, is genetically triplicate  and may be unique to each hydrogenase.

the hndd <dig> gene cluster encodes aspartate ammonia-lyase between hydg and hydf, suggesting that p. carbinolicus may coordinate disposal of electrons as hydrogen with use of aspartate as a nitrogen source. the fate of fumarate made by aspartate ammonia-lyase is uncertain because p. carbinolicus does not utilize fumarate as an electron donor
 <cit>  and has no homolog of the dicarboxylate exchange transporter that geobacter species require to use fumarate as an electron acceptor and excrete succinate
 <cit> . nevertheless, p. carbinolicus possesses a sodium/dicarboxylate symporter  with 39% sequence identity to a staphylococcus aureus protein that imports fumarate, succinate and malate
 <cit> , as well as a more distantly related homolog . if p. carbinolicus can take up aspartate through these transporters and degrade it to acetate plus hydrogen/formate to yield an estimated  <dig>  atp , it would explain the aspartate ammonia-lyase gene’s location in the hndd <dig> gene cluster.

the hndd- <dig> gene cluster encodes an oxidoreductase  with a ccg domain pair typical of enzymes with quinone and/or disulfide substrates. an enzyme with 69% sequence identity to this oxidoreductase is encoded by pcar_ <dig> next to a transcriptional regulator of the arsr family  and a membrane protein of the duf <dig> family , which is encoded next to arsenate reductase in g. sulfurreducens and g. metallireducens. moreover, proteins of unknown function that share 39% sequence identity  are encoded next to one of the two arsenate reductases of p. carbinolicus  and next to an nadph oxidoreductase  with ~75% sequence identity to the hydrogenase-associated hndc proteins. these arrangements suggest that electron transfer to arsenate by p. carbinolicus may be mechanistically similar to hydrogen production.

a third set of nadph oxidoreductase subunit genes  is located next to a formate dehydrogenase catalytic subunit gene . this gene cluster encodes neither a hydrogenase nor the iron-sulfur cluster-binding and cytochrome b subunits of formate dehydrogenase, but it encodes formate dehydrogenase biogenesis proteins as well as carbonic anhydrase and a putative formate transporter, implying that these gene products work in concert to extract carbon dioxide from cytosolic bicarbonate, reduce it to formate with electrons from nadph, and excrete it, perhaps in exchange for periplasmic bicarbonate. thus, the genome of p. carbinolicus explains its ability to dispose of electrons as either hydrogen or formate depending on the uptake capabilities of its syntrophic partner
 <cit> . in the presence of s° as an electron acceptor or shuttle to fe, p. carbinolicus utilizes hydrogen and formate as electron donors
 <cit> , which implies that these enzymes also function in reverse to produce nadph.

a fourth nadph oxidoreductase complex with fused subunits and an extra ferredoxin-like cluster  is encoded next to an iron-sulfur cluster-binding protein that resembles a noncatalytic portion of formate dehydrogenase . this putative complex may partner with the iron-sulfur-oxygen hybrid cluster protein encoded nearby  to counter oxidative/nitrosative stress.

in addition to hydrogen and formate, p. carbinolicus may also dispose of electrons as carbon monoxide, as observed in desulfovibrio vulgaris <cit> . two carbon monoxide dehydrogenases and their predicted pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase partners are encoded by the p. carbinolicus genome . one gene set is near the chromosomal origin of replication, suggestive of constitutively high expression.

electron transfer to s° and to the outer surface
although p. carbinolicus is best known for fermentative and syntrophic growth, recent studies have offered clues regarding its use of s° as an electron acceptor and shuttle for electron transfer to fe, and more details have emerged from the curated genome annotation. electron transfer to s° is thought to involve two periplasmic thioredoxins , an outer membrane protein , and a cytoplasmic oxidoreductase  encoded by the most highly upregulated genes
 <cit> . as the elemental form of s°, circular s <dig>  is insoluble, it is thought to react extracellularly with sulfide, the end product of reduction, and to be reduced to linear polysulfides that are the true substrates of s° reductase
 <cit> . the periplasmic thioredoxins might reduce polysulfides further until the molecules are small enough to diffuse into the cytoplasm . periplasmic thioredoxins are reduced by ccda , a membrane protein that receives electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin, reduced in turn by nadph . when p. carbinolicus reduces s° with hydrogen as the electron donor
 <cit> , the use of nadp-reducing hydrogenases and the thioredoxin pathway would yield no energy. a more economical s° reductase must exist: either a cytoplasmic nadh-dependent enzyme  or a periplasmic c7-type cytochrome , which reduces s° in the related species desulfuromonas acetoxidans <cit> . another role of ccda is to reduce apocytochrome c disulfide reductase resa , but although resa and ccda are co-transcribed, only ccda is upregulated during growth on s°
 <cit> , indicating a role for periplasmic electron carriers but not necessarily c-type cytochromes.

the enzyme encoded by pcar_ <dig> has an fad-dependent pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain, a persulfide-forming rhodanese-like domain, and two persulfide relay domains . this combination suggests that the rhodanese-like domain displaces a sulfur atom from a substrate, forming a persulfide that is transferred to the tusa-like and dsre-like domains, disulfide bond formation releases the sulfur atom as sulfide, and an electron pair transferred from nadh via fad reduces the disulfide bond. if this cytoplasmic enzyme is the terminal s° reductase, it is likely to be peripherally associated with the inner membrane and oriented so that sulfide, a toxic product, is immediately protonated and diffuses outward .

when p. carbinolicus was first reported to express c-type cytochromes, four genes were predicted to encode its menaquinol:ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase
 <cit> . since that time, similar oxidoreductases encoded by act genes have been studied biochemically in rhodothermus marinus <cit>  and chloroflexus aurantiacus <cit> . six genes are now thought to encode the act complex of p. carbinolicus . oxidation of menaquinol typically releases protons to the periplasm, conserving energy as a proton gradient as electrons pass to c-type cytochromes. in a simple q loop, both electrons are transferred to c-type cytochromes and the gradient generated is of one proton per electron. however, menaquinol:ferricytochrome c oxidoreductases may also perform a more complicated q cycle in which one electron passes to c-type cytochromes while the other reduces another molecule of menaquinone with uptake of two protons from the cytoplasm, generating a gradient of two protons per electron. it is not known whether the act complex operates a q loop or a q cycle. in some species, it has only one menaquinol-binding subunit, actc, but in others including p. carbinolicus there is a second actc-like subunit, actf, with the potential to bind another molecule of menaquinone. in either case, electrons pass from menaquinol to c-type cytochromes at higher redox potential, and because the redox potential of s° is lower than that of menaquinone, d. acetoxidans and other species that use a c-type cytochrome to reduce s° must have a mechanism of reverse electron transport that has not yet been elucidated.

acte, the monoheme cytochrome c subunit that may be present in two copies per act complex as in c. aurantiacus <cit> , has eight predicted transmembrane segments in p. carbinolicus but only one in other species. this unique structure of acte, potentially a channel lined with eight cysteine residues , suggests that the act complex could transfer electrons from menaquinol not only to c-type cytochromes but to a disulfide-based electron carrier in the cytoplasm, a reverse electron transport process that could be driven by passage of protons through the channel . nearby the act operon are genes that encode dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase and a lipoyl carrier protein, larg, similar to that of the glycine cleavage complex , indicating the existence of a pathway in which an electron pair reduces the disulfide bond of lipoyl-larg, which is regenerated by reduction of nad. investigation of electron transfer and proton translocation by the act complex in p. carbinolicus would improve the metabolic model and the understanding of act complex diversity across species.

the number of predicted c-type cytochromes in p. carbinolicus now stands at sixteen : in addition to those identified previously
 <cit> , two gene products with corrected start sites  have signal peptides for translocation to the periplasm where heme is attached, and a sensor/regulator protein  is predicted to bind heme in its sensory domain. the designation of a glutamate synthase  as a c-type cytochrome by haveman et al. is dubious because it is a cytoplasmic enzyme and the imagined heme-binding motif cxxch within the flavin-binding domain is mutated to cxxcq in other species. although c-type cytochromes are few in p. carbinolicus, it has multiple cytochrome c biogenesis factors , as in geobacter genomes
 <cit> , which may attach heme to different c-type cytochromes. ligand-gated outer membrane channels , which perform active transport using the energy of the proton gradient transduced by periplasmic tonb-like proteins , are encoded near two c-type cytochrome genes , while tonb-like proteins  are encoded near the act genes and other outer membrane channel genes for uptake of cobalamin, fe and two unidentified solutes . all seven ligand-gated channel genes are near genes for periplasmic metal-binding proteins  or molybdopterin-binding proteins  or riboswitches responsive to cobalamin and molybdopterin, indicating that they may transport metals. three tetrapyrrole methyltransferases similar to those of cobalamin biosynthesis , one of which is also a c-type cytochrome, are encoded next to ligand-gated channels and may participate in biosynthesis of novel porphyrins that ligate metals other than fe and co. together, these features indicate that p. carbinolicus may employ c-type cytochromes in processes relevant to metals, although differently from its geobacter relatives.

appendages and secretion systems
g. sulfurreducens possesses metallic-like electroconductive pili
 <cit>  that are polymers of a unique subtype of type iva pilin known as geopilin
 <cit> . these pili enhance current production in fuel cells
 <cit>  and have been implicated in direct interspecies electron transfer within syntrophic aggregates
 <cit> . p. carbinolicus does not produce current
 <cit>  and does not engage in direct interspecies electron transfer with syntrophic partners that have lost the ability to accept hydrogen and formate
 <cit> , but nevertheless possesses genes for several kinds of pili and other appendages that will be described in this section. unlike the geopilin pilus biogenesis genes of geobacteraceae, which occupy distant chromosomal locations, those of p. carbinolicus are found in one location . p. carbinolicus has only one set of genes for the minor components of the pilus  and the assembly factor pily <dig>  which are very different in sequence from the multiple versions in g. sulfurreducens, g. metallireducens and geobacter bemidjiensis . surprisingly, the geopilin gene is tandemly duplicated in p. carbinolicus and a geopilin-like sequence is part of another protein  predicted to have two transmembrane segments. both geopilins of p. carbinolicus and pcar_ <dig> contain both the conserved core domain  <dig> and the variable domain  <dig>  which are split into two genes in many geobacteraceae . one geopilin  that is upregulated during ethanol oxidation  <dig> -fold relative to acetoin fermentation
 <cit>  and  <dig> -fold relative to  <dig> -butanediol fermentation  might increase the length of the pilus for attachment or electron transfer to the extracellular electron acceptor s°; the other geopilin gene adjacent to it  is not differentially expressed, nor is the pcar_ <dig> gene. in contrast, the genes pile, pilm, piln and pilq are upregulated  <dig> -to- <dig> -fold during  <dig> -butanediol fermentation relative to oxidation of either  <dig> -butanediol or ethanol , possibly adding more pilus biogenesis structures to the cell wall so that more numerous but shorter pili may be made from a lesser or equal supply of geopilin. notably, these genes were not upregulated during acetoin fermentation. it would be interesting to study whether pili allow biofilms to form and insulate cells from ethanol, which is produced at a  <dig> -fold higher level from  <dig> -butanediol than from the less reduced substrate acetoin.

p. carbinolicus also possesses unique type iva pilus biogenesis systems that are not found in geobacter genomes, called msh and pih . several msh genes are upregulated during s° reduction compared to  <dig> -butanediol fermentation, particularly the major pilin gene msha  that is  <dig> -fold higher during ethanol oxidation and  <dig> -fold higher during  <dig> -butanediol oxidation. msha is the only msh gene upregulated  during ethanol oxidation compared to acetoin fermentation
 <cit> . thus, the msh pilus may promote utilization of the extracellular electron acceptor s°. the pih pilus in both p. carbinolicus and p. propionicus is unusual in that the major pilin, piha, lacks the motif recognized by the peptidase/methyltransferase pild, suggesting that piha is either translocated without subsequent cleavage or processed by a putative nonmethylating peptidase among the pih proteins, pihh. three minor components of the pilus  retain the pild recognition motif and are much larger than those of the other pili, underscoring the uniqueness of the pih pilus.

type iva pili are evolutionarily related to type ii secretion systems. one type ii secretion system of geobacteraceae, the gsp system, is absent from p. carbinolicus, but the other, the pul system that is required for secretion of ompb, a laccase family multicopper oxidase with a role in the reduction of insoluble fe and mn oxides
 <cit> , is entirely duplicated, including pseudopilins pulg, oxpg and tklg . there is no ompb-like gene in p. carbinolicus, but these systems may secrete other proteins. the proximity of both pul gene sets to genes of cell division and dna uptake and metabolism is notable, as in geobacter genomes.

p. carbinolicus also possesses genes for a more distantly related type ivb flp pilus , in which the flp gene encoding the major pilin is duplicated, and for a sigma-fimbria
 <cit>  with duplicate adhesins . the flp pilus biogenesis genes are all highly upregulated during  <dig> -butanediol fermentation , with flp <dig> expression increased  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold compared to  <dig> -butanediol oxidation and ethanol oxidation, respectively, and flp <dig> expression increased  <dig> -fold compared to  <dig> -butanediol oxidation.  in contrast, decreased expression during  <dig> -butanediol fermentation compared to oxidation of  <dig> -butanediol or ethanol was observed for the sigma-fimbria adhesin genes csua  and csub  and chaperone gene csuc . it would be interesting to study how different appendages contribute to the fitness of p. carbinolicus in growth modes with different substrates and products.

p. carbinolicus possesses flagellar biogenesis genes , and has multiple flagellin genes flic as do g. bemidjiensis and g. lovleyi. both flic <dig> and flic <dig> are highly upregulated during ethanol oxidation compared to fermentation of  <dig> -butanediol  or acetoin 
 <cit> , whereas flic <dig>  encoding a longer flagellin, is not differentially expressed. flagellins of p. carbinolicus are likely to be glycosylated to impart a negative charge by enzymes encoded among the flagellar biogenesis genes. different enzymes are encoded at the corresponding locations in geobacter genomes. flagellar motility may be controlled by a chemotactic signalling system encoded among flagellar biogenesis genes. multiple chemotaxis-like signalling systems have been found in geobacter genomes
 <cit> , but p. carbinolicus has only one complete and two rudimentary systems . the chemoreceptors called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins  associated with different systems are classified according to the number of heptads of amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain, which determines the locations of the methylation sites
 <cit> . twelve of the fifteen mcp of p. carbinolicus belong to class 36h , in contrast with at most one mcp of this class in geobacteraceae. conversely, mcp of classes 40h, 40+24h and 34h, which predominate in geobacteraceae, are few or absent in p. carbinolicus, indicating near-total dissimilarity in chemotactic signalling.

the p. carbinolicus genome encodes four type v secretion systems in which a single protein called an autotransporter inserts its carrier domain into the outer membrane and extrudes its passenger domain . no autotransporters have been found in any geobacter genome, indicating that the need for proteins that reach the outer surface by this process may be specific to p. carbinolicus. a part of the passenger domain of pcar_ <dig> is a predicted cysteine peptidase, but the functions of the passenger domains are otherwise unknown. autotransporter pcar_ <dig> is  <dig> -fold upregulated during  <dig> -butanediol fermentation relative to oxidation of either  <dig> -butanediol or ethanol .

the type vi secretion system of p. carbinolicus , whereby proteins may be injected into nearby bacterial or eukaryotic cells, consists of components that distantly resemble those of geobacteraceae. notably, the syringe protein tssi, which forms the tip of the needlelike appendage, has been duplicated in p. carbinolicus. altogether, the appendages and secretion systems of p. carbinolicus appear more variegated than those of geobacteraceae. duplicated pilins, pseudopilins, adhesins, flagellins and syringe proteins may allow p. carbinolicus to present different features on the outer surface and to evolve these features rapidly.

the defect in acetate oxidation
with s° as an electron acceptor or shuttle to fe, p. carbinolicus excretes acetate instead of oxidizing it through the tca cycle. sun et al. have speculated that it does so because it lacks an unspecified atp-driven reaction between succinate oxidation and s° reduction
 <cit> . in more specific terms, succinate dehydrogenase of the tca cycle reduces menaquinone, and sun et al. modelled hydrogen and nadph as the only electron donors to s°, which would require reverse electron transport. however, succinate oxidation with s° reduction was shown to be proton-gradient-dependent but nad-independent for d. acetoxidans <cit> , a relative of p. carbinolicus, and ppca  is homologous to a periplasmic c7-type cytochrome of d. acetoxidans that reduces s°
 <cit> . p. carbinolicus expresses ppca specifically during growth with fe, along with the act complex pentaheme cytochrome subunit acta
 <cit> , implying that it may perform reverse electron transport from menaquinol to a low-redox-potential c-type cytochrome that can reduce s°. as there is no evidence of a defect in reverse electron transport, one must consider what else could prevent acetate oxidation by p. carbinolicus.

the idea that any of the tca cycle enzymes might be poorly active is disfavoured by the presence of two nad-specific glutamate dehydrogenases in p. carbinolicus: gdhb  is 29% identical to a thermotoga maritima enzyme
 <cit>  and gdhc  is 31% identical to a streptomyces clavuligerus enzyme with multiple allosteric effectors
 <cit> . the presence of these catabolic enzymes and not the nadp-specific gdha of geobacteraceae implies that p. carbinolicus has evolved to utilize glutamate as an electron donor, oxidizing 2-oxoglutarate through a partial tca cycle to succinate to yield atp. as there is no candidate transporter for p. carbinolicus to excrete succinate, further oxidation with reverse electron transport from menaquinol to an electron acceptor or syntrophic partner seems more likely. excretion of fumarate, malate or oxaloacetate poses the same problem, but oxaloacetate might be oxidized by a 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase of uncharacterized substrate specificity that is encoded next to gdhb , producing malonyl-coa or acetyl-coa. thus, catabolic oxidation of glutamate would imply high activity of five of the eight tca cycle enzymes, while the ability to make glutamate for biosynthetic purposes from other growth substrates suggests that the other three enzymes are also active. the presence of catabolic glutamate dehydrogenases and aspartate ammonia-lyase and the absence of known asparagine synthetases suggest that p. carbinolicus is accustomed to take up glutamate, aspartate and asparagine from its environment. if it operates the tca cycle catabolically with oxaloacetate derived from these amino acids, its ability to make its own oxaloacetate may have diminished due to relaxed selective pressure.

during growth on any of its known substrates, p. carbinolicus must convert acetyl-coa to oxaloacetate for biosynthetic purposes through pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase  and pyruvate carboxylase. if either of these reactions is too slow, excess oxaloacetate will not accumulate to a level that can sustain a catabolic tca cycle. both por isozymes  and the pyruvate carboxylase  of p. carbinolicus share 68-75% sequence identity with their counterparts in geobacter species and d. acetoxidans, which does not suggest major differences in activity, but interestingly, the ferredoxins and flavodoxins that could donate electrons to por are very different between p. carbinolicus and its relatives . whereas geobacteraceae have multiple single-4fe4s-cluster ferredoxins similar to the preferred partner of por in desulfovibrio africanus <cit> , which suit the radical chemistry of acetyl-coa reduction by por by donating one electron at a time, p. carbinolicus has two double-4fe4s-cluster ferredoxins that can carry two electrons, and six flavodoxin-like proteins. this difference suggests that electron transfer to por from its ferredoxin/flavodoxin partners might be inefficient and limit production of oxaloacetate in p. carbinolicus, thereby preventing oxidation of acetate. this hypothesis offers a new direction for investigation of the unique metabolism of p. carbinolicus.

production of  <dig> -butanediol from sugar substrates
the p. carbinolicus genome encodes an -α-acetolactate decarboxylase  with 37% sequence identity to the characterized enzyme of b. subtilis <cit> , an indication that acetoin and  <dig> -butanediol are not only growth substrates of p. carbinolicus but possibly end products of fermentation . -α-acetolactate, a precursor of valine and leucine, can be made from two molecules of pyruvate by a biosynthetic-type synthase  with a regulatory subunit , but a fermentative pathway requires an additional catabolic-type -α-acetolactate synthase. three uncharacterized thiamin-dependent enzymes  are candidates for this function. it would be valuable to determine the functions of these three enzymes.

the presence of -α-acetolactate decarboxylase is unexpected because none of the known growth substrates of p. carbinolicus is catabolized through pyruvate.  an inability to ferment sugars through glycolysis is thought to be a defining characteristic of pelobacter species
 <cit> . nevertheless, the p. carbinolicus genome encodes a full set of phosphotransferase system proteins for sugar uptake . in geobacteraceae this phosphotransferase system is vestigial, comprised of signalling proteins orthologous to the two phosphoenolpyruvate--protein phosphotransferases ptsi  and ptsp , the phosphocarrier protein ptsh , and one or both signal output proteins iia  of p. carbinolicus, plus a third protein iia that is absent from p. carbinolicus. in addition to the signalling proteins, the p. carbinolicus genome encodes a set of sugar uptake proteins iib, iic and iid  that have no homologs in geobacteraceae. interestingly, the hprk gene encoding a kinase/phosphatase to modulate ptsh activity is missing in p. carbinolicus, but an uncharacterized kinase  is encoded among phosphotransferase system components in p. carbinolicus and geobacteraceae. it would be valuable to investigate whether any sugars can be taken up by p. carbinolicus.

the penultimate intermediate of glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate, carries a high-energy phosphate that may be used to activate an incoming sugar by the phosphotransferase system or to make atp. in p. carbinolicus, but not in geobacter species, phosphoenolpyruvate may also be rearranged to phosphonopyruvate by a phosphomutase  with 63% sequence identity to the characterized enzyme of mytilus edulis <cit> , possibly to dispose of excess glycolytic intermediates when the atp-to-adp ratio is high. the synthetic and degradative polyphosphate kinases of geobacter species are absent from p. carbinolicus, indicating an inability to transfer high-energy phosphates from excess atp to a storage polymer. no characterized phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase has a homolog in p. carbinolicus; the assignment of an archaeal-type 3-phosphoglycerate mutase  to this function in the metabolic model
 <cit>  is doubtful. speculatively, a 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase-related protein  encoded by the same operon as the phosphomutase might reduce phosphonopyruvate to phosphonoglycerate, but it is not clear where this pathway leads.

assuming that p. carbinolicus can convert a sugar substrate to glucose-6-phosphate, oxidize it to pyruvate, and make acetoin or  <dig> -butanediol as end products, two questions arise: why would p. carbinolicus dispose of just half the nadh made from glycolysis by making  <dig> -butanediol  if it could dispose of all the nadh by making ethanol, and why does it possess an oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway to make nadph when it can use the nfn complex to exchange nadh from glycolysis plus fd2e from por for nadph? the answer to both questions may be in the ability of por to interact with ferredoxin. if electron transfer from por to ferredoxin is too inefficient for catabolic oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-coa that can be reduced to ethanol - a hypothesis consistent with the observation that p. carbinolicus does not utilize pyruvate as a fermentative substrate
 <cit> , pyruvate from glycolysis would have to be converted to acetoin or  <dig> -butanediol with the excess nadh converted via fd2e and nadph to hydrogen/formate. the rnf complex can exchange nadh for fd2e at an estimated cost of  <dig>  atp, but more energetically costly reactions may be required to ensure that nadh does not accumulate to inhibitory levels.  the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway essentially allows three carbon dioxide molecules and six nadph to be made instead of pyruvate and nadh at a cost of one atp. thus, p. carbinolicus appears well-equipped to ferment sugars with a syntrophic partner.

p. carbinolicus possesses enzymes for degradation of 2-deoxyribose: if import via the phosphotransferase system activates this sugar to 2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate, it may be converted to 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate by a phosphopentomutase  with 41% sequence identity to the e. coli enzyme
 <cit>  and split into acetaldehyde plus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by a 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase  with 38% sequence identity to the mycoplasma pneumoniae enzyme
 <cit> . the predicted end products of this pathway are ethanol, acetate and  <dig> -butanediol in a 1:1: <dig> ratio , yielding  <dig>  atp per molecule of 2-deoxyribose. the same enzymes may metabolize ribose, making glycolaldehyde instead of acetaldehyde. if any of the five ethanol dehydrogenases can reduce glycolaldehyde to  <dig> -ethanediol, the end products would be  <dig> -ethanediol and acetoin in a 2: <dig> ratio  and the yield would be  <dig> atp per molecule of ribose. there is also a d-ribulose-1-phosphate/l-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase  with 38% sequence identity to the e. coli enzyme
 <cit> , by which p. carbinolicus could metabolize ribulose to glycolaldehyde plus glycerone-phosphate. the end products and atp yield from ribulose would be the same as for ribose. future studies should determine whether p. carbinolicus can metabolize these or other sugars without a syntrophic partner.

production of one-carbon units
geobacteraceae derive one-carbon units carried by tetrahydrofolate in two ways: from the hydroxymethyl group of serine as it is converted to glycine and by cleavage of excess glycine to release ammonia and carbon dioxide. p. carbinolicus has a serine hydroxymethyltransferase  but lacks the genes of the glycine cleavage system. therefore, the genome of p. carbinolicus was searched for an alternative pathway to dispose of excess glycine. the discovery of glycerate 3-kinase  led to the hypothesis that two glycine molecules are deaminated, fused, and funnelled into glycolysis through glycerate . three uncharacterized thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes  are candidates for glyoxalate carboligase
 <cit>  to perform the fusion, and the fusion product is speculated to be rearranged to hydroxypyruvate by a hemithioacetal isomerase  with the aid of glutathione. enzymes for glutathione synthesis have not been identified in geobacteraceae, but p. carbinolicus possesses at least the first enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase , with 35% sequence identity to the characterized brassica juncea enzyme
 <cit> . another hemithioacetal isomerase  has 56% sequence identity to the characterized neisseria meningitidis enzyme
 <cit>  that serves to detoxify methylglyoxal, a byproduct of glycolysis formed by spontaneous dephosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, by rearranging it to s-lactylglutathione. the presence of this enzyme in p. carbinolicus but not geobacteraceae supports the idea that glycolysis is a catabolic pathway in p. carbinolicus. the pcar_ <dig> hemithioacetal isomerase shares only 31% sequence identity with the n. meningitidis enzyme, so a different function such as isomerization of 2-hydroxy-3-oxopropanoate is plausible. s-lactylglutathione hydrolase  is required to release lactate from glutathione, but isomerization of a hemithioacetal of 2-hydroxy-3-oxopropanoate should release glutathione automatically. if indeed p. carbinolicus is able to convert glycine to hydroxypyruvate, it should also be able to catabolize glycine taken up from its environment, as suggested by the presence of a putative glycine/alanine uptake transporter . whereas hydroxypyruvate might be recycled to serine directly by various aminotransferases , recycling through glycerate 3-kinase costs  <dig> atp, but allows hydroxypyruvate to enter a catabolic pathway of glycolysis. it will be interesting to study how p. carbinolicus disposes of excess glycine and what exogenous amino acids it can utilize.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a curated genome annotation of p. carbinolicus was used to predict its metabolic pathways and physiological features. candidate enzymes, some with structural innovations, were identified for catabolism of  <dig> -butanediol, acetoin, glycerol,  <dig> -ethanediol, ethanolamine, choline and ethanol, and newly predicted substrates:  <dig> -propanediol, aspartate, glutamate and sugars. pathways for energy transduction, electron transfer to s°, and production of hydrogen and formate were described. remarkable features such as the mutant trna, cellular appendages and autotransporters were noted. the genome contents suggested that limited activity of por could account for both the failure of p. carbinolicus to oxidize acetate through the tca cycle and the presence of enzymes to ferment sugars to  <dig> -butanediol rather than ethanol. altogether, this work reveals that p. carbinolicus may be metabolically and physiologically more versatile than anticipated and possesses several unique features that deserve further investigation.
