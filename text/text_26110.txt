BACKGROUND
skin color is an important determinant of apple fruit quality. generally, consumers prefer red-skinned apples as they are perceived to be associated with better taste and flavor  <cit> . coloration of apple fruit is attributed to accumulation of anthocyanins, a class of plant flavonoid metabolites. flavonoids are ubiquitous in plants, and play important roles throughout plant growth, including uv protection, disease resistance, herbivore defense, and providing flowers and seeds with pigmentation to attract pollinators and seed dispersers  <cit> . more importantly, there is increasing evidence that flavonoids benefit human health such as lowering the incidence of cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and cancer  <cit> .

the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins has been well established, and anthocyanin pathway genes have been isolated and characterized in a variety of model plants such as petunia, snapdragon, and arabidopsis  <cit> . anthocyanin biosynthesis is genetically determined by structural and regulatory genes. the structural genes are regulated at the transcriptional level by regulatory genes, and thus plant pigmentation patterns are mainly controlled by the expression profiles of regulatory genes  <cit> .

three transcription factors , including the basic helix-loop-helix , r2r <dig> myb, and wd <dig> proteins, predominantly regulate genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway across all plant species reported to date, including apple  <cit> . myb tfs have been reported to play diverse functions in controlling pathways such as secondary metabolism, development, signal transduction, and disease resistance in plants  <cit> . they are classified by the numbers of highly conserved imperfect repeats in the dna-binding domain, and consisting of either single or multiple repeats. among these myb tfs, the class of two-repeats  is deemed the largest, with  <dig> tfs reported in arabidopsis  <cit> , and it is associated with the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway.

regulation of r2r <dig> myb tfs can occur at different steps of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. for example, r2r <dig> myb tfs in perilla  control transcription of all structural genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . myba in grape  specifically regulates genes down-stream of anthocyanin production, but not those of earlier steps  <cit> . as with other transcription factors, regulation of r2r <dig> myb tfs could serve to either activate or repress expression of these genes. for example, myb tfs such as arabidopsis pap <dig>  atpap <dig>  atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig>  <cit> , grape vvmyb1a  <cit> , and gerbera hybrid ghmyb <dig>  <cit>  positively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis. suppression of flavonoid accumulation has been observed in transgenic plants overexpressing strawberry famyb <dig>  <cit> , antirrhinum ammyb <dig>  <cit> , arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  <cit> , and arabidopsis atmybl <dig> which encode a single-repeat r3-myb protein  <cit> .

in recent years, several studies have been reported on the characterization of structural and regulatory genes involved in fruit coloration in apple . for example, induction of most structural genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway can significantly increase accumulation of anthocyanin in apple skin  <cit> . three transcription factors, mdmyb <dig>  mdmyb <dig>  and mdmyba, have been isolated and characterized in apple  <cit> . of the three tfs, mdmyb <dig> is responsible for red flesh coloration, while mdmyb <dig> and mdmyba control red skin coloration of apple fruit. the three mdmyb genes are almost identical in nucleotide sequences, and have been subsequently reported to be of different alleles on linkage group  <dig>  <cit> . recently, chagné et al.  <cit>  have reported that the red-flesh cortex phenotype of apple fruit is associated with enhanced expression of myb110a, a paralog of myb <dig>  and functional analysis of myb110a in tobacco has revealed that it is involved in up-regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. apple fruits vary considerably in color, ranging from yellow, green, or red, along with varied differences in red color pigmentation patterns. it seems unlikely that apple fruit skin red coloration is simply controlled by a single locus.

isolation and characterization of myb tfs associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis is an important key step towards understanding and manipulating fruit coloration. in this study, a myb tf, designated mdmyb <dig>  has been identified using an apple expressed sequence tag  database  <cit>  and a bac-based physical map of the apple genome  <cit> . the mdmyb <dig> gene shows higher levels of expression in exocarp of red-skinned apple cultivars than that of yellowish-green skinned apple cultivars. transgenic flowers overexpressing mdmyb <dig> accumulate higher levels of anthocyanin and have longer peduncles and styles when compared with those of wild-type flowers. these results strongly suggest that mdmyb <dig> not only regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis, but is also involved in flower and pistil development.

RESULTS
sequence characterization of mdmyb <dig> in apple
a genomic dna sequence encoding r2r <dig> myb has been isolated from cv. goldrush. when this sequence is blasted against the arabidopsis genome sequence database , a best hit to the atmyb <dig> gene is found, and thus the gene is designated as mdmyb <dig>  the mdmyb <dig> gene consists of three exons and two introns along with two tandem repeats,  <dig>  designated as ssr <dig> in the 5′ un-translated region , as well as a dinucleotide  <dig>  designated as ssr <dig> in the last exon . the full-length cdna of mdmyb <dig> is  <dig>  bp in size and encodes a putative protein of  <dig> amino acids along with an atg start codon, at position  <dig> of the nucleotide sequence, and a tga stop codon, at position  <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences of r2r <dig> myb encoding genes from different plants indicates that mdmyb <dig> is very closely related to arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig> , belonging to the subgroup  <dig> r2r <dig> family of plant myb transcription factors  <cit> . amino acid sequence alignment between mdmyb <dig> and several previously reported myb transcription factors, including arabidopsis atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig>  fragaria ananasa famyb <dig>  and zea mays zmmyb <dig> have revealed that mdmyb <dig> consists of both r <dig> and r <dig> dna-binding domains . an r/b-like bhlh binding motif . moreover, mdmyb <dig> contains two conserved motifs lisrgidpxt/shrxi/l  and pdlnld/elxig/s  at the c-terminus, previously found in r2r <dig> myb encoding genes of subgroup  <dig>  however, the c-terminal downstream of the two conserved motifs shows high divergence. mdmyb <dig> has a 50% amino acid sequence identity with atmyb <dig> 

mapping of the mdmyb <dig> gene onto the apple genetic map
two pairs of primers flanking the ssr <dig> and ssr <dig> repeats within the mdmyb <dig> gene were designed and used to screen the two parents of the f <dig> population of the ′co-op 16′ x 'co-op 17′ cross. the two parents were found to be heterozygous and homozygous at ssr <dig> and ssr <dig> loci, respectively . the primers flanking the ssr <dig> locus was then selected to screen f <dig> progenies of 'co-op 16′ x 'co-op 17′ cross. as a result, three genotypes, designated 'hh’ , 'hk’ , and 'kk’ , respectively, were identified for the ssr <dig> locus among this progeny . based on our recently constructed apple genetic linkage map  <cit> , the apple mdmyb <dig> gene was anchored onto linkage group  <dig> .

expression profiles of mdmyb <dig> in apple
expression profiles of mdmyb <dig> in apple cvs. red delicious  and golden delicious  were investigated. quantitative real-time -pcr analysis revealed that mdmyb <dig> transcripts accumulated in all analyzed tissues, including leaves, flowers, and fruits . overall, transcript levels of mdmyb <dig> in all analyzed tissues were higher in cv. red delicious than those in cv. golden delicious. accumulation of mdmyb <dig> transcripts in flowers of 'red delicious’ increased throughout flower development and reached a peak at full-bloom , while transcripts of mdmyb <dig> in flowers of 'golden delicious’ showed a peak at the balloon stage , and then slightly decreased until full-bloom . transcripts of mdmyb <dig> in fruits of both cvs. red delicious and golden delicious increased during early stages of development, but then decreased slightly at 44 days after pollination . subsequently, transcript accumulation of mdmyb <dig> in fruits of cv. golden delicious gradually increased until maturity; whereas, those of cv. red delicious peaked at fruit stage iv, and remained relatively high at fruit maturity.

subsequently, a total of  <dig> apple cultivars were selected and used to investigate the association of mdmyb <dig> gene expression with anthocyanin accumulation in excocarp of fruits at maturity. overall, mdmyb <dig> transcripts were highly expressed in excocarp of red-skinned fruits, but were either low or undetectable in yellowish-green skinned fruits . these expression profiles were accompanied with similar anthocyanin content profiles in cortex tissues of these apple cultivars . this finding further confirmed that mdmyb <dig> was involved in anthocyanin accumulation in apple.

functional analysis of mdmyb <dig> in tobacco
the coding sequence of mdmyb <dig>  driven by the constitutive promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus  35s, was introduced into tobacco, and three t <dig> transgenic lines, designated as oe- <dig>  oe- <dig>  and oe- <dig>  were generated. flowers of transgenic lines showed darker color pigmentation than those of wild-type plants. for example, corolla of flowers of plants of line oe- <dig> began to show pink coloration during earlier stages of flower development than those of wild-type plants . subsequently at early bloom, corolla of flowers of oe- <dig> were almost dark pink while those of wild-type were light pink . corolla of flowers of all three transgenic lines continued to show increased pigmentation until full-bloom , and showed markedly darker pink coloration, almost fuchsia, than those of wild-type plants .

lc/ms/ms analysis revealed that transgenic flowers of tobacco contained higher levels of flavonoids than wild-type flowers . for example, levels of cyanidin in transgenic flowers were 2- to 4-fold higher than those of wild-type flowers. moreover, levels of two proanthocyanidin components, catechin and epicatechin, in transgenic flowers were  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold and  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold, respectively, higher than those of wild-type flowers. these findings suggested that mdmyb <dig> was involved in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in tobacco flowers.

*kaempferol, quercetin, cyanidin, catechin, and epicatechin were used as standards. all data correspond to mean values of three biological replicates.

in addition to flower color pigmentation, differences in other morphological traits, including lengths of flowers and lengths of styles of pistils, were also observed between wild-type and transgenic lines. for example, at full bloom, flowers of tobacco plants of transgenic line oe- <dig> were longer, on average 8-10 mm longer, than those of wild-type plants . moreover, lengths of styles of pistils of transgenic flowers were also longer, on average 10- 14 mm longer, than those of wild-type flowers, thus positioning stigmas above anthers .

expression profiles of structural genes of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways in tobacco transgenic flowers overexpressing mdmyb3
transcripts of  <dig> structural genes involved in biosynthesis pathways of both phenylpropanoid and flavonoid were evaluated in flowers of both wild-type and transgenic tobacco plants . of these  <dig> genes, flavonoid-specific genes, including ntchi, ntchs, ntans, ntufgt, ntan <dig>  and ntcomt showed similar patterns in transcript accumulation for all three transgenic lines as they were significantly up-regulated compared to those of wild-type flowers . moreover, transcripts of ntdfr and three phenylpropanoid pathway genes including ntc4h, nt4cl <dig>  and ntcad exhibited similar patterns of gene expression as they were all down-regulated in flowers of all three transgenic lines compared to those of wild-type plants. all remaining genes showed different patterns of gene expression in flowers transgenic lines when compared to those wild-type plants.

discussion
multiple r2r <dig> tfs have been reported to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in many plant species  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether or not there are additional loci, other than the mdmyb <dig> locus. using second-generation resequencing, chagné et al.  <cit>  have identified  <dig> snps within a 60-kb region surrounding the two alleles myb110a and myb110b that are involved in the regulation of red flesh  color pigmentation of apple fruit. chromosomal location of myb110a has been attributed to whole-genome duplication event that occurred during the evolution of apple within the maloideae family  <cit> . this is to be expected as integration of an apple physical and genetic maps have demonstrated presence of both genome-wide and segmental duplications in the apple genome and providing further insights into the complex polyploid ancestral origin of the apple  <cit> . in this study, a novel r2r <dig> myb transcription factor mdmyb <dig> in apple has been isolated, and its ectopic expression in tobacco flowers indicates that it is involved in flower coloration, peduncle length, and style/stigma development.

the apple mdmyb <dig> is involved in regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway
when the coding dna sequence of mdmyb <dig> was blasted against the arabidopsis genome sequence database , hits to subgroup  <dig> of myb tfs were detected, including those of atmyb <dig>  atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig> with e-values of 3e- <dig>  2e- <dig>  and 1e- <dig>  respectively. although atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> have not been functionally characterized, atmyb <dig> has been reported to function as a repressor of the lignin biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . it is noteworthy to point out that the mdmyb <dig> gene identified in this study is different from myb repressors reported by lin-wang et al.  <cit> . although, it is originally anticipated that mdmyb <dig> would have a similar function to that of atmyb <dig>  flowers of transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing mdmyb <dig> have accumulated higher levels of anthocyanin than those of wild-type plants, resulting in increased color pigmentation. analysis of gene expression profiles in flowers of t <dig> transgenic lines has further revealed that mdmyb <dig> contributes to activation of ntchi, ntchs, ntans, ntufgt, and ntan <dig> genes, and some degree of repression of the ntdfr gene. these results clearly indicate that mdmyb <dig> is involved in regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. the functionality of subgroup  <dig> myb genes involved in activation of anthocyanin synthesis has also been reported in maize  <cit> . the maize zmmyb <dig> gene is closely related to mdmyb <dig>  and its overexpression in arabidopsis has been reported to enhance transcription of anthocyanin pathway genes including those of chi, f3h, f3′h, and dfr.

more recently, an r2r <dig> myb regulator from tobacco, ntan <dig>  has been isolated and reported to be a key gene controlling anthocyanin production in reproductive tissues of tobacco  <cit> . interestingly in this study, expression levels of ntan <dig> in flowers of transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing mdmyb <dig> are significantly higher than those of wild-type plants . zhao et al.  <cit>  have reported that arabidopsis myb <dig> contains a myb binding site motif acac. the myb <dig> protein can interact with its own myb binding motif, thus regulating its own expression through an autoregulatory mechanism. we have analyzed the promoter sequence of the tobacco ntan <dig> , and found a myb binding site motif, aactaac, located at - <dig> to -811 bp upstream of the start codon. to clarify the role of mdmyb <dig> in regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis, it is worthy to investigate as whether or not the mdmyb <dig> protein can bind to the promoter region of the ntan <dig> that may subsequently lead to transcriptional activation of ntan <dig>  however, it cannot be ruled out that mdmyb <dig> may positively regulate expression of flavonoid structural genes such as chs and ufgt. previously it has been reported that expression levels of ufgt in the red-skinned cv. red delicious are significantly higher than those in the yellow-skinned cv. golden delicious  <cit> . herein, we further demonstrate that mdmyb <dig> strongly activates transcription of the ufgt gene in flowers of transgenic tobacco lines. further studies are needed to determine whether or not the mdmyb <dig> protein can bind to the promoter region of mdufgt and contributing to increased accumulation of anthocyanin.

in this study, ectopic expression of mdmyb <dig> in tobacco has contributed to anthocyanin accumulation, predominantly detected in reproductive tissues. similar findings have been reported for transgenic tobacco lines carrying an apple mdmyba gene  <cit>  as well as transgenic arabidopsis lines carrying an apple mdmyb <dig> <cit> . in contrast, several other anthocyanin-related tfs such as the grape vlmyba1- <dig>  gerbera gmyb <dig>  tomato leant <dig>  and arabidopsis atpap <dig> are capable of inducing anthocyanin accumulation in whole plants  <cit> . previously, it has been reported that these myb genes are capable of activating bhlh transcription, and thus forming a complex with bhlh to promote accumulation of anthocyanin  <cit> . in this study, mdmyb <dig> may not function as a bhlh activator. instead, it may combine with a tissue-specific bhlh to activate transcription of either ntan <dig> or other anthocyanin pathway genes, resulting in anthocyanin accumulation in flowers.

in apple, mdmyb <dig> and mdmyb <dig> strongly up-regulate most flavonoid structural genes, including mdchi, mdchs, mdf3h, mdldox, mddfr, and mdufgt  <cit> . in contrast in this study, mdmyb <dig> activates transcription of ntchi, ntchs, and ntufgt genes in tobacco flowers, but it inhibits transcription of the ntdfr gene. moreover, expression levels of structural genes such as ntf3h, ntf3′h, ntfls, and ntldox in flowers of transgenic tobacco in this study are on average similar to those detected in flowers of wild-type plants. these findings suggest that the role of mdmyb <dig> in regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway may be different from those of mdmyb <dig> and mdmyb <dig>  this is consistent with the phylogenetic analysis that revealed that mdmyb <dig> is separated from mdmyb10/mdmyb <dig>  moreover, mdmyb <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  and is expressed at higher levels in the cortex of red-skinned apple cultivars than in yellowish-green skinned apple cultivars. therefore, it seems that myb tfs other than mdmyb10/mdmyb <dig>  located on chromosome  <dig>  may also be involved in the regulation of apple red skin coloration.

the phylogenetic analysis indicates that mdmyb <dig> has a close relationship with arabidopsis atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  these two arabidopsis myb tfs positively regulate expression of chs, fls, and f3h genes, and are thus responsible for accumulation of flavonol  <cit> . similarly in this study, mdmyb <dig> is activating transcription of ntchs and ntfls in flowers of transgenic tobacco. overall, levels of kaempferol and quercetin in flowers of transgenic tobacco plants are higher than those in wild-type plants . therefore, it seems that the apple mdmyb <dig> gene is also involved in positive regulation of flavonol accumulation. interestingly, the arabidopsis atmyb <dig> does not contain an r/b-like bhlh binding motif, thus it functions independently of a bhlh cofactor  <cit> . however, mdmyb <dig> has an r/b-like bhlh binding motif, suggesting it can form a complex with bhlh to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis. thus, it is likely that the apple mdmyb <dig> gene has functionally diverged from the arabidopsis atmyb <dig> 

functional divergence of the apple mdmyb <dig> from its closely related genes
the mdmyb <dig> gene is clustered together with the strawberry famyb <dig> . ectopic expression of famyb <dig> in tobacco inhibits accumulation of both anthocyanins and flavonols, resulting in strong reduction in flower pigmentation  <cit> . overexpression of famyb <dig> in tobacco flowers down-regulates transcription of late flavonoid biosynthesis genes. in contrast, the mdmyb <dig> gene in this study strongly up-regulates expression of genes involved in anthocyanin and flavonol synthesis, including chs, chi, ufgt, ans, and fls genes. famyb <dig> contains a conserved c2-motif pdlnld/elxig/s at the c-terminal, which is responsible for repression of transcription  <cit> . the c2-motif is also present in the c-terminus of mdmyb <dig>  but its first amino acid sequence has been changed from phe to ser . it remains unclear if a single amino acid substitution is responsible for observed functional differences between mdmyb <dig> and famyb <dig> 

the apple mdmyb <dig> gene is also closely related to the maize zmmyb <dig> gene and the arabidopsis atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> genes. these three latter genes have been previously reported to function as repressors in the lignin biosynthesis pathway. for example, atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> down-regulate expression of c4h and comt genes, respectively, and are thus deemed as repressors of lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . it is likely that zmmyb <dig> inhibits transcription of comt, f5h, c3h, and 4cl genes, resulting in reduced levels of lignin biosynthesis  <cit> . thus, it has been presumed that mdmyb <dig> will have a similar function to those of its closely related genes. as expected, overexpression of mdmyb <dig> in tobacco flowers significantly represses transcription of genes involved in the lignin biosynthesis pathway such as c4h and 4cl2; moreover, it also severely inhibits expression of the cad gene involved in monolignol biosynthesis . however, expression of ntcomt in flowers of transgenic lines overexpressing mdmyb <dig> is significantly higher than that in wild-type plants . these results suggest that mdmyb <dig> may have functionally diverged from subgroup  <dig> myb genes such as those of atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> 

the apple mdmyb <dig> is involved in regulation of style development in pistils of flowers
it has been reported that changes in expression levels of atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> can influence pollen development by changing the flux of the phenylpropanoid pathway, and influencing composition of pollen wall  <cit> . for example, an atmyb <dig> insertion mutant of arabidopsis shows abnormal pollen grains that are either partially or completely devoid of cellular contents  <cit> . in this study, the subgroup  <dig> r2r <dig> family is also involved in the development of reproductive tissues. transgenic tobacco lines expressing mdmyb <dig> have developed flowers with longer peduncles and longer styles than those of wild-type flowers. of particular interest are those elongated styles as they result in stigmas that are positioned anthers of a flower. this suggests that mdmyb <dig> is also involved in the regulation of pistil development. similar observations have been previously reported for an antirrhinum ammyb <dig>  a homolog of mdmyb <dig>  <cit> . when ammyb <dig> is overexpressed in transgenic tobacco, elongated styles have been observed, resulting in protruded stigmas and contributing to infrequent self-pollination  <cit> . however, unlike morphological observations noted in this study, flowers of transgenic tobacco overexpressing ammyb <dig> are smaller in size and accumulate lower levels of anthocyanin than those of wild-type tobacco.

taken together, this study demonstrates that mdmyb <dig> plays important and multiple roles in plant growth and development. based on functional analysis of transgenic tobacco lines, overexpression of mdmyb <dig> in tobacco flowers enhances accumulation of anthocyanins and increases length of peduncles and more importantly lengths of styles.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a new r2r <dig> myb transcription factor , mdmyb <dig>  involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway was identified in the apple genome. this tf has been characterized and mapped onto linkage group   <dig> of the apple genetic map. transcripts of this tf are detected in leaves, flowers, and fruits; however, transcripts of mdmyb <dig> are higher in excocarp of red-skinned apple cultivars than that in yellowish-green skinned apple cultivars thus regulating accumulation of anthocyanin accumulation in the skin of apple fruit. ectopic expression of this tf in tobacco revealed that it has a regulatory role by activating the transcription of ntan <dig> and thus inducing several flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes. more interestingly, this tf is also involved in floral development by modifying pistil length in flowers.
