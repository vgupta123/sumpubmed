BACKGROUND
bacteriocins are a diverse group of gene encoded antibacterial agents including corpuscular bacteriocins, colicins, and microcins. while there is indirect evidence of presence of corpuscular bacteriocins in the genus escherichia  <cit> , they have not been unequivocally identified in this genus where only production of proteinaceous colicins and low molecular weight microcins has been directly demonstrated. both colicins and microcins have a relatively narrow spectrum of activity, predominantly comprising strains of the same species  and strains of the same and related species .

uropathogenic strains of e. coli  form a subgroup of extra-intestinal pathogenic e. coli  strains and cause human urinary tract infections . previous studies showed that there are several virulence factors associated with upec strains including adhesins, Î±-hemolysin and aerobactin production, cytotoxic necrotizing factor, and microcin v   <cit> . the colv plasmids  have been found to be associated with increased pathogenicity of e. coli strains  <cit> . the microcin v encoding gene, cvac, has been found more frequently in cases of pyelonephritis compared to cases of other clinically distinct uti infection syndromes, including cystitis and prostatitis  <cit> , suggesting a possible role for the genes located on the microcin v-encoding plasmids in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis. moreover, bacteremic isolates of e. coli strains were more often characterized by plasmid encoded microcin v production  <cit>  whereas in intestinal strains, microcin v was most often chromosomally encoded. nevertheless, there are contradictory results regarding the role of microcin v in bacterial virulence  <cit> .

bacteriocin production is an important characteristic of e. coli and several related species in the enterobacteriaceae family. within the genus escherichia, bacteriocin production is almost exclusively associated with strains of e. coli  <cit> . moreover, there is increasing evidence indicating that bacteriocins are important elements in bacterial ecology and are linked to their possible probiotic effects  <cit> . however, the precise ecological role of bacteriocins in microbial competitions among different bacterial populations in complex bacterial communities is not yet exactly known. the variability of bacteriocin types, different modes of molecular action, varying entry routes into susceptible bacteria, and the number of additional genes present on bacteriocin genophores are just some of the obfuscating factors. to date,  <dig> colicin types  <cit>  have been described in detail. in addition, nine microcin types have been analyzed on a molecular level allowing molecular detection of the corresponding genes  <cit> . to study the clinical and ecological importance of bacteriocin synthesis, detection of their specific types is needed due to their diversity and also due to the molecular diversity of the genes encoded on the plasmids or chromosomal regions in question. in this communication, we compare colicin and microcin types identified in two groups of e. coli strains isolated from healthy human guts and from human urinary tract infections.

RESULTS
detection system for  <dig> different colicin types
primers shown in additional file  <dig> were used to detect  <dig> colicin types and microcin c <dig>  the detection system for  <dig> additional microcin types including mb <dig>  mh <dig>  mj <dig>  ml, and mv was taken from gordon and o'brien  <cit> . with the exception of cloacin df <dig>  pesticin i, and bacteriocin 28b, this system is able to detect all colicin types so far characterized on a molecular level. all primer pairs were tested on all  <dig> established colicin type producers to detect cross-reactivity with other colicin types. cross-reactivity of the pcr amplification tests was observed in the following combinations: primers for colicin e <dig> gene also detected colicin e6; e <dig> primers also detected colicins e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> and e9; e <dig> primers also detected colicin e4; e <dig> primers also detected colicin e7; ib primers also detected colicin ia; colicin u primers also detected colicin y and vice versa and primers for colicin  <dig> also detected colicin  <dig>  identification of cross-reacting colicin producers therefore required sequencing of the corresponding amplicons, which was performed for all identified colicins e2-e <dig>  ia-ib, u-y, and 5- <dig> 

bacteriocin mono- and multi-producers among the control and uti strains
bacteriocin types identified in control and uti strains are shown in table  <dig> and statistically significant differences between bacteriocin producing and non-producing strains are shown in table  <dig>  in the uti e. coli strains,  <dig> bacteriocin producing strains  were identified among  <dig> tested. this incidence was not significantly different from bacteriocin producers in the control strains . mono-producers and strains producing two identifiable bacteriocin types  were similarly distributed among both uti and control groups . within bacteriocin mono-producers, reduced frequency of strains producing either colicin ia or ib was found . bacterial strains with  <dig> or more bacteriocin encoding determinants were significantly more common in the uti group . both uti and control strains showed a similar percentage of unidentified bacteriocin types , indicating the presence of, as yet, unknown bacteriocin versions or types in e. coli strains.

bacteriocin types in the control and uti strains
if the number of individual bacteriocin determinants in each group of producer strains was counted irrespective of the co-produced bacteriocins,  <dig> and  <dig> types were identified among the uti and control strains, respectively. colicins a, d, e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>   <dig> and microcin b <dig> were not detected in either group. in addition to these, colicins e <dig>  s <dig>  u,  <dig> and microcin l were not detected in the uti strains.

among the uti strains, there was a marked increase in the number of strains producing colicin e <dig> compared to controls . this increased incidence of colicin e <dig> encoding determinants was not associated with mono-producers or with double producers. however, in triple producers and multi-producers, this association was very strong compared to control strains . microcin h <dig> encoding determinants were found more often among uti strains compared to controls . majority of the microcin h <dig> encoding strains were mono-producers with higher incidence among uti strains compared to controls .

e. coli phylogroups and colicin production
all investigated strains were phylogenetically analyzed using triplex pcr  <cit> . there was a marked increase of the b <dig> genotype in the uti group compared to controls , and a decreased incidence of the a genotype . additionally, a higher incidence of the b <dig> phylogroup was found in the uti strains of male origin  compared with uti strains of female origin . distribution of producer and non-producer strains among e. coli genotypes is shown in table  <dig>  in the e. coli phylogroup b <dig>  the incidence of bacteriocin producing strains was significantly lower among uti strains when compared to controls.

**not statistically significant

the incidence of colicinogenic strains among all strains including both uti and control strains was higher in the phylogroup a  and d  when compared to b <dig> . in contrast, group b <dig> showed higher incidence of microcin-encoding strains when compared to strains of group a  and d . producers of microcin h <dig> belonged more frequently to group b <dig>  when compared to other bacteriocin producers  and less frequently to groups a  and b <dig> .

cole <dig> plasmids in multi-producer strains
strains producing the combination of colicins ia and e <dig> were more common in the uti group compared to controls  as well as strains producing bacteriocins ia, e <dig> and mv . to test whether these producers synthesizing colicin e <dig> contain regular low molecular weight pcole <dig> plasmids or only colicin e1-encoding determinants located on larger plasmids, the plasmid size of  <dig> colicin e <dig> producing strains, selected at random, was estimated using the southern blotting procedure with colicin e <dig> and colicin ia probes . most of these strains synthesized also colicin ia and microcin v. as shown by jeziorowski and gordon  <cit> , when colicin ia and microcin v co-occur, they are encoded on the same conjugative plasmid as a result of integration of microcin v operon and several other genes into the pcolia plasmid. as shown by southern blot analysis, all tested colicin e <dig> producers had low molecular weight plasmid dna recognized by colicin e <dig> probe with size ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> kb . to verify the pcole <dig> plasmid sizes, xl-pcr approach was used to amplify the entire pcole <dig> using complementary primers recognizing colicin e <dig> operon. in  <dig> out  <dig> samples, a successful dna amplification resulted in pcr product size ranging between  <dig>  -  <dig> kb . the colicin ia probe hybridized with a higher molecular weight plasmid dna  indicating that these strains harbor colicin e <dig> plasmids together with an additional bacteriocin-encoding plasmid.

discussion
a detection system for  <dig> different colicin types was designed and tested. together with previously published microcin primer set  <cit> , most of the well characterized bacteriocins in the genus escherichia can be identified. gordon and o'brien  <cit>  found  <dig> bacteriocin producing strains among  <dig>  human e. coli strains, whereas in our study, 55%  of e. coli control strains  were bacteriocin producers. gordon and o'brien detected eleven colicin types and seven microcin types. with the exception of microcin m , all types used in the published study  <cit>  were tested in the present work. since the identification scheme of bacteriocin producers, including indicator strains and cultivation conditions, differed in both studies, it is likely that the 17% difference reflects the primary identification of producer strains. in our study,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of strains in both control and uti strains, respectively, produced unidentified bacteriocins. appearance of inhibition zones, inducibility with mitomycin c and sensitivity to trypsin suggested that both colicin and microcin types could be expected among untyped producer strains. some of these strains possibly produce already known, though untested, colicin and microcin types . despite this fact, untyped bacteriocin producers represent an interesting set of e. coli strains needing further bacteriocin research.

both our groups of control strains  were nearly equal in the incidence of bacteriocin types. since the tributary areas of both hospitals overlap, similarity in incidence of identified bacteriocin types likely reflects the fact that all samples were taken from persons living in the same area of south moravia, czech republic.

no statistically important difference was found in the incidence of bacteriocin producers among uti strains  compared to control strains . this observation may reflect the fact that most uropathogenic strains originate in the human gut  <cit> . investigation of  <dig> clinical isolates of uropathogenic strains of e. coli collected in new zealand  <cit>  revealed lower incidence of bacteriocin producers ; an even lower incidence  was found among  <dig> e. coli uti strains tested in  <dig> in the czech republic  <cit> . in the latter case, only "rich media" were used for identification of bacteriocin producers, which could result in lower microcin detection in both uti and control strains .

commensal strains of e. coli belong mainly to phylogroups a and b <dig> whereas the group b <dig> contains highly virulent e. coli strains  <cit> . virulent e. coli strains are also often found in group d. e. coli strains in groups b <dig> and d have the largest genomes  <cit> . however, there is no exclusive link between e. coli groups b <dig> and d and the ability to cause infection since e. coli strains belonging to all groups can cause infection under specific conditions. the observed higher incidence of e. coli group b <dig> among uti strains, relative to group a, is therefore not surprising. we found that microcin h <dig> encoding genes are present predominantly in e. coli phylogenetic group b <dig>  since microcin h <dig> encoding determinants are localized on a bacterial chromosome  <cit> , microcin h <dig>  genes appears to be often part of genetic elements specific for group b <dig>  <cit> . our findings also suggest that colicin production is principally associated with e. coli phylogroup a  and not with genotype b <dig>  where microcin producers are more common. as suggested in previous publications  <cit> , our results support the model where the colicin producer phenotype, within the enterobacteriaceae family, belongs primarily to commensal intestinal e. coli strains.

we found a statistically significant increase in uti strains producing colicin e <dig> compared to controls . there was an especially strong association between triple and multiple bacteriocin producers and colicin e <dig> production - with p-values lower than  <dig> . in a previously published paper  <cit> , cole1-like plasmids were frequently found among uropathogenic strains of e. coli . however, no control group was tested to identify the statistical significance of this finding. among  <dig> identified bacteriocin producers, 43% were positive for moba-, rom- and rnaii-specific sequences  <cit> ; also, since other colicin plasmids may contain the same or highly similar sequences to pcole <dig>   <cit> , the exact extent of the colicin e <dig> producing subset is unknown. based on frequency of incidences of colicin e <dig> production in our study, the majority of producer strains described by rijavec et al.  <cit>  containing cole1-like sequences were probably strains harboring pcole <dig> 

in the group of uti strains, lower bacteriocin diversity and an increased number of triple and multiple producers were identified. the bacteriocin multi-producer phenotype of uti strains was predicted as one possible explanation of unidentified colicin types in a previous study  <cit> . in general, the multi-producer phenotypes require:  efficient genetic transfer within the bacterial community,  low habitat heterogeneity to ensure effective negative selection of sensitive bacteria, and  relatively low bacteriocin biosynthesis costs. as experimentally shown by braude and siemienski  <cit>  in rats, the first two conditions apply to urinary tract infections suggesting that the multi-producer phenotype is favored among upec strains. besides reduced habitat heterogeneity of the urinary tract compared to the human colon, the multi-producer strains could be more frequently found in uti infections because of additional virulence factors associated with bacteriocin encoding determinants. although the first explanation may also apply to the higher incidence of colicin e <dig> plasmids in the uti, it is unlikely that there are any additional virulence determinants on pcole <dig> plasmids besides the colicin e <dig> determinant itself. the size of previously published cole <dig> plasmids varied from  <dig>  kb  <cit>  to  <dig> kb in the e. fergusonii ef <dig> strain  <cit>  and contained regions important for plasmid replication, mobilization, and for colicin synthesis. no known virulence determinants have been identified on these plasmids. as shown previously, colicin e <dig> can kill both normal and cancer eukaryotic cells and this effect has been shown to be cell-specific  <cit> . the toxic effect of colicin e <dig> on uroepithelial cells could be one of the potential virulence mechanisms found in upec strains.

when compared to controls, producer strains with the combination of colicins ia, e <dig>  and mv were more common in the uti group. as shown by jeziorowski and gordon  <cit> , when colicin ia and microcin v occur together, they are encoded on the same conjugative plasmid as a result of integration of the microcin v operon and several other genes into the pcolia plasmid. therefore we tested whether similar integration of colicin e <dig> genes into the pcolia could explain the observed association of colicin e <dig> and colicin ia synthesis. among the  <dig> randomly picked colicin e1-synthesizing multi-producers, all strains contained pcole <dig> dna that was not recognized by the probe complementary to the colicin ia-encoding dna and vice versa, suggesting that pcole <dig> was independently co-associated with pcolia in uti strains. moreover, pcole <dig> sizes were similar to those published previously  indicating that the pcole <dig> dna is unlikely to encode any known virulence factor. this finding suggests that colicin e <dig> itself is a potential virulence factor of certain uropathogenic strains of e. coli. however, it is possible that strains carrying colicin e <dig> genes differ in their genetic content and contain elements promoting their urovirulence. since it is known that colicin e <dig> is independently associated with e. coli phylogroups  <cit> , the first explanation appears more probable.

CONCLUSIONS
e. coli strains isolated from human urinary tract infections showed increased incidence of microcin h <dig> and colicin e <dig> production, respectively, and belonged more often to phylogroup b <dig> when compared to control e. coli strains. in the uti group, producers of  <dig> or more identified bacteriocin types were more common. moreover, the incidence of colicin e <dig> production was high in the uti multi-producer bacteriocinogenic strains. unlike colicin ia- and microcin v-encoding determinants  <cit> , pcole <dig> was independently associated with pcolia in the uti strains. thus, colicin e <dig> itself appears to be a potentially important virulence factor of certain uropathogenic strains of e. coli.
