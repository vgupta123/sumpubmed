BACKGROUND
in autumn  <dig>  the a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> pandemic influenza vaccine was recommended as a priority to essential workers and high risk individuals, including individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus 
 <cit> . while previous studies of influenza vaccination in hiv-infected individuals showed no significant negative effects in the setting of effective highly active antiretroviral therapy 
 <cit> , the  <dig> h1n <dig> influenza a vaccination campaign was the first to use the aso <dig> adjuvant in the canadian population
 <cit> . the superiority of this oil in water adjuvant formulation of an influenza vaccine over non-adjuvanted formulations in enhancing vaccine antigen immunogenicity reduces the amount of h1n <dig> hemaglutinin  antigen required per vaccine dose
 <cit> . therefore, it was recommended for use by health canada in order to optimize vaccine efficacy and distribution in the canadian population
 <cit> . immunogenicity of vaccine antigens is enhanced by inflammation
 <cit>  and clinical trial data indicates an increased incidence of non-severe vaccine-associated adverse events following administration of the aso <dig> adjuvanted a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> vaccine  compared to non-adjuvanted influenza antigen formulations
 <cit> . these reported events were mainly symptoms of localized and systemic inflammation. frequency and severity of adverse events reported was similar for hiv-infected and uninfected individuals
 <cit> . acute systemic inflammation with leukocytosis and impaired endothelial cell function was observed in a group of hiv-infected individuals monitored after receiving a similar a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> vaccine formulation
 <cit> . thus, there is a high likelihood that this pandemic vaccine formulation induced stronger and/or more sustained inflammatory responses in the recipient population than those induced by previous seasonal influenza vaccine formulations. to obtain more information on factors affecting immunogenicity of arepanrixtm in the hiv-infected population, we performed a retrospective analysis of the vaccine responses of 80/ <dig> vaccinated individuals attending the provincial hiv clinic in newfoundland and labrador, canada. we used a sensitive microbead-based array assay to measure humoral responses and investigated baseline factors associated with vaccine immunogenicity. in addition, since inflammation and immune activation are risk factors for hiv disease progression, even in the setting of haart
 <cit> , we assessed whether primary vaccination with arepanrixtm had any adverse effect on cd4+ t cell numbers in this group of  <dig> vaccinated individuals.

RESULTS
changes in cd4+ t lymphocyte counts in vaccine recipients
general characteristics of  <dig> hiv-infected individuals, of whom  <dig> received and  <dig> declined the  <dig> h1n <dig> vaccine, are shown in table
 <dig>  of the vaccinated individuals, 63%  had plasma hiv viral loads below detectable levels , as did 67%  of the unvaccinated group. twelve vaccinated individuals were not receiving antiretroviral therapy at the time of vaccination and through the follow-up period. for the  <dig> vaccine recipients, the mean peripheral blood cd4+ t cell count ± sd pre-vaccination was 534 ± 277/μl and post-vaccination was 500 ± 266/μl. excluding those vaccinated individuals whose viral load changed by >  <dig> log <dig> over the observation period , the mean peripheral blood cd4+ t cell count ± sd pre-vaccination was 576 ± 268/μl pre-vaccination and 532 ± 261/μl post-vaccination. neither change was statistically significant . over a similar time period, the mean cd4+ t cell count of the  <dig> unvaccinated hiv-infected individuals  was 429 ± 235/μl initially and 418 ± 180/μl at the end of the observation period. there was no significant difference in the median change in cd4+ t cell counts between these groups over the autumn  <dig> through early winter  <dig> observation period whether the vaccinated individuals with a change in hiv plasma virus load of >  <dig> log <dig> were included  or excluded  versus  <dig>  iqr −21- <dig>  . the small size of the group declining the vaccine  precluded robust comparison of changes in cd4+ t cell numbers in inherently variable hiv-infected populations. therefore, we also compared median change in circulating cd4+ t cell numbers within the vaccinated group over the period 1–5 months from receiving the vaccine to median change in cd4+ t cell numbers over an equivalent time period approximately 1 year later. while the seasonal flu vaccine in  <dig> included a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig>  the aso <dig> adjuvant was not used. over the same time interval one year post a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> vaccination , the mean cd4+ t cell count of the h1n1-vaccinated group was 549 ± 283/μl initially and 573 ± 278/μl at the end of the observation period. there was no significant change in cd4+ t cell counts across this period . excluding  <dig> cases where viral load rose or fell by >  <dig> log <dig> over the observation period, the mean cd4+ t cell count of the h1n1-vaccinated group was stable at 584 ± 259/μl initially and 593 ± 259/μl at the end of the observation period. the median change in cd4+ t cell numbers over a 1–5 month interval spanning fall/winter 2010/ <dig> was significantly different from the median change in cd4+ t cell counts that occurred in the 1–5 month  immediate post a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> vaccination period. this was consistent whether the  <dig> cases in 2009/ <dig> and  <dig> cases in 2010/ <dig> where viral load rose or fell by >  <dig> log <dig> were included  or excluded from analysis . these data suggest that primary a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> arepanrixtm vaccination had a slight and transient negative effect on circulating cd4+ t lymphocyte numbers in the group of hiv-infected individuals studied. however, the effect was relatively minor compared to the overall variation in cd4+ t cell counts observed over the follow-up period. therefore, after measuring vaccine responses, we carried out a sub-analysis within the vaccinated group comparing the median change in cd4+ t cell numbers of responders to the median change in cd4+ t cell numbers of non-responders over the period 1–5 months from receiving the vaccine.

vaccine responses
in cases where pre-existing antibodies reactive with a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen were present , an increase of ≥  <dig> mfi units was considered a positive response. for those individuals without pre-existing antibody responses against a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha, an increase in mfi to ≥  <dig> was considered a positive vaccine response. consistent results were obtained with repeat testing of  <dig> pre- and post-vaccination sample pairs. applying the criteria stated above, 28/ <dig> individuals had pre-existing antibodies reactive with a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen, 36/ <dig>  hiv-infected individuals responded to the vaccine and 44/ <dig> were non-responders . twenty-two of the  <dig>  hiv-infected individuals with pre-existing antibodies against a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen responded to the vaccine compared to only  <dig> of the  <dig>  without pre-existing antibodies against a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen. thus, hiv-infected individuals with pre-existing antibodies against a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen were considerably more likely to respond to the vaccine . if some of those individuals with pre-existing antibodies were actually infected with a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen over the follow-up period for plasma collection, this could result in overestimation of the response rate in this group. a limitation in the retrospective design of our study was the variable timing in collection of post-vaccination plasma samples for analysis of anti- a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antibody responses.

comparison of responders and non-responders
there was no significant difference in mean age between responder and non-responder groups. however, as shown in figure
2b, responders without pre-existing antibodies against a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen had a lower mean age  than either responders with pre-existing antibodies  or non-responders . although there was a wide range of cd4+ t cell counts in both groups, the median cd4+ t cell count was significantly higher in the responder group than in the non-responder group . there was no significant difference in median cd4+ t cell nadir between responders and non-responders , nor between responders with or without pre-existing antibodies against a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen  respectively. median plasma hiv viral load at the time of vaccination was not significantly different between groups and several responders had relatively high plasma levels of hiv . the effect of multiple variables on vaccine response was assessed by stepwise logistic regression. age, gender, time since immunization, pre- and post-immunization cd4+ t cell counts, pre- and post- hiv viral load, and cd4+ t cell nadir did not independently affect response to influenza vaccine. pre-existing influenza antibody was the only predictor  of vaccine response in both univariate and multivariate analyses.

although the median loss of cd4+ t cells over the period 1–5 months from receiving the vaccine was significantly greater than over the same time period 1 year later, the effect was small relative to overall variation in cd4+ t cell counts. to test for specificity of the effect in relation to the effect of vaccination, we compared cd4+ t cell losses between hiv-infected vaccine recipients who exhibited an increase in anti-a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> antibodies and those who did not. our reasoning was that if cd4+ t lymphocyte counts were affected by the vaccine, the impact would be greatest in those making a measurable immune response against it. there was a significantly greater median loss of cd4+ t cells over the period from 1–5 months of receiving the a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> vaccine in the group of  <dig> individuals who responded to the vaccine compared to the  <dig> non-responders . results were similar when  <dig> responders and  <dig> non-responders whose hiv virus load changed by >  <dig> log <dig> over the observation period were excluded from analysis .

discussion
there was broad uptake of the pandemic a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha influenza vaccine in autumn  <dig> in both high risk and general populations. including the aso <dig> adjuvant in the formulation increased immunogenicity of the vaccine in the general population with no indication of severe adverse events, but there are few studies on the performance of the vaccine formulation in hiv-infected individuals. using a sensitive microbead-based array assay
 <cit> , we observed a low response rate overall in hiv-infected individuals , especially in those with little or no evidence of pre-existing antibodies against a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha . in contrast, the response rate was considerably higher in those subjects with pre-existing antibodies . responders had a higher mean cd4+ t cell count than non-responders and responders without pre-existing antibodies against a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha and were younger than the non-responders and responders with pre-existing antibodies against a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha. multivariate analysis did not indicate a difference in vaccine responsiveness, even when accounting for time since immunization.

these data indicate a predictable hierarchy of vaccine effectiveness in which youth, lesser evidence of hiv disease progression and previous sensitization all favour responsiveness. previous studies of this vaccine formulation in hiv-infected individuals reported response rates of > 65% using standard ha inhibition assays
 <cit> . although our assay format may be more sensitive
 <cit>  and identify a higher percentage of subjects with pre-existing antibodies, the response rate we observed overall was still considerably lower. the study cohorts with > 65% vaccine response rates were similar in terms of age, concurrent cd4+ t cell counts and extent of viral suppression below detectable levels. most subjects in our cohort were infected  <dig> or more years ago and thus, may have had lower cd4+ t cell nadirs than subjects in the other groups. another factor potentially contributing to the disparity in observed response rates is the different times after vaccination that vaccine responses were measured. a different, but comparable mf59-adjuvanted h1n <dig> ha vaccine induced similar antibody responses in hiv-infected and control study groups, but responses declined rapidly between  <dig> and 6 months post-vaccination in the hiv-infected group
 <cit> . another study with the mf59-adjuvanted vaccine reported seroconversion rates of only 36% in the hiv-infected study group, based on a minimum four-fold increase over baseline titer
 <cit> . these other studies used standards related to vaccine protection to assess seroconversion, which require development of an ha inhibition titer of ≥ 1/ <dig> or a fourfold increase over baseline titer. in contrast, we relied exclusively on a sizable increase in anti-h1n <dig> ab levels to indicate an immune response to the vaccine and to categorize recipients as responders or non-responders. as the microbead-based assay measuring mfi is more sensitive to changes in anti-h1n <dig> antibody levels than doubling dilution ha inhibition assays
 <cit> , this could influence a greater fraction of those with pre-existing anti-h1n <dig> ab to be categorized as responders. if the response is subject to more rapid decay in non-sensitized hiv-infected individuals, then the longer time period we waited prior to assessment of responsiveness could have influenced a greater fraction overall to be categorized as non-responders. obtaining samples systematically at earlier time points post vaccination could have changed our observed response rates. overall, our results and others’ indicate that a prime-boost approach with this vaccine formulation might be more effective than a single administration at generating protective antibody levels in the hiv-infected population
 <cit> .

another issue with use of this novel adjuvanted vaccine formulation in the hiv-infected population is the potential for adverse events associated with heightened or prolonged inflammation. while adverse events reported were primarily limited to localized pain, general fatigue and headache
 <cit> , we were struck by what appeared to be unusual declines in the cd4+ t cell counts of hiv-infected individuals within  <dig> to 5 months of receiving the vaccine. therefore, we compared changes in cd4+ t cell counts between vaccine recipients and non-recipients, between vaccine responders and non-responders and among vaccine recipients over the post vaccine period and a similar time interval 1 year later. while the number of vaccine non-recipients in our study group was too low for robust comparisons, we did observe a slight, but significant fall in the cd4+ t cell numbers of vaccine recipients over the period following vaccination  compared to over a similar time period 1 year later. the fall in cd4+ t cell numbers over the time period following vaccination was significantly greater in the group of  <dig> vaccine responders compared to the group of  <dig> non-responders. in  <dig>  the seasonal flu vaccine did include a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha, but was non-adjuvanted, suggesting the fall in cd4+ t cells observed post a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha vaccination might reflect increased inflammation due to the adjuvant. if so, it may be informative to monitor cd4+ t cell counts at earlier time points post vaccination as it is somewhat surprising the effect persisted over the 1–5 months between pre and post-vaccination cd4+ t cell measurements. again, our study was limited by its retrospective nature in that cd4+ t cell counts were not collected at completely systematic intervals relative to the timing of vaccination. differences in cd4+ t cell changes over the 2009/ <dig> interval compared to 2010/ <dig> could also relate to the effects of primary versus booster vaccination with the inactivated a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> ha antigen itself. a stronger effect might actually be anticipated upon secondary exposure, but with more rapid resolution. the effect on cd4+ t cells was slight relative to overall variation in cd4+ t cell numbers over the study period, raising some question as to its direct relationship to vaccination and biological significance. given the potential impact of infection with influenza, the minor and transient effect on cd4+ t cell numbers from the vaccine itself should probably not be a consideration for hiv-infected individuals
 <cit> . with the timing of plasma collection post vaccination, we cannot exclude the possibility that several individuals categorized as vaccine responders actually developed anti-a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> antibodies as a result of infection. however, we feel it is more likely the observed accentuation of the effect in responders reflects the action of vaccine components affecting immunogenicity and reaffirms the general notion that immune activation can contribute to viral replication and the pathogenesis of cd4+ t cell loss in hiv infection
 <cit> . definition of operative mechanisms linking inflammation to cd4+ t cell loss in this light may be more relevant to the general pathogenesis of hiv infection than to vaccine-related adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS
the response rate to the pandemic  <dig> aso3-adjuvanted a/california/07/ <dig> h1n <dig> vaccine arepanrixtm was 45%, 95% ci 34%-56% overall in a group of hiv-infected individuals followed in newfoundland and labrador and only 27%, 95% ci 15%-39% in those without pre-existing anti-h1n <dig> antibody responses. either a series of injections, reformulation or an increase in antigen content may be necessary to achieve desired response levels in this population
 <cit> . vaccine administration was associated with a minor, transient loss of cd4+ t cells, which was greater in vaccine responders. the small magnitude and limited durability of the loss compared to overall variation in cd4+ t cell numbers and in relation to risks associated with influenza infection itself, suggest it should not be an issue in recommending vaccination against influenza in the hiv-infected population, even with adjuvanted vaccine formulations. however, the cd4+ t cell loss could be an important illustration of the role immune activation plays in the pathogenesis of hiv infection. as such, confirmation of the effect and research towards understanding the underlying mechanism are desirable.
