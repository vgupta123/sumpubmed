BACKGROUND
previous bio- and phylogeographic studies in the northern hemisphere revealed the major role of the quaternary in the evolution of biodiversity. important climatic fluctuations resulted in alternations of glacial and interglacial periods that profoundly influenced the distribution of habitats, dispersal and isolation among populations . in south america, climate fluctuation periods were equivalent to those known for the northern hemisphere  <cit> . during the glacial periods, glacier boundaries descended hundreds of meters, and advanced dramatically in the southern part of the continent  <cit> . in the central andes, although late quaternary glaciations eliminated the material evidence of glacier advances older than  <dig>  <dig> years  <cit> , research has shown that the distribution of plant species and habitats cycled with climatic changes, descending to lower elevations during periods of reduced temperature  <cit> . however, studies on the influence of the quaternary on current south-american biodiversity are scarce and have usually focused on lowland regions  <cit> .

species with broad ranges of distribution can be informative regarding glacial refugia, dispersal pathways and contact zones  <cit>  and, then, provide useful insights about the role of climatic changes on biodiversity. the pampas cat  displays a large distribution in south america, from central ecuador to patagonia, in a variety of habitats  <cit> . based on morphological characteristics, between  <dig> and  <dig> subspecies are currently recognized  <cit>  and the scission of this taxon into three different species was proposed by garcía-perea  <cit> : l. colocolo for populations distributed on the western slope of the southern andes; l. pajeros distributed along the andes; and l. braccatus found to the east of the andes, in brazil, uruguay and paraguay. previous studies performed on mitochondrial genome  <cit>  also revealed that the andean pampas cat populations are genetically structured and may have experienced significant and lengthy periods of isolation and reduced gene flow.

in spite of its wide distribution, the pampas cat is one of the less known felids  <cit>  and its status is affected by a variety of threats, comprising habitat loss and fragmentation, hunting for traditional reasons and decline of prey populations  <cit> . lack of evaluation of its conservation status through its range causes the pampas cat to be considered as vulnerable  <cit>  and to be included in the iucn near threatened  category  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to link the genetic diversity of the pampas cat throughout the central andes to ancient climate fluctuations. to address this objective, the genetic structure of the pampas cat in  <dig> localities over a distance of more than  <dig> km was inferred with both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, using non-invasive sampling.

RESULTS
species identification and mtdna variability
a total of  <dig> skin samples and  <dig> faecal samples from  <dig> localities were analyzed . of the faecal samples,  <dig> were unambiguously assigned to pampas cats according to the mtdna 16s region. the remaining samples were assigned to andean cats leopardus jacobita , domestic cats  or canid species . a small number of faecal samples  failed to be amplified and could not be identified. all skins were assigned to pampas cats.

after the total number of pampas cat samples, number of skin samples is indicated in parentheses. number of individuals as identified from microsatellite data.

the length of two mitochondrial control region segments combined varied between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. two variable mononucleotide repeats 3– <dig> 3– <dig> were identified but not considered for the analyses. without considering the rs <dig> region composed of a variable number of large tandem repeats, the pampas cat hvs-i region contains between  <dig> and  <dig> bp . the range known for other felid species is 231– <dig> bp  <cit> .

sscp analyses revealed a single allele per sample, excluding the presence of mtdna sequences transferred into the nuclear genome   <cit> . the sscp survey of the  <dig> samples and the sequencing revealed a total of  <dig> hvs-i haplotypes and  <dig> variable sites. phylogenetic relationships inferred among these haplotypes were consistent for both nj and ml methods. the haplotypes clustered into four major clades, named hereafter a to d, strongly supported by bootstrap values . however, relationships among clades were not completely resolved.

sequencing of the nadh- <dig> and atp- <dig> genes revealed  <dig> sites of additional variation for the  <dig> individuals selected from our sample. these individuals were selected randomly, with the constraints of choosing individuals with different hvs-i haplotypes and covering all the major hvs-i clades. the phylogenetic tree inferred using both the nadh- <dig> and atp- <dig> genes was fully congruent with the one performed with hvs-i and allowed the four major clades to be recovered, while the resolution was lower. when individuals from previous studies  <cit>  were included into the present dataset, a total of  <dig> variable sites was detected for nadh- <dig> and atp- <dig> genes. most of these additional individuals clustered within clade b  and d   while individuals geographically distant from the andean region, located in central chile and brazil, formed two additional clades. interestingly, individuals presenting hvs-i haplotypes of the clades a and c formed two clusters not identified by previous studies.

individual identification and population diversity
microsatellite amplifications provided results for  <dig>  of the  <dig> pampas cat faecal samples and for the  <dig> skin samples  for a total of  <dig> samples. the microsatellites were highly variable, with 10– <dig> alleles per locus  and the probability of sampling two different individuals with the same genotype ranged between  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  unique multilocus genotypes were recorded for  <dig> faecal samples . however, in several cases, two or more samples displayed the very same multilocus genotype indicating that the same individual had been sampled several times. according to the low probability of obtaining the same genotype in different individuals, samples with the same genotype were assigned to a unique individual, providing a final sample size of  <dig> pampas cat individuals. the number of individuals per locality varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  except for  <dig> localities that had a sample size of  <dig> individuals or less . localities with sampling size lower than four individuals were not included in the following analyses, unless mentioned in the text.

the locality numbers correspond to those on the table  <dig>  mean values were calculated with the localities with more than  <dig> individuals only. total values were calculated for the entire sample. n = sample size; h = number of haplotypes; hd = haplotype diversity; s = number of polymorphic sites; p = percentage of variable sites; π = nucleotid diversity; k = number of alleles; he = expected heterozygosity.

the total number of alleles per population ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> , but was correlated to sampling size . the total number of alleles estimated for  <dig> individuals per population   <cit>  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , showing little variation between populations. the expected heterozygosity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   and was not correlated to sampling size . none of the localities displayed deviation from hw expectations, indicating that no more than one population was sampled per locality.

for the mtdna control region, the number of haplotypes per population ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and was also correlated to sampling size . haplotype diversity values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  between the sampled localities, and nucleotide diversity varied by one order of magnitude between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

population structure
the best value of the ln pr obtained with the program structure on microsatellite data corresponded to k =  <dig> population groups. these groups included the localities ,  and . relationships among populations inferred from the microsatellite data supported this grouping, although bootstrap values between populations 2– <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were low . amova analysis also supported this structure as the one displaying the highest variation among groups on either mitochondrial or microsatellite data .

analyses were performed on mtdna haplotypes using Φ-statistics or microsatellite data using rst-statistics and distances. localities with less than  <dig> individuals were not included.

the distribution of the groups of populations appeared to be clearly correlated to latitude . the first group occupies the area north to 18°s and is formed almost exclusively by individuals of the clade a. the second group, distributed between 20° and 23°s, presents a great proportion of individuals of clade c, although clades b and d are present too. the third group, distributed south to 25°s, contains principally clade d individuals, with some clade b and c individuals in its northern region. the northernmost and the southernmost sampled localities are represented by private haplotypes of the clades a and d, respectively.

including all localities did not modify the results provided by structure: ,  and   and the population structure remains strongly correlated to geography except for population  <dig>  while geography and mtdna data suggested including this population in the group , the microsatellite data suggested a closer affiliation with the southernmost group .

evolutionary and demographic history
based on the hvs-i sequences, the coalescence times of the clades , , and  were estimated to  <dig>  my ago ,  <dig>  my ago  and  <dig>   my ago respectively. interestingly, the radiation of the clades a, b, c and d occurred almost simultaneously, with coalescence times of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  my ago, respectively. the results for tamura-nei distances between clades, coalescence times and confidence intervals are presented in figure  <dig> 

discussion
genetic diversity
previous research has shown that pampas cats present a large genetic diversity at the species level  <cit> . results of the present study indicate that a large diversity is also present at populations level and that it is comparable to other non-endangered felid species, like the ocelot and margay  <cit> . although we reported a higher hvs-i genetic diversity for some pampas cat populations  than for those species   <cit>  this can be explained by bigger samples and the presence of highly divergent clades in the most diverse pampas cat populations .

genetic structure and geographic distribution
along the andean region, analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes revealed the presence of three groups of populations. these groups show a strong geographical structure, with latitudinal separations at 18°–20°s and 23°–25°s. including results of previous studies based strictly on mitochondrial dna indicated the existence of a fourth group in northern chile  <cit> , as well as the two groups out of the andean region, in brazil and central chile  <cit> . this genetic structure roughly corresponds to the distribution of morphological subspecies described by garcía perea  <cit> . two of the museum samples, both from locality number  <dig>  were identified as l. c. garleppi using the descriptions done by garcía-perea  <cit> , although it was not possible to directly assign a genotype to a morphotype for other localities due to the nature of the samples. however, according to the type localities of the described subspecies, the pampas cat groups can be equivalent to garleppi , budini , pajeros  and wolffshoni  subspecies .

the geographical location of populations  <dig> and  <dig> coincides with the subspecies steinbachi and crucinus, respectively, while population  <dig> is located between the supposed distribution ranges of thomasi and garleppi . these three localities are characterized by private hvs-i haplotypes or ncdna that differs from that of adjacent populations, and had samples of only  <dig> individuals. since a small sample size per locality can affect the results of the stucture program  <cit>  and other analyses, the correspondence between these localities and subspecies needs to be validated by further investigations. the further assignation of these localities to subspecies can be of conservation value since many authors  do not recognise steinbachi and crucinus as valid taxa. as this research focused in the central andean region, further research must be made to describe the genetic structure of the entire species.

the andean area between 18° and 23°s, approximately, corresponds to an extremely arid belt that separates a northern area, with summer rains, from a southern one, with winter rains  <cit> . this zone is considered to be a barrier between subspecies of other land mammals such as the vicuna vicugna vicugna  <cit>  and the lesser grison galictis cuja  <cit> , and represents a distribution limit for other species, like the long-tailed weasel mustela frenata  <cit> . in contrast, the genetic structure of the puma puma concolor from the high andes is not affected by this barrier  <cit> , probably due to a higher dispersal capacity. the pampas cat populations distributed between 18°s and 25°s display three different phenotypes  <cit>  and an important admixture of the clades typical of adjacent areas, suggesting the arid belt as a contact zone.

influence of pleistocene
the topology of the mtdna trees enabled us to infer two periods of prime importance for the demographic history of the pampas cat. the lack of resolution for the relationships between pampas cat clades  suggests a rapid radiation.

a first episode comprised the split of the clades a, b, c and d and occurred between the end of the bramertonian interglacial  and the beginning of the pre-pastonian glacial period . the pre-pastonian corresponds with the most extensive glaciations in southern south america  <cit> . this period also coincides with the estimated date of the divergence between the major clades of the andean bird genus muscisaxicola  <cit> , suggesting this period as an important phase in the diversification of the andean fauna.

the very similar coalescence times of the current haplotypes of the clades a, b, c and d suggest these events took place simultaneously, during a second demographic episode. these splits were likely to be the result of demographic expansions caused by geographically extended phenomena associated with climate change. the calculated mean time for these events overlapped the end of the kansan glacial period  and the aftonian interglacial , the interglacial period being the more likely moment of occurrence for these demographic events .

interestingly, the divergence time between clades a, b, c and d is similar or longer than between some felid species, such as the iberian lynx lynx pardinus, canadian lynx lynx canadensis and eurasian lynx lynx lynx , kodkod leopardus guigna, little spotted cat leopardus tigrinus andgeoffroy's cat leopardus geoffroyi  and ocelot and margay   <cit> .

high diversity within clades, times of divergence and monophyletic origin in most of the regions indicated long-term isolation into distinct refuges /regions  rather than dispersal from a unique refuge. no pleistocene refugia were previously identified in the central andes for medium-sized mammals. however, considering the current distribution of the clades and the zones apparently less affected by the glaciations  <cit> , clade a refuge probably existed in central peru, while clade b and clade d refuges were possibly located in northern chile and eastern argentina, respectively. clade c refuge was probably placed in eastern bolivia. individuals with haplotypes of clades b, c and d would subsequently migrate to a contact zone between  <dig> and 23°s during an interglacial period.

implications for conservation
the concepts of "evolutionarily significant units"   <cit>  and "management units"   <cit>  were created with the objective of targeting operational units for conservation below the species level. although the use of the esus concept and its importance for prioritising conservation efforts is currently well accepted, its definition was strongly debated  <cit> . many authors consider reciprocal monophyly as mandatory for the recognition of esus, as proposed by moritz  <cit> , or subspecies, while for other definitions a different evolutionary history between populations is sufficient  <cit> . mus, in the other hand, are defined as population units with statistically significant differences of allelic frequencies at nuclear or mitochondrial level  <cit> .

the long divergence time among clades, as well as the differentiation at the ncdna level, highlight the importance of recognizing the four pampas cat population groups identified here  as different units for conservation in the andean region. since they have different allelic frequencies at both, mtdna and ncdna levels, all of these groups must to be recognised as mus. in addition, we recommend the recognition of the localities  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as provisional mus, since only private haplotypes were found for them  or they differ at ncdna level from adjacent mus .

the existence of an admixture zone in the central andean region results in a lack of reciprocal monophyly between all the four population groups and makes their recognition as subspecies or esus controversial. however, cases of hybridization between subspecies or species are common in nature  <cit> , of particular interest being the identification of hybridization areas for tigrinas, geoffroy's cats and pampas cats  <cit> . in this sense, pampas cats from central andes can be regarded as a complex of at least four esus/subspecies, one of them being the result of a past hybridization event.

CONCLUSIONS
through the analyses of both mitochondrial and nuclear dna, we inferred the population structure of the pampas cat in a broad portion of the andean region, showing the existence of at least four groups of populations that must be considered different management units, and three other localities proposed here as provisional management units. the results revealed the influence of ancient climate fluctuations on the evolutionary history of this species, suggesting the split of four mtdna clades during the pre-pastonian glacial period, long term isolation and further population expansions during the aftonian interglacial. the pampas cat is a species with a relatively high mobility. it is expected that the other species of land vertebrates with a smaller or similar mobility have been affected in the same manner by the glacial and interglacial periods in the central andes and, hence, they show similar population structures at present, that should be considered for the future study and conservation of the andean fauna.
