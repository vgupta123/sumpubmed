BACKGROUND
an exciting challenge of biological research has been to understand phenotypic diversity within a species, which affects virtually every organ and cell type. in plants, this intraspecific diversity is often readily visible in the size, shape, color and number of flowers, fruits and seeds. diversity can occur in every region of the gene, in coding regions or in regulatory sequences including upstream promoter and enhancer sequences, 5' and 3' utrs and regulatory introns  <cit> . changes in regulatory regions affecting allele expression and transcript amount can be simple, such as small and large indels, or more complex, such as transposon insertions and structural rearrangements. molecular mechanisms responsible for the sequence modifications are replication errors, recombination and transposition. although the majority of allelic variation is due to nucleotide polymorphisms, phenotypic differences can be caused by epigenetic modifications such as dna methylation  <cit> .

sequence comparisons among inbred lines revealed that maize is a highly polymorphic species regarding genes and intergenic space  <cit> . consequently, maize lends itself to studying the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. as an example for a detailed allelic analysis, we chose the p <dig> locus, which maps to the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  for several reasons: 1) p <dig> produces a visible, quantitative phenotype in different tissues . it encodes a r2r <dig> myb-like transcription factor that activates the structural genes c <dig>  chi <dig> and a <dig> of the phlobaphene biosynthesis pathway   <cit> . phlobaphenes, which are reddish flavonoid pigments, accumulate in male and female floral organs. 2) the p <dig> gene is dispensable for the organism. loss-of-function or change-of-function alleles will not be eliminated from the gene pool. 3) the p <dig> gene is characterized by its tremendous allelic diversity. more than hundred p <dig> alleles with distinct spatial and temporal expression pattern are reported although only few are molecularly defined  <cit> . 4) approximately  <dig>  million years ago, the p <dig> gene arose as a tandem duplication of the p <dig> gene  <cit> . if the p <dig> gene is the older of the two, it probably is the orthologous gene copy to the p <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> because maize arose by allotetraploidization about  <dig> mya  <cit> . therefore, we also refer to p <dig> as ortholog and p <dig> as paralog. the p <dig> gene is not involved in phlobaphene pigmentation, but like p <dig>  is a qtl for maysin production   <cit> .

phlobaphene pigmentation is most readily visible in the pericarp, i.e. the outer layer of the kernel, and the cob glumes. traditionally, p <dig> alleles are phenotypically categorized and named based on expression in these tissues. the p <dig> gene designation is followed by a two-letter suffix that refers to pericarp and cob color, respectively. for instance, the p1-rr allele exhibits red pericarp and red cob glume pigmentation while the p1-rw allele has red pericarp and white or colorless cob glumes . each phenotypic p <dig> group may consist of structurally very different alleles. only few p <dig> alleles have been structurally determined of which only a small number has been completely or partially sequenced. p1-rr4b <dig>  <cit>  and p1-rw <dig>  <cit>  are single copy genes that both were introgressed into the inbred line 4co <dig>  this inbred line contains a loss-of-function p1-ww allele. p1-wr in inbred line b <dig> is a multi-copy allele, consisting of  <dig> p1-wr tandem repeats that are flanked by p2/p <dig> and p1/p <dig> hybrid genes upstream and downstream of the cluster, respectively  <cit> . a large retroelement cluster is inserted in the 3' utr of the p1/p <dig> hybrid gene.

the p1-ww alleles do not encode a functional p <dig> transcription factor; therefore pericarp as well as cob glumes are colorless . while loss-of-function alleles often result in deleterious or even lethal conditions for the organism, non-functional p <dig> alleles do not cause any impairment that would reduce the fitness of the mutant plant. the p1-ww alleles can vary in origin and structure. most of the structurally known p1-ww alleles are derived from p1-rr by transposon insertions and/or excisions. the p1-ww <dig> null allele, for example, arose from a transposon-induced recombination event between the  <dig> -kb direct repeats, which led to the deletion of the entire coding sequence  <cit> . however, the origin of p1-ww allele in the inbred line 4co <dig> is not known, but p1-ww is often used in genetic crosses. brink, for instance, introgressed more than  <dig> p <dig> alleles in the inbred line 4co <dig>  <cit> . knowledge of the p1-ww sequence could help clarify whether p1-ww is derived from p1-rr  <cit> , p1-wr  <cit> , p1-rw  <cit>  or even a different p <dig> allele and provide further insights into other intermediates of chromosomal rearrangements.

to shed light on the origin of p <dig> allelic variability, we analyzed here three p <dig> alleles in their chromosomal context, namely p1-ww, p1-rr4b <dig> and p1-rw <dig>  first we resolve the structural organization of these p <dig> alleles and their corresponding p <dig> alleles on the single-nucleotide sequence level. subsequently we compare their sequences also to the recently sequenced p1-wr cluster  <cit>  to find large and small scale nucleotide polymorphisms that enable us to infer mechanisms for genome rearrangements. in particular, we focus on evolutionary changes in p <dig> alleles that occurred in the putative distal enhancer region and in the 3' utrs.

RESULTS
the structural organization of p1-ww and linked p <dig> gene
a partial genomic lambda library was constructed using ecori-digested 4co <dig> dna. filters were screened with the probe p <dig> , which hybridizes to a distal enhancer region thought to be present in all p <dig> alleles at the time of p1-ww cloning. a lambda clone containing  <dig> -bp genomic dna was isolated and sequenced . interestingly, this sequence is  <dig> % identical to the displaced p1/p <dig> 3' utr and its 3' intergenic region, starting from an ecori recognition sequence in the retrotransposon opie, and ending in an ecori site in the retroelement shadowspawn .

the extensive similarity with the p1/p <dig> 3' end and intergenic region together with the identical shadowspawn insertion suggests that both sequences continue to be similar past the end of the lambda clone. to confirm this assumption, we extended the sequence by genomic pcr from the shadowspawn element to neighboring genes that are unrelated to p and therefore do not participate in potential p recombination events. pcr primer pairs were designed based on the equivalent p1-wr cluster, and pcr products were cloned and sequenced . the analysis of  <dig>  bp revealed that 4co <dig> and b <dig> are virtually identical in this sequence; they consist of the 3' end of the shadowspawn retroelement, a gene encoding a calmodulin-binding protein, part of a gene encoding a protein of unknown function, and intergenic regions . the calmodulin-binding protein, which in 4co <dig> measures  <dig> aa, is  <dig> aa larger than in b <dig> and also contains two amino acid substitutions due to  <dig> indels and  <dig> snps. based on maize and other est data, this gene is transcribed and is very conserved in grass species such as rice, sorghum and barley.

although we could not find any remnants of p <dig> in the 3' flanking regions, we also needed to extend the analysis to the 5' flanking regions. we knew that a functional p <dig> gene, as visualized in silk browning reactions, still had to be present. the browning reaction of freshly cut back silk correlates with silk maysin concentration and is therefore induced by both p genes  <cit> . to extend the sequences of p1-ww up to the p <dig> gene, we used a genomic pcr approach by taking advantage of existing p <dig>  p2/p <dig> and p1/p <dig> sequences for the primer design. we sequenced a total of  <dig>  bp that include the complete p <dig> and flanking sequences  . no p <dig> fragments or traces were detected. the p <dig> and p <dig> alleles with their flanking sequences are  <dig> % identical. they differ in  <dig> snps and multiple indels, of which the largest consists of a heartbreaker mite insertion of  <dig> bp in the second intron. because the  <dig>  bp coding sequences of the two duplicated genes only vary by one synonymous substitution each in exon  <dig> and  <dig>  their deduced p <dig> protein sequences of  <dig> aa are identical . rt-pcr experiments confirm that p <dig> is expressed in silk tissue as predicted by the silk browning reaction .

the sequence  <dig> bp downstream of the p <dig> stop codon is composed of a partial eninu retroelement of  <dig> bp followed by a ji retrotransposon, which covers the remaining  <dig>  bp of the available sequence . the 4co <dig> p <dig> allele differs from the b <dig> p <dig> sequences extracted from the p2/p <dig> and p1/p <dig> alleles in many snps and indels including transposon insertions, suggesting that p1-ww may not have arisen from p1-wr by recombination events in a direct lineage.

interestingly, the retrotransposons at the 3' end of p <dig>  namely eninu and ji, and at the 5' end of the above described "p1-ww" lambda clone, namely opie and eninu, are identical to the retroelement cluster of p1-wr in sequence, insertion site and consequently target site duplications. although we did not clone and sequence the complete retroelement cluster in p1-ww it is most likely that both clusters in 4co <dig> and b <dig> are identical, at least in their initial transposition of eninu and their nested insertions of ji and opie .

in brief, whereas p <dig> is present and functional in the 4co <dig> inbred line, p <dig> coding and regulatory sequences are missing with the exception of the distal enhancer region. the structure of the p1-ww allele does not unambiguously point to a single known p <dig> allele where p1-ww is derived from, although, mechanistically, unequal crossing over between flanking sequences of the p <dig> gene could have been involved as discussed below.

the structural organization of p1-rr4b <dig> and linked p <dig> gene
how does the sequence arrangement of p1-wr and p1-ww including their flanking genes compare to p1-rr4b <dig>  a p <dig> single-copy allele that produces red pericarp and red glumes? p1-rr4b <dig> contains two large repeats flanking the coding sequence, which are about  <dig>  kb in size  <cit> . interestingly, the sequence upstream of the 5' large repeat contains fragments of opie and eninu retroelements inserted in the same position as in p1-ww and p1/p <dig> as described above . likewise, eninu is bordered by the detached p 3' utr sequence of  <dig> bp. subsequently, p1-rr is highly similar to a single p1-wr copy with few exceptions: the upstream regulatory region is more complex in p1-rr than in p1-wr  and both sequences diverge shortly after the stop codon . by sequencing two plasmids, sa <dig> and pa <dig>  which contain the 3' large repeat and are derived from lambda clones used for the isolation of p1-rr 5' and coding sequences  <cit>  , we extended our p1-rr sequence analysis by  <dig>  bp past the 3' large repeat and into flanking genes . by aligning both large repeats we found  <dig> polymorphisms including the insertion of a transposable element of  <dig>  bp in the 5' repeat . this element is flanked by 8-bp direct repeats , which is typical for transposons of the hat superfamily. the 3' large repeat following the upstream regulatory sequence resembles p1-ww but does not contain the shadowspawn retrotransposon insertion . furthermore, the final  <dig>  bp of the plasmid insert, not related to p1-rr, are highly similar to the equivalent p1-ww and p1-wr sequences . the 3' flanking sequence contains one complete gene and one partial gene in opposite transcriptional orientation compared to p1-rr. the first gene, which is separated from p1-rr by  <dig>  bp , encodes the 4co63-type calmodulin-binding protein consisting of  <dig> amino acids. no more than  <dig> bp of intergenic sequence divide the first from the second gene, of which only the final two exons are present in the plasmid clone.

the p1-rr sequence analysis revealed that p1-rr is located between the retroelement cluster and the gene encoding a calmodulin-binding protein. most interestingly, the corresponding site in p1-ww and p1-wr is empty, i.e. this region does not contain a p <dig> gene copy . based on the first maize p <dig> allele that was isolated from a line which contains the p1-ww <dig> allele  <cit>  we assume that a functional p <dig> allele of p1-rr4b <dig> is present upstream of the retroelement cluster because p1-ww <dig> and p1-rr4b <dig> are both derived from the same allele. furthermore, the p <dig> allele ends in eninu and ji retroelement fragments exactly like p <dig> and p1/p <dig> suggesting structural similarity among these alleles. therefore, we decided to extend our sequence analysis to the p <dig> allele that is linked to p1-rr4b <dig>  we used the same genomic pcr strategy as described above to clone and sequence  <dig>  bp of p <dig> . indeed, the alignment of p <dig> with p <dig> showed no snps but only four 1-bp indels that are not part of exons or putative regulatory sequences. hence both p <dig> alleles are coding for an identical p <dig> protein . as expected, p <dig> is also flanked by eninu and ji retroelement sequences. introgression of p1-rr4b <dig> in 4co <dig> probably included p <dig> as well because p <dig> differs from p <dig> 

the structural organization of p1-rw <dig> and linked p <dig> gene
the p1-rw allele specifies red pericarp and colorless cob glumes . in general, the structure of p1-rw <dig> resembles p1-rr4b <dig>  <cit> . p1-rw <dig> is a single-copy gene, which consists of a coding region flanked by two  <dig> -kb direct repeats . the coding sequence of p1-rw <dig> is chimeric in nature. while the 5' utr is similar to p <dig>  the remaining coding region and adjacent eninu and ji retroelements  are p2-like   <cit> . sequence alignments establish that the p <dig> fragment is more closely related to p2/ than to p <dig>  interestingly, the ji retrotransposon is followed by a truncated p1-wr-like exon, which is not included in the p1-rw <dig> transcript. this organization of sequences suggests that p1-rw <dig> originated from a gene conversion event between p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . the p1-rw <dig> sequence upstream of the 5' large repeat is very similar to the corresponding p1-rr4b <dig> region, suggesting that both alleles occupy the same chromosomal location. we confirmed this by pcr-amplification and sequencing of a  <dig> -bp fragment that connects the 3' large repeat of p1-rw <dig> with the gene encoding the calmodulin-binding protein. p1-rw <dig> was introgressed in 4co <dig>  and indeed the 3' end of the intergenic region between the 3' large repeat and the neighboring gene is indistinguishable from 4co <dig>  since p1-rw <dig> and p1-rr4b <dig> occupy the same chromosomal position we wanted to find out whether the similarity extends to the region upstream of the retrotransposon cluster . we performed genomic pcr as described above to amplify and subsequently sequence  <dig>  bp  that are  <dig> % identical to the p <dig> sequence. the  <dig> snps and  <dig> short indels, which are distributed over a consensus sequence of  <dig>  bp, are not included in the p <dig> coding sequence and consequently do not alter the p <dig> protein sequence . the polymorphisms between p <dig> and other p <dig> alleles suggest that this p <dig> sequence was introgressed together with p1-rw <dig> into the 4co <dig> background. this implies that the p <dig> part of p1-rw <dig>  which is p2-like, is derived from a p <dig> source other than p <dig>  the p <dig> 3' sequence is also flanked by eninu and ji retroelement fragments, linking p <dig> to p1-rw <dig> across the retrotransposon cluster .

in summary, while p <dig> alleles can be located on both sides of the retroelement cluster , complete p <dig> alleles have so far only been found upstream of the retroelement cluster.

evolution of a putative distal enhancer by non-homologous end-joining and transposition
because all known p <dig> alleles produce almost identical p <dig> proteins , differential expression of p <dig> alleles could have evolved through changes in regulatory sequences, which control time-and tissue-specific p <dig> expression  <cit> . sequences containing regulatory elements are only determined for p1-rr  <cit> , but based on sequence similarities have likely the same function in other p <dig> alleles as well. while all known p <dig> alleles share the p1-rr promoter and proximal enhancer sequences, they differ in the sequence arrangement that contains the distal p1-rr enhancer. comparing putative distal enhancer regions of p <dig> alleles reveals that the single p1-wr gene carries the simplest and therefore possibly the most ancestral form, which is confirmed by the presence of an almost identical enhancer region at the 3' intergenic region of the p <dig> gene in a wild relative of maize   <cit> . complexity of this chromosomal region increased with p1-rw <dig> and then p1-rr4b <dig>  therefore, we can use the changes in sequence organization to explain the origin of the p1-rw <dig> and p1-rr4b <dig> enhancer region within the p1-wr repeat context, where the 3' end of one copy equals the 5' end of the downstream copy.

p1-rw <dig> is a complex allele that must have been shaped by multiple recombination events   <cit> . interestingly, the sequence following the p <dig> portion resembles the junction of two p1-wr copies in a head-to-tail arrangement, suggesting that p1-rw <dig> arose from p1-wr-like tandem repeats. the sequence similarity between p1-rw <dig> and p1-wr starts with the truncated exon  <dig>  p1-rw <dig> and p1-wr are identical until they diverge  <dig>  bp after the truncated p1-rw <dig> exon  <dig>  the next  <dig> bp of p1-rw are of mixed origin and mostly unrelated to p1-wr. p1-rw continues its homology with p1-wr 3' of the 734-bp insertion, but not at the sequence where both alleles deviate from each other. instead, the p1-rw sequence downstream of the insertion is identical to the region of p1-wr upstream of the insertion, i.e. the insertion is flanked by a 203-bp repeat sequence. the sequence after the point of divergence originated from an unknown mu-like transposable element  in reverse orientation . based on blastn searches, the sequence consists of two mule fragments that in a putative autonomous mule would be separated by approximately  <dig> bp . while the initial  <dig> bp, starting with the tir , are derived from the mule 3' end, the remaining 446-bp fragment stems from a sequence partially encoding the c-terminus of the mule transposase. the final  <dig> bp  of the 734-bp insertion may represent filler dna . the 9-bp fragment is identical to a p1-wr sequence, which is located  <dig> bp downstream of the point of p1-rw <dig> and p1-wr alignment. filler dna, which is usually found at repair sites of dna double-strand breaks can be simple as described here or complex, consisting of a patchwork of multiple sequences. filler dna is associated with non-homologous end-joining and is usually derived from nearby sequences of either end of the break  <cit>  .

p1-rr is structurally more complex than p1-rw <dig> and a single p1-wr gene. p1-rw <dig> and p1-rr contain the same mule fragments and filler dna inserted in exactly the same sequence position. however, a  <dig> -kb duplication in p1-rr that partially includes the fragmented mule suggests that p1-rr is derived from p1-rw <dig>  this duplication results in the addition of a fourth exon, which is unique to p1-rr. a closer look at the p1-rr 3' utr may help to shed light on the evolution of the p1-rr enhancer region .

whereas p1-rw <dig> and p1-rr are identical in the initial 3' utr, they diverge  <dig> bp following the stop codon. the next  <dig> bp  in p1-rr originated from two separated p1-rw <dig> sequences,  <dig>  bp apart, implying a deletion event in p1-rr compared to p1-rw <dig>  the 13-bp  insertion in p1-rr can be assigned to p1-rw <dig> sequences upstream and downstream of the deletion site. ataattggg is duplicated  <dig> bp downstream and includes the first two bp of the mule tir. obviously, the adjacent tcac occurs frequently within the p1-rw <dig> sequence. however, the closest tcac can be located  <dig> bp upstream of the insertion site. the 13-bp p1-rr sequence subsequent of the point of divergence with p1-rw <dig> is suggestive of filler dna, indicating that a previous dna double-strand break in p1-rw <dig> was restored by the nhej pathway. a tandem duplication of  <dig>  bp that comprises the majority of both mule fragments and 3' flanking enhancer sequences generated the current p1-rr 3' end and enhancer region.

in summary, dna double-strand breaks in a p1-wr-like tandem array were probably repaired by nhej events that could have resulted in the rearrangements and duplications of enhancer-carrying sequences and consequently in novel p <dig> alleles as discussed below.

the p alleles differ in their 3' utrs and polyadenylation sites
although p <dig> and p <dig> share nearly the same coding sequences, their downstream sequences vary remarkably . sequence alignments of p <dig> and p <dig> alleles revealed that the p1-rr4b <dig> and p <dig> divergence from p1-wr is caused by transposon insertions. in p1-rr4b <dig>  a mu-like element was placed  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codon probably due to a deletion event , and p <dig> alleles are followed by an eninu retroelement  <dig> bp after the stop codon. the insertion sites close to the stop codon raise the question whether these transposable elements eliminated the transcription termination signals and the polyadenylation sites in the p1-rr4b <dig> and p <dig> 3' utrs. in general, the 3' utr is also important for post-transcriptional regulation such as micrornas and translational control, and gain or loss of cis elements within the 3' utr could contribute to allelic diversity. therefore, we decided to map the polyadenylation sites of these alleles.

the p1-wr coding sequence is not flanked by transposons, and its 3' utr probably represents the original 3' utr structure of all p alleles before transposon modifications. we performed 3' race experiments to identify the p1-wr 3' utr using three different gene-specific primers  and three independent pericarp tissue sources. rna was extracted  <dig> days after pollination  from plants that contain the p1-wr cluster. since the combination of different primers and tissues gave the same result we merged the data sets as shown in figure 4a. interestingly, we detected  <dig> polyadenylation sites in p1-wr that are spanning  <dig> nt from  <dig> to  <dig> nt after the stop codon. however, 36% of transcripts are polyadenylated  <dig> nt after the stop codon. the p1-wr cluster consists of  <dig> p1-wr tandem repeats and a p2/p <dig> hybrid gene that differ by few polymorphisms in their transcribed regions. as these  <dig> polyadenylation sites are not specific for a particular repeat, the polymorphisms apparently do not affect the polyadenylation signals.

rt-pcr results indicated that p <dig>  p <dig> and p1/p <dig> are expressed in silk tissue. accordingly, we carried out 3' race experiments using total rna from silk and three different primers , which hybridize to exon  <dig> of p <dig>  the rnas extracted from p <dig>  p <dig> and p1/p <dig> lines produced almost identical results with all pcr primers, which allows us to combine the data for ease of presentation . we found  <dig> polyadenylation sites in a 218-bp interval that is located between  <dig> and  <dig> nt past the p <dig> stop codon. whereas seven minor polyadenylation sites  are upstream of the retrotransposon,  <dig> sites lie within the ltr, including the major site , which is  <dig> nt from the stop codon and  <dig> nt into the ltr. the sequence alignment between p <dig> and p1-wr shows that the main polyadenylation site of p1-wr is  <dig> bp past the point of p <dig> and p1-wr divergence. the equivalent p <dig> fragment was displaced by retroelement insertions, and therefore cannot serve its original function. nevertheless, p <dig> was able to recruit alternative polyadenylation signals and sites located mostly in the eninu ltr.

subsequently, we performed 3' race experiments on p1-rr4b <dig> total rna extracted from silk and one primer binding  to exon  <dig>  this exon contains the 3' utr of the alternatively spliced p1-rr4b <dig> transcript, which encodes the functional p protein. we sequenced significantly fewer clones compared to p1-wr and p <dig> and obtained fewer polyadenylation sites. while polyadenylation sites are distributed over  <dig> nt from  <dig> to  <dig> nt measured from stop codon, the first site is used most often  . all seven polyadenylation sites are located in the mule fragments, two within the tir, the remainder in the transcribed part. due to the partial deletion of the former 3' utr alternative polyadenylation signals and sites had to be employed from adjacent sequences as described above. note that the mule borders p1-rr4b <dig> in opposite transcriptional orientation. a transcript from an intact member of the same mule family could therefore produce antisense rna that is complementary to p1-rr4b <dig> mrna.

discussion
models for the evolution of p <dig> alleles
a distinguishing feature of the p locus is its tremendous allelic diversity, which makes it a preferable locus to study evolutionary changes and chromosomal dynamics on a larger and smaller scale. although the grass family arose by an ancient whole genome duplication  event  <cit> , the p gene has only a single ortholog in rice and sorghum, indicating that one copy was lost from the paleoploid ancestral genome. however, the more recent allotetrapolidization event, which formed the ancestor of maize about  <dig> mya  <cit> , gave rise to two p copies located in the homoeologous regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the copy on chromosome  <dig> was then duplicated in tandem  <dig>  mya, thereby evolving into the current p <dig>  and p <dig>  genes  <cit> . the bulk of retrotranspositions in most grasses occurred more recently. a series of nested insertions that split approximately  <dig> bp of the p 3' utr occurred between  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya  <cit> . although retroelements are highly repetitive in the genome, insertions of retroelements in a nested fashion create unique sequence junctions and become chromosomal markers  <cit> . however, we do not know whether the retroelements transposed into the paralog or ortholog repeat, or maybe even into a later-generated copy. a model proposed for the evolution of single-copy alleles states that the retroelement insertion occurred in the 3' utr of p <dig>  thereby separating p <dig>  which turned into p1-rr and p1-rw  <cit>  . in contrast, transposition into the 3' utr of p <dig> retains the repeat structure and allows the amplification of additional copies by unequal crossover as suggested for the evolution of the multi-copy p1-wr allele  <cit>  . theoretically, only few recombination events are needed to transfer p <dig> and p <dig> sequences across the retroelement cluster. therefore multi-copy alleles in a tandem array could have been created upstream, downstream or on both sides of the cluster simultaneously. these intermediate structures that enable us to discover the step-by-step evolution of all p alleles might still exist in the maize germplasm. our current analysis allows us to present new and refined models for the evolution of p1-ww, p1-rr4b <dig> and p1-rw <dig> 

models for the evolution of p1-ww
p1-ww is a null allele because p <dig> specific sequences such as coding-, promoter-and proximal enhancer sequences are absent in 4co <dig> . is it possible that p1-ww represents a haplotype where the tandem duplication of the ancestral p gene never took place? according to this hypothesis, the nested retroelement insertions in 4co <dig> that are identical to alleles containing p <dig> and p <dig> sequences must have happened before the p duplication event. however, since the p duplication occurred  <dig>  mya,  <dig>  million years before the first retroelement insertion, we can disregard this possibility  <cit> . thus, the alternative explanation that a functional p <dig> allele was deleted to give rise to p1-ww is more likely. the p1-ww structure does not reveal the functional p <dig> allele and their deletion or recombination events that resulted in the current null allele. considering that p <dig> alleles are located on both sides of the retroelement cluster, multiple recombination events could have occurred to create the p1-ww allele.

one possible scenario for the origin of p1-ww in inbred line 4co <dig> is that the null allele, which carries a functional p <dig>  is derived from p1-wr. while unequal crossover among repeat sequences can lead to an increase of copy numbers, the alternative outcome is a reduction of repeats. during the evolution of the p1-wr allele, unequal crossover between the flanking genes of the cluster, namely p2/p <dig> and p1/p <dig>  could have caused the deletion of all p1-wr repeats, and would still have generated a functional p <dig> gene . however, p <dig> in 4co <dig> differs by various snps and indels from the corresponding p2/p <dig> and p1/p <dig> sequences of p1-wr, indicating that p1-wr might not be the immediate progenitor for p1-ww.

p1-ww also could have evolved by a recombination event that involved two different p <dig> alleles. unequal crossing over between p <dig> of p1-rr4b <dig> and p1/p <dig> of p1-wr could have generated the current p1-ww structure and could have restored the p <dig> copy . even then, the deletion of the original paralog would have been derived from the p1-wr allele. nevertheless, this could not have happened recently  because of sequence polymorphisms in the participating alleles. interestingly, both p1-ww and p1-wr carry as a signature the shadowspawn retroelement in the same position, indicating that p1-ww most likely derived from p1-wr in multiple steps.

in addition, we can envision a p1-rw-like allele, which is similar to p1-wr in the distal enhancer structure. such a p1-rw allele has been described  <cit> . an unequal crossover between the large repeats flanking the coding regions duplicates the p <dig> gene or deletes the coding sequences, resulting in the p1-ww structure . this scenario resembles the origin of p1-ww <dig>  <cit> . however, this model does not directly account for the shadowspawn retroelement in p1-ww. all models demonstrate the complexity of the p locus and reveal the countless possibilities for recombination to occur whenever paralogous sequences are present.

model for the evolution of p1-rw <dig> and p1-rr4b <dig>  with focus on regulatory sequences
despite the repeat structure of the p1-wr cluster, a single p1-wr copy has the least complicated p <dig> allele composition, followed by p1-rw <dig> and then p1-rr4b <dig>  we hypothesize that p1-rw <dig> originated from a p1-wr-like tandem array  because p1-rw <dig> comprises a sequence fragment downstream of the p <dig> section that is virtually identical with the junction sequence of two p1-wr repeats in a head-to-tail assembly. this p1-wr tandem array could have been located on either side of the retroelement cluster.

a plausible sequence of events is as follows. a mu-like element inserted into one of the p1-wr repeats  <dig>  bp after exon  <dig> of the previous copy. then an aberrant transposition event  of this mule caused a dna double-strand break that enabled exonucleases to digest the unprotected dna ends  thereby extending the gap into the adjacent p1-wr repeat. the deletion would have included mule sequences  and almost the entire length of a p1-wr repeat . non-homologous end-joining  <cit> , copying a 9-bp sequence  that is located  <dig> bp downstream from the deletion endpoint, must have repaired the break. due to the nature of tandem repeats, the large deletion described above results in small repeats of  <dig> bp that are flanking the mule fragments. interestingly, this duplication is part of a  <dig> -kb sequence that contains the enhancer element of p1-rr.

a single p1-wr-like allele downstream of the retroelement cluster that is flanked by large repeats due to the retroelement insertion in p <dig> could have been converted into a tandem array by unequal crossover between the large repeats . gene conversion events then could have transferred the altered region that originated at the 3' large repeat to the 5' large repeat where the distal enhancer sequence functions  <cit> . alternatively, p1-rw <dig> arose from p1-wr repeats upstream of the retrotransposon cluster. the sequence 3' of this cluster, which corresponds to the 3' intergenic region of p <dig> as found in the p1-wr cluster and p1-ww, is nearly identical with the 5' end of a p1-wr repeat over a stretch of  <dig>  kb . due to this sequence similarity, a recombination event between p1-ww and the proposed p1-rw <dig> precursor could have occurred that positioned p1-rw <dig> downstream of the retrotransposon cluster . this arrangement assumes that the p1-rw <dig> allele resembles p1-ww at the 5' end. after the recombination break point, p1-rw <dig> has to be closer to p1-wr because, based on our model, p1-rw <dig> is derived from p1-wr. indeed, a sufficient amount of polymorphisms between the p1-ww and p1-wr alleles enables us to verify the predicted structure and to place the possible recombination site between  <dig> and  <dig> bp after the point of p1-ww and p1-wr alignment. further recombination/gene conversion events contributed to the evolution of the present p1-rw <dig> allele.

the presence of the mule fragments and filler dna in p1-rr in exactly the same sequence context as in p1-rw <dig> agrees with our model that p1-rr continued to evolve from p1-rw <dig>  in our model for the origin of p1-rr, we propose a second dna double-strand break  that occurred in p1-rw <dig> in between the stop codon and the mule insertion . in contrast to the first dsb, there is no evidence for the participation of a te, leaving the cause for the dsb unknown. exonuclease activities expanded the gap until both ends were joined in a nhej fashion by synthesizing two short dna pieces  from sites close to the deletion end points into the repair site. the dsb repair caused a deletion of  <dig>  bp across the repeat junction that spanned almost the entire sequence from the stop codon to the mule fragments. interestingly, this intermediate p1-rr structure can be found at the 3' end of p1-rr <dig>  p1-rrcfs <dig> and p1-rwcfs <dig>  <cit> .

the 5' transposon fragment happened to contain an 8-bp sequence close to the tir  that is present  <dig>  bp further downstream as well. unequal crossover between those  <dig> bp resulted in a tandem direct duplication of this  <dig>  bp sequence. accordingly, the final  <dig> bp of exon three, being part of the repeat, were replicated, too. a sequence at the 3' end of the first repeat was adopted as a splice acceptor site thereby generating a fourth exon. although alternative splicing of exon  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> has been reported, the protein product is of unknown function or may not have any function at all  <cit> .

this putative evolutionary pathway explains how the p1-wr 3' utr was almost entirely replaced by a mule, how the fourth exon unique to p1-rr was generated and how the  <dig>  bp sali fragment containing the p1-rr distal enhancer was nearly completely duplicated . subsequently, gene conversion events could have placed part of the modified enhancer sequence of the downstream copy to the upstream large repeat  <cit> . alternatively, if this p1-rr module arose on the p1-wr side of the retroelement cluster as we also discussed for p1-rw <dig>  then a recombination event between p1-ww and the p1-rr ancestor could have transferred the p1-rr end to a position downstream of the retrotransposon cluster . the crossing over took place in the  <dig> bp sequence between the duplicated mules, which is why the repeat structure of p1-rr at the 5' end differs from the 3' end whereas they are identical in p1-rw <dig>  lastly, a  <dig>  kb hat-like transposable element inserted  <dig> bp upstream of the mule or  <dig> bp 5' of the enhancer region. this transposition did not occur in p1-rr <dig>  <cit> . taken together, the novel distal enhancer structure of p1-rr could be the result of a mule insertion and excision, deletion and repair by nhej, and duplication and deletion by recombination. this series of events from p1-wr to p1-rr confirms the sequential model of p1-rw and p1-rr evolution based on phylogentic analysis  <cit> .

function of the enhancer region rearrangements on p <dig> expression
when the p <dig> paralog was formed, it probably included the complete p coding sequence and the basal promoter that controls p expression in silk tissue. then the paralog acquired two additional regulatory sequences adding equally to the basal expression in pericarp and glume. the enhancer sequences were identified and tested in transient and transgenic plants using p1-rr fragments fused to a gus reporter gene  <cit> . a 1-kb sequence adjacent to the promoter contains a regulatory sequence termed proximal enhancer while a  <dig> -kb fragment further upstream includes a distal enhancer . the proximal enhancer region corresponds mostly to a truncated mule that captured part of a host gene in between the tir  <cit> . the proximal enhancer region and the basal promoter sequence are virtually identical in all sequenced p <dig> alleles to date . in contrast, the distal enhancer region varies in all p <dig> alleles as described above. therefore, we hypothesize that the different spatial and temporal expression patterns of p <dig> alleles are caused by distinct distal enhancer regions  <cit> . the distal enhancer as defined in p1-rr is located within a  <dig> -bp sali fragment  <cit> , out of which  <dig> bp are derived form the mu-like transposon . although this mule fragment is missing in p1-wr, transgenes constructed from p1-wr upstream regulatory sequences linked to p1-rr cdna produced red pericarp and cob glumes in transgenic plants  <cit> , indicating that the enhancer sequence is included in the 589-bp region downstream of the mule. since this 589-bp region is duplicated in p1-rr, p1-rr has two enhancer sites that are separated by the mule fragment. additional p1-rr alleles, namely p1-rr <dig> and p1-rrcfs <dig>  were shown to have the same enhancer structure as p1-rr4b <dig> with exception of the missing hat insertion in p1-rr <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the hat transposable elements inserted in the upstream copy of the enhancer region of p1-rr4b <dig> and p1-rrcfs <dig> obviously do not disrupt the enhancer sequence and function. compared to p1-rr, p1-rw <dig> has a deletion of  <dig> bp in the upstream repeat, which causes the loss of cob glume pigmentation  <cit> . interestingly, two additional p1-rw alleles, p1-rwcfs <dig> and p1-rwcfs <dig>  lack the entire upstream repeat and the mule fragment, thus having the identical enhancer arrangement as a single p1-wr copy  <cit> . taken together, the analysis of three p1-rr and three p1-rw alleles revealed that p1-rr alleles contain two copies of the specific enhancer sequence while p1-rw alleles only have one  <cit> . interestingly, this region coincides with a tissue-specific dnase i-hypersensitive site that remains closed in pericarp tissue of p1-pr, a silenced epiallele of p1-rr4b  <cit> ; the p1-pr phenotype is shown in figure 1a. it was reasoned that the upstream enhancer repeat that is missing in p1-rw <dig> controls the glume-specific expression in a position-dependent manner, since the identical enhancer region is located  <dig> bp further downstream  <cit> . an alternative explanation was prompted by the fact that p <dig> expression in pericarp is weaker and delayed in p1-rw <dig> compared to p1-rr. we hypothesize that the transcriptional strength of p <dig> alleles is correlated with the enhancer copy number, which is supported by similar findings in human upstream enhancers  <cit> . consequently, p1-rw <dig> produces less p <dig> protein than p1-rr in all expressing tissues. also, each p <dig> allele is not expressed uniformly in female and male floral tissues within a plant. for example in p1-rr, p <dig> transcription is usually higher in pericarp than in cob glumes  <cit> .

therefore, we propose that the presence of only one distal enhancer site in the p1-rw <dig> allele results in weak expression in pericarp tissue but no expression in cob glumes. due to the duplication of the enhancer sequence as outlined in our model, p <dig> transcription in pericarp and glume tissue was equally elevated such that p <dig> is strongly expressed in pericarp and weakly expressed in glumes, thereby giving rise to p1-rr alleles. note that comparisons with p1-wr alleles are not appropriate due to their post-transcriptional silencing, which potentially is repeat induced  <cit> . this model is supported by an analysis of the spatial expression pattern in transgenic plants where various p <dig> constructs were expressed only in few p expressing tissues, resembling p1-rr or p1-rw phenotypes. it was shown in these transgenic plants that p <dig> expression follows a spatial hierarchy that begins with pericarp and continues with cob glumes, husk, silk, and tassel glumes in decreasing order  <cit> . for instance, if the transgenes had been expressed in only one tissue, then it would have had to be in pericarp, in the case of two tissues then in pericarp and glumes, and so on.

the p alleles differ in their 3' utr
polyadenylation is involved in many facets of mrna metabolism including enhancement of mrna stability, transport of mrna from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and regulation of mrna translation. although polyadenylation signals in plants are less conserved than in mammals  <cit> , three signals were identified in maize, rice, and arabidopsis: the far upstream element , the near upstream element  and the cleavage element   <cit> . as we have shown above, a fragmented mule was placed adjacent to the p1-rr4b <dig> stop codon possibly due to a nhej event. all mapped polyadenlation sites of the p1-rr4b <dig> transcript are located within the mule sequence, indicating that p1-rr4b <dig> successfully recruited alternative polyadenylation signals in the transposon. similarly, a mu insertion in the 3' utr of the rf2a locus also resulted in the adoption of new polyadenylation signals and sites  <cit> . retroelements, the most common transposons in maize, also insert in 3' utrs without disrupting polyadenylation as demonstrated above for the p <dig> alleles. our results suggest that polyadenylation in maize is a highly dynamic process which despite its importance for the cell is not tightly regulated. the large amount of polyadenylation sites found in our analysis of p1-wr transcripts that do not contain a transposon insertion supports this conclusion. a genome-wide analysis of genomic and transcript data could shed light on the mechanism of polyadenylation in maize and could establish the proportion of genes that terminate in transposable elements. interestingly, it has been shown that many polyadenlylation signals in human and mouse genes have been derived from transposable elements  <cit> . besides polyadenylation signals, transcriptional as well as translational regulators have been identified in the 3' utr of plant and animal genes, and their gain or loss could cause allelic diversity. for example, targets of micrornas are often located in 3' utrs  <cit> .

gene copying events promote allelic diversity
recombination is crucial for the evolution of genomes  <cit> . in particular, the non-homologous recombination pathway is frequently used to repair dna double-strand breaks in somatic plant cells  <cit> . previously, we reported a probable nhej event involved in the formation of the p1-wr cluster  <cit>  that produced a hybrid gene due to the ligation of deletion end points located within two genes. similarly, deletions and repair by nhej in the above mentioned alleles could have resulted in the restructuring of an enhancer region and formation of a novel 3' utr.

the exceptional allelic variation at the p locus prompts the question about its similarities and differences to genes that exhibit less variation. we propose that the main cause for the diversity might lie in tandem gene amplification  <cit> . once a gene underwent an initial tandem duplication, multiple unequal recombination events can follow as seen in the p1-wr multi-gene cluster  <cit> . a single crossing over or gene conversion event between misaligned paralogous gene copies can generate many new alleles including deletion and amplification derivatives. interestingly, in plants such events can occur mitotically and can be transmitted into the next generation, thereby increasing allelic variation  <cit> . this explanation then implies that other loci exhibiting an increased allelic variation are multi-copy genes as well. indeed, the complex r <dig> locus in maize is analogous to p <dig> in many aspects. the r <dig> locus, which also encodes a transcription factor, confers bluish anthocyanin pigmentation to various vegetative and floral plant tissues. two r <dig> alleles, r-st and r-r, are molecularly well characterized. r-st contains various r <dig> genes, four of which are in tandem orientation  <cit> . r-r consists of one complete and three truncated r <dig> genes that originated from tandem duplication  <cit> . comparable to p <dig> in complexity, both alleles undergo recombination and transposition events creating numerous derivative alleles. paralogous gene copies in maize were also found at the pl <dig>  <cit>  and a <dig> loci  <cit> . especially the prolamine gene family with nearly  <dig> copies distributed over several chromosomes exemplifies the outcome of gene duplications  <cit> . actually, a large proportion of genes are tandemly duplicated in arabidopsis, rice, and maize  <cit> . considering the amount of paralogous sequences and their possibilities to recombine, a single reference genome providing just one allele can obviously not reflect this allelic potential of the maize genome. not surprisingly, a recent genomic comparison between the b <dig> and mo <dig> inbred lines  <cit>  revealed a large quantity of copy number variations and presence/absence variations confirming previous results  <cit> . nonetheless, epialleles remain invisible in a traditional sequence comparison. allelic diversity studies as presented here are essential for our understanding of the remarkably dynamic maize genome.

CONCLUSIONS
allelic diversity is the source for evolution and domestication. while allelic variation in wild species ensures the best possible adaption to changing environmental conditions, humans have profited from allelic pools in crop plants by selecting phenotypic variations that best meet their needs. alleles differ most often in small-scale nucleotide polymorphisms but also in large-scale sequence rearrangements. maize has been shown to be a highly polymorphic species well suited to study genome dynamics and the underlying molecular mechanisms. in particular, the maize p locus with its well-established genetic history offers a tremendous amount of ancient allelic variations, some representing intermediate steps in large-scale sequence rearrangements. the tandemly duplicated p <dig> and p <dig> genes encode virtually identical myb-like transcriptional activators, but only p <dig> controls the accumulation of reddish flavonoid pigments in maize female and male floral organs. because all p <dig> proteins are almost identical, the phenotypic variation must be due to p <dig> regulation. therefore, this locus represents an ideal example of how genomic rearrangements can contribute to novel regulatory elements.

here, we used targeted genome sequencing to apply comparative genomics to the maize genome. sequence alignments of orthologs and paralogs of different genotypes of a single genomic region allow us to reconstruct the repair of double strand breaks from transposition events within gene copies and their flanking regions. such drastic invasions of new sequence elements in flanking regions result in the de novo creation of regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression that differentiate gene copies in their function. interestingly, sequence chimerism in the 3' untranslated portion of the mrna gave rise to multiple poly-a addition signals with similar strength, indicating a more relaxed sequence restriction of the 3' processing machinery than previously believed.
