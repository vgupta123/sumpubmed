BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  can differentiate into chondroblasts, adipocytes, or osteoblasts under appropriate stimulation  <cit> . adult rabbit mscs  are an important source for tissue repair and therapy in regenerative medicine  <cit> . therefore, expanding the osteogenic capacity of rmscs is of major interest for improving the osteogenic potential of rmscs for optimal bone regeneration  <cit> . the osteogenic differentiation of mscs is characterized by the appearance of timely expressed genes, such as runt-related transcription factor  <dig>  alkaline phosphatase  and type i collagen, followed by extracellular matrix mineralization  <cit> .

phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase /protein kinase b  signaling pathways are activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli and regulate a wide range of cellular processes, including cell motility, survival, proliferation, and cell cycle progression. recent studies showed that the activation of pi3k/akt is involved in cell survival and axonal outgrowth in neurons  <cit> . mechano-growth factor  has been found in many tissues. it reportedly displays a neuroprotective effect in cerebral regions that were exposed to ischemia and is expressed in stromal cells of the eutopic endometrium and in glandular cells of the ectopic endometrium. in recent years, increasing attention has been paid to mgf because of its regenerative effects on neurons, human mesenchymal stem cells, and osteoblasts  <cit> . in addition, tissue-protective actions of mgf have been demonstrated in acute myocardial infarction, neuron damage, and rabbit bone-defect models  <cit> .

here, we used mgf to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying msc osteoblast differentiation and enhance the osteogenic potential of rabbit mscs. our data revealed that mgf through pi3k/akt signaling pathways trigger osteogenic differentiation of rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells.

RESULTS
identification of rmscs
the morphology of the rmscs was determined using a microscope . at day  <dig>  cells reached 80% confluence. at day  <dig>  the cells displayed a uniform spindle shape and reached 100% confluence. to further identify the rmscs, cd <dig> and cd <dig> cell markers were examined. immunofluorescence staining indicated that the cd <dig> cell marker fluoresced green on the cell surface under a fluorescent microscope, whereas cd <dig> fluoresced brown , indicating that cultured cells were positive for cd <dig>  but negative for cd <dig> .figure  <dig>

the proliferation of the cells for the second through the fifth cell passages was analyzed with an automated microplate reader at an absorbance of 570 nm on days 1– <dig>  as shown in figure 1c, the growth curves for the passaged cells displayed “s” shapes, with the latent growth phase of the passaged cells stabilizing during the first to second days. the cells from the fourth and fifth passages were 100% confluent at 7 days and then entered a lag phase. however, the cells from the second and third passages entered the lag phase 2 days later. thus, the cells from the fourth passage displayed the greatest ability to proliferate .

mgf receptor expression in rmscs
to detect the expression of mgf receptor in rmscs, we used immunocytochemistry techniques, and figure  <dig> shows mgf receptors expressed in rmscs. mgf expressed in the cytoplasm.figure  <dig>

optimal mgf concentration and application time for mgf-induced effects on rmscs
the optimal mgf concentration and application time for the mgf-induced effects on the rmscs were determined. figure  <dig> shows the growth rates of rmscs from the fourth cell passage for 1– <dig> days following the addition to the cell culture media of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 75 ng/ml of mgf. the maximum growth rate appeared at an mgf concentration of  <dig> nm between days  <dig> and  <dig> figure  <dig>

mgf promotes the growth and differentiation of rmscs via the pi3k/akt pathway
to identify the signaling pathway through which mgf acts on rmscs, cells were treated with  <dig> nm of mgf for 5 days , and the phosphorylation states of akt and mtor were examined at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 16 h following treatment on day  <dig> . figure 4b shows that the phosphorylation of akt and mtor increased. to further explore the function of mgf, the expression levels of alp and ocn were examined in the osteoblasts that were formed from the rmscs. the expression of these two proteins was higher at 4 h that at other time in cells treated with  <dig> nm mgf for 4 h on the fifth day of treatment .figure  <dig>

to verify that mgf promotes the growth and differentiation of rmscs via the pi3k/akt pathway, the pi3k/akt inhibitor ly <dig> with 20 μmol/l was used to inhibit pi3k/akt activity . following the addition of ly <dig>  the cells were treated with mgf for 1– <dig> days, and their growth rates were compared with those of cells that did not receive ly <dig> treatment . we found that the phosphorylation of mtor was decreased compared with that of controls . the inhibition of pi3k/akt also blocked the ability of mgf at  <dig> nm to increase the growth rate of rmscs, even after 10 days of treatment. in addition, the expression levels of alp and ocn were decreased compared with those in control osteoblasts .figure  <dig>

discussion
finding mechanisms that trigger the growth and osteogenic differentiation of rmscs may help develop novel therapeutic approaches to promote bone formation  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrated that mgf promoted the growth rate and osteogenic differentiation of rmscs via the pi3k/akt pathway.

the identity of rmscs were verified by their morphology and the finding that the rmscs expressed cd <dig>  a marker of rmscs, but not cd <dig>  a closely related molecule that does not label rmscs. cellular proliferation following the second through fifth passages was analyzed on days 1– <dig> following the passages. the fourth generation rmscs showed the greatest capacity for proliferation, whereas the second generation showed the weakest.

we determined that the maximum growth rate of rmscs was achieved by the addition of  <dig> nm mgf to the culture medium for 5 days. we also demonstrated that the mgf receptor is expressed at high levels in rmscs.

to gain further insight into the mechanisms through which mgf promotes growth and differentiation in rmscs, we evaluated the activity of the signaling pathways downstream of the mgf receptor. the pi3k/akt/mtor signaling pathway plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes, including cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metabolism, differentiation, and survival  <cit> . the results of our present study suggested that mgf promoted the growth of rmscs via the pi3k/akt signaling pathway. we found that 4 h on the fifth day of mgf treatment was required to stimulate maximal phosphorylation of akt and mtor and maximal expression of alp and ocn. furthermore, inhibiting akt with ly <dig> suppressed the mgf-mediated promotion of growth and osteogenic differentiation in rmscs.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our study suggests that the mgf receptor signaling pathway accelerates growth in rmscs primarily through a pi3k/akt-dependent pathway. despite this promising finding, further study is necessary before any clinical applications can be considered.
