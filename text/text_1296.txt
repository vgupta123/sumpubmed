BACKGROUND
the eps homology  domain is an evolutionary conserved protein interaction module originally identified as a tandem repeat of approximately  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus of the proteins eps <dig> and eps15r  <cit> . when functional information is available, eh-containing proteins are often implicated in regulation of protein transport and membrane traffic  <cit> , in actin cytoskeleton organization  <cit>  and in tyrosine kinase signaling pathways  <cit> .

screening with a multivalent nonapeptide phage display library has identified peptides containing an npf  motif as the preferred ligands of eh domains  <cit> . while the tripeptide motif is essential for binding, flanking amino acids contribute to modulate binding affinity  <cit> . a more detailed characterization of several eh domains, by phage display, has revealed that some eh domains may also bind to peptides characterized by different motifs  <cit> . the npf-containing peptides are designated class i peptides; class ii peptides are characterized by trp-trp , phe-trp , or ser-gly-trp  consensus sequences while the eh domain of the yeast protein end3p binds class iii peptides containing the his-ser/thr-phe motif  <cit> . however, till now, no class ii or class iii motifs have been found to be involved in eh domain recognition in physiological processes.

the structures of five different eh domains have been determined  <cit>  and the molecular and structural bases of their binding to class i peptides have been elucidated. the eh domains are formed by two closely associated helix-loop-helix motifs connected by a short antiparallel β-sheet. comparison of the amino acid sequences of different eh domains indicates that the structurally critical residues involved in the packing of the hydrophobic core are highly conserved throughout the family  <cit> . binding to the npf motif is mediated by a conserved hydrophobic pocket formed by leu <dig>  leu <dig> and trp <dig> in the second eh domain of eps <dig>  mutations in leu <dig> and trp <dig> were shown to abolish the binding to npf-containing peptides  <cit> .

pob <dig>  was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening as a novel interactor of ralbp <dig> , a putative effector protein of ral  <cit> . the single eh domain  is located at the n-terminus of pob <dig>  and it is responsible for the interaction with epsin and eps <dig>  <cit> , while the c-terminal region has two prolin-rich motifs , which associate with the sh <dig> domain of grb <dig> and with pag <dig>  <cit>  and a coiled-coil structure that maps inside the region involved in the interaction with ralbp <dig>  <cit> .

interestingly, the eh domain of pob <dig> can bind eps <dig>  a protein which lacks npf motifs or other eh-binding motifs . in particular, the pob <dig> binding-region maps between amino acids 504– <dig>  <cit>  and it contains  <dig> dpf  motifs. it has been observed that the eh domain of reps <dig>  a protein related but not identical to pob <dig>  can bind to a peptide containing a dpf motif  <cit> ; furthermore, cupers and collaborators reported the presence of tetramers of eps <dig> and suggested that they might be stabilized by low-affinity interactions between the n-terminal eh domains and the dpf carboxy-terminal region  <cit> .

the dpf region of eps <dig> on the other hand, by binding to the n-terminal "appendage" region of the ap- <dig> component α-adaptin, is also involved in its recruitment to sites of coated pit assembly  <cit> .

in the present work, we have investigated the molecular basis of the unconventional binding specificity of the pob <dig> eh domain. by screening a multivalent nonapeptide phage display library, we have shown that this domain can bind to both npf- and dpf-containing peptides. moreover, we have mapped the region of eps <dig> responsible for the interaction with the eh domain of pob <dig> and compared it with the binding sites for the α-adaptin subunit of the ap- <dig> complex. in addition, we suggest that also the eh domain region of eps <dig> associates with the dpf region, albeit with lower affinity, thus supporting its involvement in the stabilization of eps <dig> tetramers.

finally, based on the nmr structures of both eh domains, we have hypothesized that lysine residues, distal to the binding pocket, are potentially involved in the interaction with eps <dig>  altogether, these results show that the peptide recognition specificity of the eh domain of pob <dig> differs from other eh domains since it interacts with both npf- and dpf-containing sequences; these unusual binding properties could be attributed to a different conformation of the binding pocket that allows to accommodate negative charges.

RESULTS
the eh domain from pob <dig> binds to npf- and dpf-containing peptides
to investigate the binding specificity of the pob <dig> eh domain, we expressed it as a fusion to glutathione s-transferase  and used it to screen a random nonapeptide phage-display library as previously described  <cit> .  <dig> clones surviving three panning cycles were further tested by phage elisa. the  <dig> phages passing this second test display one of  <dig> different peptides,  <dig> of which contain a conventional eh binding motif  . the remaining  <dig> phage clones display the same peptide containing a dpf motif . the elisa assay shown in figure  <dig> compares the differences in binding affinities between all the selected peptides.

thus, differently from eh domains whose recognition specificities have been described so far, the pob <dig> eh domain binds also to a peptide containing a dpf-motif. furthermore, the selected peptide has a second negatively charged residue at position + <dig> , at variance with the known sequence preferences of eh domains, which dislike negatively charged residues at the positions flanking the npf tripeptide  <cit> .

finally, when all the selected npf peptides are considered together no strong preference can be identified in the positions immediately preceding or following the npf motif, suggesting that the eh domain of pob <dig> is less selective when compared to other eh domains described in the literature. this is confirmed by elisa experiments carried out with purified peptides .

pob <dig> binds dpf motifs in eps15
the results so far indicate that the pob <dig> eh domain can bind dpf peptides displayed on filamentous phage and suggest that this novel binding specificity could be responsible for the recognition of the eps <dig> c-terminal domain. to map the eps <dig> sequences responsible for binding to pob <dig> we expressed as gst fusions progressive cooh-terminal  deletions of the region spanning amino acids 623– <dig> of mouse eps <dig>   <cit> . agarose-immobilized gst-eps <dig> fusion proteins were tested in a pull-down assay carried out on 293phoenix cells over-expressing full-length pob <dig> fused to the myc epitope. the results reported in figure 3b indicate that the binding of the pob <dig> eh domain to the c-terminal region of eps <dig> is influenced in a complex manner by the length of the region. shortening of the  <dig> amino acid dpf rich fragment initially results in negative modulation of binding ; further shortening, however, restores efficient binding. a c-terminal fragment  is also capable of binding. these results are compatible with the presence of at least two different binding sites with fragment length affecting conformation and, as a consequence, availability of dpf motifs for eh binding.

in order to confirm the eh targets inferred by the pull down experiment, we synthesized the full-length human eps <dig> protein as  <dig> amino acid long peptides, overlapping by  <dig> amino acids, using the spot synthesis method  <cit> . the membrane was incubated with the eh domain of pob <dig> fused to gst and probed with an anti-gst antibody . the results are partially in agreement with the conclusions drawn from the pull-down experiments. pob1_eh binds to dpf peptides in the regions 623– <dig>  and 647– <dig> ; these findings are consistent with the pull down results as the sequences  and  are also present in the c and d constructs . in addition, two more regions, both containing dpf peptides and encompassing respectively amino acids 592– <dig>  and 796– <dig>  also associate to pob1_eh domain. however, both regions, which may contribute to stabilize binding, are outside the fragments used in the pull-down experiment. finally, the spots encompassing the sequence of the n construct in the gst pull-down fail to associate with the eh domain.

by combining the results from pull down and the pepspot experiments we conclude that many dpf peptides have the potential of binding the eh domain of pob but most of the eps <dig> binding determinants are included in the fragment encompassing amino acids 623– <dig> and containing five dpf motifs. furthermore, the two n-terminal dpf peptides included in the region from d <dig> to d <dig> are sufficient to promote binding to pob1_eh. finally, the results suggest that some of the determinants involved in this interaction might promote a conformation necessary for binding without being involved in the establishment of contacts or, as an alternative, they could act as recognition sites for other binding partners which promote the association.

cupers and collaborators proposed that eps <dig> forms a head to head dimer and that two dimers further associate head to tail to form a tetramer  <cit> . the tetrameric head to tail structure suggests a possible interaction between the eh domains at the n-terminus of eps <dig> and the c-terminal tail which contains  <dig> dpf repeats.

to test this hypothesis, we expressed as gst-fusions the n-terminal region of mouse eps <dig> and we compared it with the eh domain of pob <dig> in a pull-down experiment:  <dig> μg of purified molecules bound to glutathione-sepharose beads were incubated with  <dig> mg of cell extract from hek <dig>  bound proteins were resolved by sds-page and analyzed by western-blotting using an anti-eps <dig> antibody. the result shown in figure 5a confirms that both the pob1_eh domain and the n-terminal region of eps <dig> associates to full length eps <dig>  a similar experiment was carried out with the isolated gst-eh domains  indicating that the association is mediated by the n-terminal eh domain  of eps <dig> .

in order to provide further evidence for the interaction of eps <dig> with the n-terminal eh domain, we performed a pull-down assay using recombinant deletion constructs of eps <dig>  spanning the dpf region. the gst fusions were incubated with a hek <dig> cell extract. affinity purified proteins were resolved by sds-page and analyzed by western-blotting using an anti-eps <dig> antibody to identify endogenous eps <dig>  the result  shows an association that involves dpf triplets at the c-terminal end of eps <dig>  although these experiments don't definitively prove a direct dpf/eh interaction in eps <dig>  as we cannot exclude the involvement of accessory proteins, they confirm a plausible role of eh-dpf interaction in the stabilization of eps <dig> tetramers, as suggested by other authors  <cit> .

lysine residues distal to the binding pocket are involved in pob <dig> eh/dpf interaction
nmr studies of the eh <dig> domain of eps <dig>  combined with mutational analysis, have identified a patch of hydrophobic residues  accommodating the proline in the npf ligand . residues gly <dig>  val <dig> and gly <dig> delineate the edge of the binding pocket where they may contribute to eh recognition specificity. finally, the side chains of lys <dig> and glu <dig> are positioned to form a sort of gate flanking the binding groove  <cit> . it has been suggested that the electrostatic repulsion from the negatively charged side chains in the gate structure may prevent the interaction with a peptide containing an aspartate in place of the asparagine of the npf motif.

the eh <dig> domain of eps <dig> contains a similar hydrophobic binding pocket as the eh <dig> domain  <cit>  delimitated by residues ala <dig>  leu <dig>  ala <dig>  gly <dig> and trp <dig>  while lys <dig> and asp <dig> form the gate of the pocket .

the corresponding residues in the pob <dig> eh domain are arranged differently  <cit> , thus designing a groove with different properties . some residues such as phe <dig> and ala <dig>  are less exposed to the solvent, moreover, the side chain of lys <dig>  points toward the pocket, partially occluding it. kim and co-workers determined the solution structure of the eh domain of reps <dig> and characterized its binding to different peptides. based on fast exchange binding analysis, they observed that residues in reps <dig> corresponding to trp <dig>  glu <dig> and ser <dig> of pob <dig> do not shift upon addition of a dpf-containing peptide despite these residues showing the largest changes on binding npf. furthermore, the addition of dpf peptides affects resonances of residues that are distal to the primary interaction site . in pob1_eh the residue corresponding to gln <dig>  is close to ile <dig> and proximal to a positively charged surface patch formed by lys <dig> and lys <dig> .

these observations could indicate that the topology of the pob1_eh complex bound to a dpf-containing peptide differs somewhat from the topology of a corresponding complex hosting a npf peptide. starting from this hypothesis, we investigated the contribution to eps <dig> binding of the molecular surface of the pob1_eh domain as defined by the side chains of residues ile <dig> and phe <dig> and by the positive patch formed by lys <dig> and lys <dig> in the interaction with eps <dig>  to this end, we designed four pob1-eh mutant domains containing an ala side chain at position k <dig>  k <dig>  and f <dig> respectively. a mutant in the conserved tryptophan  was also added as a control since this residue was already proven to be involved in npf recognition. when tested in a pull down assay, mutants k312a, k351a and the double mutant k312a-k351a, similarly to w324a, have lost their ability to bind eps <dig> . by contrast f344a still binds eps <dig>  a similar result was also obtained when the mutants were tested in an epsin <dig> pull down, although pob1_eh binds epsin <dig> npf motifs .

taken together these results suggest that the eh domain of pob <dig> associates with peptides containing npf and dpf motifs and that residues that are distal to the previously defined binding pocket may be involved in this recognition.

finally, the structural analysis  shows that the eh <dig> domain of eps <dig> contains a hydrophobic crevice located in analogous position to the one analyzed by point mutations in the pob1_eh domain. leu <dig> and val <dig> constitutes the hydrophobic core of the pocket while tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> are partially solvent exposed and form the edges finally two positively charged residues, lys <dig> and arg <dig>  surround this groove while arg <dig>  contiguous to tyr <dig>  locates the charged guanidinium group toward the centre of the pocket extending the bottom surface. interestingly, whitehead and collaborators  <cit>  assert that the mutation of the three tyrosine residues tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  and tyr <dig> of meh <dig> in eps <dig> abolishes its mono-ubiquitination upon stimulation of the cells with egf, indicating a clear functional role of this region in the regulation of eps <dig> 

even if not supported by a mutational analysis, these observations permit to suggest that also for this eh domain residues, distal to the primary interaction site, could be responsible for the eh/dpf interaction and for the "unconventional" recognition specificity.

discussion
eh-domain-containing proteins and their interaction partners form a network involved in endocytic transport  <cit> . they play regulatory roles in endocytic membrane transport events and in actin dynamics. pob <dig> has been involved in cell migration and receptor endocytosis for its binding the paxillin-associated protein pag <dig>  <cit>  and for its interaction with ralbp <dig>  a gtpase-activating proteins  for the gtp binding proteins rac <dig>  cdc <dig> and ral  <cit> . moreover, pob <dig> was reported to bind directly epsin and eps <dig> with its eh domain  <cit> . this, in turn, can lead to actin assembly and to the formation of membrane ruffles and actin-rich filopodia  <cit> .

several studies have pointed out that peptides containing npf  motifs are consistently found in eh-domain ligands  <cit> . structural analyses of the domain ligand complex have demonstrated that the asparagine in the npf motif is in close contact with a highly conserved tryptophan residue in a hydrophobic pocket in the eh domain surface  <cit> . mutation of this conserved tryptophan residue dramatically impairs binding. a recent report has implicated a positively charged residue on the opposite side of the npf binding pocket of some eh domains in phosphatidylinositols binding, thus adding a new function to eh domains  <cit> .

although eh domains have never been proven to bind to dpf target peptides, the observation that the association between the eh domain of pob <dig> and eps <dig> is mediated by a c-terminal region containing several dpf <cit>  has lead to the proposal that some eh may be able to bind dpf. in addition it has been suggested that the association between the eh domains of eps <dig> and its own dpf rich c-terminus may favour eps <dig> multimerization  <cit> .

in the present study we confirm that the pob <dig> eh domain can bind specific dpf motifs in the c-terminal region of eps <dig>  this interaction was firstly demonstrated by panning a phage displayed peptide library. with the spot synthesis method we have been able to identify many dpf peptides in the c-terminal region of eps <dig> with the potential of binding the eh domain of pob, most of them included in the fragment encompassing amino acids 623– <dig> and containing five dpf motifs. clearly, a potentially eh binding peptide identified in eps <dig> with the spot experiment could be buried inside the folded protein and therefore it could be inaccessible to the interaction partner. on the other hand, the previous findings are consistent with the pull-down results as the same sequences also associate to pob1_eh domain. therefore, the overlap between the results obtained by different approaches confirms that the pob1_eh domain can bind dpf peptides and, more in general, point out the effectiveness of combining the classical pull-down method with the spot technology to study protein interactions.

furthermore, we suggest that a similar association between the first eh domain of eps <dig> and its c-terminus could participate in the stabilization of eps <dig> tetramers.

the dpf region of eps <dig> is also the binding site for the ap- <dig> complex, the adaptor which connects the clathrin lattice to the plasma membrane and interacts with tyrosine-based signals of several integral membrane proteins  <cit> . the binding site of ap- <dig> spans amino acids 668– <dig> in mouse eps <dig>  which corresponds to residues 667– <dig> of the human eps <dig>  <cit> . the eh domain of pob <dig> binds eps <dig> in the region encompassing amino acids 623– <dig>  thus the pob <dig> and ap <dig> binding sites on eps <dig> are close but distinct; moreover, neither of these sites coincide with the crk binding site   <cit> , suggesting that the binding of these proteins to eps <dig> may not be mutually exclusive. on the other hand the eh of pob <dig> and the first eh domain of eps <dig> both bind to the c-terminal dpf region and compete for the same ligand. it is tempting to speculate that the multimerization of eps <dig>  stabilized by the interaction between the n-terminal eh and the c-terminal dpf region, may modulate the interaction between pob <dig> and eps <dig> 

structural and mutational analysis of several eh domains clearly demonstrate that the conserved tryptophan at the base of the npf binding pocket is essential for domain functionality, while residues flanking the binding groove can influence specificity. for example, the eh <dig> domain of eps <dig> binds to a peptide mimicking the fw-internalization motif of mpr; moreover, nmr and mutational analysis unequivocally shows that fw and npf peptides bind in the same pocket and involve the same residues  <cit> . nonetheless, while mutation of residues in the binding site such as phe <dig> and arg <dig> substantially affect eh <dig> ligand binding, the corresponding mutants in the residues leu <dig> and lys <dig> in eh <dig> do not affect binding  <cit> .

the mutational analysis reported in our manuscript confirms that the conserved tryptophan in the binding pocket of pob1_eh domain is essential for peptide recognition, since the mutation w324a affects the interaction with both npf- and dpf peptides. in addition we provide evidence that the lysine residues k <dig> and k <dig>  which are distal to the binding pocket, are involved in this recognition. on the contrary, mutating phe <dig> to ala doesn't affect binding.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we have shown that the eh domains of pob <dig> binds the c-terminus of eps <dig> thanks to its affinity for dpf containing peptides. in addition we have identified a cluster of solvent exposed lys residues, which are only found in the eh domain of pob <dig>  and influence binding to both npf and dpf motifs. none of the mutants that we have characterized so far show a preferential binding for either npf or dpf motifs suggesting that the two motifs have a similar binding mode and that both npf and dpf binding require the hydrophobic pocket characterized in structural studies and the positively charged surface patch characterized in this study. the involvement of the positive patch, either by direct dpf binding or indirectly by modification of the tryptophan binding pocket, cannot be reconciled with the information provided by the structure of the peptide eh complexes described so far and the rationalization of these findings must await the characterization of structures of the dpf ligands described in this study and the pob <dig> eh domain.
