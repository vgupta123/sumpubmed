BACKGROUND
angiotensinogen  is a 452-amino acid plasma glycoprotein. this protein is specifically cleaved by the aspartic protease renin  to release the n-terminal decapeptide angiotensin i . ai is further hydrolyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme  to produce the octapeptide angiotensin ii, which regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance  <cit> . ang-deficient mice  <cit>  and renin-deficient mice  <cit>  exhibit profound hypotension, and no detectable ai was found in the plasma of mice with either knockout mutation  <cit> . these in vivo studies demonstrate the biological importance of enzymatic cleavage of ang by renin.

human renin has a much higher affinity for and shows a much greater velocity with ovine ang  than human ang . native oang, purified from sheep plasma, has been shown to be a better substrate for human renin, and it has been used in clinical renin assays  <cit> . the purification process for native oang has been established  <cit> : one study reported obtaining approximately 35 mg of native oang from 1 l of plasma from a nephrectomized sheep  <cit> . as an alternative to native oang, we prepared recombinant oang using a chinese hamster ovary  cell line that permanently expresses this protein  <cit> , with a yield of approximately 8 mg purified oang per liter of culture medium. although sheep and a cho cell line are effective sources for preparing milligram quantities of oang, an animal and cell culture equipment, respectively, are required to produce oang. moreover, about one month of cell culture is required to obtain such amounts of recombinant oang. biotechnological advances that make it possible to prepare a large amount of oang should facilitate clinical studies on renin.

to increase the availability of oang, we aimed to produce recombinant oang using an escherichia coli expression system, which makes it possible to express the protein in a few days. here, we report an e. coli-based system for the production of milligram levels of recombinant oang and show that recombinant oang expressed in e. coli functions as a human renin substrate.

RESULTS
expression screening of recombinant oang in e. coli
as a first step towards expressing recombinant oang in e. coli, we compared the effects of different host strains, induction levels, expression temperatures, and promoters on the solubility of oang. recombinant oang was first expressed from an isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside -inducible t <dig> promoter at 37 °c in de <dig> lysogens of six tested e. coli strains. under these conditions, oang was found in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate . we also found that e. coli b strains produced more oang than e. coli k strains . when we reduced the expression temperature to 25 °c, no significant band corresponding to oang was detected on a cbb stained sds-polyacrylamide gel . western blotting showed that when expressed at 25 °c, a small portion of the total oang was located in the soluble fraction of the bl <dig>  rosetta  <dig>  tuner, and shuffle t <dig> express competent  e. coli cell lysates . these results suggest that reducing the expression temperature facilitated proper folding, which yielded a higher amount of soluble oang.fig.  <dig> expression screening of recombinant oang in e. coli. comparison of oang expression and solubility using different e. coli  host strains and iptg concentrations at 37 °c  and 25 °c . recombinant oang was expressed from pet-11a-oang in e. coli  lysogens following induction with iptg , separated by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and then stained with coomassie brilliant blue . lane m, molecular marker; lane t, total cell lysate; lane s, soluble fraction; lane i, insoluble fraction. western blot analysis of oang expressed at 37 °c  and 25 °c  induced with iptg . soluble  and insoluble  fractions of the cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting with an anti-oang polyclonal antibody. molecular markers  were visualized by cbb staining. the molecular weights of the marker proteins are shown on the left. the arrowhead on the right shows the size of oang



the tac promoter is a hybrid of the lac and trp promoters, and its transcriptional activity is weaker than that of the t <dig> promoter  <cit> . to produce soluble oang at high yield, we expressed his-tagged oang from an iptg-inducible tac promoter at 37 °c in e. coli bl <dig> cells. to examine the amount of soluble oang, we purified it from the supernatant of the cell lysate using ni-affinity chromatography. the bound fraction contained a protein band with an estimated molecular weight that is similar to that of oang . this protein was identified as oang by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. next, we compared the effect of promoters on the solubility of recombinant oang. when expressed from a t <dig> promoter, oang accumulated in the insoluble fraction, and only a small proportion of oang was located in the soluble fraction . in contrast, the soluble to insoluble ratio was approximately 1: <dig> when oang was expressed from the tac promoter . these results indicate that expression from a weaker promoter  increased the ratio of soluble to insoluble recombinant oang.fig.  <dig> sds-page analysis of recombinant oang expressed from a tac promoter. a comparison of recombinant oang expressed from either a t <dig> promoter or a tac promoter. recombinant oang expression was induced with iptg  at 37 °c. e. coli cells transformed with either pet-11a-oang  or ptac-oang-his  were diluted to a similar od <dig> value and disrupted by sonication. recombinant oang in the soluble  and insoluble  fractions was visualized by western blotting. lane c, control preparation of oang produced by ptac-oang-his. b sds-page analysis of the purified recombinant oang preparations. the pooled fractions after each purification step were separated by sds-page and stained with cbb. lane m, molecular weight marker; lane  <dig>  cell lysate; lane  <dig>  supernatant of cell lysate; lane  <dig>  precipitant of cell lysate; lane  <dig>  pooled fractions after ni-nta superflow cartridge column chromatography; lane  <dig>  after hitrapq hp column chromatography; lane  <dig>  after hiload 16/ <dig> superdex 200 pg column chromatography. molecular weights of the marker proteins are shown on the left. arrowhead on the right shows the size of oang



purification of recombinant oang expressed in e. coli
to prepare a larger amount of oang, we harvested cell pellets  from a 15-l batch culture of e. coli bl <dig> cells harboring ptac-oang-his. after three successive chromatography steps, including a ni-affinity column, an ion-exchange column, and a gel filtration column, approximately  <dig>  mg of purified his-tagged oang was obtained per liter of culture. when reacted with human renin, this preparation produced ai, indicating that the purified oang is a functional renin substrate.

to increase the yield of soluble, active oang, we utilized both auto-induction culture medium and a novel culture system to express his-tag-fused oang from a tac promoter at 30 °c in e. coli bl <dig> cells. the absorbance of the culture medium at 600 nm  was approximately  <dig>  indicating the high efficiency of this culture system. using the three chromatographic steps described above, oang was purified to homogeneity according to sds-page . its molecular weight was estimated to be 50 k, which is similar to its calculated molecular mass .

the specific amount in the final preparation was  <dig>  μg of ai/mg of total protein. assuming a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda for oang and that one mole of oang yields one mole of ai with a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, the theoretical specific amount of ang is  <dig>  μg of ai/mg. based on this value, the purity of the final preparation was 91 %. the production yield was approximately  <dig>  mg of purified oang per liter of culture, although  <dig>  l of culture  was routinely used for oang production. on the other hand, the production yield using cho cells was approximately  <dig>  mg of purified oang per liter of culture. in the following analyses, recombinant oang expressed in e. coli  was compared with that expressed in cho cells .

protein size analysis of recombinant oang
to examine the molecular size of recombinant oang, we used analytical size-exclusion gel filtration and dynamic light scattering . the results of size-exclusion gel filtration showed that both recombinant oangecoli and oangcho exhibited one major peak . the apparent molecular weight of recombinant oangecoli was 42 k. in contrast, recombinant oangcho eluted more quickly , and its apparent molecular weight was 56 k. the dls results  showed that recombinant oangecoli and oangcho displayed one size distribution, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  % polydispersity, respectively. the hydrodynamic radii of recombinant oangecoli and oangcho were estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm, respectively, corresponding to globular proteins with molecular masses of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, respectively. as the calculated molecular mass is  <dig>  kda , these results show that recombinant oang is a monomer in solution. this finding is consistent with our previous report on oangcho  <cit> .fig.  <dig> protein size analysis of recombinant oangecoli and oangcho. the sizes of oangecoli  and oangcho  were determined by analytical size-exclusion gel filtration  and dls . purified oang was loaded onto a superdex  <dig> 10/ <dig> gl column equilibrated with 2 mm hepes and  <dig>  m kcl . the elution volumes of the marker proteins are shown. the calibration curve is shown in the inset. dls data were measured at 25 °c in a ph  <dig>  buffer solution containing  <dig>  mg/ml oang, 20 mm sodium phosphate, and 20 mm  or 33 mm  kcl. the size distribution by percent volume is presented



protein structure and stability analysis of recombinant oang
circular dichroism  analysis was carried out to obtain secondary structural information for recombinant oang. the cd spectrum of recombinant oangecoli was similar to that of oangcho . recombinant oangecoli was estimated to be composed of 24 % alpha helix and 22 % beta strand. these values are similar to those calculated from the crystal structure of human angiotensinogen , which is composed of 28 % alpha helix and 23 % beta strand.fig.  <dig> protein structure and stability analysis of recombinant oangecoli and oangcho. purified oangecoli  and oangcho  were analyzed by cd  and dsf . cd data were measured at 25 °c in a ph  <dig>  buffer solution containing  <dig>  mg/ml oang, 20 mm sodium phosphate, and 20 mm  or 33 mm  kcl. dsf data were measured with 10 μm oang in 5× sypro orange, 200 mm hepes, and  <dig>  m kcl . five typical plots for each preparation are shown. c comparison of the t

to examine the stability of recombinant oang, we used differential scanning fluorimetry . this method monitors the thermal unfolding of proteins in the presence of a hydrophobic fluorescent dye, and then the fluorescence intensity is plotted as a function of temperature  <cit> . the resulting intensity plot is used to estimate the melting temperature . the dsf results  showed that both recombinant oang products  undergo a two-state transition during the course of thermal denaturation. the tm of recombinant oangecoli and oangcho was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  °c and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  °c, respectively .

human renin reactivity
to determine whether the catalytic efficiency of recombinant oangecoli is comparable to oangcho, we carried out a steady-state kinetic analysis using both oang preparations. both exhibited a typical substrate saturation curve . the michaelis constant  values of the two preparations were similar, whereas the catalytic turnover  of oangecoli was slightly higher than that of oangcho . the order of magnitude of the catalytic efficiency  for the two preparations is in good agreement with that of a previous study by nakagawa et al.  <cit> .fig.  <dig> kinetic analysis of human renin with recombinant oangecoli and oangcho. renin activity in the presence of oangecoli  and oangcho  was analyzed by steady-state enzyme kinetics. various concentrations of oang were incubated with human renin  at 37 °c in sodium phosphate buffer  containing dfp and edta. the amount of ai produced was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . the error bars represent the standard deviation of the velocities

discussion
ang has significant sequence homology to representative members of the serine protease inhibitor  superfamily  <cit> . various recombinant serpins have been produced in e. coli  <cit> . when expressed in e. coli, some serpins are soluble, while others become insoluble and require refolding  <cit> . kunapuli et al.  <cit>  purified human ang expressed from an iptg-inducible lac promoter in e. coli. this preparation was cleaved by human kidney renin, as assessed by sds-page and western blotting; however, its enzymatic characterization was not reported  <cit> . zou et al.  <cit>  expressed recombinant human, mouse, and rat angs in e. coli using a sumo-fusion system. according to the data deposited in the protein data bank , a psumo <dig> plasmid with a t <dig> promoter was used to express human ang. the authors characterized the enzymatic properties of human ang and successfully determined the crystal structures of human, mouse, and rat ang as well as a renin-ang complex  <cit> . this report shows that the combination of e. coli and the sumo-fusion system is a good choice for expressing recombinant ang; however, the details of the expression and purification conditions are not available  <cit> . in the present study, a procedure was developed to prepare milligram quantities of recombinant oang expressed in e. coli.

when recombinant oang was expressed from a t <dig> promoter at 37 °c in various e. coli strains, it accumulated in the insoluble fraction . the breakthroughs in this study were  the use of a tac promoter and  the combination of a novel culture system and auto-induction culture medium. the former and the latter were shown to be useful in previous reports by ikeda-boku et al.  <cit>  and li et al.  <cit> , respectively. when the protein was expressed from a tac promoter at 37 °c, the ratio of soluble to insoluble recombinant oang increased significantly , and  <dig>  mg of recombinant oang was prepared from a 15-l culture of e. coli. although a milligram amount of oang was obtained using this procedure, the production yield was relatively low . with an aim to develop a higher-yield method, we devised a novel culture system in which e. coli cells were grown in culture medium that was aerated and agitated in a glass bottle. in addition, we used auto-induction medium  <cit>  in which e. coli cells initiate recombinant protein expression from a lac-based promoter when they switch carbon sources from glucose to lactose. as a result, the production yield increased by a factor of  <dig>  from  <dig>  mg to  <dig>  mg of oang per liter of culture. these breakthroughs enabled us to prepare a milligram quantity of oang on a small culture scale.

we compared the biophysical and enzymatic properties of recombinant oangecoli and oangcho. the proteins in both oang preparations are a similar size  and have similar secondary structural elements , a two-state transition during thermal denaturation , a similar affinity for human renin , and a similar catalytic efficiency . these results strongly suggest that the three-dimensional structure of recombinant oangecoli is very similar to that of oangcho. although the transcription, translation, and post-translational modifications of proteins differ between e. coli and cho cells, recombinant oangecoli must be properly folded since, according to anfinsen’s dogma  <cit> , the amino acid sequence of a protein is sufficient to determine its three-dimensional fold. in summary, these results show that recombinant oang expressed in e. coli is functionally comparable to oang expressed in cho cells.

recombinant oangcho possesses a single n-linked oligosaccharide chain  <cit> . on the other hand, recombinant oangecoli does not have the oligosaccharide chain because standard e. coli cells do not attach oligosaccharide chains to n-linked glycosylation sites  <cit> . the absence of the n-linked oligosaccharide on oangecoli may be the cause of its lower tm value .

compared in terms of “production yield divided by expression days,” the e. coli-based and cho-based production systems produced  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg oang/liter of culture/day of culture, respectively. therefore, the e. coli-based production system developed in this study is  <dig> times more time efficient than the cho-based system.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed an e. coli expression system that enables the rapid and easy production of recombinant oang protein and successfully prepared  <dig>  mg of purified oang per liter of culture medium. recombinant oang expressed in e. coli functions as a human renin substrate. plasma renin concentration  is used as a clinical parameter related to hypertension  <cit> . this newly developed e. coli expression system makes human renin substrate more available, which will be useful for clinical studies on renin.
