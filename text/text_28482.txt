BACKGROUND
cultivated rye  is, after wheat and barley, a major temperate cereal species. its large nuclear genome of around  <dig> gb/1c  <cit>  exceeds that of the average angiosperm   <cit> . a distinctive feature of the karyotype is that each chromosome arm harbors one or more large blocks of subtelomeric heterochromatin  <cit> , which is not the case in either wheat or barley chromosomes  <cit> . within the genus secale, nuclear genome size varies by some 15 %  <cit> , consistent with the variation in the size of the terminal heterochromatic blocks  <cit> . it would appear, therefore, that the expansion of subtelomeric heterochromatin is fundamental to the determination of genome size in the genus secale.

the rye genome as a whole comprises >90 % repetitive dna  <cit> . eukaryotic tandemly arranged repetitive sequences are typically based on monomers longer than 100 nt  <cit> ; transposable elements  represent the other major class of multi-copy sequence. in rye, unlike in human and many plant species  <cit> , tandem repeats are concentrated in the subtelomeric region rather than around the centromere . notably, the size of heterochromatic blocks in different rye species correlates with the copy number of tandem dna families  <cit> . molecular organization of the three most abundant of them, psc <dig> , psc <dig>  and psc <dig>  was characterized previously . they are composed of monomers  <dig>   <dig>  and 571 bp long, correspondingly, and each family constitutes several percent of the rye nuclear genome  <cit> . fluorescence in situ hybridization  experiments have suggested that the psc <dig> and psc <dig> blocks coincide close to the telomere, while some psc <dig>  copies are located at interstitial sites. the psc <dig>  sequence is also represented in a number of other cereal genomes, but psc <dig> and psc <dig> are largely rye-specific  <cit> . another tandem repeat family , which is present in many triticeae species  <cit> , is present on two of the seven rye chromosomes, including the short arm of chromosome 1r   <cit> .

despite a wealth of information regarding the monomers’ size and sequence, their higher order structure remains obscure, as do the mechanisms underlying their amplification. direct sequencing is hampered by their repetitive nature  <cit> . hence their long-range organization, mutual arrangement within arrays, and molecular features of flanking regions between tandem arrays and neighboring non-tandem dna remain poorly explored . these obstacles can be overcome by approaches allowing one to combine long- and short-range sequence information. these include the construction of bac  libraries with individual bac clones containing long  stretches of dna, and chromosome isolation  <cit> , which enables analysis of dna organization in individual chromosomes. in a previous work, a bac library was constructed from the 1rs arm, which was purified by flow sorting from a wheat-rye ditelosomic 1rs addition line  <cit> . at least 84 % of 1rs arm was found by bac-end sequencing and roche  <dig> sequencing to consist of repetitive dna and more than 5 % of the 1rs dna was occupied by  <dig> genes  <cit> .

with the exception of 1rs arm, dna composition, molecular structure of rye genome received little attention, as compared to the genomes of the closest relatives, wheat and barley. it was not until recently that a virtual linear gene order model encompassing over  <dig>  out of  <dig>  detected rye genes has been established using a combination of high-throughput transcript mapping,  <dig> sequencing dna of flow-sorted rye chromosomes, and synteny information of sequenced model grass genomes  <cit> . nonetheless, large-scale molecular organization of subtelomeric heterochromatin in rye chromosomes remains completely unknown.

here we address a number of questions, such as whether major families of tandem repeats are present as a single or multiple arrays in chromosome arms, what is the organization of monomers belonging to each family in different arrays, whether arrays composed by different family members are immediately adjacent to each other or are separated by some dna sequences, what is the nature of non-tandemly repeated dna flanking the arrays, and whether it shows any peculiar sequence features. this information may shed light on the molecular organization of heterochromatic regions as well as on the expansion mechanisms of tandem repeat families in the genome of cultivated rye, s.cereale.

RESULTS
the psc <dig> and psc <dig> repeats are present in rye chromosomes as multiple arrays
multicopy tandem repeat families psc <dig> and psc <dig> appear as strong and homogeneous signals upon fish with mitotic metaphase chromosomes  <cit> . meiotic chromosomes are less condensed at early prophase stage, than metaphase chromosomes, thereby providing higher resolution. fish analysis of meiotic prophase chromosomes sampled from the wheat-rye monotelosomic addition line harboring 1rs  showed that both the psc <dig> , and psc <dig>  sequences are present in extensive, non-overlapping domains on the rye chromosome arm. when the 1rs bac library was hybridized with psc <dig> and psc <dig>  not one of the nearly  <dig>  clones analysed hybridized with both probes, confirming that the two array types are not intermingled.fig.  <dig> multiple arrays of tandemly repeated families are present on the short arm of the rye chromosome 1r . a fish image of early meiotic prophase chromosomes of cs/1rs, showing the location of psc <dig>  and psc <dig>  sequences. b southern hybridization profiles of cs/1rs probed with psc <dig>  the size of hybridization fragments is shown in kb



the fish signal intensity varied along the length of the rye arm , in line with the idea that each family of tandem arrays is present as multiple interspaced arrays. furthermore, this is confirmed by the results of pulsed field gel electrophoresis  when bstxi-digested high molecular weight cs/1rs dna was subjected pfge and hybridized with psc <dig>  six hybridizing fragments were revealed, ranging in length from 40 kb to 270 kb . the observed variation in hybridization intensity, taken to indicate that at least some of the arrays harbored non-psc <dig> sequence, complicated the quantification of copy number of arrays in 1rs. a restriction analysis, followed by sequencing of the two 1rs bac clones 12i <dig> and 122 f <dig>  suggested that both harbored uninterrupted psc <dig> arrays  flanked on either side by non-array sequence. the conclusion is that the 1rs arm harbors several tandem arrays of psc <dig> and psc <dig> monomers.

heterogeneity of tandem array organization
some families of tandemly repeated dna sequences, such as human α-satellite dna are known to form higher order repeat  units that may contain variable numbers of basic repeats  having highly similar sequences of monomers  <cit> . hors were demonstrated to form in the centers of alpha-satellite dna arrays, with monomeric dna locating towards their edges  <cit> . the psc <dig> and psc <dig> tandem arrays formed higher order multimers, as shown by the ladder-like patterns seen in the southern hybridization profiles. psti-digested bacs 126С <dig> and 114i <dig> included psc <dig> hybridizing fragments consistent with the presence of both monomers and dimers , whereas the profile of 119С <dig> suggested the presence of trimers аnd that of 119М <dig> trimers and tetramers. a hindiii digestion of clone 114i <dig> produced a profile consistent with the presence of tetramers and hexamers, while clone 119c <dig> harbored octamers . psc <dig> multimers  have previously been identified  <cit> . thus, tandem arrays are organized into specific multimeric units within one chromosome arm. the maximum size of these multimers appears to be ~3 kb for psc <dig>  and ~ <dig>  kb for psc <dig> .fig.  <dig> pfge separation of psti-restricted bac inserts harboring psc <dig> arrays. a ethidium bromide stained gel, b southern hybridization probed with psc <dig>  lane 1: bac clone 126c <dig>  lane 2: 119c <dig>  lane 3: 119 m <dig>  lane 4: 114i10



when analysing bac clones from the 1rs library we identified five partially overlapping clones with inserts of different size, each containing psc <dig>  taii and psc <dig>  arrays . identical non-tandem dna was sequenced in all five clones indicating that they originated from the same genomic region. differences in the hybridization patterns produced by these bacs allowed us to accurately position multimeric units within the tandem arrays. for example, unlike the psc <dig> monomers and dimers, the tetramers of psc <dig> are absent in bac 130h <dig> . in contrast, other bacs with longer segments of psc <dig> array contain tetramers. as inferred from the hybridization patterns obtained with both psc <dig>  and psc <dig> , psc <dig> monomers and dimers, and similarly psc <dig>  trimers and tetramers, tended to lie at the ends of the arrays, whereas the higher order multimers were positioned more centrally.

in order to establish the degree of identity between consecutive monomers within a single array, we sequenced eleven full-length psc <dig> monomers  from ВАС119С <dig>  by creating nested unidirectional deletions using exoiii  <cit> . monomers from this region fell into two groups; the first with 96 % identity to the first monomer in the contig , and the second with 89 % identity . the monomers from these groups alternated in the array, as pairs suggesting their origin via duplication.table  <dig> percent identity of psc <dig> monomers present in bac clone 119c15

fragment of the psc <dig> array from dna bac199c <dig> was sub-cloned in a plasmid vector pgem-5zf. then a series of deletion clones was obtained according to  <cit>  and their inserts were sequenced and assembled into a contig encompassing  <dig> full-length monomers of psc200



phylogenetic relationships between the psc <dig> and psc <dig> copies
two sets of reads were extracted from the  <dig> dataset  <cit> : one containing psc <dig>  and the other containing psc <dig>  monomer sequences . the unrooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic network constructed for the psc <dig> monomers present on each rye chromosome comprised two major clades , consistent with a history of at least two time-separated bursts of amplification. the larger clade exhibited a star-like topology while the other was branched. the psc <dig> sequences present on chromosomes 5r and 7r separated into two recognizably distinct sub-clades. these are the only rye chromosomes which have retained fragments from the ancestral triticeae chromosome a <dig>  <cit> . all of the psc <dig> monomers analysed displayed a bimodal distribution of pair-wise genetic distances . the first peak in this distribution accounted for intra-clade nucleotide diversity , whereas the second reflected inter-clade diversity . two groups of monomers present in clone 119С <dig>  and organized as alternate dimers, mapped to distinct branches of the second clade .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of  psc <dig> and  psc <dig> monomers present on each of the seven rye chromosomes. the chromosome-specific  <dig> libraries obtained by martis et al.  were used to reconstruct phylogenetic networks and assign psc <dig> and psc <dig> monomers to each of the seven rye chromosomes . the phylogenetic trees shown represent galled phylogenetic networks generated by dendroscope v <dig> . <dig> software based on the trees obtained by maximum likelihood method. black circles at branch ends refer to sequenced psc <dig> monomers present in the ВАС clone 119С <dig> . the scale bar corresponds to the weighted evolutionary distance  and indicates the weighted number of substitutions per alignment site. the two histograms depicting the distribution of pairwise distances are shown: the x-axis plots the sequence pairwise distance  while the y-axis plots the occurrence frequency



the psc <dig> sequences formed a single clade with a star-like topology , which arose from the overall high level of sequence identity  between the monomers. such a situation probably reflects a relatively constant amplification rate over time. differences in the topology of phylogenetic networks derived for the psc <dig> and psc <dig> monomers are consistent with their distinct evolutionary ages: the former originated some  <dig> my before the latter, allowing ample time for sufficient sequence divergence to have occurred to generate branching in the psc <dig> second clade.

the nature of the sequences flanking the arrays of tandemly arranged monomers in bac clones
to uncover the nature of dna surrounding tandem arrays of monomers, we sequenced non-tandem  dna from six psc250- and five psc200-containing bac clones as well as from three segments of clone 84c <dig>  . a screen against the repeatmasker and trep databases identified known repetitive elements. the non-array sequences comprised mostly fragments in the size range several tens to several thousands of bp, and shared homology with various families of gypsy-like and copia-like ltr retrotransposons. short fragments of two line elements were also found. no full length tes were observed. illustrative examples of the nature of the non-array sequence are given in fig.  <dig>  in clone 122 f <dig>  the psc <dig> tandem array was bordered on the left by sequences which were, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % homologous to the central part of the miuse line and separated by a 375 nt stretch of anonymous sequence. on the right side, the array was bordered by two Сopia-like sequences, one  <dig>  % homologous to the bare- <dig> element and the other  <dig>  % homologous to the wis- <dig> element . given that bare- <dig> is a chimera between bare- <dig> and wis- <dig>  <cit> , the likelihood is that sequences adjacent to the arrays must have undergone multiple rounds of recombination. the structure of the non-array sequence present in clone 84С <dig> is consistent with this conclusion . here, the non-array sequence on the right side corresponded to a copy of a copia-like member of angela family, although oriented in the antisense direction, while the left part comprised three copies of the gypsy-13_ta-i element interrupted by two short sequences , one of which was a simple repeat, and the other sharing homology with the laura retrotransposon. this region was followed by a  <dig>  nt sequence homologous  to that of the xalas retrotransposon  and two more regions homologous to gypsy-13_ta-i. most of the non-array sequence in the central part of the bac shared homology with the xalax retrotransposon  and was embedded in a tandem array of taii monomers. this heterogeneous mosaic organization was also characteristic of the psc <dig> and psc <dig> monomers. several examples reported in the literature have documented arrays of tandem repeats comprising segments of various tes, predominantly ltrs  <cit>  but such a scenario of the psc <dig> and psc <dig> origin from known tes appears unlikely.fig.  <dig> the structure of bac clones  122 f <dig> and  84c <dig>  white rectangles: non-array sequence, black rectangles: vector dna



characterization of the rye genome composition
the availability of  <dig> reads derived from each rye chromosome  <cit>  has provided an opportunity to characterize the sequence composition of the rye genome more globally, and to extend the analysis of sequences flanking the tandem arrays in single bac clones to a genome-wide level. after trimming the adapters and applying quality filtering, the retained set of  <dig>  million  <dig> reads covered about  <dig> gbp . after a filtration step based on repeatmasker and trep, two subsets were generated – one containing psc <dig> and flanking dna  and the other  psc <dig> and flanking dna. these were considered to represent the junction regions  between non-array sequence and the tandem arrays.

table  <dig> shows the frequency of individual classes of te sequence present in the non-array sequence, of which almost 71 % was unambiguously identified. among the class ii tes , there was a notable enrichment of the cacta superfamily , a feature which has also been noted in other triticeae genomes  <cit> . other transposon families were poorly represented . an analysis of the reads showed that most of the repetitive dna in the rye genome was represented by class i tes, particularly gypsy ltr retrotransposons. the observed frequency of gypsy sequence was  <dig>  fold that of copia, consistent with the estimated  <dig>  fold ratio associated with the 1rs arm  <cit> . good agreement between genome-wide and 1rs arm frequencies was also observed for all repeated dna elements, major transposon superfamily cacta and tandem repeats  <cit> . significant differences in the abundance of the major retrotransposon families were noted in the genome as a whole compared to that found in the vicinity of the tandem arrays. gypsy-like tes were less frequently associated with tandem arrays , but were more common in the flanking sequence of the psc <dig> arrays than that of the psc <dig> ones. the occurrence of copia-like tes increased in the vicinity of the psc <dig> arrays. most importantly, there was substantial enrichment of solo ltrs around the psc <dig> arrays  and psc <dig> arrays  which exceeds the frequency of all the copia-like elements.table  <dig> sequence composition of genome-wide  <dig> reads and of the sequences adjacent to psc <dig> and psc <dig> arrays

we computed dna composition of all reads and compared with that in non-tandem dna adjacent to the psc <dig> and psc <dig> tandem arrays. length of all repeats was defined according to annotations that we got in output files of repeatmasker tool . columns “proportion” denote the ration of the cumulative length of the given non-tandem dna to the cumulative length of all reads



the vicinity of tandem arrays is populated by certain te families
according to trep, the vast majority of the solo-ltrs belong to the xalax or xalas groups of te with minor contribution of ginger element . further analysis was conducted in order to identify the proportions of different te families present in the genome as a whole, in the junctions between psc <dig> or psc <dig> arrays and in the neighboring non-array sequence. the total length of a given te’s sequence across all reads was calculated, and then normalized by overall reads’ length. in all, some  <dig> te families were identified, of which  <dig> most abundant families represented  <dig>  % of the identified tes. the abundance in the genome of the gypsy family sabrina was particularly high , with the next most abundant families ranging in occurrence from  <dig> to 5 % .fig.  <dig> the genome-wide and array-flanking sequence  abundance of various te families. only those te families exhibiting a large disparity in abundance are shown.



gypsy-13_ta-i, xalax/xalas and olivia are all relatively rare in the rye genome , but their abundance was noticeably higher in the flanking dna of the psc <dig> and psc <dig> arrays, particularly in the case of xalax/xalas. the xalax/xalas supergroup cannot be classified as a single family given the level of sequence diversity present, if one follows the rules of the unified classification  <cit> , rather it should be considered as two groups. xalas elements are very homogeneous, while homology between xalax and xalas is restricted to relatively short sequence blocks . thus, here, xalax and xalas were treated as independent tes; enrichment around the psc <dig> arrays was predominantly composed of xalas sequence .

several other families of tes show behavior similar to that of xalax/xalas around the psc <dig> and psc <dig> arrays . while gypsy-13_ta-i was more highly enriched around the psc <dig> than around the psc <dig> arrays, the opposite was the case for olivia. there was a pronounced difference between the genome-wide and tandem-array associated frequency of some other tes. for instance, daniela was enriched  <dig>  fold in the vicinity of the psc <dig> arrays, and laura occurred  <dig>  fold more frequently in regions adjacent to psc <dig> . at the same time, sequences around tandem arrays are depleted with respect to sabrina, the most abundant te in the genome as a whole. the differences between genome-average and local enrichment values for some other te families, such as cacta and sabine, are small. several tes were virtually absent from the tandem array flanking sequence, namely cereba, derami, sumana around psc <dig> and fatima around psc <dig>  thus, our analysis clearly shows that the local sequence composition around tandem arrays differs dramatically from the genome average, and displays several peculiar features.

structural features of the te/tandem repeat junctions
a de novo search for dna motifs in te/tandem repeat junctions was conducted to determine whether there was any uniqueness with respect to the nucleotide composition present in these regions. twelve top-scoring motifs  from the output of de novo search tool homer  were selected as the most enriched in the neighborhood of each family . none of these motifs featured in the vicinity of both tandem array families. a search for motif enrichment within junction sequences containing the commonest junction-associated tes was made by applying two criteria: first that the te was present in at least 5 % of all junctions and second that the te-containing junction displayed an at least two fold enrichment for the motif. only eight tes satisfied both criteria : four in the vicinity of psc <dig>  and four in the vicinity of psc <dig> . as is the case for xalas and xalax, daniela and olivia share extensive regions of homology within their ltrs . among various associations between the twelve motifs and the top psc200/ <dig> array-enriched tes, the strongest involved daniela and olivia around psc <dig>  and laura and xalas around psc <dig> . most of the motifs were represented in at least one of the te families. in the vicinity of the psc <dig> arrays, five motifs were identified in olivia  and daniela . in the non-array sequences around psc <dig>  six motifs were present in laura and eight in xalas: five of these were in common. some closely related sequences were also detected within the psc <dig> and psc <dig> arrays. for example, psc <dig> harbored cacaggatca  and caacgcctatg  , while psc <dig> harbored gtaacctggcc  .table  <dig> enrichment estimates  for top-scoring motifs

next, we explored whether there is any regularity in the localization of tes in these regions, i.e. whether tes tend to break at ltrs, or at their central domains, and whether unrelated spacer sequences may be present at the junctions. additional file  <dig> illustrates this distribution for the four chosen te families. the spacer sequences between the tes and the arrays were either absent, or at best short . about 90 % of the junctions between psc <dig> and laura/xalas elements fell into this category, as did most of the junctions between psc <dig> and daniela  and olivia .

at the junction points, most te copies began with the ltr’s 5′- or 3′-terminal nucleotide, or a nucleotide very close to the terminus . analysis based on repeatmasker software showed that half of the laura elements present in the vicinity of psc <dig> began with their first or last 1– <dig> nucleotides. similarly, 54 % of daniela copies and 68 % of olivia copies in the vicinity of psc <dig> began within the first  <dig> nucleotides of their ltr; as for psc <dig>  69 % of adjacent xalas copies began with nucleotides 1– <dig> of one or other ltr. mapping the top-scoring motifs against the sequences of daniela, olivia, laura, and xalas extracted from trep database revealed the same trend, namely the motif density was the highest within the first 300 bp of their 5′- or 3′- ltrs  particularly with respect to motifs  <dig> and  <dig> in the daniela and olivia ltrs.

thus, our analysis of genomic dna composition and de novo identification of dna motifs overrepresented in the vicinity of psc <dig> and psc <dig> sequences uncovered enrichment of these regions with 5′- and 3′-ltrs of olivia/daniela and laura/xalas tes, respectively. these results point to the substantial role of nucleotide context in the formation of dna flanking tandem repeats, which is likely based on its involvement in the molecular mechanisms taking place during amplification of tandem arrays and associated recombination events.

discussion
multiple arrays of tandem repeats with distinct higher-order organization are present in the chromosomes of rye
the organization of tandemly repeated sequences is poorly understood, not just in the cereals, but in eukaryotes generally. a notable exception is the human α-satellite, comprising a large array at each centromere which emerged as a paradigm for understanding the genomic organization of other tandem dna sequences . although these latter arrays are mostly homogeneous, a few chromosomes harbour two or more distinct arrays each defined by different hors  <cit> . here, the application of fish clarified that the psc <dig> and psc <dig> arrays located close to the 1rs telomere are organized into discrete domains, a conclusion supported by the southern hybridization analysis. we believe that this observation can be extrapolated to heterochromatin regions of other rye chromosomes. the evidence for this extrapolation is supported by the size of the set of junction site sequences , which number far more than the number of chromosome arms. it is possible that some of these reads arose from non-array sequence embedded in the monomer array, but these cannot be common since none emerged from the sequencing of several 1rs bac clones. the frequency of direct junctions between psc <dig> and psc <dig> arrays is very low; only six reads fell into this category, which further reinforces our conclusion that each of these two families has its own, distinct localization domain on the rye chromosomes. nonetheless, the fact that psc <dig> and psc <dig> fish signals display partial overlap is indicative of the close proximity and short junction regions between both domains.

hors are composed of monomers with nearly identical nucleotide sequence and are found located in the centers of alpha-satellite dna arrays  <cit> . in this work we show that in rye, psc <dig> and psc <dig> sequences form multimeric units with the number of monomers varying from  <dig> to  <dig> and that the multimeric units map to the centres of the arrays. multiplicity of monomers within these multimeric units is specific for each individual array found in 1rs. this may argue in favor of multiple recombination events involving distinct tandem arrays within one chromosome arm, which led to hor formation. supportive evidence of active recombination within tandem arrays is provided by the level of sequence divergence  observed between psc <dig> monomers arranged as dimers within a bac119c <dig>  which implied that two monomers first formed a single unit, which was later amplified as a unit. it has been suggested that, during the evolution of tandem arrays, early duplication events were more frequent than subsequent amplification steps  <cit> . the dimeric repeat structure is universal for alpha satellite dna, as it is present across various old world monkey species  <cit>  and is 15– <dig> my old based on the estimated evolutionary divergence of these species  <cit> .

a comparison of rye tandem repeat families and primate α-satellite dna
most of the psc <dig> and psc <dig> arrays ranged in length from 40–300 kb  <cit> , while the human α-satellite forms much longer arrays of up to  <dig> mbp  <cit> . the two array types are also located in a different part of the chromosome . the postulated mechanisms for the generation and maintenance of tandem arrays include unequal sister-chromatid exchange, sequence conversion, translocation exchange and transposition  <cit> . as most α-satellite subsets are chromosome-specific, the within homologs exchange frequency is thought likely to be significantly higher than that occurring between non-homologs  <cit> . the psc <dig> and psc <dig> tandem arrays appear to have distinct evolutionary histories. several psc <dig> copies are present in hexaploid wheat and other triticeae species  <cit> , but has also been identified in the more distantly related rice and oat. as a result, it must have arisen at least  <dig> mya, when the rice and oat lineages diverged  <cit> , making it more ancient than the human α-satellite, whose presence throughout the primate order dates it to some  <dig> mya  <cit> . the psc <dig> sequence is much younger; its appearance as isolated copies in a few triticeae species  <cit>  dates it to  <dig> mya. despite their representation across multiple grass species, the expansion of both families has postdated the divergence of secale from its closest relatives  <cit> . thus, both families have been amplified over a much shorter timescale than α-satellite dna.

the topology of both the psc <dig> and psc <dig> phylogenies was largely star-like, in contrast to the tree-like form of the human α-satellite phylogeny  <cit> . with the exception of the chromosome 5r and 7r sub-clades, the chromosomal origin of the psc <dig> monomers was heterogeneous. the presence of multiple, relatively short arrays on each rye chromosome, along with a predominantly star-like phylogeny, are consistent with the rapid evolution of these arrays, likely accelerated by illegitimate recombination including interchromosomal recombination events. this model is supported by fish-identified presence/absence and intensity polymorphisms for both psc <dig> and psc <dig> between homologs of different cereal rye accessions [ <dig>  as well as the readiness with which introgression occurs in s. cereale x s. montanum hybrids  <cit> . exchange of satellite sequences between chromosomes is not unprecedented and was demonstrated for allopolyploid nicotiana species  <cit> . the presence of the 5r- and 7r-specific psc <dig> sub-clades may be connected with the observation that it is only these chromosomes which still harbor fragments of the ancestral triticeae chromosome a <dig>  <cit> , but how such ancient dna segments may have escaped interchromosomal exchanges is not clear.

the abundance of certain te families in the vicinity of psc <dig> and psc <dig> arrays
tes are responsible for much of the genome enlargement seen in the cereals  <cit> , and their concentration in heterochromatin is well-established. thus it was expected that te sequence would be common in the regions flanking the psc <dig> and psc <dig> arrays. the sequences appeared as a mosaic of incomplete, heterogeneous tes, likely resulting from nested insertions subjected to subsequent recombination, duplication and indel formation  <cit> . the analyses of barley and wheat genomic sequence has shown that most te families are present in relatively low copy numbers and that just  <dig> families make up at least 50 % of the genome complement  <cit> . similarly in rye, the sabrina family constituted an estimated  <dig>  % of the nuclear genome. why particular te families have been able to expand in a species-specific manner is quite unknown. sabrina was first identified in barley  <cit>  but is widespread in the triticeae  <cit>  including wild species of secale  <cit> . although similar to gypsy, it contains an env-like gene, the product of which includes predicted transmembrane domain which may aid its horizontal transfer. notably, in s. cereale, sabrina is only seldom seen in subtelomeric regions  <cit> , suggesting that it has not been actively involved in the formation of the prominent heterochromatin blocks.

a striking feature of psc <dig> and psc <dig> array flanking sequence is that although it has been enriched for te sequence, the tes involved were not highly abundant across the genome as a whole. the frequency of solo-ltr elements is particularly notable around psc <dig>  ectopic exchanges were likely commonplace in the vicinity of the arrays as this is in line with the predictions of the ectopic exchange model  <cit> . the solo-ltrs present in the flanking sequence were largely a heterogeneous mixture of xalas and xalax. the former element was first identified in barley  <cit> , and despite its relatively large size , it has not been assigned to any of the ltr-retrotransposon superfamilies, as no coding domain-like sequences have yet been identified. various representatives of xalas/xalax share relatively short regions of incomplete homology . thus, these elements cannot be classified as a single family according to the 80-80- <dig> rule  <cit> ; a similar level of identity applied between the terminal segment of the daniela and olivia ltrs. the major processes likely responsible for the formation of solo-ltrs are unequal crossing over and intrachromosomal ectopic recombination between ltrs of the same or even different elements, when they share the regions of homology. if recombination involves the ltrs of different elements, a range of recombination products may result, potentially leading to chromosome rearrangement  <cit> .

multiple recombination mechanisms were likely involved in the expansion of rye tandem repeats and their flanking tes
whereas the molecular basis of recombination between tandem repeat has long been an active research topic, little attention has been given to resolving whether the sequences adjacent to the arrays affect the expansion process. the sequences flanking human α-satellite dna are highly heterogeneous  <cit>  and do not seem to be enriched for tes  <cit> . any recombination event involves the formation of double-strand breaks and their subsequent repair. the latter process is achieved by non-homologous end joining  and homologous recombination   <cit> . the present analysis of the array/te junctions indicated that most of the te sequence was integrated either directly into the monomers or attached to it via a very short  spacer, consistent with the nhej scenario. most of the junctions between psc <dig> and laura/xalas and between psc <dig> and either daniela or olivia followed this pattern.

a degenerate 13 nt motif has been demonstrated to be associated with ~40 % of human crossover hotspots  <cit> . currently, no such clear association between recombination and specific dna sequence motifs has been established in plants  <cit> . nonetheless, the junction regions in rye are clearly enriched with respect to several dna motifs, some of which may be involved in other known dna repair mechanisms acting independently of nhej and hr  <cit> . the heterogeneity of dna motifs found in the tes, combined with the relatively low level of sequence similarity within the homologous regions of xalas/xalax and daniela/olivia, fit the requirements for microhomology-mediated break-induced replication and gene conversion to function  <cit> . the length of the motifs identified  agrees well with a recognition mechanism allowing recombinases to align single-stranded dna with a homologous duplex . once a presynaptic complex has engaged a particular 8-nt  tract of microhomology, it may become exchanged with other region of dsdna bearing the same microhomology, yet resist exchanges with unrelated sequences  <cit> . the number of rearrangements induced by microhomology-driven pathways is likely to be higher than is currently thought  <cit> . the outcomes of these currently under-appreciated repair pathways could include an increased copy number of the sequences being repaired  <cit> . consequently, these mechanisms may be a significant contributor to the formation of heterochromatic blocks.

shaping the rye genome by tandem repeats
although the barley and wheat-rye lineages diverged approximately 10– <dig> mya  <cit> , and wheat and rye shared a common ancestor only 6– <dig> mya  <cit> , the karyotypes of these three species vary drastically with respect to both their size and structure  <cit> , although not with respect to their gene content  <cit> . it is widely accepted that differences in genome size between closely related species are largely attributable to the quantity of intergenic dna present, which in turn is heavily influenced by te copy number and composition. in the case of rye, an increased te content has not been the sole factor contributing to its genome expansion; in addition there has been a massive amplification of tandemly repeated dna, based on psc <dig> and psc <dig>  monomers. this conclusion is supported by the positive correlation between larger heterochromatic blocks and higher content of tandem dna repeat families in the cultivated rye  as compared to wild rye species  <cit> . the high copy tandem repeats found in barley and wheat, hvrt  <cit> , psc <dig>   <cit> , dpta <dig>  <cit>  and taii  <cit> , are significantly less abundant than are psc <dig> and psc <dig> in rye.

the presence of multiple copies of the repeated dna sequences in each subtelomeric region might be expected to promote pairing between homologous and non-homologous chromosomes. the termini of rye chromosomes are known to play a key role in the initiation of synapsis  <cit> , and since they remain associated for a longer period than other parts of the chromosome, it has been suggested that this explains why the frequency of recombination increases along the centromere-telomere axis  <cit> . the recombination rate gradient along the centromere-telomere axis is steeper in the wheat close relative aegilops speltoides  than in einkorn wheat   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
early studies have noted that tandemly repeated dna can increase in copy number over a relatively short evolutionary time by replication conversion-like events or via some other unexplained mechanisms  <cit> . this phenomenon has recently received further support via analysis of the evolutionary fate of various satellite repeats in species from nicotiana section polydicliae  <cit> . significant progress has been made over the past twenty years in understanding the molecular nature of various recombination pathways. direct involvement of psc <dig> dna in the association of subtelomeric regions of two or more bivalents was demonstrated by fish  <cit> . it is highly probable that the heterogeneous composition of psc <dig> and psc <dig> multimeric units and the localization of multimers to the central part of monomer arrays is a by-product of unequal crossing over and homologous recombination. gene conversion and ectopic exchanges between homologous and non-homologous chromosomes have promoted the formation of multiple arrays of each repeat family and contributed to a significant enrichment of the flanking sequences with solo ltrs and several te families. the presence of short microhomology tracts in these elements implies a contribution of other known recombination pathways  <cit> . thus, all the above-listed mechanisms may have been involved in creating the bewildering complexity of recombination events that have ultimately resulted in expansion of tandem repeat families psc <dig> and psc <dig> as well as several tes in the rye genome.
