BACKGROUND
transcription by eukaryotic rna polymerase ii complex , composed of ten or more subunits  <cit> , involves multiple steps including initiation, promoter clearance, elongation, and termination. each step requires different activities. the initiation process involves rnapii recognition of core promoter elements at the transcription start site   <cit> . bound rnapii opens a bubble in the duplex dna and begins transcribing short rnas by a scrunching mechanism  <cit> . while the first steps of initiation and promoter clearance are slow and highly regulated, elongation is rapid  <cit> . this makes elongation an ideal mechanism for rapidly responding to changing conditions. a stalled or paused rnapii has completed the slow steps such that de-pausing allows for rapid completion of transcription.

great progress has been made on the biochemistry of elongation, although the exact composition of complexes is unclear due to biological context, biochemical complexity, and/or methodologies used in various studies. for the majority of genes, after transcription of about  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, rnapii pauses when  <dig> -dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole  sensitivity inducing factor ) and negative elongation factor  protein complexes bind to the rnapii and transcript , to form a dsif-nelf complex promoting the pausing of rnapii . paused rnapii is released by the positive transcription elongation factor b complex , which phosphorylates the dsif and nelf complexes as well as the carboxy-terminal domain of rnapii  . the catalytic and regulatory components of p-tefb are cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  and cyclin t respectively . in addition to p-tefb, cdk <dig> can also form a complex with cyclin k  <cit> . recruitment of p-tefb kinase dissociates nelf, transforming dsif into a positive elongation factor, triggering elongation  <cit> .

p-tefb is often part of larger complexes . for example, the super elongation complex , is a key regulator required for transcriptional elongation checkpoint control and rapid transcriptional induction . in addition to p-tefb, sec contains 11- <dig> lysine-rich leukemia , encoded by suppressor of triplolethal ), and all1-fused gene from chromosome 4/fragile mental retardation  <dig>  family member  <dig> , encoded by lilliputian   <cit> . another transcriptional elongation complex is the dot <dig> complex   <cit> , which contains the histone h <dig> lys  <dig>  methyltransferase dot1l, encoded by grappa   <cit> . h3k <dig> methylation by dot <dig> may regulate transcription of genes by changing chromatin structure and accessibility of transcription factors  <cit> , and has been implicated in many basic functions such as cell cycle regulation, chromosomal stability, and the dna damage response  <cit> . there is also evidence that lilli and su are essential for the h3k <dig> methylation function of dotcom during transcriptional activation, and evidence of large complexes including components of dot <dig>  p-tefb, and sec, such as the elongation assisting protein complexes  and complexes of mixed lineage leukemia  <dig> proteins   <cit> . additional complexity includes the little elongation complex , which contains su but lacks lilli and cdk <dig>  <cit> , and af <dig> family/enl family/p-tefb complex , which contains lilli and cdk <dig> but lacks su  <cit> . these studies indicate that there are many possible elongation complexes  <cit> . we have explored the roles of these complexes by examining the rna expression profiles when some of these key components are altered in drosophila. specifically, knockdown of lilli or su should disrupt sec, eap, and mll. lec should be altered by knockdown of su but not lilli, and aep should be altered by knockdown of lilli but not su. the dominant-negative form of cdk <dig> should disrupt p-tefb, sec, and aep, but not mll.table  <dig> components of different elongation related complexes or protein group

the regulatory advantage of rnapii pausing and elongation control is that rapid responses can be achieved if earlier rate-limiting steps occur, leaving only the more rapid elongation step for completion of transcription . such a rapid transcriptional response is critical when organisms experience rapid environmental changes. for example, rnapii pausing has been extensively studied in the context of the rapid transcription of drosophila heat shock genes . the rapid response is essential because failure to adjust to rapid temperature change results in catastrophic denaturation or mis-folding of proteins  <cit> . increased levels of protein chaperones encoded by the heat shock loci ameliorate this stress. the presence of dsif and nelf results in rnapii pausing near the heat shock gene promoters  <cit> , but following a heat shock, p-tefb quickly redistributes to the heat shock genes, which allows rnapii to elongate resulting in rapid production of transcripts  <cit> . other types of stress requiring a quick response in drosophila, such as arbovirus infection, are also regulated at the level of elongation  <cit> . regulation of transcription elongation also plays a role during development. an example is the pausing of rnapii downstream of the  sloppy-paired- <dig> promoter by nelf during the rapid blastoderm-stage of development  <cit> . it is likely that there are other genes responding rapidly due to normal physiology. our expression profiles might help identify them.

elongation control also plays a role in sexual development in drosophila. sex is determined by counting x chromosomes  <cit> . in wild-type flies, xx individuals are female and xy individuals are male. the genic imbalance created by x chromosome monosomy in males is compensated by increasing x chromosome gene expression  <cit> . at the regulatory level, the xx karyotype results in the activation of sex-lethal , which controls a major branch in the sex determination network  <cit> . sxl regulates the splicing of transformer  pre-mrna, which ultimately is responsible for nearly all sexually dimorphic aspects of development, physiology, and behavior . one of the most important genes downstream of tra is doublesex , which encodes sex-specific isoforms of a doublesex-mab3-related-transcription factor . dmrts are used to regulate sexual dimorphism in most metazoans  <cit> . the lilli and su loci are likely to be direct targets of dsx, and while the cdk <dig> locus was not among the most obvious dsx target genes, it has a strong and conserved dsx binding site  <cit> . knocking down lilli or su in dsx expressing cells results in dramatic sex- and context-specific phenotypes. for example, in males, the formation of specific first leg bristles known as sex combs, shows female pigmentation and narrower female-like morphology, but male distal/proximal orientation. in females, the first legs are normal, but bristles on the genitalia are missing. in males, the genitalia are normal. thus, these genes function in female-specific development in one tissue and male-specific development in another  <cit> . if regulators of elongation play a post-developmental role in other aspects of sexual dimorphism, such as physiology, then we would expect to see sex-specific effects of disrupting the function of those complexes in adult flies.

RESULTS
knockdown and overexpression efficiency
we were interested in measuring the effect of lilli, su, and cdk <dig> on gene expression in adults to probe for roles of elongation. because these genes are required for organismal viability during development  <cit> , we bypassed the developmental defects by using ubiquitously expressed gal <dig>  <cit>  along with ubiquitously expressed temperature sensitive gal <dig> repressor   <cit>  and gal <dig> responsive constructs expressing rnai against lilli, and su  <cit>  . we also used a dominant negative cdk <dig> construct  made by substituting an asparagine for an aspartic acid codon at position  <dig>  in the active site of the kinase. the same substitution has been used in other studies, where it has been shown to block p-tefb ctd kinase activity  <cit> . cdk9
dn under uas control was introduced into flies using p-element mediated transformation. expressing cdk9
dn during development resulted in lethality . flies bearing the cdk9
dn transgene were viable to adulthood at 20 °c in the presence of both gal <dig> and gal80
ts.fig.  <dig> experimental design and efficiency of rnai or cdk9

 <dig>  males. the schemata  shows how the shams were used as references for all induction timepoints for both females and males in results presented in subsequent figures. see methods for further information. transgenes are shown as bars, with regulatory sequences  from tubulin  or the gal <dig> upstream activation sequence , and encoding sequences  from the gal80

we were concerned that interfering with these important transcriptional regulators would result in cell lethality and an uninformative signature of dying cells even if we bypassed developmental defects. to assess the effect of these genes on adult viability, we shifted  <dig> to 4 day old adult flies from the permissive temperature of 20 °c to the restrictive temperature of 29 °c to induce transgene expression. we observed no overt lethality after up to a week. the lack of adult lethality allowed us to measure the effect of cdk <dig>  lilli, and su on the adult steady-state transcriptome in the absence of developmental defects or reduced viability. we crossed gal <dig> and gal80
ts to the experimental lines and to two control lines, which acted as shams to monitor any differential expression due to gal <dig> and gal80
ts alone . we used these sham genotypes without uas transgenes as controls in addition to the temperature shifts. we collected sexed samples zero, one, and two days post temperature shift to 29 °c. flies were the same age post-eclosion  when harvested. because germline gene expression is not controlled in the expression system we used  <cit> , we removed the gonads from the flies before preparing polya+ rna for stranded rna-seq expression profiling. all experiments were biologically triplicated to quadruplicated using three flies per sample. we used a total of  <dig> samples, after confirming that mismatched replicate numbers did not impact conclusions . we obtained above background rna-seq reads for more than  <dig> genes in each sample. we used the deseq <dig>  <cit>  normalized read count statistical model to measure differential expression . for each experimental sample, we made ratiometric measurements comparing replicate experimental samples to replicate sham samples as a reference. see methods and geo  <cit>   for detailed protocols, data, and replication statistics. a summary of all gene expression data can be found in the additional file  <dig> 

we first assayed the effectiveness of the adult induction experiments . we detected expression of gal <dig> and gal80
ts in all samples. prior to the temperature shift, we observed no significant differential expression in lilli relative to shams , but we did observe modest but significant  reductions in target gene expression in the su
rnai flies . we also observed modest but significant overexpression of cdk9
dn , and we confirmed that the increased expression was from the transgenic cdk9
dn allele by measuring the fraction of the reads bearing the codon substitution . these data indicate that the su
rnai and cdk9
dn transgenes were not fully “off” at 20 °c. following the temperature shift to 29 °c, we observed dramatic reduction of su  and lilli  steady-state expression in the appropriate rnai bearing flies and dramatic overexpression of cdk9
dn  relative to shams. these data indicate that we altered the expression levels  of the three genes under study.

effects on gene expression
to explore the transcriptional responses to transgene induction, we compared replicated results from experimental samples relative to each of the two types of sham samples and asked for significantly differentially expressed genes in any of these time- and temperature-matched comparisons. we observed extensive and significant differences in the gene expression profiles relative to sham controls in these  <dig> pairwise comparisons, especially for reduced expression in the experimental samples . overall we observed that  <dig> genes showed significant differential expression in at least one pairwise comparison. this constituted 27% of all genes in the genome and 58% of the genes that we scored as expressed in all samples. to identify patterns that we could use to classify the responses of this large set of differentially expressed genes in a way that would allow us to infer which elongation complexes might be affected, we used k-means to cluster the expression ratios of experimental relative to sham samples. we removed clusters driven by background genotypes . we observed that  <dig> differentially expressed genes were clearly attributed to lilli
rnai, su
rnai, or cdk9
dn  treatments. there were four clusters of genes that were dominated by reduced gene expression on treatment: cluster  <dig> was down-regulated by lilli
rnai, su
rnai and cdk9
dn, clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were down-regulated following lilli
rnai or su
rnai , and cluster  <dig> was down-regulated only following cdk9
dn expression. there was strong concordance between the lilli
rnai and su
rnai profiles in all clusters. that there were no clear clusters of genes differentially expressed due to only one of these rnai treatments, suggests that wild-type lilli and su positively regulate  many of the same genes. this is consistent with the hypothesis that these proteins are often obligatory components of the same functional complex. cluster  <dig> showed reduced expression following cdk9
dn induction, suggesting that wild-type lilli, su, and cdk <dig> positively regulate these genes , consistent with the participation of all three activities at a subset of genes. this is the correlation expected for disrupted sec or eap. most gene expression altered by lilli and su  were not regulated by cdk <dig>  which is consistent with the composition of mll. the cdk9
dn expression profile was distinct . therefore, there is also cdk9-specific differential expression profile, consistent with a role for p-tefb alone.fig.  <dig> differential expression and clustering. a-b vocano-plots showing examples of differential expression for lilli

expression of genes encoding enzymes
to help determine if positive regulators of transcriptional elongation affect specific tissues or organs, we used flyatlas data from adults  <cit>  to determine if differentially expressed genes had enriched expression in particular tissues. we found that the overall expression profile was not strongly enriched for genes expressed in any adult tissues , consistent with our use of the entire fly other than the gonads. strikingly, the genes showing differential expression following lilli
rnai, su
rnai, or cdk9
dn induction showed coherence in implied tissue-specificity . we found that all clusters with differentially expressed genes had enriched expression in the midgut. this is intriguing, as the midgut environment is subject to rapid changes as food passes through the digestive tract.fig.  <dig> characteristics of differentially expressed genes. a heatmap showing enrichment for genes expressed in tissues  of wild-type flies from flyatlas among genes in the fig.  <dig> clusters or among all genes expressed in our study . the proportion of genes in a column enriched in each tissue  is shown in hierarchical order. tissues are written out except: ta ganglion = thoracicoabdominal ganglion; cns = central nervous system; acc gland = male accessory gland; v = virgin, and m = mated. the carcass is the thorax and abdomen without gut and reproductive tract. b heatmap showing go biological process terms  enriched in any cluster . go terms are also presented in hierarchical clustering order. c-d browser views showing expression of two sets of related genes that are genomic neighbors and are positively regulated by lilli and su . c the lysosomal α-mannosidase  genes. d the jonah  chymotrypsin genes. chromosome arm and genome coordinates are shown . the longest annotated transcript of each gene is shown. in the gene models, untranslated  and coding  regions, and introns  are shown. transcription direction is shown . base-level read density per million reads   is shown for rnai  and sham  as are test genes or sham abbreviations . instances of significant induction-dependent differential expression are indicated . e boxplot of primary transcript length  by cluster  or among all expressed genes . clusters with significantly shorter  primary transcript than all expressed genes are indicated 




to determine if there was a functional category of genes differentially expressed due to the transgenes, we performed gene ontology  term analysis  using expressed genes as the reference, and selected all terms that were enriched in one of the clusters. the enriched terms were associated with proteolysis, various aspects of amino acid or carbohydrate metabolism, transport, and pheromones. the genes regulated by all three of the transgenes  were enriched for genes encoding typsins with serine-type endopeptidase function . the genes down-regulated following lilli
rnai or su
rnai but not cdk9
dn induction  were also enriched in genes encoding proteolysis functions in addition to metabolic, sensory, and transport functions. we show two examples of gene groups encoding important digestive enzymes that were down-regulated by transgene induction: the lysosomal alpha-mannosidase  genes  and chymotrypsin encoding jonah genes . we found that these genes required lilli and su  for high level expression . they also both showed strongly midgut-biased expression in wild-type flies  <cit> , and their wild-type functions involve carbohydrate hydrolysis in mannose production  <cit>  and proteolysis   <cit>  respectively.

we noticed that many of these enzyme-encoding genes with differential expression had short primary transcripts. therefore, we determined if there was an overall tendency for preferential regulation of genes with short transcripts, by plotting the distributions of annotated primary transcript length of genes in each expression ratio cluster . interestingly, the genes regulated by all three tested genes  have significantly shorter primary transcripts than all expressed genes . moreover, the genes regulated by lilli and su  also have significantly shorter primary transcripts than all expressed genes . in contrast, the genes regulated by cdk <dig> had insignificantly shorter primary transcript length compared to all expressed genes . it is worth noting that the two clusters with the shortest primary transcripts  also had the strongest down regulation of expression after induction , as well as concordant enrichment of genes with proteolysis function . given that control by elongation and short transcript length both contribute to rapid production of mature transcripts, these data suggest that many genes involved in metabolism have been optimized for rapid elongation.

sex-biased regulation
we were intrigued by the role for positive elongation factors in the expression of a large number of metabolic enzyme encoding genes expressed in the midgut, as the drosophila midgut shows sex-biased physiology and morphology, due to factors such as the immense metabolic requirements to support egg development and the requirements for specific saturation states in lipids used for pheromone production . additionally, lilli and su are required for external sexual morphology  <cit> . this raised the possibility that there could be different roles for positive elongation factors in the sexes. to explore this hypothesis, we measured sex-biased responses to gene expression treatments relative to shams for all  <dig> differentially expressed genes. we then followed a k-means clustering procedure to identify genes with sex-biased patterns . we found three clusters  showing a coherent sex difference in expression . genes in cluster i showed higher expression in males relative to females following cdk9
dn treatment, suggesting a role for p-tefb. genes in cluster ii showed reduced expression in males relative to females, while those in cluster iii showed higher expression in males relative to females following lilli
rnai and su
rnai treatments, but not cdk9
dn. these results suggest a role for mll in regulating sex-biased expression.fig.  <dig> sex-biased regulation after knockdown of elongation. a heatmap of induction-dependent sex-biased effects. clusters are labeled . a cluster with eight genes is included in cluster ii due to its small size and similar pattern as cluster ii. see fig.  <dig> for labeling. b heatmap of enrichment for tissue specific expression in the clusters. see fig.  <dig> for labeling, except m = male and f = female in the key. c heatmap of go biological process terms enriched in any of the clusters. see fig.  <dig> for labeling. d-e browser views of two examples of sex-biased gene regulation  are shown - cg <dig>  and cg <dig> . note that these two cg names differ by placement of a single digit. see fig.  <dig> for labeling, except that we distinguish female  and male  expression




to determine where these genes with sex-biased responses might be expressed, we again compared to the flyatlas dataset . in addition to the digestive system, genes expressed in carcass were enriched in all three clusters. the flyatlas definition of carcass is the thorax and abdomen after removal of the other tissues and organs, so this category includes epidermis, musculature, and oenocytes, which perform liver-like functions in drosophila  <cit> . we also found modest enrichment of genes expressed in a variety of non-gonadal tissues in the other clusters. to help determine the function of the genes showing sex-biased differential expression, we performed go term enrichment analysis and observed that the most significant enrichment was trans-membrane transport and fatty acid elongation in genes regulated by cdk <dig> . genes showing sex-biased expression due to lilli
rnai and su
rnai treatment were enriched in secondary metabolic processes . despite the lack of significant enrichment for go terms in cluster ii, we did observe sex-biased differential expression for at least a few genes encoding metabolic functions. for example, cg <dig> encodes a protein with similarity to lipases and requires lilli and su activity for its male-biased expression . this possible lipase shows highly midgut-biased expression in wild-type flies  <cit> . as another example, cg <dig> encodes a protein with similarity to fatty acyl-coa reductases and low level of expression in females requires lilli and su . the putative reductase is highly expressed in wild-type fat body, heart, and carcass but not in other tissues  <cit> . thus, like the overall pattern of differential expression, the sex-biased response to elongation factors was enriched in genes encoding metabolic functions.

discussion
complex components
various positive elongation factor complexes have been described. many of those complexes have overlapping components and complex composition is variable in the literature   <cit> . therefore, genetic data can be useful for helping to determine the constituent components in biologically active complexes, or in epistatic relationships. for example, sec contains both lilli and su, while lec and aep contain either su or lilli . in our expression profiles, lilli and su positively regulate a nearly identical set of genes, which is consistent with them being obligatory co-factors in mll, sec, and eap complexes. our data does not support a role for lec or aep, although we cannot rule out the existence of these complexes. we also found that about 20% of the genes regulated by lilli and su were also regulated by cdk <dig>  this is consistent with the presence of lilli, su, and cdk <dig> in sec and eap  <cit> . however, we also found hundreds of genes positively regulated by cdk <dig> only. the genes specifically regulated by cdk <dig> might be dependent on p-tefb independently of the larger order complexes.

metabolic responses
promoter-proximal pausing of rnapii is an interesting regulatory mechanism because it allows for rapid responses. rnapii binding to the tss, unwinding the dna duplex and initiating transcription requires much more time in vivo  than elongation  per minute  <cit> ). such rapid responses are especially important for heat shock, pathogen defense, and proper expression of some developmentally regulated genes  <cit> . we found that positive elongation factors regulate many genes encoding metabolic enzymes, especially those expressed in the midgut. release from pausing is an attractive mechanism for rapidly producing enzymes in response to feeding. indeed, the jonah genes encode chymotrypsins in the midgut and are expressed in feeding, but not in non-feeding stages of development, such as the first 12 h of adult life when flies are maturing and using residual fat body stores  <cit> . in mosquitos, the orthologous genes are rapidly induced in the gut by a blood meal  <cit> . we suggest that transcriptional elongation is an important regulator of rapid metabolic gene expression responses in adult drosophila.

rapid transcription also depends on gene length. interestingly, genes positively regulated by the lilli and su genes in our studies tend to have short transcripts, especially the ones with the highest level of differential expression after perturbation. for instance, most of the transcripts of chemotrypsin genes, such as jonah genes and lambdatry, are shorter than 1 kb, which enables transcription in less than 40 s. in general, the genes positively regulated by the lilli and su genes produce even shorter transcripts than the heat shock genes . although it may not be a prerequisite, short transcript length could be a feature evolutionarily favored by genes with rapid responses. we did not observe significantly shorter transcripts among genes regulated by cdk <dig>  suggesting that regulation of short transcripts is mll-dependent.

sex-biased expression
the lilli and su loci contain many conserved and highly occupied dsx binding sites, and driving lilli
rnai or su
rnai in dsx expressing cells results in specific switches in sexual dimorphism in the male first leg and the female genitalia, suggesting that these genes are required in both females and males, but in different locations  <cit> . a sex-biased role for cdk <dig> has not been described, but the locus does have a conserved consensus dsx binding site  <cit> . however, we do not know if this sex- and tissue-specific role is confined to morphology, or is more general. we found that sex-biased expression changed for about  <dig> genes due to lilli
rnai or su
rnai, and for about  <dig> genes due to cdk9
dn
. as was the case for morphology, the lilli and su genes are required for both genes with female- and male-biased expression. this is consistent with the idea that sex-biased expression is highly context dependent and argues against strictly female- and male-biased batteries of genes that shows the same bias in all tissues. the cdk <dig> regulated genes showed a more directional effect of reduced expression in females relative to males.

many of the genes regulated by elongation factors encode metabolic functions. there is a great deal of precedent for sex-biased metabolism. for example, egg production is energy intensive and tightly linked to nutrient availability via insulin signaling  <cit> . at the morphological level, the drosophila midgut is nearly twice as long in females as males and is regulated by the sexual identity pathway  <cit> . finally, lipids and other metabolites also show dramatic sexual dimorphism  <cit> . our work suggests that some of the sex-biased gene expression in metabolic pathways is due to indirect activity of dsx target genes such as lilli and su.

CONCLUSIONS
turning down positive elongation factors has a global transcriptional effect. our data suggest that lilli and su are likely to be obligatory cofactors for the expression of many genes in soma, and that cdk <dig> has both shared and lilli/su-independent functions. our data also suggest that transcriptional elongation regulation by these factors is essential for rapid enzymatic and metabolic activities during digestion, a novel category of function regulated by rapid transcriptional elongation. in addition, the differential expression in females versus males suggests that positive elongation factors play roles in sex-biased gene regulation.
