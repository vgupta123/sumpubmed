BACKGROUND
substrate transport is vital for all living organisms, and many transporters play important roles in this process. more than  <dig> transporter families are currently documented in the transporter classification database   <cit> . these protein families are further classed into seven subclasses . in general, they have specific localizations within the cell and are specialized to carry different compounds, including nitrate, phosphate, sucrose, amino acids, peptides, hormones or metals.

the peptide transporter family consists of electrochemical potential-driven transporters that catalyze uptake of their solutes by a cation-solute symport mechanism  <cit> . in plants, peptide transporters can be classified into three distinct groups based on sequence similarity and mechanism of action, namely the atp-binding cassette family, the peptide transporter family and the oligopeptide transporter  family. the plant atp-binding cassette proteins use the energy generated by atp hydrolysis to drive the transport of substrates such as peptides, metal chelates or glutathione conjugates  <cit> . the peptide transporters have been shown to transport nitrate, and di- and tripeptides  <cit> . members of the opt family were first characterized in yeast  <cit> , and since then they have also been found in archaea, bacteria and plants. phylogenetic analyses of plant opt members have revealed two distant clades: the yellow stripe-like  proteins and the opts. the ysl transporters are involved in metal homeostasis through the translocation of metal-chelates  <cit> . the opt proteins likely do not have a common biological function and may be involved in four different processes: long-distance metal distribution  <cit> , nitrogen mobilization  <cit> , heavy metal sequestration  <cit> , and glutathione transport  <cit> . these processes may play a role in plant growth and development .

structurally, opt proteins are predicted to have about  <dig> transmembrane strands . through detailed bioinformatic analyses of these transporters, gomolplitinant and saier  <cit>  suggested that the 16-tms proteins might have arisen from a 2-tms precursor-encoding genetic element that was subject to three sequential duplication events. since the transporters are predicted to function in peptide uptake, the expansion or fusion of the tms might make excellent physiological sense in evolution.

the structural features or expression profiles of some opt homologs have been partially described in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . hoverer, there is much less information about this family in woody plant species such as populus trichocarpa  and vitis vinifera . in the present study, we performed a genome-wide identification of opt family genes in populus and vitis. detailed analyses including sequence phylogeny, gene organization, conserved motifs, expression profiling, functional divergence and adaptive evolution were performed. our results should provide a framework for further functional investigations on these genes.

RESULTS
identification of the opt gene family in populus and vitis
to identify members of the opt gene family in populus and vitis, we first searched relevant databases using the corresponding arabidopsis and rice opt protein sequences as queries. additional searches were also performed based on keyword querying. the populus and vitis sequences returned from such searches were confirmed as encoding opts using the cdd   <cit>  and pfam http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ databases. as a result of this process, we identified  <dig> opt genes in poplar  and  <dig> in vitis . the number of opt genes present in the arabidopsis and rice genomes was reported to be  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the opt genes in vitis and populus encode highly hydrophobic polypeptides  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length, with predicted pis ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the polypeptides were also predicted to contain from 8- <dig> transmembrane helices  . further analyses using the protein subcellular localization prediction software wofl psort http://wolfpsort.org enabled us to predict the probable protein localization for each of the different candidate opts in vitis and populus. it was found that all candidate opts identified in our study are most likely to be localized in the plasma or vacuolar membranes. ptopt <dig>  ptopt <dig>  vvopt <dig> and vvopt <dig> had a 100% probability of being localized to the plasma membrane. for all other opts, although the plasma membrane was predicted as the most likely location, it is also possible that they are localized to the membranes of organelles such as the chloroplast, nucleus or golgi apparatus .

phylogenetic analyses, classification and functional relatedness of the opt genes in arabidopsis, rice, populus and vitis
to examine the phylogenetic relationships among the opt genes in arabidopsis, rice, populus and vitis, we performed phylogenetic analyses of the opt protein sequences from all four species based on a maximum likelihood method using phyml  <dig>   <cit>  and bayesian analyses using phylobayes  <dig>  <cit> . our results show that the opt genes from the four higher plants consist of two major clades: the opt and ysl classes. in this study, we further divide the ysl class into six subclasses according to their phylogenetic relationships and they are designated as groups 1- <dig>  the opt class is also further divided into five subclasses, namely groups 7- <dig> . the relationships of osysl <dig> with other opt genes, however, cannot be confidently determined in our analyses: osysl <dig> was basal to a large clade consisting of groups 2- <dig> with weak support in the maximum likelihood analyses, but formed a clade with group  <dig> in bayesian analyses. therefore, osysl <dig> is not classified into any group in this study. most of the designated groups are supported by decent bootstrap values and/or posterior probabilities. moreover, other lines of evidence, such as gene structure and motif compositions as described below, also support the group classification in our analyses. groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> constitute the largest clades in the opt phylogeny, each containing  <dig> members. additionally, groups  <dig> and  <dig> form a well supported clade in the maximum likelihood analyses, suggesting that they likely evolved from a common ancestor by frequent gene duplication.

genes with same functions often are closely related and this has been confirmed in previous reports  <cit> . such a trend is also found in the opt genes. for instances, group  <dig> includes the atysl <dig> and atysl <dig> proteins, both of which are involved in metal ion homeostasis and the loading of metal ions in seeds  <cit> . atysl <dig> and atysl <dig> proteins also have dual roles in reproduction: their activity in leaves is required for normal fertility and normal seed development, while their activity in inflorescences is required for proper loading of metals into seeds  <cit> . another member in this group, osysl <dig>  has metal-nicotianamine transport activities in heterologous expression systems  <cit> . atopt <dig>  a member of group  <dig>  is able to transport glutathione derivatives and metal complexes under sulfur-deprived conditions and may be involved in stress resistance, whereas atopt <dig> of group  <dig> is not involved in stress resistance  <cit> . the high atopt <dig> expression reported in the vasculature of roots, stems and leaves also suggests that this protein is involved in long-distance peptide transport or distribution throughout the plant  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses can allow us to identify evolutionarily conservative and divergent opt genes. remarkably, groups  <dig> and  <dig> do not include any arabidopsis, vitis or populus opt proteins but contain only proteins from rice. likewise, group  <dig> does not include any rice opt proteins but contains only proteins from populus, vitis and arabidopsis. it is possible that these groups have evolved after monocot-dicot divergence and that they have specialized roles in monocots or dicots. our phylogenetic analyses also show that groups  <dig> and  <dig> contain sequences from rice, vitis and populus but not from arabidopsis, indicating that they were either acquired in rice, vitis and populus or lost in arabidopsis. although enormous evidences indicates that all these opt genes encode membrane proteins that translocate their substrates from either the extracellular environment or an organelle into the cytosol, their exact functional roles are different  <cit> . the phylogenetic analyses conducted in our study may also provide potential support for their functional differentiation. additional evidence supporting this notion comes from the tissue-specific expression profiling available on genevestigator  <cit>  and the extremely different expression pattern of opts in rice . for example, osysl <dig> is specifically highly expressed in rhizomes, suggesting a specific role in root development. while osysl <dig>  osysl <dig>  osysl <dig>  osysl <dig>  osysl <dig> and osysl <dig> show higher expression levels in pollen, indicating a key role in pollen development or reproduction.

our phylogenetic analyses also show that several pairs of opt proteins are putative paralogs . these putative paralogous opt proteins account for over  <dig> %, 40%,  <dig> % and 40% of the entire opt family in vitis, populus, arabidopsis and rice, respectively, with sequence identifies ranging from 61% to 98% . these paralogous opt members are closely related within the species, and have a very similar structure as described below , indicating that they evolved from relatively recent gene duplications. we also estimated the evolutionary dates of the segmental duplication events using ksas the proxy for time . three of the four pairs  in populus have very consistent ks values , suggesting that the duplication events in this species occurred within the last  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years. this period is consistent with the time  when a recent large-scale genome duplication event is thought to have occurred in populus  <cit> . for rice, the segmental duplication event was estimated to have occurred between  <dig>  to  <dig>  ma, following the divergence of monocots and eudicots . among them, about half of the rice opt duplication events occurred approximately when grasses originated   <cit> . it is interesting that four of the opt gene duplications  were estimated to have occurred more recently . these relatively recent duplications were not found in arabidopsis or rice. it is likely that arabidopsis and rice have subsequently suffered a high level of gene loss  <cit> .

exon-intron evolution of the opt family genes in arabidopsis, rice, populus and vitis
to investigate the mechanisms of the structural evolution of opt paralogs, we compared the exon-intron structure of individual opt genes in arabidopsis, rice, populus and vitis. figure  <dig> provides a detailed illustration of the distribution and position of introns within each of the opt paralogs. in general, the positions of some spliceosomal introns are conserved in orthologous genes from the four lineages. in many cases, not only is the intron position shared, but the intron phase is shared as well. moreover, the conservation of the exon-intron organization or gene structure in paralogous genes is usually strong and sufficient to reveal evolutionary relationships of introns  <cit> . it is clear that duplication plays an important role in the organization of genes and that intron losses have occurred frequently after segmental duplication  <cit> . our study of atopt6/atopt <dig> and osopt1/osopt <dig> duplication also suggests that this mechanism underlies the evolution of these paralogs and intron losses are associated with duplications . the phenomenon of intron loss following gene duplication also occurred in the evolution of many other genes including the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase  family  <cit> . in general, the structural diversity of gene family members provides a mechanism for the evolution of multiple gene families, while intron loss or gain can be an important step in generating structural diversity and complexity  <cit> . in this study, we analyzed the structural diversity of opt genes and found that intron loss/gain events occurred during the expansion and structural evolution of opt paralogs. we found that most opt genes in the same subgroups/clades have similar coding sequences and a very similar exon-intron structure, strongly supporting their close evolutionary relationship. the divergent gene structures in the different phylogenetic subgroups may represent gene family expansion from ancient paralogs or multiple origins of gene ancestry.

chromosomal location of the opt genes and duplication events in the genome
genome-wide duplication events, gene loss and local rearrangements have created the present complexities of the genome. to further investigate the relationship between the genetic divergence within the opt family and gene duplication and loss in the populus and vitis genomes, we determined the chromosomal location of each opt gene. the results show that the opt genes are dispersed throughout the populus and vitis genomes. three of the populus opt genes are localized to unassembled genomic sequence scaffolds and thus could not be mapped to any particular chromosome. the other opt genes are distributed unevenly among the eight chromosomes of the populus genome . five opt genes were identified on chromosome i, two on each of chromosomes iii, iv, v and xii, and only one on each of chromosomes vi and ii. for vitis,  <dig> opt genes were found on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes; three on each of chromosomes xvii and xviii, two on each of chromosomes i, ii, xvi and xix, and one on each of chromosomes iii and xiv . two other vitis opt genes could not to be assigned to a specific chromosome.

gene duplication events are thought to have frequently occurred in organismal evolution  <cit> . to investigate the relationship between the opt genes and potential gene duplications within the genome, we also compared the locations of opt genes in duplicated chromosomal blocks that were previously identified in populus, vitis, arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . the distribution of the opt genes relative to the corresponding duplicated chromosomal blocks is illustrated in populus , vitis , arabidopsis  and rice . this result suggests that segmental duplication and transposition events are not the major factors that led to the expansion of the opt gene family in the four higher plants. it may be that dynamic changes occurred following segmental duplication, leading to loss of many of the genes. interestingly, we found that some opt genes are located in tandem clusters on the chromosomes; examples are ptysl1-ptysl <dig>  ptopt8-ptopt <dig>  atopt9-atopt <dig>  osysl7-osysl <dig>  osysl2-osysl <dig>  osysl9-osysl <dig>  osysl3-osysl <dig>  osopt2-osopt <dig> and vvopt1-vvopt2-vvopt <dig> . further analyses indicate that most of the tandemly clustered opt pairs share relatively high similarities . thus, we propose that tandem duplications might have been an important factor governing the expansion of the opt gene family in these species.

conserved domains and motifs in opt proteins
the major domains of the opt proteins in populus, vitis, arabidopsis and rice were identified using cdd, pfam and smart  <cit> . our results show that all opt proteins in the four species possess only one characteristic and structurally conserved opt domain essential for their transporter activity. while these tools are suitable for defining the presence or absence of recognizable domains, they are unable to recognize smaller individual motifs and more divergent patterns. thus, we further used the program meme  <cit>  to study the diversification of opt genes in populus, vitis, arabidopsis and rice. twenty distinct motifs were identified in these genes . details of the  <dig> motifs are presented in additional file 5: sequence logo and regular expression of the different motifs identified in the opt gene family. as mentioned above, phylogenetic analyses broadly divided the opt genes from the four higher plants into two major classes, the opt class and the ysl class. noticeably, most of the closely related members in each of these two main classes have common motif compositions, suggesting functional similarities among the opt proteins within the same class . most members of opt class possess  <dig> motifs, while most members of ysl class have  <dig> motifs. three of the motifs  are shared by all opt proteins. whether the motifs that are specific to the opt class  or to the ysl class  confer unique functional roles to the opts remains to be further investigated. in any case, the conserved motifs in the opt proteins from the same class may provide additional support to results of the phylogenetic analyses. on the other hand, the divergence in motif composition among different classes may indicate that they are functionally diversified.

differential expression profiles of the populus and vitis opt genes
expression profiling can provide useful clues to gene functions. to examine the expression patterns of the opt genes, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis using some of the publicly available microarray data for populus and vitis. in general, the expression levels of most opt genes in populus peaked in shoot apices, roots and internode  <dig> . because these are the growing points of plants, they are likely to need more nutrients to ensure plant growth and differentiation. because opts are membrane-localized proteins and have a broad range of substrate transport capabilities, higher expression of opts in these parts might contribute to many growth and developmental processes. some opts seem not to follow this trend. for example, ptopt <dig> displayed especially high expression levels in internode  <dig> 

grape and wine production is strongly affected by environmental cues during the development of the plant. here, we also investigated the expression pattern of the opt genes in response to some abiotic stresses. because sunshine duration can affect the quality of fruits, long daylight hours will cause grape plants to produce more carbohydrates . microarray data indicate that some opts vary considerably in their expression levels when exposed to long daylight  or short daylight  . vvopt <dig>  vvysl <dig> and vvysl <dig> showed higher expression levels in ld compared with in sd. one possible explanation may be that, in ld conditions, grape plants need more transporters  to transport more oligonucleotide peptides for increased carbohydrate synthesis. we also examined the expression patterns of the vitis opts under different stress conditions. interestingly, several genes such as vvysl <dig> and vvysl <dig> showed low expression levels when treated with aba, whereas a subset of genes including vvysl <dig>  vvopt <dig> and vvopt <dig> displayed high expression levels under salt stress . similarly, several genes such as vvopt <dig> and vvysl <dig> demonstrated depressed expression patterns in cold conditions. we further selected four growth phases of the fruit to investigate the different expression of the opt genes in the fruit maturing process. these four phases were green hard berry, green soft berry, pink soft berry and red soft berry. as shown in figure 5b, different expression levels of the opts genes were found in the four different growth phases of the fruit, suggesting divergent functions of the opt members in the maturing process.

duplicated genes may have different evolutionary fates  <cit> , which can be indicated by divergence in their expression patterns. because tandem duplications may have governed the expansion of the opt gene family, we also investigated the expression profiles of the duplicated opt gene pairs identified above in populus and vitis. our results show that none of the gene pairs share similar expression patterns , indicating that substantial neofunctionalization may have occurred during the subsequent evolution of the duplicated genes. it seems that the expression patterns of the paralogs have diverged during long-term evolution, suggesting functional diversification of the duplicated genes  <cit> . such a process may increase the adaptability of duplicated genes to environmental changes, thus conferring a possible evolutionary advantage.

analysis of functional divergence
next, we investigated whether amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved opt domain could have caused adaptive functional diversification. type-i functional divergence between gene clusters of the opt family was estimated by posterior analysis using the program diverge  <cit> , which evaluate the shifted evolutionary rate and altered amino acid properties. comparisons of thirty-five pairs of paralogous members and class opt/class ysl proteins were carried out and the rate of amino acid evolution at each sequence position was estimated. our results indicate that the coefficient of all functional divergence  values between these groups or classes is less than  <dig> . these observations indicate that there were significantly site-specific altered selective constraints on most members of the opt family, leading to group-specific functional evolution after diversification. moreover, critical amino acid residues responsible for the functional divergence were predicted based on site-specific profiles in combination with suitable cut-off values derived from the posterior probability of each comparison. the results indicate distinct differences in the number and distribution of predicted sites for functional divergence within each pair. for example, no critical amino acid site was predicted for the sequences in the group 2/ <dig>  4/ <dig> and 9/ <dig> pairs , while over  <dig> critical amino acids sites were predicted for group 2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  5/ <dig>  5/ <dig>  5/ <dig>  5/ <dig>  5/ <dig>  6/ <dig>  6/ <dig>  6/ <dig> and 6/ <dig> pairs. interestingly, when the opt sequences in the opt and ysl classes were compared, thirty-one critical amino acid sites were predicted for group 6/ <dig> pairs. when a cut-off value of  <dig>  was applied, only four substitution sites were predicted, implying a lower evolutionary rate between the two pairs.

during a long period of evolution, the different evolutionary rates at specific amino acid sites within each pair might promote the functional divergence of opt subfamilies. in table  <dig>  we also find that higher theta values  exist in group 2/ <dig>  and group 2/ <dig> , indicating a higher evolutionary rate or site-specific selective relaxation between them. an example of the residues predicted to be functionally divergent was mapped onto the topology models of the group 7/ <dig> members . the predicted functional sites are not equally distributed throughout the opt sequence, but are distributed in different α-helices and β-strands. the functions of these sites need to be experimentally verified. thus, the results of the functional divergence analysis suggest that, because of the different evolutionary rates predicted at some amino acid sites, the opt genes may be significantly divergent from each other in their functions. perhaps, amino acid mutations have spurred the opt family genes to evolve new functions after divergence and hence, functional divergence might reflect the existence of long-term selective pressures.

variable selective pressures among amino acid sites
the ka/ksratio measures selection pressure on amino acid substitutions. a ka/ksratio greater than  <dig> suggests positive selection and a ratio less than  <dig> suggests purifying selection. the amino acids in a protein sequence are expected to be under different selective pressures and to have different underlying ka/ksratios. to analyze positive or negative selection of specific amino acid sites within the full-length sequences of the opt proteins in the different opt groups, substitution rate ratios of nonsynonymous  versus synonymous  mutations were calculated with the selecton server http://selecton.tau.ac.il using a bayesian inference approach  <cit> . the results show that the ka/ksratios of the sequences from the different opt groups are significantly different . however, despite the differences in ka/ksvalues, all the estimated ka/ksvalues are substantially lower than  <dig>  suggesting that the opt sequences within each of the groups are under strong purifying selection pressure and that positive selection may have acted only on a few sites during the evolutionary process. we performed the tests using the m <dig> , and m <dig>  models. the selection model m <dig> does not indicate the presence of positively selected sites, whereas the m <dig> model does . it is thus clear that, while most of the protein sequence is subjected to constant purifying selection, a few sites undergo positive selection. the detailed distribution of the positive-selection sites in group  <dig> sequences as predicted by the m <dig> model are showed in figure 7c. further analyses indicate that six of the  <dig> positive selection sites in the group  <dig> sequences are in α-helices . interestingly, more than half of all the predicted positive-selection sites  are in the β <dig> β-strand  and in the α <dig> helix . these observations suggest that positive selection pressure on the β-strands  and α-helices  might have accelerated functional divergence and the formation of the multiple subgroups. a few additional positively selected sites are distributed in other α-helices , suggesting that these residues might be important in maintaining the conformational stability of the proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a comparative genome analysis addressing phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene structure, expression profiling, functional divergence and selective pressures of the opt gene family in populus and vitis. phylogenetic analyses revealed two well-supported classes in the opt family, each of which can be further classified into  <dig> to  <dig> distinct groups. the exon/intron structure and motif compositions of the opt genes and proteins are highly conserved in each class and in each of the groups, indicative of their functional conservation. the opts genes are non-randomly distributed across the populus and vitis chromosomes, and a high proportion of the opt genes may be derived from tandem duplications. an additional comprehensive analysis of the expression profiles has provided insights into the possible functional divergence among members of the opt gene family. furthermore, functional divergence analyses suggest that significant site-specific selective constraints may have acted on most opt paralogs after gene duplication, leading to subgroup-specific functional evolution. these data may provide valuable information for future functional investigations of this gene family.
