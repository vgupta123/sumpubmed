BACKGROUND
burkholderia cenocepacia is a gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and formerly genomovar iii of burkholderia cepacia complex . the bcc comprises at least  <dig> taxonomically related species  <cit> , which have developed diverse niches from the natural environment  <cit>  and humans as they have emerged as pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis , chronic granulomatous disease, and in immunocompromised individuals  <cit> . b. cenocepacia is the dominant bcc species in patients with cf, accounting for between 50% and 80% of the infection cases  <cit> . it also causes many instances of non-cf clinical infections, such as for cancer patients  <cit> . as a representative isolate for the spread of an epidemic cf strain, b. cenocepacia j <dig> belongs to a clonal lineage known as et <dig>  which is of increased transmissibility and dominates fatal infections among cf patients in the united kingdom and canada  <cit> . b. cenocepacia j <dig> is notorious for its high resistance to the majority of clinically useful antimicrobial agents  <cit> , including antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . yet the mechanisms of host infection and drug resistance remain mostly unknown.

the genome of b. cenocepacia j <dig> has been sequenced and recently annotated  <cit> . it is one of the largest gram-negative genomes consisting of three circular chromosomes with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million base pairs  respectively and a plasmid. its complex genome encodes a broad range of metabolic capabilities, and numerous virulence and drug resistance functions that allow it to survive under a variety of conditions and invade immunocompromised individuals. it is vital to develop a systems-level metabolic model for this opportunistic human pathogen to explore and gain insights into its versatile metabolic capability and disease-causing mechanism, and eventually aid in finding potential clinical therapeutic targets. the genome-scale metabolic reconstruction enables integration of genomic information with metabolic activities observed in phenotypic experiments and other "omics" measurements to elicit hidden biological knowledge that would have been otherwise difficult to obtain.

in this study, we presented the manually curated genome-scale metabolic network of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  named as ikf <dig>  which accounts for the major metabolic pathways for the synthesis of each component of biomass and for the degradation of common biologically important carbon sources. syntheses pathways for key virulence factors highly associated with metabolism were particularly emphasized and reconstructed. the in silico model was validated by performing biolog substrate utilization assays, which can test the ability of a microorganism to oxidize various substrates simultaneously  <cit> . model-driven analysis and discoveries, including refinement of gene annotation, and gene and enzyme essentiality, were carried out to define the architecture of the genome-wide metabolic and transport network and assist the identification of potential drug targets. model ikf <dig> provides researchers a framework to explore and understand the global metabolism of b. cenocepacia j <dig> and its key metabolic virulence factors affecting cf patients upon infection. it allows a broad spectrum of basic and practical applications, especially the application for drug design which may open new doors for anti-infection strategies.

RESULTS

the genome-scale reconstructed metabolic model of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  referred by the conventional naming rules  <cit>  as ikf <dig>  consists of  <dig> internal reactions  and  <dig> metabolites. the reconstruction accounts for  <dig>  genes, covering  <dig> % of the  <dig>  protein coding genes identified from whole genome sequencing . the model ikf <dig> includes all major pathways required for cell growth and the degradation of common biologically important carbon sources of b. cenocepacia. apart from these central metabolic pathways, model ikf <dig> also includes pathways associated with key metabolic virulence factors, which provides insights into how the system-level metabolic properties affect pathogenicity. for an overview, the properties of the j <dig> genome and the reconstructed model ikf <dig> were summarized in table  <dig>  genome-scale metabolic models have been successfully used to study many pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , acinetobacter baumannii  <cit> , mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , salmonella typhimurium  <cit> , and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . a basic comparison between the model ikf <dig> and the above five recently published metabolic reconstructions is also illustrated in table  <dig>  schematic representation of the metabolic network of b. cenocepacia j <dig> with key metabolic virulence factors is shown in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> enumerates the metabolic pathways included in ikf <dig> and, for each pathway, the number of reactions with assigned and non-assigned genes. the high ratio of gene-associated reactions shows that the reconstructed metabolic model of b. cenocepacia j <dig> is reliable.

metabolic virulence factors in model ikf1028
the success of b. cenocepacia as a pathogen originates from the ability of its large genome to encode numerous virulence mechanisms  <cit> , including quorum sensing   <cit> , siderophores-based iron uptake systems  <cit> , cable pili and adhesion  <cit> , motility  <cit> , hemolysin  <cit> , zmpa and zmpb proteases  <cit> , phospholipases  <cit> , secretion systems  <cit> , lipopolysaccharides   <cit> , and extracellular capsule  <cit> . syntheses of the key metabolic virulence factors of these virulent mechanisms, namely qs, lps and rhamnolipids, were incorporated and analyzed in ikf <dig>  table  <dig> lists the virulence-associated pathways and the required proteins and precursors for syntheses of virulence factors in each pathway.

the lps produced by b. cenocepacia j <dig> has an important role in both disease aetiology and antibiotic resistance  <cit> . lps usually consists of three components: lipid a, core oligosaccharide, and o antigen. although there were some studies on characterizing the features of lps in b. cenocepacia, all these studies focused on a certain part/component of lps. so far, there is no systematic elucidation of the lps structure and composition specifically for b. cenocepacia strain j <dig>  nor any global analysis on its biosynthesis process of the lps. in this study, we depicted the detailed features of the complete lps structure in b. cenocepacia j <dig> by integrating all available reports on lps. we also reconstructed the lps-synthesis pathways supplemented with all necessary proteins involved and major metabolic precursors, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  according to our study, in j <dig>  each of the three components has a very unique feature. the lipid a portion is modified by an additional ara4n residue  <cit> , which had been shown to reduce the binding of cationic antibiotics and was proposed as a potential drug target  <cit> . the inner core oligosaccharide contains an unusual kdo-ko-ara4n residue instead of the typical kdo-kdo residue  <cit> . the outer core comprises various polysaccharides including l-glycero-d-manno-heptose, glucose, galactose, quinovosamine, and rhamnose  <cit> . the o-antigen portion of lps in j <dig> was interrupted by an insertion element in bcal <dig>  <cit> . these differences might indicate the reason why strain j <dig> is of remarkably distinct activity.

b. cenocepacia strains possess multiple quorum sensing systems, which regulate the expression of versatile virulence determinants, such as biofilm formation and motility. strain j <dig> owns the ability to synthesize and recognize three types of chemical signals used for cell-to-cell communication: n-acylhomoserine lactones , 4-quinolones , and the dsf-like molecule cis-2-dodecenoic acid . two ahls-based qs systems have been found in j <dig>  namely cciir and cepir  <cit> , which can both produce n-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone  and n-octanoyl-l-homoserine lactone  signals using acyl side chain  and s-adenosyl-methionine  as precursors  <cit> . the cepir system is conserved in all species of the bcc. the cciir system is encoded within a pathogenicity island, designated as the b. cenocepacia island , which was the first time that cell-signalling genes were found on a genomic island  <cit> . the 4qs-based signal, the 2-heptyl-4-quinolone , is produced by b. cenocepacia strains  <cit> . hhq is the precursor of 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone   <cit>  and its synthesis requires four proteins: pqsa, pqsb, pqsc, and pqsd. it had been reported that the exported hhq from b. cenocepacia can be recognized by pseudomonas aeruginosa within which hhq is converted into pqs which is one of the qs signals for p. aeruginosa  <cit> , highlighting the possibility of inter-species communication during the cf co-infection caused by p. aeruginosa and b. cenocepacia. bdsf is a newly discovered signal molecule produced by b. cenocepacia  <cit> . the synthesis of bdsf requires the gene bcam <dig>  <cit> .

the synthesis pathway of rhamnolipids was also reconstructed in ikf <dig>  although there has not been any report demonstrating that b. cenocepacia can produce rhamnolipid, dubeau et al demonstrated that burkholderia thailandensis has the orthologs of rhla, rhlb, and rhlc, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . by protein similarity search against the uniprot database, proteins coded by genes bcam <dig>  bcam <dig>  and bcam <dig> in b. cenocepacia j <dig> were identified as highly similar in sequence to rhla, rhlb, and rhlc in both b. thailandensis  and p. aeruginosa . this facilitates us to hypothesize that b. cenocepacia can potentially generate rhamnolipids. further experimental investigations are needed.

model validation and gap-filling using phenotype data
biolog substrates utilization assays for b. cenocepacia j <dig> were performed in triplicates in order to validate and refine the model. in silico growth on various substrates was simulated by setting each of them as sole carbon source and its uptake rate to  <dig> mmol/gcell/h under aerobic conditions based on m <dig> minimal medium. the simulation was performed on the tobin platform by flux balance analysis, as described in methods. of the  <dig> carbon sources tested,  <dig> could be directly compared with the in silico model of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  ikf <dig>  preliminary disagreement between biolog assays and in silico predictions were probably due to metabolic gaps, improper gene annotations and unacquainted transporters. these discrepancies were checked through gap analysis and literature mining. after continuous gap-filling and network refinement, the overall prediction accuracy was improved to  <dig> %, a value that supported ikf <dig> as being a proper reconstruction of the b. cenocepacia j <dig> core metabolism .

of the remaining  <dig> carbon sources tested,  <dig> were indirectly compared with the model due to the missing knowledge of whether the transport mechanisms of these compounds exist in j <dig> or not. initially, all those  <dig> carbon sources showed a no-growth phenotype both in silico and in the biolog assays. then we made the assumption that each of these carbon sources could be transported into the cell  and re-tested whether the in silico model can grow on each of them. the results showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> carbon sources enabled ikf <dig> to grow after applying the above assumption. this supports the hypothesis that j <dig> lacks of transporters for all those  <dig> carbon sources, even though their catabolic pathways are complete. for the rest  <dig> carbon sources, the agreement between the in silico results and biolog assays remained.

as the catabolism of the remaining  <dig> carbon sources out of  <dig> has not been well studied and information regarding their role in the cell could not be found in public resources, these  <dig> carbon sources cannot be analyzed in our model. 

model-driven refinement of genome annotation
the reconstruction of metabolic network allowed the identification and refinement of improperly annotated genes of b. cenocepacia j <dig> from the public biological databases. careful effort was made in this work to rectify the current genome annotation based on metabolic gap analysis, blast searches, biolog substrate utilization assays, and literature mining. the full list of refinement of genome annotation derived from the genome-scale metabolic reconstruction is shown in table  <dig> 

the first type of refinement was to re-annotate genes in ikf <dig> - based on literature evidence and blast searches - that have been improperly annotated. an example is the gene bcal <dig>  which was annotated in both the burkholderia genome database and kegg as a "hypothetical protein", but that was now reassigned coding for an "ornithine n-acyltransferase". it was reported that the outer membrane of "b. cepacia"  <cit>  possesses unusual polar lipids, ornithine amide lipids   <cit> . in addition, the protein olsb is required for the first step of ol biosynthesis  <cit> . by blast searches of olsb against the uniprot database, the gene bcal <dig> of b. cenocepacia j <dig> was identified with high similarity.

another type of annotation refinement was based on gap analyses, which pinpointed reactions for which the gene products involved were missing. for instance, we identified a missing reaction that should be catalyzed by ispe and that takes part in the biosynthesis of polyprenyl-pp, a necessary precursor of the ubiquinone biosynthesis. the ispe encoding genes for other strains of b. cenocepacia  could be identified in the burkholderia genome database and kegg. by querying genedb, we found that the genomic location from  <dig> to  <dig>  named bcal <dig>  was not assigned any function in the above two databases. a blast search of bcal <dig> against the uniprot database revealed a perfect match with ispe from other b. cenocepacia strains. consequently, bcal <dig> is annotated as a 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase and this missing reaction was supplemented into the model ikf <dig>  this example exemplifies how the reconstruction process can drive the reconciliation of isolated data from different biological databases.

biolog substrate utilization assays have already been successfully used on the refinement of metabolic reconstructions  <cit> . it is an efficient approach for gap analysis and refinement of genome annotation. for example, in our study we can highlight the case for the substrate d-galactose, associated in biolog assays with a growth phenotype. from that result we inferred that j <dig> should contain a transport mechanism for d-galactose. by homology searches of mgla, mglb, and mglc, which are galactose-binding proteins conveying galactose into the cell, gene bcal <dig> , bcal <dig> , and bcal <dig>  were identified and they had been annotated as a putative sugar abc transporter atp-binding protein, a putative ribose abc transport system, and a putative sugar transport system permease protein respectively. the ordering of mglb, mgla, and mglc is consistent with a) previous studies indicating that the mgl operon contains three genes and the genes are transcribed in the order of mglb, mgla, and mglc  <cit>  and b) mgla and mglc being located downstream of mglb  <cit> . as a result, the annotations of bcal1431- <dig> were refined to account for the galactose transport. in total,  <dig> genes were reannotated based on biolog assays.

gene essentiality analysis
the term 'essential gene' means a gene for which knockout is lethal  under certain conditions   <cit> . identification of essential genes is helpful to understand the basic functions required for survival and it is an efficient way to discover novel targets for new antimicrobial therapies. here in this study, ikf <dig> was used as a framework to predict computationally identified essential genes in b. cenocepacia j <dig> on both m <dig> minimal medium and synthetic cf medium . about 19%  and 15%  of the  <dig>  metabolic genes included in ikf <dig> were predicted to be essential on m <dig> and scfm media, respectively. there are more genes predicted as essentials on m <dig> than on scfm, which indicates the influence of the living environment on the bacterium.  <dig> overlapping predictions were on both media. these essential genes are unequally located on the three chromosomes and most of the essential genes are located on chromosome  <dig> . this result agrees with known features of the j <dig> genome: chromosome  <dig> contains a higher proportion of coding sequence  involved in central metabolism and other house-keeping functions, whereas chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> contain a greater proportion of cds encoding accessory functions  <cit> .

to assess the predictive potential of the model, we compared the in silico essential genes predicted on scfm with experimental essentiality data for p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  <cit>  since there is no experimental gene essentiality data available for b. cenocepacia. as both p. aeruginosa and b. cenocepacia are cf pathogens, and b. cenocepacia was historically classified under the genus pseudomonas  <cit> , it is possible that partial similarity exists between them. scfm was chosen due to its similarity to the nutritional composition of sputum from cf patients. the common set of the essential genes from two p. aeruginosa strains was chosen for comparison in order to reduce the effect of strain-dependent variation. totally, there are  <dig> in silico essential metabolic and non-metabolic genes of b. cenocepacia j <dig> with high similarity to the common set of p. aeruginosa by blast searches, of which  <dig> in vivo essential genes are present in ikf <dig>  genes in the in vivo essential set but not in the ikf <dig> were assumed to be involved either in non-metabolic functions or in accessory functions of metabolism. a total of 55%  of the in silico predicted essential genes agreed with the in vivo essential genes based on gene homology with p. aeruginosa .

based on gene essentiality analysis, the genome-scale metabolic model of b. cenocepacia was further refined. for example, bcal <dig> and bcal <dig>  which were homologous genes encoding protein accc according to their annotation, were originally both included in the model with the gene-protein-reaction  relationship of "bcal <dig> or bcal3421". through in silico gene deletion study, bcal <dig> is identified as non-essential, which is inconsistent with the in vivo essential gene results. such discrepancy was subject to further analysis. acca, accb, accc, and accd were four subunits of acetyl-coa carboxylase  catalyzing the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . the gene accb, of which the locus in j <dig> is bcal <dig>  is frequently adjacent to the gene accc and both genes are cotranscribed and form an operon together  <cit> . furthermore, bcal <dig> and bcal <dig> shows greater than 2-fold expression for j <dig> under cf conditions versus soil conditions, yet bcal <dig> shows an opposite result  <cit> . taken together, bcal <dig> was excluded from model ikf <dig>  further studies are necessary to validate the function of bcal <dig> 

identification of essential enzymes and potential drug targets
essential enzyme/protein refers to a gene product  for which individual deletion  is lethal under certain conditions. through fba using ikf <dig> we could obtain a collection of essential enzymes , based on which  <dig> essential enzymes were identified as potential drug targets and supported by experimental evidences from literatures. there are  <dig> of them which were also predicted as drug targets for p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  <cit> . all the  <dig> targets are nonhomologous to human protein sequences and thus could serve as potential candidate antibiotic drug targets for cf patients infected by both b. cenocepacia j <dig> and p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  among  <dig> targets, there are  <dig> targets, namely acca, accb, accc, accd, mura, folp, phoa, ribe, and ribh, which have approved drugs in the drugbank database  <cit> .

the other  <dig> potential targets, namely arnt, arnb, arnc, arna <dig>  arna <dig>  and ugd are unique in b. cenocepacia j <dig>  arnt, arnb, arnc, arna <dig>  and arna <dig> are necessary proteins required for the synthesis of ara4n, which is an additional moiety of lps specially presented in b. cenocepacia j <dig>  ara4n is essential for the viability of b. cenocepacia j <dig> and significantly contributes to high resistance to antimicrobial peptides   <cit> . amps have been proposed as agents for treating cf infections  <cit> . it had also been demonstrated that arnc transposon mutant was survival-defective and attenuated in infected rats  <cit> . the udp-glucose dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the conversion of udp-glucose to udp-glucuronic acid and is the initial step in the synthesis of udp-ara4n, is also necessary for the viability of b. cenocepacia and its resistance to polymyxin b  <cit> . these targets are potentially useful for designing strategies against b. cenocepacia j <dig>  further studies are necessary to test their applicability. an overview of the  <dig> proposed targets is given in table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we reconstructed the first manually curated genome-scale metabolic network of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  a gram-negative pathogen for cf patients. an iterative reconstruction process led to the establishment of the model, termed ikf <dig>  which captures the important metabolic capabilities and biosynthesis of key metabolic virulence factors. the model ikf <dig> shows its predictive potential when compared with biolog assays. model-driven analyses on gene annotation refinement and identification of gene and enzyme essentiality analyses are helpful to understand the genome and discover promising novel drug targets. through careful investigation, we proposed  <dig> enzymes that catalyze reactions predicted to be essential for growth with priority to be considered as drug targets. the model will keep being further validated and improved with experimentally determined biomass composition, large-scale gene deletion experimental data, proteome, and metabolome data, as they become available for b. cenocepacia. the model herein developed provides a valuable tool to explore the metabolic space of b. cenocepacia, to describe its metabolic wiring under a range of conditions, to pinpoint possible targets and to generate testable hypotheses. taken together, our study underlined the value of the model ikf <dig> as a framework to systematically study the metabolic capabilities of b. cenocepacia and its metabolic virulence factors affecting the cf community.
