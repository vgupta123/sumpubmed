BACKGROUND
uterine cervical cancer is the third most common cancer, and is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in young women worldwide . over  <dig>  new cases and  <dig>  death in global are reported each year  <cit> . several treatment strategies, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and combined radio-chemotherapy were used in the clinic depending on the stage of cancer, and overall survival rate was improved. however, treatment failure and poor outcome occurs, especially in advanced stage of cervical cancer, due to the development of resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy  <cit> . thus, identification of new potential therapeutic targets in cervical cancer is necessary for improving the treatment and prognosis.

micrornas , endogenous non-coding rna molecules, modulate multiple important biological processes, including cell development, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, signal transduction, and tumorigenesis, via regulation of genes expression  <cit> . dysregulation of mirna expression is commonly observed in human malignancies and has been reported to promote the cancer progression. aberrant expression of oncogenic and tumor suppressive mirnas was detected in cervical cancer cell lines and they are required for tumor cell growth  <cit> . a study has identified  <dig> up-regulated mirnas including mir- <dig> in the invasive cervical squamous cell carcinomas as compared with normal samples  <cit> . upregulated mir <dig> expression was also found in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, a well-defined precursor stages of squamous cell carcinomas  <cit> . indeed, higher expression of mir- <dig> was found in many solid cancer types, such as gastric cancer, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, as well as cervical cancer . mir- <dig> promotes the proliferation of gastric cancer and lung cancer cells through negative regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene early growth response factor  <dig>  and by targeting p <dig>  respectively, suggesting its pro-tumorigenic function  <cit> . multiple targets of mir- <dig> including mucins  <dig> , zinc‑finger e‑box binding homeobox  <dig> , egr <dig>  p <dig>  p2x purinoceptor  <dig> , src kinase signaling inhibitor  <dig> , bri1‑associated receptor kinase  <dig> , and c-myb, were also identified in several cancer cells and these targets are involved in the cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis . however, the functions of mir- <dig> in the development of cervical cancer remain unclear.

in the present study, we demonstrate the elevated expression of mir- <dig> in cervical carcinoma as compared with para-carcinoma tissues and normal tissue from healthy donors, and that increased mir- <dig> expression is associated with the processed stages of cancer. our data indicate that mir- <dig> targets foxo <dig> and regulates multiple proliferation- and apoptosis-related proteins, therefore, promoting cervical cell survival and growth.

RESULTS
elevated expression of mir- <dig> in cervical cancer
mir- <dig> dysregulation has been found in several solid tumors including gastric cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer  <cit> , whereas the relationship between mir- <dig> expression and cervical cancer has not been well studied. here, we first compared the mir- <dig> expression in cervical carcinoma and para-carcinoma tissues obtained from  <dig> patients and significantly higher expression of mir- <dig> was observed in carcinoma cells . moreover, the expression of mir- <dig> in the cervical carcinoma of cancer patients was significantly higher than that in normal cervical tissue from healthy donors . the level of mir- <dig> expression in cervical tissue was increased along with the stage progression and a  <dig> times higher mir- <dig> expression was found in the advanced stage of cervical cancer . a human cervical carcinoma cell line c-33a also expressed a high level of mir- <dig>  as compared with normal donors. these results suggest a close relationship between mir- <dig> expression and cervical carcinoma.fig.  <dig> cervical cancer cells express higher level of mir- <dig>  a mir- <dig> expression was measured in cervical carcinoma and para-carcinoma tissues from the patients  by rt-pcr. the mir- <dig> expression in cervical carcinoma tissue normalized to that in paired para-carcinoma tissues is presented by a histogram. b mir- <dig> expression in cervical tissue from healthy donors  or in cervical carcinoma tissue from patients  was determined by rt-pcr and the relative mir- <dig> expression is presented after normalization to healthy donors. c the mir- <dig> expression in cervical tissue from healthy donors  or in cervical carcinoma tissue from  <dig> patients at different stages , as well as in a human cervical carcinoma cell line c-33a, was evaluated by rt-pcr



mir- <dig> promotes the survival of cervical cancer cells
mir- <dig> has been reported to be involved in cancer cell growth and apoptosis and we next determined the functions of mir- <dig> in cervical carcinoma cells. c-33a cells were transfected with sirna control, mir- <dig> mimics or inhibitors and cultured in serum free medium for 48 h. thereafter, the apoptosis in these cells were determined by tunel assay. as shown in fig. 2a, b, clearly decrease of apoptosis  was observed in the cells transfected with mir- <dig> mimics, whereas the mir- <dig> inhibitors induced more apoptotic cells , indicating the positive function of mir- <dig> in cervical carcinoma cell survival.fig.  <dig> mir- <dig> promotes the survival of cervical carcinoma cells. a c-33a cells were transfected with sirna control, or mir- <dig> mimics  or inhibitors for 48 h and the apoptosis was determined by tunel assay and pi staining. representative pictures of the tunel assays are presented. b the percentage of tunel-positive cells was counted and presented by a histogram. mean values ± standard deviation  for  <dig> independent experiments is shown



mir- <dig> facilitates cervical cancer cell growth
to further investigate the roles of mir- <dig> in cervical carcinoma cells, two sub-cell lines of c-33a consistently expressing mir- <dig> mimics or inhibitors and a control cell line were established. overexpression of mir- <dig> in the cell lines expressing mir- <dig> mimics was confirmed by rt-pcr . the growth of these three cell lines were determined next and the cells expressing mir- <dig> mimics were growing faster than the control and the cells expressing mir- <dig> inhibitors , whereas the cells expressing mir- <dig> inhibitors were growing slower than the control . cell cycle of these three cell lines was evaluated next and higher level of cell at s phase was observed in mir- <dig> mimic-expressing cells . overexpression of mir- <dig> inhibitors induces more cell cycle arrest at the g1/g <dig> phase . these findings indicate that mir- <dig> promotes the cervical cancer cell growth and cell cycle progression from the g1/g <dig> to s phase.fig.  <dig> mir- <dig> promotes the growth of cervical carcinoma cells. a the expression of mir- <dig> in non-transduction c-33a cells  or stable cells after transduction with control virus  or virus containing mir- <dig> mimics  was analyzed by rt-pcr. the bar represents  <dig> independent experiments. b same number of c-33a cells expressing mir- <dig> mimics or inhibitors, or empty vector-transducted c-33a cells  were seeded into 24-well plate and cultured for 4 days. the cell number was counted every day. mean values ± sd for  <dig> independent experiments is shown. c the cell cycle analysis in the three stable c-33a sub-cell lines was performed after pi staining and representative dna content profiles of cell cycle are presented. d the percentages of cells in different cell cycle stages from  <dig> independent experiments were analyzed and presented by a histogram



mir- <dig> regulates the expression of proteins related to cell proliferation and apoptosis in cervical cancer cells
since mir- <dig> promotes the survival and cell cycle progression, expression of several related proteins was determined next in the three sub-cell lines. mrna expression of two cell cycle-related genes cyclind <dig> and p <dig>  as well as two cell apoptosis-related genes fasl and bim, was measured by qrt-pcr. mir- <dig> mimics significant upregulated cyclind <dig> mrna expression and reduced the mrna expression of p <dig>  fasl, and bim . in contrast, mir- <dig> inhibitors decreased the cyclind <dig> expression and increased the expression of p <dig>  fasl, and bim . consistent with mrna results, the protein level of cyclind <dig> was increased by mir- <dig> mimics and reduced by mir- <dig> inhibitors, whereas protein levels of p <dig>  fasl, and bim were reduced by mir- <dig> mimics and increased by mir- <dig> inhibitors . moreover, the phosphorylated prb, a regulator of cell cycle, was increased by mir- <dig> and decreased by mir- <dig> inhibitors .fig.  <dig> mir- <dig> affects the expression of proteins involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. a the mrna expression of cell cycle-related genes cyclind <dig> and p <dig> in the three c-33a sub-cell lines  was measured by rt-pcr. mean values ± sd for  <dig> independent experiments is shown. b the mrna expression of apoptosis-related genes fasl and bim in these three sub-cell lines from  <dig> independent experiments was evaluated by rt-pcr. mean values ± sd for  <dig> independent experiments are shown. c the expression of cyclin d <dig>  p <dig>  gapdh, and phophorylated prb  in the sub-cell lines was determined by western blot, and the pixel densities of these proteins were analyzed and presented by histograms . mean values ± sd for  <dig> independent experiments is shown. d the expression of fasl, bim, and gapdh in the sub-cell lines was determined by western blot, and the pixel densities of these proteins were analyzed from  <dig> independent experiments and presented by histograms 



mir- <dig> targets foxo <dig> in cervical cancer cells
mirna plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and other biological processes by targeting the 3′utr site of multiple genes, therefore regulating their transcription. foxo <dig> is a predicted target gene of mir- <dig>  and we found significant downregulation of foxo <dig> in c-33a cells expressing mir- <dig> mimics and the upregulation of foxo <dig> in the cells expressing mir- <dig> inhibitors . to confirm that mir- <dig> directly targets the 3′utr of foxo <dig>  two luciferase reporter plasmids containing wild type or mutant 3′ utr were constructed . in c-33a cells overexpressing mir- <dig>  the luciferase activity regulated by wild type 3′utr of foxo <dig> was significantly reduced and mir- <dig> inhibitors increased the luciferase activity . moreover, mir- <dig> mimics and inhibitors did not affect luciferase activity regulated by mutant 3′utr of foxo <dig> , indicating that mir- <dig> directly targets foxo <dig> fig.  <dig> mir- <dig> directly targets the 3′utr of foxo <dig>  a the expression of foxo <dig> in three c-33a sub-cell lines was determined by western blot. b the sequence of the wild type and mutant 3′ utr of foxo <dig>  for luciferase reporter assay are shown. c three c-33a sub-cell lines were transfected with reporter plasmids containing wild type or mutant 3′utr of foxo <dig> for 48 h and the luciferase activity was measured. mean values ± sd for  <dig> independent experiments is shown. d hypothetic illustration of how mir- <dig> promotes cervical cancer cell cycle progression and survival by targeting foxo4



discussion
although a variety of altered mirnas have been identified in cervical carcinomas, their underlying functions and mechanisms in cervical cancer development have not been fully studied. among  <dig> dysregulated mirnas identified in cervical carcinomas, mir- <dig> is upregulated by above  <dig>  times as compared with healthy donors  <cit> . our results add further information about the correlation between increased mir- <dig> and cervical cancer progression. importantly, we observed pro-cancer effects of mir <dig> as mir- <dig> promotes cervical cancer growth and survival. here, foxo <dig> is identified as a direct target of mir- <dig> which also regulates the expression of cyclind <dig>  p <dig>  bim, and fasl, as well as the phosphorylation of prb. based on the fact that activated foxo <dig> directly or indirectly regulates the expression of cyclind <dig>  p <dig>  bim, and fasl , we propose a hypothesis that mir- <dig> induces the transcriptional arrest of foxo <dig> by binding to 3′-utr of its mrna, therefore reduces p <dig>  fasl, bim and prb activation, and increases cyclind <dig>  finally leading to cell cycle progression and survival . our findings highlight the involvement and crucial role of mir- <dig> in cervical cancer development.

it has been well documented that aberrant expression of mir- <dig> is associated with cancer development and progression through regulating oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes . different features of mir- <dig> expression in different solid cancer types have been shown in many studies. decreased level of mir- <dig> has been found in pancreatic cancer  <cit> , esophageal cancer  <cit> , colorectal cancer , and liver cancer  <cit> , while elevated expression of mir- <dig> has been found in gastric cancer  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit> , and non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> . previous studies  <cit> , together with our finding here, confirm that mir- <dig> is upregulated in cervical cancer. moreover, our data demonstrated that increased mir- <dig> expression is also correlated with the processed stages of cervical cancer and revealed a novel role of mir- <dig> in cervical cancer progression, which involves regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis.

pro-survival and -growth functions of mir- <dig> with distinct mechanisms have been demonstrated in breast, gastric and lung cancer cells  <cit> . huang et al. has shown that mir- <dig> overexpression promotes human breast cancer cell growth, clonogenicity, and reduces apoptosis by targeting the pro-apoptotic purinerigic p2x <dig> receptor and that reduction of mir- <dig> suppresses tumor growth in xenograft breast tumor mice  <cit> . ectopic expression of mir- <dig> increases the growth of gastric cancer cells and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo  <cit> . inhibition of mir- <dig> in lung cancer cells effectively suppresses cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis  <cit> . here, mir- <dig> overexpression in cervical cancer cells promotes cell growth and survival, while mir- <dig> inhibition delays cell proliferation and induces more apoptosis. moreover, mir- <dig> reduces the mrna and protein expression of two pro-apoptotic genes bim and fasl, suggesting that mir- <dig> promote cell survival through downregulating these genes. furthermore, mir- <dig> enhances the cell cycle progression from the g1/g <dig> to s phase which is related to the decrease of p <dig> and the increase of cyclind <dig> 

it has been identified that mir- <dig> targets the 3′utr of multiple genes which play important roles in cell proliferation, clonogenicity, invasion, intercellular adhesion, and apoptosis. in gastric cancer cells, mir- <dig> promotes cell survival by repressing the transcription of egr <dig>  a pro-apoptotic gene  <cit> . mir- <dig> also targets the 3′utr of p <dig> and thus regulates its expression, leading to cell survival  <cit> . 3′utr of pro-apoptotic purinergic p2x <dig> is targeted by mir- <dig> in breast cancer cells  <cit> . our work identified foxo <dig> as a novel target of mir- <dig> as mir- <dig> suppressed the transcriptional process of foxo <dig> through targeting the 3′utr of its mrna. foxo <dig>  a member of the class o of forkhead box transcription factors , is an important downstream target of the insulin-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase –serine–threonine kinase akt/protein kinase b  signaling pathway which can protect cells against apoptosis  <cit> . enforced foxo <dig> activity induces apoptosis through regulation of various pro-apoptotic genes, such as fasl, bim, bcl- <dig>  and puma, and modulates cell cycle progression through influencing p <dig>  p130rb <dig>  cyclind <dig>  and cycling <dig>  <cit> . since mir- <dig> overexpression modulates the expression of cyclind <dig>  p <dig>  fasl, and bim, it is possible that these regulation is caused by mir-150-mediated foxo <dig> targeting .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results demonstrate the important role of elevated mir- <dig> in cervical cancer progression and reveal that mir- <dig> promotes cervical cancer cell growth and survival by targeting foxo <dig>  moreover, our data also suggest that mir- <dig> can be used as a potential therapeutic target which may improve the treatment of cervical cancer.
