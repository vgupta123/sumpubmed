BACKGROUND
oncolytic virus therapy is a new modality of cancer treatment, which has shown promising results in clinical trials  <cit> . oncolytic viruses are designed to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells without harming normal tissue. since reporting the successful treatment of a brain tumor model by a tk-mutant herpes simplex virus  vector in  <dig>  <cit> , we have focused on the development of increasingly efficacious and safe, replication-competent oncolytic hsv vectors. for the generation of new oncolytic vectors, insertion of exogenous genes or promoter sequences is often performed to enhance anti-tumor activity or tumor-selectivity of the vector. an example of the former is insertion of an interleukin gene and of the latter, insertion of a tumor- or tissue-specific promoter  <cit> . traditionally, recombinant hsv vectors have been generated through homologous recombination by co-transfecting mammalian cells with purified hsv dna and a plasmid containing exogenous sequences flanked by viral sequences homologous to the insertion site. this method usually requires laborious screening or selection and can take several months. recent advances in bacterial artificial chromosome  technology have enabled cloning of the whole hsv genome as a bac plasmid and subsequent manipulation in e. coli  <cit> . thus, we sought a method to generate recombinant oncolytic hsv vectors more easily and quickly using bac technology.

it is not practical to manipulate bac-cloned hsv dna using conventional subcloning methods such as restriction enzyme digestion and ligation, because hsv-bac dna is usually more than  <dig> kilobases  in length. to circumvent this problem and achieve efficient and accurate manipulation in e. coli, site-specific recombination , homologous recombination/allelic exchange , and transposon integration have been used for mutagenesis or the introduction of foreign sequences into bac-cloned virus genomes  <cit> . another factor to consider in bac-mediated recombinant hsv construction is the packaging capacity of the hsv virion. it has been reported that packaging of dna fragments larger than  <dig> kb into hsv virions is not efficient  <cit> . bac cloning requires insertion of mini f plasmid sequences and antibiotic resistance genes into the viral genome and the length of these bac backbone sequences is usually greater than  <dig> kb in total  <cit> . insertion of bac sequences into the wild-type hsv genome  will increase the genome length to ~ <dig> kb, and there will be no space left for the insertion of additional sequences. to avoid deleterious effects of the bac sequences, including growth defects and potential transmission between bacteria and man, some herpesvirus bac clones have been constructed with loxp site-flanked bac sequences, which can be removed by cre recombinase  <cit> . in this study, we chose to use two independent site-specific recombination systems, cre/loxp and flp/frt, sequentially in two separate steps. these two steps are:  integration of the shuttle vector containing a foreign sequence into the hsv-bac genome and  excision of the bac sequences from the integrated hsv-bac-shuttle dna. we also employed another strategy for efficient generation of correctly recombined hsv vectors. the size of the integrated hsv-bac-shuttle dna was designed to exceed the packaging capacity of the hsv virion by inserting a stuffer sequence, so that recombinant hsv genomes are efficiently packaged and propagated only after removal of the bac and stuffer sequences by flpe. this strategy enabled us to obtain nearly pure  preparations of correctly recombined virus lacking the bac sequences by simply co-transfecting mammalian cells with the integrated hsv-bac-shuttle vector and an flpe expression plasmid. we termed this system the flip-flop  hsv-bac system.

in this paper, we describe the flip-flop hsv-bac system and its use for the generation of recombinant hsv vectors with the essential icp <dig> gene driven by the cmvie promoter. icp <dig>  is the product of the immediate-early α <dig> or ie- <dig> gene, and functions as the main transcriptional activator of viral genes  <cit> . previously, we reported the generation of transcriptionally-targeted oncolytic hsv vectors using an icp4-deletion mutant hsv d <dig> as a backbone  <cit> . we introduced an albumin-promoter-driven icp <dig> expression cassette into the tk gene locus of d <dig> and showed that the resultant virus g92a selectively replicated in and killed hepatoma cells and tumor xenografts in which the albumin promoter was active  <cit> . using the same strategy, another group generated an oncolytic hsv vector targeting soft tissue and bone tumors with an icp <dig> cassette driven by human calponin promoter  <cit> . for the present study, we cloned d <dig> as a bac plasmid, with the bac sequences integrated in the ul <dig>  gene, and then inserted icp <dig> expression cassettes into d120-bac using the flip-flop hsv-bac system. icp <dig> is the large subunit of viral ribonucleotide reductase and disruption of this gene limits hsv growth to actively dividing cells  <cit> . we showed that insertion of an icp <dig> expression cassette driven by the cmvie promoter efficiently drove viral replication, whereas insertion of the icp <dig> coding sequence  alone did not restore viral replication. use of a tumor-specific promoter instead of the cmvie promoter, should generate a transcriptionally-targeted oncolytic hsv vector. furthermore, these studies illustrate the power of the flip-flop hsv-bac system to rapidly generate hsv recombinants.

RESULTS
outline of the flip-flop hsv-bac system
the flip-flop hsv-bac system for the generation of exogenous promoter driven hsv vectors is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the two starting plasmids for this system are the prototype hsv-bac clone, pm24-bac, and the promoterless shuttle vector pfls-icp <dig>  both of which carry one loxp and one frt recombination site. pm24-bac contains the genome of d <dig> virus with the hsv icp <dig> gene  disrupted by insertion of the bac cassette . the shuttle plasmid pfls-icp <dig> contains the icp <dig> cds with a multiple cloning site  upstream so exogenous promoters can be inserted to drive icp <dig> expression, the r6kγ origin of replication, kanamycin resistance gene, lacz marker gene, and a stuffer sequence derived from bacteriophage lambda . promoters of interest  are inserted into the mcs by conventional subcloning methods to create a shuttle plasmid containing an icp <dig> expression cassette driven by that promoter  .

in the first step, the shuttle vector pfls-pr is integrated into pm24-bac by cre recombinase in vitro and an integrated bac clone  isolated in e. coli by selection with kanamycin and chloramphenicol. as replication from the r6kγ origin is dependent on the π protein encoded by the pir gene and the bac host e. coli strain is pir-, the r6kγ origin in the integrated bac does not interfere with bac replication  <cit> . in the second step, the integrated pm24-bac-shuttle dna and the flpe expression plasmid are co-transfected to icp4-complementing e <dig> cells and the bac backbone and stuffer sequences, flanked by frt sites derived from pm24-bac and the shuttle vector, are excised by flpe recombinase . any hsv genome retaining the bac sequences  is oversized and cannot be packaged efficiently.

cloning of the prototype hsv-bac clone pm24-bac
to initiate hsv-bac cloning, a recombinant hsv mutant containing bac sequences was generated by homologous recombination. the bac cassette was inserted into the icp <dig>  locus of icp4-deletion mutant d <dig> . resultant icp4/icp <dig> double-deletion mutant hsv  formed egfp-positive plaques, somewhat smaller than those of parental d <dig>  presumably due to the additional icp <dig> deletion . the genomic structure of m24-bac was confirmed by hindiii restriction analysis .

an hsv-bac plasmid containing the whole genome of m24-bac, pm24-bac, was isolated by transforming dh10b e. coli with circular viral dna and its genomic structure confirmed by hindiii restriction analysis . pm24-bac dna was infectious, generating virus, bm24-bac  after transfection of e <dig> cells. two independent plaque-purified bm24-bac isolates and parental m24-bac had similar properties:  they formed comparably sized egfp-positive plaques;  they had identically sized restriction endonuclease fragments ; and  they had identical virus growth kinetics and similar virus yields . therefore, we concluded that the reconstituted bm24-bac virus retains the same characteristics as the original m24-bac virus and that the hsv-bac plasmid pm24-bac contains a faithful copy of the m24-bac virus genome.

shuttle vector integration into pm24-bac by cre recombinase
as a proof-of-principle and to validate the flip-flop hsv-bac system, we constructed three recombinant viruses :  bm24-cmv, with the icp <dig> cds driven by the human cmvie promoter,  bm24-null, with the icp <dig> cds lacking a promoter, and  bm24-empty, with no icp <dig> cds, which was generated with shuttle vector pfls <dig> lacking the icp <dig> cds. first, the specificity and efficiency of cre recombinase mediated integration into pm24-bac  was examined. in the pm24-bac-cmv cloning, three bac clones  contained a single integrated copy of pfls-cmv, whereas six other clones  had an additional  <dig>  kb band , indicating integration of multiple copies of the shuttle vector . the remaining one clone  had not undergone recombination and showed a pattern identical to that of pm24-bac. we used the single insert clones for bm24-cmv virus generation. in the pm24-bac-null cloning, six out of  <dig> bac clones contained the complete hsv-bac genome based on hindiii restriction analysis, all of which carried a single integrated copy of the shuttle vector, whereas the remaining seven clones contained a partially deleted, incomplete hsv-bac genome . these deletions seemed to have occurred randomly at different locations, presumably due to shearing during dna manipulation . in the pm24-bac-empty cloning, nine out of ten clones contained the complete hsv-bac genome, all of which carried multiply integrated pfls <dig> shuttle vector . even with multiple copies of the shuttle vector integrated into the loxp site of pm24-bac, flpe recombination between the most distal pair of frt sites during virus generation should remove any extra copies of the shuttle vector along with the bac backbone sequences . thus, these multiple insert clones were used to create bm24-empty virus.

recombinant virus generation by flpe recombinase excision of bac sequences
next, we compared the efficiency of recombinant virus generation following transfection of pm24-bac-shuttle dna with or without the flpe plasmid to determine whether the increased size was sufficient to inhibit packaging of bac-containing viral genomes. e <dig> cells were transfected with:  the prototype hsv-bac, pm24-bac  alone,  pm24-bac-null alone , or  pm24-bac-null and the flpe expression vector . progeny viruses were harvested  <dig> days after transfection and titered on e <dig> cells. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  expression of lacz indicates the precise integration of the shuttle vector into pm24-bac and the lack of egfp expression, the loss of the bac vector sequences. when pm24-bac alone was transfected, the virus yield was  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu and all harvested viruses formed egfp-positive and lacz-negative plaques . on the other hand, the titer after pm24-bac-null transfection  was two logs lower . furthermore, the virus formed much smaller plaques than pm24-bac derived virus and almost all of the plaques were both egfp- and lacz-positive, as would be expected. when pm24-bac-null was co-transfected with the flpe expression plasmid, most of the harvested viruses formed egfp-negative/lacz-positive plaques and their sizes were comparable to those of the viruses derived from pm24-bac . there was a very low proportion of egfp/lacz double-positive plaques , similar in size those formed by bm24-bac-null. thus, more than 99% of the harvested viruses were egfp-negative/lacz-positive. similar results were obtained in the generation of bm24-cmv and bm24-empty viruses. in order to confirm the impaired growth of the oversized virus carrying the bac and stuffer sequences, we performed single-step growth assay using the crude virus preparations harvested in fig 5b. while the virus burst sizes of bm24-bac and bm24-null were similar, that of bm24-bac-null was 5-7-fold less . two independently generated isolates  of the egfp-negative/lacz-positive virus were plaque-purified and their genomic structure confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis .

the recombinant viruses replicate efficiently only when icp <dig> is expressed
in order for pm24-bac to be a suitable backbone vector for the generation of transcriptionally-targeted hsv vectors, viruses generated from it should not replicate in non-complementing cells in the absence of an active upstream promoter. this was tested in vero cells, which are the parental cell line for the icp4-complementing e <dig> cells, by comparing the growth of bm24-cmv to bm24-null and bm24-empty. the expression of icp <dig> was detected in cells infected with bm24-cmv as early as  <dig> hours post-infection and increased up to  <dig> hours at least, but not in cells infected with bm24-null or bm24-empty . this is similar kinetics to that seen after kos  or hrr <dig>  infection, but at much lower levels . bm24-cmv formed plaques efficiently on vero cells, similar to hrr <dig>  while only a few small plaques were formed after infection with over 30-fold more bm24-null and no plaques with bm24-empty . in a virus burst assay, bm24-cmv yielded ~5– <dig> pfu/cell, while bm24-null and bm24-empty yielded  <dig>  and  <dig>  pfu/cell, respectively . the replication of bm24-cmv was delayed compared to hrr <dig> or kos , probably reflecting the limited expression of icp <dig>  however, this level of icp <dig> expression is sufficient to drive viral replication. interestingly, there was over a 100-fold difference in bm24-cmv virus yield in different human tumor cell lines, with hepg <dig> the most susceptible and sw <dig> the least, whereas hrr <dig> replication was similar in all  <dig> tumor cell lines and bm24-null did not appreciably replicate in any of the cells .

discussion
transcriptionally-targeted oncolytic virus vectors are promising cancer therapeutic agents and some of them have already been applied to cancer patients in clinical trials. for example, an oncolytic adenovirus vector cv <dig> whose replication is driven by the prostate-specific antigen  promoter/enhancer element has completed phase i clinical trials and some of the patients showed a significant decrease in serum psa levels  <cit> . although there are many potentially promising tumor-specific promoters reported in the literature and many of them have been used for generation of oncolytic adenoviruses  <cit> , only a few have been tested in the context of transcriptionally-targeted hsv vectors due to the extensive labor involved in constructing recombinant hsv vectors  <cit> .

traditionally, recombinant hsv vectors have been generated via homologous recombination between purified hsv dna and recombination plasmid in co-transfected cells. in addition to the inefficiency of recombination, there is the need to screen or select plaques for the correct recombinant. this has hampered the development of new recombinant hsv vectors. recent advances in bac technology have enabled the cloning of herpesvirus genomes as bacs and their manipulation in e. coli  <cit> . using our flip-flop hsv-bac system, once a shuttle vector containing a promoter of interest is constructed, nearly pure  preparations of recombinant vector can be obtained typically within two weeks, which can be easily plaque-purified subsequently. it should be noted that this system can also be applied to the generation of transgene-expressing hsv vectors if replication-competent hsv-bac is used as a prototype bac  <cit> . a similar strategy for the generation of oncolytic hsv vectors, termed the hsvquik system, has recently been reported  <cit> .

in step <dig> of the flip-flop hsv-bac system, cre-mediated recombination was performed biochemically and then integrated bac dna electroporated into e. coli. as high-molecular-weight bac dna is vulnerable to mechanical shearing, these procedures could cause double-strand breaks, lowering the proportion of correctly integrated hsv-bacs. when we generated pm24-bac-null clones, more than half of the clones  had suffered large deletions occurring at random locations , while for pm24-bac-cmv and pm24-bac-null cloning, 90%  of the bac clones contained a full-length hsv-bac genome, with either single or multiple shuttle inserts . to date, we have generated several different transcriptionally-targeted hsv vectors using this system and found that the efficiency of full-length hsv-bac cloning after cre recombination varied between  <dig> to 100%  . an alternate way to avoid bac dna shearing in step <dig> would be to perform site-specific recombination in bacteria by introducing the shuttle and cre-expressing plasmids into the e. coli carrying the prototype hsv-bac plasmid, as reported previously  <cit> . terada et al. employed, in their hsvquik system, a similar strategy using an flp-expressing plasmid for the integration of their hsv-bac and transfer plasmids, and reported that ~80% of hsv-bac clones contained correct co-integrants  <cit> .

the efficiency of flpe-mediated excision of the bac and stuffer sequences from the integrated hsv-bac-shuttle dna was high, with over 99% of recombinant virus harvested after step <dig> lacz-positive and egfp-negative. in order for recombined virus to be generated, several events need to occur:  both the integrated hsv-bac-shuttle and the flpe plasmid is transfected into a same cell,  flpe is expressed,  the bac sequences are excised from the hsv-bac dna,  the recombined viral genome is replicated and  packaged. there are multiple factors affecting these processes, including the rate and level of flpe expression and the timing of recombination. in fact, we do not know at which stage the flpe recombination occurs, i.e. in the original hsv-bac dna or in the replicated virus dna concatemer. in the former case, all the replicated viral dna are correct recombinants and readily packaged, whereas in the latter case, only a fraction of the viral dna concatemer may be packaged. therefore, the efficiency of viral production through all these events could be lower than that after transfection of pm24-bac alone, from which bm24-bac virus can be generated directly without recombination. in our experiment, the yield of flpe-recombined virus was sufficient, albeit a log lower than that of bm24-bac . for the generation of bm24-empty virus, we used pm24-bac-empty clones that contained multiple integrated copies of shuttle vector. even in these multiple inserts, flpe recombination between the most distal pair of frt sites results in the generation of correct recombinant virus, while recombination between other pairs of frt sites generates viral genomes, which are still oversized and cannot be efficiently packaged. thus, multiple-insert bac clones can be used for recombinant virus generation.

when pm24-bac-null was co-transfected with the flpe plasmid to excise the bac sequences, the ratio of bm24-null to bm24-bac-null was over  <dig> . there are two factors affecting the final yield ratio between the recombined and non-recombined virus:  efficiency of recombination, and  difference in growth kinetics between the two viruses. previously, smith and enquist, reported that co-transfection of loxp-carrying prv-bac dna and a cre expression plasmid resulted in a virus preparation containing 10–15% non-recombined viruses  <cit> . in order to improve the yield of correctly recombined virus, they inserted a cre expression cassette into the loxp-flanked bac cassette so that cre was expressed from non-recombined bac-virus. this self-excision strategy worked very well and the yield of correctly recombined virus was more than  <dig> %. in the flip-flop hsv-bac system, we took a different approach to maximize the yield of correct recombinant virus; a stuffer sequence was included in the shuttle vector so that the integrated hsv-bac clones are oversized and produce virus efficiently only after the bac and stuffer sequences are removed. using this strategy, ~ <dig> % of harvested viruses were correct recombinants . as shown in fig 5c, the growth of oversized bm24-bac-null virus  was much reduced compared to that of recombined virus bm24-null. as hsv-bac can accommodate larger dna, an integrated hsv-bac with a much larger genome size  using a longer stuffer sequence, should further reduce the production of non-recombined virus.

we previously reported the generation of albumin-promoter-driven hsv vector g92a in which the icp <dig> expression cassette was inserted into the thymidine kinase  gene  <cit> . unfortunately, tk-mutant viruses are resistant to acyclovir treatment, which is not desirable for clinical application  <cit> . to avoid this problem, we chose to insert the bac vector sequences and icp <dig> expression cassette into the ul <dig> gene, preserving the tk gene. ul <dig> encodes icp <dig>  the large subunit of the viral ribonucleotide reductase, and its inactivation limits vector replication to actively dividing cells  <cit> . additionally, icp <dig> inactivation increases virus sensitivity to acyclovir  <cit> . it is worth noting that the initial hsv-bac construct can be generated by insertion of the bac cassette into any desired sequence or gene in the viral genome, other than icp <dig> 

in the current study, it was important to first demonstrate that there were not cryptic regulatory sequences that would drive icp <dig> expression in the absence of promoters when inserted into the icp <dig> region of hsv. bm24-null is such a construct and was highly defective in replication, only minimally better than bm24-empty, lacking any icp <dig> sequences. these results show that pm24-bac is suitable as a prototype construct for the generation of transcriptionally-targeted hsv vectors. in a plaquing assay, bm24-null formed a few plaques on vero cells when infected at  <dig> pfu/well, while no plaques were formed by the same amount of bm24-empty . these plaques might have arisen from bm24-null mutants with genome rearrangements or deletions that activated icp <dig> expression.

when icp <dig> was expressed under the control of the cmvie promoter, its level of expression was much lower than kos and hrr <dig>  which have diploid copies of wild-type icp <dig> gene . recently, terada et al. reported that hsv promoters, icp <dig>  ie <dig> and ie4/ <dig>  induced a higher level of luciferase expression compared to the cmvie promoter when inserted in the icp <dig> gene  <cit> , the same location as in bm24-cmv. regulation of hsv transcription and translation is complex, with icp <dig> playing a major role, both as a trans-activator and repressor  <cit> . upon infection, the tegument protein vp <dig> activates hsv immediate-early gene expression, however it does not similarly activate the cmvie promoter  <cit> , which could account for the delayed kinetics. in a study of cmvie promoter-gfp expression in hsv immediate-early gene mutants, it was found that cmvie promoter activity was dependent upon icp <dig> expression levels  <cit>  and that the cmvie promoter in the hsv genome was actively repressed in the absence of viral activators  <cit> .

it is not clear what levels of icp <dig> expression are necessary for viral replication. in a single-step growth assay , bm24-cmv grew efficiently in vero cells, with slower kinetics than hrr <dig> or kos, presumably reflecting the lower and slower induction of icp <dig> by the cmvie promoter. furthermore, the levels of bm24-cmv replication, as opposed to hrr <dig>  varied considerably in different tumor cell lines. this could be due to variable activity of the cmvie promoter or different levels of icp <dig> required for replication in different cell lines. in fact, we found that the transcriptional activity of the cmvie promoter in sw <dig> was  <dig> to  <dig> fold lower than in hepg <dig> or a <dig>  using a transient luciferase reporter assay  <cit> . while considered constitutive, cmvie promoter activity has been shown to vary greatly in different cells; in transgenic mice, or with transiently transfected plasmids or adenovirus vectors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the flip-flop hsv-bac system we describe enables rapid generation of hsv vectors carrying transgene inserts. by introducing a tumor-specific-promoter-driven icp <dig> cassette into pm24-bac using this system, one should be able to generate transcriptionally-targeted oncolytic hsv vectors. we believe this system will greatly facilitate the screening of a plethora of clinically useful tumor-specific promoters in the context of oncolytic hsv vectors.
