BACKGROUND
alu repeats are sines  whose original insertion in genomic sequences appears to have occurred shortly after the dawn of the primate lineage. while most sines arose from trna genes, alu elements are derived from the 7sl rna gene, which encodes a component of the protein signal recognition complex. the structure of modern alu sequences arose from a duplication of primordial elements, which were approximately  <dig> bp in length and composed of an rna polymerase iii promoter at one extremity and a polya tail at the other. dimeric alu elements expanded extensively throughout primate genomes as a result of a parasitic relationship with the transposition machinery encoded by l <dig> retrotransposons, which are lines   <cit> , and today occupy ~10% of the human genome.

several lines of evidence indicate that a variety of events associated with alu transposition, recombination and expansion have contributed to genome evolution and to altering gene expression by several mechanisms. because of their high cpg content and the tendency of cpg dinucleotides to mutate, and because of their prevalence, alu repeats contain a substantial percentage of the single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human genome  <cit> . their polya tails act to seed microsatellite formation and expansion  <cit> . moreover, alu transposition has been proposed to underlie the expansion of segmental duplications that comprise approximately 5% of the human genome  <cit> . conservative estimates suggest that  <dig> – <dig> % of human genetic disorders arise from mobile element insertion or from element-driven recombination events  <cit> . there is also evidence that alu repeats inserted in an antisense orientation to gene transcripts can introduce alternative splicing sites  <cit> , and that insertion of alu sequences may alter epigenetic regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

in addition to the above, increasing evidence suggests that alu repeats are a source of elements that regulate transcriptional initiation by rna polymerase ii  <cit> .

we have been interested in genome-wide mapping of hormone response elements in the promoter-proximal regions of human genes  <cit>  to study their evolutionary conservation in the vicinity of genes, and their accessibility to cognate members of the nuclear receptor family. nuclear receptors are the primary targets of a range of lipophilic signaling molecules such as steroid and thyroid hormones, vitamin d, retinoids, specific prostaglandins and cholesterol metabolites that regulate many aspects of physiology and metabolism, as well as embryonic development  <cit> . they directly regulate gene transcription by ligand-dependent recruitment of so-called coregulatory proteins that carry out the histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and binding of rna polymerase ii and ancillary factors necessary for initiation of transcription  <cit> .

nuclear receptors are composed of a series of domains, with the dna binding and ligand binding domains being the most highly conserved. most nuclear receptors function as homo- or heterodimers, and many receptor dna binding domains recognize variants of consensus rgktca motifs arranged as either direct or inverted repeats <cit> . many non-steroid receptors recognize direct repeats in the form of heterodimers with members of the retinoid × receptor  family. for example, retinoic acid receptors  heterodimerized with rxrs specifically recognize retinoic acid response elements  as rgktca direct repeats separated by  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> bp , whereas heterodimerized receptors for vitamin d  and thyroid hormone  recognize dr <dig> and dr <dig> elements, respectively.

evidence is accumulating that alu repeats constitute a significant source of hormone response elements  <cit> . notably, a motif, aggtcannagttcg, found within most subclasses of alus sequences, corresponds to a non-consensus dr <dig> element recognized by rars, and has been shown to function as a rare  <cit> . signaling through rars is of particular interest because retinoids control many aspects of embryonic development in a wide variety of organisms  <cit> .

here, we used a genome-wide screen to map dr-type hormone response elements in the human genome, and found that consensus dr <dig> elements are massively overrepresented relative to dr <dig> and dr <dig> rares and drs recognized by other nuclear receptors, due to the presence of consensus dr <dig> motifs in > <dig>  alu repeats. the vast majority of these correspond to alus sequences, which drove the alu element expansion in primate that started 35– <dig> myr ago. we also show that these "alu-dr2" elements are present in retinoic acid regulated genes and bind rars in vivo. taken together, our data provide strong support for the notion that alu-mediated expansion of dr elements contributed to the evolution of gene regulation by rars and other nuclear receptors in primates and humans.

RESULTS
mapping dr-type hormone response elements in the human and mouse genomes
a number of nuclear receptors recognize direct repeats of rgktca motifs spaced between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides as response elements, and individual receptors distinguish between dr elements based on inter-repeat spacings and subtle differences in motif sequence  <cit> . sequencing of entire genomes has opened the way to mapping dna response elements for nuclear hormone receptors on a genome-wide scale  <cit> . given that mice have been used extensively as genetic models to study nuclear receptor signaling , we compared the frequency and distribution of consensus direct repeat response elements  both in the mouse and human genomes . although the frequency of these motifs should be comparable in random dna sequences, our screen revealed that dr <dig> elements are about 10-fold more frequent than other dr sequences in the human genome, and are about 4-fold more common than in the mouse genome . in addition, dr <dig> and dr <dig> elements occur more frequently than dr <dig> or dr <dig> elements . to investigate the varying frequencies of different dr elements in the human and mouse genomes, we examined the proportions of each of these motifs found in transposable elements . the vast majority of human dr <dig> motifs map within sines, in particular in alu repeats , while approximately 50% of dr <dig> elements in the mouse  are found in retroviral ltrs, which only account for  <dig> of the human elements . dr <dig> motifs were also significantly associated within sines in the human genome, whereas dr <dig> motifs in tes are found mostly in lines . the frequencies of dr elements outside tes is relatively similar, indicating that incorporation of dr elements within sines, lines or ltrs is the main cause for their variable distributions.

over  <dig>  consensus dr elements are present in alu repeats
to assess whether the large over-representation of dr2s in sines reflects amplification of a specific sequence, we calculated the frequencies of all motifs corresponding to the dr <dig> consensus. of the  <dig>  consensus dr <dig> elements located in alu repeats,  <dig>  corresponded to the sequence aggtcannagttca, and of these, aggtcaggagttca accounted for  <dig>  occurrences, along with  <dig>  copies with only one variation in the spacer nucleotides . other consensus dr <dig> elements containing one variation in the repeated motifs were much less frequent . consensus dr <dig> or dr <dig> motifs resulting from removal or addition of one nucleotide from the highly represented dr <dig> sequence were even more infrequent in alu repeats .

the  <dig>  dr <dig> elements, which are rar target sequences, are by far the most frequent consensus dr motif present in alu repeats , followed by dr <dig> elements, recognized specifically by trs . it is noteworthy that the  <dig> alu-dr <dig> elements represent ~50% of the total consensus dr <dig> elements in the genome . moreover, unlike in the dr <dig> consensus, rggtca motifs are found predominantly in the 3' repeat of the alu dr <dig> sequences . this position is bound by the tr when rxr-tr heterodimers bind to dr <dig> motifs. since the tr has weak affinity for rgttca but recognizes rggtca motifs  <cit> , these dr <dig> elements represent optimal tr binding sites.

the vast majority of alu-dr elements are present in alus sequences
further analysis of human dr2-alu elements revealed that their 5' ends are tightly clustered around positions 66– <dig> of the alu repeat . dr <dig> and dr <dig> elements showed largely similar distributions. in contrast, the 5' ends dr <dig> elements were found predominantly at position  <dig> of the repeat . while dr <dig> elements were somewhat more widely distributed, most motifs started at positions  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  the results reveal that dr <dig> and dr <dig> elements originated from partially overlapping sequences, where the 5' half-site of the consensus dr <dig> element corresponds to the 3' half-site of the dr <dig> motif .

the vast majority of consensus dr <dig> elements  are present in alus sequences, which represent just under 56% of total alu sequences in the human genome. the overrepresentation of dr elements in alus sequences, which largely drove the alu repeat expansion 35– <dig> myr ago  <cit> , indicates that the majority of the consensus alu-dr <dig> sequences  present in the human genome multiplied through primate genomes during this alus expansion. consensus dr <dig> elements are similarly distributed primarily in alus sequences . in contrast, consensus dr <dig> elements are markedly underrepresented in older aluj and younger aluy sequences . of the  <dig> % of dr <dig> motifs  present in potentially mobile aluy elements, only  <dig> motifs were not found to be present in the chimp and rhesus macaque genomes , indicating that more recent aluy-mediated transposition was not a major driving force in shaping retinoid-regulated gene expression in the human genome.

consensus alu-dr <dig> elements arose predominantly via deamination of a methylated cpg dinucleotide
the distribution and frequency of dr <dig> elements in alu sequences can be explained by the fact that the consensus dr <dig> rare differs from the consensus sequence of several alus subfamilies by a single g to a substitution in the 3'-most nucleotide of the dr <dig> repeat, whereas generation of an rare consensus from alu j or y sequences would require multiple substitutions . similarly, a single a to g or t substitution in the third position of the upstream ggatca motif in alus subfamilies sx, sq and sp would generate a consensus dr <dig> element. note however that although two different single mutations can lead to formation of a consensus dr <dig> versus one single replacement leading to a consensus dr <dig>  the rate of conversion to a consensus dr <dig> is far superior to that to a dr <dig> element in all alu subclasses.

it is noteworthy that generation of the dr <dig> rare consensus could occur through deamination of a methylated c residue in the cpg dinucleotide of the alus consensus, converting it to a t on the complementary strand of the direct repeat. a comparison of the frequencies of all four possible cpn dinucleotides in aggtcannagttcn motifs present in alus sequences indicates that cpa occurs far more frequently than cpt or cpc . similarly, the conversion to t of the c residue of the cpg on the sense strand occurred far more frequently than other substitutions . collectively, these data support the notion that the cpa dinucleotide in the dr <dig> element arose predominantly via a deamination-driven mechanism rather than by random base substitutions. the data are also consistent with other observations of high rates of cpg methylation  <cit>  and of cpg dinucleotide decay generally in alu repeats  <cit> . further, the rate of conversion to consensus dr2s was similar in different subclasses of alus elements differing by only one nucleotide , suggesting generation of dr2s via the same methylation/deamination mechanism throughout evolution of the family. in addition, it is worth noting that the conversion to a perfect dr <dig> from the consensus alus sequence, while introducing a change in the sequence of the box b of the rna poliii promoter, occurs without altering its consensus , suggesting that alu elements containing perfect dr <dig> may still be mobile  <cit> . in a recent paper price et al. defined over  <dig> alus subfamilies  <cit> , seven of which contain consensus dr <dig> elements. one of these, alusg_ <dig> shares the presence of the consensus rare dr <dig> with three subfamilies . these alus subfamilies are likely examples of dr <dig> elements amplified by transposition instead of spontaneous mutation of a cpg.

distribution of alu-dr <dig> elements relative to the 5'ends of human genes
generation of consensus dr <dig> in alu elements via a mechanism implicating methylation of cpg dinucleotides, which is associated with transcriptional silencing, raises the question of whether these motifs can be recognized by rars as functional binding sites. to investigate whether these elements could contribute to gene regulation, we first characterized the distribution of repeats containing dr <dig> elements relative to the 5' ends of human genes . the distribution of alu-dr <dig> differed from that of alu repeats , with a sharper reduction in the number of elements between - <dig> and + <dig> kb of transcriptional start sites. we note that there was a 20–30% further relative reduction in elements containing dr <dig> motifs within  <dig> kb of known 5' ends of genes compared to the general distribution of alu elements, suggestive of a selection pressure against the presence of promoter-proximal alu-dr <dig> sequences. however, rares are known to function as enhancer elements at distances up to 10– <dig> kb. our mapping studies revealed over  <dig>  alu-dr <dig> elements lying within - <dig> kb and + <dig> kb of the 5'ends of > <dig>  genes, , representing a substantial proportion of human genes.

association of rars with alu-dr <dig> elements in vivo
it is highly likely that most of the genes with proximal alu-dr <dig> elements are not implicated in rar-dependent gene regulation in a given cell type, with access to the sites being potentially limited by chromatin structure or binding of other proteins. for example, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies followed by microarray analysis  of genes regulated by related estrogen receptors in estrogen-sensitive breast carcinoma cells have suggested that only a minority of potential high affinity estrogen response elements of a given chromosome are accessible to receptors  <cit> . moreover, as mentioned above, alu repeat sequences are highly susceptible to methylation  <cit> , which correlates with a closed chromatin structure and transcriptional silencing. however,  <dig> alu-dr <dig> were found near  <dig> known retinoic acid target genes , suggesting that some alu-dr <dig> elements can drive retinoid-regulated gene expression. we therefore tested the accessibility of several of these alu-dr <dig> sequences to rars by chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay. we chose multiple elements present in the vicinity of  <dig> genes known to be ra-responsive in cells of squamous epithelial origin, rai <dig>  gprc5a , smyd <dig> , rarres <dig> and rarres <dig>  and assessed rar binding to these elements in scc <dig> cells, a relatively well-differentiated human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  line  <cit> . scc <dig> cells express rars and are retinoid-responsive  <cit> , and are arrested by ra in the g0/g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . the genes rai <dig> and gprc5a were originally identified as ra-regulated genes in hnscc  <cit> . similarly, smyd <dig> and rarres  <dig> and  <dig>  were found to be induced by ra in human keratinocytes  <cit> . rarres <dig> expression is lost in many tumors, and its product inhibits cell proliferation when transiently overexpressed  <cit> .

chip analysis with an anti-panrar antibody revealed rar binding to all elements tested , whereas no rar binding was observed to control sequences lacking dr <dig> elements . in most instances, binding was either not ra-dependent or weakly enhanced by ligand, consistent with capacity of rars to bind dna in the absence of ligand  <cit> . however, immunoprecipitation of rars associated with elements # <dig> in gprc5a and # <dig> in smyd <dig> was consistently ligand-dependent . these studies are important as they confirm that all of the alu-dr <dig> elements tested are in a chromatin environment that renders them accessible to rars in vivo. we also confirmed that an oligonucleotide corresponding to the predominant dr <dig> element present in alu repeats drove robust ra-inducible gene expression when cloned upstream of a truncated thymidine kinase promoter , supporting its potential to function as an rare in vivo.

in addition, we obtained further evidence for the function of alu-dr <dig> elements as ra-dependent enhancer sequences from the publicly-available results of the encode project consortium, which mapped transcription factor binding sites including those for rars in  <dig> selected regions of the human genome   <cit> . chip-on-chip studies of these regions using retinoic acid-treated human hl <dig> cells identified binding regions for rarα,  <dig> of which encompass alu elements containing perfect dr <dig> motifs . of these, we note that expression of caveolin- <dig>  the product of the cav <dig> gene, was found to be upregulated in retinoic acid-treated hl <dig> cells  <cit> . taken together, the data of fig.  <dig> and table  <dig> strongly support the capacity of alu-dr <dig> sequences to function as rares.

discussion
nuclear receptor signaling, particularly that of retinoic acid receptors, has been widely studied in animal models, most notably the mouse. our findings reveal striking differences in hormone response element frequency and distribution between rodent, and primate and human genomes. results of the genome-wide mapping of high affinity hormone response elements for members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors presented herein indicate that consensus dr <dig> retinoic acid response elements are vastly overrepresented relative to other dr response elements in the human genome, and are enriched approximately 4-fold in the human genome relative to the mouse. this enrichment arose as a result of the presence of dr <dig> motifs in alu repeats, which are primate-specific. movement of alu repeats and other classes of transposable elements has been recognized as a potential mechanism for introduction of rna polymerase ii transcriptional regulatory elements for a variety of transcription factors into promoter regions of genes  <cit> , thus altering the signal transduction pathways regulating specific genes. for example, a recent study  <cit>  used dna-binding profiles of representatives of different classes of transcription factors from the transfac database  <cit>  to identify transcription factor binding sites in transposable elements located in promoter regions. this study did not screen for rares, for which matrices are not provided in the transfac database.

while the presence of imperfect rares in alu elements and their capacity to function as rares in reporter assays has been reported previously  <cit> , the main findings from our study are the unexpected large number of consensus dr <dig> rares, and the demonstration that several of these sites are functional rar binding sites in vivo. it is striking that the genome-wide number of imperfect dr2s corresponding to the aggtcannagttcg consensus, which matches the consensus sequences of most alus subclasses, is not much higher  than that of the consensus dr2s , underlining the unexpectedly high number of perfect dr <dig> rares in the human genome . the generation of consensus dr <dig> elements by deamination of the cpg dinucleotide within the 3' agttcg motif is supported by the comparably high number of aggtcannagtttg sequences , which diverge from a perfect dr <dig> more than the motif found in consensus alus sequences but represent the other possible site generated by methylation/deamination at the cpg dinucleotide in the b box of alu repeats.

demonstration that alu dr <dig> rares are functional binding sites in their normal chromatin context is crucial given the high frequency of methylation of alu sequences in the human genome  <cit> , and the association between dna methylation and silencing of transcription in general, and of alu repeats specifically  <cit> . for instance, expression and retinoic acid responsiveness of one of the genes studied above, rarres <dig>  is frequently inhibited in malignancies by hypermethylation  <cit> , and the extent of methylation is inversely correlated with the state of differentiation of malignant cells  <cit> .

the capacity of alu-dr <dig> motifs to function as rares is supported by several lines of evidence. we identified  <dig> motifs within  <dig> kb of the 5' ends of  <dig> known retinoic acid-regulated genes . it is also noteworthy that  <dig> alu-dr <dig> within  <dig> kb of  <dig> genes overlap with dnase i-hypersensitive sites from primary human cd4+ t cells  <cit>  . we confirmed the capacity of several alu-dr <dig> elements to bind rars in vivo in retinoic acid-sensitive scc <dig> cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of receptor binding to sequences located proximal to five genes known to be retinoic acid-responsive in squamous carcinoma cells. these studies indicate that access of rars to the dr <dig> motifs under study was not impeded by their presence in an alu repeats in these cells. moreover, our analyses of chip-on-chip studies from the encode consortium showed that several alu-dr <dig> elements in human hl <dig> cells are sites of ra-dependent recruitment of rars , further supporting the function of alu-dr <dig> elements as rares.

we found that dr <dig> consensus elements were present in substantial numbers in multiple alus subfamilies, indicating that they arose throughout the course of alus expansion. the perfect rare dr <dig> motif corresponds to the consensus sequence in seven divergent alus subfamilies defined by price et al.  <cit> , in addition to being found sporadically throughout numerous other alus subfamily sequences . it should be noted that the downstream half-site of the dr <dig> element lies within box b of the alu rna polymerase iii promoter, but that the conversion of rgttcg to rgttca to generate the consensus dr <dig> motif does not necessarily impair its competence for retrotransposition, consistent with transcriptional activity of alu rna polymerase iii promoters containing rgttcaannc box b motifs  <cit> .

consistent with their presence predominantly in alus sequences, which represent relatively ancient alu elements, we found that the vast majority of human alu-dr <dig> motifs are present in the chimp and macaque genomes. a few alu-dr <dig> elements were apparently unique to the human genome, although in some cases they corresponded to regions that were not sequenced in the simian genomes. while none of these uniquely human alu-dr2s are adjacent to known retinoid-regulated genes in humans, it will be of interest in the future to characterize the potential of ra to regulate their expression in appropriate cell model systems. it is also noteworthy that one of these genes, cyp2a <dig>  was shown to be regulated by the nuclear receptor hepatic nuclear factor  <dig>   <cit> , which, like rars, can recognize dr <dig> motifs  <cit> .

our previous work identified a consensus dr <dig> element recognized by the vdr in vitro and in vivo in the proximal promoter region of the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide gene  <cit> , which was found to be strongly regulated by vitamin d in a variety of human cell types. however, neither the regulation nor the response element was conserved in mouse, and studies by others  <cit>  showed the dr <dig> to be conserved in primates, but not other species, and present in an alu repeat. this represents a clear example of an alu-driven divergence in nuclear receptor gene regulation between primates/humans and other species. results presented here demonstrate that alu repeat expansion similarly has led to the generation of functional binding sites for retinoic acid receptors. further studies of dr2-containing alu repeats will be necessary to determine precisely to which extent these elements have contributed to the primate-specific regulation of target genes by retinoic acid.

CONCLUSIONS
we find that consensus dr <dig> motifs are heavily overrepresented in the human genome relative to other dr response elements due to their presence in a subset of alu motifs, in particular in alus sequences. although dr4s are found far less frequently in alu repeats, those present account for 50% of consensus dr <dig> motifs in the human genome. consensus alu-dr <dig> elements arose predominantly through deamination of a methylated cpg dinucleotide present in alus elements rather than through random base substitutions. while alu elements can be transcriptionally repressed by methylation-driven mechanisms, our screen identified alu-dr <dig> elements in promoter proximal regions of numerous retinoid regulated genes. importantly, we found that alu-dr2s are accessible to rars in vivo in two ra-responsive human cell lines, indicating that the expansion of dr <dig> motifs within alu elements during the course of primate evolution contributed to altering regulation of gene expression by retinoic acid.
