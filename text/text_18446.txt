BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cell cycle progression is under the control of cyclin-dependent kinases . in higher eukaryotic cells, cdc <dig>  cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  and cdk <dig> control cell cycle progression. their activities are regulated through a variety of mechanisms, including association with regulatory subunits , subcellular localization, transcriptional regulation, selective proteolysis, and reversible protein phosphorylation .

binding of a cyclin to a cdk is a crucial step in its activation and leads to its phosphorylation on multiple sites  <cit> . activating phosphorylation within the activation segment  on a conserved threonine residue  is required for cdk activities in vitro and in vivo  <cit>  and is carried out by the cdk-activating kinase , which is composed of cdk <dig>  cyclin h, and mat <dig> in most eukaryotes. inhibitory phosphorylations occur on sites equivalent to thr- <dig> and tyr- <dig> in human cdc <dig> or cdk <dig> and are carried out by wee1-like protein kinases , and removed by members of the cdc <dig> phosphatase family . in addition to activating cdks, cyclins also contribute to their substrate specificities  <cit>  and to their subcellular localizations  <cit> . a general consensus sequence for efficient phosphorylation by cdc <dig> and cdk <dig> is px  <cit> , in which a basic residue at the + <dig> position three amino acids c-terminal to the phosphorylated ser or thr is particularly important.

in addition to their activation by cyclins, cdks can be activated by a novel cell cycle regulator called speedy or ringo , despite the lack of any primary sequence homology between cyclins and speedy/ringo proteins  <cit> . speedy/ringo proteins were initially described in xenopus based on their ability to promote the g <dig> to m transition during oocyte maturation  <cit> . xenopus speedy/ringo bound to and activated cdc <dig> and cdk <dig> in vitro  <cit> . a human speedy/ringo homologue  is essential for s-phase entry in cultured somatic cells in a cdk2-dependent manner: overexpression of human spy <dig> accelerated s-phase entry and cell proliferation, and its inhibition by rnai caused a cell cycle delay at g1/s  <cit> . these biological functions of speedy/ringo proteins were dependent on cdk activity since kinase-inactive forms of cdc <dig> and cdk <dig> abolished the effects of spy <dig> on cell cycle transitions  <cit> . interestingly, unlike cdk-cyclin complexes whose phosphorylation on the activating site is essential for activity, speedy/ringo proteins can activate cdc <dig> and cdk <dig> in vitro in the absence of activating phosphorylation of the cdk  <cit> . thus, xenopus speedy/ringo could activate both wild type cdk <dig> and cdk2t160a equally well and preincubation of cdk <dig> with budding yeast cak  had no effect on its kinase activity toward substrates such as histone h <dig>  <cit> . cdk2-speedy/ringo complexes are also resistant to the inhibitory effects of p21waf1/cip <dig> and wee <dig>  <cit> . paradoxically, although this ability of cdk-speedy/ringo complexes to bypass many forms of regulation imposed on cdk-cyclin complexes might suggest that cdk-speedy/ringo complexes would be highly active, only very low enzymatic activity toward conventional substrates is associated with cdk-speedy/ringo complexes isolated from cells .

the importance of speedy/ringo proteins for cell cycle progression combined with the low protein kinase activity of cdk-speedy/ringo complexes toward conventional substrates raised the possibility that there might be major biochemical differences between cdk-speedy/ringo complexes and cdk-cyclin complexes. these differences might explain how cdk-speedy/ringo complexes recognize their substrates and promote cell cycle progression. major differences are to be expected since the activating phosphorylation that is dispensable for cdk2-speedy/ringo activity plays a key role in substrate recognition by cdk2-cyclin complexes  <cit> . activating phosphorylation also enhances substrate binding by cdk-cyclin complexes  <cit> . the crystal structure of cdk2-cyclin a with an optimal peptide substrate showed that the activating phosphate forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain of the lysine at the + <dig> position of the substrate  <cit> , providing insight into how the activating phosphate participates in substrate recognition. although cdk <dig> can be activated by p35/p <dig>  without activating phosphorylation, a glutamic acid side-chain in p35/p <dig> mimics the activating phosphate and interacts with a basic residue at the + <dig> position of the substrate  <cit> . it will be interesting to know how cdk-speedy/ringo complexes recognize substrates efficiently and how an apparently low level of cdk-speedy/ringo activity can have profound effects on cell cycle progression. a detailed biochemical understanding of cdk-speedy/ringo activity should help us to understand the biological functions of speedy/ringo proteins during cell cycle transitions.

in this study, we explored the biochemical properties of human cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  we found that neither its overall catalytic activity nor its substrate recognition required the activating phosphorylation of cdk <dig>  in fact, cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> was a poor substrate for phosphorylation by metazoan cak. cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> tolerated almost any amino acid residue at the + <dig> position of substrates, which is strikingly different from the rigid requirement of cdk2-cyclin a and cdk2-cyclin e for a basic residue  at the + <dig> position. although cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> phosphorylated canonical cdk2-cyclin a substrates such as histone h <dig> and a ksprk peptide quite poorly, it phosphorylated non-canonical cdk-cyclin substrates, including cdc <dig> protein phosphatases, nearly as well as cdk2-cyclin a. these observations raise the possibility that cdk2-speedy/ringo could phosphorylate and regulate a subset of non-canonical cdk substrates, such as cdc <dig> protein phosphatases.

RESULTS
characterization of purified proteins
we initiated our work by purifying and characterizing the cdk <dig>  cyclin a, and speedy/ringo a <dig> proteins that would be used throughout these studies. unphosphorylated gst-cdk <dig>  was expressed in e. coli and purified via its gst tag. to produce thr160-phosphorylated cdk <dig> , we used a previously described cdk2-cak1p co-expression system  <cit>  that can produce essentially fully phosphorylated cdk <dig>  <cit> . as previously reported  <cit> , cdk <dig> by itself displays a low but detectable histone h <dig> kinase activity . cyclin a stimulated the histone h <dig> kinase activity of cdk <dig>  about 50-fold. the activation of cdk <dig> by cyclin a plateaued when the ratio of cdk <dig> to cyclin a was about 1: <dig>  in contrast to cdk <dig>  the histone h <dig> kinase activity of cdk <dig>  remained very low, even at high cyclin a concentrations, confirming the importance of the activating phosphorylation of cdk <dig> on thr- <dig> .

we next determined the histone h <dig> kinase activities of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> after incubation with gst-speedy/ringo a <dig>  which was expressed and purified from e. coli. we have found that the previously reported mammalian speedy/ringo protein, spy <dig>  is expressed as two closely related proteins resulting from alternative splicing  <cit> . these two proteins, which we term speedy/ringo a <dig> and a <dig>  differ only at their extreme c-termini and appear to be indistinguishable in all functional respects. spy <dig> corresponds to speedy/ringo a <dig>  as shown in fig. 1b, gst-speedy/ringo a <dig> activated cdk <dig>  and cdk <dig>  equally well, indicating that speedy/ringo a <dig> can bind to and activate cdk <dig> without regard to its activating phosphorylation. cdk <dig> activity plateaued at a gst-speedy/ringo a <dig> to gst-cdk <dig> ratio of at least 4: <dig>  we suspect that an excess of gst-speedy/ringo a <dig> over gst-cdk <dig> was required because much of the gst-speedy/ringo a <dig> protein aggregates, as we have observed by gel-filtration chromatography , thereby reducing the effective concentration of active speedy/ringo a <dig> 

as an alternative way to produce functional cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes, we also developed a coexpression system in which a c-terminally hexahistidine-tagged form of speedy/ringo a <dig> was coexpressed with untagged cdk <dig> in e. coli. cdk2-speedy/ringo a2-his <dig>  was purified on a metal affinity column and by gel filtration chromatography. fractions were resolved by 10% sds-page and transferred to a pvdf membrane. total proteins were detected by staining with coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig>  and cdk <dig> was detected by immunoblotting with anti-cdk <dig> antibodies . speedy/ringo a2-his <dig>  which migrated as a  <dig> kda protein on 10% sds-page, co-eluted with cdk <dig> from the gel filtration column. the apparent mw for the peak fractions  was ~ <dig> kda, close to the combined molecular weights of monomeric cdk <dig>  and speedy/ringo a2-his <dig> . the diffuse appearance of speedy/ringo a <dig> is probably due to phosphorylation of speedy/ringo a <dig> by cdk <dig> . the ratio of cdk <dig> to speedy/ringo a2-his <dig> appears to be close to 1: <dig> in fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that one molecule of speedy/ringo a <dig> binds one molecule of cdk <dig>  k2a2coexp displayed very similar protein kinase activity to in vitro-assembled cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes , suggesting that both types of complexes may be fully active. note that because of the coexpression of cdk <dig> and speedy/ringo a <dig>  and the poor phosphorylation of cdk <dig> bound to speedy/ringo a <dig> by both metazoan cak  and budding yeast cak1p , we could only produce the unphosphorylated form of k2a2coexp. this cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> heterodimer was used as a control throughout these studies.

we measured the atpase activities of cdk2-cyclin a and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> to assess the relative fractions of functional complexes. we reasoned that atpase activities would be less subject to substrate specificity effects conferred by cyclin a or speedy/ringo a <dig> than protein kinase assays. the atpase activity of monomeric cdk <dig> is low; both activating phosphorylation and cyclin-binding increase the turnover of atp by 20– <dig> fold  <cit> . therefore, atpase activity should be a reasonable indicator for the adoption of the catalytically active conformation of cdk <dig> in cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes. we determined the atpase activities of cdk2-cyclin a and k2a2coexp. a time course experiment  showed that the rate of atp hydrolysis remained linear during the assay. the relative atpase activities of cdk2-cyclin a and k2a2coexp were calculated from the slopes in fig. 1d and are shown in fig. 1e. the atpase activity of k2a2coexp was slightly higher than that of cdk2-cyclin a, indicating that cdk <dig> in k2a2coexp is as active as that in cdk2-cyclin a. we should emphasize that in vitro-assembled cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and k2a2coexp displayed very similar activities and substrate specificities . thus, it appears that in vitro-assembled cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes are fully active and it is reasonable to assume that they will display physiological biochemical characteristics.

substrate specificity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a2
we used a systematic panel of cdk substrates to investigate the substrate specificity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes. these substrates contained a pentapeptide of the form xspxx  fused to the c-terminus of gst  <cit> . substrates were purified as gst-fusion proteins from e. coli. the optimal substrates for cdc2-cyclin b and cdk2-cyclin a have been identified as px. substitutions of the basic residue at the + <dig> position  had the greatest effects on phosphorylation efficiencies, both by cdc <dig> and by cdk <dig>  <cit> . thus, ksprk is considered the "wild-type" substrate in these studies. we determined which position was most important for phosphorylation by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> using alanine substitution substrates in which the charged residues at - <dig>  + <dig>  and + <dig> were individually replaced with alanine. we compared the abilities of these substrates to be phosphorylated by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> , k2a2coexp, cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  and cdk2-cyclin a . .) for all of these enzymes, replacement of the lysine at the - <dig> position  had no effect on phosphorylation efficiency, substitution at the + <dig> position  had a modest effect, and substitution at the + <dig> position  produced the severest effects . cdk2-cyclin a was much more sensitive to the + <dig> and + <dig> substitutions than any of the forms of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  similar effects were observed using k2a2coexp and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  suggesting that the different ways in which these complexes were produced had little effect on their resulting substrate specificities. phosphorylation of cdk <dig> in cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes had virtually no effect on substrate specificity, which was surprising given the role of this phosphate in recognition of the + <dig> position of substrate by cdk2-cyclin a  <cit> . nevertheless, the + <dig> position was the most important position for both cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  just as it is for cdk2-cyclin a.

we next evaluated the substrate specificity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> at the + <dig> position in more detail using a panel of gst-ksprx substrates  <cit> . we first compared the substrate specificity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> with that of cdk2-cyclin a, allowing us to compare the effects of the binding partner, separate from effects due to the cdk <dig> phosphorylation state. the relative specificities of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and cdk2-cyclin a were determined at a substrate concentration of  <dig> μm, which is well below the km value of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and cdk2-cyclin a  for these substrates, and thus within the linear range of the assay. we also compared the abilities of these kinases to phosphorylate histone h <dig> . the phosphorylation of the "wild-type" substrate  was defined as 100%. although cdk2-cyclin a was less active than fully activated cdk2-cyclin a, cdk2-cyclin a still preferred lysine and arginine residues at the + <dig> position , consistent with a previous report indicating that cdk2-cyclin a was only moderately defective in substrate binding  <cit> . in striking contrast to cdk2-cyclin a, cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> tolerated nearly all amino acid substitutions at the + <dig> position . the best substrates for cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> contained tyrosine  at  <dig> ± 82%, arginine  at  <dig> ± 74%, and tryptophan  at  <dig> ± 56%. more than half of the amino acid substitutions at the + <dig> position produced better substrates than lysine. in fact,  <dig> out of the  <dig> substrates were phosphorylated at least 50% as efficiently as ksprk; only alanine, asparagine, and glutamine yielded poor substrates. in contrast, cdk2-cyclin a was unable to phosphorylate any substitution substrate more than 5% as efficiently as ksprk, and most substitutions produced substrates whose phosphorylation was undetectable .

we next compared the sensitivities of in vitro-assembled cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and k2a2coexp to substitutions at the + <dig> position to test whether the route of formation of these complexes affected their substrate utilization. as shown in fig. 3b, in vitro-assembled cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and k2a2coexp exhibited almost identical phosphorylation efficiency profiles for the tested substrates, including histone h <dig>  except for the ksprk and ksprt substrates, k2a2coexp phosphorylated all substrates slightly less efficiently than in vitro-assembled cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  possibly due to its slightly higher enzymatic activity toward ksprk , which was defined as 100%. overall, the differences in substrate specificity and enzymatic activity between the in vitro-assembled complexes and k2a2coexp were marginal. both complexes could accept any amino acid side chain except aspartate and glutamate at the + <dig> position.

we then determined the effect of thr- <dig> phosphorylation on the substrate specificity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  the optimal substrates at the + <dig> position were arginine  at  <dig> ± 19%, histidine  at  <dig> ± 6%, and lysine  at 100%. phosphorylation of ksprw and kspry were reduced from the very high levels exhibited by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> to levels more typical of other amino acid substitutions. overall, thr- <dig> phosphorylation modulated the substrate specificity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> but did not transform it into a dramatically different pattern .

to determine the absolute  activities of cdk2-cyclin a and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  we compared the abilities of cdk2-cyclin a and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> to phosphorylate several substrates, including histone h <dig>  ksprk, ksprr, and kspry . for cdk2-cyclin a, histone h <dig> and ksprk are the best substrates, although ksprr also fits the consensus substrate sequence, and kspry is an unfavorable substrate  <cit> . cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> phosphorylated all four substrates with similar efficiencies . speedy/ringo a <dig>  cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  and k2a2coexp phosphorylated the optimal cdk2-cyclin a substrates histone h <dig> and ksprk only about  <dig> % as efficiently as cdk2-cyclin a . in fact, the cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes were only about 6-fold more active toward histone h <dig> than monomeric cdk <dig> . the differences between cdk2-cyclin a and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> decreased dramatically when activity was measured toward poorer cdk2-cyclin a substrates. for instance, k2a2coexp phosphorylated ksprr 6% as efficiently as cdk2-cyclin a and it phosphorylated kspry 95% as efficiently as cdk2-cyclin a . thus, the relative activities of cdk <dig> bound to cyclin a or to speedy/ringo a <dig> depend critically on the substrate used.

to understand why cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> was much less active than cdk2-cyclin a toward certain substrates, we tried to assess the km and catalytic activity  of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  we chose several substrates including ksprk, ksprr, kspry, and histone h <dig> for this analysis. phosphorylation of these substrates by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> was carried out over a wide range of substrate concentrations. the maximal concentrations were  <dig> μm for histone h <dig> and  <dig> μm for the gst-peptide substrates. the phosphorylation of histone h <dig>  kspry, and ksprk by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> increased linearly up to the maximum concentration of each substrate . interestingly, the phosphorylation of the ksprr substrate plateaued at high substrate concentrations . we observed a similar phosphorylation efficiency-concentration relationship using k2a2coexp , suggesting that ksprr is a good substrate for cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  the phosphorylation of kspry  continued to increase linearly even at substrate concentrations at which the phosphorylation of ksprr had plateaued, indicating that cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> might have a stronger affinity for the ksprr peptide but that it can perform the chemical steps of catalysis more efficiently on kspry. we also determined the utilization of ksprk, ksprr, kspry, and histone h <dig> by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> over the same range of substrate concentrations. the phosphorylation of these four substrates increased linearly throughout the concentration range . surprisingly, the phosphorylation of ksprr by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> increased linearly throughout the concentration range, suggesting that activating phosphorylation actually decreased the affinity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> for ksprr. these results differ significantly from those obtained using cdk2-cyclin a, which has a km for phosphorylation of histone h <dig> of  <dig>  μm  <cit> , and for phosphorylation of ksprk of  <dig> μm  <cit> . thus, it appears that weak substrate binding contributed, at least partially, to the low enzymatic activity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> toward these substrates.

phosphorylation of cdc <dig> proteins
the above results indicate that cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes phosphorylate cdk substrates with canonical motifs px poorly compared to cdk2-cyclin a, but that they can phosphorylate non-canonical cdk substrates relatively well. these findings suggested that cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> might efficiently phosphorylate some physiological cdk <dig> substrates containing non-canonical motifs. we reasoned that cdc <dig> proteins might be such substrates. autoamplification of cdc <dig> activity at the g2/m transition was proposed more than a decade ago  <cit> . in this model, cdc <dig> protein phosphatases activate cdc2-cyclin b complexes by removing inhibitory phosphates from cdc <dig>  in turn, active cdc2-cyclin b phosphorylates and activates cdc <dig>  which activates additional cdc2-cyclin b complexes. thus, a low level of cdk activity can be amplified through this positive feedback loop, leading to the concerted activation of cdc <dig> and entry into mitosis. to achieve an abrupt all-or-none activation of cdc <dig> at the right time, it is important that cdc <dig> proteins not be activated at too low a level of cdc <dig> activity. from this point of view, one would predict that cdc <dig> would be a poor cdk substrate. a similar analysis applies to the activation of cdk <dig> complexes by cdc <dig> proteins.

all three mammalian cdc <dig> isoforms  can be phosphorylated on multiple sites by cdk-cyclin complexes . among  <dig> potential cdk phosphorylation sites pxx) in human cdc25a, b, and c , only  <dig> sites fit the consensus cdk phosphorylation motif, and even these are weak fits for phosphorylation by cdk <dig>  since they lack a lysine at the + <dig> position  <cit> . we conclude that most cdk phosphorylation of cdc <dig> proteins occurs on non-canonical motifs. we, therefore, examined whether cdc <dig> proteins could be phosphorylated by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  as shown in fig. 5b, both cdk2-cyclin a and k2a2coexp phosphorylated gst-cdc25a, b, and c. to compare the activities of cdk2-cyclin a and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> toward cdc <dig>  we varied the amounts of cdk2-cyclin a and k2a2coexp used to phosphorylate constant amounts of gst-cdc25a, b, and c. we estimated that the enzymatic activity of cdk2-cyclin a toward the cdc <dig> proteins was 7– <dig> fold higher than that of k2a2coexp. in contrast, cdk2-cyclin a phosphorylated histone h <dig> >1000-fold more efficiently than cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> .

to determine whether cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and cdk2-cyclin a phosphorylate cdc <dig> proteins on the same or different sites, we compared tryptic phosphopeptide maps of cdc <dig> proteins phosphorylated by cdk2-cyclin a  with those phosphorylated by k2a2coexp . each cdc <dig> protein was phosphorylated to about the same extent by each cdk <dig> complex. since there are multiple potential cdk phosphorylation sites in cdc <dig> proteins , it was not surprising that multiple sites were actually phosphorylated. as shown in fig.  <dig>  phosphorylation of each cdc <dig> protein by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and by cdk2-cyclin a produced distinct phosphopeptide patterns. these phosphopeptides could be grouped into two categories. first, many phosphopeptides were unique for either cdk2-cyclin a or cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  indicating a very strong influence of cdk <dig> partner on phosphorylation specificity. for example, spots a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> were unique for cdk2-cyclin a, whereas spots a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and c <dig> were exclusively associated with cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  phosphopeptides in the second group were phosphorylated by both kinases, but to different extents. for example, in the phosphopeptide maps of cdc25a, spots a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> generated by cdk2-cyclin a  appear to be identical to spots a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> generated by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> , respectively. while cdk2-cyclin a phosphorylated site a <dig> more strongly than sites a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> had the opposite site preference. in the phosphopeptide maps of cdc25c, cdk2-cyclin a phosphorylated peptide c <dig> more efficiently than peptide c <dig> whereas cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> phosphorylated c <dig> more efficiently than c <dig>  therefore, cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and cdk2-cyclin a have distinct but partially overlapping substrate preferences on natural substrates.

cdk <dig> activation loop conformation in cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes
we used accessibility to kinases and phosphatases to probe the conformation of the cdk <dig> activation loop in cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes. the activation loop plays an important role in substrate recognition by cdk2-cyclin a as the thr- <dig> phosphate makes direct contact with the + <dig> position of substrates. the strikingly different substrate preferences of cdk2-cyclin a and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> raised the possibility that the activation loop in cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> might adopt a different conformation from that exhibited by cdk2-cyclin a. in addition, like cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  monomeric cdk <dig> displayed low enzymatic activity toward histone h <dig>  and defective substrate binding  <cit> . structural studies indicate that the activation loop in monomeric cdk <dig> is highly disorganized and that only a very small population of cdk <dig> is in the active conformation at any given time  <cit> . this comparison raised the possibility that the activation loop in cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> might also be disordered.

we first probed the t-loop conformation in cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> using budding yeast cak1p. cak1p phosphorylates monomeric cdk <dig> efficiently, but this phosphorylation is inhibited over 95% in the presence of cyclin a  <cit> , presumably because the fixed conformation of the activation loop in cdk2-cyclin a forms a poor substrate for cak1p. a kinase-inactive form of cdk <dig>  was used in this assay to eliminate the high background phosphorylation of speedy/ringo a <dig> by wild-type cdk <dig>  gst-cdk2d145n bound in vitro translated -speedy/ringo a <dig> as well as wild-type cdk <dig> . gst-cdk <dig> was preincubated with increasing amounts of gst-speedy/ringo a <dig> or gst alone before phosphorylation by cak1p. as shown in fig. 7a, the phosphorylation of cdk <dig> by cak1p was reduced in the presence of high concentrations of speedy/ringo a <dig>  indicating that the binding of speedy/ringo a <dig> to cdk <dig> changed the conformation of the activation loop.

we next investigated the t-loop conformation of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> using mammalian cak . monomeric cdks are poor substrates for mammalian cak whereas the binding of cyclin stimulates activating phosphorylation by cak more than seven fold  <cit> . we again used a kinase-inactive form of gst-cdk <dig>  to reduce background phosphorylation of gst-speedy/ringo a <dig> by wild-type cdk <dig>  gst-cdk2d145n alone was slightly phosphorylated by cak . the phosphorylation of gst-cdk2d145n was greatly enhanced in the presence of cyclin a . in contrast, gst-speedy/ringo a <dig> had no effect on the phosphorylation gst-cdk2d145n by cak . the defective phosphorylation of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> by mammalian cak is unlikely to be due to a failure of speedy/ringo a <dig> and gst-cdk2d145n to form a complex. taking these results together, we conclude that binding of speedy/ringo a <dig> alters the activation loop conformation of cdk <dig> , but in a manner distinct from how cyclin a does so . furthermore, it appears that cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> is a poor substrate for mammalian cak.

finally, we examined the t-loop conformation in the cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complex using serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 2c   <cit> . mammalian pp2cα and β can remove the activating phosphate from monomeric cdks such as cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  <cit> . the binding of cyclin a to cdk <dig> prevents dephosphorylation by pp2c  <cit> , presumably because the activation loop becomes locked into a conformation inaccessible to pp2c  <cit> . we tested whether speedy/ringo a <dig>  like cyclin a, can prevent dephosphorylation by pp2cα. gst-cdk2d145n was labeled with -atp using cak1p and purified by gel filtration. 32p-labeled cdk <dig> was preincubated with speedy/ringo a <dig>  cyclin a, or buffer before addition of pp2cα. as described previously  <cit> , cyclin a fully blocked the dephosphorylation of cdk <dig> . the binding of speedy/ringo a <dig> partially blocked the dephosphorylation of cdk <dig> by pp2cα . based on this intermediate result we conclude, as with the cak1p and cak results above, that binding to speedy/ringo a <dig> alters the conformation of the activation loop, but that this conformation differs from that seen after binding of cyclin a.

discussion
the recently discovered speedy/ringo proteins represent a novel class of non-cyclin cdk activators that play important roles in cell cycle progression. xenopus speedy/ringo is necessary for g2/m progression during oocyte maturation and a human speedy/ringo protein  regulates s-phase entry in cultured cells  <cit> . although apparently not present in yeast, plants, and insects, speedy/ringo homologues can be found in the most primitive branching clade of chordates   <cit> , from which all vertebrates evolved. it is conceivable that speedy/ringo proteins regulate cell cycle progression in all vertebrates. although there is no obvious primary sequence similarity between cyclins and speedy/ringo proteins, speedy/ringo proteins can bind to and activate cdks directly  <cit> . in this study, we carried out a biochemical characterization of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes. we verified that human speedy/ringo a <dig> can form a 1: <dig> complex with cdk <dig> and that it can activate cdk <dig> in vitro, even in the absence of phosphorylation of cdk <dig> on thr- <dig> 

however, speedy/ringo a <dig> is not a simple replacement for certain cyclins; there are many important biochemical differences between cyclins and speedy/ringo proteins. first, cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> displays a broad substrate specificity, which is very different from the narrow consensus cdk phosphorylation motif. previous studies showed that cdk2-cyclin a phosphorylated px sequences, with a strong preference for a lysine at the terminal position. we found, using a systematic peptide substrate panel, that the + <dig> position is also the most important residue for cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> recognition. at the + <dig> position, the best substrates for cdk2-cyclin a are ksprk and ksprr , which contain basic residues at the + <dig> position  <cit> . in contrast, the best substrates for cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> contained tyrosine , arginine , and tryptophan  in the + <dig> position, all of which carry bulky side chains. furthermore, cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes could tolerate almost any amino acid residue at the + <dig> position and phosphorylated  <dig> of the  <dig> + <dig> substrates at least 50% as well as ksprk. more than half of the + <dig> substitutions yielded substrates that were phosphorylated more efficiently than ksprk. only alanine, aspartate, and glutamate formed poor substrates, whose relative phosphorylation by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> was still higher than the relative phosphorylation of all but a few of the + <dig> substrates by cdk2-cyclin a.

the second difference between cyclins and speedy/ringo a <dig> is that cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> possesses low enzymatic activity toward conventional cdk substrates, indicating that speedy/ringo a <dig> is unlikely to be able to replace cyclins and promote the full range of cdk <dig> substrate phosphorylation. for example, the activity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> toward histone h <dig> was only ~ <dig> % the activity of cdk2-cyclin a in the standard histone h <dig> kinase assay. therefore, it is unlikely that cdk-speedy/ringo can promote cell cycle progression by itself. the broad tolerance of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> for substitutions at the + <dig> position of substrates and its low activity toward conventional cdk <dig> substrates may go hand in hand. the insensitivity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> to phosphorylation of thr- <dig> on cdk <dig> may also contribute to its low activity toward conventional substrates as this phosphate plays a direct role in substrate recognition via interaction with + <dig> basic residues. indeed, the activation loop conformation adopted by cdk <dig> upon binding speedy/ringo a <dig> appears to differ significantly from that adopted upon cyclin a binding. cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> also appeared to bind substrates, except for ksprr, poorly, which may contribute to its low enzymatic activity.

although it displays a low enzymatic activity toward conventional cdk substrates such as histone h <dig>  cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> actually phosphorylated non-canonical cdk substrates nearly as well as cdk2-cyclin a. we extended this observation made using model substrates to physiological cdk substrates, the cdc <dig> dual-specificity phosphatases. we found that cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> could phosphorylate the three human cdc <dig> proteins quite efficiently, about  <dig> times more efficiently than would be expected based on the histone h <dig> kinase activity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> and only about an order of magnitude less well than cdk2-cyclin a. furthermore, phosphopeptide mapping of cdc <dig> proteins confirmed that the substrate specificity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> overlaps with but is distinct from that of cdk2-cyclin a. it should also be pointed out that, in addition to inherent substrate specificity, some cdks are targeted to some of their substrates. for example, the s-phase cyclins, such as cyclin a and clb <dig>  possess a 'hydrophobic patch' that can interact with the 'rxl' or 'cy' motif present in some substrates to carry out specific functions during dna replication  <cit> . in contrast, phosphorylations of histone h <dig> and gst-peptide substrates are independent of any docking site. thus, for cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  the existence of a docking site on speedy/ringo a <dig> would greatly increase the phosphorylation of select substrates by cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> 

a third difference between cyclins and speedy/ringo a <dig> is that speedy/ringo a <dig> can activate cdk <dig> independent of the activating phosphorylation on thr- <dig> of cdk <dig>  previous studies have shown that xenopus speedy/ringo can activate cdc <dig> and cdk <dig> in vitro in the absence of activating phosphorylation and that it can render cdk <dig> less sensitive to inhibition via inhibitory phosphorylation and binding of ckis such as p <dig>  <cit> . we examined whether activating phosphorylation, though not necessary for phosphorylation of histone h <dig>  might nonetheless affect the substrate specificity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig>  neither the overall catalytic activity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> nor its substrate recognition required the activating phosphorylation of cdk <dig>  in fact, thr- <dig> phosphorylation reduced the activity of cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> toward most of the tested substrates and did not promote activity toward any particular substrate. we also found that cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> is a poor substrate for metazoan cak . these findings indicate that the activation of cdk <dig> by speedy/ringo a <dig> does not require the activating phosphorylation by cak and that it may proceed in the absence of this phosphorylation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified crucial biochemical differences between cdk2-cyclin a and cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes. these findings raise the possibility that speedy/ringo a <dig> could play a significant role in the phosphorylation of cdk substrates containing non-canonical phosphorylation sites and suggest that cdc <dig> proteins might be physiological targets for cdk2-speedy/ringo a <dig> complexes. this is an intriguing possibility given the positive feedback that exists, for instance, between activation of cdc <dig> by cdc <dig> and of cdc <dig> by cdc <dig>  cdk-speedy/ringo complexes – which do not require activating phosphorylation by cak and are less sensitive to inhibitory phosphorylation and cdk inhibitors such as p <dig> – would be in a strong position to jump-start a positive feedback loop or to reverse the inhibition of cdc <dig> caused by stresses such as that caused by dna damage.
