BACKGROUND
conventional methods for studying the genetic architecture of complex traits focus on the level of those traits. in other words, the focus is on variation in trait level among genotypes. this implies that quantitative trait loci  can be defined as mean-controlling genes, as they affect the observed average phenotype of specific genotype. however, in many traits not only the mean is under genetic control, but also variation around the mean. hence, genotypes not only differ in their average phenotypic level, but also in the variation around this average. in the following, we label this phenomenon as “phenotypic variability”, not to be confused with ordinary variability in average trait levels among genotypes. therefore, development and application of statistical methods that allow studying phenotypic variability are required for a better understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits .

the variation around the expected mean of a trait given its genotype, can be studied by analyzing the heterogeneity of residual variance across the observations  <cit> . it has been found that genotypes differ in residual variance  <cit> . empirical evidence was found that the residual variance has a genetic component for litter size in rabbits  <cit> , birth weight in pigs  <cit> , body weight in atlantic salmon  <cit>  and milk production traits in dairy cattle . in addition, some studies have reported qtl that are associated with phenotypic variability, so-called vqtl  <cit> . the presence of vqtl in a population can indicate the existence of unmodeled interaction associated with the locus  <cit> . three types of interactions can be distinguished, in which vqtl could be involved: interaction between the genes   <cit> , interaction between the gene and known/unknown environmental factors  <cit>  or parallel presence of both of those interactions  <cit> . the fourth type of vqtl is one that controls the variance of a trait  <cit> . several studies have reported vqtl in plant  and animal species . one of the most well-studied genes involved in buffering effects of genetic and environmental factors is heat-shock protein  <dig> . this gene was described in drosophila and arabidopsis as a gene stabilizing developmental and morphological traits .

in this study, we focus on litter size and its variability in a large white pig population. many studies have reported single nucleotide polymorphisms  and qtl for the mean litter size of a genotype, and such qtl have been found on all sus scrofa chromosomes  except ssc <dig>  sscx and sscy . however, on top of the genetic variance in litter size, there is considerable residual variation between sows for litter size . most issues are caused by extremely large litters , which exceeds the physiological capacity of the sow to provide for the litter during gestation and post-farrowing. sows with the large litters can experience welfare issues such as high energy demands during gestation  <cit>  and shoulder sores during lactation  <cit> . moreover, these extreme litter sizes reduce also welfare and survival of the piglets pre-farrowing and until weaning. in current pig breeding, the goal is towards more sustainable production that will increase piglet survival regardless of increasing litter size . decreasing the variation in litter size between sows could lead to more sustainable breeding in terms of lower mortality of piglets and easier to manage sows. therefore, it is desirable to reduce the variation in litter size from both an economic and an animal welfare perspective. moreover, the detection of genes that buffer environmental factors, and thus decrease the variability of tnb is highly desirable. thus far, sorensen and waagepetersen  <cit> , rönnegård et al.  <cit>  and felleki et al.  <cit>  showed on the same dataset that variability in total number born in pigs is heritable. however, no study reported genomic regions associated with litter size variability or other traits in pigs  <cit> . a genome-wide association study  for variability of litter size would give more insight in the genetic and biological control of variability in litter size.

the main objective of this study was to identify snps associated with litter size  and its variation , through a multi-snp gwas applying a bayesian method. in total,  <dig> snps were detected for tnb and  <dig> snps for vartnb. the most significant snp for tnb was detected on ssc <dig> and for vartnb on ssc <dig>  a possible candidate gene for tnb on ssc <dig> is enox <dig>  which is involved in cell growth and survival. on ssc <dig>  two possible candidate genes for vartnb are located. the first is a gene coding a swine heat shock protein  <dig> , which is a well-studied gene stabilizing morphological traits in drosophila and arabidopsis. the second is vegfa, which is activated in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the fetus. we also found a positive genetic correlation between tnb and its variance, indicating that single-trait selection for tnb will increase the vartnb. to our knowledge, this is the first study reporting snps for tnb on ssc <dig> and snps associated with vartnb in pigs.

RESULTS
the main objective of this study was to detect regions associated with litter size  and its variation  in a large white pig population using a genome-wide association study . prior to the gwas, the phenotypes for the association study had to be obtained. therefore, as the first step, a double hierarchical glm  was used to estimate variance components and estimated breeding values  of tnb and vartnb. second, the ebv obtained with dhglm were deregressed. finally, the deregressed ebv were used as phenotypes in the gwas. in this section, we present and discuss all the results that lead to detecting regions associated with tnb and vartnb.

dhglm analysis of litter size and its variation
table  <dig> shows estimates of variance components and heritability obtained from the univariate analysis of tnb, which are within the range known from the literature, where heritability estimates for tnb range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the variance components estimated with univariate analysis of tnb were used as starting values for dhglm.table  <dig> genetic parameters  from a conventional univariate analysis of litter size 



the variance components and heritability for tnb from the dhglm presented in table  <dig> are also in the expected range . for vartnb the estimate of additive genetic variance and heritability  are lower than previously reported for this trait  <cit> . it is worth noticing, that this heritability is a measure of the reliability of ebv for vartnb based on single observations; it does not reflect the magnitude of the genetic variance in vartnb  <cit> .table  <dig> variance components  estimated in large white sows for litter size  and residual variance of litter size  using a double hierarchical glm  and for mean litter size per sow  and log-transformed variance of the tnb per sow ) using conventional bivariate analysis

permanent sow effect/residuala

athe conventional analysis has no permanent sow effect, since there is only a single observation per sow. the correlation was estimated between residuals in two parts of the model



to show the potential response to selection we propose to use the genetic coefficient of variation on the standard deviation level . the gcvsde for vartnb in this study is  <dig> , which is slightly lower than in previous studies focusing on litter size variation in pigs , as reviewed by hill and mulder  <cit> . nonetheless, the gcvsde reported here indicates sufficient potential for selection to reduce variation in tnb. by assuming that in an efficient breeding program a response of ~ <dig> genetic standard deviation per generation can be achieved, the gcvsde of  <dig>  indicates that the genetic standard deviation  of tnb can be reduced by 9 % in one generation.

table  <dig> shows the genetic correlations between random effects in the level and variance part of the model. the additive genetic correlation between tnb and vartnb is positive and moderate . this correlation is unfavorable, and indicates that sows with genetically large litters tend to have more variation in litter size. the correlation between the permanent sow effects on tnb and vartnb has the opposite sign: − <dig> . this indicates that non-genetic  disturbances decrease the mean of tnb, with simultaneous increase in the variance of this trait.

to investigate further the large difference between the permanent and genetic correlations obtained with the dhglm, we also performed a conventional bivariate analysis. to compare methods, models need to be on the same scale. a dhglm takes a logarithm of residual variance in exponential model. thus, in the conventional analysis we used mean tnb and the log-transformed variance of mean tnb )) per sow. the estimated additive genetic variances for mean tnb and for log) were similar to values obtained from the dhglm . the conventional bivariate analysis yields also correlations between additive genetic effects and residuals of mean tnb and log) .  the estimated additive genetic correlation was  <dig> , whereas the residual correlation was– <dig> . the genetic correlation has the same sign as the one from the dhglm, but is slightly different in magnitude. the residual correlation in the conventional analysis has the same sign as the permanent environment correlation in the dhglm, but is much closer to zero. when considering the covariances rather than the correlations, the residual covariance from the conventional analysis  exceeds the permanent covariance from the dhglm . in the dhglm, we assumed that the residuals are independent from each other. hence, in the dhglm, the permanent covariance has to account fully for non-genetic covariance between tnb and vartnb, which probably causes the extremely negative correlation between permanent effects.

felleki et al.  <cit>  reported an additive genetic correlation of– <dig>  between tnb and vartnb, which has the opposite sign to the value reported here. the model used by felleki et al.  <cit> , however, did not include a covariance for permanent sow effect. when this covariance is not included, the model does not separate the effects properly. when the permanent covariance was omitted in our study, the additive genetic correlation had a negative value of– <dig> . to account fully for all existing effects it is necessary to include the covariance structure between both permanent and additive genetic effects in the two parts of the model.

significant associations for tnb and vartnb
in total,  <dig> significant snps were detected for tnb  and  <dig> snps for vartnb . associations found for tnb where located mostly on the same sus scrofa chromosomes  as reported in previous gwas for this trait  <cit> . since this is the first gwas to report snps for variance of litter size in pigs, there are no studies available for comparison.fig.  <dig> genome-wide association for litter size  in  <dig>  purebred boars and sows from a large white pig population. red circles indicate snps with bf ≥ <dig>  red triangles indicate snp with bf ≥ <dig> and black dots indicate snps with bf <30

overall, the significant snps explained  <dig>  % of the total genetic variance in tnb, and  <dig>  % of the genetic variance in vartnb . the snps reported on scc <dig> for tnb and all the snps for vartnb are the first snps reported for those traits in pigs. the chromosomes with the most variance explained were ssc <dig> for tnb and ssc <dig> for vartnb . on ssc <dig>  asga <dig> associated with tnb explained  <dig>  % of the total genetic variance. the estimated allele substitution effect at this locus was  <dig>  piglets . previous studies that detected qtl for tnb, reported percentage of phenotypic variance explained by markers, rather than genetic variance, on the level between  <dig>  % to 15 % , so higher than in this study. on ssc <dig>  inra <dig> explained  <dig>  % of the genetic variance for vartnb. the allele substitution effect at this locus was  <dig>  % of the mean value of vartnb . the small proportion of genetic variance explained by the significant associations indicates that both litter size and its variation are highly polygenic traits.table  <dig> significant snps per sus scrofa chromosome  associated with litter size and detected in boars and sows from a large white pig population. description of significant regions includes: minor allele frequency , allele substitution effect and the bayes factor  as an indication for significance

the estimated genetic correlation between tnb and its variation  could suggest presence of pleiotropic effects or snps in linkage disequilibrium . however, we did not identify overlap in regions significant for tnb and vartnb . only on ssc <dig>  snps for both traits are located close to each other , but they are not in ld.

candidate genes and qtl associated with tnb
the two regions detected on ssc <dig> are the first snps associated with tnb on this chromosome. thus far, no other study available in pigqtldb  reported significant associations for tnb on ssc <dig>  only one study reported qtl for a reproduction trait within the region of the most significant snp  for tnb, which was a qtl for number of teats  <cit> .

no candidate genes could be identified within the region of ±50kbp around asga <dig> . the nearest candidate gene named enox <dig> was found at  <dig> - <dig>  mb. one of the snps associated with tnb  was located in this region. the enox <dig> is a protein coding gene from the ecto-cnox family being part of electron transport pathways associated with mitochondrial membranes  <cit> . functions of enox <dig> are cellular defense and growth as well as cell survival  <cit> . the functions of enox <dig> indicate that this gene might be a new region relevant for tnb in pigs.

in addition, the region detected on ssc <dig>  shows relevance for tnb in pigs. three qtl related to reproduction traits were previously described within this region . those qtl were for: tnb  <cit> , corpus luteum number  <cit> , and gestation length  <cit> . moreover, we have identified a possible candidate gene from the galectin family named lgals <dig> within the detected region. the lgals <dig> is widely expressed in tumoral tissues and seems to be involved in integrin-like cell interactions, cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix interaction and growth regulation  <cit> .

candidate genes and qtl for variability of tnb
quantitative trait loci associated with phenotypic variability are defined in the literature as vqtl  <cit> . in this study, the snps associated with vartnb are the first vqtl reported in pigs. detected snps for vartnb were located at the positions of several known qtl related to reproduction traits in pigs. those qtl are summarized in table  <dig> 

within the region of the most significant snp  for vartnb at  <dig>  mb on ssc <dig>  one candidate gene was located named cul <dig>  cul <dig> is a cytoplasmic anchor protein in complex associated with p <dig>  <cit> . the p <dig> is a protein, which regulates the cycle of the cell and acts as a tumor suppressor  <cit> . the cul <dig> is controlling the localization and the function of p <dig> in the cell  <cit> . even though cul <dig> was not yet described in swine, its functions can be important in affecting litter size variability in pigs, especially since cul <dig> is expressed in embryonic, placental, and uterus tissues in the human  <cit> .

two more snps on ssc <dig> associated with vartnb  were located within the regions of two other possible candidate genes already described in swine: hspcb  and vegfa . the first gene belongs to the sus scrofa heat shock protein family. this protein family is referred to as molecular chaperones since they are activated under various stress condition, such as heat  <cit> , hyperthermia  <cit> , and inflammation  <cit> . their function is to maintain proper folding of the proteins within a cell as well as re-folding denatured proteins post-stress  <cit> . known in drosophila and arabidopsis as hsp <dig>  it is well described as a gene stabilizing developmental and morphological traits. the hsp <dig> was describe to buffer environmental  and genetic  factors, resulting in low variation of developmental and morphological traits . even though hsp <dig> was shown to be one of many genes with buffering effects  <cit> , it is a very promising candidate gene detected for vartnb in this study. the second gene, named vegfa, is a vascular endothelial growth factor. a vegfa is a protein mediator growth factor activated in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the fetus   <cit>  as well as in endothelial cell growth  <cit> . these two candidate genes detected on ssc <dig> are highly relevant, since those genes affect the response of the pig to environmental and stress factors  and provide the vascular network to the placenta .

implications for pig breeding
an important aim in pig production is to obtain a high number of slaughter pigs per sow per year  <cit> . therefore, in pig breeding, genetic selection continues to increase litter size. the annual genetic trend for litter size in different pig breeding programs was shown to be + <dig>   <cit> , + <dig>   <cit> , and even up to + <dig>   <cit>  piglets per year on average. next to genetic variation in litter size, there is considerable residual variation in this trait, both between sows and between parities within a sow.

we showed that residual variance in litter size has a genetic component, and can thus be changed by selection. the results of our study also show presence of an unfavorable positive genetic correlation between litter size and its variation. so far, main inefficiency in fecundity was the presence of too small litters. more and more, however, too large litters are becoming the prevailing problem. therefore, simultaneous selection of litter size and it variation is necessary to achieve a higher mean litter size and at the same time a lower variance in litter size. this is important for pig production, since both small and oversized litters can be detrimental for farm economy. although the genetic correlation was  <dig> , we did not identify overlap in regions significant for tnb and vartnb .

current breeding programs can use the knowledge of this study in the genomic evaluation of selection candidates. genomic selection can greatly increase accuracy of selection also for non-phenotyped individuals. this is beneficial for traits such as litter size variability, which has low heritability and is recorded only long after the moment of selection of the candidate.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first study reporting snps for tnb on ssc <dig> and first snps associated with vartnb in pigs. in total,  <dig> snps were detected for tnb and  <dig> snps for vartnb. the most significant snp for tnb was detected on ssc <dig>  a possible candidate gene for tnb on ssc <dig>  named enox <dig>  is involved in cell growth and survival. also on ssc <dig>  another possible candidate gene for tnb is located, named lgals <dig>  two genes located on ssc <dig>  are the most promising candidate genes identified for vartnb. the hspcb is coding the heat-shock protein involved in buffering environmental and genetic factors, whereas vegfa is activated in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the fetus. we also found a positive genetic correlation between tnb and its variation. this indicates that in breeding practice simultaneous selection of those traits is necessary to achieve a higher mean litter size and lower variance of this trait. the snps detected in this study can be used as an indication for regions in the sus scrofa genome involved in maintaining low variability of litter size, but further studies are needed to confirm causative mutations.
