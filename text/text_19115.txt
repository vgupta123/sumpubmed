BACKGROUND
meiotic recombination is important for generating genetic diversity. meiotic recombination occurs between homologous chromosomes during chiasmata formation, a process that is required for normal chromosomal segregation during meiosis. while variation in recombination rates is a ubiquitous feature of the human genome  <cit> , the mechanisms governing the distribution of crossovers along meiotic chromosomes remain largely unclear, with the exception of the recent discovery that prdm <dig> is involved in the activation of mammalian recombination hotspots  <cit> . sex-specific effects  <cit>  on regional meiotic recombination have been described. recombination rates are approximately  <dig> -fold higher in female meiosis than in male meiosis. in addition, crossover rates in males are 5-fold lower near centromeres but 10-fold higher near telomeres compared with those in females  <cit> . these differences could be related to sex-specific patterns of initiation of synapses between homologs. for example, synaptonemal complex lengths are shorter in males than in females  <cit> , and synapses appear preferentially in subtelomeric regions in males  <cit> .

meiotic recombination events can be measured directly or indirectly  <cit> . physical crossovers between homologous chromosomes, indicating meiotic recombination events, can be directly observed at specific time points during spermatogenesis  <cit> . alternatively, crossovers may be analyzed directly in cytogenetic analysis by labeling meiosis-related proteins, such as mlh <dig>  <cit> . despite the unequivocal value of direct analysis, these techniques are labor-intensive and precision is limited. therefore, most analyses of human recombination currently rely on indirect approaches such as genetic linkage analysis of human pedigrees. this involves tracking the inheritance of alleles at multiple polymorphic markers  along the chromosomes across generations  <cit> .

molecular markers in individuals with known pedigrees can be traced to an ancestral identity using either the identity by descent  method  <cit>  or the identity by state  method  <cit> . two alleles at a particular locus in the progeny are assumed to be identical if they are derived from an identical locus in a common ancestor. the ibd method requires knowledge of the genotypes of three generations to determine if the dna segments are identical by descent from each generation. in the ibd method, shared results between each child and his/her paternal and maternal grandparents are analyzed separately. a paternal recombination event is detected when the ibd sharing "switches" from one paternal grandparent to the other. this application can be applied in the same manner for the maternal side. for instance, meiotic events can be switched between  <dig> snp sites . therefore, application of the ibd method requires the pedigrees of three generations  <cit> . the ibs method was used to detect meiotic recombination sites between individuals by analyzing allele sharing between siblings  <cit> . recently, ting et al. also proposed another method for identifying meiotic recombination patterns based on two-generation pedigrees   <cit> . in the pedisnp method, genotypes of two children are analyzed and compared with the genotype of one parent  <cit> .

based on the distribution of snps in both parents and multiple siblings, meiotic cross sites in human chromosomes can be identified. this method was first proposed by coop et al. in  <dig> to trace the "informative markers" transmitted by the father to each offspring  <cit> . they defined the "informative markers" as snps that are heterozygous in the father and homozygous in the mother. in  <dig>  chowdhury et al. used two datasets, namely, the autism genetic research exchange  and the framingham heart study , to characterize the variation in recombination phenotypes  <cit> . they analyzed sex differences and recombination jungles across the human genome, and described the gene loci associated with recombination phenotypes  <cit> .

in this study, we have used a parent-sibling tracing  approach, which was derived from two previous reports  <cit> , to analyze the genomic medicine research core laboratory, taiwan  dataset of affymetrix snp <dig>  arrays which consists of  <dig> k snp markers and the gse <dig> dataset from gene expression omnibus   <cit> , which consists of  <dig> families. our analyses of this dataset of  <dig>  meioses resulted in a 1-mb-resolution recombination map. in addition, we were able to characterize the relationships between recombination sites and repetitive elements as well as the relationships between recombination sites and tandem repeats sequences.

RESULTS
comparison of two methods of detecting meiotic recombination sites
we used the gmrcl dataset of  <dig> k snps as a reference standard for comparison between the pst approach  and previous approaches such as the ibd method  <cit>  . the code calling schema of pst is depicted in figure 1b and additional file 1b. using chromosome  <dig> as an example, ibd analysis in both children could define the sites of meiotic recombination for paternal gametes. in child  <dig> and child  <dig>  we observed  <dig> and  <dig> meiotic recombination events on their paternal gametes, respectively . using the pst approach, we could analyze the paternal genotypes for both children. when the paternal genotype was aa and the maternal genotype was aa, children with aa and aa were coded as "0: not identical between siblings". if both children were aa and aa , they were coded as "1: identical between siblings" . the pst approach  detected the recombination sites of the combinatorial results for child  <dig> and child  <dig> as determined by ibd . these results indicate that, using the snp information of only two generations, pst can identify the origin of the recombination site. for the ibd method, information from three generations is required to determine whether the origin is from the grandfather or the grandmother. the  <dig> recombination sites identified in the gmrcl dataset using the ibd and pst methods are shown in additional file  <dig> 

comparison of the code calling schemas between the ibd and pst methods showed that ibd identified fewer genotyping combination calls than the pst approach. for instance, when we analyzed the recombination sites in the 100-kb genomic region located at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> , the numbers of uninformative snps in the recombination site for the ibd and pst methods were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively , resulting in uninformative regions of  <dig> kb for the ibd method  and  <dig> kb for the pst approach , respectively.

the use of the ibd and pst methods in the gmrcl sample led to the identification of  <dig> paternal recombination sites in child  <dig> and child  <dig>  the mean numbers of uninformative snp for the  <dig> paternal recombination sites were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the ibd and pst methods, respectively . the mean sizes of the uninformative regions for the  <dig> paternal recombination sites were  <dig> ±  <dig> kb  with  <dig>  in q <dig>  for the ibd method, and  <dig> ±  <dig> kb with  <dig>  in q <dig>  for the pst approach . the paired t-test showed that the pst approach resulted in significantly shorter uninformative regions than the ibd method .

analysis of the geo dataset gse <dig> containing  <dig>  snp markers
the affymetrix human mapping  <dig> k  <dig>  arrays  were used to map autism susceptibility loci in the gse <dig> dataset  <cit> . three three-generation pedigrees  were selected to compare the usefulness of the ibd and pst methods. since the  <dig> k  <dig>  array covered fewer snps, the mean size of uninformative regions were about 20-fold higher and the number of uninformative snps was approximately 6-fold lower than those of snp  <dig>  arrays. compared to other approaches, the pst approach identified fewer uninformative snps and smaller uninformative genomic regions .

in the  <dig> arrays  analyzed using the pst approach, the mean number of maternal recombination events was approximately  <dig> -fold higher than that of paternal origin, with the highest value observed on chromosome  <dig>  and the lowest on chromosome  <dig>  . the distribution of recombination events of paternal origin  and maternal origin  is presented in figure 3a. the numbers of recombination events of each chromosome  are summarized in table  <dig> 

* p value <  <dig>  

in order to identify the regions with the highest and the lowest number of recombination events, we scanned the entire human genome. we first divided the genome into  <dig>  bins of 1-mb each. we then identified the number of recombination sites in each bin separately for female and male meioses. the results obtained from chromosome  <dig> are shown in figure 3b . we also compared the recombination maps obtained from dataset gse <dig> with marshfield map  <cit>  , and icelandic map  <cit>  . the correlation coefficients between the data in gse <dig> map and icelandic map and marshfield map were r =  <dig>  and r =  <dig> , respectively.

to test the hypothesis that recombination rates are lower near the centromere but higher near the telomeres in men, we analyzed the correlation between the distances from the recombination sites to the centromere and the number of recombination sites. we found significant correlations  on chromosomes 1q, 2p, 3q, 4q, 5p, 5q, 6p, 6q, 7q, 8q, 9p, 9q, 10p, 10q, 11q, 12p, 12q, 16q, 18q, 19q, 20q, 21q in men. in contrast, similar correlations were found only on chromosome 1q and 6q in women . for instance, the slope of correlation was significant in p arm of chromosome  <dig> in men but not in women . on the other hand, both sexes showed significant correlations in the number of recombination sites near the telomere in the q arm. snp information was not available for the p arm of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>

relation between the recombination site and repetitive elements
we compiled  <dig> major repetitive element classes that were characterized by repeatmasker  <cit> . twenty-three repetitive-element classes were identified in more than  <dig>  sites in the human genome. after downloading the location information of the human cpg islands from the ucsc database  <cit> , we divided the genome into  <dig>  bins of 1-mb each and determined the number of repetitive-element sites in each bin. using the  <dig>  repetitive-elements on chromosome  <dig> as an example, we depicted the distribution of sine/mir  and line/l <dig> sites . in addition, the distributions of meiotic recombination sites  are shown as blue lines. in each 1-mb bin, we also analyzed the correlation between the number of meiotic recombination sites and the number of sine/mir  and line/l <dig> sites . the correlation coefficients between recombination sites and sine/mir and the correlation coefficients between recombination sites and line/l <dig> were  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively.

the correlation coefficients and the corresponding p values for each of the  <dig> repetitive-elements, cpg island sites, and meiotic recombination sites are summarized in table  <dig>  the repetitive elements sine/mir, dna/hat-charlie, dna/hat, line/l <dig>  sine/alu, dna/hat-tip <dig>  dna/hat-blackjack were positively correlated with meiotic recombination sites. in contrast, repetitive elements, which included line/l <dig>  ltr/ervk, and low complexity , showed negative correlation with meiotic recombination sites. in general, we found no significant differences in the distribution of maternal and paternal recombination sites. the scatter plots of the correlation analyses of repetitive elements sine/mir and line/l <dig> in the entire human genome are shown in figure  <dig>

relation between recombination sites and the length of tandem repeat sequences
repetitive elements, including tandem repeat sequences, are distributed widely throughout the genome. tandem dna repeats are defined as a repeated pattern of two or more nucleotides. the pattern can range in length from  <dig> to ~ <dig> base pairs  n in a genomic region)  <cit> . in this study, a total  <dig>  tandem repeats sequences were identified using the tandem repeats finder  <cit> . the length distribution of the tandem repeats are shown in figure 6a, where the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> percentile of the length of the tandem repeats were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively.

we divided the genome into  <dig>  bins of 1-mb each and determined the number of tandem repeats in each bin. we then analyzed the correlation between the number of maternal meiotic recombination sites and the number of tandem repeats ; the correlation coefficient was  <dig>  . furthermore, we grouped tandem repeats into  <dig> quartiles by the length of these repeat sequences, as  1- <dig>   5- <dig>   16- <dig> and  >  <dig> bp. the correlation coefficients between recombination sites and the  <dig> quartiles were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively . these results showed that the maternal meiotic recombination sites were positively correlated with shorter repeat sequences and less correlated with longer repeat sequences. similarly, we analyzed the correlation between the number of paternal meiotic recombination sites and the number of tandem repeats, with r =  <dig>  . the correlation coefficients for the  <dig> subgroups were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively .

discussion
in this study, we use a pst approach to analyze the sites of meiotic recombination in two-generation pedigrees. we first tested it on a gmrcl dataset of the affymetrix snp  <dig>  array consisting of  <dig> k snp markers, followed by a  <dig> k gse <dig> dataset. in the gse <dig> dataset, which was previously used for mapping autism risk loci, most data are based on two-generation pedigrees  as this dataset contains only  <dig> three-generation pedigrees. although the pst approach requires only pedigrees of two generations, it requires information from at least two siblings. the use of snps as genetic markers to identify recombination sites can often result in the inclusion of uninformative regions. however, the size of uninformative regions that result from the pst approach is significantly lower than that seen from the use of the ibd method .

we next assessed whether crossovers may alter the dna sequence by causing de novo mutations at sites of recombination. given that the uninformative regions of pst were relatively small, eight recombination events were identified with sizes of less than  <dig> kb. notably, we did not identify any sequence variation at these recombination points . this observation needs further validation by sequencing more datasets.

the average number of recombination events observed with the pst approach was similar to the findings of other studies. the distribution of recombination events showed a mean value of  <dig>  in paternal origin and  <dig>  in maternal origin. chowdhury et al reported the genome-wide recombination events in paternal origin ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  while in maternal origin ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . another study by cheung et al demonstrated that the mean numbers of recombination events were  <dig>  in male meiosis and  <dig>  in female meiosis  <cit> .

in an indirect pedigree analysis using snps as genetic markers, cheung et al  <cit>  reported that several recombination events appeared to occur nearer to the telomeres. using the pst approach, we analyzed the distance between the recombination site and the centromere for each gender separately . in male meiosis, most of the crossovers are located in the q arms, and the number of recombination events increased significantly when moving from centromeres to telomeres. interestingly, we observed fewer recombination events in the p arms of female chromosomes, resulting in the male-to-female ratio of  <dig>  . in women, only chromosomes 1q and 6q showed a significant, positive correlation between the number of recombination sites and distance from the centromere .

to determine the extensive sequence-context variation in recombination hotspots, myers et al. constructed a fine-scale map of recombination rates and hotspots across the human genome based on genotypes of  <dig>  million snps in three sample populations, including  <dig> european americans,  <dig> african americans, and  <dig> han chinese  <cit> . the authors reported an increase of recombination hotspots in the regions surrounding coding genes, though these were preferentially located outside the transcribed regions. the analysis of the relationships between recombination hotspots and repeat elements indicated that l <dig> and the1b are unusually high in hotspots, whereas l <dig> elements are low  <cit> . in this study, we identified a similar pattern of frequent hotspots in l <dig> as opposed to the low number of hotspots in l <dig> elements . of note, results showed that the majority of the hotspots in both paternal and maternal meioses were similar.

CONCLUSIONS
human chromosomes are characterized by prominent differences in the pattern and rate of meiotic recombination events. significant inter-individual and gender differences also exist. the major advantages of the pst approach include the use of two-generation pedigrees with two or more siblings, fewer uninformative snp regions, and the ability to perform gender-specific analyses of recombination hotspots  and repetitive elements. an accurate determination of meiotic crossovers using this approach may prove useful to explore the biology of human chromosomes.
