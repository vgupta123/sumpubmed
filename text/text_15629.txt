BACKGROUND
limb development has fascinated biologists for a century, mostly because of the importance of these structures in the evolution of land vertebrates and due to their spectacular morphological diversity. from an experimental viewpoint, limbs are quite easily accessible at various stages of their ontogenesis and can thus be manipulated, to some extent. genetically speaking, limb phenotypes can be easily detected and usually do not impair survival too strongly. for all these reasons, limbs have been excellent model structures to study vertebrate patterning and morphogenesis.

tetrapods limbs bud out from the lateral plate mesoderm and establish early on the bases of a three-dimensional pattern. the growth along the proximo-distal axis largely depends on fgfs signaling emanating from the apical ectodermal ridge  and acting over the mesenchyme. on the other hand, the anterior to posterior  axis is specified essentially by hand <dig>  the shh pathway and posterior hoxd genes. amongst the known regulators of the dorso-ventral  patterning are wnt7a, expressed in dorsal ectoderm, and engrailed, in ventral ectoderm, as well as lmxb <dig>  a gene transcribed in dorsal mesenchyme. these signaling cascades act together in a highly coordinated manner  <cit> .

at later stages of development, e.g. starting from e <dig>  onwards in mice, mesenchymal condensations form and establish the future skeletal pattern, following a tightly regulated process. the first elements to appear are those of the future stylopod , then of the zeugopod  and, finally, the autopod . this period of limb development, referred to as 'proliferative expansion, determination and differentiation'  <cit> , is a very dynamic phase, where differences amongst tetrapods start to be translated from the genetics  to species-specific morphologies. such differences in the shapes of tetrapod limbs, may rely upon slight variations in these 'genetic' parameters, such as transcriptional heterochronies or quantitative effects of key developmental molecules  <cit> .

while many of those genes critical for limb development were described over the past  <dig> years, additional players, such as regulatory rnas, have come into play more recently. there is indeed increasing evidence that long non-coding rnas  may be crucial for some developmental processes  <cit>  due to their involvement in various functions including gene regulation, both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, in the organization of epigenetic modifications  <cit>  as well as during gene activation and silencing  <cit> . surprisingly, inter-species sequence conservation does not seem to be essential  <cit> , even in the cases of the xist, air or evf- <dig> rnas where important functions were demonstrated  <cit> . the best-studied long ncrnas are associated with imprinted gene clusters, where many of them act by repressing neighboring genes via a cis-effect  <cit> .

as a resource for research projects involving gene expression and regulation in developing mouse limbs, we set up to produce and analyze whole genome expression data for e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  forelimbs. we selected these three stages of embryonic limb development not only because these days are very dynamic, in terms of growth and organogenesis, but also because the transcriptional activation of several known genes occurs during this time-period, giving us both an idea of the relevance of the datasets, and the possibility to look at the vicinities of these loci to evaluate a potential clustering of transcriptional activities. within this time-window indeed, the muscular and skeletal systems develop in parallel with massive vascularization, innervations and skin formation, implying large amounts of new cell types and tissue interactions. we selected three different ontogenetic stages to see how global transcriptional activity evolves along with development of a complex structure, not only by considering protein coding genes, but also intergenic transcription and non-coding rna expression.

RESULTS
we sampled mouse embryonic forelimbs at days  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  postco√Øtum, by cutting off the entire forelimb buds from the body wall . the particular morphogenetic events occurring at these stages have been largely described earlier . briefly, e <dig>  limb buds consist of a rather poorly differentiated inner mesenchyme, located within an epidermal envelope. despite this apparent uniformity, mesenchymal cells at this stage can be already differentiated as belonging to denser, centrally located regions where condensation of the future cartilage rods starts to occur  <cit> . these condensations appear with a time sequence that follows a proximal to distal progression. at the same stage, the first nerve fascicles become apparent, originating from the brachial plexus.

by day  <dig> , the cartilage primordia of the future limb skeleton are already well defined, the digits start to separate from one another as a result of inter-digital cell death. there is massive deposition of muscle elements , nerves extend into the hand plates and few hair buds are already apparent. the limbs are fully vascularised and the skin starts to stratify. embryonic forelimbs at day  <dig>  have completely separated digits. the ossification process, which starts around e <dig> , is in progress even in the most distal phalanges. most of the tendons are now well defined and there is strong progression of skin stratification.

expression signals are frequently confined to known transcript boundaries but tend to extend past the 3'ends of genes
following rna extraction and processing  labelled cdnas were hybridized onto whole genome tiling arrays . after data normalization  we used the ucsc known gene annotation system  to quantify expression levels in exons, introns and intergenic regions. intensity thresholds to determine expressed transcripts and genes were calculated for each array, as exemplified by using chromosome  <dig> . distributions showed low intensities both in introns and intergenic regions, with introns showing slightly higher signals possibly reflecting precursor mrnas or splice forms not covered by our annotation. in contrast the distributions for exons were clearly shifted towards higher expression. we also observed a bias in intensity around annotated transcripts since the signals in regions downstream of the annotated transcript ends were usually more pronounced and decayed more slowly than in regions upstream of the transcription start sites . also, in several cases, the 3' untranslated regions  were much longer than anticipated from the ucsc known gene annotation . overall, we observed that transcription was mostly confined to the vicinity of annotated genes, a finding that is consistent with rna-seq studies in mouse and human  <cit> , though some novel transcription sites were found .

about 40% of known genes are expressed at e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig> 
the global expression data for individualized exons, transcripts and genes at the three developmental stages are shown in table  <dig> .  <dig> %,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of known genes were expressed in forelimbs at e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig> , respectively. based on ucsc gene models, about 90% of these were annotated as coding genes . interestingly about 95% of all expressed genes were common to the three developmental stages, with an average increase of 4% between e <dig>  towards e <dig>  limbs .

a: ucsc known gene expression and gene model categories. b: intronic transcription. numbers in parentheses shows those intronic transcripts for which the genes containing them were also expressed. c: transcription of intergenic regions and sub-categories . the 'unexplained' category represents transcribed intergenic regions remaining after filtering .

differential gene expression
we compared the expressed genes between the three developmental stages to evaluate which percentage was significantly changed along with limb development . between e <dig>  and e <dig> , we identified  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes . between e <dig>  and e <dig>  forelimbs,  <dig> genes were found up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. while these figures indicate that the general tendency goes towards an increase in the number of genes expressed, along with developmental time, they should be considered carefully since they derive from comparisons between steady-state levels of rnas. consequently, they do not necessarily reflect transcriptional switches and may point to rnas whose transcription has increased, in the case of a gene considered as 'newly expressed'. likewise, rna stability may prevent, in some cases, the timely detection of a particular transcriptional switch-off. in addition, the cellular topographies of gene expression patterns are usually not homogenous and hence variations in relative transcript abundance may also indicate variations in space rather than in time .

we looked into these parameters by quantitative pcrs on some of the genes, for which changes in expression patterns had been previously reported . in addition, six genes with either known or unknown expression profiles, were validated by in situ hybridization . as examples, the cbln <dig> mrna, essential during synapse formation  <cit>  yet with previously unknown profile, was weakly expressed at e <dig>  only, whereas the tmem8c gene was specifically expressed in early muscle elements along both the trunk and the limb and progressively increased its expression throughout development.

to evaluate whether differentially expressed genes could be grouped into particular functional categories, we used the ingenuity knowledge base http://www.ingenuity.com. this analysis indicated that functional categories such as muscle and skeletal system development, or skin development were enriched, as expected from the developmental stages under scrutiny . we also performed a more detailed gene ontology analyses using gominer  <cit> , to see if development related terms were enriched in our sets of differentially expressed genes. functions were clustered into hierarchical trees  and the results showed that terms related to muscle development again dominated, both when e <dig>  limbs were compared with e <dig> , and when e <dig>  limbs were compared with e <dig> . this is most likely due to high number of genes encoding muscle structural proteins. cartilage, bone, and cell-adhesion related term enrichments were also scored. noteworthy, the number of functional clusters was higher between e <dig>  and e <dig>  than between the two younger stages, which reflects an increased tissue diversification along with the processing of limb development. we matched our sets of differentially expressed genes with the mammalian phenotype database http://www.informatics.jax.org and scored  <dig> genes that had been previously associated with abnormal or short limb morphology .

*fisher's exact tests were used to calculate p-values.

intronic and intergenic transcription
although we applied a rather stringent threshold, we observed extensive intronic transcription, since about  <dig> percent of expressed genes also contained signals  covering intronic sequences . while, in some instances, this can be explained by introns retained after splicing, the majority of this intronic activity seems to derive either from alternative start sites, as suggested by looking at some profiles of histone post-translational modification tracks from various cell types in the ucsc genome browser  <cit> , or from alternative transcription termination, which seems to occur frequently in human or mouse genes and can thus lead to intronic transcription  <cit> . in addition, about  <dig> percent of these intronic signals were detected within genes that are not expressed during limb development, indicating the presence of independent transcription units overlapping with known genes.

we also scored  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcribed regions above threshold , at e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig> , respectively, within intergenic regions . we further filtered this raw data using the ensembl database for possible overlaps and approximately  <dig> percent of these sequences were thus identified. half of these matched protein coding genes, whereas the other half was composed of pseudogenes and retrotransposed elements . protein coding genes showed  <dig> percent parity with ucsc coding genes which, due to different annotation of 3'utr sequences, and hence because of their different lengths, had not been identified earlier. after this filtering,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> intergenic regions remained clearly transcribed during the three developmental stages, respectively . some of these regions may reflect alternative start sites, extended 3'utrs, retrotransposed or pseudogene elements, as well as non-coding rnas.

we next asked whether these transcribed intergenic regions were distributed randomly throughout the genome or, alternatively, whether they would tend to be associated with  active  gene loci. we thus analyzed the transcriptional status of those genes located around each transcribed intergenic region, to assess whether they were themselves expressed or not . our genome-wide survey indicates that transcribed 'intergenic regions' are indeed found more frequently at the vicinity of transcribed genes, an observation valid as long as a distance of less than about  <dig> kb is considered. if a larger distance is allowed, this association becomes less significant . the same tendency was observed when we estimated the fraction of expressed, or non-expressed genes, with flanking transcribed intergenic regions . there again, a higher fraction of expressed genes, as compared to non-expressed, showed flanking intergenic transcription. in this case, interestingly, this correlation was increased when considering the sub-group of genes coding for transcription factors  and even non-expressed transcription factor-coding genes appeared to be more frequently surrounded by transcribed intergenic regions.

these results may reflect the presence, in the vicinity of annotated genes, of alternatively spliced regions, or alternate start sites, located at a distance, which had not been previously identified. it may also indicate that intergenic transcription may result from the nearby transcription of a 'standard' transcription unit, via a generic by-stander effect. for example, modifications of the epigenetic landscape associated with gene transcription may generate ectopic transcripts in the neighbourhood. in support of this, the fact that this observation is accentuated around transcription factors, i.e. nearby genes that, at least during development, are often controlled by remote regulations, over large distances  <cit> . we also measured the frequency of intergenic signals around those genes up-regulated between e <dig>  and e <dig> . however, the number of such genes with associated intergenic signals within a given distance was too low to be fully significant. the fact that transcription factor genes scored as 'not-expressed' showed an above-average occurrence of intergenic signal around them raises the possibility that these loci may maintain 'open' local chromosomal domains for subsequent activation, as proposed in the case of embryonic stem  cells based on the existence of a bivalent state in chromatin modifications  <cit> .

differentially expressed ncrnas
we searched for a differential expression of non-coding rnas  annotated in ucsc, between the three developmental stages. after careful  curation, which removed all potential 3'utrs, pseudogenes and non-coding isoforms of coding genes, we identified  <dig> long ncrnas that were differentially expressed in our samples . amongst them, ten were typical bidirectional transcripts, one was a cis-antisense transcript, two were antisense in the 3' end of genes , whereas the remaining ncrnas were not closely associated with any gene. twenty-two ncrnas increased their relative amounts at steady state levels, between e <dig>  and e <dig> , whereas eleven of them decreased in amount between e <dig>  and e <dig> . between e <dig>  and e <dig> , eleven ncrnas were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. as an example, the ncrna neat <dig> appeared as progressively up-regulated, consistent with the earlier observation that neat <dig> expression was re-enforced during muscle cell differentiation  <cit> . we also assessed the level of conservation of these transcripts  and found that they were globally poorly conserved in sequences amongst vertebrates, in agreement with the idea that the transcription itself of these rnas or their structure, rather than sequence conservation, may be important  <cit> .

'1' means that the lincrna is upregulated between the two stages considered, whereas '-1' indicated a down-regulation. the orientations with respect to the closest coding genes, as indicated, were not related to the distance between them. conservation scores  indicate mean values, as determined from the alignments of  <dig> vertebrate genomes with the mouse .

the expression of four long ncrnas was examined in some details by in situ hybridization , both to validate the transcriptome data and because these ncrnas are localised at the vicinity of genes known to be relevant for limb development. for instance, the important limb developmental regulator lmx1b gene is surrounded by several intergenic transcripts, in particular by a well-described bi-directional transcript along its promoter region . the hybridization pattern of this ncrna showed a nearly identical spatial distribution, in dorsal limb mesenchyme, and its expression dynamics closely matched that of lmx1b.  <dig> kb upstream of lmx1b, we found a differentially expressed transcript, which may as well be an alternative start site for this gene since it is transcribed from the same dna strand and expressed in an identical dorsal mesenchyme domain, even though it was more dramatically down-regulated at e <dig>  than lmx1b, as validated by qpcr. this example illustrates the difficulty to discriminate between genuine ncrnas and parts of known transcription units located nearby.

two bidirectional non-coding transcripts were also examined in some details by in situ hybridization, one starting very close from the start site of the hand <dig> gene, whereas the other one starts at approximately  <dig> kb from the prdm <dig> tss . here again, expression patterns were nearly identical between the ncrnas and their 'host' genes. both hand <dig> and the associated ncrna were expressed in a patch on the posterior side of the developing limb bud, whereas the prdm <dig> pair was transcribed strongly in distal autopod cells, in particular in growing digits. in both cases, it is thus likely that the transcription of these ncrnas was achieved by regulatory modules used to control the genes located nearby .

the fourth case selected as an example is at the sox <dig> locus. sox <dig> is a rather small gene, located on chromosome  <dig> and surrounded by large gene deserts, which display series of significant transcript signals during limb development. several such peaks were observed both in 5' of the gene, where they matched small bi-directional transcripts , and in 3' where up to more than  <dig> kb large unspliced ncrnas were scored . we focused our attention on a peak of transcriptional activity located approximately  <dig> kb downstream from the sox <dig> 3' utr and tested it by in situ hybridization . again, the expression pattern was globally that of sox <dig>  though with some differences, in particular in the developing major body axis. expression patterns in the limbs were similar to one another, suggesting once more that this ncrna was under the control of the regulations acting over sox <dig> 

ncrnas appear to be involved in diverse biological processes, as exemplified by the association of some lncrnas with gene silencing . our results indicate that these rna species are frequently coupled either to actively transcribed regions, or to enhancer regions controlling genes of importance for developmental processes  <cit> . accordingly, it is often unclear as to whether these transcripts result from a by-stander effect, i.e. by recruiting the activity of potent enhancer sequences located nearby, or if their control sequences evolved partly or entirely due to their own functional outcomes.

clustered genes and intergenic transcription
gene clusters usually comprise structurally and/or functionally related genes that may have arisen via ancestral gene duplication events. clustered genes often share some of their regulatory controls, either due to the existence of global regulatory modules controlling several genes at once, or because duplications also included some target sequences for upstream factors. on the other hand, gene duplication events certainly favored some functional divergence. for example, a duplication event generated the gdf10/gdf <dig> pair of transcription factors on chromosome 14; while gdf <dig> is differentially expressed in the developing limb , gdf <dig> is not expressed there. in contrast, both the zic <dig> and zic <dig> genes, also produced by a late duplication, are differentially expressed with the same dynamics , whereas the paralogous genes zic <dig> and zic <dig> were scored as non-expressed. another case is the iroquois gene family, with both the irx3/irx <dig> and irx1/irx <dig> pairs scored as being expressed, whereas the distal genes irx <dig> and irx <dig> were not detected. interestingly, in the cases of zic <dig>  irx <dig> and irx <dig>  promoter-associated bi-directional transcripts were also detected . other examples for clustered expression of transcription factors are the myf5/ <dig> muscle-specific genes  <cit> , which were up-regulated during differentiation, or the cbx2/8/ <dig> triplet, where cbx <dig> was down-regulated in older limb buds, whereas cbx <dig> and cbx <dig> were expressed steadily throughout the three stages.

the four hox gene clusters have been used as models for the coordinated regulation of expression in a variety of derivatives, including in developing limbs. in particular, the hoxa and hoxd clusters, which contain  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, have essential functions during both hind- and forelimb development  <cit> . in both gene clusters, we observed transcription profiles in agreement with published datasets, showing a global decrease in intensity in e <dig>  limb buds, mostly reflecting the cell type specialization of gene expression and hence a severe dilution effect when compared to the general expression in mesenchymal cells observed in e <dig> . extensive intergenic transcription was scored, whose expression profiles followed those of the surrounding hox genes . in the case of hoxd, three such intergenic regions encoded by the same strand as all hoxd genes were tested by in situ hybridization. they all showed expression patterns virtually identical to those of the closest hoxd genes, suggesting that they may be expanded 3' utrs . in the case of hoxa <dig>  a bi-directional transcript was also scored, yet its expression profile was not related to that of hoxa <dig>  recently, this transcript  was named hottip and shown to be involved in the regulation of hoxa cluster genes in cultured cells  <cit> .

finally, the largest gene clusters differentially expressed in developing limbs were associated with the skin developmental programs, including the keratin gene complexes on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  or the sprrb and s100a genes on chromosome  <dig>  with a dominant expression at e <dig> . these latter genes are part of the 'epidermal differentiation complex', spanning nearly  <dig> mb and composed of members of different gene families clustered together  <cit> ; .

imprinted gene clusters and associated ncrnas
more than  <dig> imprinted genes have been reported in the human genome, organized into distinct and large chromosomal regions http://www.har.mrc.ac.uk/research/genomic_imprinting/ <cit> . imprinted gene clusters usually involve genes unrelated in structure or function, and in many cases they contain one or more ncrnas that may regulate gene expression in cis  or in trans . a well-known example of a complex imprinted gene cluster is the dlk1-gtl <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig>  the whole gene array located on the positive dna strand seems to be up-regulated in limbs between day  <dig>  and  <dig> , with the most significant change observed for gtl <dig>  and the rian non-coding rnas . dio <dig>  lying at the very 3' end of the complex was silent . the mirna cluster, embedded within and in 5' outside the non-coding rna mirg, also gave a positive signal, suggesting they may be part of a larger transcript. amongst the gene members of the cluster, gtl <dig> was shown to be important during embryonic development  <cit> , as deletion of the maternal allele resulted in perinatal lethality and skeletal muscle defects  <cit> .

other imprinted genes relevant for limb and/or bone development were found expressed, including the gnas-nespas locus, important for cartilage development  <cit>  or cdkn1c, within the kcnq <dig> imprinted cluster  <cit> , as well as the igf2-h <dig> cluster, necessary for skeletal development and ossification  <cit> . plagl <dig> , a gene encoding a zinc-finger transcription factor, which regulates other imprinted genes and is also required for bone ossification  <cit> , was progressively up-regulated, indicating the potential importance of imprinted genes during limb development.

CONCLUSIONS
these datasets provide a valuable resource, either for research projects involving gene expression and regulation in developing mouse limbs, or as examples of tissue-specific, genome-wide transcriptional activities. more specifically, we found that expression signals are frequently confined to known transcript boundaries but tend to extend past the 3'ends of genes. also, about  <dig> percent of known genes were found expressed in limbs of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  days old foetuses. we observed extensive intronic transcription, since about  <dig> percent of expressed genes also contained signals covering intronic sequences. after filtering, more than  <dig>  intergenic regions remained clearly transcribed during the three developmental stages. finally, we identified  <dig> long ncrnas that were differentially expressed in our samples.
