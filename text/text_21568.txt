BACKGROUND
eggplant  is the third most agriculturally important crop from the genus solanum after potato   <cit>  and tomato   <cit> . this large and diverse genus of flowering plants comprises > <dig> species having a wide range of genetic and phenotypic variation  <cit> . in  <dig>   <dig>  million tons of eggplant was produced in the top four producing countries, namely china , india , egypt  and turkey , according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations . there are three closely related cultivated species of eggplant, all of old world origin: s. aethiopicum l. , s. macrocarpon l.  and s. melongena l.   <cit> . the brinjal or aubergine eggplant, hereafter referred to as eggplant, is cultivated worldwide and is an autogamous diploid with  <dig> chromosomes   <cit> . eggplant is susceptible to many bacterial and fungal pathogens and insects, such as the verticillium dahlia fungus and nematodes  <cit> , which cause significant yield losses. as such, improving resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses is one of the main objectives of eggplant breeding programs.

solanum torvum sw., commonly known as turkey berry, is a wild relative of eggplant and is found in tropical africa, asia and south america. turkey berry is widely consumed and is an important folk medicinal plant in tropical and subtropical countries  <cit> . more importantly, turkey berry is resistant to root-knot nematodes and the most serious soil-borne diseases, such as those caused by ralstonia solanacearum, v. dahlia klebahn and fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melongenae  <cit> , providing promising genetic resources for improvement of eggplant. traditional grafting techniques are now used worldwide in eggplant cultivation, in which eggplant tissues are grafted onto disease-resistant rootstock of turkey berry . also, attempts have been made to introduce turkey berry resistance into eggplant through conventional breeding and biotechnological techniques, however, progress is limited. owing to sexual incompatibilities, however, attempts at crossing eggplant with turkey berry have had limited success  <cit> , and sterile hybrids were obtained, with difficulty, only when eggplant was used as the female parent  <cit> . other biotechnological techniques, such as embryo rescue, somatic hybridization and agrobacterium-mediated transformation, have been difficult to apply to eggplant  <cit>  because of the limited genetic information available for this species.

solanum crops that belong to the potatoe clade, which includes potato and tomato, have been targets for comprehensive genomic studies  <cit> . however, genomic resources are lacking for the leptostemonum clade , which comprises almost one-third of the genus distributed worldwide  <cit>  and includes eggplant and turkey berry. for eggplant,  <dig>  nucleotide sequences have been deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  genbank database , and the vast majority of them  were provided recently by a comparative analysis of ests  <cit> . in that analysis, however, only  <dig>  unigenes were constructed, which is approximately half the number of genes identified in the closely related potato   <cit>  and tomato   <cit> , implying that these unigenes represent only a limited portion of the whole eggplant transcriptome. in addition, large numbers of short-read sequences have been generated from turkey berry in attempts to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats using restriction site–associated dna tag sequencing strategies; however, this approach provides only limited information on full-length genes, and such information is vital for identifying trait-related genes and for quantitative gene expression analysis. recent studies reported  <dig>  unigenes from s. torvum cultivar torubamubiga  <cit>  and  <dig>  unigenes from s. torvum sw. accession tg <dig> transcriptome assemblies  <cit> . in the latter study, however, sequencing was confined to the 3′ end of the transcripts, resulting in fragmentary assembled transcripts as revealed by an n <dig> value  of only 514 bp and an n <dig> value of only 715 bp. therefore, there is an urgent need to obtain more high-quality genomic information about eggplant and turkey berry, and a promising technology to accomplish this is rna sequencing .

high-quality transcriptome data would not only facilitate genetic and molecular breeding approaches in eggplant and allow genomic resource mining in turkey berry but also be valuable for comparative biology studies, such as phylogenomics. for example, rna-seq data have been used to explore the evolution of paleopolyploidy in plants  <cit>  and to reconstruct deep phylogenies in flowering plants of the grape family   <cit> . these studies suggest that transcriptome data can be very useful and practical in the reconstruction of phylogenies in flowering plants.

the specific goals of this study were to  generate high-quality transcripts and unigenes of eggplant and turkey berry using rna-seq, which will provide reference transcriptomes for further analysis, such as trait-related gene mining and quantitative expression analysis;  produce a dated phylogeny of the potatoe and leptostemonum clades and of the leptostemonum-nested eggplant  and turkey berry , which will deepen our understanding of phylogenetic relationships and ultimately assist crop improvement; and  identify and compare disease resistance genes in eggplant and turkey berry to take a first glance at the variation of resistance genes among them using rna-seq data.

RESULTS
de novo transcriptome assembly and annotation captures high-quality transcripts and unigenes
to maximize the range of transcript diversity and completeness, mixed rna samples from three tissues of each plant were prepared for illumina sequencing. we obtained  <dig>  gb and  <dig>  gb of sequence from eggplant and turkey berry respectively , and the raw paired-end data were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive. the cleaned reads were aligned to the genomes of the closely related solanum species tomato and potato to assess sequencing completeness. as shown in figure  <dig> , the depth distribution of eggplant and turkey berry fit well to the tomato gene distribution. similarly, the eggplant and turkey berry reads fit well with the potato gene distribution . these results indicate that the sequencing reads obtained from eggplant and turkey berry covered the majority of genes in these species.table  <dig>

clean reads from the two solanum species were then separately assembled into contigs and clustered into transcripts using the de novo transcriptome assembler trinity, which can efficiently reconstruct full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels and sequencing depths  <cit> . the clustering step substantially improved the assembly quality, as indicated by elevated n <dig> values and decreased total length, by eliminating redundant contigs . similar transcripts in the same cluster are thought to be isoforms  at the gene locus  <cit> . to further eliminate redundant transcripts and to obtain the primary representative of each gene locus, only the longest transcript in each cluster was regarded as the final assembled unigene. this process identified  <dig>  unigenes for eggplant and  <dig>  unigenes for turkey berry , which included  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes longer than 1 kb respectively. we observed a decrease in n <dig> values of unigenes compared with transcripts, suggesting that longer genes may tend to generate more isoforms. this hypothesis was confirmed by plotting unigene length against the average number of isoforms in each bin and performing a pearson's correlation coefficient test , which showed a significant positive correlation for both eggplant and turkey berry.figure  <dig>

to evaluate the completeness of our assemblies, the transcripts and unigenes were aligned with the tomato and potato sequences to obtain the corresponding reference genes, and then the unigene and transcript distributions were plotted against the tomato and potato reference genomes. the unigene and transcript distribution patterns were similar to the gene distribution patterns of both the tomato  and potato , indicating the completeness of the unigene assemblies.

our assemblies were of substantially higher quality than those generated in previous studies  <cit> . in a comparative analysis of eggplant ests  <cit> , only  <dig>  unigenes were constructed, which is less than half of our  <dig>  unigenes and of the genes identified in the closely related potato   <cit>  and tomato   <cit> . global transcriptome profiling aimed at gaining insight into the mechanisms underpinning turkey berry resistance against meloidogyne incognita <cit>  produced  <dig>  unigenes from s. torvum sw. accession tg <dig>  although this number is comparable to our results, to improve coverage and conserve specificity, sequencing in that study was confined to the 3′ end of the transcripts, resulting in a fragmented assembly, as indicated by low n <dig>  and n <dig>  values. without introduced bias, our n <dig> value was  <dig>  bp, which is similar to the n <dig> of the non-redundant coding sequences  from tomato  and potato . taken together, these results suggest that the quality and completeness of our sequencing and assembly were high enough for annotation and further analyses.

annotation provides important information on gene function and structure. we were able to annotate  <dig> %  of the eggplant unigenes and  <dig> %  of the turkey berry unigenes with a threshold of 1e– <dig> by performing a blastx search against diverse protein databases. when we extracted and aligned the putative cdss,  <dig> %  of eggplant unigenes and  <dig> %  of turkey berry were annotated . these results further confirmed the high quality of the de novo assembly.table  <dig>

in a blastx homolog search against the ncbi non-redundant  protein database,  <dig>  eggplant unigenes and  <dig>  turkey berry unigenes had matches ,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, of which showed >80% identity , indicating the high accuracy of the assembly. for both species, the top hit species was tomato, followed by potato and then grape  . interestingly, only  <dig> % of the top hits were assigned to potato, which is much less than the  <dig> % of eggplant and  <dig> % of turkey berry hits that were assigned to tomato. a similar result was observed in an est-based comparative analysis of eggplant  <cit> , suggesting that these two species are more closely related to tomato than potato.figure  <dig>

comparative analysis of gene sets between plants
a total of  <dig>  proteins from eggplant , turkey berry  and  <dig> other plant species, including tomato, potato, arabidopsis thaliana, carica papaya, v. vinifera, prunus persica, citrus sinensis, medicago truncatula, zea mays and oryza sativa japonica, were binned into  <dig>  orthologous groups  using orthomcl v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  following self-self-comparison with the blastp program. the average number of genes in each gene family , the number of unique gene families , and number of genes in the unique gene families  of eggplant and turkey berry were less than those of tomato, potato and other plants. this suggests that either eggplant and turkey berry have distinct gene family features or that our gene sets are incomplete. although our rna libraries were derived from mixed tissue samples, it is likely that not all genes in the genome are represented in our transcriptomes.table  <dig>

nevertheless,  <dig>  orthologous groups were shared by all  <dig> species , which is comparable to previous studies. wang et al. <cit>  found  <dig>  shared core orthologous groups between gossypium raimondii, theobroma cacao, a. thaliana and z. mays, d’hont et al. <cit>  found  <dig>  shared gene families between musa acuminata, phoenix dactylifera, a. thaliana, o. sativa, sorghum bicolor and brachypodium distachyon, and peng et al.  <cit>  found  <dig>  shared gene families among five grass genomes. the numbers of orthologous groups that we observed were smaller, but the groups included more species, which may indicate that our analysis was more stringent and therefore may represent only highly conserved orthologous groups among dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. among the  <dig>  core orthologous groups,  <dig> contained only one ortholog in each species . these groups were suitable for inferring phylogenetic relationships and for estimating divergence time.

inferring phylogenetic relationships
to maximize the information content of our sequences and minimize the impact of missing data, the  <dig> single-copy orthologous groups were further filtered with stricter constraints on length  and sequence alignment , and the resultant  <dig> groups were used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.

the cds alignments from the  <dig> refined single-copy orthologous groups were first concatenated to form one supergene for each species, each of which was then subjected to phylogenetic analyses with the maximum likelihood method in phyml <dig>   <cit> . unexpectedly, the phylogenies obtained  were incongruent with the well-recognized angiosperm phylogeny group iii  system  <cit> . notably, the branch lengths  varied considerably in our tree, indicating relatively variable evolution rates among species. quite different substitution rates are commonly observed for the three positions within codons, with the third position being especially variable as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code. third-position substitutions are likely to be saturated and may accumulate mutational bias, which may influence the accuracy of phylogeny estimations  <cit> . therefore, the cds alignments of each of the  <dig> gene families were separated into three datasets corresponding to each of the three codon positions in the cds, and another three supergenes were assembled and used to estimate phylogeny. as predicted, the three maximum likelihood trees were identical  and placed the monocot, asterids, grape and eurosids clades in accordance with the apg iii system. notably, all the clades leading to asterid species had 100% bootstrap support values, even in the uncorrected tree , implying that the rna-seq assemblies may not be responsible for the incongruence of phylogenies that we observed when using full-length cds sequences and also providing robust support for the known relationships in asterid species. as shown in figure  <dig>  eggplant was most closely related to its leptostemonum clade relative turkey berry, and further separated from the members of the potatoe clade, tomato and potato  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
maximum likelihood unrooted tree based on the second-codon positions of  <dig> single-copy genes. all of the nodes have 100% bootstrap support values except the node marked with the red dot, which has a bootstrap value of 88%.



estimation of divergence time
the three codon position–based supergene sets from the  <dig> single-copy orthologous groups were used for combination analysis of multi-partitions in the mcmctree program   <cit> . the same substitution model was used, but different parameters were assigned and estimated for each set. moreover, because of the variable evolution rate among species we observed, the clock model with independent rates among lineages specified by a log-normal probability distribution was adopted  <cit> . to check the robustness of results, we ran the mcmctree analysis twice and obtained similar results, and a chronogram  was produced using figtree v <dig> . <dig>  from the first run. another dataset containing only the first two supergene sets  was subjected to mcmctree analysis, and a similar chronogram was obtained .figure  <dig>

all of the geological times estimated for nodes leading to non-asterid species were well matched to data deposited in timetree  <cit> , a public knowledge-base of divergence times among organisms, demonstrating the high reliability of this molecular clock dating strategy. as shown in figure  <dig>  the divergence between eggplant and turkey berry appears to have occurred ~ <dig>   million years ago , during the late miocene. the leptostemonum and potatoe clades shared a common ancestor during the middle miocene and appear to have diverged ~ <dig>   mya, which is in agreement with the  <dig> – <dig>  mya estimated by wang et al. <cit> . a whole-genome triplication in tomato  <cit>  and potato  <cit>  has been estimated at  <dig>  mya on the basis of synonymous substitutions of paralogous genes, which is much earlier than the splitting of leptostemonum and potatoe clades. this timeline implies, therefore, that both eggplant and turkey berry underwent genome triplication, but this remains to be verified by complete genome sequences.

disease resistance genes
a fundamental strategy for controlling diseases in agriculturally important plants is the isolation of resistance genes from their less susceptible relatives to be used in conventional breeding, genetic engineering and biotechnological approaches  <cit> . because of limited genetic resources for eggplant and turkey berry, however, only one resistance gene, a ve-like gene , has been identified in these species, to our knowledge  <cit> . moreover, a large number of plant resistance genes have been identified and deposited in the plant resistance genes database   <cit> . of these entries,  <dig> were manually curated to confirm that they were described in the literature to confer resistance to pathogens, and they are grouped into seven distinct classes based on the presence of specific domains or partial domains  <cit> : n-terminal coiled coil–nucleotide-binding site–leucine-rich repeat , toll interleukin <dig> receptor–nucleotide-binding site–leucine-rich repeat , receptor-like kinase , receptor-like protein , three truncated classes  and ‘other’ which has no typical resistance related domains. of the  <dig> entries,  <dig>  are from solanaceae,  <dig>  are from poaceae,  <dig>  are from brassicaceae, and only  <dig>  are from other families. the high percentage of closely related sequences  and outgroup sequences  made it possible to identify and classify both recently arisen and ancient orthologous resistance genes through homology-based approaches.

amino acid sequences for the  <dig> reference resistance genes were downloaded from the prgdb  <cit>  and used to identify and classify putative resistance genes in arabidopsis, eggplant, turkey berry, tomato and potato , and the resistance gene distributions were plotted . this conservative approach revealed  <dig> resistance genes in arabidopsis, including  <dig> cnl and  <dig> tnl class genes, which is comparable to results from domain prediction–based methods  <cit>  in which  <dig> cnl and  <dig> tnl class genes were identified.table  <dig>

compared with arabidopsis, each of the four solanum species contained approximately twice the number of resistance genes, with  <dig> in eggplant,  <dig> in turkey berry,  <dig> in tomato, and  <dig> in potato. the wide intraspecific variation in number of resistance genes may underlie the species-specific differences in resistance to different types and quantities of pathogens and differences in the degree of responses to the same pathogen. the different resistance capability between eggplant and turkey berry may partly result from variation in the number of resistance genes, as turkey berry carries nearly  <dig> more resistance genes than eggplant. resistance genes are frequently clustered in the genome—the result of both segmental and tandem duplications  <cit> —and this was also observed in tomato  and potato . resistance genes also appeared to be clustered in eggplant  and turkey berry , but this observation needs verification with genome data.

another difference between the solanum species and arabidopsis was the composition of resistance gene classes. tnl genes outnumbered cnl genes in the four solanum species, which is similar to what has been observed in both grape and poplar  but in contrast to what has been found in apple , soybean  and arabidopsis  <cit> . the cnl and tnl classes are the two major nl proteins, which are believed to act intracellularly  <cit> , and the rlk and rlp classes are the two major membrane-localized receptor proteins that sense various pathogens and transduce signals to downstream intra- and intercellular networks  <cit> . the numbers of genes of all of these four classes were larger in turkey berry than in eggplant . this may reflect amplification of the entire disease resistance pathway in turkey berry rather than duplication of a particular gene or class of genes to enhance pathogen defense and consequently improve fitness. the variation in the number of resistance genes was also evidenced by plotting the distribution of eggplant and turkey berry resistance genes against the tomato genome . as shown in figure  <dig>  the distribution patterns were similar  overall, but numbers of genes varied.

CONCLUSIONS
our results deepen our understanding of phylogenetic relationships, which will ultimately assist in eggplant improvement efforts. furthermore, these high-quality unigenes will be useful in trait-related gene mining, as we demonstrated with the identification of plant resistance genes and comparison of these genes between species. results from resistance genes identification indicated the high variation of resistance genes between them. in addition, these datasets can serve as reference transcriptomes for further analyses, such as quantitative gene expression profiling, to broaden our understanding of eggplant biology and to improve this agriculturally important vegetable.
