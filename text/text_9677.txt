BACKGROUND
esophageal cancer is one of the leading causes of death from cancers worldwide. the two major histotypes of esophageal cancer are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  and barrett's adenocarcinoma   <cit> .

several specific molecular alterations play crucial roles in the carcinogenesis of escc or bac, with tumor cell aneuploidy and p <dig> mutations being major hallmarks of both escc and bac  <cit> . in fact, aneuploidy is found in 50% to 70% of escc and is associated with poor prognosis  <cit> . in bac, similar high rates of aneuploidy are seen for invasive carcinomas  <cit> , and aneuploidy is an early event in the metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence of bac. moreover, p <dig> is mutated in 35% to 80% of escc and in about 50% to 90% of bac  <cit> .

together with deregulation of mitotic and post-mitotic cell cycle control points, the presence of supernumerary centrosomes has been proposed as one likely mechanism for development and/or maintenance of aneuploidy  <cit> . supernumerary centrosomes have been detected in several aneuploid human cancers or cell lines derived thereof by evaluation of centrosomal proteins, such as γ-tubulin, pericentrin or inhibitor of dna binding protein  <dig>   <cit> . however, the association of supernumerary centrosomes with multipolar mitoses in aneuploid escc and bac cells has not been studied so far.

the aurora kinase family of serine/threonine kinases regulates many processes during cell division and is currently discussed as therapeutic target in cancer  <cit> . specifically, aurora-a is important for centrosome maturation, separation and spindle assembly  <cit> . amplification of the aurora-a locus  and subsequent overexpression of aurora-a was observed for example in colorectal  <cit>  and pancreatic cancer  <cit> , as well as in esccs and bacs  <cit> . overexpression of aurora-a has been functionally associated with supernumerary centrosomes and aneuploidy  <cit> . in esophageal cancers, a polymorphism of aurora-a was associated with increased esophageal cancer risk. this aurora-a polymorphism showed reduced aurora-a kinase activity, lack of phosphorylation of its substrate lats <dig> and associated genetic instability, at least by ectopic expression of the aurora-a isoforms in immortalized fibroblasts  <cit> . whether or not lack of lats <dig> phosphorylation alone and/or other alterations of the aurora-a isoforms, such as incorrect intracellular localization, are responsible for genomic instability in esophageal cancer cells remained elusive.

in contrast, aurora-b is involved in kinetochore-microtubule interactions, chromosome condensation and cytokinesis  <cit> . together with incenp, survivin and borealin, aurora-b builds the chromosomal passenger complex  <cit> . the aurora-b gene  is located in the chromosomal region 17p <dig>   <cit> , which is also frequently altered in esccs and bacs  <cit> . although the role of aurora-b in human cancer is less clear than for aurora-a, an association between aurora-b overexpression and aneuploidy has been reported for some cancer cell lines  <cit> . however, in esophageal cancer the association of aurora-a and aurora-b with occurrence of multipolar mitoses in aneuploid escc or bac cells remains elusive so far.

in view of the crucial role of the tumor suppressor p <dig> for maintenance of genetic stability  <cit>  and its frequent mutation in esophageal cancer  <cit> , it is of interest that also a centrosomal localization and functional involvement in centrosome duplication has been described for p <dig>  <cit> . moreover, p <dig> can be phosphorylated by aurora-a, leading to mdm <dig> dependent p <dig> inactivation and degradation and/or loss of p <dig> transactivation activity  <cit> . together,  disruption of p <dig> function may result in escape of the p <dig> dependent g <dig> post-mitotic checkpoint  <cit>  and potentially also centrosomal dysfunction.

the aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of multipolar mitoses and association with aurora kinases and p <dig> mutations in previously established esophageal carcinoma cell lines  <cit>  and control esophageal epithelial cells  <cit> .

RESULTS
ploidy and cell cycle distribution in normal esophageal epithelial cells and esophageal cancer cells
for the present study, a control diploid cell line derived from normal esophageal epithelial cells  <cit>  as well as four aneuploid esophageal cancer cell lines with squamous cell  and adenocarcinoma  differentiation and growth patterns  <cit> , i.e. closely reflecting the morphological features of the two main histotypes of esophageal cancer, were used. all experimental data shown are derived from each three independent experiments.

ploidy, respective dna content, as well as cell cycle distribution patterns of all five cell lines was first defined by flow cytometry. this validated diploidy of epc-htert cells and aneuploidy to different levels in the esophageal cancer cell lines . to further define chromosome numbers in the aneuploid esophageal cancer cell lines, each  <dig> metaphase spreads were analyzed and revealed highest chromosome numbers in oe <dig> , followed by kyse- <dig> , oe <dig>  and oe <dig>  cells. analyses of cell cycle distribution  revealed that escc cells  showed similarly distributed cell populations in g0/g1-, s- and g2/m-phases . in contrast, oe <dig>  and markedly oe <dig>  and epc-htert  cells had a high g0/g1-phase population, with reduced s- and g2/m-phase populations.

aurora kinases in normal esophageal epithelial cells and esophageal cancer cells
for aurora-a , fluorescence in situ hybridization  revealed chromosome  <dig> polysomy with concomitantly elevated aurora-a gene copy numbers in oe <dig>  oe <dig> and oe <dig> cells and an aurora-a gene amplification with up to nine aurora-a gene copies in kyse- <dig> cells. in view of their aurora-a gene amplification, kyse- <dig> cells also showed highest aurora-a mrna  and high protein  expression. in contrast, oe <dig>  oe <dig> and oe <dig> cells exhibited lower aurora-a mrna expression, despite chromosome  <dig> polysomy. still, high aurora-a protein expression was seen in oe <dig>  but not oe <dig> and oe <dig> cells. active  aurora-a was hardly detectable in immunoblot analysis, but weak aurora-a/phosphot <dig> levels were seen in oe <dig>  kyse- <dig> and oe <dig> cells. control epc-htert cells had normal diploid aurora-a gene copy numbers, lowest aurora-a mrna expression, but detectable strong aurora-a and weak aurora-a/phosphot <dig> protein levels.

the table summarizes results of fish analyses of control esophageal epithelial cells  and all four esophageal cancer cell lines, with mean and ± standard deviation of gene specific  and centromere  specific fish signals as well as the amplification status .

for aurora-b , chromosome  <dig> polysomy and concomitantly elevated aurora-b gene copy numbers were observed by fish in the escc cell lines oe <dig> and kyse- <dig>  interestingly, in the bac cell lines oe <dig> and oe <dig> elevated chromosome  <dig> specific signals with lower aurora-b gene specific signals, resulting in aurora-b to chromosome  <dig> ratios below  <dig>  were observed. accordingly, both escc  cell lines had slightly higher aurora-b mrna and protein expression than the bac cell lines . active  aurora-b was apparent in oe <dig>  kyse- <dig> and oe <dig> cells. control epc-htert cells had normal diploid aurora-b gene copy numbers, similar aurora-b mrna as bac cell lines, but undetectable aurora-b protein expression or activity.

the low aurora-b gene copy numbers and protein expression in the two bac cell lines were not due to a general phenomenon of entire chromosome  <dig> alterations, since  her <dig> gene copy numbers  were highly amplified in these two cell lines .

thus, aurora-a and -b gene copy numbers are linked to mrna expression patterns, but this is not directly translated into altered protein or activity levels. whilst high aurora-a and aurora-b protein levels largely reflect dna copy numbers as well as cell cycle distribution in some cell lines , decoupling of aurora-a and/or -b gene copy numbers with expression and cell cycle distribution occurs in other cell lines .

high aurora-a expression alone is not associated with occurrence of multipolar mitoses in esophageal cancer cells
aurora-a gene amplification and protein overexpression have been linked to the occurrence of supernumerary centrosomes, formation of multipolar mitoses and aneuploidy  <cit> . we therefore next examined the occurrence of aurora-a positive multipolar mitoses in the epc-htert as well as the four esophageal cancer cell lines. for this, three independent experiments were performed by quantitative, aurora-a specific, indirect immunofluorescence  <cit>  with asynchronized cells, to detect occurrence of mitoses and multipolar mitoses in view of their own cell cycle dynamics . parallel hematoxylin and eosin  staining confirmed the data on mitotic cells morphologically and pericentrin-specific indirect immunofluorescence  <cit>  confirmed the presence of aurora-a associated supernumerary centrosomes.

 summary of the evaluation of the mitotic index. in three independent experiments, about  <dig> cells were counted and the number of mitoses therein was determined after aurora-a immunofluorescence staining. the table also provides mean and ± standard deviation of the percentage of mitoses.  summary of the evaluation of the index of multipolar mitoses. in three independent experiments, about  <dig> mitoses were counted and the number of multipolar mitoses therein was determined after aurora-a immunofluorescence staining. the table also provides mean and ± standard deviation of the percentage of multipolar mitoses.

to specify the previous flow cytometric analyses , which only provided data on the total number of g2/m-phase cells, the mitotic index  was evaluated in indirect immunofluorescence analysis of aurora-a and nuclear  staining. for each cell line at least  <dig> cells were counted in three independent experiments . this revealed the highest mitotic index in oe <dig> , followed by oe <dig> , oe <dig> , kyse- <dig>  and epc-htert  cells.

similarly, the occurrence of multipolar mitoses  was assessed by quantifying indirect immunofluorescence analysis of aurora-a and nuclear  stainings. for this, in each cell line at least  <dig> mitoses were counted in three independent experiments . aurora-a positive multipolar mitoses were most frequent in oe <dig>  followed by oe <dig>  and kyse- <dig>  cells. oe <dig> cells  as well as epc-htert cells , if any, only had single aurora-a positive multipolar mitoses. presence of supernumerary centrosomes in these multipolar mitoses was confirmed by pericentrin staining .

these data suggest that similarly high aurora-a expression  alone is insufficient to induce prominent multipolar mitoses in aneuploid esophageal cancer cells.

distinct p <dig> mutations contribute to multipolar mitoses in esophageal cancer cells
in view of the role of p <dig> in post-mitotic cell cycle control, centrosome duplication and aurora-a interaction  <cit>  as well as its frequent mutation in esophageal carcinogenesis  <cit> , we next determined p <dig> mutation status  <cit> , p <dig> protein expression and intracellular localization  <cit>  in the control epc-htert cell line and in the four esophageal cancer cell lines .

the control epc-htert cells exhibited a wild type p <dig> sequence and showed weak p <dig> protein expression in immunoblot  and indirect immunofluorescence analysis . this wild type p <dig> protein was located in the cytoplasm of epc-htert cells.

in contrast, all escc and bac cell lines displayed p <dig> mutations : oe <dig> cells exhibited p <dig> mutations in exon  <dig> , which introduce a stop codon at the n-terminus of the p <dig> core domain. the p <dig> protein of oe <dig> cells lacks almost the entire dna binding domain, the tetramerization domain and the extreme c-terminus . this protein, if at all being expressed, is most likely non-functional since almost all domains are missing, including the aurora-a interaction sites serine  <dig> and  <dig>  indeed, immunoblot analysis did not detect this largely truncated p <dig> protein  and immunofluorescence showed only weak and rather diffusely localized p <dig> staining in oe <dig> cells .

kyse- <dig> cells displayed a point mutation in exon  <dig>  of the tetramerization domain . this mutation was neither found in the original human cancer, of which this cell line was derived from, nor in the original kyse- <dig> cell line  <cit> . however, it was later reported in kyse- <dig> cells  <cit> . there are conflicting reports about whether this mutated p <dig> protein forms tetramers, binds dna, induces apoptosis and transactivates target genes or not. it seems that p <dig> with this mutation is partially functional depending on the experimental conditions  <cit> . in our case, this mutated p <dig> protein was clearly detectable in immunoblot analysis  and displayed a strong nuclear staining in most, but not all kyse- <dig> cells by indirect immunofluorescence .

oe <dig> cells had a point mutation in exon  <dig> , which is consistent with previous reports  <cit>  . this mutation abolishes the p <dig> transactivation activity as well as growth suppressive activity of the mutated protein and has a dominant negative effect on wild type p <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, this mutated p <dig> protein was still expressed and accumulated in oe <dig> cell nuclei, although in some cells to a weaker extent .

oe <dig> cells exhibited a mutation in exon  <dig> , which is in accordance with mutation databases  <cit> . this mutation is within the flexible linker, which connects the p <dig> core domain with the tetramerization domain, causes a stop codon within the tetramerization domain  and most likely inactivates p <dig> oligomerization . however, the latter is insufficient to fully abolish p <dig> tumor suppressive function and p <dig> monomer mutants with retention of transcriptional activity have been described  <cit> . in oe <dig> cells, this potentially still functional mutated p <dig> protein was strongly expressed as truncated protein at  <dig> kda in immunoblot analysis  and clearly accumulated in oe <dig> cell nuclei .

thus, loss of function p <dig> mutations may result in escape of post-mitotic g <dig> cell cycle control and possibly also centrosomal dysfunction  <cit>  in some , but not all  esophageal cancer cells.

discussion
this study addressed aurora kinases a and b, p <dig> mutations and occurrence of multipolar mitoses in aneuploid esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  and barrett's adenocarcinoma  cell lines .

quantitative data of each three independent experiments are summarized for fish and q-rt-pcr  analyses as well as for mitoses and multipolar mitoses . immunoblot analyses are depicted with minus  to increasingly positive  protein expression. identified p <dig> mutations and associated effects are listed.

amplification of 20q <dig> and/or aurora-a has been reported to occur frequently in human esophageal carcinomas by extract-based methods, such as  comparative genomic hybridization  <cit> . the present study confirms the importance of this chromosomal region in escc and bac, but our precise single cell fish analyses of each two escc and bac cell lines suggests that high level aurora-a gene amplification is a rather rare event in esophageal cancer cells. a clear-cut aurora-a gene amplification was only seen in kyse- <dig> cells, as described before  <cit> , whilst all other investigated cell lines had increased aurora-a gene copy numbers due to chromosome  <dig> polysomy. moreover, elevated aurora-a gene copy numbers may not necessarily result in elevated aurora-a mrna and/or protein expression, as exemplified by our results of oe <dig> and oe <dig> cells. also, aurora-a gene copy numbers are far from a direct link to activated aurora-a  protein levels. whilst cell cycle dynamics of esophageal cancer cells clearly impact detection levels of aurora-a expression, additional regulation of aurora-a expression by transcriptional, for example via epidermal growth factor receptor  <cit> , and post-translational, for example via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit> , mechanisms may further act in individual esophageal cancer cells. indeed, the clinical relevance of aurora-a in esophageal cancers has mainly been determined at the expression level  <cit> .

in contrast to aurora-a, there was a more close association between aurora-b gene copy numbers and aurora-b mrna and protein expression in the escc and bac cell lines. both escc cell lines  had elevated aurora-b gene copy numbers due to chromosome  <dig> polysomy and concomitant high aurora-b expression, but not activation . instead, both bac cell lines  displayed lower aurora-b gene specific signals than chromosome  <dig> specific signals with concomitantly low aurora-b mrna as well as protein expression and activity. in fact, also our previous studies showed broad chromosomal deletions on 17p close to the aurora-b locus in up to 40% of tissue specimens of bacs  <cit> , whilst other investigators reported controversial results for chromosome 17p alterations in tissue specimens of escc  <cit> . in order to rule out that this is due to a major chromosome  <dig> alteration, we performed fish and immunoblot analysis for her <dig> , clearly demonstrating that her <dig> is highly amplified in these two bac cell lines. this suggests that the detected genomic alteration is specific to 17p, respective potentially the aurora-b gene. the apparently "reduced" aurora-b gene copy numbers in bac cells may be due to a partial deletion, loss of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> or even duplication of centromere  <dig> alone. it will be of interest for future studies to investigate potentially deregulated chromosome integrity, for example by telomere alterations or breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, during mitosis of bac cells.

irrespective of this, the present results allow further insights into the direct association of high aurora-a expression with supernumerary centrosomes and the associated occurrence of multipolar mitoses and aneuploidy described in other model systems  <cit>  now also for aneuploid esophageal cancer cells. for example, ectopic overexpression of functional aurora-a in diploid colorectal cancer cell line  <cit>  or ectopic expression of kinase deficient aurora-a isoforms, which is unable to phosphorylate its substrate lats <dig>  in immortalized fibroblasts  <cit>  both resulted in either supernumerary centrosomes, chromosome segregation defects and/or genomic instability.

in fact, we found that high aurora-a expression in aneuploid escc or bac cells does not determine the occurrence of multipolar mitoses alone: 1) although exhibiting similarly high aurora-a expression, only oe <dig> cells, but not kyse- <dig> cells were characterized by a high frequency of multipolar mitoses and 2) of the two cell lines with markedly lower aurora-a expression , oe <dig> cells did in fact show a noticeable frequency of multipolar mitoses, being higher than in strongly aurora-a expressing kyse- <dig> cells.

thus, other factors are required to sustain cycling of multipolar mitotic esophageal cancer cells in order to allow development and maintenance of individual aneuploid escc and bac cell clones. since up to 80% of escc and 90% of bac display mutations of p <dig>  <cit> , this tumor suppressor protein is a very likely contributing factor, particularly in view of its role in g <dig> cell cycle and dna damage control, its centrosomal function  <cit>  as well as its inactivation and/or degradation upon interaction with aurora-a  <cit> . thus, cells with still intact or only partial dysfunctional p <dig> protein may still have p <dig> dependent g <dig> cell cycle control, a scenario that was of interest for the present data, particularly for the escc kyse- <dig> cells.

in the present study, p <dig> mutations were found in the four representative esophageal cancer cell lines, but in different domains and therefore with different consequences for protein expression and/or function. none of the p <dig> mutations detected corresponded to known p <dig> gain of function mutations  <cit> . instead, oe <dig> cells had p <dig> mutations , which caused weak expression of a presumably non-functional, largely truncated  p <dig> protein. also oe <dig> cells had a p <dig> mutation  resulting in a non-functional, nuclear accumulated p <dig> protein, lacking transactivation and growth suppressive activity  <cit> . in contrast, kyse- <dig> cells had a cell culture acquired  <cit>  p <dig> mutation , resulting in expression and nuclear accumulation of an at least partially functional p <dig> protein  <cit> . similarly, the p <dig> mutation confirmed in oe <dig> cells   <cit> , may cause expression of a truncated , but still partially functional p <dig> protein with lost oligomerization activity  <cit> . thus, esophageal cancer cells with both high aurora-a expression and p <dig> loss of function mutations have a high occurrence of multipolar mitoses . in contrast, esophageal cancer cells with aurora-a gene amplification and high aurora-a expression, but an at least partially functional p <dig> protein have fewer multipolar mitoses .

in contrast to the esophageal cancer cells, the normal esophageal epithelial cell line epc-htert  <cit>  was diploid, had wild type p <dig> and did show normal aurora-a and aurora-b gene copy numbers as well as bipolar mitoses. still, slightly elevated aurora-a and p <dig> protein levels were observed in this cell line. although no effect of htert was seen on p <dig> and p <dig> protein levels in the initial description of this cell line  <cit> , others have reported an effect of htert-induced downregulation of p <dig>  p <dig> and up-regulation of aurora-a in normal esophageal epithelial cells  <cit> , which may explain the detectable aurora-a protein expression observed in our experiments of epc-htert cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, high aurora-a expression together with p <dig> mutations may contribute to aneuploid esophageal cancer cells via supernumerary centrosomes and associated occurrence of multipolar mitoses. this is heterogeneous in single escc or bac cell lines, thereby reflecting the heterogeneity also observed in individual patients with escc or bac  <cit> . the study therefore represents a basis for further translational assessment of aurora kinases and associated cell cycle control in aneuploid escc and bac cells, particularly also in view of discussions of aurora kinases as therapeutic targets  <cit> . further assessment of aurora kinases and p <dig> interactions in cell lines or tissue specimens derived from precursor lesions of dysplasia  or intestinal metaplasia  are necessary to disclose a causative role of aurora kinases and p <dig> in the development of aneuploid, invasive esophageal cancers.
