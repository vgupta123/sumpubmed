BACKGROUND
the explosion of systems biology in recent years, facilitated by sequencing of the human genome  <cit>  and the development of high throughput methods to rapidly characterise and quantify biological systems  <cit> , has promoted understanding of complex biological and pathological processes. gene regulatory networks  represent a systems biology approach, taking advantage of the growing number of rna abundance data sets generated by modern high throughput methods such as microarrays or rnaseq, to holistically model interactions between molecules in cells and tissues. grn are usually displayed as directed graphs - nodes represent mrna abundance and edges represent some form of regulatory relationship between the nodes. the reverse engineering of grn from gene expression data has been used to understand molecular interactions in both bacterial and lower eukaryotic organisms, as well as in more complex mammalian systems. grn employ simple correlation  <cit>  or boolean  <cit>  methods, algorithms based on mutual information  <cit>  as well as bayesian methods. computational frameworks have been generated to simultaneously perform several types of grn analysis  <cit> . bayesian grn are in theory especially powerful for inference of causal relationships between mrnas in noisy microarray data  <cit> . in bayesian grn, the probability of the abundance of each mrna node is modelled using a function that takes as its inputs the abundance of the node's parent mrnas. the edges in a bayesian grn can represent hidden protein, non-coding rna or metabolite-based regulatory relationships  <cit> . therefore, bayesian grn can in theory capture information about a subset of the complex cellular regulatory circuitry  <cit> . many grn developed to date have had a ‘scale free’ structure  <cit> , in which a small number of “hub” rnas can be identified that are connected to large numbers of downstream rnas in the networks. these hub rnas are candidate master-regulators of transcription and other cellular processes. their identification is based on relationships in the data between the hub rna and their downstream rnas in the grn structure, which are usually referred to as "children". therefore, the amount of data behind the identification of hub rnas is much greater than the amount of data behind the identification of individual edges, and correct identification of hubs may be easier in theory than the correct identification of individual edges.

apoptosis is pivotal for normal ec function  <cit> , and the dysregulation of endothelial apoptosis is a key step in the development of numerous pathologies  <cit> , including cardiovascular disease  <cit>  and tumourogenesis  <cit> . understanding the regulatory events occurring during this process in a holistic manner may provide insight into normal vascular development and maintenance, as well as vascular pathologies. although there has been extensive characterisation of the ec proteins involved in apoptotic pathways  <cit> , there have been fewer investigations into regulation of the transcriptome in ecs undergoing apoptosis  <cit> .

to begin to address this issue, our group have previously used bayesian grn to identify molecular interactions involved in survival factor deprivation -induced ec apoptosis and cell cycle arrest  <cit> . this previous study used micorarray data over a triplicated eight time point sfd time course. previous studies have illustrated the value of supplementing time series data with gene disruption data . since at the time we were especially interested in regulation of the cell cycle, in this previous work the time series data was supplemented by eight microarrays from ec cultures treated with sirnas targeting molecules associated with the cell cycle. this analysis identified several grn master regulator rnas including the γ-amino butyric acid -receptor associated protein   <cit> .

in theory, the greater the volume of high-quality sirna data used to supplement time course data, and the broader the range of rnas targeted by the sirnas, the more likely it is that accurate predictions can be made by grn. therefore, in this current study we have expanded our previous analysis by combining triplicated eight time point sfd time course data with a much larger library of ec sirna disruptant microarray data, which was generated from the knockdown of  <dig> different mrna transcripts that encode proteins with a broad range of functions in ec  <cit> . this expanded analysis identified numerous grn master regulators, many of which were already known to play important roles in ec biology. however, we noted one major master regulator rna named vasohibin- <dig>  that had not at the time been extensively studied in ec apoptosis. therefore, we investigated the function of vash <dig> in regulating mrna abundance and in the process of ec apoptosis. we targeted vash <dig> using sirna and then used quantitative polymerase chain reaction  to examine the abundance of  <dig> of the  <dig> mrnas directly downstream of vash <dig> in the grn.  <dig> of these  <dig> mrnas were significantly up- or down-regulated in the direction predicted by the grn when vash <dig> expression was reduced. we also show that vash <dig> is required for the apoptotic response in ec treated with sfd.

methods
cell culture and sirna transfection
umbilical cords were collected with written informed maternal consent and the approval of the cambridge  research ethics committee. human umbilical vein ecs  were isolated by collagenase digestion, as previously described  <cit> . cells were cultured in fully supplemented media without antibiotics  lonza, cambridge, uk), at 37°c/5% co <dig>  to carry out sirna transfection, huvec pools consisting of  <dig> biological isolates  were prepared using passage  <dig> cultured cells. the huvec pools were plated in 6-well plates at  <dig>  ×  <dig> per well and left for 24hrs until approximately 70% confluent. sirna transfection was carried out using pools of four sirna duplexes from dharmacon inc  and the sifectamine transfection reagent  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

rna processing and microarray preparation
rna was extracted using trizol® reagent . rna quality was assessed using the agilent  <dig> bioanalyser. biotin labelled crna was generated and hybridised on the codelink human uniset 20k microarrays following the manufacturer’s instructions .

quantitative pcr
cdna was synthesised from 1μg of total rna using the quantitect reverse transcription kit , following the manufacturers protocol. quantitative pcr was carried out using an abi  <dig> sequence analyser . reactions were performed using the applied biosystems universal master mix according to the manufacturers instructions. the taqman probe / primers used were: vash <dig> , sox <dig> , ptx <dig> , fam78a , ppara , slc7a <dig> , bdnf , mtss <dig> , btg <dig> , tnfsf- <dig> , flt <dig>  and ntrk <dig> , all from applied biosystems.

previosuly generated microarray datasets used in this study
the sirna targeting of  <dig> different mrna transcripts, chosen for their importance in ec biology, including transcription factors, signalling molecules, receptors and ligands is described by hurley et. al.  <cit> . the microarray data from these  <dig> sirna experiments is available from gene expression omnibus, reference gse <dig> 

the generation of triplicated microarray data from an eight time point huvec sfd time course has been described previously  <cit> . briefly, huvec rna was extracted at time points  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after survival factor withdrawal , and hybridised onto codelink human uniset 20k microarrays. the raw and normalised triplicate time course microarray data has been deposited in gene expression omnibus, accession number gse <dig> 

data processing
codelink microarray quality was assessed using the codelink expression analysis software v <dig> . the array data were filtered to remove probes that did not contain “good” flags in 90% of the arrays, as measured by the codelink expression analysis software. the log base <dig> –transformed apoptosis time course data and  <dig> sirna disruptant data were then both normalised using the loess method  <cit> . for the disruptant dataset log <dig> ratios against a virtual median array were calculated and these ratios were then z-transformed within each microarray prior to network inference.

for the sfd time course data, we selected transcripts concordantly regulated in abundance across the timecourse to used for grn generation as previously described  <cit> . briefly, log ratios between each time point and the first time point were calculated for all transcripts. for each transcript at each time point z-scores were then calculated by subtracting the log <dig> ratios from the mean of log <dig> ratios for that time point, and dividing by the standard deviation of log <dig> ratios for that time point. transcripts were then selected that had − <dig> ≤ z ≤+ <dig> at ≥ two adjacent time points in the triplicate data set. this analysis was repeated using the last time point instead of the first time point, and the union of the rna lists prodced by the analyses that used the first and last timepoints was taken as the final list of concordantly expresed rnas. for comparison to this z-score method, anova was used to identify rnas significantly differntially expressed at two adjacent time points relative to either the first or last time point, and the empirical bayes method of tai and speed  <cit>  was also applied. in addition, a statistically more complex method was used to identify rnas significantly differntially expressed across the timecourse; generalised estimating equations with a markov correlation model were fitted to the timecourse data. contrasts were used to identify linear relationships and quadratic trends within the data using matlab's geeqbox toolbox . thresholds for concordant regulation were set using an absolute linear coefficient of > <dig>  or an absolute quadratic coefficient of >  <dig> .

all other bioinformatic manipulations used the r software package, , and unless otherwise stated, multiple testing corrections were applied using the benjamini and hochberg method. gene ontology/pathway enrichment analyses were carried out using fatigo software  <cit> , genesetdb  <cit> , gather  and ipa .

apoptosis bayesian grn generation and analysis
apoptosis bayesian networks were generated using the methods of  <cit> , with some modifications. given the relative sizes of the time-course and sirna data sets, a dynamic grn generated from the time-course data was used as a prior for grn generated from the sirna data as described  <cit> .

when estimating the time-course grn from the apoptosis time course microaray data, a method of bootstrapping was applied to the data. with  <dig> time points  and  <dig> replicate microarray time course experiments, there are  <dig> =  <dig> possible combinations to create combinatorial apoptosis time course datasets. with such a large number of combinations, it is not computationally viable to fit regression curves through all combinations. therefore the time course data used for network estimation was generated from the random resampling of  <dig> of the possible  <dig> combinations as follows: let d be the combinatorial time course data of all genes. if d is the  <dig> time points, with each time point consisting of one of  <dig> replicates, then d can be randomly resampled with replacement  <dig> times from the  <dig> combinations so that d . the bootstrap sample can therefore be defined as d* = {d* ,…., d* }. using this sample of  <dig> x  <dig> =  <dig> randomly resampled microarrays, the apoptosis grn was estimated. this bootstrapping procedure was repeated  <dig> times to generate  <dig> different grns; Ĝ*  t     <dig> … . Ĝ*  t     <dig>  where Ĝ*  t    b is the estimated graph based on the b-th bootstrap sample. to estimate the reliability of the edges to be used as prior information, the bootstrap probability of each edge was calculated as follows: the reliability of the edge between the i-th gene to the j-th gene  is zij1=|b|ei,j∈g^t*b,b= <dig> …,100|/ <dig>  a bootstrap probability threshold value was set at p =  <dig>  and only those edges that passed this threshold value were included in the prior, z <dig> 

as described  <cit> , a second prior , was also generated. this prior was based on the up- or down-regulation of the abundance of all mrnas, represented as z-scores, analysed by the microarrays following sirna-medaited targeting of the  <dig> genes.

priors z <dig> and z <dig>  were used when inferring a static bayesian network based on the disruptant dataset  <cit> . again bootstrap resampling of the microarrays  was applied to improve the reliability of edges included in the final network. the grns were viewed and analysed using cell illustrator  <dig> , freely available software that can be downloaded from http://www.cellillustrator.com.

quantification of apoptosis
passage  <dig> huvec pools comprising equal numbers of cells from  <dig> independant isolates were plated at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well in a 96-well plate and cultured for  <dig> hrs before sirna transfection. three different pools of  <dig> isolates were used for each assay. cells were then left for a further 24hrs before treatment with either survival factor deprived conditions of basal media without supplements  or fully supplemented media without antibiotics  for  <dig> hrs. active caspase- <dig> and − <dig> were quantified using the caspase-glo 3/ <dig> assay system, following the manufacturer’s instructions . the adp:atp ratio was calculated using the apo glow assay , according to the manufacture’s protocol. assays were carried out using a fluostar optima luminometer . statistical analysis was carried out using a paired two-tailed t-test.

RESULTS
gene selection methods for generating a bayesian grn to model ec apoptosis
for grn modelling, we first identified mrna transcripts that were significantly regulated over the timecourse of ec apoptosis. a z-score-based method for analysis of timecourse data that we have reported previously  identified  <dig> significantly regulated transcripts. we analysed these  <dig> rnas using the genesetdb web tool  <cit>  with the gene ontology  and wikipathways databases. the rnas were significantly enriched for four main categories of annotation:  'cell cycle' ,  'response to stress' ,  'apoptosis'  and  'immune response' .

bayesian grn inference
in an attempt to better understand the relationships between the mrnas concordantly regulated in abundance during sfd, a bayesian grn was inferred. in theory, the more data that grn are based on, the the more accurate their predictions can be. therefore, for grn generation we used a combination of the sfd timecourse data and a library of  <dig> sirna disruptant microarrays. a total of  <dig> rnas were used for grn generation; the union of the  <dig> rnas concordantly regulated in abundance during sfd and the  <dig> rnas that were targeted by sirna. the methodology used to generate this bayesian network has been previously described  <cit>  and is illustrated in figure  <dig>  an xml file describing this grn can be found in additional file  <dig>  which can be viewed using the freely available software cell illustrator, and a text file listing parent and child genes for the network edges is given in additional file  <dig> 


identification of grn hubs
hubs are highly connected nodes in grns and are candidate master regulators within the network structure. in a directional grn such as the bayesian networks generated here, they can be identified on the basis of having large numbers of downstream children. the distribution of the number of children of all nodes in the grn is shown in the histogram in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  a list of the  <dig> hub genes with the largest number of children  in the network is shown in additional file  <dig>  given that the set of rnas used for grn inference was already enriched for cell cycle and stress response functions as described above, it is not surprising that many of the grn hubs appeared to be involved in these processes. only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that were targetted by sirna knock-down to generate the prior microarray data were significantly concordantly regulated in abundance over the survival factor deprivation timecourse . of these  <dig> rnas,  <dig> are in the list of the to  <dig> hubs .

we looked specifically at apoptosis-associated rnas in the grn. analaysis using the fatigo software  identified  <dig> probes in the codelink array data that encoded proteins involved in apoptosis,  <dig> of these probes were included as nodes in the apoptosis gene network ; two of these  were found in the top  <dig> hubs ranked by number of downstream network children.

we also looked specifically at cell cycle-associated rnas in the grn, since sfd induces cell cycle arrest in addition to programmed cell death  <cit> . of the  <dig> transcripts on the codelink array associated with cell cycle regulation,  <dig> of these were included as nodes in the network, with  <dig> located within the top  <dig> network hubs ranked by number of downstream children.

downstream children of some grn hubs share common functions
we assessed whether any of grn hubs had downstream children significantly enriched for specific biological functions by comparing the downstream children of each hub to the datatbases go, kegg and transfac using the gather web tool. the results of this analysis are shown in additional file  <dig> and examples are given below. the hub transcript blm  encodes a dna helicase that is important for mitotic dna replication and dna repair, and is mutated in a broad range of cancers  <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig> children of blm encoded proteins involved in aspects of cell cycle regulation . another hub gene encodes the cyclin dependent kinase-binding protein cks1b, which has  <dig> of its  <dig> grn children associated with cell cycle control . the hub kntc <dig> encodes a kinetochore complex component that functions as a spindle checkpoint signalling molecule, and has  <dig> of its  <dig> children associated with the cell cycle . another hub is grn, encoding the granulin glycoprotein, a secreted regulator of cell growth and survival.  <dig> of grn’s  <dig> children are associated with the response to cell stress , and  <dig> with the regulation of apoptosis . the children emenating from the apoptosis-associated hubs hspe <dig> and bub1b mentioned above also shared comon functions, however the degree of enrichment for these functions was not statistically significant. four of the  <dig> children of bub1b were involved in cell cycle regulation  and two in the regualtion of apoptosis . similarly, three of the  <dig> children of hspe <dig> were involved in cell cycle processes  and two with cell death .

identification of a novel grn hub gene for further study
evaluation of the literature revealed that several of the most highly connected hubs , already had well-characterised roles in cellular proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . in contrast, for vash <dig>  there was no literature characterising its involvement in ec apoptosis or cellular proliferation at the time of this study. several of the predicted grn children of vash <dig> are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis , apoptosis  and cell division . therefore, given that the purpose of this current study was to identifiy novel regulators of ec apoptosis and since vash <dig> had previously been identified as a negative regulator of angiogenesis  <cit>  , vash <dig> was selected as a candidate for further investigation. due to resource limitations no other uncharacterised hubs were investigated in this study. figure  <dig> illustrates the positioning of the vash <dig> hub in the grn, the  <dig> children eminating from this hub, and its expression profile over the sfd time course.


vash <dig> would not have been prioritised as a candidate gene for further study by using traditional statistical methods that quantified the degree and variance of concordant regulation of abundance over the sfd time course. for example, when the concordant regulation of rnas were ranked using the z-score method or using traditional anova analysis to compare expression in the first and last timepoints to all other timepoints, vash <dig> was ranked 71st and 63rd, respectively. the empirical bayes method of tai and speed using the hotelling t2-statistic  <cit>  ranked vash <dig> as 286th in terms of evidence of non-constant temporal expression. a more sophisticated method was also used, in which generalised estimating equations  were fitted to the sfd time course data. from this regression model contrasts were used to identify linear relationships and quadratic trends within the data, and vash <dig> ranked 175th.

independent validation of directed edges emanating from the vash <dig> hub
to evaluate the rnas hypothesised by the grn to be downstream of the vash <dig> hub,  <dig> of the  <dig> children were selected for independent validation using sirna knock-down and quantitative pcr. the selection was based on known biological importance and reagent availability. the left column of panels in figure  <dig> illustrates the transcript profiles of vash <dig> and selected children over the sfd time course. in the case of mtss <dig>  and sox <dig> , the children are positively co-regulated with vash <dig> over the apoptosis time course. in contrast, bdnf  and slc7a <dig>  are negatively co-regulated with vash <dig> over the time course. correlation analysis across the  <dig> sirna disruptant dataset revealed that all  <dig> children correlated with vash <dig> ; the relationships between vash <dig> and these downstream children across the  <dig> sirna disruptant microarrays are illustrated in scatter plots in the middle panels of figure  <dig>  vash1-slc7a <dig> and vash1-bdnf associated with negative correlation, while the remaining children correlate positively with vash <dig> . this correlation across the  <dig> sirna disruptant dataset concurred with the co-regulation observed over the apoptosis time course in figure 3a, d, g and j.


using sirna to knockdown vash <dig> mrna to ≤ 20% of its initial level appeared to significantly regulate  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts tested, in the direction predicted by the grn . for example, mtss <dig> and sox <dig>  which were positively correlated with vash <dig>  were down-regulated after knockdown of vash <dig> . in contrast, but as predicted by the grn, knockdown of vash <dig> resulted in the up-regulation of bdnf and slc7a <dig>  which were negatively correlated with vash <dig> . tnfsf <dig>  ptx <dig> and fam78a did not show a clear result due to variable regulation between ec replicate pools.


p values are from a paired t test.

regulation of apoptosis by vash1
to evaluate whether the vash <dig> hub is involved in the process or regulation of ec apoptosis, sirna was used to knockdown vash <dig> in three different pools of  <dig> huvec isolates for  <dig> hours before treatment with sfd to induce apoptosis. after the  <dig> hour anti-vash <dig> sirna incubation, vash <dig> mrna abundance was reduced to ≤ 20% of its initial level . following sfd there was a mean of  <dig>  fold  less active caspase- <dig> and − <dig> in the vash <dig> knockdown ec compared to the ec teated with non-targeting sirna controls . repetition of this assay in two additional pools of huvec isolates in which vash <dig> was once again knocked down to ≤ 20% of its initial level produced a similar result - following sfd there was on average  <dig>  fold  less active caspase- <dig> and − <dig> following vash <dig> knockdown than in control cells . the observed level of active caspase- <dig> and − <dig> in huvec in fully supplemented conditions was similar in vash <dig> knockdown and control cells .


the activation of caspase- <dig> and − <dig> only represents one part the complex process of apoptosis. since apoptosis is an energy driven process, the adt:atp ratio was also calculated in the same huvec pools. a marked reduction in the mean adp:atp ratio was observed in the vash <dig> knockdown ec relative to the sirna control ec following sfd in two independent experiments . again, no significant difference was observed between the vash <dig> knock down ec and controls in fully supplemented conditions . taken together, these results suggest that vash <dig> may play a significant role in sfd-induced apoptosis of huvecs.

the inverse expression relationship between vash <dig> and its validated child bdnf, and the known role of bdnf as a survival factor, suggests the hypothesis that up-regulation of bdnf when vash <dig> is knocked down may promote survival in these cells. however, the treatment of the huvec pools with 100nm recombinant bdnf at  <dig> hours post-transfection , did not induce significant rescue from sfd-induced cell death, as measured by both the quantification of active caspase- <dig> and  <dig> and the adp:atp ratio .

discussion
this study used bayesian grn technology and microarray data to model the regulatory interactions after serum factor deprivation of ec, which induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. we applied grn analysis to combined time course microarray data following serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of ec, and a large microarray data set generated from  <dig> targeted ec sirna disruptions, in order to identifiy new information about gene regulatory relationships during ec apoptosis.

grn topology and limitations
we have used grn analysis to identify hubs, which potentially act as master regulators of the expression of downstream rnas in ec. for one hub, vash <dig>  we then confirmed the concordant regulation of a subset of downstream children as hypothesised by the grn, and an impact on apoptosis. vash <dig> protein has previously been identified as a negative feedback regulator of angiogenesis, and is induced through signalling via vegfr <dig> and protein kinase c  <cit> . these findings are consistent with a role for vash <dig> as a key regulator of ec biology, and with the position of vash <dig> as a hub in the grn with an effect on ec apoptosis.

we suggest that grn analysis may provide a useful compliment to traditional analysis of microarray or rnaseq data, especially for identifying putative master-regulators for further study. we showed that alternative methods to identify apoptosis-associated rnas from time course expression data were unlikely to have selected vash <dig> as a candidate gene for subsequent functual analaysis. methods based on: z-scores, anova and empirical bayes all failed to prioritise vash <dig>  however, we also recognise the potential limitations of gene network analysis. firstly, only a few of the transcripts that encode protein mediators of apoptosis are expected to be up- or down-regulated during relatively short time points of sfd-induced apoptosis  <cit>  to a sufficint degree to be included in this analysis, and sfd is only one of many inducers of apoptosis. therefore, only a subset of known apoptosis-associated genes are accessible to this type of grn study. secondly, many genes known to be important in the apoptotic process may not be “master regulators” detectable as hubs in gene networks, which requires that they rapidly regulate the abundance of large numbers of downstream rnas. since we used timecourse microarray data from ec cells treated with survival factor deprivation, we expected to identify only master regulators that were specifically related to the molecular processes that occur during this timecourse. to be identified as a "hub" in the gene network, both an rna, and its downstream "child" rnas, must be significantly concordantly regulated over the timecourse. therefore, not all rnas important for ec biology will be concordantly regulated during this specialised type of apoptosis, and even if they are, they will not be identified as hubs unless they rapidly regulate the abundance of large numbers downstream rna transcripts. thirdly, like all in silico modelling based on microarray or rnaseq data, results of special interest from grn analysis need to be confimred using laboratory experiments as we have done here.

inference of local relationships within the network
several grn methods have proven informative for identifying regulatory hubs or cohorts of co-expressed genes in complex eukaryotic cells, which are involved in important disease processes  <cit> . however, most of these methods fall short of inferring directional relationships at a local level. therefore, having identified the vash <dig> hub based on network topology, we examined the grn predictions surrounding this hub in more detail. using sirna we knocked down vash <dig> mrna and determined the effect on expression levels of downstream mrnas for ten out of vash1's  <dig> grn children. seven out of the ten children tested were significantly up- or down-regulated in the direction predicted by the grn . the lack of clear influence of vash <dig> knock-down on three child-transcripts may be due to several factors:  reducing vash <dig> rna may have little effect on the abundance of those gene network children of vash <dig> that are strongly influenced by other parents in addition to vash <dig> - the undiminished effects of these other parents would be expected to hide the effect of reducing vash <dig> expression.  regulatory relationships that are not represented in the grn may influence the expression of some of vash1's gene network children,  despite best efforts, the effects of experimental noise and unintended model over-fitting are likely to have introduced error in the inference process. these issues are further described in our recent publications  <cit> . it is possible that additional sirna data may improve the accuracy of grns around vash <dig>  which is a subject for future research.

whether the observed level of concordance between the network predictions and the results of experimental vash <dig> knockdown only surrounds the major hubs within the bayesian network structure, or is randomly distributed throughout the network, requires further investigation. due to resource constraints we have only evaluated a minority of edges downstream of a single hub. this is clearly not enough to draw any general conclusions about grns and their reliability. given further resources, we would like to evaluate the relationships between vash <dig> and the remaining  <dig> children that we have not yet tested, as well as the relationships between several other nodes and their children. to more completely test local network relationships we would ultimately need to simultaneously perform sirna-mediated "knockdown" of all the gene network parents of each vash <dig> child then measure the effect on vash <dig> child abundance. in addition, as computational capabilities improve, it would be interesting to re-engineer grns with the inclusion of more of the replicate arrays and compare the reliability with that of the current network model. nevertheless, given the early stage of this technology, the fact that only one  of several parents of the evaluated vash <dig> children was knocked down, and the fact that there are data missing from the network , these current findings appear promising.

functional significance of the vash <dig> gene network hub
to investigate whether the vash <dig> hub was biologically relevant during endothelial apoptosis, we used sirnas targeted against vash <dig> to reduce mrna abundance to <20% of its initial level and quantified the level of apoptosis in these cells under conditions of sfd relative to control cells transfected with an irrelevant sirna. the measurement of active caspase- <dig> and − <dig> and the adp:atp ratio were used as end-points and the knock-down of vash <dig> conferred resistance to the pro-apoptotic stimulus of serum deprivation. this confirms a role for vash <dig> in the process of ec apoptosis, and is consistent with a study published since this research was conducted that shows over expression of vash <dig> induced apoptosis in proliferating human fibroblasts  <cit> .

although the mechanism by which vash <dig> regulates ec survival is beyond the scope of this study, it is intriguing to examine the function of vash1’s grn children in the anticipation that this may suggest how vash <dig> acts. ingenuity pathways analysis  suggested that the vash <dig> grn children are significantly enriched for genes associated with angiogenesis , including several well-known angiogenic regulators; bdnf, dll <dig> , flt <dig> , ppara, ptx <dig>  sox <dig>  tie <dig>  and tnfsf <dig> . several of the vash <dig> children have previously been associated with the linked control of proliferation and apoptosis e.g. cdkn1c , cdc2l <dig>  gsn  and dll <dig>  it is interesting that  <dig> of the  <dig> vash <dig> children have binding sites for members of the e2f transcription factor family in their promoters ; experiments to assess whether e2f transactivation is regulated by vash <dig> may be worthwhile.

one mechanistic hypothesis was investigated in this study. the autocrine action of bdnf in cellular processes including angiogenesis, proliferation, differentiation and survival is well documented  <cit> . therefore, the inverse relationship between vash <dig> and its validated child bdnf, suggests a hypothesis that upregulation of bdnf when vash <dig> is knocked down may promote survival. however, recombinant bdnf was unable to rescue the cells from sfd induced death. it is possible that the chosen concentration of recombinant bdnf  and time point of administration were not optimal. however, the results suggest that it is unlikely that the mechanism of vash <dig> action in ec apoptosis is as simple as up-regulation of bdnf. the relatively low expression of the bdnf high affinity  and the low affinity  receptors observed in the microarray data from these cells  may also explain why exogenous bdnf was not effective.

since this study was conducted, several publications have described the role of vash <dig> in regulating ec proliferation, vascular tube generation and vascular maturation  <cit>  <cit> , as well as a potentially wider functional role in other cell types  <cit> . in addition, vash <dig> may interact in complex functional networks with related proteins such as vash <dig> to regulate angiogensis and ec survival differently in distinct angiogenic mechanisms  <cit> . whatever its mechanism of action, vash <dig> appears to be associated with angiogenesis in pathology  <cit> , and further investigation of the molecular networks that surround vash <dig> seem highly worthwhile.

CONCLUSIONS
grn analysis is able to supplement the reductionist methods of traditional molecular biology, providing testable hypotheses about the synergistic actions and interactions of multiple molecules  <cit> . we therefore applied bayesian grn methods to further our understanding of the regulation of ec apoptosis and proliferation. the sfd bayesian grn generated in this study identified vash <dig> as a candidate master regulator, which we found was functionally important during ec apoptosis. we also found that several individual directed edges emanating from vash <dig> in the grn appeared to operate in ecs. we hope that in future studies the datasets we describe here can be used by other researchers to identify additional candidate master regulators for laboratory evaluation.
