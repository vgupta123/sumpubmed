BACKGROUND
 <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that elicits a broad spectrum of biochemical and physiological effects in a species-specific manner  <cit> . these effects include lethality, cancer, developmental abnormalities, immunotoxicity, skin lesions, hepatotoxicity, and xenobiotic enzyme metabolism induction. they result from altered gene expression mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor , a ligand activated transcription factor  <cit> . briefly, tcdd binds to the cytoplasmic ahr causing nuclear translocation and heterodimerization with the ahr nuclear translocator . the heterodimer then binds to specific dna elements, termed dioxin response elements , within the regulatory regions of targeted genes to modulate expression, resulting in downstream physiological responses  <cit> . although the structure and function of the ahr are highly conserved  <cit> , the sensitivity to and the responses elicited by tcdd vary widely across species, suggesting tcdd and related compounds may activate species-specific ahr-mediated gene expression networks.

risk assessment assumes that there is a conserved mode of action and comparable toxic responses between species. however, there are inherent differences between species that compromise the extrapolation of rodent data to estimate potential human risks. moreover, there is a discord between preclinical animal testing compared to human clinical trials regarding toxicity  <cit> . similarly, species differ widely in response to tcdd exposure. for example, ld <dig> values range from  <dig> μg/kg in the guinea pig  <cit>  to > <dig> μg/kg for the hamster, and several responses exhibit species-specific sensitivities and toxicities. these differential effects are not attributed to differences in binding affinity or ahr complex stability  <cit> . collectively, these data suggest that although the ahr is well conserved, subsequent differential gene expression responses are species-specific.

to further investigate differences in tcdd elicited differential gene expression, global gene expression was assessed in human hepg <dig>  mouse hepa1c1c <dig> and rat h4iie hepatoma cells following treatment with tcdd. comparative analysis indicates there are significant differences in gene expression between species, suggesting ahr-mediated gene expression may not be conserved.

RESULTS
temporally conserved gene expression responses elicited by tcdd
species-specific, cdna microarrays were used to profile the temporal gene expression elicited by tcdd in human hepg <dig>  mouse hepa1c1c <dig> and rat h4iie cells. the microarrays queried  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unique human, mouse and rat genes, respectively . empirical bayes analysis identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  >  <dig>  and |fold change| >  <dig> ) in hepg <dig>  hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells, respectively. complete cdna microarray data sets are provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  hepg <dig> cells were the most responsive as indicated by both the overall number of differentially expressed genes as well as the number of responsive genes at each time point . h4iie cells exhibited significantly less differentially expressed genes, partially explained by the smaller microarray and the immaturity of rat genome annotation compared to the human and mouse. differentially expressed genes were hierarchically clustered based on euclidian distance and distinct clusters of temporal gene expression patterns were identified .

pair-wise comparisons of differentially expressed genes were conducted using homologene  defined orthologs . human and mouse cdna microarrays shared  <dig> orthologous genes, however only  <dig> %  were differentially regulated by tcdd in hepg <dig> and hepa1c1c <dig> cells. comparison of the rodent platforms identified  <dig> orthologs with only  <dig> %  responding in both hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells. the lack of conserved ortholog differential expression in hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells is consistent with the reported differences in differential expression observed in vivo between mice and rats  <cit> . time dependent profiling of hepg <dig> and h4iie gene expression identified only  <dig> conserved responses out of  <dig> possible orthologs, representing only  <dig> % . comparative analysis across all three species with  <dig> shared orthologous probes identified only one ortholog that was differentially regulated in all three cell lines . note that other members of the ahr gene battery, namely cyp1a <dig>  aldh3a <dig> and nqo <dig>  were not present across all of the cdna microarray platforms. however, their responses were also conserved across all three cell lines when measured using qrtpcr. the results for cyp1a <dig> are shown in figure  <dig> 

identification of putative primary gene expression responses
in order to further investigate ahr-mediated responses, tcdd-elicited differential gene expression was examined in the presence of cycloheximide , a protein translation inhibitor. putative primary responses were defined in this study as those where chx co-treatment either maintained or enhanced the response elicited by tcdd, while responses that were attenuated or blocked by chx co-treatment were classified as secondary responses based on their assumed dependence on additional protein translation. cdna microarray analysis confirmed the superinduction of cyp1a <dig> mrna in chx co-treated hepa1c1c <dig> cells  <cit> , consistent with the superinduction in human mcf10a cells treated with tcdd  <cit> . additionally, hepa1c1c <dig> arnt-deficient c <dig> mutants treated with tcdd did not exhibit induction of the prototypical ahr battery genes including cyp1a <dig>  <cit> . collectively, these results indicate that cyp1a <dig> is a primary gene expression response consistent with the direct interaction of the ahr with dres within the promoter region.

for each species, differentially expressed orthologs were classified as primary or secondary responses based on chx co-treatment studies at both  <dig> and  <dig> hrs. overall  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> human, mouse and rat orthologs, respectively, were considered primary responses . furthermore,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> orthologous genes in the hepg <dig>  hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells were classified as secondary ahr responses . comparative examination of the chx co-treatment data suggested that each cell line had its own unique set of primary responsive orthologs.

whole-genome analysis of conserved tcdd-elicited gene expression responses
the lack of whole genome coverage on the human, mouse and rat cdna microarrays limited the number of orthologs that could be investigated. therefore, whole genome expression analysis was performed at  <dig> hrs, one of the most active time points in terms of the number of differentially expressed genes , using  <dig> ×  <dig> k agilent oligonucleotide microarrays. each microarray contained more than  <dig>  individual probes, representing more than  <dig>  unique genes . despite the increased coverage, the number of tcdd elicited differentially expressed genes were surprisingly small relative to the cdna microarray results. for example, the human agilent microarray consisted of  <dig>  known genes, representing a  <dig> -fold increase in coverage compared to the human cdna microarray. however, only  <dig> unique genes were differentially expressed, a modest increase from the  <dig> genes identified using cdna microarrays. similarly, only  <dig> and  <dig> genes were responsive in the hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells, respectively. complete agilent microarray data sets are provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>

the use of whole genome microarrays also increased the number of orthologs that could be examined . as seen with the cdna microarray dataset pair-wise comparisons, hepg <dig> and hepa1c1c <dig> cells shared the greatest number of tcdd responsive orthologs . ortholog coverage between all three species increased from  <dig> on the cdna microarrays to  <dig>  across the agilent platforms. comparative analysis  >  <dig>  and |fold change| >  <dig> ) identified only  <dig> orthologs that were differentially expressed by tcdd at  <dig> hrs . whole genome expression profiling identified the species-conserved induction of cyp1a <dig>  tiparp and ugt1a <dig> in all three cell lines. despite this increased coverage, the number of differentially expressed orthologs across all three cell lines remained small, consistent with our cdna microarray results.

species-specific & species-divergent gene expression responses
whole genome comparative analysis of hepg <dig>  hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie responses identified genes that were species-specific, i.e. differentially expressed in only a single species. for example, microarray analysis at  <dig> hrs found that fibromodulin  was significantly up-regulated  <dig> -fold in the hepg <dig> cells while no significant change in expression was detected in the hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells. other examples of mouse and rat specific responses include forkhead box q <dig>  and ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase  <dig> . foxq <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in the hepa1c1c <dig> cells while entpd <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in the h4iie cells. for both of these genes, the corresponding ortholog in the other two species did not exhibit significant differential expression. the species-specific responses of fmod, foxq <dig> and entpd were verified using qrtpcr . these responses are consistent with previous reports of species-specific tcdd elicited hepatic gene expression characterized in mice and rats  <cit> .

comparative analysis of the orthologous gene expression responses in hepg <dig>  hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie datasets identified  <dig> orthologs that were differentially expressed by tcdd across the three models. further analysis indicated that not all of these responses were directionally conserved, i.e. pattern of expression was not the same in all species. for example, ier <dig> was induced  <dig> -fold in hepa1c1c <dig> cells at  <dig> hrs and  <dig> -fold in h4iie cells at  <dig> hrs, but repressed - <dig> -fold in hepg <dig> cells at  <dig> hrs. likewise, glutathione s-transferase alpha  <dig>  was induced  <dig> -fold in hepa1c1c <dig> cells and  <dig> -fold in h4iie cells, but down-regulated  <dig> -fold in hepg <dig> cells. qrtpcr confirmed the divergent expression of gsta <dig> in the rat and human cell lines, but found hepa1c1c <dig> cells were relatively non-responsive . two other orthologs, cyclin d <dig>  and inhibitor of dna binding  <dig> , also exhibited divergent expression between species, where the orthologs were down-regulated in the rodent cell lines but induced in hepg <dig> cells . species-specific and species-divergent responses have also been reported in vivo for tcdd elicited hepatic differential gene expression in mice and rats  <cit> .

functional enrichment and network analysis
microarray analysis identified a small subset of tcdd responsive genes in the entire genome of each species. differentially expressed genes elicited by tcdd in each cell line were clustered for functional enrichment based on go terms . enriched hepg <dig>  hepa1c1c <dig>  and h4iie responses clusters included go terms related to xenobiotic exposure  and metabolism  , indicating that these processes are conserved in all three cell lines, and consistent with reported in vivo studies using rats and mice <cit> . however, other enriched go terms, such as those related to lipid metabolism and transport, were only enriched in hepg <dig> and h4iie cell lines. genes functionally related to lipid metabolism were further analyzed using ingenuity pathway analysis to identify a network of tcdd-responsive orthologs, and species-conserved and -specific responses . although go terms related to lipid metabolism were enriched hepg <dig> and h4iie differential gene expression data sets, there were few orthologs that exhibited differential regulation in both cell lines based on the fold-change and statistical cutoffs used. in vivo rat studies also identified enrichment of genes related to lipid metabolism following tcdd treatment, suggesting that h4iie cells may be predictive of tcdd-induced perturbations of this pathway rats.

despite the nature of these continuous cell lines and the dysregulation of genes related to cell cycle control and regulation, go terms associated with these functions were not enriched across all three cell lines. tcdd-treated human hepg <dig> and mouse hepa1c1c <dig> cell lines identified functional clusters associated with cell cycle control  were in enriched tcdd-treated hepg <dig> and hepa1c1c <dig> gene expression data sets, but not in the h4iie data set. species-differences in functional clustering of tcdd-elicited differentially expressed gene data sets further corroborate species-specific responses to tcdd.

dioxin response element analysis
putative functional dres are not equally distributed between species with more dres associated with known human genes  <cit> . within the human genome, there are  <dig>  dre cores in the proximal promoter regions of known genes , with  <dig>  and  <dig>  dre cores, in the mouse and rat genomes, respectively. to further investigate the divergent expression of ccnd <dig>  id <dig> and gsta <dig>  their proximal promoter regions were searched for dre cores. human orthologs of ccnd <dig> and id <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> dre cores, respectively, greater than the number found in either the mouse or rat genomes. in contrast, mouse and rat orthologs of gsta <dig> each had  <dig> and  <dig> dre cores, respectively, while the human only had  <dig> . in each of these divergently regulated orthologs, the species with the greatest number of dre cores within the regulatory region had the highest fold induction suggesting that species-specific regulons have important roles in regulating gene expression.

each dre core in the gsta <dig> orthologs was extended by  <dig> bp on either end and assessed for sequence similarity by measuring the euclidean distance between sequence pairs. only the mouse and rat gsta <dig> contained highly similar dre sequences , and no human dre sequences with high sequence similarity. furthermore, the position of the conserved dre sequence  <dig> bp upstream of the tss in the mouse appears to be positionally conserved with the dre sequence in rat the ortholog located  <dig> bp upstream of the tss. collectively, the disproportionate number of dres between species and lack of sequence and spatially conserved dres may account for the divergent regulation of human, mouse and rat gsta <dig> orthologs.

discussion
this study comprehensively and systematically compares the gene expression responses elicited by tcdd across human, mouse and rat cells. incorporating both custom cdna microarrays to profile the temporal responses and more comprehensive commercial oligonucleotide microarrays, a limited number of conserved responses between species were identified. in addition, divergent and a large number of species-specific responses were identified that may contribute to species-specific differences in sensitivity and toxicity. these results are consistent with the poor response correlations of orthologous genes between c57bl/ <dig> mice, sprague dawley and long-evans rats  <cit> . collectively, reported in vivo rodent comparisons, and the in vitro data presented in this study suggest there are significant differences in tcdd elicited gene expression between species, despite the conservation of the ahr  <cit>  and its signaling pathway.

in vivo and in vitro studies examining tcdd-elicited global gene expression have demonstrated that ahr targets a limited portion of the genome  <cit> . in addition, pwm-based computational searches identified a low percentage of orthologs with conserved putative functional dres within their regulatory regions   <cit> . our comparative in vitro microarray results corroborate these findings. temporal analysis using custom cdna microarrays found that tcdd elicited a response in  <dig> % of the represented genes in the hepg <dig> cells,  <dig> % in the hepa1c1c <dig> cells and only  <dig> % in the h4iie cells. similar results were obtained using whole-genome microarrays where  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genes exhibiting differential expression in hepg <dig>  hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells, respectively, at  <dig> hrs.

all three cell lines differentially expressed a core set of conserved gene responses that included the induction of cyp1a <dig>  nqo <dig> and ugt1a <dig>  members of the ahr gene battery  <cit> . however, a significant number of responses were specific to a single species , as reported in in vivo studies  <cit> . moreover, these studies not only identified species-specific responses, but also orthologs with divergent responses . comparisons of c57bl/ <dig> mouse and sprague dawley rat responses found that 29% of the commonly regulated orthologs exhibited divergent regulation  <cit> . similarly, gsta <dig>  ccnd <dig> and id <dig>  exhibited divergent regulation across hepg <dig>  hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells . each of these genes exhibited the same pattern with hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells having comparable profiles while hepg <dig> cells exhibited the divergent response. for example, gsta <dig> was up-regulated in hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells, but down-regulated in hepg <dig> cells . in vivo gene expression responses of gsta <dig> orthologs matched the in vitro responses in the hepa1c1c <dig> and h4iie cells; tcdd treated mice and rats exhibited  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold maximum induction, respectively  <cit> . qrtpcr verified the divergent response of gsta <dig> in the h4iie and hepg <dig> cells, but did not detect a significant induction in the hepa1c1c <dig> cells .

computational analysis of gst5a found a disproportionate number of dre cores within the regulatory region sequence of each species . sequence analysis also found dre sequences with high similarity in the mouse and rat orthologs, but not in the human gsta <dig>  the identification of species-specific dres is consistent with the divergent regulation of gsta <dig> between these cell lines. overall, differences in ortholog expression may contribute to differences in tcdd sensitivity and toxicity across species.

although these continuous cells lines are similar in morphology and were derived from hepatomas, there are inherent differences that may bias the identification of species-conserved and -divergent responses. for example, hepg <dig> cells were originally derived from the liver biopsy of a 15-year old caucasian male and therefore may not be representative of a mature adult liver  <cit> . recent studies have compared basal gene expression of liver samples to primary human hepatocytes, hepg <dig> and heparg cells, another human hepatoma cell line. although, heparg cells were most similar to primary hepatocytes and liver samples  <cit> , toxicogenomic studies report that heparg and hepg <dig> gene expression responses retained common functional processes  <cit> . in addition, the heparg donor differed in age and sex compared to the hepg <dig> patient, and was also infected with hepatitis c, which may affect both basal and tcdd-elicited gene expression. hepg <dig> cells were more sensitive in terms of the magnitude of regulation, and also in the terms of the total number of differentially regulated genes, and may be a more sensitive model for assessing tcdd exposure  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although a core set of conserved gene responses was identified, consistent with the role of ahr in mediating the adaptive metabolic responses, further evidence of differences in genome-wide gene expression profiles between species  is also presented. this is consistent with species-specific differences in tcdd sensitivity and toxicity  <cit> , which are due to alterations in gene expression. furthermore, there is a lack of conserved putative dres within orthologous genes  <cit> , and differences in genome-wide gene expression profiles has been reported between mice and rats in vivo  <cit> . undoubtedly, the number of conserved responses and immaturity of the genome annotation, especially for the rat, limits the overall interspecies comparison  <cit> . differences in ahr levels, co-activator availability, and protocols used in their isolation of these hepatoma cells may confound our comparisons. nevertheless, the identification of numerous species-specific responses, evidence of divergent gene expression responses between species, and the discovery of distinct putative primary response sets in each cell line provides further compelling evidence that the effects of tcdd post-ahr binding are not conserved between species.
