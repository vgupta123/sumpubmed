BACKGROUND
parents provide the earliest social environment children come into contact with and, through their parenting efforts and socialization strategies, parents exert a lasting influence on their children’s development, social functioning, and well-being
 <cit> . some socialization strategies, though very effective in the short run, may come at a considerable cost in terms of the child’s later functioning and well-being. love withdrawal is one such strategy. love withdrawal is a way of disciplining the child by withholding or withdrawing signs of love and affection in response to the child’s misbehavior or failure. the sense of conditional regard this instils in the child  is thought to underlie both the effectiveness and the emotional costs of love withdrawal
 <cit>  . negative outcomes that have been related to parental, and in particular maternal, use of love withdrawal include feelings of resentment toward the parents, fear of failure, low emotional well-being, and low self-esteem in adolescence and young adulthood
 <cit> . excessive use of love withdrawal can be considered psychological maltreatment
 <cit> .

much less is known, however, about the effects of love withdrawal on the neural processes that may underlie its behavioral consequences. knowledge of these neural correlates will aid our understanding of the mechanisms through which parents’ socialization strategies affect socio-emotional development and functioning, and may eventually offer a starting point for parenting support, intervention, and treatment. recent results from our laboratory have begun to show that experiences of love withdrawal do also relate to the neural processing of socio-emotional information relevant to a link between performance/compliance and relational consequences: experiences of love withdrawal were related to the amplitude of vertex positive potential , n <dig>  and late positive potential  components of the event-related potential  in response to feedback stimuli combining performance feedback with emotional facial expressions
 <cit> . corroborating evidence comes from a study relating similar neural processes to fear of failure, a characteristic related to love withdrawal
 <cit> . in addition, experiences of love withdrawal have been found to moderate effects of oxytocin on neural indices of social information processing 
 <cit> , as well as prosocial
 <cit>  and altruistic behavior
 <cit> . the current study follows-up on our previous work by attempting to confirm and extend previous findings regarding effects of love withdrawal on vpp and lpp amplitudes.

the vpp is a positive deflection in the erp that peaks at frontocentral electrode sites, roughly between  <dig> and 180 ms after stimulus onset. the vpp has been associated with the configural processing of faces, showing larger amplitudes in response to emotional compared to neutral expressions
 <cit> . vpp and n <dig>  are often found to be sensitive to intensity, but not valence of emotional expressions
 <cit> . the lpp is a centroparietally distributed, positive-going modulation of the erp beginning about 300–400 ms after stimulus onset
 <cit> . the amplitude of the lpp is more positive for emotional stimuli, both pleasant and unpleasant, compared to neutral stimuli. also, its amplitude may be influenced by both automatic  and controlled  processes
 <cit> .

in our previous experiment, which was the first to examine effects of both love withdrawal and oxytocin on event-related potentials  to facial feedback stimuli, love withdrawal affected the amplitudes of both these erp components. erps were recorded during performance of a flanker task in response to feedback stimuli combining performance feedback with emotional faces: a picture of a happy or disgusted face was presented in green after each correct response and in red after each error
 <cit> . experiences of maternal love withdrawal both moderated effects of oxytocin on vpp amplitude
 <cit>  and predicted more positive vpp amplitudes, indicative of more extensive face processing, under placebo conditions
 <cit> . these results were consistent with the idea that experiences of love withdrawal heighten the relevance of and focus on emotional expressions in performance situations, as these are potential indicators of relational consequences linked to success and failure. more love withdrawal also predicted more positive lpp amplitudes in response to disgusted compared to happy faces, specifically following an erroneous response. this suggested that love withdrawal relates to the allocation of attention toward the motivationally relevant combination of negative feedback with a disgusted face
 <cit> .

in light of the recent debate about the  replicability of findings from psychological research  it is essential to confirm novel findings, both through replication studies by independent research groups and through follow-up research by the original authors. the current experiment therefore follows-up on our previous work by attempting to confirm and extend the results regarding maternal love withdrawal and erps in an independent sample  using the same facial feedback stimuli described above, but in a slightly adapted experimental context. because the flanker task, used in our previous experiment, has the disadvantage of eliciting relatively low error rates , participants in this new experiment performed both the flanker task and a time estimation task. in the latter error rates were manipulated to be approximately 50%. the current study focuses only on love withdrawal , and experimental sessions were conducted by experimenters not involved in the previous data collection. we expect that more love withdrawal will be related to more positive vpp amplitudes, as well as to more positive lpp amplitudes in response to disgusted compared to happy faces following erroneous responses.

RESULTS

discussion
maternal use of love withdrawal was significantly related to both vpp and lpp amplitudes in response to the facial feedback stimuli, partially confirming previous results. as expected, and as observed before
 <cit> , higher maternal use of love withdrawal was related to larger  vpp amplitudes. this result is again consistent with the expectation that those who experienced more maternal love withdrawal vigilantly focus on the facial stimuli as potential indicators of the relational consequences linked to failure and success. the finding that participants reporting relatively high maternal use of love withdrawal show heightened processing of emotional faces  thus appears to be robust.

maternal love withdrawal was also related to lpp amplitudes, but not in the way observed before. previous results were consistent with an attentional bias toward disgusted faces resulting from an association between performance and relational consequences established through the experience of love withdrawal. in our previous study, higher love withdrawal was related to more positive lpp amplitudes in response to disgusted compared to happy faces, specifically when faces were presented in red, i.e., after an error
 <cit> . however, in the current study higher love withdrawal was related to smaller  lpp amplitudes, regardless of feedback valence  or the facial emotion displayed . thus, whereas early processing of the facial feedback stimuli was enhanced , attentional engagement and processing at a later stage seemed to be diminished in those reporting higher maternal use of love withdrawal. because the current results regarding lpp amplitude did not confirm our previous findings, caution is warranted when interpreting these results. however, it is interesting that a pattern of enhanced early attention to and processing of salient social stimuli, followed by diminished attentional engagement and processing at later stages  has been suggested to explain attentional biases to threat in persons suffering from  anxiety disorders . we speculate that those who have experienced more maternal love withdrawal show, at least in a performance context, a similar vigilance-avoidance response toward emotional faces and/or performance feedback, as these are salient potential indicators of relational consequences linked to failure and success. alternatively, it might be the case that attentional engagement with and processing of the stimuli at later stages is needed less if early processing is enhanced, i.e., if more or all relevant information has been extracted at earlier stages of processing.

divergence in the outcomes of our two studies might be related to important differences in study design. in our previous study participants performed the flanker task during both experimental sessions, whereas two different tasks  were performed during the current study. although in the current study the effect of love withdrawal did not depend on the task performed, potential influences of task repetition  cannot be ruled out. in addition, our previous study focused on effects of oxytocin as well as maternal love withdrawal, and participants were administered oxytocin during one session and a placebo during the other. effects of love withdrawal on lpp amplitude were not moderated by oxytocin administration in that study
 <cit> . nevertheless, drug administration was an important component of the experimental context and absent from the current design. finally, the current study was limited by a small sample size , limiting the power to detect a complex 3-way interaction between love withdrawal, feedback valence, and emotional expression. as results regarding the lpp did not fully confirm earlier findings, future studies are needed to further elucidate the relation between experiences of maternal love withdrawal and lpp amplitude. in this respect, non-replications can be at least as useful as successful replications of earlier findings and help to move a field forward
 <cit> .

future studies could also address some of the limitations of the current study. first, neutral facial expressions should be included in future experiments to distinguish between the processing of faces in general and facial expressions in particular, which was not possible using our current experimental setup. furthermore, we measured maternal use of love withdrawal with a self-report questionnaire. there are obvious limitations to the accuracy and reliability of participants’ self-reports. lastly, our participants were all female. we chose to include only women to maximize the comparability of the current experiment to the one we conducted previously on an independent sample . that study included only women, because of the considerable differences between males and females in the oxytocin system
 <cit> , and because most of the studies on the behavioral or psychological outcomes of love withdrawal focus on maternal use of love withdrawal with daughters . nevertheless, it would be interesting to study the same processes in men. studies with mixed samples of males and females will facilitate a direct gender comparison, but these samples should be considerably larger to reach sufficient statistical power.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study aimed to contribute to the field by following up on previous findings. the current results partially confirmed previous findings relating experiences of maternal love withdrawal to the processing of emotional faces presented with performance feedback. the results indicated that whereas early processing of these stimuli is enhanced , attentional engagement and processing at a later stage are diminished in those reporting higher maternal use of love withdrawal.
