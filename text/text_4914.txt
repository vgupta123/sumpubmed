BACKGROUND
when any one single nucleotide of a, t, c and g in the genome sequence is replace by one of any other  <dig> nucleotide, e.g., from aaatccgg to aaattcgg, we call this single base variation  as a single nucleotide polymorphism . it has the following three characteristics  <cit> : 1) very common in the human genome ; 2)among the snps, two of every three snps are the variations from cytosine  to thymine ; 3) very stable from generation to generation. due to these characteristics, much research on snps has been developed, such as using snps to study the association of sequence variation  <cit>  and to do population classification  <cit> .

in association studies  <cit> , informative snps were usually selected based on certain correlation measures and therefore could represent other snps in the close proximity. for example, bafna et al.  <cit>  and halldrsson et al.  <cit>  proposed to select a subset of tag snps with the minimum size and highest informativeness value calculated from a self-defined informativeness measure, which evaluates how well a single snp or a set of snps predict another single snp or another set of snps within the neighborhoods. eran et al.  <cit>  proposed to select the informative snps with the maximum prediction accuracy, which is obtained from a prediction accuracy measure evaluating how well the value of an snp is predicted by the values of only two closest tag snps. phuong et al.  <cit>  proposed the method of selecting informative snps by removing redundant features. redundancy was measured by feature similarity between two features, i.e., the linkage disequilibrium  measure γ <dig>  <cit> .

in population studies, the selection of informative snps should be based on their population classification capability. related research, such as selecting genetic markers with highest informativeness for inference of individual ancestry  <cit> , selecting informative marker panels for population assignment  <cit>  and detecting ethnically variant snps  <cit> , has already been explored. rosenberg et al.  <cit>  proposed to use the informativeness for assignment  to measure the ability of each genetic loci or marker  to infer individuals' ancestry, which was proved to be similar to the f-statistics measure  <cit> . in  <cit> , rosenberg et al. proposed the univariate, greedy, and maximum algorithms to select marker panels. the three algorithms were realized through a given performance function, e.g., the optimal rate of correct assignment   <cit> , which measures the probability of correctly assigning an individual to the population from which the genotype of the individual has originated with the greatest possibility. the application of the algorithms on eight species was effective. very recently, park et al. developed a systematic approach based on nearest shrunken centroid  method  <cit>  to identify ethnically variant snps. according to  <cit> , they calculated a shrunken value for each snp of each class, and compared each snp's shrunken value for different classes to determine the snp's classification capability. the less the difference among the snp's shrunken values for different classes, the less important the snp for classifying the three different ethnic groups   <cit> , i.e., ceu, yri and jpt+chb.  <dig>  snps were obtained and the top  <dig> snps were able to completely classify the three populations.

in this paper, we propose to firstly rank snps according to a feature importance ranking measure, i.e., a modified t-test or f-statistics, where the higher the ranking value, the stronger the corresponding classification power. then, from the ranking list, we sequentially choose different numbers of top ranked snps, e.g.,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  ...,  <dig> and so on, test them through a classifier, e.g., the support vector machine   <cit>  and determine the snp subset which has the highes classification accuracy. this process is repeated  <dig> times. finally, we locate those important snps who always have top ranking values according to snp subsets obtained from  <dig> simulations.

RESULTS
the international hapmap project provides many kinds of data for researchers in  <cit> , such as the hapmap genotype data and the phased haplotype data. the phased haplotype data describes snp alleles on a chromosome inherited from one of father and mother, while the genotype data describes snp alleles on both chromosomes inherited from parents  <cit> . we give an example ) to describe the relationship between the haplotype and genotype. besides, the genotype data has missing values for some loci , while the phased haplotype data  has missing values filled by the well known genotype phasing tool phase  <cit> . therefore, we download the phased haplotype data from the directory of . the legend data and sample data in the directory are also necessary to describe locus places , locus names , and sample names . the hapmap data includes four populations: ceu, yri, jpt and hcb, where ceu represents utah residents with ancestry from northern and western europe; yri represents yoruba individuals from ibadan and nigeria; jpt represents japanese individuals from tokyo, and hcb means han chinese individuals from beijing. ceu and yri each has  <dig> related samples, i.e.,  <dig> father-mother-offspring trios. after removing the offsprings,  <dig> unrelated samples are obtained for ceu and also for yri. for jpt and chb populations, each of them has  <dig> unrelated samples. therefore, we obtain  <dig> unrelated samples for the experiment. since the hapmap project provides  <dig> separate populations and also  <dig> populations, we will do the classification on the 3-population and 4-population problems, respectively. the 3-population problem is the same as  <cit> .

combining all the features together from the  <dig> chromosomes, i.e., chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  ...,  <dig>  x , we have nearly  <dig> million snps involved in the experiment. for most features , their snp types  are expressed as bi-allelic snps, i.e., consisting of two single alleles from  <dig> nucleotides atcg. for example, if one snp consists of the two allels a and g ), all the possible feature values for this locus will be aa, ag and gg, in which aa and gg are called homozygous, and ag is called hyterozygous. since the phased haplotype data has two rows of haplotypes describing one individual, we transform the haplotype data into the genotype format ) for computational convenience. when transforming data from the haplotype format into the genotype format, we adopt two kinds of transformations considering different requirements of two algorithms ). for the modified t-test ranking measure, if simply transforming nominal values to normal numeric values and doing the calculation according to equation , it will be possible to lose the meaning of different snp types. we propose to use vectors to represent different snp types and rank them by the modified t-test ranking measure ). for example ), according to the description of the modified t-test ranking measure, "11" ) is represented by { <dig>   <dig>  1}, "00"  is represented by { <dig>   <dig>  0}, and "10"  is represented by { <dig>   <dig>  0}. as to the f-statistics ranking measure, since it involves the calculation of two single alleles for each bi-allelic snps, we will use  <dig> and  <dig> to represent the two different alleles, respectively. for example, given the same snp reference type a/g as the one in the modified t-test ranking measure, we use  <dig> to represent a and  <dig> to represent g. then, in each population we can calculate each allele's frequency and variation for each population, as well as those values for all the populations. each snp's f-statistics value is calculated from equation . at the same time, we notice some special conditions. for example, if one locus with reference snp type a/g only has the value aa for all the individuals, the frequency of the snp allele a will be 100% and the frequency of allele g will be zero. referring to equation , either p¯ or q¯ in the denominator will be equal to zero. in fact, this feature has no classification capability for any populations. therefore, we set the fst value of that feature as zero. in summary, the greater the numerator and the smaller the denominator in equation , the greater the value fst and the more important the corresponding feature for classification.

we have  <dig> simulations to conduct, i.e.,  <dig> different combinations of two rankings  and two classifications . from the  <dig> samples, we randomly choose  <dig> samples from yri and ceu, respectively, and  <dig> samples from jpt and chb, respectively, as the training set. the  <dig> samples left are used as the testing set. each simulation is repeated for  <dig> times.

we first rank the snps of  <dig> chromosomes, respectively. then we choose each chromosome's top  <dig> snps, combine the  <dig> features together, and rank them again. in this way, features involved in the experiment are greatly reduced and this also will not lead to loss of important information. on the contrary, it will improve the efficiency of the experiment.

in each of  <dig> simulations, we select top  <dig> snps from the ranking list and form  <dig> different snp subsets. the first subset consists of only the first top snp. the second subset is formed by adding the second top snp into the previous subset, the third top. subsequently, we evaluate all subsets through the classifier svm in terms of the classification accuracy. due to space limitation, we provide classification results of only  <dig> feature subsets, i.e., the subsets consisting of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps, respectively. table  <dig> is for the f-statistics ranking measure and table  <dig> is for the modified t-test ranking measure. intuitively, the classification on  <dig> populations produces higher accuracies than on  <dig> populations, for both ranking measures. this can be interpreted by the fact that the jpt and chb populations have very similar dna sequence and it is hence hard to discriminate between these two populations. when comparing classification results by the f-statistics ranking measure with those by the modified t-test ranking measure on  <dig> populations, we can see that mean accuracies produced by the latter are higher than those by the former for most snp subsets. the advantage of the modified t-test measure over the f-statistics measure is more obvious for  <dig> populations than for  <dig> populations. in addition, we provide the minimal and maximal accuracies for each of those  <dig> snp subsets in the  <dig> simulations for the two ranking measures in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. according to the results in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  we can see that complete classification on  <dig> populations is possible for the modified t-test ranking measure with appropriate snp subsets. whereas, there is always a little error  for the f-statistics measure with those  <dig> snp subsets.

in the following, we find the subset which leads to the maximal classification accuracy from the  <dig> snp subsets . we list the maximal classification accuracy in each of the  <dig> simulations, the number of snps that the relevant snp subset includes, and the mean values  in the  <dig> simulations. although the average number of snps that leads to the best classification is similar for both ranking measures , the mean classification accuracies produced by two ranking measures are different . the modified t-test ranking measure produces  <dig> % mean accuracy, which is  <dig> % higher than the accuracy produced by the f-statistics measure, i.e.,  <dig> %, for  <dig> populations. the mean accuracy produced by the modified t-test on  <dig> populations, i.e.,  <dig> %, is much higher than that produced by the f-statistics measure, i.e.,  <dig> %.

after determining the subset leading to the maximal classification accuracy in each of the  <dig> simulations, we need further determine what those snps are and which chromosomes those snps locate on. from the result in table  <dig>  we know there are on average  <dig> snps obtained for the desirable feature subset. because of space limitation, we will not list all those snps. for example, in table  <dig>  we list  <dig> snps whose appearance frequencies are greater than  <dig> % , mean ranking values and locations of these snps, using the f-statistics ranking measure on  <dig> populations. similarly, we present results obtained by the modified t-test ranking measure in table  <dig>  in which  <dig> top ranked snps whose appearance frequencies are greater than  <dig> % in the  <dig> simulations are presented. for both ranking methods, most of the snps come from chromosome  <dig> , except rs <dig> from the chromosome  <dig> , rs <dig> from chromosome  <dig>  and rs <dig> from chromosome  <dig> . among  <dig> snps in table  <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> appear  <dig> times in the  <dig> simulations. among  <dig> snps in table  <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> appear  <dig> times in the  <dig> simulations. interestingly, the mean ranking values of these snps with the highest appearance frequencies are not the highest.

all experiments are executed using matlab  <dig>  on a personal computer with windows xp operating system and pentium  <dig> cpu  and  <dig> ghz ram. we perform statistics about the running time of the two ranking measures together with the training and testing time. the mean time using the f-statistics to rank all snps of  <dig> populations is  <dig>  seconds, while on average  <dig>  seconds for the modified t-test ranking measures. it may be because that calculating the median value s <dig> makes the modified t-test ranking measure take more time than the f-statistics measure. both algorithms cost more time on  <dig> populations compared to  <dig> populations. the total training and testing time is  <dig>  seconds. in terms of classification accuracy, the modified t-test ranking measure is superior over the f-statistics measure. besides, the modified t-test ranking measure is proposed to deal with vector features and provides a way for ranking nominal features.

since features' ranking only indicates the relevance of each feature, those features with the same or close ranking values may have high correlation between each other, i.e., redundancy. therefore, it is possible for us to further reduce the number of snps in our future work.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we propose to use two feature importance ranking measures, i.e., the modified t-test and f-statistics, to rank large amount of snps, and then use the greedy manner together with a classifier to determine a desirable feature subset, which has the minimum size but leads to the highest classification accuracy. the final results show that both ranking methods are efficient on determining the importance of the snps. although the two ranking measures find nearly the same amount of snps, the modified t-test ranking measure tends to be better than the f-statistics measure in terms of the classification accuracy. compared to the classification method of park et al. <cit> , we obtain a better result, i.e., good classification of the  <dig> populations using fewer, i.e., on average  <dig>  snps.
