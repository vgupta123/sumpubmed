BACKGROUND
the brown planthopper , nilaparvata lugens, is a major pest to rice production in many areas of asia. it shows two wing forms, long  and short  ones, in its adult stage. the macropterous adults possess the ability to migrate across long distances, while the brachypterous adults exemplify strong reproductive capacities. one individual brachypterous female has the ability to produce a large number of offspring, increasing each generation size by 10- to 40-folds  <cit> . the macropterous adults migrate long distances every year to the rice-growing areas of china, japan and korea, resulting in severe infestations  <cit> , causing hopperburn and ultimately leading to reductions in rice yields. the bph ingests nutriments specifically from the phloem of rice plants with its stylet, causing whole plants to become yellow and rapidly dry, a phenomenon referred to as hopperburn  <cit> . in additional, bph is a vector for some rice diseases such as the rice ragged stunt virus  and rice grassy stunt virus   <cit> . bph often causes losses of up to 60% in rice crop yields  <cit> . in china, n. lugens covered areas totaling  <dig>  million hm <dig> in  <dig>  and in  <dig>  the affected area has increased to  <dig>  million hm <dig>  causing huge economic losses  <cit> . because insecticides have been extensively used to control this pest, resistances have begun to arise in different countries and areas  <cit> . this pattern of resistance causes ecological imbalances in predator-prey relationships and has often resulted in the resurgence of bph  <cit> . despite the extensive literature documenting the effects of host plant quality on the performance of herbivorous insects, surprisingly few publications have considered the fecundity of the bph.

the reproductive system of female insects consists of a pair of ovaries, ovarioles is the function units of the ovary containing a series of tapering egg tubes. there is a progression of developing oocytes in the ovarioles. the number of ovarioles in each ovary varies tremendously in different insect species and determines fecundity  <cit> . the n. lugens has 24- <dig> ovarioles per ovary in most individuals  <cit> .

the fork head  family transcription factors have several subclasses and members, designated as a to q  <cit> , and they share a structurally conservative fork head box defined by a 'winged helix' dna-binding domain  <cit> . the first fork head protein, foxa, was first found in d. melanogaster and importantly required in the embryonic development  <cit> . subsequently, several additional fox transcription factors have been described in various organisms  <cit> . it has been reported that fox transcription factors play critical roles in regulation of metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis, development, organogenesis, differentiation and control of oxidative stress through both activation and repression of target gene expression by multiple mechanisms  <cit> . in some insects, fox factors participate in the regulation of many physiological processes  <cit> . reports have attested that endocrine hormones play an important role in the development of ovaries  <cit> . several fox factors have been shown to be involved in regulating vitellogenesis, fecundity and ovarian events such as follicular development and selection, ovarian cell proliferation and cancerogenesis, ovarian cell apoptosis, ovarian secretory activity and oocyte/cumulus maturation  <cit> . however, whether foxa influences reproduction or not is still unknown.

rna interference  through double-stranded rna  has been used widely to study gene function in insects. since rnai was first discovered in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . rnai has extensively applied in ovarian function study  <cit> . many means of transporting dsrna into the body of an organism have been explored, including microinjection, soaking, oral feeding and transgenic plant expression  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that gene knockdown in several insects can be achieved successfully through feeding the insects bacteria that express dsrna  <cit>  or artificial diet containing dsrna  <cit> . directly feeding dsrna is a simple manipulation, inflicts no body injury and has been established for insect research.

the present study was designed to characterize and identify expression of the transcription factor foxa in hemiptera, n. lugens. we used rnai technique to knockdown expression of nlfoxa by feeding the insects an artificial diet containing dsrna. we also intended to provide evidences to confirm whether foxa influences reproduction of n. lugens and whether it is involved in fundamental biological phenomena and agricultural problems related to the bph.

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of nlfoxa cdna
based on the conserved sequence of fork head from t. castaneum, d. melanogaster and b. mori, a 434-bp cdna fragment was obtained by homologous cloning using cdna from the 2nd day of brachypterous female adults as a template. sequence analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the cdna fragment had 41-45% identity to the corresponding region of foxa from t. castaneum, d. melanogaster and b. mori. then, the 5'- and 3'-race were performed with two pairs of specific primers designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the cdna fragment. a full-length nlfoxa of  <dig> bp  was obtained by overlapping the race fragments and the cdna fragment. sequence analysis showed that the open reading frame  of nlfoxa is  <dig> bp, encoding  <dig> amino acid residues with a predicted mw of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> , and there is a 5'-untranslated region  of  <dig> bp and a 3'-utr of  <dig> bp . an 18-residue signal peptide at the n-terminus was identified by signalp, thus the mature protein  has a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and an estimated pi of  <dig> . blast searches using nlfoxa as a query showed that all the predicted foxa proteins, including nlfoxa, from insects and vertebrates contain only one fox dna-binding domain, indicating that nlfoxa belonged to the fox dna-binding superfamily. nlfoxa contained typical amino acids within the 110-aa-long fkh domain, suggesting that it encodes foxa  <cit> .

developmental and tissue specific expression of nlfoxa
to determine whether nlfoxa is present during developmental stages and in various tissues in the 3rd day of brachypterous female adult n. lugens, total rna of each sample was isolated. we used rt-qpcr and rt-pcr to characterize the pattern of developmental expression of nlfoxa gene for all developmental stages . the results demonstrated that nlfoxa mrna was expressed at constantly low levels with little change during developmental stages . a high level of nlfoxa expression was detected in the fat body, midgut, cuticle and the malpighian tube, but was not found in the ovary and thoracic muscle .

efficiency analyses after ingestion of dsnlfoxa
after feeding synchronous nymph groups on  <dig>  μg/μl nlfoxa dsrna, dsgfp and the blank control from the 3rd to the 5th instar , the survival rates were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. to investigate the efficiency of rnai after ingestion of ds nlfoxa in n. lugens, nlfoxa mrna relative levels were measured by rt-qpcr in brachypterous adults collected 1- <dig> days after emergence on rice plants.

the transcript levels of nlfoxa were decreased by  <dig> %- <dig> % from the emergence of brachypterous adults up to the 8th day of adults compared to the blank control . this result confirmed that rnai-mediated knockdown of nlfoxa was highly effective.

knockdown of nlfoxa or nlvg reduces fecundity and disrupts ovarian development
once insects emerged, we successfully allocated them into  <dig> pairs per group. the number of offspring from every individual brachypterous female adult was counted, and the result demonstrated that nlfoxa plays an important role in the reproduction of n. lugens. the average number of offspring in the group treated with  <dig>  μg/μl nlfoxa dsrna was  <dig> , significantly less than those in the control and dsgfp-treated groups . interestingly, knockdown of nlvg showed similar results to those of the nlfoxa knockdown .

although feeding dsnlfoxa reduced fecundity, the hatchability rate was unchanged . thus, we set out to determine whether ingestion of dsnlfoxa affects the development of ovaries by analysis of morphology. assessment of ovaries from the 3rd day of brachypterous adults suggested that rnai knockdown of nlfoxa resulted in underdeveloped ovaries with less ovarioles and fewer eggs. in contrast, the control and dsgfp-treated groups showed repletion and no disruption of ovarioles and eggs on the same day . similar results were obtained when nlvg was knocked down .

knockdown of nlfoxa results in lower vitellogenin  gene expression and less vg protein
vitellogenin is a conserved yolk precursor protein that is synthesized in the fat body in invertebrates, and the yolk provides nutrition to the developing oocytes for utilization during embryogenesis. we showed that expression of vitellogenin  gene  was significantly suppressed after ingestion of ds nlfoxa .

to detect vg protein in the ovaries of bph after different treatments, equal amounts of total proteins from three groups were coated to microtiter plates and assayed by indirect elisa  and western blotting  with corresponding primary antibodies. the vg protein concentration in ovaries of the 3rd day of brachypterous female adults treated with  <dig>  μg/μl nlfoxa dsrna was significantly lower than that of the control and dsgfp-treated groups. the increased concentration of nlfoxa dsrna was accompanied with a decreased concentration of vg protein . the putative vg bands were considerably more intense in the control and dsgfp-treated groups than in the nlfoxa dsrna-treated group, suggesting that nlfoxa regulates ovarian maturity by controlling accumulation of nlvg in the ovaries.

discussion
the brown planthopper fosters a robust ability to produce offspring. one brachypterous adult individual insect can produce more than  <dig> offspring  <cit> . this may be the primary cause of damage caused by pbh on rice plants in many areas of asia. it is commonly known that the macropterous pbh migrate from vietnam, which is considered the major source of the north-bound migration to china every year  <cit> . many factors can affect the fecundity of insects. host plant quality is a critical factor for herbivorous insects  <cit> . endogenous hormones and peptides are also significant components underlying successful reproduction  <cit> . in this study, we investigated how the transcription factor nlfoxa regulates fecundity and ovarian development in n. lugens. we first cloned and characterized a cdna sequence from the hemiptera insect n. lugens encoding foxa, which shares a high homology with the t. castaneum foxa. pattern analysis suggests that the expression level of foxa mrna in n. lugens was almost constant throughout the life cycle , this maybe because it regulates different physiological processes in specific development phases. the nlfoxa was expressed in the fat body, midgut, cuticle and the malpighian tubes, but was not found in ovaries and thoracic muscle . the foxa originates from endoderm and elongates to ectoderm during evolution  <cit> . in different insects, foxa is located in different tissues. in h. armigera, foxa was localized to the nuclei of fat body cells  <cit> , but in ae. aegypti, foxa was not expressed in fat body but in the thorax, midgut, and malpighian tubules  <cit> . in t. castaneum, it can be detected in yolk nuclei  <cit> . our successful cloning of nlfoxa not only adds a member to this family of transcription factors but also provides a potential target for the biological control of insect pests.

fox genes encode a family of transcription factors defined by a "winged helix" dna-binding domain and have been identified in many metazoans, and they play critical roles in regulating diverse physiological processes. in b. mori, stabilization of sgf1/fork head to its target sequence is critical to promote fhx transcription at each intermolt  <cit> . in d. melanogaster, fork head controls the timing and tissue selectivity of steroid-induced developmental cell death  <cit> . in h. armigera, foxa regulates the expression of diapause hormone  <cit> . in mammals, foxa genes play crucial roles in multiple stages of mammalian life, including early development, organogenesis and differentiation, metabolism and homeostasis  <cit> . fat body is a major tissue for vitellogenin synthesis during vitellogenesis  <cit> . studies in american dog tick indicated that vg uptake is essential for ovarian development  <cit> . dna-binding assays revealed that, in ae. aegypti, genomic dnas containing the 5' upstream region and the positions of regulatory and coding sequences of the mosquito vg gene are capable of binding to transcription factors  <cit> . several transcription factors have been reported to be involved in ae. aegypti fecundity, but the authors did not assess the effect on the reproduction because it is not a 'fat body' fox factor, and the elaborate mechanisms of these phenotypes were lacking  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that nlfoxa expression level was at a constant low level with little change. interestingly, downregulation of nlfoxa can suppress ovarian development in n. lugens  and quickly decrease the number of offspring . confirming this effect, the expression levels of nlvg mrna  and protein  were remarkably decreased. simultaneously, knockdown of nlvg had similar efficiency . in addition, nlfoxa is also expressed in the fat body syntopogenic with vg . foxa can bind to the promoters of diapause hormone and pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide to regulate their expression  <cit> . whether nlfoxa regulates nlvg by directly binding to regulatory elements, inducing hormone synthesis via the other pathway, or supporting the nutritional element of ovary development requires further deliberation.

rnai has been widely used to study gene function in insects. there are many approaches for delivering dsrna into an organism's body. it has been reported that gene knockdown in several insects can be achieved successfully through feeding dsrna. the oral delivery of an artificial diet containing dsrna to larvae of the lepidopteran species s. exigua not only suppressed transcription levels but also led to lethal phenotypes, and proved that sid- <dig> exists in s. exigua  <cit> . sid- <dig> is required for spreading rna-interfering information between tissues, usually leading to systemic rnai  <cit> . in a previous paper, we reported that the oral delivery of an artificial diet containing nltps dsrna can induce target gene silencing in n. lugens  <cit> . sid- <dig> has been found in n. lugens  <cit> , and nlfoxa gene is also expressed in the fat body. thus, oral delivery of rna interference can be achieved to knockdown target genes in n. lugens. further research will address how much dsrna is required to avoid degradation in the midgut and can reach the target tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the existence and characterization of a foxa gene in n. lugens, and have shown that oral ingestion of nlfoxa dsrna solutions by n. lugens nymphs resulted in decreased expression of the target gene, less fecundity and underdeveloped ovarian in the brachypterous adults via regulating vitellogenin expression.
