BACKGROUND
oriental persimmon  is distributed in the mountainous areas adjacent to the three provinces, hubei, henan and anhui, of central china  <cit> . according to the criteria established for persimmon cultivars, persimmon can be categorized into two major groups, pollination-constant nonastringent  type consisting of two subcategories, chinese pcna  and japanese pcna , non-pcna type consisting of three subcategories, pollination-constant astringent , pollination-variant nonastringent , and pollination-variant astringent   <cit> . the cpcna-type fruits are able to lose astringency naturally at ripening stage, thus justifying their significant value as commercial use. non-astringency is a discrete trait for the cpcna fruits, but is a quantitative trait for non-pcna fruits. the genetic trait of cpcna has been shown to be controlled by a single locus , which is dominant against jpcna  <cit> , implying that one half of the f <dig> offspring derived from crosses between cpcna and jpcna will generate pcna-type fruits  <cit> . therefore, persimmon cpcna cultivars hold great potential for breeding new cultivars of pcna type. however, limited information is available on the molecular mechanism underlying fruit astringency of cpcna persimmon. therefore, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying natural loss of fruit astringency in cpcna persimmon is of paramount significance for persimmon genetic improvement.

astringency of persimmon fruits is ascribed to the accumulation of tannins , which are biosynthesized via three main pathways through shikimate, flavonoid and pa  <cit> . a majority of genes in these pathways have been isolated, including pal, chs, chi, f3h, f3′5′h, dfr, ans, lar, and anr. expression patterns of these genes were analyzed in fruits of cpcna and jpcn persimmon, which showed that transcript levels of most genes were lower in jpcna than in cpcna from middle to late developmental stages  <cit> . in addition, dkpdc and dkadh were suggested to be associated with natural astringency loss of cpcna persimmon  <cit> . meanwhile, great progresses have also been achieved regarding elucidation of transcriptional regulation in recent years. for example, a basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor , dkmyc <dig>  was isolated from ‘luotian-tianshi’, a famous cpcna, which is proposed to control pa biosynthesis by regulating expression of dklar and dkanr through binding to relevant cis-elements on the gene promoters  <cit> . in another work, genome-wide transcriptome analysis of cpcna identified a number of tfs associated with pa biosynthesis, including  <dig> mybs, three bhlhs and two wd40s  <cit> . the pa monomers are transported to vacuoles through tt <dig> and tt <dig>  and then polymerized into polymeric pas catalyzed by lac  <cit> . however, it is worth mentioning that despite above-mentioned work on elucidation of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, the underlying molecular mechanisms of natural astringency loss remain largely elusive, and further in-depth analyses are required to dissect the mechanisms.

apart from transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation by micrornas  is also crucial for a number of physiological processes. the mirnas are a class of endogenous non-coding small rnas of 20– <dig> nucleotides . the biogenesis of mirna has been well documented. first, long single-stranded primary mirnas  are generated from the intragenic regions of nuclear-encoded mir genes by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . then, the pri-mirnas are transcribed in nucleus to generate 100–200 nt precursor mirnas  with stem-loop structures  catalyzed by dicer-like i enzyme , yielding a duplex intermediate   <cit> . after addition of a 5′ 7-methylguanosine cap by huaenhancer <dig>   <cit> , the rna duplexes are translocated into cytoplasm by hasty, a plant protein orthologous to exportin- <dig>  <cit> . finally, the mature mirna strand is integrated with rna-induced silencing complex , whereas the mirna* strand is usually degraded  <cit> . the risc is then incorporated with agronaute proteins  and functions to regulate target gene expression through cleaving the target mrna, leading to repression of mrna translation  <cit> . in plants, most mirnas can perfectly complement with their mrna targets, while the single recognition site is predominantly present in the mrna coding region rather than in the 3-untranslated region   <cit> . plant mirnas have been predicted or validated to regulate genes encoding various types of proteins that play pivotal roles in many biological processes  <cit> .

currently, two main approaches are usually applied to study mirnas, computational prediction using ests or genomic sequences and next generation sequencing-based techniques  <cit> . given that the computation-based approach is restricted to discovering conserved mirnas and that genomic information of persimmon is scarce thus far, the second approach may be more suitable for deciphering mirnas in persimmon. in this study, deep sequencing using illumina gaii was applied to identify both conserved and novel mirnas that are possibly implicated in fruit astringency of ‘eshi no. 1’ persimmon . stem-loop quantitative real-time rt-pcr   <cit>  was employed to validate the expression level of a set of mirnas. in addition, identification and characterization of mirnas and their target genes were established using bioinformatics prediction in combination with 5′-race.

RESULTS
determination of pa contents in persimmon fruits
imprinting method was used to determine soluble tannin levels in ‘eshi no. 1’ fruits. the sections were deeply stained at the beginning of fruit development , when the fruits were small in size. with the progression of development, the fruits grew quickly and became increasingly big until reaching the largest size at  <dig> waf . the fruits were still darkly stained until  <dig> waf, but the staining began to turn lighter at  <dig> waf. at the last experimental stage,  <dig> waf, the fruits were only slightly stained .figure  <dig>

to confirm the imprinting results, quantitative measurement of soluble and insoluble tannin contents in the fruits was carried out using the folin-ciocalteu method. the soluble tannin in the fruits was  <dig>  mg/g fw at  <dig> waf, but quickly decreased at  <dig> waf , followed by a slight change at  <dig> waf. however, a sharp decrease of soluble tannin in the fruits was observed between  <dig> and  <dig> waf, changing from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/g fw. the tannin level in the fruits at  <dig> waf  was only slighted decreased compared with that of  <dig> waf . at the last stage, soluble tannin accounts for less than  <dig> % of the fruit weight, implying that the fruits at this point have already lost their astringency  <cit> . the insoluble tannin, remarkably less than the soluble tannin, was decreased to the lowest level  from  <dig> to  <dig> waf, but progressively increased thereafter, reaching the peak value  at  <dig> waf, followed by a minor decrease at  <dig> waf . total tannin contents in the fruits followed the trend of soluble type during the whole developmental stage .

as the soluble tannin underwent the greatest change between  <dig> and  <dig> waf, and the insoluble tannin increased to the largest amount during this stage, the fruits at these two stages were selected for mirna sequencing in the subsequent work.

sequencing of small rna libraries using illumina platform
to identify persimmon mirnas, two small rna  libraries were constructed using fruits collected at  <dig> and  <dig> waf, and subjected to deep sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained at  <dig> and  <dig> waf, respectively. after removing low quality sequences, adapters, poly-a sequences and small sequences shorter than 12 nt,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads and  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  unique sequences were finally generated . the srna data have been deposited in ncbi , under the accession number of srp <dig> table  <dig>

as composition of small rnas reflects their different roles in specific functions  <cit> , we investigated length distribution of the small rnas in the two libraries. the results demonstrated that the majority of mirnas ranged from  <dig> to 25 nt in length, in which small rnas of 24 nt were most abundant in the two libraries, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . in order to get a clear view of sequence annotation, the small rna reads were searched against rfam  <dig>   database, which revealed that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the sequences at  <dig> waf and  <dig> waf, respectively, can be annotated to non-coding small rnas . however, only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the mirnas accounting for the total srnas were identified in the two libraries .figure  <dig>

identification of known and novel mirnas
the sequences were searched against mirbase v <dig> , in which mirnas from  <dig> plant species have been deposited  <cit> . after alignment, a total of  <dig>  mirnas were obtained, in which  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were unique to the  <dig> waf and  <dig> waf libraries, respectively, while  <dig> mirnas were present in both libraries . length distribution analysis showed that most of the known mirnas were clustered in the 21-nt type . we then analyzed nucleotide bias at each position so as to understand whether the cleavage sites of mirnas had specific features for mirna  <cit> . about  <dig> % of the mirnas had uridine  at their first nucleotide position, but resistance to guanine  was observed at the first position. by contrast, positions between  <dig> and  <dig> were resistant to u. we also found that the tenth nucleotide, a position determining the cleavage site, had a strong preference for adenosine  . due to different cleavage sites of dcl enzymes and some other factors, additional or missing nucleotides may exist at the end of mature mirnas, especially at the 5′ end  <cit> . we also noticed that different from 21-nt mirnas, the first position of 24-nt mirnas showed a strong preference for a .figure  <dig>

the small rnas with at least seven reads in one of the two libraries were used to search the database, which gave rise to  <dig> known mirnas in the two libraries. after family analysis, these known mirnas were found to belong to  <dig> mirna families, in which  <dig> families have one member. the largest mirna family is mir <dig> composed of  <dig> members, followed by mir <dig> with  <dig> members .

expression analysis was performed based on normalized read counts for each mirna family. it showed that mirna abundance was different among the  <dig> known families. the highly conserved mirnas, such as mir156/mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were expressed abundantly. the most abundant mirnas were mir <dig> and mir <dig>  with  <dig>  and  <dig>  tpm  in the two libraries, respectively. however, non-conserved mirnas, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were expressed at relatively lower levels .

based on the criteria for selecting differentially expressed mirnas, including |fold change| >  <dig> and p-value <  <dig> ,  <dig> out of the  <dig> known mirnas were identified to exhibit different expression levels between  <dig> and  <dig> waf. among the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas,  <dig> were up-regulated, whereas  <dig> were down-regulated, in the fruits at  <dig> waf in comparison with those at  <dig> waf , in which  <dig> showed a two-fold or greater  change. of note, the members in families of dka-mir <dig>  dka-mir <dig>  dka-mir <dig>  and dka-mir <dig> were only up-regulated, whereas those of dka-mir <dig>  dka-mir <dig>  dka-mir <dig>  dka-mir <dig>  dka-mir <dig>  dka-mir <dig>  dka-mir <dig>  and dka-mir <dig> were all down-regulated.table  <dig>

after excluding known mirnas and rfam annotation, the remaining sequences were used to discover novel and potential persimmon-specific mirnas, which revealed that a total of  <dig> mirnas were predicted to be potentially novel. secondary fold structures of precursors for the  <dig> novel mirnas were analyzed . seven out of the  <dig> mirnas were shown to have complementary mirna* sequences . in order to test the reliability of novel mirna prediction, five novel mirnas  were amplified and sequenced, in which four were completely consistent with those of deep sequencing, while only mirn <dig> was slightly different due to insertion of one nucleotide . most of the novel mirnas were found to exist at low copies, with the exception of dka-mirn <dig>  dka-mirn <dig>  dka-mirn <dig>  dka-mirn <dig>  dka-mirn <dig>  which possessed more than  <dig>  reads . furthermore,  <dig> novel mirnas were shown to be differentially expressed during fruit development, in which  <dig> were up-regulated, but  <dig> were down-regulated, at  <dig> waf .table  <dig>

validation of the mirna expression by stem-loop qrt-pcr
stem-loop qrt-pcr, which is a reliable method for assessing mirna expression levels, has been applied for experimental verification of the mirnas  <cit> . for this purpose, we analyzed expression of  <dig> mirnas, including  <dig> randomly selected known mirnas  and  <dig> novel mirnas with relatively high expression levels  were largely consistent with the results of deep sequencing except dka-mir156a, dka-mirn <dig>  and dka-mirn <dig>  which displayed opposite profiles between the two methods.figure  <dig>

prediction of putative target genes for the known and novel mirnas
putative target genes for all of the known mirnas were searched using psrnatarget. a total of  <dig> potential mirna-target pairs were identified  from a transcriptome of ‘eshi no. 1’ composed of  <dig>  persimmon unigenes  <cit> . a number of the mirnas have multiple targets, indicating the diversity of these mirnas. the potential targets of known mirnas were either conserved or non-conserved among different plants . most of the predicted targets in this study were found to encode transcription factors . for example, mir <dig> was revealed to target squamosa promoter-binding protein-like   <dig> and  <dig> of spl family. auxin response factor   <dig> and  <dig> were found to serve as the targets of mir <dig>  mir <dig> was shown to target cycloidea and pcf transcription factor  <dig>  in additions, several tfs in the families of basic helix-loop-helix , growth-regulating factors , and myb were predicted to act as targets of mir395p-3p, mir396d and mir858b, respectively. interestingly, dka-mir396g targeted a gene encoding flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase. in addition, some mirnas targeted genes involve in disease resistance and stress response. for example, mir <dig> was found to target tir class protein, while zinc finger  family protein and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase were predicted targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively.

in addition, targets of the novel mirnas were also predicted using the same strategy as that for the known mirnas.  <dig> out of the  <dig> novel mirnas can be successfully predicted to have their targets, which encode either transcription factors or functional genes that are involved in an array of processes, such as flower development, metabolism, and stress response . for example, mirn <dig> and mirn <dig> were predicted to target gras and ap2/b3-like tfs, respectively. some target genes were shared by different novel mirnas; for instance, nadh dehydrogenase was the target of mirn <dig> and mirn <dig>  by contrast, a few novel mirnas can target different genes; mirn <dig> was predicted to regulate plant invertase and pectin methylesterase inhibitor superfamily gene.

to better understand regulatory roles of the identified mirnas, we performed go analyses on target genes of the differentially expressed known mirnas . among the  <dig> target genes,  <dig> were categorized into biological processes,  <dig> into cellular components and  <dig> into molecular functions . the major biological processes were ‘cellular process’ and ‘metabolic process’, such as go: <dig> and go: <dig>  the main cellular components were ‘cell’ and ‘cell junction’, such as go: <dig> and go: <dig>  as for molecular functions, the majority of genes were clustered into ‘binding proteins’ and ‘catalytic’, such as go: <dig> and go: <dig>  the target genes regulated by the up-regulated mirnas encode transcription factors , whereas most of the targets regulated by the down-regulated mirna were shown to take part in leaf development , shoot system development , response to hormone stimulus , and hormone-mediated signaling .figure  <dig>

time-course expression dynamics of mirnas and target genes
in order to gain insight into the potential involvement of the mirnas in astringency, time-course expression profiles of four known mirnas  during fruit development were investigated using stem loop qrt-pcr. transcript level of dka-mir156j-5p was very low at  <dig> waf, sharply increased to the maximum value at  <dig> waf, followed by a prominent decrease at  <dig> waf. then, the expression level was maintained constant at  <dig> waf and decreased to undetectable level at the last time point . as for dka-mir858b, the highest transcript level was detected at  <dig> waf, which decreased continuously thereafter and reached the lowest level at  <dig> waf, followed by a slight elevation at  <dig> waf . the mrna abundance of dka-mir395p-3p began to accumulate at  <dig> waf, and sharply increased by nearly  <dig> folds at  <dig> waf, then progressively increased to the highest level at  <dig> waf. at  <dig> waf, the transcript level was reduced to the level of  <dig> waf . the mrna abundance of dka-mir2911a was decreased to the minimum at  <dig> waf, then slightly increased at  <dig> waf, but remarkably increased to the highest expression level at  <dig> waf, followed by a minor reduction at the last stage .figure  <dig>

in addition, expression profiles of mgb_c <dig>  and mgb_c <dig> , two target genes regulated by dka-mir395p-3p and dka-mir2911a, respectively, were also analyzed using the same set of materials as mentioned above. transcript level of mgb_c <dig> was shown to be extremely high at the first stage of fruit development, but underwent a marked and steady decrease at  <dig> and  <dig> waf, when the expression level was barely detected. mgb_c <dig> was then up-regulated at  <dig> waf, followed by a noticeable reduction at the last stage . mgb_c <dig> was induced from  <dig> to  <dig> waf, but decreased steadily between  <dig> and  <dig> waf, when the lowest expression level was observed. at the last time point, transcript level of mgb_c <dig> was again elevated .

verification of mirna-guided cleavage of target genes by 5′-race
two target genes, mgb_c <dig>  and mgb_c <dig> , were examined using 5′-rna ligase-mediated race  in order to confirm whether the target prediction was accurate. two mismatches were observed between the amplified product of mgb_c <dig> and mi396d. in addition, cleavage of mgb_c <dig> primarily occurred at the tenth position of the mirna sequence . mgb_c <dig> displayed three mismatches compared with the sequence of dka-mir395p-3p. meanwhile, the cleavage was found to occur predominantly at the ninth position of the mirna sequence .figure  <dig>

discussion
it has been well documented that mirnas act as important regulatory factors that play pivotal role in a variety of biological processes, such as plant growth and development, morphogenesis, embryogenesis, stress tolerance, and metabolism  <cit> . within the last years, enormous progresses have been made to explore mirnas in several fruit trees, such as citrus, grape, apple, and peach  <cit> . however, the information concerning mirna identification in persimmon is still limited compared to those identified in other fruit trees. therefore, identification and characterization of mirnas in persimmon will provide valuable knowledge for us to understand relevant regulation machinery pertinent to a specific process, such as astringency.

in this study, we applied a solexa sequencing platform for in-depth characterization of mirnas in ‘eshi no. 1’, an oriental persimmon that can lose astringency naturally on trees. about  <dig> million raw reads were obtained from the two libraries. the percentage of 24-nt srnas was much higher than that of 21-nt srnas. this finding is consistent with the results on tomato  <cit> , but different from that of trifoliate orange  <cit> , suggesting that distribution of srnas with different length may vary among plants. however, this may also be ascribed to sequencing or samples used for studies. as 24-nt srnas have been reported to function in heterochromatin modification, especially for genomes with a high content of repetitive sequences, the current study suggests that the srnas might play diverse roles in various processes of persimmon  <cit> .

based on the sequences available in the mirbase database and transcriptome data,  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas have been identified from the libraries constructed using the persimmon fruits at two stages, when the soluble tannin underwent substantial reduction. plant mirna families have been classified into highly conserved, non-conserved and specific mirnas  <cit> . in this study, we detected several highly conserved mirna families, such as mir <dig>  mir159/mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which exhibited relatively abundant tpm in the persimmon libraries. this corroborates the proposition that these mirnas serve as core mirna families that are possibly ancestors of mirnas in all land plants  <cit> . however, we also noticed that several other core mirna members were not detected in this study, consistent with an earlier work with prunus  <cit> . three mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  have been reported to be highly conserved among fruit trees  <cit> ; but we could only detect mir <dig> in persimmon. all of these findings seem to suggest that persimmon has not only conserved mirnas as those previously reported, but also has its own set of mirnas, which may be ascribed to the unique features of this plant in comparison with others.

in the current study,  <dig> out of the  <dig> known mirnas were significantly differentially expressed in the fruits at the two examined stages, in which  <dig> were up-regulated at  <dig> waf, and  <dig> were down-regulated. it is assumed that some, if not all, of the differentially expressed mirnas might play key roles in regulating pa synthesis during persimmon fruit development. interestingly, the differentially expressed mirnas include several candidates, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  that have been reported to regulate pa synthesis in other plants. mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been reported to regulate biosynthesis of pas in apple and arabidopsis thaliana, respectively  <cit> . in our study, mir <dig> was down-regulated at  <dig> waf, exhibiting a pattern similar to the change in soluble tannin content, implying that it may positively regulate the target genes involved in biosynthesis of pas in persimmon. by contrast, mir <dig> was dramatically up-regulated  at  <dig> waf, suggesting that it may act as a negative regulator of pa synthesis in persimmon. meanwhile, mir <dig> might be another crucial mirna for influencing pa synthesis as it is predicted to target genes associated with anthocyanin synthesis  <cit> . in addition, we also noticed that several differentially expressed mirnas, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  displayed dramatic fold changes between the two stages. whether these mirnas play roles in regulating pa synthesis remained to be investigated.

bioinformatics comparison of sequence homology between mirnas and gene sequences, a traditional approach for unraveling target genes in plants  <cit> , demonstrated that  <dig> potential targets were successfully predicted for the mirnas. consistent with previous reports, a number of the targets in persimmon were also shown to encode transcription factors, including spls, arfs, grfs, bhlhs, and mybs. moreover, some target genes are shown to be involved in stress response, while others are implicated in a wide range of biological processes, implying a complexity of the mirnas in the regulation of biological processes. we also noted that the novel mirnas targeted different genes with a variety of functions, such as flower development , disease resistance , and metabolism  . all of these data suggest that the mirnas are implicated in the regulation of genes associated with multiple processes during fruit development.

pas are important secondary metabolites for determining the quality of persimmon fruits. pa biosynthesis shares the same upstream pathway as anthocyanins, both of which have been well characterized. accumulating data suggest that regulation of the anthocyanin pathway largely depends on the interaction between r2r <dig> mybs, bhlhs and wd40s  <cit> . this interaction may also play a role in the orchestration of the subset of genes associated with pa biosynthesis. in this regulatory machinery, myb proteins may play a predominant role in activating the structural genes. various members of r2r <dig> myb family may exhibit different and separate regulatory impacts on the biosynthesis of end products in the flavonoid pathway branches leading to anthocyanins, flavonols, and proanthocyanins  <cit> . a number of earlier studies report that myb genes might be regulated by various mirnas  <cit> . interestingly, in the current study we also detected a myb-targeting mirna, dka-mir858b, whose expression dynamics followed the same trend as the change in soluble tannins during fruit development, implying that dka-mir858b might be positively correlated with pa biosynthesis. this finding suggests that dka-mir858b may control a myb protein that plays a negative role in regulating pa synthesis. this speculation is plausible as a few mybs acting as repressors have been reported in earlier studies, such as famyb <dig> of strawberry and vvmyb <dig> of grape, although most mybs behave as positive regulators to govern the expression of structural genes  <cit> . however, more work is needed to characterize the myb gene regulated by dka-mir858b. apart from myb, we also found that a bhlh protein was predicted to be targeted by dka-mir395p-3p, which was experimentally verified using 5′-rlm-race. the expression pattern of dka-mir395p-3p was precisely opposite to that of the bhlh gene, providing another line of evidence supporting the reverse regulation. moreover, expression profile of the bhlh gene was largely concordant with the fluctuation of tannin, except the last time point, suggesting that dka-mir395p-3p/bhlh regulation might be involved in the regulation of pa synthesis. spl has been documented to act as one of the mir <dig> targets in earlier work  <cit> . in our study, we discovered a differentially expression mirna, dka-mir156j-5p, which was predicted to target spl. strikingly, dka-mir156j-5p was down-regulated to extremely low abundance with the ripening of fruits , implying that spl might be abundantly expressed during the late stages of fruit development. spl has been reported to destabilize the myb-bhlh-wd <dig> complex, which in turn leads to repression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and inhibits anthocyanin accumulation  <cit> . in this regard, it is assumed that the stability of myb-bhlh-wd <dig> complex might be increasingly impaired with the extension of fruit development. this causes an adverse effect on the activation of the structural genes pertinent to the flavonoid pathway, leading to lowered pas biosynthesis.

it has been documented that the metabolites derived from different enzymatic reactions form trans- or cis-flavan-3-ol units, such as  <dig>  3-trans--catechin and  <dig> - cis--epicatechin  <cit> , which are the precursors of pas. they are generally glucosylated by 3-o-glucosyltransferase, thus facilitating transportation to vacuole and polymerization  <cit> . therefore, the gene/enzyme responsible for glucosylation is critical for pas biosynthesis. in the study, dka-mir396g was revealed to target flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase gene. transcript abundance of dka-mir396g was down-regulated in the fruits at  <dig> waf in comparison with those of  <dig> waf. this implies that expression of 3-o-glucosyltransferase gene might be enhanced when fruits ripened, which in turn leads to accelerated glucosylation and facilitates the transportation of precursors.

in this study, the soluble tannin was decreased with the ripening of persimmon fruits, whereas the insoluble counterpart was increased. growing evidences demonstrate that pas insolubility is a critical factor responsible for loss of astringency in persimmon fruits  <cit> . conversion from soluble into insoluble tannin, especially at the late stage of fruit development, requires the participation of acetaldehyde, which is formed in situ from ethanol with a catalytic reaction mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase  and pyruvate decarboxylase  <cit> . interestingly, an adh-targeting mirna, dka-mir2911a, was acquired in the sequencing data. of note, expression pattern of dka-mir2911a was perfectly inverse to that of the adh gene, which, however, exhibited a trend same as the change in the insoluble tannin. therefore, we speculate that dka-mir2911a played an instrumental role in promoting insolubility of tannin by regulating adh gene at the late stage of fruit development.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, through high throughput sequencing we identified  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families, and  <dig> novel mirnas in persimmon. of the identified known mirnas,  <dig> were shown to be differentially expressed during fruit development,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. some of the differentially expressed mirnas were predicted to target an array of genes that have been previously reported to be involved in synthesis, transportation and insolubility of pas, all of which are limiting factors associated with pa accumulation. based on our data and earlier studies, we propose a model on deastringency of cpcna by integrating the identified mirnas in the pas biosynthesis pathway . of the mirnas, mir395p-3p and mir858b regulate bhlh and myb, which work in synergy to regulate the structural genes responsible for pa biosynthesis. however, towards the fruit ripening, mir156j-5p/spl regulates the stabilization of myb-bhlh-wd <dig> complex, leading to decreased pas production. however, transportation of the pas to vacuole is expedited when pa precursors were glycosylated by flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase, which is targeted by mir396g. finally, soluble tannin was converted to insoluble part in the vacuole through acetaldehyde produced from ethanol oxidization mediated by adh, which is under the control of mir2911a, in particular at the late stage of fruit development. the identification of these mirnas paves way for elucidating the post-transcriptional regulation of astringency in persimmon. in the future, extra work is required to functionally characterize the identified mirnas and verification of their direct targets that are tightly involved in the regulation of pas accumulation and deastringency of cpcna.figure  <dig>
