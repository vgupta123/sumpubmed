BACKGROUND
c. elegans is a model organism that has been widely used for biomedical research, shedding light on diseases such as alzheimer  <cit>  and cancer  <cit> . the genome of this hermaphrodite nematode species was the first one published of a multicellular animal  <cit>  and its assembly and annotation is arguably one of the best of the multicellular organisms available today. the c. elegans reference genome sequence corresponds to the n <dig> strain, which was obtained from mushroom compost in bristol, england, and later provided by ellsworth dougherty to sydney brenner in  <dig>  <cit> . c. elegans populations can be found worldwide in north africa, europe, north america, australia and islands such as hawaii and madeira  <cit> . even though most c. elegans genetic studies have used the n <dig> background, the genetic and phenotypic differences of c. elegans among populations as found in different habitats has encouraged researchers to explore the natural variation of the nematode  <cit> , which can be directly applicable to the understanding of human variation  <cit> . genetic studies among different local  <cit>  and global populations  <cit>  have demonstrated that there is a low genetic diversity of this selfing species. this genetic diversity is 20× lower than that of d. melanogaster <cit>  or other obligately outcrossing members of the same genus  <cit> , and comparable to that of human populations  <cit> . in general, the genetic diversity found within local populations is very close to that found among individuals located in different continents, with a likely explanation being the anthropogenic nature of c. elegans together with a metapopulation dynamics of bottlenecks and recolonisation of the habitat  <cit> .

a strain that has been found to be one of the most genetically distant to the n <dig> strain is cb <dig>  <cit> , which was isolated in  <dig> from a pineapple field in hawaii  <cit> . in contrast to other isolates, this strain presents a large number of polymorphisms that are not found in any other populations  <cit>  and it has been used in surveying mutations and studying natural selection in evolution  <cit> , albeit allelic differences are likely to exist due to domestication during laboratory maintenance  <cit> . the considerably large number of polymorphisms found genome-wide  made of this strain a good resource for gene mapping  <cit> . lately, a new method based on confirmed snps between the cb <dig> and n <dig> strains, called snp-cgh mapping, has been proposed for the mapping of phenotypic traits  <cit> . also, n <dig> and cb <dig> backgrounds have been used for the generation of genetic tools such as recombinant inbred lines   <cit> , recombinant inbred advanced intercrossed lines   <cit>  and nearly isogenic lines   <cit> .

in addition to the usefulness of the polymorphic nature found between cb <dig> and n <dig>  these two strains present a number of differences in biological and behavioural traits such as copulatory plug formation  <cit> , intake of o <dig> and co <dig> <cit> , temperature-size rule  <cit> , germline rnai  <cit> , response to benzaldehyde  <cit> , thermal migration  <cit> , pathogen susceptibility  <cit> , biofilm resistance in the presence of yersinia <cit> , and social behaviour and food response  <cit> . understanding the molecular basis of these and other biological differences is invaluable for annotating genes in c. elegans, which is a popular model organism for biomedical studies. for example, a missense mutation in gene npr- <dig> is associated with differences in the response to co <dig> and o <dig> <cit> , social behaviour and food response  <cit>  and susceptibility to pathogens  <cit> . other examples are an early stop codon in ppw- <dig> gene, which is associated with differences in germline rnai  <cit> , a missense mutation in tra- <dig> gene, associated with differences in the temperature-size rule proper of ectotherms  <cit> , the disruption of gene plg- <dig> by an ltr-retrotransposon in the n <dig> background, associated with differences in copulatory plug formation  <cit>  and the deletion of an exon in gene glb- <dig>  associated together with npr- <dig> with differences in the intake of o <dig> and co <dig> <cit> . although many lesions responsible for the phenotypic differences have been found, other known traits that present differences, such as the egg-laying behaviour or response to odorants  <cit>  don’t have an identified genetic basis. additionally, genes that don’t present genetic differences may also be associated to differences in traits by, for example, changes in gene dosage in one strain over the other due to epigenetic alterations.

whole genome sequencing  and resequencing of c. elegans strains using second-generation technologies have gained increasing popularity as a fast and cost-effective method for understanding the genetic differences among wild isolates  <cit> , laboratory strains  <cit> , mutant strains  <cit> , and mutation-accumulation  lines for the study of mutational processes that lead to deleterious mutations  <cit>  as well as fitness recovery through beneficial compensatory mutations  <cit> . in particular, no study has focused so far on the genome-wide genetic differences between the cb <dig> and n <dig> strains based on wgs using second-generation sequencing technologies. still, previous studies based on oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization  have reported large copy number differences between these two strains  <cit> , estimating that ~2% of the genes in the hawaiian strain are deleted compared to the n <dig> strain. the oacgh approach has a number of drawbacks, such as a limited resolution for the length of the indels, no base pair level breakpoint resolution for the indels detected, bias towards exonic regions of unique dna content, and false positives in regions with a high content of snps and small indels, where hybridization of the probe is not possible. overcoming these drawbacks is essential for a clear and thorough understanding of the genomic differences between the hawaiian and the n <dig> strain, since most of the genetic basis of phenotypic variants have been found to be small variations  and there are previous reports of highly polymorphic regions impacting both exonic as well as non-exonic segments of the c. elegans genome  <cit> .

in this study, we have sequenced the cb <dig> genomic dna using roche/ <dig> and illumina ga platforms. we show that the combined approach in which the strengths of both sequencing methods are used for the detection of gvs provides an accurate way of detecting single nucleotide variants  and small insertions and deletions  in highly variable and homopolymeric regions, as well as a basepair-level resolution of the detection of large deletions, insertions and compound variations. we also assessed the impact of all gvs on protein-coding genes by carefully considering all co-occurring gvs on a given transcript as well as the nature of the genes involved. we have not attempted to identify copy number variations between n <dig> and cb <dig> in this study.

RESULTS
to identify genomic variations  between the genome of the n <dig> strain of c. elegans  and the hawaiian strain , we have sequenced the cb <dig> genome using the roche  <dig> genome sequencer flx system  <cit>  and illumina ga. the rationale behind this is that both sequencing technologies provide complementary strength: on the one hand,  <dig> reads provide the length necessary to detect large gvs such as insertions and deletions that cannot be found within the alignment of a read, but between two aligned segments  of a same read; on the other hand, illumina reads provide the necessary coverage for reliably detecting snvs and small indels. also, as shown below, the length of  <dig> reads proves useful for detecting snvs and small indels in highly variable regions, for which the alignment with illumina reads is not feasible.

roche  <dig> genomic dna sequencing
our computational procedure for the identification of gvs based on  <dig> reads consists of two steps. first, the  <dig> , <dig> reads obtained with  <dig> were aligned to the c. elegans reference genome  using the smith-waterman-based program cross_match . the reads have an average length of  <dig> base pairs  , and the alignment on the c. elegans reference genome achieves a 4× median depth. most reads  are aligned with a single hsp, which may contain snvs as well as small insertion/deletions . still, a large number generated two or more hsps , which suggests that larger gvs are occurring in addition to the snvs and small indels within each hsp.

to take full advantage of the long  <dig> reads for identifying gvs, we developed and applied our variation discovery program called variationblast . using variationblast we categorized  <dig> , <dig> reads as unique and  <dig>  reads as non-unique . the remainder  <dig>  reads did not generate any alignmnents, which could be explained by sequences specific to the hawaiian genome or to hypervariable regions. based on the unique reads reported by variationblast, we detected snvs, small indels, large insertions, deletions and compound variations .

illumina solexa genomic dna sequencing
the detection of gvs based on illumina reads for the hawaiian strain was done as follows. first, the  <dig> , <dig> illumina reads  were aligned in a paired-end manner  against the ws <dig> release of the c. elegans genome using ssaha <dig>  <cit> . of these,  <dig> , <dig> reads  were mapped to the genome, generating a median depth of 67×. second, based on this alignment, varscan  <cit>  was used to detect snvs and small indels. those reads that mapped only partially to the genome  were used as input to detect large deletions in the same manner done with  <dig> reads .

identification and assessment of snvs
the strategy based on  <dig> reads and variationblast yielded  <dig>  snvs  whereas that based on illumina reads and varscan yielded  <dig>  snvs . additionally, wormbase ws <dig> lists  <dig>  snvs . merging the three datasets generates a total of  <dig>  snvs , after excluding  <dig> snvs due to inconsistencies in the nucleotide variant between two or among all datasets . as expected due to its deep coverage, illumina reads contribute for the vast majority  of the total snvs .

inspection of the  <dig> aligned reads on those coordinates that are specific to illumina-snvs shows that they are missed by  <dig> due to low coverage  and due to conflicting reads at the same sites. further analysis of snvs specific to 454-snvs shows that many fall into highly variable regions that don’t allow for an alignment with illumina reads and ssaha <dig> . this is a valuable contribution of the length of the  <dig> reads to the detection of snvs, since otherwise these regions would be seen as gaps in the hawaiian genome compared to the reference.

the other explanation found for those snvs that are unique to  <dig> is that they are supported by illumina reads, but are discarded either by the minimum read coverage or by the variant frequency threshold. this latter reason also applies to snvs specific to ws <dig>  of the  <dig>  total snvs, transitional substitutions are slightly more frequent than transversional substitutions , which is expected and consistent with previous observations in caenorhabditis <cit>  as well as other species  <cit> . although the majority of the detected snvs fall in non-coding regions , a large number of them  fall within protein-coding exons or splice junction sites, suggesting that snvs have a huge potential to impact the structure and function of protein-coding genes . we also assessed the impact of snvs on individual spliced forms because same snvs can have differential impact on different spliced forms of a same gene. altogether,  <dig> snvs belong to two or more categories by impacting different spliced forms differently. for example, the snv in coordinate v: <dig>  generates a missense substitution for spliced form c47a <dig> a but a non-sense mutation for spliced form c47a <dig> b. for  <dig> of these snvs, the difference between spliced forms of a same gene corresponds to a synonymous snv in one spliced form that is also missense in another spliced form.

interestingly, more than half of the snvs in protein-coding exons are non-synonymous , suggesting that some regions of the genome are undergoing strong positive selection . for those snvs that fall within protein-coding exons, there is a bias for snvs in the third position compared to the first and second position . also, the occurrence of snvs is higher in the arms of the autosomal chromosomes compared to the center, with a rather uniform pattern for the x chromosome, as shown in the genomic distribution of snvs illustrated using the software circos  <cit>  . these observations are in agreement with previous studies on the genomic architecture of c .elegans n <dig> based on strain comparisons  <cit>  as well as inter-species comparisons  <cit> .

from figure 3a we can observe that the left arm of chromosome ii and chromosome iii as well as both arms of chromosome v have the highest density of snvs. unexpectedly, and in addition to these large regions in the arms of chromosomes, two smaller regions in the center of chromosome v spanning ~ <dig> kbp each  and one region in the center of chromosome iv spanning ~ <dig> kbp  also have a very high density of snvs. inspection of these regions shows that these are mostly chemosensory genes , which have been demonstrated to be actively evolving  <cit> . in fact, chemosensory genes are among the most rapidly evolving genes in caenorhabditis species, as demonstrated by comparative analysis of chemosensory gene families  <cit> .

one-third of all c. elegans genes  contain one or more missense snvs, whereas  <dig> genes  carry one or more non-sense snv. non-sense snvs accumulate preferentially in the 3′ end of the coding sequence , suggesting that many genes containing non-sense snvs might still be functional. in contrast, missense snvs distribute rather uniformly along the coding sequence . the large number of non-synonymous snvs suggests a significant impact on protein-coding genes for this type of gv.

in order to evaluate the potential functional impact that missense snvs have on protein-coding genes, we examined, for each corresponding amino acid substitution, the associated grantham score   <cit> . this score predicts the difference between two amino acids in terms of composition, polarity and molecular volume. based on the categorization provided by  <cit> , the differences can be regarded as: radical , moderately radical , moderately conservative  and conservative . based on this, we find that  <dig> % of the amino acid substitutions can be regarded as radical ,  <dig> % as moderately radical ,  <dig> % as moderately conservative  and  <dig> % as conservative . taking together the percentage of radical and moderately radical substitutions, approximately  <dig> in  <dig> substitutions are predicted to generate an important change on protein structure, and hence likely function.

identification and assessment of small indels
in this project, small indels are defined as insertions and deletions that cause gaps in local sequence alignments obtained using cross_match, for  <dig> reads , or ssaha <dig>  <cit>  when aligning illumina reads. using  <dig> reads and variationblast, we found  <dig>  small indels  whereas with illumina reads and varscan we found  <dig>  small indels . additionally, wormbase ws <dig> provides  <dig>  small indels .

merging of the three datasets generates a total of  <dig>  small indels , after excluding  <dig> small indels due to inconsistencies in sequence among datasets . as expected due to its deep coverage, and as it was observed for snvs, illumina reads contribute for the majority  of the total small indels. the overlap between illumina and  <dig> is much lower for indels than for snvs . inspection of indels unique to one platform reveals two main reasons for this discrepancy. first, the majority of the illumina-indels are found adjacent to homopolymeric regions . since sequencing of homopolymers is a known issue for  <dig> reads  <cit> , small 454-indels within such regions were filtered out by our methodology for homopolymers of length 5 bps or larger. the high presence of small indels in homopolymeric regions have also been reported previously for the pasadena strain  when comparing it to the n <dig> strain  <cit> . this finding further illustrates the importance of sequencing the hawaiian genome with both  <dig> and illumina methodologies; in addition to the sensitivity gained with  <dig> reads for highly variable regions, the accuracy of illumina reads at homopolymeric regions greatly improves the detection and estimation of the number of small indels, which would have been greatly underestimated otherwise. the second source of disagreement between these datasets is that different strategies for alignment of reads have an impact on the upper threshold for what is regarded as a small indel. for 454-indels, their length distribution goes up to 39 bps, whereas for illumina-indels their length distribution goes up to 13 bps only . additional reasons for uniqueness of illumina-indels, 454-indels and ws210-indels are in close agreement with those found for snvs.

the total small indels range in length from 1–39 bps, have a median of 1 bp, and the majority fall outside of exonic regions . for those indels of length 2 bps or larger, there is a higher frequency of those that don’t generate frameshift compared to those that do, which is not observed for small indels that fall in non-exonic regions . this suggests that small indels that do not cause frameshifts on protein-coding genes are more tolerated through evolution than those that do.

still,  <dig>  genes  are impacted by small indels, with  <dig> genes  having their orf disrupted, in many cases at the 3′ end of their coding sequence . this suggests, in the same way as for snvs, that many genes containing disruptive small indels might still be able to keep their functionality.

the frequency of indels is higher in the arms of the autosomal chromosomes compared to the centres . in contrast, the distribution of small indels is rather uniform on the x chromosome. in general, there is a striking agreement between the distribution of snvs and indels, including those regions with a high frequency of mutations in the center of chromosome iv and chromosome v that contain mostly chemosensory genes.

next, we describe the identification of large deletions, insertions, and compound variations. since different patterns of aligned reads were observed, we have defined different types of insertions and compound variations .

identification and assessment of large deletions
we defined large deletions as genomic sequences revealed as gaps between adjacent and co-linear aligned segments . we identified large deletions using  <dig> reads and variationblast on the hsps generated with cross_match . compared to the reference genome, we found  <dig> deletions in the hawaiian genome . applying the same idea on illumina reads  we found  <dig>  deletions in the hawaiian genome compared to the reference . merging of the two datasets generates a total of  <dig>  large deletions , with  <dig> of the  <dig> large deletions obtained with  <dig> reads confirmed by illumina large deletions . hence, the procedure defined with cross_match and variationblast on illumina reads identified  <dig> % of the total large deletions. as expected, large deletions found with  <dig> but not with illumina are due to thresholds on the maximum depth allowed within the deletion as well as the minimum number of supporting reads ; large deletions found with illumina but not with  <dig> are mostly due to low coverage with  <dig> 

the  <dig>  large deletions have a median length of 85 bps, and range from 4 bps to  <dig>  bps in length, with  <dig> deletions  equal or larger than 100 bps in length, and  <dig> deletions  equal or larger than  <dig>  bps. the majority of these deletions  fall in regions without protein-coding exons, with  <dig> deletions impacting  <dig> protein-coding genes . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are entirely deleted ,  <dig> are truncated ,  <dig> genes have preserved orf , and  <dig> gene  has one spliced form with its orf preserved  whereas the other spliced form has its orf disrupted . an example of a gene fully deleted in hawaiian is f42a <dig> , which has homology to human brca <dig>  associated with breast cancer. this deletion, of  <dig>  bps in length, is experimentally confirmed .

close inspection of the length distribution of large deletions reveals two peaks at lengths  <dig>  and  <dig>  bps . since such peaks can be indication of transposon activity, we performed a blastn search  <cit>  of these deleted sequences against the repbase  <dig>  library for c. elegans <cit> . all  <dig>  bps deletions yielded matches with e-value < 1e- <dig> for mariner2_ce, whereas all  <dig>  bps deletions yielded matches with e-value < 1e- <dig> for tc <dig>  two mariner/tc <dig> elements. in order to assess the overall impact of transposon activity on the large deletions, we ran blastn of all deleted sequences against repbase  <dig> , searching for hits with evalue < 1e- <dig> and not allowing for differences between the length of the deletion and that of the transposable element to be larger than 10% of the length of the transposable element. in this way we found  <dig> large deletions ranging from 193 bps to  <dig>  bps to be explained by transposable elements .  <dig> of these large deletions are larger than  <dig>  bps, explaining  <dig> % of deletions larger than  <dig>  bps.

identification and assessment of large insertions
a striking advantage of using the roche/ <dig> sequencing method compared to other second-generation dna sequencing methods that generate shorter reads is the potential to identify insertions in the target genome with breakpoints defined at the base pair resolution, as demonstrated in the watson genome analysis  <cit> . although paired-end reads generated using other second-generation dna sequencing methods such as illumina can be used to estimate the existence of insertions, the exact breakpoints are not defined. since the detection of insertions is limited by read length, we define and identify large insertions of various sizes by examining the nature of unaligned segments between hsps generated using cross_match.

if an unaligned portion of a read is flanked by two hsps of the same read, then it is annotated as a type-a insertion . these insertions are shorter than the read length, with their exact length, content and breakpoints readily defined. we identified  <dig> type-a insertions in the hawaiian genome ranging from 12 bps to 288 bps in length, with a median length of 56 bps . of these insertions,  <dig>  are equal or larger than 100 bps in length. the majority of these  <dig> type-a insertions  fall in regions without protein-coding exons, with only six insertions impacting six protein-coding genes . evaluation of these six insertions on the impacted protein-coding genes shows that two of them preserve orf , whereas the other four disrupt the orf , preferentially at the 3′ end of the sequence, with exception of y43f8c. <dig> whose disruption occurs in the first half of the coding sequence.

the limitations imposed by the read length for detecting large insertions drove us to define a separate strategy. if the flanking regions of two or more convergent reads are not aligned to the genome, then these unaligned flanking regions might represent the 5′ and 3′ ends of a putative large insertion . we call this putative insertion a type-b insertion. as type-a insertions, the breakpoints of type-b insertions are clearly defined at the base pair resolution. however, in contrast to type-a insertions, type-b insertions are of unknown length and content without further assessment. compared to the reference genome, we detected  <dig> type-b insertions in the hawaiian genome . the majority of these insertions  fall in regions without protein-coding exons, with seven insertions affecting seven protein-coding genes .

there are two complementary approaches for defining the sequences of the type-b insertions. first, the unaligned reads can be assembled into contigs. assembled contigs are then compared and aligned with the flanking regions of the insertion sites for the identification of insertions. unfortunately, the assembly provided with the roche/ <dig> sequencing didn’t prove useful for this purpose, likely due to a short contig length . alternatively, we can examine the detected type-b insertions experimentally by pcr amplification of these insertions. we confirmed  <dig> candidate type-b insertions and identified the lengths of these insertions as ~400 bps, ~500 bps, and ~ <dig>  kbp . as expected, these type-b insertions are much larger than even the largest type-a insertion found, of 288 bps in length, and also to those large insertions found in the watson genome  <cit> , for which the largest insertion is 208 bps in length based on 250 bps  <dig> reads.

compound variations
in addition to the events described above involving insertions and deletions, we have found a large number of variations with a co-occurrence of insertions  and deletions at the exact same breakpoints. we thus distinguish them from the previously described “simple” large insertion and deletion events and define three main categories of compound variations:  deletions associated with type-a insertions, when the deletion is equal or larger than the type-a insertion at the same breakpoint ,  type-a insertions associated with deletions, when the type-a insertion is larger than the deletion at the same breakpoint  and  type-b insertions associated with deletions, when there is a type-b insertion pattern for which the convergent reads are at a distance larger than zero .

compared to the reference genome, we found  <dig> deletions associated with type-a insertions in the hawaiian genome . these deletions have a median length of 106 bps, and range from 11 bps to  <dig>  bps in length, with  <dig> deletions  equal or larger than 100 bps in length, and  <dig> deletions  equal or larger than  <dig>  bps. the associated insertions range in length from 1 bp to 311 bps, with a median length of 8 bps, and  <dig> insertions are equal or larger than 100 bps. the majority of these deletions  fall in regions without protein-coding exons, with  <dig> deletions affecting  <dig> protein-coding genes . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are entirely deleted,  <dig> are truncated with some coding region deleted in the hawaiian genome,  <dig> preserve the orf and one gene, c29f <dig> , is such that its ‘a’ and ‘c’ spliced forms are fully deleted, whereas its ‘b’ spliced form has the orf disrupted.

when the inserted sequence is larger than the deletion, we call it a type-a insertion associated with deletion. compared to the reference genome, we found  <dig> type-a insertions associated with deletions in the hawaiian genome . these insertions have a median length of 65 bps, and range from 13 bps to 358 bps in length, with  <dig> type-a insertions  equal or larger than 100 bps in length. the associated deletions range in length from 1 bp to 339 bps, with a median length of 11 bps. the majority of these type-a insertions with their associated deletions  fall in regions without protein-coding exons, with  <dig> of these variations impacting  <dig> protein-coding genes ,  <dig> of them resulting in a disrupted orf, and  <dig> of them having their orf preserved. manual inspection of the sequences inserted and deleted within these compound variations suggests that some of them correspond to small duplications at the breakpoints .

in addition to the deletions associated with type-a insertions and vice versa, we also found  <dig> type-b insertions associated with deletions in the hawaiian genome . as stated before, the type-b insertions detected in this work have no known content or length without further experimental assessment, but they are expected to be large insertions. the associated deletions range in length from 1 bp to 383 bps, with a median length of 17 bps. the majority of these type-b insertions and their associated deletions  fall in regions without protein-coding exons, with  <dig> of them impacting  <dig> protein-coding genes . we selected and confirmed experimentally  <dig> candidates, providing inserted sequences ranging in length from 100–800 bps, with a particular case of a  <dig> kbp insertion  in the hawaiian genome. in addition to the cases validated for “simple” type-b insertions, these further prove the validity of this approach for detecting large insertions.

impact of gvs on protein-coding genes and loss-of-function mutations
the detection of snvs, insertions and deletions between the hawaiian strain and the n <dig> reference strain makes evident the huge disruptive potential that these gvs have by themselves on protein-coding genes. furthermore, hundreds of genes are simultaneously impacted by two or more of these gvs . hence, if the impact of gvs on the functionality of protein-coding genes is to be analysed accurately, then all co-occurring gvs should be considered. we used our newly developed tool coovar  <cit>  to explore the disruptive potential of all gvs. in particular, we assessed the impact of co-occurring snvs, small indels, large deletions, type-a insertions, type-a insertions associated with deletions and deletions associated with type-a insertions on all protein-coding genes annotated for c. elegans release ws <dig>  gvs involving type-b insertions were not included as they are of unknown content and length. after running coovar, we found  <dig>  genes, corresponding to  <dig>  spliced forms, impacted by some kind of gvs . of these,   <dig> genes are fully deleted ,   <dig>  genes have a disrupted orf ,   <dig>  genes contain radical or moderately radical snvs ,   <dig>  genes are impacted by gvs other than synonymous snvs  and   <dig>  genes are impacted by synonymous snvs . within this last category,  <dig>  genes were found to be under purifying selection  while only a single gene of unknown function  was found to be under positive selection .

possible loss-of-function mutations
in order to understand the potential functional impact of the gvs in the hawaiian strain, we divided impacted genes into three  categories :  it is a single-copy gene ,  it has a reported severe phenotype including lethality, sterility, sickness, developmental arrest, or other severe defects as detected by rnai or genetics studies , and  it is orthologous to a human gene with omim annotation. protein-coding genes in the first two categories can be regarded as essential. genes that in addition map to human genes with associated diseases  are highly conserved genes and good candidates for further genetics studies on deleterious alleles carried by individuals using c. elegans as a model organism.

numbers in parenthesis correspond to the total spliced forms affected. ‘orf disrupted’ includes frame shift gvs, stop loss and gains, and gvs impacting splice sites. ‘orf impacted’ considers all types of gvs except synonymous snvs.

overall, we found that 22%  of the  <dig>  c. elegans genes impacted by some kind of gv other than synonymous snvs are single-copy genes, with  <dig> genes  presenting severe phenotypes . furthermore,  <dig> genes  map to human orthologs that are associated with diseases. this set of genes, which are interesting candidate mutations that should be verified by cdna sequencing and genetic methods, provides a rich basis for understanding how healthy individuals of a same species can carry deleterious mutations on genes that can be considered essential for the organism.

table  <dig> also shows that the number of essential and omim genes decreases as the predicted impact of gvs increases . for example, of the  <dig> genes fully deleted, there are no genes falling into all three categories.

in contrast to the  <dig> genes found fully deleted in the hawaiian strain compared to the n <dig> reference, there are  <dig>  genes with their orf disrupted. of these,  <dig> genes are single-copy, with  <dig> having associated severe rnai or genetic phenotypes  based on ws <dig>  interestingly,  <dig> single-copy genes  have as homologs human genes with omim annotations .

since transcripts can be impacted differently, each transcript is listed. the location of the disruption is measured with respect to the length of the peptide as described in wormbase for n <dig> strain. sequence names with a ‘*’ indicate genes associated with severe phenotypes as defined in the text.

protein-coding genes with orf preserved could see their functionality significantly reduced if a deletion removes a functional domain. based on ws <dig> domain annotation, we found  <dig> genes with a deletion that overlaps at least partially with an annotated domain. gene y49f6a. <dig> is an example of a deletion that has a full and a partial domain removed while having its orf preserved. it encodes a  <dig> aa protein, translation initiator factor 2c . this protein has two domains: a paz domain  and a piwi domain . all residues between  <dig> and  <dig> aa are deleted, removing the paz domain and most of the piwi domain. a previous study on feeding of dsrna for rnai across different wild isolates of c. elegans <cit>  found that the hawaiian strain had a defect in germline rnai as a result of multiple mutations in a gene ppw- <dig> that contains the same domains. ppw- <dig> in the hawaiian strain has a 1 bp deletion that introduces an early stop codon upstream of the paz and piwi domains. thus the function associated to y49f6a. <dig> may be silenced in the hawaiian strain due to the loss-of-function mutations.

a third category of impact on protein-coding genes in addition to genes fully deleted and genes disrupted  refers to the presence of radical or moderately radical amino acid substitutions, according to the categorization provided by li and colleagues based on grantham scores  <cit> . these types of substitutions may have a significant impact on protein structure and hence function. there are  <dig> single-copy genes with such gvs,  <dig> of which are associated with severe phenotypes. of course, the categorization based on grantham scores can only serve as guideline for assessing the impact of missense snvs on protein-coding genes and cases that are not regarded as radical by such categorization can still have a significant impact on genes. for example, a previous study  <cit>  has shown that the molecular basis for the hawaiian strain not following the so called temperature-size rule  corresponds to a transition from a to g on a dii-a domain of gene tra- <dig>  generating a mutation from phenylalanine to leucine; this amino acid substitution is regarded as conservative by li’s categorization.

based on the set of single-copy genes with radical snvs presenting severe phenotypes, we have selected and validated experimentally four radical snvs by pcr amplification followed by dna sequencing .

impact of gvs on multi-gene families
the impact of gvs on protein-coding genes can be significant not only by impacting single-copy genes, but also by impacting multiple members of a same gene family. we explored how the four different levels of impact on protein-coding genes defined above affect different gene families . since there are many gene families, only those  <dig> most disrupted with at least  <dig> members are shown here, whereas the complete list can be found as . in general, the gene families most impacted by gvs are those involved in protein-protein interactions and sensory mechanisms such as the math/btb , fbox  and chemoreceptor genes.

in this study we have chosen to compare two wild isolates of c. elegans: the n <dig> strain, isolated from bristol, england in the 1950s by l.n. staniland  <cit>  and the cb <dig> strain, also known as the hawaiian strain, extracted from a pineapple field in hawaii in  <dig>  <cit> . these two strains present a number of differences in biological and behavioural traits including copulatory plug formation  <cit> , intake of o <dig> and co <dig> <cit> , temperature-size rule  <cit> , germline rnai  <cit> , response to benzaldehyde  <cit> , thermal migration  <cit> , pathogen susceptibility  <cit> , biofilm resistance in the presence of yersinia <cit> , and social behaviour and food response  <cit> . as well, other studies have shown no differences for other traits, such as sensitivity to supplemental zinc  <cit> .

combined strength of long  and short  reads
we have sequenced the cb <dig> strain using roche/ <dig> and illumina ga platforms. alignment of the reads against the n <dig> reference strain and subsequent detection of gvs reveals hundreds of thousands of snvs and small indels, and thousands of large deletions and insertions.

detection of snvs and small indels by these two different platforms demonstrated its complementary power; whereas illumina ga provides a significant depth  useful for resolving many snvs and small indels, the length of  <dig> reads allows for the detection of these gvs in highly polymorphic regions. such regions were known to exist between these two strains from previous studies  <cit> , justifying our decision of sequencing this genome with those two platforms.

even though there is an overall good agreement of snvs and small indels found in this study and those available in wormbase  <cit> , the high presence of small indels in homopolymeric regions generates a large disagreement between illumina ga and the roche/ <dig> sequencing technologies. homopolymers are a known issue for the roche/ <dig> platform specially for runs of 7 bps or larger  <cit> . a previous study on the genomic distribution of homopolymers in c. elegans reported close to  <dig>  such regions of 8 bps or larger, with a chromosomal distribution that resembles that found for small indels in this study, i.e., a higher accumulation in the arms of autosomes  <cit> . we have observed snvs and indels occur more frequently in the arms of autosomes than the center and more uniformly distributed in the x chromosome. gene density is a likely factor that contributes greatly to the observed pattern where a greater gene density is found in the central cluster while it is more gene sparse in the arms  <cit> . the greater gene density in the centre of the chromosome would also have more essential genes  <cit> . the presence of higher essential gene content provides a selective pressure against mutations. on the other hand, x chromosome is known to contain very few essential genes  <cit>  which could explain the more uniform snv and indels pattern.

in addition to snvs and small indels, we have found  <dig>  large simple deletions in the hawaiian genome compared to the n <dig> reference genome,  <dig> large deletions associated with type-a insertions,  <dig> type-a insertions associated with deletions,  <dig> type-b insertions and  <dig> type-b insertions associated with deletions.

advantage of dna sequencing-based methods for detecting gvs over cgh
a previous survey of deletions in the cb <dig> genome using oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization  predicted  <dig> deleted regions in the hawaiian genome compared to the n <dig> genome  <cit> . these deletions  represent a 2% of the c. elegans gene set and range from 219 bps to  <dig>  kbp in length . close inspection of these deletions shows that the majority  of the  <dig> nidf deletions are confirmed in this study; for all of these  <dig> nidf deletions we are able to define breakpoints at the base pair resolution . interestingly, for  <dig> of these  <dig> confirmed deletions we did not find a pattern of breakpoints as expected from the large simple deletions or the deletions associated with insertions. instead, a pattern of non-unique reads aligning at the boundaries of these deletions suggests that they are generated by a non-allelic homologous recombination  event .

in a previous study, we reported a 108 kb segmental duplication to be polymorphic among different laboratory strains  <cit> . during that study we also tested the hawaiian strain for the presence of such duplication, revealing that it was absent. inspection of the aligned reads to the genomic region harbouring the duplicons confirms the model stated in our previous work, where the duplication event was generated by nahr .

we have found that  <dig> of all  <dig> nidf deletions are likely false positives. almost all  of these false positive deletions are caused by the very high incidences of snvs within the genomic regions, which inhibit successful hybridization of probes designed based on the reference n <dig> genome sequences .

it is worth mentioning that close inspection of the nidf deletions showed that many of them are likely partially false positives due to the high presence of snvs and small indels that co-occur with true deletions, generating an overestimation of the deleted regions in the hawaiian strain. this, together with the likely false positives described above, explains why, whereas there is a very good agreement on the gene families most impacted in the hawaiian strain by our study and that of maydan and colleagues  <cit> , the number of deleted members per family in their study is much higher than in our case.

also, compared to the oacgh, which relies on dna hybridization, our approach using sequence alignment not only defines the exact deletion boundaries at base pair resolution, but also detects deletions in regions such as those containing ncrna genes , intronic/intergenic regions  and those of duplicative nature  such as transposable elements, that we have shown represent a significant part of the large deletions found in this study. also, small deletions  are not reported by the oacgh study, which, as we have seen, are the most prevalent. hence, the number and impact of deletions across different regions of the genome is much more significant than previously reported.

variationblast and larger gvs
in addition to large deletions, in this study we have provided a successful methodology for the detection of large insertions based on convergent reads at the same breakpoint. these insertions, which we call type-b insertions to distinguish them from the type-a insertions that can be found within the length of the reads, are of unknown content and length without further computational detection based on assemblies or directly through experimental molecular techniques such as pcr. attempts to detect larger insertions are necessary for a more accurate estimation of the gvs; for example, an accurate analysis of the activity of transposable elements  between these two strains would only occur if all the instances of insertions of any length in the hawaiian genome were to be found.

we have validated experimentally three type-b insertions and eight type-b insertions associated with deletions, with one extreme case of a 10 kb type-b insertion associated with deletion found in the hawaiian genome compared to the reference n <dig> genome. since the length and content of type-b insertions are not known, we did not include them as part of the overall impact of gvs on the protein-coding genes.

interestingly, of the seven type-b insertions impacting seven protein-coding genes, two are unique genes  based on ws <dig>  furthermore, gene y51a2d.7b displays phenotypes of sterility and embryonic lethality in rnai trials  <cit> . in the same way, the deletions of the  <dig> type-b insertions associated with deletions impact  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which are single-copy and one of which sdz- <dig> has an associated severe phenotype  <cit> . these results suggest that the gvs involving type-b insertions could still have detrimental consequence in the hawaiian worm.

confirming known gvs associated with trait differences
there are multiple previous studies that have shown behavioural and biological traits that are different between the n <dig> and the cb <dig> strains. many of these differences have an identified genetic basis. for example, a missense mutation of g > t at coordinate x: <dig> , <dig> in gene npr- <dig> generates an f215v codon change . this mutation has been associated with differences in the response to co <dig> and o <dig> <cit> , social behaviour and food response  <cit>  and susceptibility to pathogens  <cit> . results from a recent study on the origin of the 215 v allele, suggest that this allele arose during laboratory domestication of the n <dig> strain  <cit>  and hence would not be an actual difference between the wild n <dig> and hawaiian isolates.

table  <dig> provides a summary of reported gvs between cb <dig> and the n <dig> strain, the genes implicated and the difference in trait, if applicable. as shown in the table, we confirm most of the gvs reported. still, some gvs are not necessarily found by our pipeline but are confirmed after inspection of the affected regions. for example, the reported deletion of an exon for gene glb- <dig> in the hawaiian strain compared to the n <dig> strain presents a clear pattern of a nahr-based deletion . this deletion is associated with differential responses to co <dig> and o <dig> <cit> .

in the case of gene ppw- <dig>  associated to differences in germline rnai  <cit> , there are  <dig> gvs reported:  <dig> snvs, one 3-bps insertion and one 1-bp deletion. the deletion generates a truncation of the protein short after its occurrence. still, one of the reported variations downstream of that truncation, a snv that generates a k777e codon change, is not found by our pipeline. close inspection of the aligned reads shows that this snv occurs in a non-unique region , and since our pipeline focused only on the detection of gvs on reads uniquely aligned, then this gv was missed. finally, another type of non-unique region, a repeat at the boundaries of the deletion spanning an ltr-retrotransposon within plg- <dig>  associated with differences in copulatory plug formation  <cit> , doesn’t allow for the immediate detection of the deleted ltr-retrotransposon  with our pipeline.

these three examples  clearly illustrate that non-unique regions, even though challenging given the uncertainty of their duplicative nature, may contain important information regarding the impact of gvs on protein-coding genes can be missed.

a case that we could not confirm at the breakpoint resolution is the deletion associated with zeel- <dig> <cit> , also listed in table  <dig>  this gene is found in a highly divergent 62 kb region spanning  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> in chromosome i . still, there is a ~19 kb region spanning gene zeel- <dig> , in agreement with the work of seidel and colleagues. the excessive number of snvs and other small indels at the breakpoints of the deletion suggests that some gaps might actually be regions so divergent that local alignment of a segment of a read is not possible, and hence two hsps of a same read cannot be put together to report the large deletion.

notably, a recent study by the bargmann and kruglyak groups  <cit>  have shown that a deletion on a non-coding region of gene tyra- <dig> is associated with differences in decision-making in c. elegans ; this result, which could not be found with strategies like the oacgh, demonstrates the importance of detecting gvs genome-wide, and not only on protein-coding genes.

possible loss-of-function mutations
in addition to those studies that have reported a genetic basis for differences in traits, there are many reported differences between these two strains for which the genetic basis remains undefined. these include differences in response to benzaldehyde  <cit> , thermal migration  <cit>  and biofilm resistance in the presence of yersinia <cit> . inspection of our detected gvs and their impact on protein-coding genes can shed light on the molecular basis that generates such differences. one example has to do with the response to benzaldehyde. a previous study shows that, after exposure to benzaldehyde in the absence of food, n <dig> displays a decreased attraction to that odorant whereas cb <dig> fails to display decreased response  <cit> . we find that one single-copy gene, gpc- <dig> , which presents a benzaldehyde chemotaxis defective phenotype based on an rnai experiment  <cit> , and carries a radical missense snv at coordinate x: <dig> , <dig>  that generates a c12r codon change. this radical snv might have a significant impact on the structure and function of the protein associated to gpc- <dig>  and hence it is a good candidate for further studies that explore the genetic basis of the differential response to benzaldehyde.

in addition to the contribution that this dataset of discovered gvs might have on differential traits with unknown genetic basis, we expect our dataset of detected gvs to be a contribution to those traits that might already have an explained genetic basis but for which further discoveries can be found, such as the deletion of the paz and piwi domains in the elf-2c reported earlier in this study, which might also be contributing to the differences in germline rnai in addition to the truncation of ppw- <dig>  overall, we expect the set of gvs found in this study to be useful for further pursuing the genetic basis of these and other behavioural and biological trait differences between n <dig> and cb <dig> 

several single-copy genes that have their orf fully deleted or disrupted in cb <dig> compared to n <dig> have also an associated severe rnai or genetic phenotype . we have found  <dig> genes with such features that are either fully deleted  or have an orf disrupted . furthermore, we found  <dig> genes  that present those features and that are impacted by some kind of gvs . if a gene that can be regarded as essential for a leaving organism is truncated, then the natural question is how is it possible that a healthy individual carries a mutation that is likely deleterious. such apparent inconsistencies have also been observed in human individuals, for which current efforts of the  <dig>  genomes project have shown that there are at least  <dig> loss-of-function  variants in the genome of a healthy human individual  <cit> . one explanation for such cases can be duplication events involving the genes in the hawaiian strain compared to n <dig>  this could be addressed by exploring the depth of the aligned reads compared to an average; an analysis of differences in copy-number based on read coverage goes beyond the scope of our study. another explanation might be that we are dealing in many cases with a genetically complex system for which mutations in two or more genes balance each other, resulting in the preservation of fitness of the individual.

CONCLUSIONS
our work confirms previously identified gvs associated with differences in behavioural and biological traits between the n <dig> and cb <dig> strains and provides a rich resource for future studies that aim to explain the genetic basis for other trait differences.
