BACKGROUND
cells possess several mechanisms to control the quality of their components, such as proteins  <cit> . one of these mechanisms ensures proper folding and function of proteins, sending misfolded proteins to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and represents the best characterized protein quality control process  <cit> . in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum , one relevant protein quality control mechanism operates, where misfolded proteins are recognized by er chaperones and some of them are eventually translocated to the cytosol, in the interface with the er membrane. finally, the degradation of non-functional proteins can take place by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in a process known as er-associated degradation   <cit> .

the importance of protein quality control mechanisms is evident if it is taken into account that as much as 30% of all nascent polypeptides are misfolded  <cit> . e <dig> ubiquitin ligases are associated with ribosomes to degrade proteins with aberrant folds, which mean that several proteins can be degraded during translation  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that several mutants of genes encoding critical proteasome subunits are lethal. remarkably, accumulation of misfolded proteins is implicated with several human diseases, especially neurodegenerative illnesses that are associated with protein aggregates  <cit> .

proteins that enter the secretory pathway are directed to the er, where their folding and post-translational modifications occur. however, when the processing capacity of the er is overwhelmed, misfolded proteins accumulate in this compartment, which triggers a cell defense mechanism known as the unfolded protein response . the upr is mediated by the ire1p, an rnase, which is activated when misfolded proteins accumulate in the er lumen. activated ire1p removes an inhibitory intron from the hac <dig> mrna, which, in turn, is efficiently translated. hac1p is a transcription factor responsible for activating genes related to erad. to accommodate the accumulation of misfolded proteins until their degradation or their homeostatic recovery, the transcription factors opi1p and opi3p  are responsible for controlling the expression of genes involved in expansion of the er membrane, especially genes encoding proteins that are involved in lipid synthesis  <cit> .

three well-characterized erad pathways are present in yeast: erad-l, -m and -c, depending on the site of the misfolded lesion. proteins whose misfolded domains are located in the er lumen are targeted to erad-l, whereas proteins with misfolded membrane domains are directed to erad-m and proteins with defective domains on the cytoplasmic side of the er membrane are degraded by the erad-c pathway. therefore, when a protein is misfolded in the er lumen or membrane, it is transported to the cytoplasm, polyubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome .

the erad-c pathway is mainly composed by the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase doa10p and its associated protein complex. the doa10p complex is small when compared to the other two erad pathway complexes  <cit> . in addition to doa10p , the doa10p complex contains ubc7p , its anchoring protein cue1p and the atpase complex cdc <dig>  which is composed of the aaa-atpase cdc48p, the cofactors ufd1p and npl4p and the complex anchorage protein ubx2p  <cit> .

some studies describe a post-er system of protein quality control, which would occur at the golgi compartment. this system was suggested to be used in addition to the erad pathway upon saturation of the erad system by misfolded proteins  <cit> . only recently, wang and ng  characterized a substrate dependent on post-er golgi quality control, the protein wsc1p, which is a transmembrane protein that functions as a sensor of plasma membrane/cell wall integrity  <cit> . thus, the description of this quality control process and determination of its specific substrates represented a breakthrough since a novel biological function, i.e. degradation of proteins, was revealed.

here, we show that pof1p, a protein that was recently reported as a filamentation promoter protein  <cit> , is an atpase that is likely involved in the protein degradation pathway. the expression of pof <dig> gene was able to suppress the sensitivity of Δpct <dig> strain  to heat shock; however, the pof1p enzyme possesses no cytidylyltransferase activity but does have atpase activity. some studies have related membrane lipid biosynthesis with the erad pathway  and wide-scale studies of protein-protein physical interactions found pof1p in complex with doa10p  <cit> , ubc7p , 2010) and nas2p  <cit> . doa10p and ubc7p are components of the erad-c pathway  <cit> , and nas2p is a protein involved in proteasome assembly  <cit> . taken together, the data suggest that the biological function of pof1p is related to protein quality control.

RESULTS
we were interested to identify deletion mutant strains for genes with unknown functions that might be sensitive to oxidative stress. therefore, several yeast strains were exposed to hydrogen peroxide  or tert-butyl hydroperoxide . among them, Δpof <dig>  was highly sensitive to these oxidants .

to get insights on the involvement of pof <dig> in the antioxidant cell response, a series of bioinformatics analysis were performed  site, the uniprot consortium http://pir.georgetown.edu/cgi-bin/ipcentry?id=s <dig>  and the munich information center for protein sequences  site http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/genre/proj/yeast/searchentryaction.do?text=ycl047c, indicating that the pof <dig> gene may belong to the cytidylyltransferase family. therefore, the primary sequence of pof <dig> was aligned with the amino acid sequence of the most studied phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase protein in yeast, pct <dig>  the rate-limiting enzyme in the phosphatidylcholine synthesis pathway, which is a major membrane lipid component. also, human isoforms of choline  or ethanolamine  cytidylyltransferases amino acid sequences were aligned with pof <dig> . although the overall similarity among sequences was low , the conserved motif hxxh  <cit> , which is characteristic of the active site of the cytidylyltransferase family, was present in the predicted primary sequence of pof <dig> 

accordingly, to investigate the hypothesis that pof1p is a cytidylyltransferase, the biological complementation assay of the pct <dig> mutant strain was performed by overexpressing pof <dig> in cells challenged with heat shock stress because Δpct <dig> is sensitive to this stress  <cit> . overexpression of pof <dig> was able to reverse the heat shock sensitivity of the Δpct <dig> strain , suggesting that pof1p and pct1p share a common function. indeed, as Δpct <dig> cells, the Δpof <dig> strain was highly sensitive to heat shock. moreover, overexpression of pof <dig> also partially rescued the wild type phenotype in Δpof <dig> strain.

pure, recombinant pof1p was obtained in the soluble fraction , and pof1p was assayed for phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase activities. intriguingly, pof <dig> did not hydrolyse ctp as analyzed by thin layer chromatography , but instead it displayed atpase activity . the atpase activity was independent of the presence of phospholipid precursors in the reaction media, indicating that pof1p was not interacting with these substrates, at least when hydrolyzing atp. the reaction products were also analyzed by mass spectrometry, but no cdp-choline or cdp-ethanolamine could be detected .

since the ability of pof1p to complement pct1p function during heat shock is not related to cdp-choline activity, the hypothesis that pof1p participates in some protein quality control was tested. cells were submitted to er stress, by exposing them to high concentrations of dithiothreitol  and tunicamycin . both agents are well known to provoke accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er. Δpof <dig> cells displayed higher sensitivity to er stress agents than wild-type cells and Δubc <dig> cells  , suggesting that pof1p is involved in upr. besides, pof1p presented an atpase-specific activity of  <dig> nmol of released phosphate per hour per μm enzyme . this activity is comparable to the atpase activity of the erad-associated protein kar2p   <cit> , indicating that this enzymatic process is relevant in vivo.

interestingly, using the bioinformatics tool pipe  <dig> , with the default cutoff of  <dig>  , we could predict an interaction between the kar2p atpase and pof1p  <cit> . at a lower cutoff of  <dig>  , an interaction between pof1p and cdc48p was predicted, which is the atpase present in all types of erad pathways  <cit> . as a positive control, pof1p and kss1p interaction was predicted using the default cutoff of  <dig> . this is in agreement with experimental data showing through transcriptome data that this mitogen-activated protein kinase   interacted with pof <dig>  <cit> . as a negative control, the atpase from vacuole vma <dig> was not predicted to be an interacting partner with pof1p, even using a lower cutoff of  <dig>  .

to validate these in silico protein-protein interactions predictions, anti-pof1p rabbit polyclonal antibodies were produced. the interactions between pof1p with doa10p and with ubc7p, two components of the erad pathway, were investigated, since these complexes were previously described  <cit> . the physical interaction between nas2p and pof1p could not be investigated because there is no commercially available nas2p antibody. doa10p and pof1p did not co-immunoprecipitate under the cell growth conditions tested ; however, we did observe a physical interaction between ubc7p and pof1p in vivo . the migration of the band relative to the ubc7p and pof1p corresponded to the sum of the molecular mass of the two proteins. since western blot was performed in denaturing conditions  the band depicted with asterisk might be observed due to the formation of a mixed disulfide bond between pof1p and ubc7p. pof1p possesses six cysteine residues. probably the concentrations of dtt  employed were too low to reduce the mixed disulfide between pof1p and ubc7p.

taking advantage of the anti-pof1p antibody, the pof1p sub-cellular distribution was studied. a punctuated pof1p distribution in was observed in wild-type cells , which was more evident in Δpct <dig> cells. this is in agreement with higher protein expression of pof1p in Δpct <dig> cells, which was also observed by western blotting , suggesting a compensatory response. based on previous immunocytochemistry studies  <cit> , we speculate that pof1p localizes to the golgi compartment.

discussion
the first suggestion that the pof <dig> gene was related to the protein quality control response arose from wide-scale studies about the relationship between the erad and upr systems  <cit> . indeed, mrna levels of pof <dig> gene were significantly increased in cells that were treated with er stress agents , and this induction was dependent on both ire1p and hac1p. in addition, a proteasome inhibitor  provoked a four-fold induction of pof <dig> gene expression  <cit> .

furthermore, the expression of pof <dig> gene is repressed in the Δopi <dig> strain  <cit> , suggesting an involvement of pof1p with membrane and protein metabolism. the viability data presented here are in agreement with this idea, especially when considering the fact that all stressful conditions tested  are well known to provoke protein misfolding. yet, oxidative stress and heat shock  caused the most severe phenotypes in Δpof <dig> cells, which is likely due to the fact that these stresses damage both membrane and protein homeostasis  <cit> . the fact that pof <dig> overexpression was able to complement the function of pct <dig> in Δpct <dig> cells during heat shock  and its expression levels by opi1p  <cit>  suggests the involvement of pof1p in membrane lipid metabolism. in addition, the levels of pof1p are augmented in Δpct <dig> cells , which indicated that pof1p might at least partially backing up pct1p.

however, the molecular function of pof1p could not be directly related to membrane lipid synthesis although the protein displayed atpase activity . pof1p atpase activity was efficient enough to occur in vivo, and its specific activity was comparable to kar2p, an hsp <dig> chaperone from the er that reaches its maximum activity  when in complex with co-chaperones sec63p  and lhs1p  <cit> . pof1p atpase activity was also comparable with p <dig>  the mammal homolog of yeast cdc48p, which is the main erad atpase  <cit> . as indicated by pipe  <dig> bioinformatics analyses pof1p is predicted to interact with others proteins involved in erad, such as kar2p and cdc48p.

in addition to viability and activity results indicating that pof1p is involved in protein quality control, protein-protein interactions studies in wide-genome scale indicated the participation of pof1p as a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. hesselberth et al.  described the doa10p-pof1p complex using protein microarray technology, whereas the dip site and genemania fast gene function predictions tool  reported the ubc7p-pof1p interaction. under our growth conditions of stationary growth phase and galactose-containing medium, we did not observe doa10p-pof1p co-immunoprecipitation ; however, under the same growth conditions, we detected an ubc7p-pof1p interaction .

still taking advantage of a polyclonal pof1p antibody produced in this study, a punctuated pof1p cell distribution was observed  that is very similar to proteins localized in the golgi compartment  <cit> . although these results are preliminary, the immunocytochemical data clearly showed that pof1p is not uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm and does not co-localize with the nucleus or mitochondria where dna is stained with dapi . since er protein distribution is expected to be perinuclear, pof1b probably was not located in this organelle.

the post-er golgi protein quality control pathway has already been reported, and at least one specific substrate of this system has been characterized  <cit> . taken together, the results suggest that pof1p is an atpase that interacts with the ubiquitin conjugating protein  ubc7p and protects cells from accumulating misfolded proteins caused by oxidative, heat, reductive or chemically  stressful conditions. a possible explanation for the functional relationship between pct1p and pof1p could be due to the participation of pof1p in protein quality control. for instance, the autophagy system controls the turnover of the majority of stable proteins and coordinates degradation through the engulfment of these polypeptides into a double-lipid bilayer - the autophagosome - which fuses with a lysosome/vacuole in which degradation occurs  <cit> . given that Δpct <dig> cells have deficient membrane lipid turnover  <cit> , which probably results in lower membrane repositioning during autophagy, the er expansion would be impaired. in this situation, an increase in pof1p levels, together with several other proteins, would improve the proteasomal degradation process.

the results presented here, together with previously published data, allow us to speculate that pof1p is part of the erad pathway as an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase. pof1p may be involved in substrate recognition during ubiquitin marking because it interacts physically with an e <dig> ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, ubc7p, and it is important in the unfolded protein response. Δpof <dig> cells were more sensitive to reductive stress than the Δubc <dig> cells , this last a well-characterized protein that participates in the erad-c pathway. a possible substrate would be the map kinase molecule kss1p, which interacts physically with pof1p  <cit> . as mentioned above, kss1p is a kinase involved in the control of filamentous growth and the pheromone response. fasolo et al.  observed that Δpof <dig> cells are defective in invasive growth and pseudohyphal growth. we hypothesize that the phenotype observed in Δpof <dig> cells is due to the absence of stability regulation of kss1p exerted by pof1p.

therefore, the results described here showed that a protein involved in the yeast-to-hyphal transition  <cit>  possesses atpase activity and is important in the response of yeast to various stresses. a study on gene expression modulation during yeast filamentous-form growth showed an enriched number of genes involved in protein quality control, such as n-linked glycosylation, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism and er to golgi transport. moreover, this study pinpointed the 26s proteasome as an important component in the regulation of s. cerevisiae filamentous growth  <cit> . the yeast-to-hyphal transition is a response of several fungi to stressful conditions. for the majority of pathogenic fungi, this transformation is an essential step in their infectious process, and modifications in plasma membrane and cell wall constituents have been implicated  <cit> . the mechanisms that trigger the transition to filamentous growth in s. cerevisiae are associated with carbon or nitrogen stresses  <cit> . the interplay between the filamentation process and protein quality control may be an important feature that deserves to be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
this study characterized the molecular function of pof1p as an atpase involved in protein quality control. pof1p was important to yeast defense against oxidative, heat shock and chemically induced stress. several protein quality control components are still poorly described, despite their importance in neurological diseases. the molecular characterization of the components in yeast can be useful to understand the function of conserved human proteins.
