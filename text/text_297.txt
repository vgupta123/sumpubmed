BACKGROUND
chemotactic or chemoattractant cytokine  proteins are a unique division of cytokines characterized by their roles in cell signaling through the use of heterotrimeric gtp-binding  7-transmembrane receptors  <cit> . chemokines are the largest family of cytokines  <cit> . currently,  <dig> ligand molecules and  <dig> receptors belong to the chemokine superfamily of cytokines  <cit> . within the chemokine superfamily, protein sub-families are distinguished by differences in amino acid sequence motif of four conserved cysteines residues  <cit> . chemokine ligands in the cc  sub-family have two adjacent cysteines that are both involved in intra-chain disulfide bridges  <cit> . there are ten cc motif chemokine receptors  that bind these ligands with differing ligand binding specificity  <cit> .

chemokines, in conjunction with adhesion molecules, recruit specific subpopulations of leukocytes by activating various receptors and initiating signaling through g protein-coupled pathways  <cit> . the signaling of chemokines through their receptors affect various cellular outcomes including leukocyte trafficking, gene transcription, degranulation of immune response cells, mitogenic processes, and apoptosis  <cit> . chemokines generally act as secondary pro-inflammatory mediators that are induced by primary pro-inflammatory mediators  <cit> .

nucleotide mutations in the open reading frame coding for chemokine receptors can have a dramatic effect on receptor activity or little effect, depending on the location of the substitution and the nature of the amino acid replacement: amino acid substitutions resulting in alterations at key ligand binding extracellular domains or intracellular g-protein coupled domains in particular are known to result in disrupted or abnormal receptor activity  <cit> . deficient signal transduction can result in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases as a result of the lack of a robust signaling response to pathogenic infection  <cit> . mutations in the regulatory nucleotide sequence of chemokine receptors can also result in changes in gene expression and subsequent protein activity  <cit> .

in addition to their roles as pro-inflammatory agents in innate immune response through binding of endogenous ligands and subsequent receptor activation, some chemokine receptors have been co-opted to act as receptors or fusion proteins for a number of pathogens including hiv- <dig> strains  <cit> , protozoan parasites plasmodium knowlesi and p. vivax  <cit> , and epstein-barr virus  <cit> ; herpesviruses mimic host chemokine receptors to elude host immune responses  <cit> . mutations in regulatory or coding sequences for chemokine receptors that are used as pathogen fusion proteins can alter host-pathogen interactions: amino acid substitutions in extracellular domains can prevent recognition by the pathogen or interfere with the pathogen's ability to utilize the receptor as a gateway into the cell. genetic markers associated with disease resistance have been found in regulatory and coding sequences of chemokine receptors  <cit> .

because of their critical role in signaling immune responses, chemokine receptors are subjects of intense selection to accommodate signaling molecules, and are expected to experience purifying selection to maintain conformation and functionality of ligand binding and signaling  <cit> . however, because of their role as targets of pathogen entry, chemokine receptors are also expected to experience positive selection pressure in response to viral/pathogen hijacking  <cit> . loci that are involved in responses to a variety of pathogens may experience balancing selection as a result of diverging selection pressures acting simultaneously on genes which may result in the maintenance of polymorphism  <cit> . given this apparent evolutionary tension, it is of interest to investigate the signature of selection on this subfamily of chemokine receptors.

RESULTS
hypothesis testing with site models
this paper presents the results of paml hypothesis testing on chemokine receptor sequence datasets with "site" models only  <cit> . these models analyze sequence data at the level of the codon, and test whether a hypothesis  that allows for positive selection  is better fit to the data when compared to a null neutral hypothesis , determined through performing a likelihood ratio test between the likelihood scores of the null neutral and selection models. each set of orthologous gene sequences was analyzed independently of one another such that only ccr <dig> gene sequences were included in the first data set, only ccr <dig> gene sequences were included in the second data set, and so on for each of the ten ccr genes .

when testing the hypothesis that some codon sites within chemokine receptor coding sequences have experienced positive selection pressure, significant results were obtained for some codons within the genes ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> . for ccr <dig>  the comparison between a null neutral site model which does not allow positive selection  and a selection site model  yielded a likelihood ratio test statistic of  <dig> , which did not allow for rejection of the null hypothesis of neutral selection. however, the comparison between an additional pair of site models, m <dig>  and m <dig>  for ccr <dig> yielded a likelihood test ratio statistic of  <dig> , significant at p =  <dig> , and a proportion of sites  with ω =  <dig> . the analysis for ccr <dig> had a total of  <dig> amino acid sites, and nine amino acid sites were identified as sites of positive selection  using bayes empirical bayes  analysis  <cit> . one of the nine amino acid sites identified under positive selection had strong support with beb posterior probability >95%. eight of the nine amino acids identified as having experienced positive selection in the coding sequence of ccr <dig> are located in extracellular domains of the protein; one positively selected amino acid residue is located in the second transmembrane domain, near the transmembrane/extracellular boundary .

the test statistic 2Δl is compared to a χ <dig> distribution with  <dig> degrees of freedom, critical values  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  at 5%, 1%, and  <dig> % significance, respectively. significant results are indicated by asterisks. values for non-significant comparisons are presented in additional file  <dig> 

asterisks indicate posterior probability p > 95%  and p > 99%. for codon position, the amino acid number is given followed by an abbreviation for the domain in which the amino acid is found: ec = extracellular, mb = membrane bound, ic = intracellular.

for hypothesis testing of site models with ccr <dig> gene sequences, the comparison of m1a  vs. m2a  site models led to rejection of the null, neutral hypothesis in favor of selection with a likelihood test ratio statistic of  <dig> , significant at p =  <dig> , with a proportion of sites , and ω =  <dig> , indicating positive selection for those codon sites . five specific codon sites within the coding sequence were reported under positive selection with a beb analysis following site testing: one site had strong support with beb posterior probability greater than 95%, and one site had very strong support with beb posterior probability greater than 99% . a significant result was also obtained in the comparison of the second set of site models, m <dig> versus m <dig>  with a test statistic of  <dig> , significant at p =  <dig> , with a proportion of sites  having a dn/ds value of  <dig>  . the analysis for ccr <dig> included  <dig> amino acid sites, and eleven specific amino acid sites were reported under positive selection with a beb analysis following the site test. three of these positively selected amino acid sites had posterior probabilities greater than 95%, one site had a posterior probability greater than 99% . all of the positively selected sites identified for ccr <dig> in this analysis were located in extracellular domains of the receptor protein . a summary of results  for all site model tests is presented in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
none of the ten cc motif chemokine receptors has a signature of positive selection as indicated by an ω value  greater than one averaged over all codons as determined by hypothesis testing using branch models in paml . site tests, which analyze the sequence at the unit of the codon, revealed a proportion of codon sites that display evidence of positive selection  within the coding sequences of ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  the results obtained under the two sets of site models  differ in some aspects; for example, the more conservative m1a vs. m2a comparison did not reveal statistically significant results for ccr <dig> while the m <dig> vs. m <dig> comparison did reveal significant differences, allowing for the identification of positively selected sites. for ccr <dig>  while both m1a vs. m2a and m <dig> vs. m <dig> were both statistically significant comparisons, the comparison between m <dig> and m <dig> identified the same five codon sites that had been identified under m1a vs. m2a comparison as well as additional positively selected sites that were not identified in the m1a vs. m2a comparison. the differences in the results obtained using different models reflect that the m1a vs. m2a comparison is a more conservative test which may fail to detect positively selected sites identified by the less conservative m <dig> vs. m <dig> comparison.

it is interesting to note that in the results obtained for ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  nineteen out of the twenty amino acid sites that are identified as having experienced positive selection are located in the extracellular domains of the chemokine receptor proteins, suggesting that nonsynonymous substitutions are occurring, and more often being selected for, in the ligand binding and pathogen interaction regions of the receptors. previous studies on ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and other cc chemokine receptors have identified the amine-terminus and extracellular domains as being important for both the endogenous ligand-binding functions  <cit>  as well as for binding efficacy for pathogens in situations where these receptors have been co-opted as fusion proteins  <cit> . these previous results coupled with the findings presented here point to the extracellular domains of cc chemokine receptor proteins being especially relevant to studies of the evolution of structure and function of receptors for endogenous ligand binding ability and as targets of pathogen interaction.

recombination or gene conversion between paralogs in the chemokine receptor family has been investigated and described, particularly for ccr2/ <dig> conversion in several orders of mammals  <cit> . conversion events between ccr1/ <dig> in rodents have also been reported  <cit> . these conversion events have primarily involved transmembrane regions, but some conversion events have occurred more extensively over ccr gene sequences and have impacted extracellular domains; for example the first extracellular loop of ccr <dig> converted by recombination with ccr <dig> in mus  <cit> , extracellular loop  <dig> of ccr <dig> converted by recombination with ccr <dig> in homo and oryctolagus  <cit> , and extracellular loop  <dig> of ccr <dig> converted by recombination with ccr <dig> in mus  <cit> .

analysis of sequences that have undergone gene conversion can lead to higher rate of false-positives when using maximum likelihood methods to detect positive selection, particularly in small data sets with only a few sequences, although the rate of false positives is only increased moderately  <cit> . to minimize the impact of gene conversion events on the results of this study and as an alternative to eliminating sequences or parts of sequences that have undergone conversion events, each set of orthologous genes was analyzed independently of one another such that highly similar sequences resulting from gene conversion events within a species involving paralogous genes were not included in the same analysis, but rather were analyzed independently in separate data sets . in addition, a bayes empirical bayes  analysis was used rather than naïve empirical bayes  to identify putative codons under positive selection as neb is less conservative and can be more prone to error in smaller data sets  <cit>  whereas beb produces a low rate of false-positives with sequences that have experienced gene conversion  <cit> .

both of the genes containing positively selected codon sites  have been reported to have undergone gene conversion events as discussed above; however, in the case of ccr <dig>  gene conversion events have led to the conversion of ccr <dig> by ccr <dig>  whereas in the case of ccr <dig>  it is ccr <dig> that has been converted by ccr <dig>  the results presented here, in which only one gene of a gene conversion pair displays evidence of positive selection through hypothesis testing, indicate that independent analyses of sequences that have undergone gene conversion may mitigate the detection of false-positives due to gene conversion.

CONCLUSIONS
site tests, which analyze genetic sequences at the unit of the codon, revealed a proportion of codon sites that display evidence of positive selection  within the coding sequences of mammalian cc motif chemokine receptor genes ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  nineteen of the twenty amino acid sites identified as having experienced positive selection are located in extracellular domains of the chemokine receptor proteins ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  these results suggest that amino acid residues present in intracellular and membrane-bound domains of mammalian cc motif chemokine receptor proteins are more selectively constrained, whereas amino acid residues in extracellular domains of these receptor proteins evolve more quickly, perhaps due to heightened selective pressure resulting from ligand-binding and pathogen interactions of extracellular domains.
