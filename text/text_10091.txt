BACKGROUND
estrogens regulate diverse physiological processes in reproductive tissues and in mammary, cardiovascular, bone, liver, and brain tissues  <cit> . the most potent and dominant estrogen in human is 17β-estradiol . the biological effects of estrogens are mediated primarily through estrogen receptors α and β , ligand-inducible transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily. estrogens control multiple functions in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells  <cit> , and erα, in particular, plays a major role in the etiology of the disease, serving as a major prognostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer management  <cit> .

binding of hormone to receptor facilitates both genomic and non-genomic erα activities to either activate or repress gene expression. target gene regulation by erα is accomplished primarily by four distinct mechanisms   <cit> :  ligand-dependent genomic action , in which erα binds directly to estrogen response elements  in dna. candidate dbga gene targets include pr and bcl-2;  ligand-dependent, ere-independent genomic action . in i-dbga, erα regulates genes via protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors , sp <dig>  and nuclear factor-κb )  <cit> . target i-dbga genes include mmp- <dig> and igfnp4;  ligand-independent erα signaling, in which gene activation occurs through second messengers downstream of peptide growth factor signaling . ligand-independent mechanism can be either dbga or i-dbga. these pathways alter intracellular kinase and phosphatase activity, induce alterations in erα phosphorylation, and modify receptor action on genomic and non-genomic targets;  rapid, non-genomic effects through membrane-associated receptors activating signal transduction pathways such as mapk and akt pathways . note that the term, non-genomic effect, is based on the fact that estrodial signaling pathway doesn't involve erα itself  and as a consequence there is no direct erα mediated transcription. furthermore, target genes can receive input from multiple estrogen actions, e.g., cyclin d <dig> is a target of multiple transcription factors : sp <dig>  ap <dig>  stat <dig>  and nfκb  <cit> . these four complex regulatory mechanisms, which describe the distribution of erα and co-regulators in the nucleus and membrane signal transduction proteins, are called topological mechanisms and instrumental in sustaining breast cancer growth and progression.

dynamic gene expression changes characterize the breast cancer cell response to estrogens, and the kinetics of erα target genes are strongly influenced by the hormone treatment times. early work by inoue et al.  <cit>  revealed distinct gene clusters that correspond to either early or late e2-responsive genes. frasor and co-workers  <cit>  defined "early" responsive targets in mcf <dig> cells as genes up- or down-regulated by  <dig> h after e <dig> treatment; genes induced by  <dig> h post e <dig> treatment were classified as "late" responders and can be blocked by the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide. it was further demonstrated that cyclin d <dig> expression was mediated by the interaction of erα-sp <dig>  and by mapk-activated eik- <dig> and srf  <cit>  . as erα binding sites are more significantly associated with e <dig> up-regulated rather than down-regulated genes  <cit> , carroll et al. hypothesized that physiologic squelching is a primary cause of early down-regulation and late down-regulation is an erα-mediated event. collectively, these studies and many others  <cit>  strongly support a temporal mechanism of erα regulation.

a number of gene regulatory network models have been developed to integrate chip-chip and gene expression data, including genetic regulatory module algorithm   <cit> , statistical analysis of network dynamics   <cit> , bayesian error analysis model   <cit> , and two-stage constrained space factor analyses  <cit> . although a unified model framework was used to establish regulatory networks, those computational approaches were not capable of distinguishing genomic and non-genomic mechanisms, presumably due to failure to account for key differences in the type of data corresponding to genomic and non-genomic mechanisms. erα genomic targets consist of protein binding signals , which is not the case for non-genomic targets, and thus models and regulation selection for genomic and non-genomic erα regulatory mechanisms are different. in addition, although the above computational approaches join models for chip-chip and gene expression data, tf motif scans are not typically performed, making it difficult to infer erα dbga or i-dbga targets from these approaches.

in this study, we developed a new modulated empirical bayes approach to assemble the erα regulatory network. our approach, for the first time, differentiates topological features of erα regulation mechanisms: dbga, i-dbga, and nga. by examining the estrogen-responsive gene network in breast cancer cell models, we established that the erα regulatory network changes over time. this modulated empirical bayes model controls false positives arising from chip-chip binding data, tf binding site  motif scans, and differential gene expression profiles. two applications of this regulatory network were studied. in the first application, the agonist/antagonist activities of two active metabolites of tamoxifen, 4-oh-tamoxifen and endoxifen, were investigated. the second application investigated the impact of epigenetics  on erα regulatory network in our previously established breast cancer cell model of acquired tamoxifen resistance  <cit> .

RESULTS
data analyses overview
the erα regulatory network model was developed based on differential gene expression data for mcf <dig>   <cit>  and erα chip-chip data  <cit> . the antagonistic/agonistic effects of oht and endoxifen on this network were assessed using mcf <dig> gene expression microarray data at  <dig> hour post e <dig>  oht, endoxifen, e2+oht, and e2+endoxifen treatments  <cit> . in mcf <dig> cells with acquired resistance to tamoxifen, the response of the erα regulatory network was evaluated using gene expression microarray data  <cit> , and the epigenetic mechanisms for non-responsive erα network in mcf7-t cells were investigated by h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> chip-seq data and mcip-seq.

erα regulation mechanisms and erα targets
based on erα chip-chip data and microarray mrna expression profiles after e <dig> stimulation of mcf <dig> breast cancer cells, we categorized erα regulatory mechanisms into three groups : genomic action with erα direct ere binding , genomic action with erα indirect/ere-independent  binding , and non-genomic/ligand-independent action . in dbga, the activation of erα can be either by e <dig>  or growth factor-mediated phosphorylation  . our current data is not able to distinguish between these two types of mechanisms.

different erα mechanisms and their targets in mcf <dig> cell are displayed in figure  <dig>  for the three erα mechanisms described above, more up-regulated targets were observed than down-regulated targets after  <dig> hour e <dig> stimulation . both dbga and nga mechanisms have more targets than i-dbga has. after  <dig> hour e <dig> stimulation, a greater  number of down-regulated targets was observed for all three mechanisms . these results are not totally consistent with the results in  <cit> , as we use the 20% fold-change as an additional filtering criterion. many significantly down-regulated genes have small fold change, especially after  <dig> hour e <dig> treatment.

it is interesting to note that the number of dbga and i-dbga targets at  <dig> hour was approximately doubled compared to  <dig> hour, while an approximate 5-fold increase in the number of nga targets was observed at  <dig> hours . furthermore, there was strikingly little overlap among the erα targets between the two time points  respectively.

gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed for the genomic and non-genomic targets at  <dig> and  <dig> hour after e <dig> stimulation, and the top  <dig> functional categories are listed in table  <dig> . although both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms share only a small number of targets, their functions are highly consistent. at both  <dig> and  <dig> hours, genomic targets are mainly responsible for gene expression, cell morphology, cellular growth/development/movement, and cell cycle/death. on the other hand, at both time points, non-genomic targets are attributed to rna post-translational modification, dna replication/re-combination/repair, amino acid metabolism, cellular assembly and organizations. therefore, genomic and non-genomic mechanisms have dramatically different impacts on the molecular and cellular functions in breast cancer cells.

erα regulatory networks and their hubs
after  <dig> hours of e <dig> stimulation, the erα regulatory network is composed of an erα hub and multiple interconnected hubs . both erα  and sp <dig>  hubs are consistent with genomic mechanisms, while the other hubs follow non-genomic mechanisms. the target sizes of genomic and non-genomics hubs are approximately equal; however, after  <dig> hour of e <dig> stimulation, there is a pronounced increase in the number of non-genomic hubs and targets compared to genomic hubs and targets . these results demonstrate that while both genomic and non-genomic hubs are equally important, a greater number of late response e <dig> targets are activated through non-genomic mechanisms compared to genomic hubs. in addition, a striking feature of this dynamic erα regulatory network is that a consistent set of transcription factors appear to control the hubs, despite the lack of overlap for hub targets between the two time points . these factors include . further comparison of the significant hubs between the  <dig> and  <dig> hour networks shows that both statistical significance  and hub size are consistent between two time points for both genomic and non-genomic hubs .

antagonistic/agonistic effects of tamoxifen metabolites: 4-oh tamoxifen and endoxifen
different serms have been shown to have different antagonistic/agonistic on e <dig> up- and down-regulated genes  <cit> . the effect of the tamoxifen metabolites oht and endoxifen, both well-known serms  <cit> , on erα target networks has not been compared, particularly with regard to erα genomic/non-genomic targets. among the erα targets identified after  <dig> hour of e <dig> stimulation, 17% and 14% were responsive to oht and endoxifen respectively, with 74% of the targets overlapping . the agonist, antagonist, and partial agonist/antagonist activity of oht and endoxifen on the erα targets at  <dig> hour post e <dig> stimulation were nearly identical for the two serms .

we further classified the effects of oht and endoxifen on erα genomic/non-genomic and up/down regulation. there was a tendency for a greater agonistic effect on erα genomic targets than non-genomic targets after e <dig> or oht treatment . however, this difference in agonistic activity on genomic/non-genomic targets was not seen  after e <dig> or endoxifen treatment.

epigenetic modifications impact the erα regulatory network in tamoxifen resistant mcf <dig> cells
breast cancer cell models for acquired resistance to tamoxifen display progressive loss of estrogen-dependent signaling for cell growth and proliferation and a disrupted erα regulatory network  <cit> . among the erα targets observed after  <dig> hour e <dig> stimulation of mcf <dig>  only one target remained hormone responsive in the tamoxifen-resistant mcf7-t subline . in order to understand the role of epigenetics in this non-responsive erα network, we investigated five possible mechanisms :  high basal gene expression in the mcf7-t cell;  hypermethylation   hypomethylation ;  high methylation level in mcf7-t; and  high h3k27/h3k <dig> ratio. as shown in figure  <dig>  these mechanisms account for approximately 27%, 19%, 15%, 34%, and 22% of the non-responsive targets ; however, these five mechanisms are not able to account for approx. 28% of targets. substantial  overlap was seen between hypermethylation  and high basal methylation in mcf7-t cell  .

validation studies
pol ii-binding. we compared polii binding signals in mcf <dig> before and after  <dig> hour e <dig> stimulation. nearly all erα genomic targets displayed the same direction in fold-change between polii binding and gene expression signals . among the non-genomic targets, this concordance rate dropped slightly . on the other hand, the concordance rate among non-targets was 55%.

h3k <dig> dimethylation is a well established histone marker for transcription activation acetylation marker. we selected the median of h3k <dig> dimethylation chip-seq signal as the threshold. almost all erα genomic targets displayed h3k <dig> dimethylation higher than the median . among the non-genomic targets, this concordance rate dropped slightly . on the other hand, the concordance rate among non-targets was 49%.

overlap of  <dig> hour and  <dig> hour estrogen targets in the mcf <dig> cell we used a different data set by cicatiello et al.  <cit> , in which mcf <dig> cells were treated with e <dig>  and sampled at baseline,  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr. this experiment was performed on a different gene expression platform, illunima. we applied a similar empirical bayes model and the same fold change threshold. we obtained a similar percentage of up/down regulated genes after 4h/24h estrogen treatment. in addition, the overlap of  <dig> and  <dig> hour gene targets was, 7%, similar to what we found out with our data.

rt-qpcr, chip-pcr, and cobra. we further investigated four types of epigenetics mechanisms.

• mechanism 1: gab <dig> and lamb <dig> were non-responsive in our network due to significantly increased basal expression in mcf7-t vs. mcf <dig> . although rt-qpcr analysis confirmed that gab <dig> and lamb <dig> expression was significantly higher in mcf7-t vs. mcf <dig> , both genes were slightly responsive to e <dig> in mcf7-t. our interpretation is that affymetrix technology can be saturated for highly expressed genes, becoming insensitive to subtle expression changes. nonetheless, the non-responsive mechanism needs further experimental investigation.

• mechanism 5: pgr, pls <dig>  spata <dig>  greb <dig>  and maoa were non-responsive because of a high ratio of h3k27me3:h3k4me <dig> in mcf7-t vs. mcf <dig>  using chip-pcr, this mechanism was validated in four of five target genes .

• mechanisms  <dig> and 4: the dna methylation status four erα targets  was examined. using cobra assays, increased dna methylation was observed in pgr and pls <dig> in mcf7-t compared to mcf <dig> , and increased methylation in the mcf7-t and the mcf <dig> . furthermore, in the non-responsive erα network, both pgr and pls <dig> displayed both repressive epigenetic modifcations, the altered histone methylation ratio  and altered dna methylation .

discussion
advantage of the modulated empirical bayes method in assembling a tf regulatory network model
our proposed erα regulatory network model framework differs from existing methods in its ability to distinguish between genomic and non-genomic actions, and the assumption for functional tfs. the pioneer tf regulatory network for saccharomyces cerevisiae, developed by luscombe et al.  <cit>  and lee et al.  <cit> , emphasized that tfs themselves should be highly expressed and display differences in expression level. however, these assumptions tend to be overly stringent and not suitable for our data. our gene expression microarray data suggested that the majority of the tfs  are expressed at low levels in mcf <dig> cells, and e <dig> stimulation results primarily in changes in tf phosphorylation state and not robust changes in tf expression in breast cancer cell lines, including mcf <dig>  <cit> . all of the tfs in our genomic and non-genomic hubs didn't change their expression significantly . stringent statistical models have recently been developed to establish tf regulatory networks  <cit> . such regression-based approaches were not significant when used to analyze our data , mainly due to the fact that tfs, including erα, have both up- and down-regulated targets. if targets that change in opposite directions are not treated differently, the regression model will cancel-out any effect of a tf on gene expression. therefore, regression model-based approaches to identify tf regulatory networks can be sensitive to a mis-specified model.

our proposed empirical bayes method modulates fdr calculations from differential gene expression data, chip-chip binding peaks, and tf motif scans. the inferred erα regulatory network model has the following features and advantages:

• distinct genomic and non-genomic mechanisms.

• less stringent requirements on tf gene expression levels.

• modulated data analysis leading to robust conclusions with respect to model misspecifications.

• modulated model assembly results in an extendable tf network, which is particularly useful when additional data becomes available for new molecular mechanisms.

erα regulatory network and corresponding hubs
when constructing genomic targets of the erα regulatory network, tfs are scanned within a narrow region, 45bp, of erα chip-chip binding sites. this calculation scheme enables the identification of either dbga or indirect i-dbga. in many previous studies  <cit> , relatively large neighborhoods surrounding the erα binding site  were scanned for consensus sequences of tfbss. while this is an effective strategy for identifying co-regulatory tfs, it is not an effective approach for inferences regarding dbga or i-dbga. for example, lin et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that eres and ere half-sites were enriched for other transcription factors motifs, supporting the notion that tfs, in addition to erα, can bind to ere. in our analysis, we identified only sp- <dig> as an i-dbga. although ap <dig> has been reported to be an i-dbga, in our data it did not pass the false positive threshold , due to its relatively short tfbs . binding motifs for forkhead tfs have also been reported to be enriched within erα binding regions in mcf <dig> cells by chip-chip  <cit> . however, in our study, there was not sufficient evidence to support foxa <dig> as an i-dbga , a result supported by recent studies using chip-seq and chip-dsl  <cit> . recently, rar and erα binding were shown to be highly coincident throughout the genome, competing for binding to the same or similar response elements  <cit> . our erα regulatory network model, however, is not able to identify rar targets, as the chip-chip experiments were only performed for erα binding sites and not rar.

in our analysis, non-genomic targets of the erα regulatory network were constructed using genes whose promoters, introns, or downstream sequences were devoid of erα chip-chip binding sites. significant tf scan scores of these gene promoters infer erα non-genomic action . it is worth noting that these nga differ from previously described erα co-regulator factors. nga does not require erα binding, in contrast to erα co-regulatory factors which must display erα binding peaks in the chip-chip analysis. significant nga transcription factors include zfp <dig>  tfdp <dig>  nrf <dig>  tfap2a, egr <dig>  e2f <dig>  and pitx <dig> . other significant nga includes myc, which has been previously reported  <cit> , and although myc was present in both  <dig> and  <dig> hour erα regulatory networks, the level of significance was not high enough to be considered a hub .

among the nine hubs that are significantly enriched in both  <dig> hour and  <dig> hour erα networks, two facilitate genomic activities , while the other seven hubs  mediate non-genomic actions. with the exception of , the functions of  and their functional relevance to estrogen action in breast cancer cells have been extensively documented in  <cit> .

while the erα regulatory network concept has recently been reviewed  <cit> , our study is the first to characterize genomic and non-genomic mechanisms and their different functions. the genomic mechanism is significantly involved in cell proliferation and control of cell phases, confirming a significant effect of estrogen on cell cycle regulation. biological processes significantly affected by the non-genomic mechanism include rna post-translation modification, cellular development, dna replication, re-combination, and repair. additional models describing network properties of estrogen signaling targets include the protein-protein interaction and the functional module networks  <cit> . the focus of the two networks is on the functional interpretation of the targets and not mechanism of regulation. furthermore, the edges are interpreted as either protein interaction or functional similarity and are not directional, compared to the edges in our regulatory network, which have up or down-regulation direction.

antagonist/agonist effects of serms on erα regulatory networks
we observed full and partial antagonist/agonist effect of oht on mcf <dig> after  <dig> hour e <dig> stimulation, similar to a previous study  <cit> . we further show that genomic and non-genomic actions of the erα regulatory network are differentially influenced by full or partial antagonist/agonist activities of oht and endoxifen. the current study clearly demonstrates that the e <dig> responsive erα regulatory network is disrupted by two serms , but whether new networks are stimulated by these or other serms require additional investigation.

epigenetic modifications of erα regulatory network in the mcf7-t cell
a second application of the regulatory network was to examine the impact of epigenetics  on the erα regulatory network in a breast cancer cell model for acquired tamoxifen resistance of  <cit> . transcriptionally active genes are typically marked by higher levels of di-/tri-methylated h3k <dig>  and low trimethylated h <dig> lysine  <dig>  levels  <cit> , and in hormone responsive mcf <dig> cells, e2-stimulated target genes have been shown to posses enriched regions of h3k4me1/ <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, mcf <dig> with acquired tamoxifen resistance , groups of previously e2-responsive genes are now associated with low h3k4me <dig> and high h3k27me <dig> and are either downregulated or no longer strongly hormone inducible . the h3k27me <dig> mark is stable and invariably associated with transcriptional repression  <cit>  and we show that this repressive histone modification plays a key role in the unresponsive erα regulatory network in mcf <dig> cells with acquired resistance to tamoxifen . although tumorigenic gene silencing mediated by h3k27me <dig> has been shown to occur in the absence of dna methylation  <cit> , repressive histone marks frequently coordinate with the more permanent mark of dna methylation in heterochromatin  <cit> . we previously demonstrated that alterations in dna methylation play an important role in acquired tamoxifen resistance  <cit> . by integrating both repressive epigenetic marks into our model, we demonstrate that h3k27me <dig> and dna methylation significantly contribute to the non-responsive erα regulatory network model in tamoxifen resistant breast cancer. furthermore, having recently demonstrated that many tfbss are enriched in regions of altered dna methylation  <cit> , we suggest that the functions of activators or repressors could be altered by changes to the dna methylation landscape and further impact erα networks in breast cancer, an active area of investigation in our laboratory.

when we compare the percentages of different epigenetic mechanisms , to 20% each for a random gene set based on the selected thresholds, it seems that the non-responsive targets have similar distribution of various types of epigenetic mechanisms as that of a random gene set. therefore, it is possible that there may not exist specific patterns of epigenetic mechanisms in mcf <dig> cells' acquired tamoxifen resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
in breast cancer cells, we identified a number of estrogen regulated target genes and the estrogen-regulated network that characterizes the causal relationships between transcription factors and their targets. this network has two major mechanisms, the genomic action and the non-genomic action. in genomic action, after estrogen receptor is activated by estrogen, estrogen receptor regulated genes through directing binding to dna. in non-genomic action, estrogen regulated its gene targets through non-direct binding through other factors. in the estrogen regulated network, we found that though many non-genomic targets change over time, they do share many common factors and the consistency is highly significant. moreover, we found that many gene targets of this network were not active anymore in anti-estrogen resistant cell lines, possibly because their dna methylation and histone acetylation patterns have changed. taken together, our model has revealed novel and unexpected features of estrogen-regulated transcriptional networks in hormone responsive and anti-estrogen resistant human breast cancer.
