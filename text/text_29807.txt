BACKGROUND
wastewater effluent and surrounding fresh water bodies such as rivers and estuaries have been found to contain high levels of contaminants, including disease-causing bacteria such as listeria spp. and aeromonas spp.  <cit> . the ability of these organisms to survive conventional wastewater treatment processes could lead to major environmental and human health problems, resulting from the highly contaminated surface waters  <cit> . previously, listeria has only been associated with food related infections and diseases, but has now been discovered and reported in water  <cit> . of the seven recognised listeria spp. , only l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii are currently deemed as pathogenic and infectious, causing diseases in animals and human beings, since they are known to display β-haemolytic activity . listeria spp., mainly l. monocytogenes cause listeriosis which develops mostly in neonates, the elderly, pregnant women, and immuno-compromised individuals  <cit> . infection by l. monocytogenes occurs in several steps, each requiring expression of specific virulence factor. the major virulence genes are located in a cluster of genes on two different dna loci and are mainly influenced by positive regulatory factor a protein. important virulence factors have been characterised; listeriolysin o encoded by the gene hlya and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c encoded by the gene plca. these genes play an important role in lysis of the phagosomes of the host cell and this makes the intracellular growth of listeria cells possible  <cit> .

aeromonads have grown in importance as food and waterborne pathogens, receiving much research attention since their discovery and implication in gastrointestinal diseases . seven aeromonas spp.,  are currently recognized as human pathogens  <cit> . aeromonads are mesophilic bacteria which are found and widely distributed in soil and mostly aquatic  environments. they are mostly opportunistic microorganisms, mainly affecting individuals with reduced or compromised immunity, children and the elderly  <cit> . aeromonas spp., have been widely reported in diarrheal diseases based on their common discovery in faecal samples of patients suffering from diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal diseases  <cit> . the wide presence of potentially pathogenic aeromonas spp. in freshwater bodies is of major public health concern  <cit> . a variety of potential virulence factors and toxins have been characterised in aeromonas spp.  <cit> , the most common ones being aer and hlya gene which are responsible for aerolysin and hemolysin toxins production, respectively  <cit> . aerolysin is one of the major virulence factors in gastroenteritis and in invasion of epithelial cells  <cit> . some studies have reported high antimicrobial resistance patterns in aeromonas spp., which increases the public threat, especially in cases of immunocompromised individuals with severe infections  <cit> .

wastewater treatment plants across south africa have displayed poor bacterial pathogen removal over the years  <cit> . furthermore, the current treatment regulations and guidelines mainly using common indicator organisms as a standard for monitoring drinking water and wastewater treatment processes have proven to be unreliable  <cit> . this is of great public concern considering that an estimated 77 % of south africans depend on surface water for most of their domestic water needs  <cit> . worse cases of waterborne infections have been seen and reported mostly in poverty stricken populations which lack adequate sanitation and infrastructure as surrounding populations have easy and uncontrolled access to free-flowing, highly contaminated waters to meet their water needs  <cit> . the prevalence of listeria and aeromonas spp. in treated wastewater effluent has been reported both in developing and developed countries  <cit> . also, wastewater has been reported to be a potential reservoir and transporter of pathogenic listeria and aeromonas which harbour virulence determinants and display a notable trend of resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents  <cit> . however, there is no report on the prevalence, antibiogram and virulence signatures of listeria and aeromonas spp. in effluent discharge of wastewater treatment plants in kwazulu-natal province of south africa. this study therefore evaluated the antibiotic resistance phenotype and virulence properties of listeria and aeromonas spp. recovered from treated effluent of two wastewater treatment plants in durban.

methods
water sampling and bacterial isolation
wastewater and river samples were collected from two different wastewater treatment plants, designated as nwtw and ngwtw, located in the durban area . permissions were obtained from the relevant authority of both treatment plants to carry out water sampling. water samples were collected before and after chlorination of the final treated effluent, and approximately  <dig> m up and downstream of discharge point into the receiving waters. samples were serially diluted with sterile distilled water and 50 ml of the appropriate dilutions were filtered using standard  <dig>  μm pore sized filters, according to standard membrane filtration methods. membrane filters were then aseptically transferred onto rimler-shotts agar   and listeria chromogenic agar   for identification of aeromonas spp and listeria spp., respectively. presumptive isolates with typical appearance on the respective medium  were inoculated separately onto fresh selective media to obtain pure culture, before sub-culturing onto nutrient agar plates for identification.

identification of the bacterial isolates
biochemical identification of listeria and aeromonas spp.
identification of the presumptive aeromonas and listeria spp. recovered from treated effluent and the receiving rivers was carried out using a range of biochemical tests, including oxidase, catalase, urease, carbohydrate fermentation, acid formation , indole production tests, methyl red and voges-proskauer test  <cit> .

molecular identification
polymerase chain reaction  was used to amplify and detect the presence of specific conserved sequences in presumptive listeria spp. and aeromonas spp. isolates using primers list-universal  <dig> and  <dig>  and gyrb3f and gyrb14r, respectively  . dna was extracted using the boiling method according to bai et al. modified protocol  <cit> . all pcr amplifications were performed in a thermal cycler . for the detection of iap gene in listeria spp., pcr conditions were as follows: pre-denaturation at 95 °c for 5 min, 30 cycles of; denaturation at 95 °c for 1 min, annealing at 36 °c for 1 min, extension at 72 °c for 3 min and final extension at 72 °c for 7 min  <cit> . pcr was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm kcl, 10 mm tris/hcl ,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μm of each dntps ,  <dig>  u supertherm taq dna polymerase ,  <dig>  μm of each primer  and 1 μl of the extracted dna sample  <cit> . listeria monocytogenes atcc  <dig> was used as a positive control in all pcr assays. for the pcr amplification of gyrb gene in aeromonas spp., the following conditions were applied: pre-denaturation at 94 °c for 2 min, 30 cycles of; denaturation at 93 °c for 30 s, annealing at 62 °c for 30 s and extension at 72 °c for 1 min  <cit> . pcr was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm kcl, 10 mm tris/hcl ,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm dntps , 1u supertherm taq dna polymerase ,  <dig> pmol of each primer  and 1 μl of the extracted dna sample  <cit> . aeromonas caviae atcc  <dig> and aeromonas hydrophila atcc  <dig> strain were used as positive controls.table  <dig> characteristics of primers used for pcr amplification of genus specific genes and virulence genes

discussion
the successful identification of the aeromonas and listeria spp using the biochemical and molecular methods indicates the prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in treated wastewater effluent, reiterating the fact that they are able to withstand and survive conventional wastewater treatment processes as previously reported  <cit> . the observed highest resistance  of aeromonas spp. against ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin and fusidic acid in this study was in line with those reported in similar studies  <cit> , where ampicillin and vancomycin were amongst the antibiotics which had no antimicrobial activity towards tested aeromonas spp. isolates. however, goni-urriza et al.  <cit>  and p´erez-valdespino et al.  <cit> , did not observe complete resistance of aeromonas spp. tested to these antibiotics, but a similar trend of high resistance levels was observed. also, the high sensitivity patterns observed against gentamicin, fosfomycin, cefotaxime, amikacin, and meropenem in this study were comparable to previous findings  <cit> .

the susceptibility patterns of listeria spp. obtained in this study are similar to those reported by odjadjare and okoh  <cit> , who tested  <dig> listeria isolates against  <dig> antibiotics and found that all tested isolates were sensitive to  <dig> of the  <dig> test antibiotics including amikacin , meropenem, and ertapenem  suggesting that these antibiotics may be the best therapy in the event of listeriosis outbreak in south africa. in general, l. monocytogenes, as well as other strains of listeria spp., are susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics  <cit> , however a notable increased resistance has been observed over the past couple of years  <cit> . studies have also described the transfer, by conjugation, of enterococcal and streptococcal plasmids and transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes to listeria from closely related bacteria such as enterococcus, streptococcus and staphylococcus spp.  <cit>  and between species of listeria  <cit> . l. monocytogenes may acquire or transfer antibiotic resistance gene from mobile genetic elements such as self-transferable and mobilizable plasmids and conjugative transposons or mutational events in chromosomal genes  <cit> . high sensitivity levels of listeria spp. towards the β-lactams  and penicillins have been reported in literature, and these antibiotics are therefore considered as the main treatment drug for listeriosis . in contrast, results obtained in this study revealed high resistance levels towards the β-lactams: penicillin , cephalothin  and ampicillin . arslan and ozdemir  <cit>  also reported resistance against ampicillin  and penicillin  in strains of listeria spp. isolated from white cheese.

it has been widely reported that conventional wastewater treatment plants are unable to effectively remove antimicrobials such as antibiotics as well as a number of other chemicals from wastewater, thereby increasing the chances of bacterial pathogens resident in such wastewater effluent to acquire resistance to commonly used antibiotics due to selective pressures . medical and pharmaceutical discharge from hospitals has largely contributed to the increase in antibiotic concentration and therefore has led to the rise of highly resistant bacterial populations  <cit> . wastewater treatment plants have therefore been considered as a rich reservoir of antibiotic and multidrug resistant organisms since the antibiotics ingested by humans are not completely processed by the body. some of these antibiotics are expelled as waste and wind up at wastewater treatment plants  <cit> . rivers contaminated with urban and agricultural effluent have shown to have greater antibiotic resistant bacterial populations than areas upstream of the contamination source  <cit> . antibiotic resistance in streams is also indirectly selected for by an increase in industrial wastes containing heavy metals, which could probably explain the findings of this study since both wastewater treatment plants investigated are surrounded by industrial areas, receiving wastes containing carcinogenic heavy metals and toxic chemicals as well hospital effluents. recent findings suggest an increase in the level of multi-antibiotic resistance over the last few years . it is therefore not surprising that a high prevalence of multi-antimicrobial resistance was observed among the listeria spp. in this study.

the infection or pathogenicity process of aeromonas spp. is very complex and is said to involve different virulent and pathogenicity factors which either act together or separately at different stages of infection. aerolysin gene is responsible for most of the haemolytic, cytotoxic and enterotoxic activities, which play a vital role in the initial stages of the host infection process  <cit> . this gene was detected in 52 % of the isolates, similar to the findings of igbinosa and okoh  <cit>  who reported a high presence  of the aer gene in aeromonas spp. isolated from water samples in south africa. similarly, soler et al.  <cit>  detected this gene in 26 % of the tested environmental aeromonas isolates. the presence of this aer gene in 52 % of the aeromonas spp. obtained from treated wastewater effluent and receiving river water indicates that the isolates investigated in this study are potentially pathogenic and virulent strains of either a. hydrophila, a. caviae and a. veroni, where this gene is commonly found  <cit> . high numbers of virulence gene - containing aeromonas spp. have been observed in multiple studies, involving environmental samples, with reports from brazil, india, italy and spain alike . the lip gene which primarily plays an integrated and coherent role in pathogenicity of aeromonas spp. was detected in 68 % of the isolates. this gene is responsible for altering the host’s plasma membranes, thus increasing the severity of the infection .

in this study, some of the tested listeria species were found to harbour the acta, plca and iap genes, classifying them as possibly l. monocytogenes, l. ivanovii and l. seeligeri, species known to harbour these genes  <cit> . the haemolytic activity demonstrated by these aeromonas spp. on human red blood cells is indicative of the production of the haemolysin virulence factor. several authors have suggested that this virulence determinant is usually associated with strains of a. hydrophila and a. sobria , which are potential human pathogens. the link between haemolytic activity and enterotoxigenicity observed in this study has been well documented  <cit> . results obtained in this study indicate a possible presence of virulent listeria and aeromonas spp, which could be detrimental to the users of the receiving rivers upon exposure.

CONCLUSIONS
the high prevalence of multi-antimicrobial resistant aeromonas and listeria spp. harbouring resistance genes obtained in this study is indicative of the severity of the threat these pathogens might pose to the health of the environment and other organisms exposed to the contaminated waters. apart from the two reported emerging bacterial pathogens , other common bacterial indicators of water pollution, viz., e. coli, total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, salmonella spp, shigella spp, and vibrio spp as well as other emerging bacterial pathogens including yersinia spp , legionella spp., pseudomonas spp. were also detected in the treated effluent of these plants . this further confirmed previous report indicating a low reduction of microbes by treatment plants resulting in poor effluent quality with load of infectious microorganisms  <cit> . this is of great concern as most of the surface water samples were collected from locations which were easily accessible to animals and human populations residing in informal settlements along the river. multidrug resistant organisms found in this study were also resistant to some of the commonly used antibiotics and this is particularly worrisome in a province with a high number of immunocompromised individuals due to the high hiv and tb pandemic as this will impact on treatment regime. findings from this study further highlight the need for the department of water affairs to revise the current guidelines and standards to include the emerging bacterial pathogens, which are often detected even in the absence of commonly used indicator organisms. there is also need for constant evaluation of the wastewater treatment plants to ensure efficiency and compliance to set guidelines in order to protect public and environmental health.
