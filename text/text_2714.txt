BACKGROUND
drought is one of the main abiotic factors that cause reduction or total loss of crop production. because water is becoming limited for agriculture in many areas of the world, the investigation of natural mechanisms of drought tolerance is an important strategy for understanding the biological basis of response to drought stress and for selection of plants with improved drought tolerance  <cit> . cowpea  is an economically important crop in semi-arid and arid tropical regions in africa, asia, and central and south america, where cowpea is consumed as human food and nutritious fodder to livestock  <cit> . as a leguminous species, cowpea belongs to the same tribe  as common bean and soybean. compared to these close relatives and most other crops, cowpea is well adapted to these regions because of its ability to fix nitrogen in poor soil and greater drought tolerance  <cit> . therefore, cowpea is an excellent system for investigating the genetic basis of drought tolerance.

efforts have been made to identify genetic elements that are involved in drought stress response in cowpea. for example, over a dozen genes have been shown to be associated with drought stress response through cloning and characterization of cdnas  <cit> . in addition, ten drought tolerance quantitative trait loci  associated with tolerance in seedlings have been mapped in cowpea  <cit> . however, it is largely unknown how the expression of drought-associated cowpea genes or loci is regulated and how small rnas are involved in the regulation.

micrornas  are 20- <dig> nt single-stranded rna molecules that are processed from rna precursors that fold into stem-loop structures  <cit> . mirnas regulate gene expression of target mrnas at the posttranscriptional level, which are recognized by nearly perfect base complementarity. upon mirna-target recognition, typically the target is negatively regulated via mrna cleavage or translational repression  <cit> . functional analyses have demonstrated that mirnas are involved in a variety of developmental processes in plants  <cit> . in addition, mirnas play critical roles in plant resistance to various abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . in particular, several approaches have been employed to study mirnas that are involved in drought stress tolerance in plants. in one of the pioneering studies on stress-responsive mirnas, sunkar and zhu  <cit>  used small rna cloning techniques to identify  <dig> novel mirnas, among which mir <dig>  mir397b, and mir <dig> were upregulated by dehydration and mir389a downregulated. another mirna family, mir <dig>  was found to be downregulated by drought stress in an aba-dependent pathway. the repression of mir <dig> leads to higher expression of its target gene nfya <dig>  which in turn enhances the drought resistance of the plant  <cit> . many more mirnas that are up- or down-regulated in drought condition were discovered by global mirna expression profiling experiments with either microarray hybridization or small rna deep sequencing  <cit> .

although numerous mirnas have been identified in many plant species, including leguminous plants medicago truncatula  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , and common bean  <cit> , only two sequences have been reported for cowpea in the mirbase registry. recently,  <dig> potential mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were predicted in cowpea  <cit> . in another study,  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> families were identified  <cit> . both studies used a homology search approach to identify cowpea mirnas that are conserved in other plants. in this study, we used illumina deep sequencing technology to generate small rna reads and used these reads to identify mirnas in cowpea, especially cowpea-specific mirnas and those associated with drought tolerance. to our knowledge, this is the first report of mirnas identified through direct small rna cloning in cowpea.

despite inherent drought tolerance, cowpea varieties display significantly different levels of drought tolerance  <cit> . the study and comparison of plant genotypes differing in sensitivity to drought is a promising approach to discover natural tolerance mechanisms  <cit> . in order to gain insight into the role of mirnas in tolerance to drought, we used two representative cowpea genotypes: california blackeye no.  <dig>  and it93k503- <dig>  the drought-sensitive cb <dig> is the most widely grown blackeye-type cultivar in the united states and was developed at the university of california, davis  <cit> . it93k503- <dig> is a drought-tolerant breeding line developed by the international institute of tropical agriculture  in ibadan, nigeria. we grew these two genotypes in well-watered and drought stress conditions and used leaves from the vegetative stage to construct four small rna libraries. using small rna reads from these libraries, we identified  <dig> candidate mirnas. comparison of the expression pattern of mirnas among libraries indicates that some mirnas display different levels of expression in different genotypes, and thus may be a key factor to their different levels of drought tolerance.

RESULTS
identification of mirnas in cowpea
in order to study the role of mirnas in drought tolerance, we grew cowpea plants  in green house under well-watered and drought stress conditions. drought stress was applied to 30-day-old plants. after  <dig> to  <dig> days of moderate drought stress , the two genotypes showed apparent differences in drought tolerance. while it93k503- <dig> plants continued to grow relatively well, cb <dig> plants displayed severe drought stress symptoms such as chlorotic leaves .

we constructed four small rna libraries  and obtained on average  <dig>  million  clean small rna reads from each library . the average number of unique reads per library is  <dig>  million . using the procedure and criteria described in the materials and methods section, we mapped unique small rna reads to a cowpea est assembly, bac end sequences and methylation filtration sequences, gss sequences in dbgss, and a draft cowpea genome assembly, and predicted  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirna precursors, respectively. these four sets of putative mirna precursors were then compared with each other to remove redundancy, and we obtained  <dig> candidate mirna genes . based on similarity of mature mirna sequences, these mirna genes were clustered into  <dig> families. whereas  <dig> families  have match to mirnas from other plants in the mirbase   <cit> ,  <dig> families  appear to be cowpea-specific. using a cowpea est assembly, we have also identified putative target protein-coding genes for  <dig>  mirnas.

genotype-specific expression of mirnas
because small rna libraries were sequenced to great depth, counts of mature mirnas can be used to evaluate their relative expression levels in different genotypes and growth conditions. we first applied principal component analysis  to the log <dig> normalized counts  of  <dig> unique mature mirnas that had combined expression of at least  <dig> tptm in four libraries. as shown in figure  <dig>  the first two components account for over 93% of variation in the data set, with the first component accounting for 63%. the first component  separates two samples of one genotype from two samples of the other genotype, indicating genotype is the main factor that determines mirna expression levels. indeed, nine mirnas account for 75% of variation in pc <dig> and they show clear genotype-specific expressions . whereas two mirnas  are predominantly expressed in cb <dig>  the other seven mirnas are exclusively or predominantly expressed in it93k503- <dig> plants. the expression pattern of it93k503- <dig> specific mirna, vun_cand <dig>  was confirmed with northern blot assay .

because perfect matches were required when small rna reads were mapped to cowpea sequences for mirna prediction, genotype-specific expression of mirnas could be caused by inter-genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms  in mature mirnas. to address this possibility, we re-mapped clean small rna reads from each library to the precursors of nine mirnas in table  <dig>  allowing up to one mismatch. the normalized counts of these mature mirnas were essentially unchanged . therefore, genotype-specific expression of these mirnas was genuine and was not an artifact of the reads mapping process.

drought-associated mirnas
to identify drought-associated mirnas, we tested for differential expression of mirnas in drought-stressed and corresponding control samples in each genotype using the statistical method developed by audic and claverie  <cit> . we used the following criteria to identify drought-associated mirnas:  adjusted p-value was less than  <dig>  in at least one of the two comparisons;  normalized counts  was at least  <dig> in one of the four libraries;  log <dig> ratio of normalized counts between drought and control libraries was greater than  <dig> or less than - <dig> in one of the two genotypes. for differential expression analysis, we considered only unique mature mirnas as they are the active form of the mirna and in some cases, identical mature mirna can be generated from two or more homologous mirna genes. we found  <dig> drought-associated unique mature mirnas that belong to  <dig> families . the direction of statistically significant change was the same in both genotypes for all  <dig> mirnas, indicating that mirna gene expression in it93k503- <dig> and cb <dig> had similar overall response to drought stress. whereas thirty of  <dig> mirnas were upregulated in the drought-stressed condition, fourteen were downregulated in one or both genotypes.

among  <dig> drought-associated mirnas, the expression of  <dig> mirnas  in drought condition changed at least two-fold compared to the control in both genotypes . some of these mirna families have been found to be associated with drought stress in previous studies, including mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , mir <dig>  <cit> , and mir <dig>  <cit> . most of the predicted targets encode transcription factors . other mirna families, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and four cowpea-specific mirna  were found to be associated with drought stress for the first time .

we also found that  <dig> mirnas showed at least two-fold change only in it93k503- <dig> , and  <dig> only in cb <dig> . although statistical tests indicated that some of these mirnas  were up- or down-regulated under drought stress in both genotypes without having two-fold change,  <dig> mirnas were clearly regulated in only one genotype. whereas mir160a, mir160b, mir171e, vun_cand <dig>  vun_cand <dig>  and vun_cand <dig> were significantly regulated by drought stress in it93k503- <dig> plants only, mir171b, mir171d, mir2111b, mir390b, and mir <dig> were regulated only in cb <dig>

discussion
regulation of gene expression through sequence-specific interaction between mirnas and their target mrnas offers an accurate and inheritable mechanism for plants to respond to environment stimuli  <cit> . due to water limitations, drought is a major stress that limits the geographic distribution and yield of many crops. therefore, extensive effort has been made for discovering genetic elements and mechanisms of drought tolerance, including the discovery of drought-associated mirnas. as an important drought-tolerant crop in semi-arid and arid areas, cowpea offers a good system for the study of drought tolerance. here we used deep sequencing of small rna libraries from two cowpea genotypes and identified  <dig> mirnas. by comparing the expression level of mirnas in drought-stressed sample to control sample, we also identified  <dig> mirnas that were upregulated in drought condition and  <dig> downregulated. this list of drought-associated mirnas includes mirna families that were known to be associated with drought in other plant species, indicating that they are involved in conserved drought response pathways. some mirna families, including some cowpea-specific mirnas, were found to be associated with drought for the first time, suggesting that they may be involved in lineage- or species-specific stress response pathways and functions.

we predicted target genes for  <dig> out of  <dig> drought-associated mirnas. the predicted target mrnas encode proteins of diverse function, most of them being transcription factors . for most of the conserved mirnas, it is expected that their targets are also conserved. for example, our results showed that mir <dig> was upregulated in response to drought in cowpea. mir <dig> has been known to be responsive to abiotic stresses and targets spb transcription factors in arabidopsis, maize, rice and wheat  <cit> . this mirna is also involved in the regulation of development during vegetative phase change  <cit> , indicating that reprogramming of development is a crucial step in plants to cope with drought stress. another mirna, mir <dig>  was downregulated in both cowpea genotypes. in arabidopsis, mir <dig> was downregulated and its target, a nuclear factor y transcription factor nfya <dig>  was induced by drought stress  <cit> . mir <dig> most likely functions in a similar way in cowpea to enhance drought tolerance by inducing the expression of nfya <dig> orthologs.

the cowpea genotypes studied in this work have different abilities of drought tolerance. because the two genotypes are highly similar to each other in their genetic composition, their phenotypic variations such as drought tolerance are most likely caused by changes in regulatory processes, rather than changes in proteins  <cit> . due to their different geographical origins, the two genotypes are adapted to the particular environmental conditions in their natural habitats. it is thus expected to find constitutive differences, which could be related to metabolism, use of energetic resources, mobilization of biomass, structure of radical system, wax deposition in leaves, membrane stability or density of stomata, among other characteristics. we found that nine mirnas were predominantly or exclusively expressed in only one genotype, regardless of the treatments. on the other hand,  <dig> mirnas were found to be differentially expressed under drought stress in one genotype, but not the other. changes in mirna expression are expected to cause changes in the expression of target genes between the two genotypes.

among mirnas that had genotype-specific regulation, mir160a and mir160b were upregulated in response to drought in the tolerant, but not in the sensitive cultivar . their putative targets are members of the family of auxin response factors . arfs are key elements in regulation of physiological and morphological mechanisms mediated by auxins that may contribute to stress adaptation  <cit> . moreover, negative regulation of arf <dig> by mir <dig> was demonstrated to be critical during seed germination in arabidopsis thaliana through the crosstalk between auxin and aba-dependent pathways  <cit> . on the other hand, two members of the mir <dig> family were upregulated by drought in the sensitive, but not in the tolerant cultivar . their putative targets are kelch repeat-containing f-box proteins that belong to a large family with members known to be involved in response to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . furthermore, f-box proteins containing kelch repeats have been found to be responsive to drought in chickpea, a close relative of cowpea  <cit> . this suggests that genotype-specific regulation of mirnas might be part of the reason why some cowpea genotypes have stronger drought tolerance than others.

among the new mirna candidates that were identified in this study, ten were regulated by drought stress and target genes were predicted for five of them. for instance, vun_cand <dig> was downregulated by drought and putatively targets a zinc finger protein. zinc finger proteins are known to be involved in a variety of functions in development and stress response  <cit> . moreover, vun_cand <dig> was upregulated by drought in the tolerant cultivar and putatively targets a basic-helix-loop-helix  transcription factor. these proteins have roles in response to abiotic stresses, such as iron deficiency  <cit> , freezing, and salt stress  <cit> . this suggests these new mirnas may be indeed an integral component of drought response in cowpea.

for many mirnas there were more than one target predicted. the possibility of a mirna to have multiple targets is commonly observed. to confirm these predicted targets, we need to perform detailed analysis of cleavage of mrna targets at the mirna recognition site by experimental approaches, such as race and degradome analysis  <cit> . once we validate the targets of drought-associated mirnas, we will be in a better position to link the expression changes of mirnas and their targets to differences of drought tolerance in cowpea.

because we do not have the complete cowpea genome sequence, some mirna genes were not identified, even though they had significant expression in our small rna libraries. to find out how many mirna families have been missed, we mapped unique small rna reads to plant mirna precursors in the mirbase, allowing up to  <dig> mismatches. although we did not miss a large number of mirnas, we did find that mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> had significant expression in our libraries . the latter two were also induced by drought stress. mir <dig> was identified as drought-associated mirna in rice  <cit> . however, contrary to the pattern that we found in cowpea, it was downregulated under drought stress in rice. it is not clear whether it was caused by different sampling time or tissue, or species-specific stress response mechanisms.

like protein coding genes, many mirna families possess more than one mirna gene and mirna genes from the same family may have either identical or similar but different mature mirna sequences. during evolutionary process, homologous mirna genes may functionally diverge from each other. in the set of mirnas that we identified in cowpea, members from mir <dig> and mir <dig> families showed clear evidence for functional diversification. while one member mirna gene  was induced by drought stress, another mirna from the same family  was significantly downregulated .

CONCLUSIONS
using deep sequencing technology, we identified  <dig> mirnas in cowpea, including  <dig> mirnas that are drought-associated. by comparing mature mirna counts in different genotypes and growth conditions, we found  <dig> mirnas that were almost exclusively expressed in only one genotype and  <dig> mirnas that were regulated by drought stress in one genotype, but not the other. our study demonstrated that deep sequencing of small rnas is a cost-effective way for mirna discovery and expression analysis. compared to the homology search method, deep sequencing allowed the detection of species-specific mirnas and digital expression analysis. our findings demonstrate that expression patterns of some mirnas may be very different even between two genotypes of the same species. further characterization of the targets of drought-associated mirnas will help understand the details of response and tolerance to drought in cowpea.
