BACKGROUND
almost 90% of human genetic variations result from single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . among snps resulting in amino acid changes, non-synonymous snps  are an important source of individual variation and can result in inherited diseases and drug sensitivity  <cit> . therefore, the identification of nssnps that affect protein function and relate to disease will be a challenge in the coming years  <cit> .

a variety of methods have been developed to identify whether an nssnp is detrimental to protein function in vitro. most of these methods utilize evolutionary data  <cit> , protein structure information  <cit> , or both  <cit> . ng and henikoff  <cit>  developed the software sift  to predict the effect of nssnps on protein function; sift is based on sequence conservation and scores from position-specific scoring matrices. some studies  <cit>  have used phylogenetics to identify functionally critical residues within a protein. the mapp   <cit>  software exploits the physicochemical variation between wild-type amino acid residues and newly introduced residues to identify nssnps that impair protein function. the method align-gvgd  <cit>  uses both genetic biochemical variation and genetic distance between the wild-type residue and newly introduced residue to predict the effects of an nssnp. some methods  <cit>  take advantage of three-dimensional structural information to analyze the impact of amino acid changes on protein function. wang and moult  <cit>  found that the vast majority of nssnps that are related to diseases affect protein stability rather than function. specific factors that determine stability of a protein were then used to predict the effects of nssnps. chen et al.  <cit>  used solvent accessibility of residues to predict deleterious mutations.

support vector machine  has gained popularity over other machine learning methods for interpreting biological data  <cit>  because of their ability to very effectively handle noise and large datasets/input spaces  <cit> . then, some methods  <cit>  have been designed based on the svm  <cit>  to predict the effect of nssnps. capriotti et al.  <cit>  developed a method that depends only on the evolutionary information around the nssnp. peng yue and john moult  <cit>  also proposed a method that uses the conservation and type of residues observed at a base change position within a protein family. karchin et al.  <cit>  and bao et al.  <cit>  introduced two methods based on structural and evolutionary information. the structural information mainly concerns areas in the protein that are buried, as well as the fraction polar secondary structure, solvent accessibility, z-score and buried charge. the evolutionary information mainly uses hidden markov model phc score, hidden markov model relative entropy, sift score and the biochemical difference between the wild-type residue and newly introduced residue.

here, we propose a method that predicts nssnps based on the svm  <cit> . this method, named parepro  uses evolutionary information surrounding an nssnp. in addition, properties from the aaindex  <cit>  and from evolutionary information are combined to determine the dissimilarity between the wild-type and newly introduced residues. parepro predicted the total number of nssnps with higher accuracy than other methods and was not dependent on structural information. in this study, two independent datasets, humvar and newhumvar, taken from the phd-snp server  <cit> , were applied to train the model and test the robustness of parepro, respectively.

effect of the number of homologous sequences on parepro performance
to examine how the number of homologous sequences influenced the performance of parepro, the humvar dataset was split into seven sub datasets  according to the number of homologous sequences, as summarized in table  <dig>  then 20-fold cross-validation test was carried out on every sub datasets. importantly, caution was taken to ensure that every test protein that contained the corresponding nssnp was not included in the training set. as shown in figure  <dig>  the overall accuracy and mcc on sub dataset f <dig> were only about 70% and 36%, respectively. this result indicated that the prediction on the two classes  using sub dataset f <dig> was imbalance and only the major class obtained the better score. however, parepro obtained the highest accuracy on sub dataset f <dig>  which the overall accuracy  was 77% and the mcc was 54%. therefore, these results indicated that the efficacy of parepro for predicting amino acid variants depends on the number of homologous sequences.

reliability index of parepro for nssnp prediction
when machine learning approaches are selected to predict the effects of nssnps on protein function, it is important to know the reliability of the predicted result  <cit> . in this study, a reliability index  was also assigned to a predicted nssnp based on the output of support vector machines that libsvm was used in this work. consider that an output of libsvm with parameter of "-b 1" for a nssnp is o; the ri value is thus computed as: ri = integer)+ <dig>  the ri assignment yields information about the certainty of the classification decision and thus can be used as an indicator of prediction certainty for a particular variant. figure  <dig> shows the expected prediction accuracy and the proportion of the sequences with a given ri value. for example, about 66% of all nssnps had an ri â‰¥  <dig>  and of these nssnps about 88% were correctly predicted. these results are based on the humvar dataset.

comparison of parepro with other methods
we compared parepro with other predictors, hybridmeth  <cit> , polyphen  <cit>  and sift  <cit> . hybridmeth uses the profile and sequence information surrounding a mutation. polyphen  <cit>  is based on a decision tree and takes into account several pieces of information derived by structural parameters, functional annotations, and evolutionary information. sift  <cit>  mainly uses information from homologous sequences.

as shown in table  <dig>  parepro obtained the highest scores with respect to sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy  and matthews correlation coefficient   among the four methods. because there was an obvious disparity in the number of disease-related mutations and the neutral polymorphisms in the dataset, mcc combined both the sensitivity and the specificity of the predictor and should be selected as the main score among the six scores in the evaluation  <cit> . the mcc for parepro was higher by 6%, 17% and 4% compared with the mcc obtained with polyphen, sift and hydridmeth, respectively. furthermore, parepro could predict all mutations in the humvar dataset. by contrast, polyphen and sift could only predict approximately 93% of the amino acid mutations, because these programs require more specific functional or evolutionary information. these results indicate that parepro is a powerful tool for predicting the effect of mutations.

predicted efficacy of parepro on the newhumvar dataset
to test the robustness of parepro and compare it with other methods available on the web, the dataset newhumvar was selected, which includes only new variants submitted to the swiss-prot database. variants that were the same as in the humvar dataset were removed. as shown in table  <dig>  all amino acid mutations in the newhumvar dataset were predicted by parepro. the mcc for parepro was significantly higher than the mccs calculated by hybridmeth, polyphen, and sift. these results indicate that parepro outperformed these other prediction methods.

discussion
predicting phenotypes resulting from nssnps is an important aspect of post-genome biology. the present study helps advance the analysis of genetic variation and may therefore lead to a better understanding of the resulting phenotypic variations among individuals with an aim toward drug design and development  <cit> . two tests using different datasets indicated that parepro outperformed several widely used methods.

unlike the other methods that use the machine learning method  <cit> , parepro was constructed from three attribute sets rd, mi, and ie, all of which incorporate evolutionary information. in general, if the rd between the newly introduced amino acid and the residue in the mutation position has a high value, the substitution would be considered to have a high probability of being deleterious  <cit> . at the same time, attribute sets mi and ie were used to characterize the condition at the mutation position and around the mutation position, respectively. for example, when residues surrounding a mutation were found to be conserved, the region was related to either function or structure  <cit> , and thus the mutation would be deleterious. this information reinforced the characterization provided by rd. moreover, the results indicated that these three attribute sets complemented one another to yield a higher overall accuracy  and matthews correlation coefficient.

the attribute vector of parepro did not contain structural features. thus, it is possible that some of the information directly derived from the protein structure  <cit>  was ignored by parepro. however, the lack of structural information was likely overcome by the inclusion of  <dig> discrete amino acid properties in the rd attribute set, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the sequence-based parepro program.

CONCLUSIONS
we present an svm-based prediction method, parepro, which predicts the effect of nssnps on protein function. comprehensive comparisons of the prediction performance on two datasets showed that parepro, which utilizes information from the amino acids surrounding the mutation position and from the residue difference between the newly introduced amino acid and the average residue in the mutation position, outperformed several other widely used prediction methods. moreover, parepro was able to predict all mutations within two distinct test sets. therefore, we anticipate that parepro will be a useful tool for large-scale analysis of nssnps in genomic databases.
