BACKGROUND
cytokines are central mediators of the immune system. anti-cytokine therapies are aimed at the specific inhibition of a cytokine that has been identified to be critically involved in the initiation, maintenance or progression of a disease. most cytokines signal through heteromeric receptors consisting of two different receptor chains. we have developed a new class of cytokine inhibitors based on the fusion of the ligand-binding domains of cytokine receptors by a flexible linker  <cit> . the prototypic receptor fusion protein  directed against human interleukin- <dig>  turned out to be a highly specific and highly potent inhibitor of hil- <dig>  <cit> . based on this original approach further rfp have been generated by others for the inhibition of human oncostatin m  <cit>  and most recently human interleukin- <dig>  <cit> . in a different but related approach so called cytokine traps have been generated by the fusion of soluble receptors through fc-fragments  <cit> .

for the validation of the rfp approach in murine animal models in vivo rfp directed against murine cytokines are required. rfps based on human receptor proteins are not useful for this purpose because murine cytokines usually do not bind to the human receptors. therefore, we concentrated on the generation of receptor fusion proteins for the inhibition of murine cytokines. we described mlif-rfp  <cit>  for the inhibition of murine leukemia inhibitory factor  and recently mil-6-rfp  <cit>  for the inhibition of murine il- <dig> .

oncostatin m  is a pro-inflammatory cytokine of the il- <dig> family implicated in rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , lung fibrosis  <cit>  and skin disease  <cit> . osm is secreted by activated t-cells  <cit> , macrophages  <cit> , neutrophils  <cit>  and synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . the murine osm receptor consists of two receptor proteins  <cit> , the osm-specific osmr and gp <dig>  the common signalling receptor subunit of the il- <dig> family of cytokines. osm signals through the jak/stat pathway resulting in the activation of stat <dig> and stat <dig>  erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> map kinases are also activated in response to osm  <cit> .

here we describe the generation of a novel inhibitor for murine osm, mosm-rfp, that is based on the fusion of murine osmr and murine gp <dig> fragments. mosm-rfp will be a useful tool for the investigation of the role of osm in murine models of human diseases.

RESULTS
 <dig>  design and expression of murine oncostatin m receptor fusion proteins 
we generated four different murine oncostatin m receptor fusion proteins  . the first protein  is built up in analogy to the recently published receptor fusion protein for the inhibition of murine lif   <cit> . it consists of the four n-terminal domains of the murine osm receptor  and domains d <dig> and d <dig> of murine gp <dig>  connected by a flexible polypeptide linker. we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  have shown that the n-terminal domain d <dig> of gp <dig> is dispensable for signal transduction in response to osm. another report suggests a functional role of d <dig> of gp <dig> in osm-binding  <cit> . moreover, we have shown that the addition of a single domain, even if not involved in ligand-binding, can strongly enhance the expression of a receptor fusion protein  <cit> . therefore, we decided to construct another fusion protein that includes d <dig> of mgp <dig> . to assess the importance of the order of the receptor fragments we also constructed inverted receptor fusion proteins with the mgp <dig> fragment preceding the mosmr fragment .

human embryonic kidney  cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding the four mosm-rfps. supernatants of the cells were concentrated 10-fold and analyzed by western blotting using an antibody directed against the flag-tag of the mosm-rfps. all four proteins were expressed  indicating that neither the presence of d <dig> of gp <dig> nor the order of the receptor fragments has a major influence on protein expression. however, the yield of i-mosm-rfp was always somewhat lower compared to the other fusion proteins. the apparent molecular masses are in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> kda which is in agreement with the expected molecular masses of the glycosylated mosm-rfps.

 <dig>  inhibitory activity and specificity of mosm-rfps
to analyze the activities of the mosm-rfps, murine embryonic fibroblasts  were stimulated with mosm, mlif and mil- <dig> plus murine soluble il- <dig> receptor  in the presence of concentrated supernatants of hek <dig> cells transfected with the expression vectors encoding the mosm-rfps or mock vector. lysates of the mef were analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation of stat <dig> by western blotting . both mosm-rfp and mosm-rfp+d <dig> block the activity of mosm but not of mlif or mil-6/sr indicating that these receptor fusion proteins are specific inhibitors of mosm. most interestingly, the inverted receptor fusion proteins are devoid of any activity under the conditions used in this assay. therefore, in the following experiment only mosm-rfp and mosm-rfp+d <dig> were used.

mef were stimulated with increasing amounts of mosm in the presence of concentrated supernatants of hek <dig> cells transfected with the expression vectors encoding mosm-rfp, mosm-rfp+d <dig> or mock vector. lysates of the mef were analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation of stat <dig> by western blotting . as soon as the mosm concentration exceeds  <dig> ng/ml stat <dig> activation is also detectable in the presence of the mosm-rfps. thus, the tested mosm-rfps are saturable. this speaks for mosm-binding in solution rather than blocking of the membrane-bound cellular receptors by a complex of mosm and osm-rfps. this experiment also shows that mosm-rfp and mosm-rfp+d <dig> have comparable inhibitory activities. no increase in the stat <dig> phosphorylation with increasing mosm concentrations is seen in the mock lanes because at  <dig> ng/ml mosm the cellular response is already saturated.

to test the inhibitory activity of mosm-rfp on sustained stat <dig> activation fao rat hepatoma cells were stimulated with mosm for prolonged periods of times . even after  <dig> h of stimulation mosm-rfp reduces stat <dig> activation to background levels.

 <dig>  mosm-rfp blocks osm-induced nuclear accumulation of stat <dig> and socs <dig> gene induction
two further experiments were performed to analyze whether stat <dig> responses downstream of tyrosine phosphorylation namely stat <dig> nuclear accumulation and stat3-mediated gene induction are blocked by mosm-rfp. mef lacking endogenous stat <dig>  were stably transfected with stat3-egfp. these cells show the typical distribution of latent stat <dig> which is found in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus  <cit>  . upon addition of mosm-rfp the distribution of stat3-egfp does not change. stimulation with mosm leads to rapid nuclear accumulation of stat3-egfp. nuclear accumulation of stat3-egfp is blocked in the presence of mosm-rfp.

the feedback inhibitor socs <dig> is a well established stat <dig> target gene. socs <dig> gene induction in response to mosm was measured by quantitative real-time pcr  . the concentration of mosm-rfp was estimated by western blot titration taking advantage of the known concentration of another flag-tagged protein . therefore, in this and the following assays the molecular ratios of mosm and mosm-rfp could be properly adjusted. at a 10- and 5-fold molar excess mosm-rfp completely inhibits mosm mediated induction of the socs <dig> gene. even at a molecular ratio of 1: <dig> most of the mosm response is blocked by mosm-rfp. thus, mosm-rfp is a specific and potent inhibitor of mosm activity.

 <dig>  comparison of mosm-rfp with a mosm neutralizing antibody
the inhibitory potency of mosm-rfp was compared with a commercially available, affinity-purified neutralizing polyclonal mosm antibody . mef were stimulated with a constant amount of mosm and different concentrations of mosm-rfp . in agreement with the experiment shown before  a 10- to 5-fold molar excess of mosm-rfp is sufficient to block mosm activity. even at a 1: <dig> ratio the stat <dig> phosphorylation is strongly reduced. when a similar experiment is performed with mosm-ab instead of mosm-rfp a 50- to 100-fold molar excess of the antibody is needed to achieve a marked reduction of stat <dig> phosphorylation. thus, mosm-rfp is a much more potent mosm inhibitor than an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody.

 <dig>  analysis of mosm/mosm-rfp complexes by blue-native page
complexes formed between mosm and mosm-rfps were analyzed by blue-native page . for this purpose mosm was preincubated with the four different mosm-rfps in the presence of an excess of bovine serum albumin . proteins and protein complexes were separated by bn-page and analyzed by western blotting with a flag antibody for the detection of the osm-rfps  and after stripping of the blot with a mosm antibody . upon addition of mosm no shifted bands of mosm-rfp and mosm-rfp+d <dig> are visible. however, the bands are weaker in the lanes where mosm has been added .

detection of mosm  reveals that in the presence of mosm-rfp or mosm-rfp+d <dig> the band of mosm is completely shifted to approximately the height of the receptor fusion proteins. mosm is only partially shifted by i-mosm-rfp and i-mosm-rfp+d <dig> but to a much higher apparent molecular mass compared to the free i-mosm-rfps. the receptor fusion proteins are not detectable in the shifted bands. quantitative analysis of the blots revealed that i-mosm-rfp and i-mosm-rfp+d <dig> have a considerably lower capacity in shifting mosm than the mosm-rfps .

to clarify the identities of the bands another bn-page was performed with different concentrations of mosm-rfp and i-mosm-rfp+d <dig>  after blotting of the gel the flag-tags of the fusion proteins and mosm were detected using antibodies with different fluorescent labels. the blots were analyzed using a fluorescence scanner . mosm shifted by mosm-rfp is visible  although the fluorescence detection is not as sensitive as the enhanced chemiluminescence detection  where the mosm shifted by i-mosm-rfp+d <dig> and the non-shifted mosm are also visible. the fluorescence detection of the flag-tag  and the overlay of the two fluorescence detections  reveal that the shifted mosm is of lower electrophoretic mobility than mosm-rfp. apparently, the flag-tag of mosm-rfp is nearly completely masked upon complex formation with mosm so that only very faint bands are visible . from the electrophoretic mobilities and the shift of the bands we conclude that mosm is bound by mosm-rfp or mosm-rfp+d <dig> in a 1: <dig> complex . we propose that mosm binds to dimers of the i-mosm-rfps . a propensity for dimer formation of the i-mosm-rfps is evident from sds-page where the dimers can be detected even under denaturing conditions .

discussion
we developed novel receptor fusion proteins for the inhibition of murine osm. the receptor fusion protein mosm-rfp consisting of domains d1-d <dig> of mosmr connected by a flexible peptide linker to domains d2-d <dig> of mgp <dig> is a potent inhibitor of mosm with respect to stat <dig> phosphorylation , stat <dig> nuclear translocation and stat3-mediated gene induction . addition of d <dig> of mgp <dig> does neither improve protein expression  nor inhibitory activity  confirming that domains d2-d <dig> of gp <dig> are sufficient for complex formation with osm  <cit> . our fusion proteins for the inhibition of murine osm differ from a previously described fusion protein for the inhibition of human osm that consisted of the first  <dig> amino acids of soluble hosmr fused to  <dig> amino acids  of hgp <dig>  <cit> . a more recently published receptor fusion protein for the inhibition of human il- <dig> consisting of d1-d <dig> of hosmr and d1-d <dig> of hil-31r  <cit>  is built up in analogy to our formerly described mlif-rfp  <cit>  and therefore resembles mosm-rfp described in this study. previously described cytokine traps consist of soluble receptors fused to fc-fragments. these cytokine traps require the expression of two genes. after protein expression, homodimers must be separated from the desired heterodimeric proteins  <cit> .

compared to mosm-rfp and mosm-rfp+d <dig> the inverted proteins i-mosm-rfp and i-mosm-rfp+d <dig> are weak osm-binding proteins  and therefore unsuited as inhibitors . this initially puzzling observation might be explained at least in part by the analysis of osm/osm-rfp complexes with bn-page . mosm-rfp and mosm-rfp+d <dig> when bound to mosm form a 1: <dig> complex that is in agreement with the proposed stoichiometry of the osm receptor complex consisting of one molecule of each osm, osmr and gp <dig>  <cit> . when the domains of osmr and gp <dig> are arranged in a way as proposed for the closely related lif receptor complex  it is evident that the c-terminus of domain d <dig> of osmr is much closer to the n-terminus of gp <dig> than the c-terminus of gp <dig> to the n-terminus of osmr. the latter distance is relevant for the inverted mosm-rfps and might be too long to be bridged by the  <dig> amino acid linker used in our fusion proteins. therefore, the complex adopts an alternative conformation of 2: <dig> stoichiometry as shown in figure 6b. apparently, this alternative complex is of lower affinity than the native receptor complex.

gp <dig> is the common receptor subunit of the il- <dig> family of cytokines comprising il- <dig>  osm, lif, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin- <dig>  cardiotrophin-like cytokine and neuropoetin  <cit> . none of these cytokines binds with high affinity to gp <dig> alone. for high affinity-binding a second more specific receptor subunit is required  <cit> . accordingly, mosm-rfp is a mosm-specific inhibitor that does not inhibit the related cytokines mil- <dig> and mlif  that require mil-6r and mlifr, respectively, for high affinity-binding. conversely, the mil- <dig> inhibitor mil-6-rfp and the mlif inhibitor mlif-rfp do not inhibit mosm  <cit> . thus, shared cytokine receptors are useful for the design of specific cytokine inhibitors. for this reason, the receptor fusion protein approach can be applied to the remaining cytokines of the il- <dig> family but also to cytokines that use other shared receptors such as the il- <dig> family and the il- <dig> family of cytokines using the common γ-chain and the common β-chain, respectively. mosm-rfp will be a useful tool to decipher the controversially discussed role of mosm in murine models of inflammatory diseases  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the functional osm-rfps presented in this study and the previously described rfps are highly specific and potent cytokine inhibitors. rfps are encoded by a single gene. this offers an advantage with respect to gene delivery approaches compared to cytokine traps based on soluble receptors fused to fc-tags  <cit>  or antibodies which are composed of two different protein chains. rfps can be conveniently expressed as single gene constructs by viral gene transfer or in transgenic animals. thus, rfps offer numerous possibilities to test the effect of cytokine inhibition in immune responses, in animal models of human diseases and finally in gene therapy.
