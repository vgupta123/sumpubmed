BACKGROUND
pathogenic bacteria rely on a variety of secretion systems to transport virulence factors, proteins that mediate host-pathogen interactions, across their hydrophobic cell membranes to sites where they can interact with the host. gram-positive bacteria need only transport proteins across a single membrane, but gram-negative bacteria require specialized secretion machinery that spans both inner and outer membranes. mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, was recently re-classified as a diderm bacterium when it was shown to have an outer membrane bi-layer — referred to as the mycomembrane — composed largely of mycolic acids  <cit> . in order to transport key virulence factors across both membranes m. tuberculosis has evolved specialized type vii secretion systems . the t7sss were discovered based on attenuated strains of m. tuberculosis deficient in esxa  secretion and are commonly called esat six  secretion systems . in m. tuberculosis there are five gene clusters, named esx- <dig> to esx- <dig>  which encode t7ss. each gene cluster encodes a number of proteins that are either secreted or are building blocks for the secretion apparatus. esx- <dig> is responsible for secretion of the important virulence factors esxa and esxb as well as other virulence-associated proteins  that are secreted to the cell surface or extracellular milieu based on recognition of a conserved c-terminal signal sequence on the secretion substrates . these secreted factors have been linked to mycobacterial virulence through studies of the attenuated bcg strain of m. tuberculosis  <cit> ; in non-pathogenic mycobacterium smegmatis the orthologous esx- <dig> system is involved in conjugation  <cit> . esx- <dig> is critical for mycobacterial survival due to its role in metal acquisition . esx- <dig> is important for the secretion of many members of the pe/ppe family of proteins that also play a role in virulence and cell wall integrity . the functional role of esx- <dig> and esx- <dig> is still unknown although esx- <dig> appears to be the ancestral system from which the other esx systems have evolved  <cit> .

all esx gene clusters contain at least three or four esx conserved components , named eccb, eccc, and eccd, with ecce being present in all esx systems with the exception of esx- <dig>  <cit> . multiple copies of each core protein as well as other t7ss-associated proteins are present in the core complex resulting in a large ~1500 kda particle  <cit> . the function of some core components is known, for example, eccc is a member of the ftsk/spoiiie-like atpase family and provides the energy to transport proteins across the mycobacterial membrane  <cit> . eccd contains an n-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by  <dig> predicted transmembrane helices, and may form the cytoplasmic membrane channel through which cargo proteins are secreted. the functions of eccb and ecce within the secretion apparatus are less clear. these proteins both have n-terminal transmembrane elements and large c-terminal regions predicted bioinformatically to be localized in the periplasm, but their molecular structures and interacting partners remain unknown.

understanding the t7ss architecture is critical for development of new antitubercular agents. currently, no structural data is available for three of the four conserved components eccb, eccd, and ecce. in this study we report the molecular structures of the periplasmic domain of eccb <dig> and the cytoplasmic domain of eccd <dig> from the esx- <dig> cluster. the structures reveal probable functional surfaces of eccb <dig>  and an unexpected dimerization by eccd <dig>  here we describe these structures in detail and how they might fit into the larger context of the t7ss.

RESULTS
structure of eccb1
m. tuberculosis eccb <dig>  is a 51 kda protein containing a  <dig> amino acid  n-terminal domain followed by a single membrane-spanning helix and a ~ <dig> aa c-terminal fold. eccb <dig> is annotated as a protein domain of unknown function  in the pfam database  <cit> . in order to gain further insight into the role of eccb <dig> within the esx machinery we determined the crystal structure of the c-terminal domains of eccb <dig> from m. tuberculosis  to  <dig>  Å resolution and of the orthologous protein  from the nonpathogenic mycobacterial species m. smegmatis to  <dig>  Å resolution. both eccb <dig> structures contain a single elongated fold in the shape of a distorted propeller, which has an unanticipated quasi 2-fold symmetry . a structural comparison of the eccb1mt and eccb1ms structures shows that they are highly similar with an r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å for the superposition of  <dig> amino acids ; there is considerable variability in the conformation of the extensive unstructured loops connecting secondary structure elements which are, themselves, relatively well conserved  five domains are present in the structures including a core domain flanked by two repeat domains on either side. the central core domain consists of a  <dig> stranded β-sheet with  <dig> strands  arranged in anti-parallel fashion with an additional strand  parallel to strand β <dig> on the periphery of the sheet; the sheet is further stabilized by a disulfide bond between the two central strands  of the sheet formed between cys <dig> and cys <dig>  and cys <dig> and cys <dig> . the four repeat domains each contain a  <dig> stranded β sheet and two α helices . repeat  <dig>   and repeat  <dig>   are located between the core domain and the n-terminal transmembrane region while repeat  <dig>   and repeat  <dig>   are located on the opposite side of the core domain distal to the transmembrane region. the interfaces between r1/r <dig> and r2/r <dig> domains are formed by hydrophobic residues on the n-terminal helices of each repeat that fold together with each other and with hydrophobic residues from the proline rich strands downstream of each repeat’s c-terminal helix. the r <dig> and r <dig> domains also pack tightly with the core domain via residues on their n-terminal helices as well as β sheet residues. the tight packing involving residues on either side of multiple repeat domains gives eccb <dig> a stable fold with a continuous hydrophobic core and an elongated pseudo-symmetrical shape.fig.  <dig> overall structure and repeat domains of eccb1mt. a domain organization of eccb <dig>  the predicted transmembrane helix is indicated by a shaded rectangle. the protein variants used for structure determination are shown as horizontal lines. b overall structure of eccb1mt. the structure is shown in cartoon representation with the central core domain in grey and repeats domains r1-r <dig> colored red, orange, green, and blue, respectively. the disulfide bond between cys <dig> and cys <dig> is shown as yellow spheres. c repeat domains r1–r <dig> have a common fold. the isolated repeat domains are shown in the same orientation after superposition of repeats r2-r <dig> on repeat r <dig> using chimera  <cit>

a comparison of the repeat domains of eccb1mt gives clues to the evolution of the protein. pairwise sequence alignments of the repeats shows that r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> show  <dig>   <dig> and 27 % sequence identity, respectively, to r <dig>  pairwise alignments comparing r2–r <dig> to all other repeats revealed that only r <dig> has significant identity to all  <dig> other domains . therefore, it appears that r <dig> is the ancestral domain with r <dig> sharing more conserved features with r <dig> than do either r <dig> or r <dig>  eccb1ms contains a corresponding set of repeats in the same arrangement as seen in eccb1mt: r <dig>  is membrane proximal, r <dig> , the central core domain, r <dig> , and r <dig>  which is distal to the membrane.fig.  <dig> structure-based sequence alignment of repeat domains of eccb1mt. alignment was rendered using espript. amino acid numbering above the alignment refers to the repeat domain r <dig> sequence and indicated secondary structure elements are derived from the repeat domain r <dig> structure



eccb <dig> does not bear significant sequence similarity to any protein of known structure, and dali searches using the complete eccb <dig> structures revealed no proteins with significant structural homology. however, dali searches using only eccb1mt repeat  <dig>  revealed weak homology  to the n-terminal domain of plycb  from streptococcal c <dig> bacteriophage  <cit> . eight plycb monomers assemble into a ring that associates with the bacterial cell wall and facilitate phage egress by tethering the degradative plyca subunit to the bacterial cell wall. the structural similarity between the two proteins and a common localization of both to bacterial cell envelope structures is intriguing but no clues to eccb <dig> function are apparent from our examination of plycb.

structure of eccd1mt
eccd1mt  is a 54 kda protein containing an ~ <dig> amino acid  n-terminal ubiquitin-like domain followed by a  <dig> aa linker and  <dig> closely spaced transmembrane helices at its c-terminus. the ubiquitin-like domain of eccd <dig> classifies it as a member of the yukd family within the pfam database. based on the characteristics of the transmembrane regions the n-terminal portion of eccd <dig> is predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm.

we grew crystals of the predicted cytoplasmic domain of eccd <dig> from m. tuberculosis  which diffracted to  <dig>  Å. however, we could not obtain crystals of se-met containing cyto-eccd1mt and attempts to perform heavy atom soaks of fragile native crystals of cyto-eccd1mt were unsuccessful. therefore, we obtained crystals and determined the structure of cyto-eccd1mt fused to maltose binding protein  at a resolution of  <dig>  Å by molecular replacement using an mbp structure  as the search model  <cit> . we subsequently solved the  <dig>  Å cyto-eccd1mt structure by molecular replacement using the eccd1mt segment of the mbp fusion protein. in both structures eccd1mt residues 20– <dig> adopt an identical ubiquitin-like fold characterized by a β grasp motif and an anti-parallel β sheet with strands in the order  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> . the mbp fusion protein used as a crystallization aid provides additional crystallization contacts, but it does not perturb the fold of cyto-eccd1mt . the two eccd1mt structures are superimposable with an r.m.s.d. of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> residues and a dali z-score of  <dig> .fig.  <dig> structure of the cytoplasmic domain of eccd1mt. a domain organization of eccd <dig>  the predicted transmembrane helices 1– <dig> are indicated by shaded rectangles. the protein construct used for crystallization is shown as a horizontal line. b cyto-eccd1mt monomer in cartoon representation colored in rainbow colors from n-terminus  to c-terminus . the secondary structure elements are labeled. c cyto-eccd1mt dimer in cartoon representation with acidic residues shown in stick representation . d mbp-cyto-eccd1mt dimer in cartoon representation with mbp moieties colored in grey and cyto-eccd1mt domains colored in blue and purple. e a close-up view of the mbp-cyto-eccd1mt dimer. the orientation corresponds to panel c




interestingly, the asymmetric unit of both crystal forms contains two eccd <dig> molecules and in both crystal forms the two eccd <dig> molecules are arranged as a head-to-tail homodimer stabilized by an extensive interface. the interface is formed by interlocking side chains from β strands  <dig> and  <dig> and the n-terminal α-helix of both eccd <dig> molecules  and ~650 Å <dig> of each eccd <dig> molecule  is buried in the interface as calculated with the pisa webserver  <cit> . the interaction is stabilized by  <dig> hydrogen bonds and a cluster of buried hydrophobic residues including met <dig>  val <dig>  and val <dig> resulting in a solvation energy of − <dig>  kcal/mol and a complex significance score of  <dig>  calculated by the pisa server. the extensive nature of the interface and its re-occurrence in both crystal forms, with or without the mbp fusion, suggests that eccd <dig> is a natural homodimer.

dimerization of cyto-eccd1mt creates a wide open-ended groove bordered on two sides by the α1/β <dig> loops . the floor of the groove is formed by the two α helices. notably, the dimerization interface brings acidic residues  from both chains into this groove. these acidic residues are not offset by the presence of any basic residues in this region thus they create a highly negative surface .fig.  <dig> dimerization of cyto-eccd1mt creates a negatively charged groove. a cyto-eccd1mt dimer is shown in cartoon representation underneath a semitransparent surface. clustered acidic residues are shown in stick representation. b electrostatic surface calculated using the apbs server  <cit>  with protonation states at ph  <dig>  assigned by propka  <cit> . the surface was colored +10 ev  to −10 ev 



putative function of eccb <dig> and eccd1
mutations in eccb <dig> of the esx- <dig> secretion system have been shown to confer drug resistance in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . the mutations found to confer resistance  occur in the small cytoplasmic domain preceding the transmembrane element of eccb <dig>  a region not present in our eccb <dig> constructs which contain the soluble periplasmic domain. the fact that mutations in this region confer drug resistance indicates an important function for this short region perhaps in mediating interactions with other cytoplasmically exposed components of the t7ss. the elongated shape and continuous hydrophobic core of eccb <dig> suggest that it may serve a structural role – perhaps forming part of a structure that spans the inner and outer membrane components of the esx secretion system. the structural similarities between plycb, the viral cell wall binding protein complex, and eccb <dig> hints that eccb <dig> may also bind elements of the peptidoglycan layer, but there is not yet any experimental data to support this idea. however, post-translational modification of secreted bacterial proteins with o-linked polysaccharides has been shown to be important for solubility or maintaining subcellular localization to the cell wall  <cit> . eccb <dig> contains  <dig> putative glycosylation sites, as predicted by the netoglyc webserver  <cit> , and many of these are surface-exposed in the eccb <dig> structures . while this manuscript was under preparation, the atpase activity of eccb <dig> has been reported  <cit> . further studies are needed to define the precise role of eccb <dig> in the context of a functional esx- <dig> secretion complex.

the dimerization of the cytoplasmic domain of eccd <dig> raises interesting possibilities regarding the nature of the transmembrane pore. each eccd <dig> monomer has  <dig> transmembrane elements thus a dimer would have a total of  <dig> transmembrane elements. each monomer may form an independent pore resulting in a pair of closely associated channels, or the transmembrane elements may comprise a single, larger, transmembrane channel. the cytoplasmic domain itself is connected to the first transmembrane element by a  <dig> amino acid linker that may facilitate protein-protein interactions, either with the cytoplasmic eccd <dig> domain or other components of the secretion system, or it may simply form an extended tether allowing increased mobility of the ubiquitin-like domains.

the negatively charged groove of the eccd <dig> dimer indicates that it should associate with a positively charged partner. it may act to recruit other t7ss components or secretion substrates with positively charged patches into the system, or it may be part of a gating element required to close the channel during periods of inactivity. the residues contributing to the negatively charged groove are not conserved in eccd <dig> homologs from other esx systems indicating that they may serve a system-specific role. indeed, the esx- <dig> locus encodes a variety of secretion substrates not found in the paralogous m. tuberculosis esx systems and thus it is likely that the esx- <dig> system has structural adaptations to enable the secretion of these substrates . as more structures of esx- <dig> components are determined likely partners for interaction with the eccd <dig> dimer may be revealed.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have determined the structures of soluble domains of two integral, conserved components, eccb <dig> and eccd <dig>  of the esx- <dig> secretion channel. given the importance of the esx- <dig> secretion system to mycobacterial virulence, our structures provide crucial information about the molecular makeup of this important protein complex that will aid future drug development efforts.
