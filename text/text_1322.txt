BACKGROUND
a major challenge of post genomic biology is to understand the networks of interacting genes, proteins and small molecules that produce biological functions. the large number of protein interactions  <cit> , generated by large-scale experimental methods  <cit> , computational methods  <cit> , and integrated approaches  <cit> , provides opportunities and challenges in annotating protein functions, protein-protein interactions  and domain-domain interactions , and in modeling the cellular signaling and regulatory networks. an approach based on evolutionary cross-species comparisons, such as pathblast  <cit>  and interologs , is a valuable framework for addressing these issues. however, these methods often cannot respond how a protein interacts with another one across multiple species.

protein data bank   <cit>  stores three-dimensional  structure complexes, from which physical interacting domains can be identified to study ddis and ppis using comparative modeling  <cit> . some ddi databases, such as 3did  <cit> , ipfam  <cit> , and dapid  <cit> , have recently been derived from pdb. additionally, some methods have utilized template-based methods , which search a 3d-complex library to identify homologous templates of a pair of query protein sequences, in order to predict the protein-protein interactions by accessing interface preference, and score query pair protein sequences according to how they fit the known template structures. however, these methods  <cit>  are time-consuming to search all possible protein-protein pairs in a large genome-scale database . for example, the possible protein-protein pairs on the uniprot database  are about  <dig> × <dig> <cit> . in addition, these methods are unable to form homologous ppis to explore the protein-protein evolution for a specific structure template.

to address these issues, we proposed a new concept "3d-domain interolog mapping" : for a known 3d-structure complex , domain a  interacts with domain b  in one species. homolog families a' and b' of a and b are proteins, which are significant sequence similarity blastp e-values ≤10- <dig> and contain domains a and b, respectively. all possible protein pairs between these two homolog families are considered as protein-protein interaction candidates using the template t. based on this concept, protein sequence databases can be searched to predict protein-protein interactions across multiple species efficiently. when the genome was deciphered completely for a species, we considered the rank of protein-protein interaction candidates in each species into our previous scoring system  <cit>  to reduce a large number of false positives. the 3d-interologs database which can indicate interacting domains and contact residues in order to visualize molecular details of a protein-protein interaction. additionally, this database can provide couple-conserved residues and evolutionary clues of a query sequence and its partners by examining the interologs across multiple species.

methods and materials
after 3d-dimer template library and template profiles were built, we inferred candidates of interacting proteins by 3d-domain interolog mapping. to identify the interacting-protein candidates against protein sequences in the uniprot version  <dig>  , the chain profile was used as the initial position-specific score matrix  of psi-blast in each template consisting of two chains . the number of iterations was set to  <dig>  therefore, this search procedure can be considered as a profile-to-sequence alignment. a pairing-protein sequence  was considered as a protein-protein interaction candidate if the sequence identity exceeded 30% and the aligned contact residue ratio  was greater than  <dig>  for both alignments . for each interacting candidate, the scoring function was applied to calculate the interacting score and the z-value, which indicates the statistic significance of the interacting score. an interacting candidate was regarded as a protein-protein interaction if its z-value was above  <dig>  and it ranked in the top  <dig> in one species. the candidate rank was considered in one species to reduce the ill-effect of the out-paralogs that arose from a duplication event before the speciation  <cit> . these inferred interacting protein pairs were collected in the database.

finally, for the hit interacting partner derived from 3d-domain interolog mapping, this database provides functional annotations  annotations  <cit> , fig. 2d), and the visualization of the binding models and interaction evolutions  between the query protein and its partners. we then constructed two multiple sequence alignments of the query protein and its interacting partner  across multiple species. here, the interacting-protein pair with the highest z-score in a species was chosen as interologs for constructing multiple sequence alignments using a star alignment. the chains  of the hit structure template were considered as the centers, and all selected interacting-protein pairs across species were aligned to respective chains of the template by psi-blast. the 3d-interologs database annotates the important contact residues in the interface according to the following formats: hydrogen-bond residues ; conserved residues , conserved residues with hydrogen bonds  and other .

data sets
two data sets were used to assess 3d-domain interolog mapping and the scoring functions. to determine the contribution of a residue to the binding affinity, the alanine- scanning mutagenesis is frequently used as an experimental probe. we selected  <dig> mutated  residues from the asedb  <cit>  with  <dig> heterodimers whose 3d structures were known. those mutated residues are contact residues and positioned at protein-protein interfaces. asedb gives the corresponding delta g value representing the change in free energy of binding upon mutation to alanine for each experimentally mutated residue. residues that contribute a large amount of binding energy are often labeled as hot spots.

in addition, we selected a non-redundant set , comprising  <dig> dimer protein structures from the set nr <dig> to evaluate the performance of our scoring functions for predicting ppis in s. cerevisiae and in  <dig> species collected in integr <dig> database .

scoring dunction and matrices
we have recently proposed a scoring function to determine the reliability of a protein- protein interaction  <cit> . this study enhances this scoring by dividing the template consensus score into the template similar score and the couple-conserved residue score. based on this scoring function, the 3d-interologs database can provide the interacting evolution across multiple species and the statistic significance , the binding models and functional annotations between the query protein and its interacting partners. the scoring function is defined as

etot = evdw + esf + esim + wecons 

where evdw and esf are the interacting van der waals energy and the special interacting bond energy , respectively; and esim is the template interface similar score; and the econs is couple-conserved residue score. the optimal w value was yielded by testing various values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; w is set to  <dig> for the best performance and efficiency on predicting binding affinity  and predicting ppis in s. cerevisiae and in  <dig> species  using the data set nr-  <dig>  the evdw and esf are given as  

where cp denotes the number of the aligned-contact residues of proteins a and b aligned to a hit template; vssij and vsbij  are the sidechain-sidechain and sidechain-backbone van der waals energies between residues i  and j , respectively. tssij and tsbij  are the sidechain-sidechain and sidechain-backbone special interacting energies between i and j, respectively, if the pair residues i and j form the special bonds  in the template structure. the van der waals energies  and special interacting energies  were calculated from the four knowledge-based scoring matrices , namely sidechain- sidechain  and sidechain-backbone van der waals scoring matrices ; and sidechain-sidechain  and sidechain-backbone special-bond scoring matrices .

these four knowledge-based matrices, which were derived using a general mathematical structure  <cit>  from a nonredundant set of  <dig> 3d-dimer complexes proposed by glaser et al. <cit> , are the key components of the 3d-interologs database for predicting protein-protein interactions. this dataset is composed of  <dig> heterodimers and  <dig> homodimers and the sequence identity is less than 30% to each other. the entry , which is the interacting score for a contact residue i, j pair , of a scoring matrix is defined as  where qij and eij are the observed probability and the expected probability, respectively, of the occurrence of each i, j pair. for sidechain-sidechain van-der waals scoring matrix, the scores are high  if large-aliphatic residues  interact to large-aliphatic residues or aromatic residues  interact to aromatic residue. in contrast, the scores are low  when nonpolar residues interact to polar residues. the top two highest scores are  <dig>   and  <dig>  .

the value of esim was calculated from the blosum <dig> matrix  <cit>  based on two alignments between two chains  of the template and their homologous proteins , respectively. the esim is defined as   

where cp is the number of contact residue pairs in the template; i and j are the contact residue in chains a and b, respectively. kii' is the score of aligning residue i  to i'  and kji' is the score of aligning residue j  to j'  according to blosum <dig> matrix. kii and kjj are the diagonal scores of blosum <dig> matrix for residues i and j, respectively. the couple-conserved residue score  was determined from two profiles of the template and is given by   

where cp is the number of contact residue pairs; mip is the score in the pssm for residue type i at position p in protein a; mp is the score in the pssm for residue type j at position p' in protein b, and kii and kjj are the diagonal scores of blosum <dig> matrix for residue types i and j, respectively.

to evaluate statistical significance  of the interacting score of a protein-protein interaction candidate, we randomly generated  <dig>  interfaces by mutating 60% contact residues for each heterodimer in 3d-dimer template library. the selected residue was substituted with another amino acid residue according to the probability derived from these  <dig> complexes  <cit> . the mean and standard deviation for each 3d-dimer were determined from these  <dig>  random interfaces which are assuming to form a normal distribution. based on the mean and standard deviation, the z-value of a protein-protein candidate predicted by this template can be calculated.

difference between 3d-interologs and previous works
some enhancements and modifications were applied to the dapid database  <cit>  and the 3d-partner server  <cit> , thereby improving the reliability and applicability of the 3d- interologs method. there are five main differences between the 3d-interologs and our previous works . first, 3d-interologs and 3d-partner integrates knowledge-based scoring matrices and couple-conserved residue scores for measuring binding affinity and interface evolution of homologous ppis to replace the homologous score in dapid. second, 3d-interologs considered the homolog families a' and b' of chains a and b of a template as significant sequence similarity blastp e-value ≤10- <dig>  the threshold is e-value ≤10- <dig> applied in the 3d-partner server and dapid utilized the e-value as the scoring function. third, 3d-interologs utilized a new method for scoring the template interface similar score. furthermore, 3d-interologs added a top ranked strategy for a specific species whose genome is deciphered completely. finally, 3d-interologs and dapid are databases, conversely, 3d- partner is a web-based service for identifying interacting partners of a query protein sequence.

inputs and outputs
the 3d-interologs database server is easy-to-use. users input the uniprot ac or the fasta format of the query protein . the server generally returns a list of interacting partners with functional annotations   and provides the visualization of the binding model and contact residues between the query protein and its partner by aligning them to respective template sequences and structures. additionally, the 3d-interologs system indicates the interacting evolution analysis by using multiple sequence alignments of the interologs across multiple species . the significant contact residues in the interface are indicated. if java is installed in the user's browser, then the output shows the structures, and users can dynamically view the binding model, interacting domains and important residues in the browser.

RESULTS
database
the 3d-interologs database currently contains  <dig>  species and  <dig>  protein-protein interactions, including  <dig>  interactions  derived from our method based on 3d- domain interolog mapping and  <dig>  interactions  summarized from the intact database  <cit> . for the hit interacting partner derived from 3d-domain interolog mapping, this database provides functional annotations  annotations  <cit> ), and the visualization of the binding models and interaction evolutions between the query protein and its partners. on the other hand, the 3d-interologs database presents only the functional annotations of the hit protein-protein interaction if this interaction was summarized from the intact database.

among  <dig>  species in the 3d-interologs database, table  <dig> shows  <dig> species commonly used in molecular research projects, such as homo sapiens, mus musculus, rattus norvegicus, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and escherichia coli. to analyze couple-conserved residues and interface evolutions for providing evolutionary clues, the  <dig>  species were divided into  <dig> taxonomic groups  <cit> , namely mammalia, vertebrata, metazoa, invertebrata, fungi, plant, bacteria, archaea, viruses, and others.

example analysis
the protein nxt <dig> interacts with the protein nxf <dig> to form a compact heterodimers and an interacting β surface, which is lined with hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues . twenty hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions are formed in this compact interface. the salt bridge formed by nxt <dig> arg <dig> and nxf <dig> asp <dig> is especially important in the interface  <cit> . the interacting evolution analysis built by  <dig> interologs reveals that two residues  are conserved in all species . additionally, some interacting residues forming the hydrogen bonds are also couple- conserved, for example nxt <dig> asp <dig> and nxf <dig> arg440; nxt <dig> gln <dig> and nxf <dig> ser417; nxt <dig> pro <dig> and nxf <dig> asn <dig>  <cit> . the evolution of interaction is valuable to reflect both couple-conserved and critical residues in the binding site.

conversely, some positions, which are not conserved in all species but conserved in an individual taxonomic group, are important for observing the co-evolution across multiple species. the interacting residue pair  in mammalia and vertebrata is different from that in metazoan . the van-der waals potential  between leu and met is much larger than the potential  between cys and phe. this co-evolution favors the formation of the hydrophobic interaction in metazoan.

binding affinity prediction
the enhanced scoring functions were first evaluated on  <dig> mutated residues selected from the asedb database  <cit>  to reveal the pearson correlations between ddg values and predicted energies. the 3d-interologs method applied four scoring functions , including 3d- interologs , 3d-partner , esim  and one matrix  proposed by lu, et al. <cit> . among these four scoring functions, the 3d-interologs is the best  and one matrix is the worst . the correlations are  <dig>  and  <dig>  for 3d-partner and  <dig>  , respectively.

the binding free energy is often not evenly distributed across interfaces but involves a small subset of “hot spots” contributed extraordinarily high energy  <cit> . for instance, the human blood-coagulation complex  has  <dig> residues whose energy contribution was probed by alanine scanning mutagenesis  <cit> . among these  <dig> residues, residues lys- <dig> and asp- <dig>  which are highly conserved in many species, provide the binding free energy upper  <dig> kcal/mol; on the other hand, the average energy contribution of the other  <dig> residues is  <dig>  kcal/mol. this result implies that the couple-conserved residue score  is beneficial to model the binding energy of residues positioned in the interfaces. although the hotspots of protein-protein binding are often for maintaining their function, the antibodies keep the diversity to recognize a wide variation of antigens. the correlation is  <dig>  when the econs was used to model the binding energy of antigen-antibody complexes. fortunately, integrating econs, esim and esf is able to improve the correlation to  <dig>  for antigen-antibody complexes.

interactions prediction in s. cerevisiae
additionally, a non-redundant set , comprising  <dig> dimer complexes from the 3d-dimer library, was adopted to evaluate the performance of this enhanced scoring function for interacting partner predictions in s. cerevisiae. this set comprised  <dig>  protein-protein interactions, which were recorded as the core subset in the dip database as the positive cases, and  <dig> , <dig> non-interacting protein pairs, defined by jansen et al. <cit>  as the negative cases. figure 6a shows the roc curves of our method and other three scoring functions for predicting ppis in s. cerevisiae. among these four scoring functions, the 3d-interologs and the template similar score  were the best and achieved the similar accuracy. conversely, one matrix  was the worst. the average precisions, which was calculated as , where  denotes the number of compounds in a hit list including i correct hits, were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  for one matrix . these results demonstrated that the proposed new scoring function can achieve good agreement for the binding affinity in ppis and provide statistical significance  for predicting ppis.

interactions prediction on multiple species
to evaluate the performance of the 3d-domain interolog mapping on multiple species,  <dig> non-redundant dimer complexes  were used as queries to search on the integr <dig> database  which comprises  <dig> , <dig> proteins in  <dig> species . the integr <dig> is an integrated database for organisms with completely deciphered genomes, which are mainly obtained from the non-redundant sets of uniprot entries. experimentally determined protein-protein interactions dataset were collected from intact  <cit>  as the gold standard positive set . the gold standard negative set was generated according to the assumption that two proteins acting in the same biological process are more likely to interact than two proteins involved in different processes  <cit> . this study applied the relative specificity similarity , proposed by wu et al. <cit> , to measure the biological process similarity and the location similarity of two proteins based on the go terms of the biological process  and the cellular component , which describes locations at levels of subcellular structures and macromolecular complexes, respectively. among  <dig>  interactions recorded in the intact database,  <dig>  interactions can be used to calculate the bp and the cc rss scores. the bp and cc rss scores of  <dig> % and  <dig> % interactions, respectively, are less than  <dig> . here, we considered an interacting protein pair as a negative ppi if its cc rss score is less than  <dig> .

the structures in the nr- <dig> as queries to search the integr <dig> database yielded  <dig>  protein-protein interactions recorded in the intact database and  <dig>  protein pairs, whose cc rss scores were less than  <dig>  as the negative cases. based on roc curves  for predicting ppis in  <dig> species, 3d-interologs and the template similar score  outperform the 3d-partner server and one-matrix  method. in addition, the precision and recall were adopted to access the predicted quality of the 3d-interologs using these four scoring schemes . the precision was defined as ah/, where ah and fh denote the numbers of hit positive cases and hit negative cases, respectively. the recall was defined as ah/a, where a is the total number of positives . furthermore, the accuracy of our scoring function  is significantly better than that of the sequence identity .

the 3d-domain interolog mapping may yield many ppi candidates  for one species from a structure template because a eukaryote genome frequently contains multiple paralogous genes. here, we proposed a top-rank strategy to limit the number of ppis inferred from a structural template in the same species. for example, we discarded the ppi candidates whose ranks ≥  <dig> for a species if the rank threshold is set to  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that the performance of the top-rank scores  is similar to that of using z-score scoring method . when we combined the top-rank strategy and the z-score scoring methods, the precisions  are significantly improved. the precision was  <dig>  and the recall was  <dig>  when z-score >  <dig>  and the rank ≤ <dig> in one species.

adopting the top-rank strategy in one species as the scoring function is useful for distinguishing between positives and negatives when the 3d-domain interolog mapping yielded many protein-protein interactions for one species from a structure template. however, the rank cannot reflect the binding affinity of a ppi candidate, conversely, the z-score cannot be adopted to identify the orthologs and in-paralogs arising from a duplication event following the speciation  <cit> . these results reveal that z-scores and ranks scoring methods are complementary.

3d-interologs infers  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative protein-protein interactions by human calcineurin heterodimer , including calmodulin-dependent calcineurin a subunit alpha isoform  and calcineurin subunit b type  <dig> , searching on integr <dig> database.
a ppi is a positive  or negative case .
b,c the relative specificity similarity  scores, proposed by wu et al. <cit> , of gene ontology biological
process  and cellular component , respectively. d the protein pair is without gene ontology annotations in bp or cc.

CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrates that the 3d-interologs database is robust and feasible for the interacting evolution of ppis and ddis across multiple species. this database can provide couple-conserved residues, interacting models and interface evolution through 3d-domain interolog mapping and template-based scoring functions. the scoring function achieves good agreement for the binding affinity in protein-protein interactions. we believe that the 3d- domain interolog mapping should be useful in protein-protein interacting evolution and is able to infer reliable physical protein-protein interactions across multiple genomes.
