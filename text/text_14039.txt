BACKGROUND
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  inhibit cyclooxygenase  activity and the local production of cox products that affect inflammation  <cit> . nevertheless, the role of nsaids in several biologic pathways, at high doses, has been questioned  <cit> . some nsaids have been shown to be cancer preventive  <cit> . the role of cox in cancer prevention is suggested by the findings that cox is overexpressed in tumors and that pge <dig> levels are increased in tumors. cox independent mechanisms for cancer prevention have been shown by rigas and collaborators  <cit> .

based on the stimulation of aa release by several known cancer preventive agents, e.g., tamoxifen, 9-cis-retinoic acid, vitamin d <dig>  statins, anti-oxidants found in green tea and red wine, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligands, i have proposed that aa release by cells is associated with cancer prevention  <cit> . celecoxib, a cox inhibitor, releases aa from rat liver, human colon carcinoma, and rat glial cells in culture. three of these cells, rat liver , the human colon cancer  and rat glia  express cox  <cit> . the human colon carcinoma cell line  does not produce prostaglandins  when treated with know stimulators of pg synthesis such as mellitin, a- <dig>  fetal bovine serum or exogenous aa. nor do these cells express cox as measured by northern blotting . in this report, evidence is presented that nsaids and other cancer preventive agents release aa from these hct- <dig> cells.

primary cultures of gastric mucosal cells undergo necrosis as well as apoptosis after incubation with nsaids  <cit> . thus, the effects of nsaids on the morphology of sheep erythrocytes , cells that also do not express cox  <cit>  were also examined using lysis as an indicator of membrane perturbation and necrosis. some nsaids as well as tamoxifen and simvastatin hemolyze the washed cox negative srbc. several of the nsaids are known to intercalate the plasma membrane of cells  <cit> .

RESULTS
preliminary experiments showed that the release of aa from hct- <dig> cells by  <dig> μm celecoxib was complete after a  <dig> h incubation. the release of aa from these cells by the cox inhibitors, celecoxib  and ns <dig> , is shown in table  <dig>  celecoxib is more effective than ns <dig> at comparable doses. the concentration dependencies of the release by celecoxib, sulindac sulfide, indomethacin and ibuprofen are shown in fig.  <dig>  celecoxib is  <dig> to  <dig> times more effective than ibuprofen, and more effective than sulindac sulfide or indomethacin. in contrast to the observations presented in this report, indomethacin,  <dig> μm, inhibited unstimulated aa release from rabbit kidney slices 50%  <cit> . at  <dig> μm, indomethacin did not inhibit aa release from perfused rabbit kidney after a  <dig> h incubation, but did inhibit its rate of release after incubation with angiotensin ii  <cit> . in our studies, indomethacin stimulates aa release from unstimulated human colon carcinoma , rat liver , rat glial   <cit>  and human colon carcinoma .

the dose-dependencies of aa release by tamoxifen and simvastatin as well as those of thapsigargin and tetrandrine are shown in fig.  <dig>  thapsigargin is active even at  <dig>  μm. it stimulates aa release from ht- <dig> cells  <cit>  and induces apoptosis in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line  <cit> . its analogs exhibit chemoprevention of androgen-independent prostate cancer  <cit> . thapsigargin also induces apoptosis of human neuroblastoma, colon cancer and thymocytes  <cit> . tetrandrine stimulates aa release from ht- <dig> cells  <cit>  and is known to induce apoptosis and is chemopreventive  <cit> . the dose-response curve of tetrandrine is markedly more shallow than those of the nsaids examined and suggests a different mechanism of aa release.

the insolubility of several of these drugs precludes generation of extensive dose-response curves at high concentrations. at concentrations at which they were soluble, they release a significant amount of aa . the concentrations of nsaids required for release of aa are greater than those required to inhibit cox as measured by pgi <dig> production of lactacystin plus tpa stimulated cox positive rat liver cells . indomethacin,  <dig> μm, significantly stimulates aa release from the hct- <dig> cells, but  <dig>  μm,  <dig> orders of magnitude less, is required to inhibit  <dig> % of pgi <dig> produced by different cells  stimulated by lactacystin plus tpa treatment. cox-inhibition depends on several factors including time of incubation, cellular source of the cox, stimulator of the cox , subcellular location of the cox, concentration of substrate and the degree of cox-pla <dig> coupling. for example, the ic <dig> for cox- <dig> inhibition of pg production by indomethacin when treated with endotoxin-stimulated broken macrophage was  <dig>  μm, but when assayed with purified enzyme, it was  <dig> μm  <cit> .

a low concentration of srbc  was used to quantitate hemolysis  <cit>  after incubation of these cox negative cells with several nsaids, tamoxifen or simvastatin. hemolysis by celecoxib  and tamoxifen  is shown in table  <dig>  the concentration dependencies for hemolysis by celecoxib, sulindac sulfide, indomethacin and ibuprofen are shown in fig.  <dig>  as with aa release , celecoxib is the most effective. treatment of cells with tamoxifen and simvastatin also hemolyze the srbc . tetrandrine or thapsigargin, even when tested at  <dig> mm and  <dig> μm respectively do not lyse the srbc , suggesting that the mechanisms of aa release by tetrandrine and thapsigargin differs from that of nsaids, tamoxifen or simvastatin.

when the effect of cell density on hemolysis was tested with celecoxib, tamoxifen or simvastatin, the number of cells lysed was higher at the lower cell densities . under the experimental conditions described, an approximate number of molecules of drug required to hemolyze  <dig>  ×  <dig> srbc was calculated . these values may be grossly overestimated since binding to the  <dig> % bovine serum albumin  in the vehicle was not considered.

discussion
in contrast to ht- <dig> cells which are known to be cox dependent, hct- <dig> cells do not respond to known stimulants of cox activity, such as mellitin, a- <dig>  fetal bovine serum or even exogenous aa  <cit> . nor are transcripts of mrna from both cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> genes detected in these hct- <dig> cells  <cit> . when measured by confocal microscopy, however, cox is detected in these hct- <dig> cells  <cit> . a study of aa release by the cox-null embryo fibroblasts described by zhang et al  <cit>  would be informative and provide another cox negative cell for study. although erythrocytes, are cox negative  <cit> , they may express lipoxygenase . sulindac sulfide and indomethacin stimulate aa release from the colorectal cancer cell lines, sw <dig> and hct- <dig>  it is the aa release per se that leads to apoptosis  <cit> . chan et al  <cit>  have suggested that inhibition of cox is a mechanism of action of nsaids. by inhibiting cox, more aa is made available as substrate for sphingomyelin to ceramide conversion. i have proposed that the release of aa is associated with cancer prevention  <cit> . the aa release was observed from cox positive rat liver , cox positive human colon cancer  and cox positive rat glioma  cells. growth of cox negative and cox positive cells is inhibited and their progression to apoptosis is increased by nsaids  <cit> . in cells different than those cited above, others have demonstrated cox independence for nsaid actions .

red blood cells do not express cox activity  <cit> , yet incorporate aa into their phospholipids. after a  <dig> min incubation with the ca2+ ionophore, a- <dig>   <dig> % the aa is found unesterified when analyzed by high pressure liquid and thin layer chromatography  <cit> . in the present study, hemolysis is observed after a  <dig> h incubation of srbc with nsaids, tamoxifen or simvastatin. celecoxib is about  <dig> times more effective than ibuprofen . the relative activities of celecoxib, rofecoxib and valdecoxib for the necrotic stage of the actions of nsaids, as measured by hemolysis of srbc, may be associated with an unwanted side reaction. the hemolysis suggests a mechanism proposed much earlier  <cit>  for the effects of nsaids on a variety of biological pathways, namely, perturbation of the cell membranes and disruption of normal signaling pathways . the deesterification of phospholipids could lead to altered signaling. it is not restricted to nsaids. even at high concentrations, aa release is stimulated by tamoxifen. it is independent of estrogen synthesis  <cit> . the stimulation of aa release by simvastatin is independent of cholesterol synthesis  <cit> . simvastatin also hemolyzes srbc . the significant correlation between high doses of statins and bone fractures  <cit>  may reflect intercolated cell membranes of cells relevant to bone integrity, i.e. the biological response to high doses of such drugs may depend on the function of the target cell.

cox inhibitors leading to decreased aa metabolism may be the primary pathway for combating pain. the perturbation of the membrane and the accompanying changes in signaling may be responsible for many of their other biological effects, including cancer chemoprevention, reduction of amyloid production in alzheimer disease  <cit>  and possibly even production of lesions in the gastric mucosa  <cit> . it would be of interest to assess epidemiologically other conditions that may be affected by exposure to high doses of nsaids, e.g., cardiotoxicity. the effects of these agents do not appear to be selective to cancer cells.

the numerous findings of overexpression of cox- <dig> and elevated pge <dig> levels in cancer as well as the genetic evidence  have lead to the concept that cox- <dig> is a primary target for cancer prevention. alternatively, the effects on cancer prevention observed with nsaids and some other agents may result from the stimulation of aa release followed by the altered downstream signaling. lypooxygenase  and lox products  are up-regulated in human pancreatic cancer. inhibitors of lox induce apoptosis in these human pancreatic cell lines . since lox activity was not examined in the hct- <dig> cells, the possibility that lox is a target for the nsaids cannot be ruled out. lox activity is present in the srbc undergoing hemolysis but the effect of nsaids on the production of lox products was not studied.

the majority of the compounds tested for release of aa from cells in culture are effective at concentrations of  <dig> μm or greater. such concentrations are significantly higher than those found in patients receiving i.e., indomethacin,  <dig> μm, based on serum levels. however, based only on serum levels, estimations of ligand concentration effective on the target cells can be misleading. for example, sulindac sulfide levels may be 20-fold higher in colonic epithelial cells of guinea pigs than in serum  <cit> . in addition, comparison of the effects of drug concentrations in cell cultures and in humans is subject to inherent experimental differences. high doses of nsaids are used in cell culture experiments while low doses may be effective in man. in cell culture experiments the time of incubation of cells with nsaids is of necessity relatively short whereas in patients, the effects are usually observed after much longer periods of time of exposure, sometimes years. the physiological relevance of the high levels of nsaids found in vitro has been addressed in recent reviews  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a cell that does not express cox activity  releases aa when incubated with nsaids and cancer preventive agents. cox negative srbc also undergo lysis when incubated with nsaids, tamoxifen or simvastatin suggesting that the mechanism of action of these drugs involves their intercalation of the membrane and disruption of signaling messages.
