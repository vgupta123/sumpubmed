BACKGROUND
many microorganisms continuously face a range of reactive oxygen species  including hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and the hydroxyl radical derived from many sources. during the process of active infection, pathogenic bacteria are exposed to exogenous oxidative stress that phagocytes utilize as a host defense mechanism  <cit> . even normal cellular metabolism produces cytotoxicity arising from its partially-reduced intermediates  <cit> . for instance, by reacting with intracellular iron, hydrogen peroxide can form the hydroxyl radical through the fenton reaction, which damages various cellular molecules including lipids, proteins, and dna  <cit> . superoxide is also capable of promoting oxidative damage by increasing the concentration of intracellular iron  <cit> . because of the vast array of stimuli and their sources, it is intuitive to anticipate that organisms have developed complex antioxidant strategies that serve to neutralize and repair oxidative damage.

pseudomonas aeruginosa pa <dig> , a gram-negative pathogen responsible for respiratory infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis and cancer, is also known to possess a multifaceted defense system against reactive oxidants that includes such enzymes as catalase and superoxide dismutase  <cit> . there are many specific defense genes that have been identified and regulatory aspects of their activities have been elucidated in many cases  <cit> . despite this marked progress, cystic fibrosis remains problematic and our knowledge of p. aeruginosa pathogenicity remains incomplete. a more thorough understanding of this bacterium's defense system might serve to enhance the development and efficacy of therapeutic agents for this disease. in particular, an understanding of the linkage between the cell's ros defense mechanism and the remainder of the cell's metabolism can lead to more innovative methods for combating this pathogen. for example, better elucidation of the molecular events responsible for establishing and maintaining pathogenicity might improve optimal drug and vaccine design  <cit> . that is, by using microarray analysis that enables us to simultaneously and globally examine the complete transcriptome during cellular responses, we might reinforce known relationships between genes with previously identified functions, and also reveal new target genes that give us more insight into p. aeruginosa-host interactions.

to provide a more complete linkage between cell physiology and the well-characterized defense response, we investigated genome-wide changes in p. aeruginosa gene transcription upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide using affymetrix p. aeruginosa genechip arrays. notably, we made a significant finding that hydrogen peroxide induced the transcription of each and every pyocin  reported in p. aeruginosa. moreover, we found that a pyocin immunity gene, which prevents bacterial cell death during pyocin synthesis, was downregulated, possibly leading to self-killing activity. finally, we've corroborated an anticipated result regarding iron uptake; that oxidative stress in our experimental conditions lead to the repression of iron uptake genes.

RESULTS
to investigate the effect of sublethal oxidative stress on p. aeruginosa, we performed a transcriptome analysis with microarrays upon  <dig> min exposure to  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide. this concentration successfully induces sublethal oxidative damage in escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa  <cit> . besides providing requisite quantities of mrna for microarray analyses, sublethal doses of antibiotics are receiving increased interest because of their potential for attenuating pathogenicity but with concern for increased rates of mutation and resistance  <cit> . we confirmed that  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide caused strong growth inhibition but not cell death for the first  <dig> min post-treatment .

to determine genome-wide transcriptional changes in response to hydrogen peroxide, we conducted four and five independent microarray experiments in the absence  and the presence  of hydrogen peroxide, respectively. transcriptome analysis with affymetrix p. aeruginosa genechip arrays suggested that mrna levels of  <dig> and  <dig> out of a total of  <dig>  genes were increased and decreased , respectively, after  <dig> min treatment. we refer to "statistically marked" changes in transcript level for those genes that meet the following criteria:  a p-value for a mann-whitney test should be less than  <dig> ,  an absolute fold change in transcript level should be equal to or greater than  <dig>  and  a gene should have a presence or marginal call  <cit>  from 50% or more replicates on both the experimental and control replicate sets. based on these criteria, we pared the set to  <dig> and  <dig> genes  that had statistically marked increases and decreases in transcript level, respectively. this result suggests that these genes might be associated with the defensive response of p. aeruginosa to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. interestingly, this number is comparable to that found in a study of e. coli cells treated with  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide   <cit> , and significantly less than those of a comparable p. aeruginosa study   <cit> . in table  <dig>  from among the  <dig> genes, we list  <dig> most strongly induced and repressed genes as well as their putative functions, many of which are discussed below. additionally, supplementary table  <dig> shows the average signals, p-values, and fold changes of all  <dig>  predicted p. aeruginosa open reading frames. the data discussed in this publication have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> 

to validate the relative transcript levels obtained by the array analysis, we employed quantitative real-time pcr analysis on pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , and pa <dig>  these genes were selected since they displayed a range of mrna level changes . moreover, pa <dig>  was used as a control gene for the relative mrna level calculation due to the fact that rpod exhibits stable expression level  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  our microarray results were corroborated with quantitative real-time pcr analyses of the selected genes.

functional classification
to examine how the genes are distributed with regard to their functions, we classified these  <dig> genes according to the categories described in the pseudomonas aeruginosa community annotation project  <cit>  . both figure  <dig> and table  <dig> indicate that the most distinctive feature was the completely uniform upregulation of genes involved in dna modulation ; this is discussed further below. it also appeared that genes related to various membrane functions including "transport of small molecules", "secreted factors", and "membrane proteins" were noticeably downregulated, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide alters the regulation of membrane proteins. even among the  <dig> most downregulated genes presented in table  <dig>   <dig> genes belonged to these functional classes , pa <dig>  pa <dig> , pa <dig>  pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig>  pa <dig> , pa <dig>  pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig>  pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , and pa4218). this result may reflect attenuation of active and/or facilitated transport through the cell membrane. notably, many genes associated with these classes were found linked with iron regulation . also, consistent with the sublethal but significant applied stress, as shown in table  <dig>  several genes involved in primary metabolism exhibited decreased mrna levels:  energy metabolism-related genes, pa <dig> , pa <dig> , and pa <dig> , and pa <dig>   polyamine synthesis and uptake genes , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , and pa3607- <dig> , and  ribosomal protein genes, pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , and pa <dig> . it is also interesting that putative cell division inhibitors such as pa <dig> and pa <dig>  which are similar to e. coli sula  <cit> , showed increased transcript levels upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that these genes might promote the repression of primary metabolism.

athe fold change is a positive number when the expression level in the experiment increased compared to the control and is a negative number when the expression level in the experiment declined.

b the p value is higher than  <dig> .

c the fold change is less than  <dig> 

genes related to cellular protective mechanisms
second, dna repair-related genes were highly induced in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. indeed, it is known that hydrogen peroxide causes oxidative dna damage by generating hydroxyl or ferryl radicals  <cit> . palma et al. demonstrated that genes of p. aeruginosa sos regulon exhibit increases in mrna level upon exposure to  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . reportedly, reca stimulates autodigestion of repressor protein lexa for the activation of the sos regulon in e. coli  <cit> . our study also revealed increased expression of pa <dig>  and pa <dig>  . furthermore, pa <dig>  adjacent to lexa, showed high increase in transcript level; notably, this gene is similar to e. coli sula, which inhibits cell division until dna repair is finished  <cit> . besides, pa <dig> , a downstream gene of reca, is reportedly involved in regulation of reca expression  <cit> . other interesting genes possibly relevant to dna repair-related functions included pa <dig> , pa3413-pa <dig>  and pa <dig> . to be specific, a protein encoded by pa <dig> exhibited a high homology to ybeg in e. coli, which is inducible by dna damage  <cit> . moreover, the fact that dnae, similar to a product encoded by pa <dig>  is involved in dna mismatch correction or dna repair in bacillus subtilis suggests that the pa <dig> protein might also participate in repairing dna damage caused by hydrogen peroxide in our study  <cit> .

as shown in figure  <dig>  the complete profile of our response is compared directly to that of palma et al.  <cit> . our results were generally consistent and, overall, this portion of our analysis corroborates previous studies that have associated oxidative stress response genes with hydrogen peroxide and other ros insults, and reinforces the conclusion that dna repair proteins and catalases may be among the most central mechanisms that p. aeruginosa employs to counteract lethal effects of reactive oxygen intermediates.

genes related to iron regulation
as mentioned above, however, one of the aims of this study was to examine the responses of ros stress genes to the rest of cellular metabolism, in order to provide new insight on p. aeruginosa regulation in response to varied oxygen conditions as is expected in niche environments of the human lung. among the more interesting findings was an apparent discrepancy between previous reports of iron-regulated genes. these genes are highlighted in figure  <dig>  iron metabolism is important for many reasons: there are many iron catalyzed oxygen reactions that can damage cells; there are many sources of iron, particularly localized in the human lung; and iron-related genes are often coordinately regulated with oxidative stress defenses in e. coli  <cit> . notably, this study also revealed that hydrogen peroxide treatment drastically altered iron regulation in p. aeruginosa. in particular, the following genes, all of which are known to be regulated by the ferric uptake regulator , were repressed in response to hydrogen peroxide :  iron starvation sigma factor, pa <dig> ,  ferri-siderophore  receptor genes, pa <dig>  and pa <dig> ,  siderophore  biosynthesis genes, pa4225-pa <dig>  and pa4228-pa <dig> , and  siderophore  system-related genes, papa2403-pa <dig> and pa <dig>  <cit> .

as is widely accepted, in order to overcome a limited supply of iron, p. aeruginosa produces two major siderophores, pyoverdin and pyochelin  <cit>  and upon iron deprivation, these siderophores are excreted from the cells, chelate iron and transport it back to the cells through outer membrane receptors, fpta and fpva, which are specific for the iron-siderophore complexes  <cit> . moreover, in the absence of iron, pchr, encoded by pa <dig>  seems to become a repressor of the receptor gene, fpta, and of its own gene, pchr. on the other hand, excess iron represses the biosynthesis of pyoverdin and pyochelin  <cit> ; that is, in the presence of abundant iron, the fur protein, a repressor, binds to the promoters of genes encoding pvds and pchr proteins, which positively regulate the biosynthesis of pyoverdin and pyochelin, respectively  <cit> . these phenomena seem congruent with the transcript levels of iron-related genes in this study.

it has been documented that the intracellular iron level could be affected by oxidative stress  <cit> . in particular, superoxide, generated during the reduction process of oxygen, releases free iron from iron-sulfur proteins, thus increasing the levels of intracellular iron  <cit> . consequently, the result that the iron regulation-related genes such as pvds, fpva, fpta, and pchabcdef were repressed in our study could be accounted for by prior reports suggesting that the amount of intracellular iron might be increased as a result of exposure to reactive oxidants  <cit> . at this point, it should be pointed out that "free iron" was intended to suggest not that the iron is hexa-aqueous, but that the iron is not integrated into enzymes. iron vigorously binds to most biomolecules so that iron atoms free inside the cell likely exist in a form associated with the surfaces of cellular molecules. as shown in figure  <dig>  palma et al. previously reported induction of several iron starvation-inducible genes such as pa <dig>  pa <dig>  pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> , and pa <dig>  upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that cells experience iron starvation and/or a transient loss of fur repressor function  <cit> . the reason for this discrepancy is not understood at present; however, it should not be excluded that different growth mediums, exposure times, and/or growth phase  as well as a different p. aeruginosa isolates were used in the two studies .

lastly, it should be pointed out that iron regulation system might be an attractive therapeutic target because it appears to be closely related to the antioxidant mechanism of p. aeruginosa. for instance, siderophore malfunction by potent drugs could lead to inhibition and/or imbalance of iron regulation and thus, could increase the cell's susceptibility to exogenous oxidative stress that phagocytes utilize during active infection.

genes related to pyocin system
the most striking result of our study, which has not been shown previously in any oxygen-insult studies of any bacterium, was that f-, r- and s- type pyocins, bacteriocins of p. aeruginosa, were strongly induced in response to hydrogen peroxide. as shown in figure  <dig>  these  <dig> genes were uniformly upregulated. many strains are known to adapt bacteriocins so as to preserve the initial predominance of bacteriocinogenic bacteria  <cit> ; however, bacteriocins are effective only against the same or closely related species  <cit> . surprisingly, our study revealed that pa <dig> , pa <dig> , and pa <dig>  were induced upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide . further, as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  all the genes of a r2/f <dig> pyocin gene locus  exhibited increased mrna levels . thus, r <dig> pyocin , f <dig> pyocin , and lysis enzymes  were likely expressed with the hydrogen peroxide treatment . pyocins cause cell death by dna breakdown and the inhibition of lipid synthesis; their production is inducible by mutagenic agents such as uv and mitomycin c  <cit> . reca , prtr  and prtn  co-regulate activity of many pyocin genes. as noted above, dna-damaging agents increase production of reca, which in turn, cleaves prtr and releases prtn  <cit> . hence, since dna repair-related genes including reca were upregulated in our study and regulatory genes such as reca, prtn, and prtr are probably shared by s-, f-, and r-type pyocins  <cit> , we may conclude that dna damage might also be a reason for the induction of these pyocins, s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  r <dig>  and f <dig>  moreover, the induction of lysis enzymes , which are likely shared by s-, f-, and r-type pyocins, indicates that these pyocins might have been released from the cells  <cit> .

these results suggest that host cells are exposed to pyocins that are induced by oxidative stress during active infection. as indicated above, pyocins are known to kill species closely related to p. aeruginosa . interestingly, pyocins display cytotoxic effects on human cancer cells, triggering lethal events  <cit> . at present, it is unclear whether pyocins are causative toxic agents in patients with defective immune systems; however, it should not be excluded that pyocin production might be another defense mechanism that p. aeruginosa employs against oxidative attack by host cells.

another notable finding was that pa <dig>  encoding the pyocin s <dig> immunity protein exhibited a significant decrease in transcript level . that is, secreted bacteriocins pose a survival problem to host bacteria, so cells produce immunity enzymes, high affinity inhibitors of bacteriocins, during bacteriocin synthesis  <cit> . p. aeruginosa possesses several pyocin immunity proteins that provide a self-protection function against s-type pyocins  <cit> , by binding to the pyocin nuclease domain and neutralizing its activity  <cit> . thus, our result that the pyocin s <dig> immunity protein was repressed during pyocin production could render p. aeruginosa vulnerable to this bacteriocin, which might even lead to its own death during pyocin synthesis.

coincident with this, it was earlier observed that strains of p. aeruginosa produce pyocins active against themselves  <cit> . the conditions leading to their production were not investigated. the potential for programmed cell death in this system is an intriguing speculation. it may be that self-killing activity by part of a p. aeruginosa population benefits the remainder. for example, microbial population may dissipate damaging effects of extracellular stress such as ph change and oxidative stress by lysing some of the cells, which might be particularly effective for p. aeruginosa biofilms where layers of cells exist. besides, given that dna damage might elicit pyocin production, cells with damaged dna may be the most appropriate targets for cell death, enabling preservation of the remainder of the population.

these kinds of activities apparently require cell-to-cell communication; therefore, it is interesting to question whether the quorum sensing system might be involved in pyocin synthesis. based on quorum sensing-regulated genes that have been previously reported , we found that  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, also showed transcription level changes in response to hydrogen peroxide in our study. while coincident up- or down-regulation does not establish a connection between quorum sensing and pyocin systems, this result might indicate that some genes involved in the quorum sensing system were also activated during cellular response to oxidants. in this light, it is noteworthy that degradation of secreted peptide staphylococcus aureus autoinducers has been linked to the antioxidant response  <cit> .

the last and perhaps most interesting result is that s-type pyocins become more lethal under iron-limited conditions because they presumably enter cells through siderophore receptors  <cit> ; thus, the repression of siderophore receptors in our study  may increase the possibility that the activation of s-type pyocins had larger impact on producer cells. however, in contrast, it might also be possible that the induction of pyocin production might contribute to the repression of iron uptake-related genes of the other population. further investigation is required to verify the role of the immunity protein repression and the relationship between pyocins and iron-uptake genes.

co-transcription of genes in operons
in our attempt to further evaluate the transcription levels of genes discussed above, we investigated the co-transcription of their operons. that is, since genes within operons are largely co-regulated, we expected a considerable correlation between these genes and their neighboring genes within the same operon. to test this, we first selected  <dig> putative operons of the genes described in this report using the "predicting operons in microbial genome" resource of the institute for genomic research . we then calculated the pearson's correlation coefficient  from the transcript levels of  <dig> pairs of neighboring genes in these  <dig> operons. for baseline comparison, we also analyzed  <dig> pairs of randomly selected neighboring genes across the genome. note that each pair has nine  array datasets. in table  <dig>  we observed that the neighboring genes sharing the same operon exhibited significantly high co-transcription levels  in this study. this result also provides a high degree of confidence in the transcriptome data we presented herein.

aeach gene pair has nine microarray datasets.

comparison of microarray data to other data in the literature
lastly, in order to provide another assessment on our results, we compared our genes with statistically marked transcript level changes with those published in palma et al.  <cit> . as indicated above, our study examined the transcriptional response upon  <dig> min exposure to  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide in luria-bertani broth, whereas palma et al.  <cit>  utilized  <dig> min exposure time in tryptic soy broth. since the mann-whitney test with the cutoff p and fold change values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, was applied to both studies, we performed a comparative analysis between the two transcriptome profiles. supplementary table  <dig> shows that of  <dig> genes that we previously considered statistically marked in our report,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in both studies. further,  <dig> genes induced in this report were repressed in palma et al.  <cit> , while  <dig> genes displayed the opposite expression pattern. in supplementary table  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes that were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in this study were not among genes with statistically significant mrna level changes in palma's report. interestingly, the fold changes were generally lower under our experimental conditions. this result demonstrates that about 40% of our statistically marked genes were regulated in the same direction in palma et al.  <cit> .

next, we focused on genes that we earlier discussed in this report, which were originally listed in table  <dig>  supplementary table  <dig> shows that most genes in the categories of "primary metabolism-related" and "cellular protective mechanism-related" were concurrently regulated in the two reports. to be particular, genes encoding enzymes that play integral roles in oxidative response, such as catalases and dna repair proteins, were consistently upregulated. this result reinforces our prior conclusion that the early transcriptional responses of p. aeruginosa to hydrogen peroxide include the repression of primary metabolism and the induction of protective mechanisms. on the other hand, most genes related to iron regulation and pyocin system were discordantly regulated in the two studies . as previously discussed, while we cannot fully elucidate this disagreement, we should not exclude the possibility that different growth mediums, strain backgrounds, and exposure times account for the divergent microarray data. indeed, several reports are in line with this speculation:  vasil proposed that dissimilar experimental conditions including strain history and growth mediums bring about discrepancies in the quorum-sensing transcriptional profiles  <cit> ,  spiegeleer et al. demonstrated that oxidative stress resistance of e. coli is dependent on the growth medium  <cit> ,  kang et al. suggested that strain background is one of the factors affecting a microarray-based transcriptome analysis  <cit> , and  our laboratory observed a large difference in the transcriptional profiles of staphylococcus aureus response to oxidative stress between  <dig> min and  <dig> min exposures . therefore, this result suggests that further investigation on iron regulation and pyocin system in p. aeruginosa under oxidative stress requires careful evaluation of transcriptional effects by experimental variances.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrated how oxidative stress-induced genes were related and regulated in p. aeruginosa by utilizing whole-genome microarrays. our results suggest that dna repair proteins and catalases be among the most vital antioxidant defense systems of p. aeruginosa for preventing lethal effects of reactive oxygen intermediates. second, a slowdown of membrane function-related genes was observed, implying that sublethal oxidative damage reduced active and/or facilitated transport through the cell membrane. third, it was confirmed that oxidative stress could affect iron metabolism in that many of fur-regulated genes were repressed upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide. in addition, this finding, together with other reports  <cit>  suggests that intracellular iron level might be a key factor for the relationship. most importantly, we provided evidence that reactive oxidant treatment results in the induction of all three types of pyocin genes in p. aeruginosa. furthermore, it was demonstrated that a pyocin immunity protein was repressed, which if coincident events occur might lead to self-killing activity. to our knowledge, this is the first study reporting pyocin upregulation in response to oxidative stress. hence, we are currently exploring whether the repression of an immunity protein increases the sensitivity of p. aeruginosa to pyocins and pyocin production benefits its population against toxic oxidants.
