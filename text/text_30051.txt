BACKGROUND
in the field of neurosurgery, disorders of the hypothalamic/posterior pituitary usually occur in humans after surgery of the hypothalamus and its proximal region. abnormal water and electrolyte metabolism are typical postoperative complications. injury to magnocellular vasopressin  and oxytocin  neurons induces marked changes in the morphology and function of the neurohypophysis. axotomy leads to neuronal retrograde degeneration in the peripheral and central nervous system  <cit> . in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system , various types of axonal injury in vivo, including pituitary stalk compression <cit> , hypophysectomy <cit> , neurohypophy-sectomy  <cit>  and pituitary stalk transection  <cit> , result in degeneration of the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus and the development of diabetes insipidus. in addition, disruption of the axons of the hns also leads to retrograde degeneration of substantial numbers of magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic  and paraventricular  nuclei of the hypothalamus and leads to 74%–90% loss of the magnocellular neurons  in the paraventricular . however, these studies only reported abnormal metabolism and degeneration of mcns after axotomy but the time course and correlations between metabolism and histology of the degeneration of mcn are not clear which will facilitate us to find the therapeutic window.

cell death is usually classified as apoptosis and necrosis which are differentiated on the basis of morphological abnormalities of cells at the ultrastructural level, patterns of dna fragmentation on agarose gel electrophoresis. apoptosis is characterized by membrane blabbing, perinuclear chromatin condensation, organelle swelling and by endonuclease-mediated internucleosomal dna fragmentation into a "ladder" pattern. necrosis is characterized by diffuse organelle swelling and lysis as well as random dna fragmentation resulting in "smearing" of dna on agarose gels  <cit> . caspase- <dig> is considered the central apoptotic effector enzyme responsible for many of the biochemical and morphological features of apoptosis <cit> . activation of caspase- <dig> represents an irreversible step in the cell death pathway and cells containing activated caspase- <dig> are prone to die <cit> . it has been reported that in organotypic cultures of the hns, extensive cell death of mcns die by apoptosis after the massive axotomy  <cit> . the neurotrophic factors, cntf and lif, and the neural activity can significantly reverse the cell death of the mcns in vitro  <cit> .

there are many studies to date have ascertained possible mechanism about the degeneration resulting from the axonal damage of cns neurons. it has been reported that the cell death of mcns in organotypic cultures in vitro is due to apoptosis. but the histopathological change and the type of death of mcns are not clear after axotomy of hns in vivo. this present study was aimed to investigate the time course and correlation between abnormal water and electrolyte metabolism and degeneration of mcns as well as the mechanism of cells death of mcns after hypophysectomy. daily water consumption, daily urine volume, specific gravity of urine and plasma avp concentration were measured; avp-immunopositive neurons were counted at  <dig> d,  <dig> d,  <dig> d and  <dig> d after hypophysectomy and apoptosis were analyzed.

RESULTS
clinical findings
all rats in hypophysectomy group started drinking water after recovery of anesthesia and started eating food from the next day. no marked neurological abnormalities or respiratory symptoms appeared in any of the animals throughout the follow-up period and their activity and appetite were constant and normal.

changes of dwc, duv and usg
the average daily water consumption , daily urine volume  and specific gravity of urine  of control group were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ml/ <dig> h,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ml/ <dig> h and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively, which remained relatively constant throughout the entire period of observation. hypophysectomy rats exhibited a triphasic pattern of dwc, duv and usg: a sharply increased dwc  and duv  during the first  <dig> days after surgery , followed by low level dwc  and duv  at 4– <dig> d which were comparable with those observed in control group . after phase  <dig>  dwc  and duv  increased again and remained at an elevated level in the following days . the changes of usg also exhibited a triphasic pattern . 

change of plasma avp concentration
plasma avp concentrations were relatively constant at various times in control group . plasma avp concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml at  <dig> d after surgery in hypophysectomy rats. the difference between two groups was statistically significant . at  <dig> d after surgery, it was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg/ml in hypophysectomy group, which increased significantly compared with those at  <dig> d. in the follow-up period, plasma avp concentration decreased again. 

avp-positive cell counts
immunofluorescence using anti-avp antibody was performed in the hypothalamic region and avp-positive cells were counted in the supraoptic nuclei. in hypophysectomy group, the avp-positive cell numbers in supraoptic nuclei of both sides were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cells at  <dig> d,  <dig> d,  <dig> d and  <dig> d respectively after surgery . compared with the control group, there were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of survival avp neurons in these nuclei at each time point respectively in hypophysectomy group. the number of avp-positive neurons decreased progressively from the  <dig> d, and reached minimum at  <dig> d and  <dig> d . 

immunostaining of the active form of caspase- <dig> and colocalized with avp
cleaved caspase- <dig> is the activated form of caspase- <dig>  a critical effecter of apoptosis  <cit> . immunofluorescence analysis using the specific antibody against cleaved caspase- <dig> was performed at  <dig> d after surgery. there were very few caspase- <dig> immunopositive neurons in control group. marked increased caspase- <dig> expression was present in supraoptic nuclei of hypophysectomy rats. there were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  caspase- <dig> immunopositive cells  at  <dig> d after hypophysectomy. the double immunostaining of avp/caspase- <dig> showed that most of caspase- <dig> immunopositive cells were clearly visible colocalized with avp-immunopositive neurons  and a few caspase- <dig> immunopositive cells was not colocalized with avp-immunopositive neurons , which might be ot neurons. 

patterns of dna fragmentation
dna from the tissues of hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus was isolated and agarose gel electrophoresis was performed. this method allowed the distinction between apoptotic "laddering" of dna into internucleosomal fragments and necrotic "smearing" of dna into random-size fragments. agarose gel electrophoresis of dna purified from hypophysectomy group at  <dig> d after surgery showed oligonucleosomal bands in a "ladder" pattern of migration, whereas samples from the control animals did not yield it .

ultrastructural observations
ultrastructural analysis of the hypophysectomy group revealed numerous neurons undergoing apoptotic degeneration. the neurons of hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus showed several apoptotic features such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation, cell surface protrusions .

discussion
in mammals, the majority of vasopressin producing magnocellular neurons and oxytocin cells distribute in the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei  <cit> . these cells send long axonal projections toward the fenestrated capillaries of the neurohypophysis where they release their hormonal content into the blood stream to reach peripheral target organs. circulating vasopressin, the antidiuretic hormone, maintains extracellular fluid balance by regulating water resorptions from the distal tubulus of the kidney and is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors yet identified  <cit> . deficient secretion of vasopressin results in the syndrome of diabetes insipidus which is characterized by polydypsia and polyuria. diabetes insipidus was one of the major complications of hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal stract damage and cerebral neurosurgery which manifested as abnormalities of electrolyte metabolism, such as central hypernatremia or central hyponatremia  <cit> . hypophysectomy is a conventional animal model in the study of dibetes insipidus. following neurohypophysectomy, rats exhibit a pronounced diabetes insipidus and dramatically decreased urinary levels of avp  <cit> . dohancics et al. reported that stalk-compressed rats exhibited a triphasic pattern of water intake <cit> . as these previous reports, the present study exhibited a triphasic pattern of daily water consumption, daily urine volume and specific gravity of urine of hypophysectomy rats: an increased water intake and urine volume during the first  <dig> days after surgery , followed by a comparable of dwc and duv with those observed in sham-operated rats 4– <dig> d , after which dwc and duv increased again and remained at an elevated level throughout the rest of time . the changes of usg also exhibited a triphasic pattern. diabetes insipidus is a kind of pathologic state resulting from decreased ability of the kidney to concentrate urine because of the decreased secretion of avp from the posterior pituitary gland or resistance to the action of avp. avp is mainly secreted by large neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. it descends along the nerve axon and is stored in the posterior pituitary gland through the inner layer of the median eminence. total resection of the pituitary gland results in loss of storage and secretion capability for avp in the posterior pituitary in animal. to confirm the correlation between the diabetes insipidus and plasma avp concentration, plasma avp concentration also was measured at <dig> d,  <dig> d,  <dig> d,  <dig> dand  <dig> d after surgery. in the present study, plasma avp concentration was significant lower in hypophysectomy  than that in the control group  at the  <dig> d. at the  <dig> d after surgery, plasma avp concentration was higher than that at the  <dig> d, but was still lower than that in the control. in the following time, plasma avp concentration decreased again at  <dig> d,  <dig> d and  <dig> d after hypophysectomy. plasma avp concentration also exhibited a triphasic pattern in accord with the pattern of diabetes insipidus. many previous studies reported that the plasma avp concentration decreased after axotomy and an ectopic neurosecretory gland-like structure above the pituitary was found as well as an ectopic miniature neurohypophysis at the distal end of the pituitary stalk formed after hypophysectomy, neurohypophysectomy, stalk section or mechanical stalk compression. in this present study plasma avp concentration decreased at  <dig> d after hypophysetomy was due to loss of storage and secretion capability for avp in the posterior pituitary. the plasma avp concentration relatively increased at  <dig> d probably because of the release of the avp stored in the magnocellular neurons through the ectopic miniature neurohypophysis while the decreased concentration of avp in the following time points resulted from the degeneration of magnocellular neurons of hypothalamus.

retrograde degeneration of magnocellular neurons is well known to occur after hypophysectomy <cit> , neurolobectomy  <cit>  and stalk damage <cit> . although magnocellular degeneration after axonal damage has also been demonstrated quantitatively <cit> , these studies did not evaluate the time correlation between the degeneration of avp neurons and the occurrence of diabetes insipidus. immunofluorescence analysis revealed that avp-positive cells tended to decrease after hypophysectomy, suggesting that excision of the posterior lobe resulted in the decrease of magnocellular neurons in the hypothalamus. dohanics et al., used a different stereotaxic method to compression the stalk, which resulted in marked diabetes insipidus accompanied by the significant degeneration of the avp neuron population in both son and the pvn, resulting in the survival of only ~35% and ~27% of avp neurons in these nuclei at  <dig> days after surgery, respectively <cit> . this finding was similar to herman's study  <cit> , in which a marked loss of magnocellular avp-containing neurons was induced after neurohypophysectomy in conjunction with chronic vasopressin agonist treatment. the present study demonstrated the survivals of  <dig> % and  <dig> % avp neurons at the  <dig> d and  <dig> d after hypophysectomy, respectively , and the survivals of avp neurons were  <dig> % at the  <dig> d  and  <dig> % at the  <dig> d . these findings showed that the degeneration occurred from the  <dig> d after hypophysetomy, aggravated at the  <dig> d and then stabilized. this study showed that the avp neurons did not begin to degenerate at the  <dig> d but diabetes insipidus occurred and plasma avp concentration decreased, which was probably because the loss of avp storage and secretion capability by resection of the posterior pituitary and an ectopic neural lobe had not been formed. an ectopic neural lobe formed after axotomy would enhance secretion of avp into the portal circulation. at the  <dig> d after surgery avp stored in the magnocellular neurons in the hypothalamus nuclei was released by the ectopic neural lobe and the plasma avp concentration increased. from  <dig> d plasma avp concentration decreased and diabetes insipidus occurred again because of the significant degeneration of avp neurons. in one word, there was tight time correlation between the occurrence of diabetes insipidus, plasma avp concentration and the degeneration of avp neurons after hypophysectomy.

cell death is usually classified as apoptotic or necrotic based on biochemical and morphologic criteria  <cit> . apoptosis and necrosis can be distinguished histologically <cit> . tissue necrosis is typified by loss of membrane integrity, morphological signs of organelle damage, nuclear flocculation, loss of lysosomal contents, cellular swelling and uncontrolled cell lysis  <cit> . apoptosis is characterized by preservation of membrane integrity, cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation, diminution of cellular volume, plasma membrane bleb formation and morphological preservation of organellar structure. the cell eventually fragments into apoptotic bodies that are engulfed by neighboring cells and degraded  <cit> . during apoptosis, morphological changes often are accompanied by internucleosomal cleavage of genomic dna  <cit> . in contrast to necrosis, apoptosis does not result in loss of cellular content and does not initiate an inflammatory response. many lines of evidence in the previous studies indicate that the central neurons commit themselves to apoptotic death after axotomy. at the ultrastructural level the morphological features of these cells are associated classically with apoptotic death  <cit> . the selective degeneration of vasopressin neurosecretory neurons has been reported in cases of human diabetes insipidus <cit>  and in animal models after axotomy <cit> . in the vitro studies, selective death of these neurons were also demonstrated in organotypic cultures of the hypothalmic nucleus and the nature of the death is apoptosis which could be specifically prevented by the administration of the cytokines cntf <cit> . it was found that the massive degeneration of vasopressin-positive neurons by apoptotic cell death was specific for the vasopressin magnocellular population. this present study was aimed to determine whether the degeneration of vasopressin neurons in supraoptic nuclei after hypophysectomy was due to apoptosis in vivo. the ultrastrctural changes of magnocellular neurons were observed at  <dig> d after hypophysectomy under electron microscope. cytoplasmic condensation and blebbing, compaction and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin and the eventual dissolution of membranous barriers between organelles and cytoplasm were found. fragmentation patterns of dna isolated from hypothalamic supraoptic nuclei tissues using agarose gel electrophoresis was analyzed. this method allows the distinction between apoptotic "laddering" of dna into internucleosomal fragments and necrotic "smearing" of dna into random-size fragments <cit> . dna laddering is a common early step to all types of cell death. the initial event in cell death appears to be the activation of endonuclease that generates a ladder of dna fragments of high molecular weight. in apoptosis, this degradation goes uninterrupted until most of the dna is fragmented into mononucleosomes, which are dna fragments protected from further endonuclease digestion by intact histone octamers. in contrast, release of proteases from disrupted lysosomes follows at some time after endonuclease activation in necrosis leading to degradation of the protective histones and full exposure of the dna to the endonuclease. this exposure results in random dna degradation seen as a "smear" on agarose gel electrophoresis. in the present study, the typical dna laddering was detected with agarose gel electrophoresis. it has been showed that the activation of caspase- <dig>  followed by cleavage of specific substrates, may contribute to the process of apoptosis by structural changes or by affecting certain signaling molecules. cleaved caspase- <dig> is an important regulator of apoptosis and its proteolytically cleaved form is known to be upregulated in neurons undergoing apoptosis  <cit> . in our study, immunofluorescence analysis using the specific antibody against cleaved caspase- <dig> revealed that there was very low level of caspase- <dig> immunoreactivity in supraoptic neurons in control while caspase- <dig> was found progressively upregulated in hypophysectomy rats. to confirm the cell type of apoptotic neurons, vasopressin/caspase- <dig> double staining was performed. it was found that most caspase- <dig> immunopositive cells were colocalized with vasopressin. this present study suggested that the degeneration of vasopressin neurons was due to apoptosis in hypophysectomy rats.

CONCLUSIONS
this study firstly demonstrated that apoptosis was involved in degeneration of vasopressin neurons in hypothalamic supraoptic nuclei after hypophysectomy in vivo and development of centrarl diabetes insipidus. these data suggested that anti-apoptosis would ameliorate the degeneration and protect these neurons after hypophysectomy. it has been reported that cntf, bcl-xl and caspase inhibitor could increase the survival of rat vasopressin magnocellular neurons in organotypic cluture. it will be worth further exploring whether such trophic factors and apoptosis inhibitor would protect these neurons in vivo. moreover our study on time course and correlations among metabolism, degeneration and apoptosis of mcn suggested an efficient therapeutic window in which irreversible diabetes insipidus might be prevented by antiapoptosis.
