BACKGROUND
the isolation and gene expression profiling of embryonic circulating nrbcs would be of great interest to developmental biologists and clinicians alike  <cit> , yet due to limited sample size available from traditionally used model organisms, harvesting a sufficiently large pool of embryonic nrbcs for transcriptome-wide analysis has been difficult. alternative approaches using perinatal blood have already yielded significant insights  <cit> . the chick embryo is both large in size and contains a circulatory network of a complexity equal to that of mammals. herein, we describe the isolation and gene expression profiling of circulating cells during the transition phase of hematopoiesis from primitive or yolk sac associated, to definitive hematopoiesis, at embryonic days  <dig> and  <dig>  it is during this time that hematopoiesis occurs transiently in the peri-aortic region in the chick embryo , before transitioning to the bone marrow  <cit> .

RESULTS
chick blood was isolated from embryos at e <dig> and e <dig>  using micro-capillaries inserted directly into the heart. density gradient centrifugation was then employed to isolate the heavier rbcs from a lighter nrbc population from total embryonic blood. cells within the two populations were analyzed directly by facs, and by the classical hematological stains giemsa, benzidine, and periodic-acid schiff . using these techniques, we were able to confirm that two distinct, viable populations; one highly enriched in rbcs, and another population highly depleted of rbcs  had been isolated .

further characterization of these populations by rt-pcr demonstrated that nrbcs had high expression levels of the hematopoietic stem cell antigen cd <dig>  whereas the rbc population lacked expression of this gene . after these preliminary findings had given validity to our technique, gene expression profiling was performed using affymetrix gene expression arrays. for rna isolation, handling time was kept to a minimum and cell collection to lysis for rna extraction was performed in less than one hour. consequently, cells were not subjected to long incubation periods on ice, or in serum containing medium, which can alter gene expression, as is the case for other commonly used in techniques such as facs sorting. rna from both e <dig> and e <dig> rbc and nrbc samples were analyzed by duplicate affymetrix gene chips, from separate, pooled biological samples . comparisons between rbc and nrbc populations were made, and the expression levels of candidate genes were confirmed by pcr . the resulting array data has been deposited into ncbi gene expression omnibus  under the accession number gse <dig>  we considered genes to be significantly enriched in the nrbc population by the following two criteria: 1) that they are expressed at higher levels in the nrbc than the rbc population by the sam algorithm; 2) that they are not expressed at high levels in the heart .

hematopoietic stem cell  associated genes are upregulated in nrbcs
many genes known to be associated with hscs were found to be preferentially expressed in nrbcs, such as the hsc membrane receptor glycoprotein  cd <dig>   <cit> . moreover, transcription factors ets- <dig>  <cit> , hex  <cit> , klf <dig>  <cit>  and pu. <dig>  <cit> , known to be essential for primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, were detected specifically in the nrbc population; as were the signaling molecules blnk  <cit> , fyn  <cit> , rgs <dig>  <cit> , rac <dig>  <cit> , lyn and syk  <cit> , vav <dig>  <cit>  and the ion channel slo <dig>  <cit> . additionally, the expression of many integrins, which are known to play an important role in the adhesion and homing of hscs, were detected in nrbcs. a significant overlapping integrin repertoire was observed between nrbcs and a previous study on adipose derived stromal cd31+ hscs and includes: cd <dig> , cd49b , cd49f , cd <dig> , cd <dig> , and the non-integrin cell adhesion molecule cd <dig>   <cit> . in addition to integrins, previous work has established an important role for gps  in the adhesion and possibly homing of hscs, and has demonstrated the expression of the gp receptor cd62l, and the gp cystatin- <dig> on hscs  <cit> . finally, cell-cell communication required during later differentiation of hscs in the stroma is known to be mediated by the gap junctional protein connexin  <dig> , another gene detected in the nrbc population  <cit> .

myeloid markers expressed by nrbcs
in addition to the expression of gps on hscs, expression of the platelet gp ligand cd62p , important for hsc adherence  <cit> , and the myeloid gps cd200r  <cit>  and cd <dig>  <cit>  were detected in the nrbc population. other markers of the undifferentiated myeloid lineage including gelsolin  <cit>  and pu. <dig> were both detected in nrbc fraction. furthermore, many genes detected in nrbcs can be associated with platelet activation pathways such as, coagulation factors x and xiii, cox- <dig>  pai, pdgf, plcg <dig>  tissue factor pathway inhibitor, thrombin receptor, and vav <dig>  <cit> .

lymphoid markers expressed by nrbcs
our expression profiling of nrbcs reveals not only the known potential of early circulating embryonic cells towards myeloid and erythroid lineages, but also that of the lymphoid lineage. the expression of leukocyte specific genes which are part of the innate immune system such as the lymphocyte antigens ly <dig>  and ly <dig> , toll-like receptor  <dig>   <cit>  as well as interleukin  <dig> receptor   <cit> , β-defensin  <cit> , members of the tnf signaling pathway, tnfsf13b  and tnfsfr <dig> , which can mediate the innate immune response  <cit> , and lect <dig>  which is involved in neutrophil chemotaxis  <cit> , demonstrate that a lymphoid differentiation potential is already present at the peri-aortic stage, a finding which has been reported previously for similarly staged agm derived cells in mice  <cit> . the only gene expressed in nrbcs which has a role in acquired immunity appears to be the src-like adaptor molecule, slap, whose function is to repress surface igm expression on b-cells  <cit> . interestingly, the heme oxygenase- <dig>  an essential enzyme in heme catabolism, was the only true erythroid associated gene detected in the nrbcs. however, the expression of hmox <dig> has been reported in a variety of primitive and definitive white blood cell types as well, although it does not appear to be essential for their development  <cit> .

germ cell, neural, and cardiac markers expressed by nrbcs
additional categories of genes that were observed in nrbcs include: fragilis and zov <dig>   <cit> , and pleiotrophin  and thrombospondin- <dig>    <cit> . moreover, despite being negatively screened against genes upregulated in the heart , elfin, and pinch- <dig>  which mark early cardiac cells  <cit> , were detected in circulating nrbcs.

additional genes expressed by nrbcs
finally, a list of genes with unknown functions has emerged from this screen. although the interleukin- <dig> receptor associated protein  and tnf-alpha interacting protein  <dig>  are likely to be involved in the innate immune response, the other  <dig> genes remain developmentally uncharacterized, and may provide insight into the function and differentiation of hscs . interestingly, the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase gene , which was expressed in nrbcs, may help to protect progenitor cells against oxidative stress  <cit> , although conclusive proof to this end remains to be demonstrated.

further expression validation: ish, ihc and facs
following our expression profiling at the in vitro level, we next verified our expression data for certain interesting candidate nrbc expressed genes, for which qpcr had been performed, by wholemount is situ hybridization  and immunostaining  of the yolk sac. at e <dig> and e <dig>  the time points analyzed, the yolk sac is highly vascularized and provides a receptacle for circulating cells transiting to and from the embryonic and extraembryonic regions. reproducible labeling of rare positive circulating cells was observed for cd <dig>  cd200r, and hex, whereas infrequent clusters of positive cells were found to express rgs <dig> by ish . furthermore, hex expression was observed in large numbers of mesenchymal cells neighboring blood vessels either containing, or devoid of hex positive circulating cells. cd200r occasionally labeled cells with an endothelial morphology. ihc for the cd51/cd <dig> heterodimer or vitronectin receptor  revealed expression in rare circulating small rounded cells which were either clumped and associated with the endothelium, or singular. facs analysis using this antibody demonstrated that 4% of nrbcs are positive for this antigen, whereas rbc staining was negligible . ρ-globin, which is still prominently expressed in both e <dig> and e <dig> rbcs  <cit> , was used as a positive control for yolk sac ish . ρ expression was observed in the majority of circulating cells, but was negative in certain infrequent cells presenting non-rbc morphology.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, gene expression profiling of nrbcs in the chick embryo has revealed the expression of a set of genes indicative of a wide range of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors primarily of either the erythroid or myeloid lineages present in early circulation. it has indeed been postulated that cells with an "erythromyeloid" potential constitute the first subset of hscs with potential for liver engraftment and eventual long-term hematopoiesis in the bone marrow  <cit> . lastly, the identification of several previously undescribed genes may prompt closer examination of their functions in chick and other model organisms. we, however, do not observe a prominent difference in expression profiles between e <dig> nrbcs and e <dig> nrbcs, during which period the second wave of hsc generation is actively taking place in the peri-aortic region, transiting from the initial appearance of intra-aortic clusters at about e <dig> to the formation of para-aortic foci at e <dig>  <cit> . it is therefore unclear whether the nrbcs we detect in e4- <dig> circulation, with the profiles of hematopoietic cells and progenitors, represent those from yolk sac or peri-aortic cells.
