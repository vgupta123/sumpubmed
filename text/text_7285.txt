BACKGROUND
malignant cells in tumour tissues of b-cell origin account for  <dig> % to 98% of the total cell content depending on the specific disease entity  <cit> . varying content in the b-cell tumours of normal leucocytes, lymphocytes and stromal cells with their own individual geps poses a challenge for identification of specific malignant b-cell signatures  <cit> . although several studies have successfully identified gene expression patterns of tumour samples, their interpretation is often confounded by a lack of information about the varying presence of normal cells within the tumour biopsies. in recent years, microarray technology has been the default technology for detection of global gep in different cancer types  <cit> . however, it is difficult to quantify expression of low-abundant mrna transcripts by microarrays, since low hybridisation intensity signals are difficult to distinguish from background levels arising from non-specific hybridisation. due to an absence of background signals, ngs technologies, including tag-seq, have the potential to out-perform or at least supplement the exon microarray  <cit> . however, there is a need to explore the technical limits of the exon microarray and tag-seq for identification and interpretation of mrna transcript profiles, in particular malignant b-cells in a pool of non-malignant cells.

the affymetrix genechip human exon  <dig>  st array is a dense microarray designed for gep, featuring  <dig>  million probes corresponding to known targets and predicted exons spanning the entire human genome  <cit> . the probes interrogate different regions of the same mrna transcript showing variation in probe-target hybridisation intensities across the transcript. this variation is sequence-dependent and affected by probe-target binding strength. the probe-target binding strength is affected by competing formation of probe-probe dimers and secondary structures in probes, resulting in background noise from which low hybridisation intensity signals can be difficult to distinguish  <cit> . gene expression levels are measured as probe-target hybridisation intensities, and all values are background corrected, with the inter-array quantile normalised to remove systematic biases, providing relative rather than absolute gene expression levels  <cit> . the next-generation sequencing-based tag-seq technology uses two restriction enzymes, nlaiii and mmei, to generate cdna tags that are reverse transcribed from mrna transcripts, by cutting from the 3′-end catg to the poly-tail and 17– <dig> bp downstream of the first restriction enzyme site  <cit> . clonal copies of each cdna tag are generated on a solid surface flow cell using a bridge amplification approach without any predefined array attached probes before sequencing. during sequencing, the numerical frequencies of each tag are recorded and provide absolute gene expression values  <cit> .

the present study is based on a model system, where malignant b-cells were serially diluted into embryonic kidney cells at eight different cellular frequencies illustrating varying levels of malignant b-cell sample purities. total rna from each of the cell populations was tested in parallel to generate data, both by exon microarrays using the affymetrix genechip human exon  <dig>  st platform and tag-seq using the illumina genome analyzer platform, as well as rt-qpcr validation of three selected genes. the goal for this work was to develop a quantification method that could be used for assessing and comparing the ability to detect malignant b-cell transcripts based on exon microarray and tag-seq as a function of sample purity.

RESULTS
detection ability of exon microarray and tag-seq
to compare the detection abilities, serial dilutions of eight samples of mixed cell populations from the human malignant b-cell line, oci-ly <dig>  into the human embryonic kidney cell line, hek <dig>  at the cellular frequencies 0%,  <dig> %, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 100% malignant b-cells, were prepared by fluorescent activated cell sorting . this dilution scheme was chosen to demonstrate resolution detection for small amounts of malignant b-cells. total rna from all samples was prepared and analysed using the two technologies in question. overall, mrna expression levels of  <dig>  refseq transcripts and full-length mrna transcripts using the core probes of the exon microarray were determined, and the number of unique genes detected above background  was  <dig> . in parallel, exactly the same total rna from all samples was used to prepare small tags of  <dig> bp cdna sequences, which yielded  <dig> - <dig>  million reads per sample . in two of the samples, a high number of reads was noticed. this was probably the consequence of a repetition of the pre-processing for these two samples as they did not meet the quality standards in the first pre-processing. the sub-sampling, however, successfully remedied this problem. of each sample,  <dig> - <dig> % of the reads were mapped to the ensembl homo sapiens cdna reference transcriptome , allowing  <dig> mismatch per read. summarising reads from all samples,  <dig>  unique reads were identified and  <dig> % of these were annotated, while  <dig> % did not match any known human mrna transcript sequence. the unique reads from all eight samples were summarised to gene levels, resulting in the detection of expression of a total of  <dig>  unique genes. the average number of tags per gene was  <dig> , while  <dig>  genes were both dabg by the exon microarray and identified by tag-seq. the entire data generation and analysis flow is illustrated in additional file  <dig> 

differentially expressed genes by exon microarray and tag-seq
differentially expressed genes were determined between the pure oci-ly <dig> and hek <dig> cell line samples using a false discovery rate  of less than 5%. these settings identified  <dig> genes by exon microarray and  <dig> genes by tag-seq. however, only  <dig> genes were concordant, as indicated in figure 1a and listed in table  <dig>  the hypothesis that the common set of genes was caused by pure chance was clearly rejected   <cit> . a correspondence curve  shows that the common set of genes among the most significant genes for each method is not caused by pure chance. of the  <dig> concordant genes,  <dig> genes were highly expressed in the pure oci-ly <dig> cell line compared to the hek <dig> cell line. the majority  of the differentially expressed genes encoded the cluster of differentiation  molecules , cd <dig> , cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd79a and b), human leukocyte antigen molecules , transcriptional regulators , b-cell-specific scaffold proteins , creatine kinase isoenzymes , deubiquitinating enzymes , actin-binding proteins , glycosyltransferases , uncharacterised proteins , and signal transduction molecules . the full lists of differentially expressed genes are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

hierarchical clustering of all samples
for both exon microarray and tag-seq, hierarchical clustering of all samples based on the  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes resulted in three individual concordant clusters . one cluster contained the samples with frequencies of 0%,  <dig> % and 1% malignant b-cells, a second cluster of 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% malignant b-cells, and a cluster of the sample containing 100% malignant b-cells. samples with less than 1% malignant b-cells were not distinguishable by hierarchical clustering from the non-b-cells of hek <dig> in either exon microarray or tag-seq. hierarchical clustering of all samples based on all genes are shown in additional file  <dig> 

comparison of background level and instrument detection limit 
of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed between the 100% and 0% samples detected by exon microarray, we identified  <dig> b-cell specific genes that were expressed more highly in the 100% b-cell sample. to see whether these  <dig> b-cell specific mrna transcripts were present in the background of the non-b-cells, the proportion of b-cell specific mrna transcripts with dabg was plotted as a function of sample purity , indicating an increased ability to detect b-cell specific mrna transcripts as a function of sample purity. only 4%  of the b-cell specific mrna transcripts had dabg for the pure hek <dig> cell line sample. the expression values for the  <dig> transcripts with dabg were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   and therefore only borderline expressed. this indicates that very few false-positive b-cell specific mrna transcripts were detectable in the pure hek <dig> cell line sample. of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes between 100% and 0% samples detected by tag-seq,  <dig> genes were expressed more highly in the 100% b-cell sample. all had counts equal to zero except for  <dig> genes  that had counts of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively in the pure hek <dig> cell lines, demonstrating very few, if any, false-positive b-cell specific mrna transcripts using the tag-seq technology.

to define where true mrna transcripts were present and where background levels make detection impossible, the instrument detection limits  of exon microarray and tag-seq were determined. by regression of the mrna expression levels of the b-cell specific differentially expressed genes versus sample purity under the assumption of a common background as intercept and gene-individual slopes, the idl was determined for both technologies . for exon microarray, the resulting residual standard deviation was estimated to be σ =  <dig>  resulting in an idl of  <dig> when 95% confidence was used. the linear model was controlled by standardised residual plots. for exon measurements we noticed  <dig> outliers and for fitted values below the idl a clear tendency to measurements being below the regression line . for measurements with a fitted value above the idl and an absolute value below  <dig> we noticed a small tendency to increasing variance  and deviation from the normal distribution . for tag-seq, the linear mean-variance negative binomial regression nb <dig> yielded an idl of  <dig>  whereas the nb <dig> model yielded an idl of  <dig>  the nb <dig> and nb <dig> models were controlled by quantile residual plots . these plots showed reasonable fits, but the deviance of nb <dig>  was lower than the deviance of nb <dig> . therefore we chose to continue with the nb <dig> model.

comparison of method detection limit 
the ability to detect genes was quantified by plotting the mdl as a function of sample purity . for both exon microarray and tag-seq, the decrease in the ability to detect mrna expression levels was inversely proportional to sample purity. the mdl met the idl at 100% sample purity.

as cd <dig>  hla-dra, and bcl <dig> are all transcripts of importance in b-cell development, and they were among the  <dig> concordant differentially expressed genes between exon microarray and tag-seq, they were selected for comparison and verification of the mdl as a function of sample purity . for exon microarray, the mrna expression levels of all three genes followed an approximately linear relationship with sample purity , whereas larger fluctuations around a linear relationship were observed for all three genes in tag-seq . higher mrna expression levels were obtained for cd <dig> and hla-dra compared to bcl <dig> by both exon microarray and tag-seq, supporting that the latter was expressed in low abundance in malignant b-cells. thus, samples should contain ≥5% malignant b-cells for detection of cd <dig>  ≥13% for detection of hla-dra and ≥22% for detection of bcl <dig> by exon microarray. similarly, the tag-seq ability to detect cd <dig>  hla-dra and bcl <dig> were at least 2%, 4%, and 51% malignant b-cells.

validation of gene expression levels by rt-qpcr
the mrna expression levels of cd <dig>  hla-dra, and bcl <dig> in all sample dilutions were validated by rt-qpcr and plotted as a function of the sample purity, revealing a linear relationship for all four genes . the mrna expression levels for all three genes, obtained by exon microarray and tag-seq as well as rt-qpcr, were compared by calculating pair wise spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. high correlations were observed between exon microarray and rt-qpcr, as well as tag-seq and rt-qpcr, for all three genes . the exon array showed better correlation to qpcr than tag-seq did.

discussion
the presence of tumour-infiltrating non-malignant cells is expected to mask the detection capacity of geps of malignant b-cells  <cit> . this study, however, suggests a novel quantitative tool for the assessment and comparison of the ability of microarrays and next generation sequencing to detect mrna transcripts from malignant b-cells in a pool of non-malignant cells. several studies have compared exon microarrays and next generation technologies  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, no studies have developed quantitative methods which are able to assess the ability of exon microarray and tag-seq to detect transcripts as a function of sample purity. we deliberately chose to make a model system that ensured distinct differences in cellular origin in order to observe clearly differentially expressed genes, enabling us to identify possible difficulties within such a model system.

a comparable number of differentially expressed genes between the pure samples of oci-ly <dig> and hek <dig> cell lines was identified by the two technologies . although the number of differentially expressed genes in common between the two technologies was small across a number of fdr settings, it was not caused by pure chance . one factor for this could be false negatives entering due to the lack of replicates at 0% and 100% sample purity. one could also speculate that the small number of commonly expressed genes may be explained by different shortcomings of the platforms, as probes on the exon microarray detect differentially expressed genes that either contain or do not contain the nlaiii restriction enzyme site, whereas tag-seq only catches differentially expressed genes with the unique catg sequence. therefore, some mrna transcripts may not be detected by tag-seq due to absence of the catg sequence, and some mrna transcripts may not be detected by exon microarrays due to inadequate probe design for exon microarrays  <cit> . however, we only found  <dig> gene differentially expressed by exon microarray that did not contain the nlaiii restriction site.

a majority of the differentially expressed genes that overlap between exon microarray and tag-seq were b-cell specific mrna transcripts, including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd79a, hla-dra, bcl <dig>  bank <dig>  c13orf <dig>  and tcl1a . most of the b-cell specific genes were related to cell surface-expressed antigens, which is consistent with the importance of interactions with external environment in defining the characteristics of b-cells.

uniform patterns of relatedness of samples between exon microarray and tag-seq were observed by hierarchical clustering. even though only  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes were common between exon microarray and tag-seq, the underlying expression patterns of mrna transcripts were sufficient to ensure similar results on the relatedness between samples by exon microarray and tag-seq. samples with ≤1% malignant b-cells were indistinguishable from the pure non-b-cell sample for exon microarray and tag-seq. thus, >1% malignant b-cells should be presented in biopsies for detection of a malignant b-cell profile by exon microarray and tag-seq, given the model system and data at hand .

based on concepts from analytical chemistry, it was possible to show how the ability to detect single genes  increases with sample purity . both exon microarray and tag-seq showed limitations when studying low-abundant mrna transcripts. a topic for future work is to define the precision estimates of the idls, mdls and background levels as a function of dilution density and replicates. these results are important for designing future detection ability studies. when the precision estimates have been improved with other data sets it will be possible to establish guidelines on how low expression levels of mrna transcripts are detectable in the original sample for a given sample purity, and thus, give advice on the detection abilities of e.g. low-abundant transcription factors and stem cell genes.

variance inhomogeneity was observed for the residuals of the linear model used for the exon microarray . we noticed that, for fitted values below the idl, there is a clear tendency to measurements being below the regression line. this is probably due to the measurements being below background in the region and a horizontal regression line would be more appropriate, suggesting a piecewise regression model. this is an important observation as the usual convolution models used in the de-convolution of signals from measurement in array data does not take an idl into account. this will, however, lead to more complicated idl and background correction calculations and is left for future research. over-dispersion of gene count data from ngs data is well documented see e.g  <cit> . in this paper we resolved this by using the quadratic mean variance negative binomial model, i.e. nb <dig>  when detecting differentially expressed genes, whereas we used the linear meanvariance negative binomial model, i.e. nb <dig>  when analysing the idl. nb <dig> is not supported in the edger package but we discovered that nb <dig> was sufficient for the negative binomial regression by residual plots  and comparison of deviances. we found that resolving the problem of finding the most appropriate dispersion model estimates for ngs data was outside the scope of the present paper, but it is an important topic for future research.

the ability to detect single genes by exon microarray and tag-seq was exemplified by analysing the mrna expression levels as a function of sample purity for three different b-cell mrna transcripts. the mrna expression levels of cd <dig>  hladra, and bcl <dig> followed a linear relationship as a function of sample purity for exon microarray, whereas larger fluctuations were observed for tag-seq . feng et al. demonstrated an increased coefficient of variation when detecting low-abundant mrna transcripts by tag-seq  <cit> . with increased sequencing depth, detection of low-abundant mrna transcript will probably become more accurate  <cit> . feng et al. described the relationship between total sequence volume and information of mrna expression levels as a sigmoid function. this means the deeper the sequencing, the greater the information  <cit> . the present work demonstrates that the difference in the ability to detect the three genes above depends on the sample purity and the initial abundance in the pure b-cell sample. tag-seq showed a tendency to have higher ability to detect highly abundant transcripts compared to exon microarray, supporting previous observations  <cit> .

based on the analysis of the three selected single genes, we demonstrated that the best detection ability corresponds to the highly abundant malignant b-cell transcripts, and there was an actual loss in the ability to detect low-abundant mrna transcripts in samples with low purity. for bcl <dig>  as a low-abundant gene, it was evident that a malignant b-cell frequency above 20-50% was required for reliable transcript detection. this supports the observed proportional relationship between the ability to detect genes and increasing sample purity.

the next obvious step for a follow-up study within this theme is to make serial dilutions of malignant b-cells into normal b-cells, t-cells and macrophages. our results show that basic requirements of detection abilities can be identified and detection capabilities can be studied in a formal framework. other directions for future studies include rna-seq on the entire poly-a fraction. this may help to detect even very low-abundant transcript, possibly helping to identify malignant b-cell specific transcript, i.e. alternative splicing isoforms, which are missed by tag-seq or more interestingly the fusion transcripts, which are cancer-specific and may dramatically help to create the conditions for establishing a future model system.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, it was demonstrated that the developed methodological tools are valuable in assessing the ability to detect genes by high-throughput platforms capable of screening samples for tumour-specific mrna transcripts, but more extensive studies are needed to give general advice on the choice of optimal technology. an important future perspective when assessing and comparing the detection capabilities of high-throughput platforms is to validate the usefulness of the proposed model system and analysis setup, by diluting pure malignant lymphoma samples with normal lymph node tissue.
