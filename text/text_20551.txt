BACKGROUND
complex insertions and deletions  are a known class of genetic variation  <cit>  associated with human diseases  <cit> . simultaneous deletion and insertion of dna fragments of different sizes lead to net change in length. no net change in length is also possible in case of contiguous or non-contiguous multiple-nucleotide variants . compared with lower-throughput sanger sequencing, analysis of next-generation sequencing data relies more on bioinformatics algorithms for automated variant calling. of concern, recent studies revealed the shortcomings of state-of-the-art variant callers that might fail to detect somatic and germline complex indels  <cit> . important mutations in key disease driver genes could be missed in ngs-based genomics studies .

pindel-c  <cit>  was introduced to detect the complex indels missed by gatk  <cit>  and varscan  <cit>  but the implementation was not yet publicly available. amplicon indel hunter  <cit>  and scanindel  <cit>  were designed for those that led to >5 bp net change in length or soft-clipping, respectively. mac  <cit>  targeted mnv only by analyzing single nucleotide variant  calls of primary callers.

here we present indelseek, a software that directly calls somatic and germline complex indels from sequence alignment/map  alignments regardless of net change in length.

implementation
the indelseek algorithm was implemented as a single perl script indelseek.pl that scans each ngs read alignment and identifies closely spaced substitutions, insertions or deletions in cis as potential complex indel regardless of net change in length. the only external dependency is samtools version  <dig>  or above  <cit> , which supports sequencing depth exceeding 8000x in case of deep amplicon sequencing. it was tested on both centos linux  <dig>  and cray xc <dig> supercomputer  and can be run on the built-in perl  <dig> installation of any linux/unix-like environment. alignments of ngs reads in the de facto sam/bam format  <cit>  serve as input while any complex indel calls will be reported in variant call format  version  <dig>   <cit> .

indelseek was designed to identify complex indel at single read level by examining each alignment as a whole . in contrast, mainstream ngs variant callers examined each reference position across multiple alignments , losing the haplotype information in case of multiple differences compared to reference. mainstream ngs read aligners  usually align complex indels as multiple mismatches, insertions and/or deletions  operations m, i and d, respectively) clustered within a short window of reference/read positions, which indelseek was designed to detect. since cigar operation m could represent either match or mismatch, it was first refined as operations = for match and x for mismatch. indelseek considers each window fulfilling all of these criteria as a complex indel call:  containing at least two x, i and/or d operations that are at most l nucleotides away from each other;  length at least two nucleotides. the parameter l is five by default and is configurable through option --max_distance. for enhanced specificity, false positives can be marked and/or removed based on configurable filters of read base quality, allele frequency and allele depth.fig.  <dig> indelseek algorithm as illustrated by the brca <dig> complex indel of sample  <dig>  left: indelseek directly reads ngs read alignments in the standard sam/bam format. after refining matches and mismatches in the supplied alignments, clusters of closely spaced mismatches, insertions and/or deletions are identified as potential complex indel calls. false positives are removed according to filters based on read base quality, allele frequency and allele sequencing depth. final complex indel calls are reported in the standard vcf format. right: a representative bwa-mem alignment of a sample  <dig> ngs read was shown. the corresponding reference sequence  and base calls of the read were shown above the below the alignment, respectively. in the alignment refinement step, m operators were refined as matches  and mismatches . a cluster of closely spaced variants was identified as a potential complex indel call . the complex indel call passed the defined quality thresholds and was reported as a variant call in vcf format, which corresponds to the brca <dig> complex indel c.4467_4474delinstgttttt




indelseek parameters were --skip_lowqual --skip_lowdepth --skip_lowaf --min_af  <dig>  for germline brca <dig> and brca <dig> mutations, --skip_lowqual --skip_lowdepth --skip_lowaf --min_af  <dig>  for somatic calr, jak <dig> and kit mutations, and --skip_lowqual --skip_lowdepth --skip_lowaf --max_distance  <dig> --min_af  <dig>  --min_depth  <dig> for na <dig> whole-genome sequencing  dataset. a single cpu core  was measured to be capable to process  <dig>  alignments per minute .

RESULTS
we benchmarked complex indel detection performance of gatk, samtools and indelseek using an external wgs dataset of the hapmap na <dig> genome  and the corresponding high-confidence variant calls from the genome in a bottle  consortium  <cit> . although the high-confidence variant calls did not comprise complex indels as individual calls, we observed clusters of closely spaced variants calls that appeared in cis in the alignments of individual sequencing reads. accordingly,  <dig> such loci from giab calls were manually curated as putative complex indels  in the intersection  of giab high confidence regions and consensus coding sequence project protein-coding sequences and 10 bp intronic flanking regions  <cit> . we also observed closely spaced snv that appeared in trans in the alignments and  <dig> such loci were manually curated as negative controls for complex indel detection . samtools and gatk did not call any complex indel from the putative giab complex indels  and negative controls , demonstrating 0% sensitivity and 100% specificity. the results were concordant with recent studies that complex indels were mostly missed by bioinformatics pipelines based on common variant callers  <cit> . indelseek called all putative giab complex indels  and did not call any from negative controls , demonstrating 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity . all three types of complex indels resulting in net deletion of bases, no net change in length, or net insertion of bases were detected . in the context of complex indel detection, the whole-alignment-based approach of indelseek was demonstrated to be superior to the conventional “pileup” approach of common variant callers.table  <dig> evaluation of indelseek complex indel detection performance

the general applicability of indelseek in complex indel detection was further assessed using a wider spectrum of complex indels, which showed different combination of deletion and insertion lengths  and different gene context . we collected  <dig> unique complex indels from public databases dbsnp and cosmic for semi-simulation by in silico engineering of complex indels in real ngs datasets. base quality scores were kept unchanged or similar to flanking bases depending on the net gain in bases . ngs data of na <dig>  a brca1/brca <dig> complex indel-negative sample, and a healthy adult were selected for engineering from the wgs, hboc and mn datasets, respectively. indelseek demonstrated sensitivities of  <dig> %  for wgs,  <dig> %  for hboc and  <dig> %  for mn .

as a discovery cohort, indelseek was applied to an additional mn panel dataset of  <dig> core-binding factor leukemia samples that were clinically predicted to be enriched for somatic mutations of kit exon  <dig>  <cit> . a total of  <dig> kit in-frame complex indels were detected from six of the samples  and verified by orthogonal validation experiments .

to demonstrate the importance of accurate complex indel detection in clinical settings, we focused on  <dig> mnv in hboc genes  and compared their variant annotation results  in two scenarios:  original mnv and  decomposing mnv into individual single-nucleotide variant for separate annotation, as if the mnv could not be called as a haplotype. comparison revealed marked difference in  <dig>  mnv, which showed gained  or rescued  protein-truncating effects . without accurate calling of complex indels, these mnv would become false negative or false positive pathogenic mutations, respectively. on the other hand, variant effect predictor was tested to natively support complex indels called by indelseek in vcf format.table  <dig> gained or rescued protein-truncating effect of complex indels

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that common variant callers fail to detect complex indels, a finding consistent with recent studies  <cit> . we also demonstrated that if complex indels were called as individual variant calls , the gained or rescued protein-truncating effects will be mis-interpreted. indelseek was demonstrated as an accurate and versatile complex indel caller, which is compatible with somatic and germline genomics studies, ngs data of random fragments and pcr amplicons, and all three classes of complex indels . since indelseek was implemented as a single perl script that directly reads sam/bam alignments and returns complex indel calls in vcf format, it can be readily incorporated into common bioinformatics workflows without any compilation and installation. indelseek complements other common variant callers in academic and diagnostic ngs-based genomics studies.
