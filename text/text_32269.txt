BACKGROUND
poly polymerase- <dig>  and parp- <dig> belong to the parp family, which consists of  <dig> predicted members that share a catalytic domain homologous to that of parp- <dig>  <cit> . these enzymes use nad+ as a substrate, synthesize adp-ribose molecules, and transfer them onto the glutamate, aspartate, or lysine residues of acceptor proteins. polyation regulates nuclear functions and responses that include dna repair, replication, transcription, and chromatin modification. after exposure to genotoxic chemicals, such as dna alkylating agents, parp- <dig> binds to the dna strand breaks, resulting in a change of conformation and increase of its enzymatic activity by 10– <dig> fold . the modified acceptor proteins, including histones and parp- <dig> itself, greatly change their size by harboring up to several hundred adp-ribose residues  <cit> . the polyanionic structure thus formed counteracts the inhibitory effect of histones on dna ligase. conversely, excessive activation of parp- <dig> and depletion of nad+ after severe dna damage cause cell death by atp depletion or an “energy crisis”  <cit> . previously, we reported a principal role for parp- <dig> in the induction of mitochondrial impairment that ultimately leads to neuronal apoptosis after cerebral ischemia  <cit> , indicating that parp inhibitors could be a good therapeutic intervention for cerebral infarction.

parp inhibitors such as 3-aminobenzamide  interact with the nicotinamide pocket of parp- <dig>  which is a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of parps, and act as competitors of nad+  <cit> . therefore, these inhibitors can suppress the activity of various parps with a homogeneous catalytic domain. more recently, however, several parp inhibitors selective for parp- <dig> or parp- <dig> have been developed to study their specific function or potential therapeutic application  <cit> . as little is known about the effects of parp inhibitors on somatic stem cells, these effects should be taken into consideration, particularly for their clinical use.

in the adult human and rodent brain, neural stem/progenitor cells  exist in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and propagate to the olfactory bulb  <cit> . nspcs are also present in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and possibly contribute to spatial memory formation and cognition  <cit> . in these regions, neurogenesis occurs even in physiological conditions. however, under various types of brain injury, such as stroke, epileptic seizures, and trauma, the generation and proliferation of neural precursor cells are induced both in the subgranular and subventricular zones. the majority of neurons generated in the subventricular zone migrate toward the lesion site to replace damaged neurons and induce neural regeneration  <cit> .

mutation of the p <dig> gene is observed frequently in cancer  <cit> . the function of p <dig> as a tumor suppressor depends principally on its ability to suppress cellular proliferation that would otherwise form tumor tissue. activation of p <dig> induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . these functions of p <dig> result from its role as a transcription factor  <cit> . among the identified p53-target genes, p <dig> plays a critical role in the induction of cell cycle arrest  <cit> . p <dig> is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that induces both the g <dig> and g <dig> cell cycle arrest observed after p <dig> activation . conversely, p <dig> induces apoptosis by activating some genes that participate in the apoptotic response. furthermore, p <dig> plays a critical role in preventing the reprogramming of cells carrying various types of dna damage  <cit> . silencing of p <dig> significantly enhances the efficiency of the reprogramming of human somatic cells  <cit> .

in the present study, we investigated the effects of parp inhibitors on nspcs in the adult brain and found two different effects, i.e., suppression of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. interestingly, both effects are mediated by the activation of p <dig>  it is worthy of special mention that more polyated proteins existed in nspcs than in mouse embryonic fibroblasts . on the basis of these results, parp, or polyation, could play a principal role in the maintenance of nspc multipotency through the suppression of p <dig> function.

methods
separation and passage of nspcs
all experimental protocols conformed to the fundamental guidelines for proper conduct of animal experiment and related activities in academic research institutions under the jurisdiction of the ministry of education, culture, sports, science, and technology, japan, and all experiments were approved by the animal experiment committee of osaka ohtani university . nspcs were obtained from slc:icr mouse embryos  as described previously . the cells were dissociated and suspended at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells in 100-mm dishes in 1× dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium /f- <dig> neurosphere medium supplemented with b- <dig> , 20 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor  , and 20 ng/ml human recombinant fibroblast growth factor -basic . the culture medium was changed every other day and the cells were dissociated by using stempro accutase  every 4 days. the cells were passaged 3– <dig> times. untreated bacterial-grade culture dishes were used for suspension cultures, whereas dishes coated with poly-l-ornithine and fibronectin were used for monolayer cultures.

suppression of gene expression by shrna

parp-knockdown  and plko. <dig> empty vectors for short hairpin rna -expressing lentivirus were purchased from open biosystems. the rnai consortium  numbers were as follows: trcn <dig>  and trcn <dig> . lentivirus was produced by transient transfection of 293t cells using a trans-lentiviral shrna packaging kit . the virus supernatant was concentrated by using a lenti-x™ concentrator . for virus infection, nspcs were incubated with the concentrated virus supernatant in a 6-well plate and centrifuged at 1200×g for 1 h at 32 °c. the virus medium was removed at 6 h after infection and replaced with fresh medium. the infected cells were selected with 800 ng/ml puromycin at 2 days after infection. incubation was continued for an additional 2 days. silencing was then assessed by measuring the levels of parp <dig> and parp <dig> mrna using rt-pcr.

western blot analysis
nspcs  were seeded in 100-mm dishes containing the parp inhibitors or vehicle for 24 h. scraped cells were collected and added to a sample buffer solution containing 2-mercaptoethanol  for sds-page  and incubated at 95 °c for 5 min. proteins were separated using mini-protean tgx gels , transferred with the trans-blot turbo system , and detected with antibodies against the following proteins: beta-actin , p <dig> , p <dig> , phospho-p <dig>  , cleaved caspase- <dig>  , cleaved caspase- <dig>  , caspase- <dig> , poly , parp- <dig> , ataxia telangiectasia mutated  , and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related  . a peroxidase-linked secondary antibody  was used for detection. antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by immunostar ld . the chemiluminescent blots were imaged with a chemidoc xrs + imager  and analyzed by imagelab software version  <dig> . <dig> . all antibodies were distilled in hikari signal enhancer . for caspase activation, as a positive control, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml cycloheximide  for 24 h and 50 ng/ml mouse tumor necrosis factor-α  for 6 h.

cell cycle analysis
the cells were synchronized by the double-thymidine-block method as described previously, with minor modifications  <cit> .  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells were seeded in twenty five 100 mm plates. one plate was used for time  <dig> . one set of  <dig> plates was used for pj <dig> treatment, and another set of  <dig> plates was used for control. they were subjected to the first treatment with 2 mm thymidine  for 14 h, and then incubated in thymidine-free medium for 12 h, followed by the second treatment with 2 mm thymidine for 14 h to arrest the cell cycle at the g1/s boundary. the cells were washed twice with 1× dmem/f- <dig> and then incubated in neurosphere medium and analyzed every 2 h. the nuclei of the treated cells were collected and stained with propidium iodide using a cell cycle test-plus dna staining kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . the dna content of the stained nuclei was measured using a facscalibur flow cytometer . the results were analyzed by using modfit lt  <dig>  software .

flow cytometric analysis of cell death
after incubation with 20 μm pj <dig> for 24 h, the cells were collected by low-speed centrifugation, washed with ice-cold pbs, and resuspended in annexin-v binding buffer . to detect annexin-v-positive cells, the cells were incubated with annexin-v  and 7-aad  for 15 min at room temperature. the cells were analyzed with a facscalibur flow cytometer .

chromatin staining for the detection of apoptosis
nspcs were incubated with or without the parp inhibitors on poly-l-ornithine/fibronectin-coated lab-tek ii chamber slides  for 24 h. the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs for 10 min, followed by chromatin staining with 1 μg/ml hoechst  <dig>  to detect morphological changes of nuclei associated with apoptosis.

precipitation of polyated proteins
polyated proteins were isolated by using a highly specific af <dig> macrodomain poly affinity resin set . nspcs were incubated with or without 20 μm pj <dig> for 24 h. proteins were extracted from  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells using a lysis buffer  and incubated with the affinity resin overnight at 4 °c. the resin-bound proteins were dissociated from the affinity resin by incubation in sds-sample buffer at 95 °c for 10 min and analyzed by immunoblotting.

immunoprecipitation
nspcs were incubated with or without 20 μm pj <dig> for 24 h. cell lysates were prepared from  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells using ripa buffer . an antibody against p <dig> , atm , or atr  was added to the cell lysates, and μmacs protein a/g microbeads  were added to magnetically label the immune complexes. magnetically labeled proteins were collected by using μ columns and μmacs separator , and analyzed by immunoblotting.

statistical analysis
the data were expressed as the mean value ± standard error of the mean . we used one-way anova followed by tukey’s post hoc test to analyze the differences among the three or more groups, and used student’s t test for the differences between the two groups. results were considered statistically significant at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
suppression of neurosphere formation by parp inhibitors
nspcs from the mouse brain were incubated with or without the parp inhibitors . neurospheres were generated in the absence of the parp inhibitors after incubation for 2 days, while neurosphere formation was suppressed by the parp inhibitors in a concentration-dependent manner. neurospheres were almost absent with 15 mm 3ab, 200 μm dhiq, or 20 μm pj <dig> . the concentrations of the  <dig> inhibitors required for these biological effects on nspcs corresponded to their half maximal  inhibitory concentrations : ic50s of 3ab, dhiq, and pj <dig> were 33 μm, 390 nm, and 20 nm, respectively  <cit> . an approximately 1000-fold higher concentration of the inhibitors, as compared with their ic50s, effectively suppressed neurosphere formation by nspcs. we then evaluated the viability of nspcs by measuring mts-reducing activity, which was increased by  <dig> -fold after culture for 2 days in the absence of the parp inhibitors . this increase was significantly suppressed by the addition of the parp inhibitors , indicating that exposure to the parp inhibitors damages the viability of nspcs.fig.  <dig> suppression of neurosphere formation and cell viability of nspcs by parp inhibitors. a multiple neurospheres were detectable after a 2-day incubation of nspcs without a parp inhibitor , while the number and size of neurospheres were much smaller in the presence of a parp inhibitor  in a dose-dependent manner. b cell viability was determined by the mts assay. the mts-reduction activity of nspcs was suppressed by the addition of a parp inhibitor. data shown in  are expressed as the ratio of the mean value of the control  at time  <dig> . data represent the mean value ± sem . †

no induction of nspc differentiation by a parp inhibitor
while the parp inhibitors suppressed nspc neurosphere formation, a small population of nspcs attached to the bottom of the culture dish and extended projections, suggesting their differentiation into neurons or glial cells . we examined the phenotype of these cells by immunostaining for several cell type-specific markers: nestin for nspcs, tuj- <dig> for neurons, gfap for astrocytes, and cnpase for oligodendrocytes. tuj- <dig> or cnpase was undetectable after incubation with or without pj <dig> for 6 days, indicating no differentiation into neurons or oligodendrocytes, respectively, by this parp inhibitor. conversely, gfap was detectable in a subpopulation of nspcs both in the presence and absence of pj <dig>  indicating that nspcs could be differentiated into astrocytes under the present experimental conditions regardless of their exposure to this parp inhibitor. the ratio of nestin-positive cells appeared not to be changed by pj <dig>  suggesting no effects of this parp inhibitor on nspc differentiation. these morphological changes were supported by quantitative mrna analysis of cell type-specific markers . among these markers, gfap was only upregulated by a few fold after the addition of 20 μm pj <dig>  conversely, the expression of gfap increased by more than 600-fold after in vitro differentiation of nspcs into astrocytes. most of the cells stopped proliferating and became apoptotic, while only a small number of cells, which attached to the bottom of the dishes, morphologically changed and extended projections. it appears that the cells that attached, or survived, differentiated into astrocytes, which likely caused a weak but significant upregulation of gfap mrna.fig.  <dig> no induction of differentiation of nspcs into neurons or glial cells by a parp inhibitor. a the cells were triple-stained with hoechst  <dig> , anti-nestin antibody , and a cell-specific antibody: anti-tuj- <dig> antibody , anti-gfap antibody , or anti-cnpase antibody . although the morphology of nspcs was changed considerably after the addition of pj <dig>  the pattern of immunostaining was not changed. differential interference contrast  images were on the left side. the positive controls for the antibodies used here are shown in the small images. b quantitative mrna analyses at 24 h after the addition of pj <dig>  or 6 days after withdrawal of the growth factors egf and fgf for differentiation into astrocytes  were performed for cell type-specific markers: tuj- <dig> for neurons, nestin for nspcs, gfap for astrocytes, and cnpase for oligodendrocytes. among these markers, gfap was only upregulated by a few fold after the addition of 20 μm pj <dig>  while the expression of gfap increased by more than 600-fold after in vitro differentiation of nspcs into astrocytes. data shown in  are expressed as the ratio of the mean value of the control . data represent the mean value ± sem .*p <  <dig>   by comparison against control using one-way anova followed by tukey’s post hoc test. †

suppression of cell cycle progression by a parp inhibitor
we then assessed cell cycle progression in nspcs by thymidine incorporation. s phase cells were obtained by using a double thymidine block that arrests the cells at the g1/s boundary. the removal of thymidine by replacement with normal medium, with or without the parp inhibitor pj <dig>  induced the onset of the s phase. every 2 h from the onset of dna synthesis, the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry . the proportion of cells in the g2/m phase reached the maximum value at 6 h from the onset of the s phase in the absence of pj <dig>  while it took 8 h in the presence of pj <dig>  the peak of the proportion of cells in the g <dig> phase occurred after  <dig> or 10 h with or without pj <dig>  respectively. these results suggest that treatment with pj <dig> suppressed cell cycle progression in nspcs at the s phase and/or g2/m phase.fig.  <dig> suppression of cell cycle progression of nspcs by pj <dig>  progression of the cell cycle with or without pj <dig> was analyzed by thymidine incorporation, followed by flow cytometry. the ratios of cells in the g <dig>  s, and g2/m phases are illustrated every 2 h after the onset of the s phase. the results of flow cytometry at the peak of the g2/m or g <dig> phase are shown. data represent the mean value ± sem 




induction of apoptosis in nspcs by parp inhibitors
the suppression of cell viability led us to examine whether the parp inhibitors induce cell death, either necrosis or apoptosis, in nspcs. nuclear staining with hoechst  <dig> showed an intact or chromatin-condensed apoptotic pattern. apoptotic cells prevailed after exposure to the parp inhibitors  in a concentration-dependent manner .fig.  <dig> induction of apoptosis in nspcs by parp inhibitors. a nspcs were stained with hoechst  <dig> after a 24-h incubation with the parp inhibitors. cells with condensed chromatin, which is indicative of apoptosis, were detectable after the addition of pj <dig>  dhiq, or 3ab. the ratio of apoptotic cells increased in a dose-dependent manner. b the rate of annexin-v-positive cells after the addition of 20 μm pj <dig> was analyzed by the use of flow cytometry staining with apc-conjugated annexin-v and 7-aad. data represent the mean value ± sem . ‡
p <  <dig>  by comparison against control using student’s t test. scale bars in , 20μm




the pattern of cell death was then analyzed by the use of flow cytometry with apc-conjugated annexin-v and 7-aad. annexin-v has high affinity for phosphatidylserine that is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis. the cell membrane of live cells is impenetrable to 7-aad, but 7-aad readily permeates and stains dead cells. annexin-v/7-aad cells were considered to be at the early stage of apoptosis, whereas annexin-v/7-aad cells could be either necrotic or apoptotic at a later stage. treatment with pj <dig> significantly increased the proportion of apoptotic annexin-v/7-aad cells by 27% compared to 12% in the control cells and decreased that of intact annexin-v/7-aad cells by 71% compared to 87% in the control cells .

changes of mrna expression profiles in the p <dig> signaling pathway by parp inhibitors
in order to identify the causative genes that are involved in the pathway leading to the suppression of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis, microarray analyses were carried out. the mrna expression profiles in nspcs were compared between cells in the presence and absence of pj <dig>  we found  <dig> genes upregulated and  <dig> genes downregulated by pj <dig> with more than a twofold change . in addition, several genes related to the p <dig> signaling pathway were significantly upregulated after the addition of pj <dig>  as shown by differential expression analysis  . the upregulation of cdkn1a , which plays a critical role in the control of the cell cycle, was more than twofold in the two analyses performed. several genes in the pathway leading to apoptosis, including fas , pidd , pmaip <dig> , and bbc <dig> , were also upregulated by more than 2-fold. furthermore, ccng <dig> , which is involved in p <dig> negative feedback, was also upregulated. these results from the microarray analyses were confirmed by rt-pcr , indicating that pj <dig> and also the other parp inhibitors, dhiq and 3ab, activate the two pathways downstream of p53: one pathway leads to cell cycle arrest through the activation of p <dig>  while the other induces apoptosis by some apoptosis-related factors. interestingly, the rt-pcr results demonstrated that the amount of p <dig> mrna in nspcs was not changed by the parp inhibitors, whereas p <dig> protein was increased by the parp inhibitors . this inconsistency indicated that the increase of p <dig> protein was not due to the overexpression of trp <dig> , but to the suppression of p <dig> protein degradation. in this context, the phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser  <dig>  which inhibits the binding of mdm <dig> and stabilizes p <dig> protein, was found to be increased by the parp inhibitors. the amount of p <dig> protein was definitely increased by the parp inhibitors, which is consistent with the upregulation of p <dig> mrna expression. furthermore, activation of the p <dig> signaling pathway to apoptosis resulted in the cleavage of pro-caspase- <dig> table  <dig> statistically significant changed categories

in order to clarify which member of the parp family is responsible for these effects of pj <dig> on nspcs, we used quantitative mrna analysis to evaluate the effects of the inhibitors dr <dig> and upf <dig>  which are specific for parp- <dig> and parp- <dig>  respectively . dr <dig> upregulated the genes in the p <dig> signaling pathway in a similar way as pj <dig>  while upf <dig> did not change the expression of these genes, except bbc <dig> . these findings confirmed parp- <dig>  but not parp- <dig>  as a target enzyme of pj <dig> for its effects on the p <dig> signaling pathway in nspcs.

effects of parp- <dig> or parp- <dig> knockdown on the p <dig> signaling pathway in nspcs
we then carried out silencing of parp <dig> or parp <dig> by infection with shrna-expressing lentiviruses. parp <dig> or parp <dig> shrna reduced the expression of the target gene to approximately 10% compared with control shrna . genes in the p <dig> signaling pathway were upregulated by the suppression of parp <dig> expression, but not by parp <dig> suppression . these findings were consistent with those obtained in the inhibitor experiments, and indicate that parp- <dig>  but not parp- <dig>  regulates the functions of p <dig> in nspcs.fig.  <dig> effects of parp- <dig> or parp- <dig> knockdown on the p <dig> signaling pathway in nspcs. quantitative mrna analyses after silencing parp <dig> or parp <dig> by shrna-expressing lentivirus were performed for parp <dig> and parp <dig>  and the genes in the p <dig> signaling pathway . genes in the p <dig> signaling pathway were upregulated by the suppression of parp <dig> expression, but not by parp <dig> suppression. data shown in  are expressed as the ratio of the mean value of the sh control group. data represent the mean value ± sem . †

activation of p <dig> by parp inhibitors
the induction of apoptosis by the parp inhibitors was demonstrated again by the detection of cleaved caspase fragments . one of the effector caspases, caspase- <dig>  was activated, as revealed by the detection of the cleaved fragment  of pro-caspase- <dig>  among the initiator caspases, caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> were also demonstrated to be activated by the detection of the cleaved fragments of the pro-caspases p43/p41/p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively, although the band density of p <dig> was low.fig.  <dig> higher amounts of p <dig> protein and phosphorylated p <dig> in nspcs after parp inhibition. a cleaved fragments of caspase- <dig>  and caspase- <dig>  were clearly detectable by western blotting with specific antibodies. the cleaved fragment of pro-caspase- <dig>  was also detectable, although the band density of this fragment was low. b phase-contrast images were shown on the top. higher amounts of p <dig> protein and phosphorylated p <dig> in nspcs after parp inhibition were also revealed by immunocytochemistry. representative images from  <dig> separate experiments are shown. c western blot analysis demonstrated that parp- <dig> was abundant and activated in nspcs in contrast to mefs. amounts of p <dig> protein and phosphorylated p <dig> at ser  <dig> were remarkably increased by pj <dig>  scale bars in , 20μm




the increased amount of total p <dig> and its phosphorylated form after the addition of pj <dig> was revealed by immunostaining with antibodies against p <dig> and phosphorylated p <dig> , respectively . furthermore, nspcs contained much higher levels of parp- <dig> protein than mefs and this enzyme was constitutively activated, as revealed by its automodification, in nspcs . the 89-kda fragment of parp- <dig>  which is generated by its cleavage by activated caspase- <dig>  was also detectable. the increase of p <dig> protein and its phosphorylation in the presence of pj <dig> were observed in nspcs, but not in mefs.

effects of a parp inhibitor on trp53+/− and trp53−/− nspcs
in order to confirm a key role for p <dig> in the process under the regulation of polyation, we examined the effects of a parp inhibitor on trp53
−/− as well as trp53
+/− nspcs. parp inhibition by pj <dig> increased both total and phosphorylated p <dig> levels in wild-type and trp53
+/− nspcs . trp53
−/− nspcs formed larger neurospheres than trp53
+/− nspcs, while trp53
+/− nspcs generated a larger number of neurospheres than wild-type nspcs . after incubation with 10 μm or 20 μm pj <dig> for 2 days, only a few neurospheres were observed in wild-type nspcs. in trp53
+/− nspcs, neurospheres were still abundant in the presence of pj <dig> at 10 μm, but not at 20 μm, although the neurospheres became smaller. remarkably, even at a concentration of 20 μm, a substantial number of neurospheres were still present in trp53

cell viability was evaluated by measuring mts-reducing activity. it should be noted that trp53
−/− nspcs showed higher activity than wild-type or trp53
+/− nspcs in the absence of pj <dig> . after the addition of 10 μm or 20 μm pj <dig>  the mts-reducing activity of wild-type nspcs was decreased. pj <dig> also decreased the mts-reducing activity of trp53
+/− nspcs at a concentration of 20 μm, but not 10 μm, whereas that of trp53
−/− nspcs was increased even after the addition of pj <dig>  these results clearly indicate that the effect of the parp inhibitor pj <dig> on the viability of nspcs is mediated by p <dig> 

in order to confirm the mrna expression profiles in trp53
−/− nspcs, mrna levels were compared between the cells in the presence and absence of 20 μm pj <dig> by microarray analyses.  <dig> genes were upregulated by and  <dig> genes were downregulated by pj <dig>  however, there was no significantly changed category .

polyation of atm and atr
as demonstrated by the experiments using trp53
−/− nspcs, p <dig> plays a key role in the regulation of cell viability by the parp inhibitors. we then examined the molecular mechanism of p <dig> activation by the parp inhibitors. we performed a pull-down assay using poly-adp-ribose affinity resin, but were unable to isolate polyated p <dig> . an immunoprecipitation study using an anti-p <dig> antibody showed the increased quantity of p <dig> protein after exposure to the parp inhibitor pj <dig>  while polyation of p <dig> was undetectable.fig.  <dig> polyation of atm and atr, but not p <dig>  a polyated proteins were isolated from cell lysates by highly specific macrodomain poly affinity resin. the resin-bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by western blotting with an anti-p <dig> antibody. immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-p <dig> antibody. the resulting immunocomplexes were subjected to western blot analysis with anti-p <dig> and anti-poly antibodies. polyated p <dig> was undetectable irrespective of parp inhibition. b the same membrane on which the proteins eluted from poly affinity resin were transferred was analyzed by western blotting with anti-atm and anti-atr antibodies, resulting in the detection of atm and atr. c immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-atm or anti-atr antibody. immunocomplexes were subjected to western blot analysis with an anti-atm or anti-atr antibody as well as an anti-poly antibody. polyated atm and atr were detectable in the absence of pj34




as both atm and atr regulate the stability and activation of p <dig> by phosphorylation at ser <dig>  <cit> , we examined whether parp inhibition affects these  <dig> serine/threonine protein kinases. we performed a pull-down assay with poly-adp-ribose affinity resin, and detected both atm and atr at their expected sizes using specific antibodies . certainly, the addition of pj <dig> inhibited the isolation of both kinases by poly-adp-ribose affinity resin. polyation of these two kinases was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-atm or anti-atr antibody followed by detection with an anti-poly antibody . together with the finding of parp- <dig> activation in nspcs , both atm and atr were found to be constitutively polyated in these cells.

discussion
nspcs are localized in specific areas in the adult brain such as the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and subventricular area of the lateral ventricles  <cit> . once the brain is damaged by ischemia, nspcs are activated and move to the infarct area  <cit> . previously, we reported that parp inhibitors could be a good therapeutic intervention for ischemic brain disorders through inhibition of apoptosis as well as necrosis of the affected neurons  <cit> . lacza et al.  <cit>  reported an improvement of the effectiveness of neural stem cell transplantation through the suppression of the onoo−–parp activation cascade by parp inhibitor. however, administration of parp inhibitors might influence nspcs in the brain. in the present study, we demonstrated two types of effects of parp inhibitors on nspcs: suppression of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. from a therapeutic point of view, these effects should be taken into consideration to determine the appropriate doses of parp inhibitors.

the key molecule underlying these effects of the parp inhibitors was proven to be p <dig>  which restricts cellular growth by inducing cell cycle arrest  or apoptosis  <cit> . several factors that influence the decision between the two types of effect include the expression level of p <dig>  the type of stress signal, and cell type. under our experimental conditions for nspcs, where the cells were not exposed to specific stresses, the expression level of p <dig> was consistent and its phosphorylation, or activation, was suppressed. after the addition of the parp inhibitors, phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser <dig> was enhanced, followed by the upregulation of p <dig>  which is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression at the g <dig> and s phase  <cit> .

the parp inhibitor pj <dig> also upregulated other p53-dependent factors in the pathways to apoptosis, i.e., fas, pidd, dr <dig>  and perp in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and noxa and puma in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway  <cit> . the extrinsic pathway is mediated by particular death receptors that are members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, including fas, dr <dig>  and perp, whose activation induces the formation of the death-inducing-signaling-complex, and then activation of the caspase cascade, including caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  in our study, both caspases were definitely activated after parp inhibition, as revealed by the detection of the cleaved fragments of pro-caspases.

the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated in response to dna damage and results in mitochondrial depolarization and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm  <cit> . cytochrome c forms a complex “apoptosome” together with apoptotic protease-activating factor  <dig> and pro-caspase- <dig>  followed by the activation of caspase- <dig> and then activation of other caspases such as caspase- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  <cit> . pj <dig> induces the transcription of puma, also known as bcl-2-binding component  <dig> , which interacts with antiapoptotic bcl- <dig> family members, leading to the formation of the free-type of bax and/or bak, which are then able to signal apoptosis to the mitochondria  <cit> . intriguingly, a balance between puma and p <dig> reportedly determines the onset of cell cycle arrest, or death, in response to exogenous p <dig> expression. in our study, pj <dig> also upregulated another p <dig> target gene, noxa, which encodes a bh3-only protein and hence is considered to induce p53-mediated apoptosis in a manner similar to puma  <cit> . thus, it appears that, in response to parp inhibition, p <dig> activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by inducing the expression of at least two bcl- <dig> pro-apoptotic family members including puma and noxa. the fragment of pro-caspase- <dig>  however, was only slightly detectable, indicating that the involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was limited.

the interaction of p <dig> with parp- <dig> or polyation of p <dig> has been proposed by several investigators . the dna-binding domain of p <dig> contains some poly-binding sites, which could interfere with its site-specific dna-binding activity and block its transcriptional function  <cit> . alternatively, poly could induce the upregulation of p <dig> by protecting the protein from proteolytic degradation. one of the poly binding sites in p <dig> is located near a proteolytic cleavage site, which suggests that polymer binding might protect this sequence from proteolysis  <cit> . interestingly, kanai et al.  <cit>  reported that polyation of p <dig> blocked the interaction between p <dig> and the nuclear export receptor crm <dig>  followed by the accumulation of p <dig> in the nucleus and activation of its transactivation function. these findings are not necessarily consistent with ours in which polyated p <dig> was undetectable. this inconsistency may be due to differences in the type of cell and stress utilized.

some kinases, such as atm and atr, are reportedly responsible for the phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser <dig> , i.e., ser <dig>   <cit> . phosphorylation at this site, as observed in our study, and also at ser <dig> , could inhibit the binding of the p53-degrading enzyme mdm <dig> , resulting in the stabilization of p <dig>  <cit> . watanabe et al.  <cit>  reported that after the induction of dna double-strand breaks  in mefs by neocarzinostatin, parp- <dig> negatively regulated atm kinase activity and inhibited phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser <dig>  kedar et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that atr interacted with parp- <dig> after treatment with methyl methanesulfonate, but this interaction was not detectable after parp inhibition. under conditions of parp inhibition in mef culture, the cells accumulated in the s phase, probably due to atr activation. they also demonstrated that atr is a substrate for polyation by parp- <dig> in vitro. these results suggest that polyation of atm and/or atr after dsbs inactivates these kinases, leading to the inhibition of p <dig> phosphorylation. in our experiments using nspcs without induction of dsbs, both atm and atr were polyated or inactivated. the parp inhibitors removed this modification and activated these kinases, resulting in increased phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser <dig> and stabilization of this protein.

parps constitute a large family of as many as  <dig> proteins  <cit> , and parp- <dig> is an abundant nuclear protein and the founding member of the parp family. as poly is mainly synthesized by parp- <dig> after dna damage, parp- <dig> was initially thought to be a “backup of parp- <dig> ” on the contrary, parp-2
−/− mice exhibit impaired spermatogenesis  <cit> , adipogenesis  <cit> , and thymocyte survival  <cit> , although parp-1
−/− mice differentiate normally in these processes. thus, parp- <dig> might have different targets from parp- <dig>  suggesting that they could play specific biological functions. interestingly, parp-1/parp- <dig> double knockout mice, which lack polyation, are embryonic lethal  <cit> . therefore, both parp- <dig> and parp- <dig> are thought to conduct critical roles in embryonic development. our study using specific inhibitors and also shrnas suggested that parp- <dig>  but not parp- <dig>  plays a role in the regulation of p <dig> functions. in this study, puma, a pro-apoptotic protein located in the p53-signaling pathway, was upregulated after treatment with the parp-2-specific inhibitor upf <dig>  which may be due to an unknown function of upf <dig> besides parp-2-specific inhibition. this possibility should be investigated in further experiments.

recent reports have provided evidence that intracellular programs, including epigenetic modifications, transcription factors, and extracellular signals, such as various cytokines, are involved in the induction of nspc differentiation  <cit> . parp <dig> as well as tet <dig> are responsible for epigenetic modifications during the reprogramming process  <cit> . parp- <dig> expression was found to be enhanced both in embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem  cells. parp- <dig> activation plays a key role both in the induction of ips cells and the maintenance of pluripotency  <cit> . interestingly, several groups have reported that p <dig> suppresses ips cell generation and that its molecular mechanism involves two types of ability of p53: induction of p <dig>  resulting in a restriction of cell cycling, and induction of apoptosis  <cit> . on the basis of these findings and our predictive model, for the maintenance of nspc multipotency as well as pluripotency of ips cells, suppression of p <dig> function by parp- <dig> might be required.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate the possibility that parp- <dig> activation or polyation contributes to the proliferation of nspcs by advancing the cell cycle and suppressing apoptosis in addition to epigenetic modifications. inactivation of atm/atr and the p <dig> pathway is suggested to be a mechanism that explains how parp promotes proliferation and thus maintains nspc multipotency .fig.  <dig> a model of cell fate decision by polyation in nspcs. in normal conditions, both atm and atr are polyated and inactivated, leading to dephosphorylation of p <dig> at ser <dig>  the resulting inactivation of p <dig> promotes the self-renewal of nspcs and neurosphere formation. under parp inhibition, atm and/or atr without polyation are activated, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of p <dig>  the activated p <dig> signaling pathway delays cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis by different mechanisms
